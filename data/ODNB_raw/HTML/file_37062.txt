<span class="headword">Yeo,  Gerald Francis</span>  (1845&#150;1909), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born in Dublin on 19 January 1845, the second son of Henry Yeo of Ceanchor, Howth, JP, clerk of the rules in the court of exchequer, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Captain Ferns. Yeo was educated at the Royal School, Dungannon, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated moderator in natural science in 1866, proceeding MB and MCh in 1867. In 1868 he gained the gold medal of the Dublin Pathological Society for an essay on renal disease. After studying abroad for three years, a year each in Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, he proceeded MD at Dublin in 1871, and became next year MRCP and MRCS Ireland. For two years he taught physiology in the Carmichael school of medicine in Dublin.<br>
<br>Yeo was appointed professor of physiology in King's College, London, in 1874, and in 1877 assistant surgeon to King's College Hospital, becoming FRCS England in 1878. However, he resigned his clinical appointment in 1880 in order to devote his time to physiology. He delivered for the College of Surgeons the Arris and Gale lectures on anatomy and physiology in 1880&#150;82. He used the lectures to illustrate how far experimentation had advanced the cause of science in the previous thirty years. Yeo did much good work with David Ferrier, a fellow professor of neuropathology at King's College, on the cerebral localization in monkeys, work which was then entirely new, but brought them threat of prosecution for vivisection. As Ferrier had not been allowed a vivisection licence under the 1877 act it was Yeo who did the operative work.<br>
<br>Yeo is perhaps best known as being the first secretary of the Physiological Society, of which he was one of the founders in 1875. At first this was mainly a mutual protection society against the intrigues of antivivisectionists, but later became a learned society. Yeo conducted the society's affairs with tact and energy (although he was an indifferent minute taker) until his resignation in 1890, when he was presented with a silver tea service. In conjunction with K. H. Kr&ouml;necker of Bern, Yeo inaugurated the international physiological congresses which were held triennially; the first met at Basel in 1891.<br>
<br>Yeo was elected FRS in 1889. He resigned his chair of physiology at King's College in 1890 and received the title of emeritus professor. He then retired to Totnes, Devon, and later to Fowey, where he devoted himself to yachting, fishing, and gardening. Yeo married first, in 1873, Charlotte, the only daughter of Isaac Kitchin of Rockferry, Cheshire (she died childless in 1884); and second, in 1886, Augusta Frances, second daughter of Edward Hunt of Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, with whom he had one son.<br>
<br>Yeo, who spoke several languages, was a fluent speaker with a rich brogue. He was good-natured, generous, full of common sense. His <span class="italic">Manual of Physiology for the Use of Students of Medicine</span> (1884) was a useful and popular textbook. He contributed numerous scientific papers on bile, heart muscle, skeletal muscle, and heart sounds to the <span class="italic">Proceedings and Transactions of the Royal Society</span> and to the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span>. He died at his home, Austin's Close, Harbertonford, Devon, on 1 May 1909.<br>
