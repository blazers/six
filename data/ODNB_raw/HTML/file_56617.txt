<span class="headword">Pickersgill,  Joseph</span>  (1849/50&#150;1920), <span class="occ">racecourse bookmaker</span>, grew up in Leeds, but little else is known about his origins. He began work as butcher's boy, after which he may have become an off-course bookmaker at &#145;The Midden&#146;. This was an open space where bookies gathered because street betting was not banned in Leeds in the late nineteenth century. It is doubtful if Pickersgill did lay bets at The Midden, as one bookie recalled that it was used first in 1886, by which date Pickersgill was already a wealthy racecourse bookmaker.<br>
<br>What is certain is that by the 1870s Pickersgill was one of a number of prominent layers (bookmakers) from Lancashire and Yorkshire. They were men who led the market not only on northern racecourses but also on those in the south of England. Pickersgill himself &#145;became one of the big noises in the profession&#146;  (Fairfax-Blakeborough, &#145;Memories&#146;, 105). He achieved a high reputation and was familiarly known as Honest Joe (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 August 1920). Edward VII always betted with him, as did many aristocrats.<br>
<br>For a short time Pickersgill ran his own horses, training them with James Watson of Richmond, Yorkshire. His colours were registered as white, green seams, and black cap. Pickersgill had only one successful runner, Robbie Burns, which won several races as a three-year old in 1879. He<blockquote>enjoyed the fun and &#145;thrill&#146; of having his own horses running, but found it was damaging both his pocket and his reputation because of the ill-unfounded suspicions of those who are so ready to assume that owners can arrange for their horses to win when the odds suit them, and to be down the course when the betting market was not favourable. (Fairfax-Blakeborough, &#145;More memories&#146;, 89)</blockquote>In 1881 a reporter for the <span class="italic">Sporting Mirror</span> accused Pickersgill of acting in an unsportsmanlike manner in managing his horses. He castigated the bookmaker for withdrawing his well-fancied horse, Dominic, from the Ebor handicap at York at five o'clock on the afternoon before the race.<br>
<br>Wearying of such criticism and of the cost of owning horses, Pickersgill concentrated on his bookmaking activities. He was very successful and invested much of his profits in property and other businesses, founding the firm of Chorley and Pickersgill Ltd, printers and lithographers. A racing writer described Pickersgill as &#145;a very quiet, even cultured man&#146; who &#145;possessed a personality and all the instincts of a gentleman&#146;  (Fairfax-Blakeborough, &#145;Memories&#146;, 105). Nothing is known about his wife, but Pickersgill's will stipulated that &#145;his son should never have any connection with the Turf or have a bet&#146;  (Hodgson, 3). Pickersgill died on 23 August 1920 at Bardon Hill, Weetwood, Leeds, aged seventy. His death certificate described him as a turf commission agent.<br>
