<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith,  George Charles  Moore</span>  (1858&#150;1940), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 3 September 1858 at Whittlesey in the Isle of Ely, the eldest child of George Moore Smith (<i>d</i>. 1870), a solicitor in Whittlesey, and his wife, Elizabeth, only child of the Revd James Clarke Franks, vicar of Huddersfield. His great-uncle was Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith (1787&#150;1860) and his maternal grandmother was Elizabeth Firth, godmother to two of the Bront&euml; children.<br>
<br>Moore Smith attended a preparatory school in Dalston, London, from 1868 until 1870, when his father died. The family then moved to Tonbridge, where he and his brothers attended Tonbridge School as day boys. The two headmasters during his time there were both former fellows of St John's College, Cambridge, and it was to this college that Moore Smith proceeded in 1877. He matriculated as an exhibitioner, then held a foundation scholarship from 1880 to 1884, which enabled him to continue his studies after he graduated with a first class in the classical tripos in 1881. He used this opportunity to study English language under W. W. Skeat. There followed a long period of uncertainty in his career before he moved to Sheffield in 1896. He spent some time teaching and studying in Europe, making many friends among German and Danish scholars. His life continued to revolve around Cambridge, however, and he was disappointed that he was never able to obtain a permanent situation there (he was eventually made an honorary fellow of St John's College in 1933). He played a leading part in raising support in Cambridge for the Toynbee Hall settlement in London, and from 1885 onwards he did some work as a Cambridge University extension lecturer, first in Norwich, and later in Northampton and St Albans.<br>
<br>Moore Smith arrived in Sheffield at an important moment in the development of higher education in the city. His first appointment, in 1896, was as professor of English language and literature at Firth College (opened in 1880). But the following year Firth College combined with the technical and medical schools to become University College, Sheffield, and in 1905 this college received its charter as the University of Sheffield. Moore Smith retained his post and played a vital part in building up the social and academic status of the new institution. As honorary librarian from 1896 to 1907 he was responsible for developing its library holdings to more than 10,000 books, many obtained as gifts or legacies through his many contacts. He also founded and edited the magazine <span class="italic">Floreamus</span>, which solemnly chronicled the affairs of the college and university. His own scholarly publications increased steadily after his appointment, and he came to be regarded as one of the most eminent scholars in the new university. Family connections led him for a while into military history: the relief of Ladysmith (a town named after his great-aunt, Lady Juana Smith) prompted him to edit <span class="italic">The Autobiography of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith</span> (1901) and the success of this book, which was reprinted several times, led on to <span class="italic">The Life of John Colborne, Field-Marshal Lord Seaton</span> (1903). But Moore Smith's real interests lay in literary history, particularly in the work of authors who, like himself, had received a classical training at Cambridge. He made a special study of the Latin plays written and performed by Cambridge scholars in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and produced scholarly editions of <span class="italic">Pedantius</span> (1905), <span class="italic">Victoria</span> (1906), <span class="italic">Club Law</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Hymenaeus</span> (1908), <span class="italic">Fucus histriomastix</span> (1909), and <span class="italic">Laelia</span> (1910), together with a companion volume, <span class="italic">College Plays Performed in the University of Cambridge</span> (1923). His other major scholarly works included editions of <span class="italic">Gabriel Harvey's Marginalia</span> (1913), <span class="italic">The Poems, English and Latin, of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">The Letters of Dorothy Osborne to Sir William Temple</span> (1928). He received a LittD from Cambridge in 1907 and honorary doctorates from the universities of Louvain and St Andrews, as well as from Sheffield. He retired in 1924 and on his seventieth birthday was presented with <span class="italic">A Bibliography of the Writings of G. C. Moore Smith</span>, which listed more than 300 published items. It is a striking feature of Moore Smith's career that hardly any of these items were substantial monographs: even the books he had largely written, like <span class="italic">The Life of John Colborne</span>, were officially only &#145;compiled&#146; by him. He evidently preferred the role of scholarly editor or glossator to that of critic or author. In this respect, although he was very much formed by Cambridge, Moore Smith's approach to the study of literature was quite antithetical to that of the later &#145;Cambridge English&#146; tradition. His tastes were uncritically those of Victorian Romanticism and his practice, both as teacher and scholar, was modelled on his early success in classics.<br>
<br>Moore Smith departed from his usual topics to produce <span class="italic">The Story of the People's College, Sheffield, 1842&#150;1878</span> (1912). He was committed to the &#145;civic&#146; mission of the university in Sheffield, and so served on several local educational committees, and gave many public lectures. He continued to live in Sheffield after his retirement, but suffered increasingly from arthritis, and died at home on 7 November 1940 from injuries sustained after a fall in his room. After a funeral at St Augustine's Church, he was buried on 9 November in the Sheffield general cemetery, less than a mile from his home at 31 Endcliffe Rise Road which, as a lifelong bachelor, he had shared with his surviving sisters.<br>
