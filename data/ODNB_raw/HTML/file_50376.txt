<span class="headword">Salter,  Alfred</span>  (1873&#150;1945), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and politician</span>, was born at 23 South Street, Greenwich on 16 June 1873, the son of Walter Hookway Salter and Elizabeth Jester. His father was an administrative officer with the Metropolitan Gas Company. Salter's childhood and adolescence were economically secure; his family's growing prosperity was indicated by a move to Lewisham Hill. His early experiences were also deeply religious. Initially the family were Wesleyans but later joined the Plymouth Brethren. At the age of nine Salter joined the Band of Hope; his commitment to temperance would be lifelong. Educated at the Roan School in Greenwich, Salter became a medical student at Guy's Hospital in 1889. His student career was outstanding. In 1895 he took triple first-class honours in the MB and was awarded the gold medal. The following year he came first in the MD examination and again took the gold medal. In 1897 he became house physician and resident obstetric physician at Guy's, and Joseph Lister appointed him bacteriologist to the British Institute of Preventive Medicine. His talent was apparent in a range of research papers published in British and German journals. He seemed destined for a prestigious and lucrative career.<br>
<br>Salter's strong ethical sense drove his career in a very different direction. During his student years he had been attracted to socialism and had joined the Social Democratic Federation. This had been accompanied by a shift to agnosticism. As a student he had also visited homes in working-class Bermondsey. The poverty in this south-eastern London riverside borough had left a lasting impression. In 1898 he went to live in the Bermondsey settlement, a centre for social service with a strongly Christian ethos. His evenings were spent organizing activities for the settlement's programme.<br>
<br>The most decisive influence on Salter came from Ada Brown (1866&#150;1942), the daughter of a comfortably-off family in Raunds, Northamptonshire [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38531/', "Salter, Ada")</script>]. She lived in Bermondsey and ran the girls' club at the settlement. Her involvement was inspired by a blend of religious zeal and social concern. Together with the settlement's head, the Revd John Scott Lidgett, she brought Salter back to Christianity. They were married on 22 August 1900; both joined the Peckham meeting of the Society of Friends. They decided to devote their lives to the people of Bermondsey, where Salter established a general medical practice which provided the core of his identity within the community. Driven by his sense of mission, Salter worked prodigiously long hours. His political activities, influenced by Scott Lidgett, became focused on the Liberal Party, which seemed congenial to his religious and ethical beliefs. He was elected to the Bermondsey borough council in 1903, and two years later became a member of the Progressives on the London county council (LCC). But his discontent with the Liberals grew. On 5 May 1908 he was one of a small group that formed the Bermondsey branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP).<br>
<br>The party was relatively weak in London. Working-class Liberalism was strong and socialists tended to join the Social Democratic Federation. Yet the ethical style of the ILP was obviously attractive to Salter. The initial membership included two other partners in his practice and some working-class activists. In October 1909 the branch faced its first serious test. Bermondsey's Liberal member died and Salter contested the by-election. The ILP depended heavily on Salter's local reputation as a doctor; Liberals responded that a vote for him was a wasted vote. Especially in the context of the deepening crisis over the people's budget and the Lords, this was a powerful weapon. Salter finished bottom with 1435 votes. Subsequent socialist growth in Bermondsey was slow. Neither general election was fought in 1910; Salter, fighting for his new party, lost his LCC seat. When the ILP ran a slate in the borough elections, only Ada Salter was successful. Salter's austere and principled politics was complemented by an immense capacity for organizational work. He and his colleagues courted trade-union branches to build Bermondsey Labour Party; on a wider canvass he was heavily involved in the creation of the London Labour Party. His activism was accompanied and perhaps heightened by a personal tragedy. Alfred and Ada Salter's only child, Joyce, had died in 1910, a victim of scarlet fever in a borough where child mortality rates were appallingly high.<br>
<br>Salter's response to the outbreak of the First World War was based on his interpretation of Christianity. His &#145;Faith of a pacifist&#146; was unequivocal: &#145;I believe that all killing is murder and is wrong&#146;  (<span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, 24 Sept 1914). He participated vigorously in the anti-war propaganda of the ILP and played a significant role in the No-Conscription Fellowship. At wartime ILP conferences Salter repeatedly moved a resolution pledging the ILP to press the Socialist International to oppose any future war. Sidelined in 1915, passed but ignored by the party leadership the following year, the proposal was adopted firmly as party policy at the 1917 conference. In moving the resolution Salter emphasized a principle that shaped his political choices: &#145;There is no greater fallacy than to think that you can secure good results by using bad means&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent Labour Party Conference Report 1917</span>, 56).<br>
<br>Labour's electoral progress in post-war London was at first uncertain. Salter predictably polled poorly in the new Bermondsey West seat in 1918, but four years later, in November 1922, he entered the Commons, aided by the division of the anti-Labour vote between three candidates. The fragility of his position was clear in December 1923, when he lost to a Liberal in a straight fight. But in the 1924 election Salter won the seat back and retained it until he retired in 1945. By the mid-1920s Bermondsey was a solidly Labour borough at every level, parliamentary, LCC, borough council, and the board of guardians. The local Labour Party was well organized, and the ILP branch was the centre of the labour movement's social activities. The Labour majority on the borough council pioneered an ambitious programme of housing construction, environmental improvements, and welfare provision, of which Salter as an alderman was typically viewed as the principal inspiration.<br>
<br>In parliament Salter was characteristically assiduous in dealing with constituents' problems. His pacifism strengthened his commitment to parliament as the only instrument for a better society. But his austere and often inflexible principles made him an outsider. One of his early Commons interventions was in support of a bill to introduce prohibition. In October 1926 he was found guilty of a breach of privilege. He had commented at a temperance meeting on drunkenness in the Commons, and had repeated the claim when the issue was brought before the house. In congenial company Salter could be relaxed and humorous; in the formality of the Commons his style could be bleak. One seasoned observer captured him as &#145;a stern man of granite quality quite unused to the melting mood&#146;  (cited in Brockway, 150).<br>
<br>Salter's attachment to the ILP was shaken by that party's radicalization in the late 1920s. He remained a supporter of MacDonald and was thoroughly hostile to the leadership of James Maxton. Salter took a leading role in the manoeuvres that produced two meetings of the ILP parliamentary group in December 1928. The purpose was to mobilize against the ILP left, but the strategy provoked opposition, not just from supporters of Maxton, but also from many who saw Salter and his allies as needlessly divisive. Nevertheless, Salter's views were endorsed by many within the Bermondsey ILP and the branch strongly opposed the national party's disaffiliation from the Labour Party in 1932.<br>
<br>Within the small post-1931 Parliamentary Labour Party Salter felt unusually comfortable. He admired Lansbury's leadership, and on international issues the party seemed closer to his own position. In the Commons he led effectively for the parliamentary party on a variety of issues. However, the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the Labour Party's debate over sanctions marked the beginning of a deepening political isolation. At the party's conference in 1935 he supported Lansbury's pacifist position. Subsequently he was a leading figure in the parliamentary pacifist group. He remained close to Lansbury as the latter embarked on his crusade for peace. Much of Salter's energy was devoted to the Peace Pledge Union. His pacifism and distaste for the Versailles settlement made him a supporter of appeasement. After the Munich agreement he insisted that &#145;the average German will withdraw his backing from Hitler if we show willingness to be just&#146;  (A. Salter, <span class="italic">Reconciliation</span>, November 1938, 352). Even in Bermondsey Salter could seem isolated. He quarrelled fiercely with the trades council in 1937 over its organization of a counter-demonstration against Sir Oswald Mosley. He told delegates that their behaviour made them indistinguishable from the Fascists. At the end of 1938 his disillusion was severe: &#145;I am very distressed about the moral and spiritual condition of the Labour Party&#146;  (Salter to Arthur Creech Jones, 30 Dec 1938, Creech Jones MSS).<br>
<br>Salter's residual optimism was destroyed by the outbreak of war. His health was deteriorating; his political allies were few; bombs devastated much of Bermondsey. Salter made his last Commons speech in November 1941, a pacifist plea for an armistice. But within two weeks Pearl Harbor would herald a vast extension of hostilities. Ada Salter's death in December 1942 left Salter effectively dependent on his links with the Peace Pledge Union. Yet he and another Labour politician, James Hudson, broke with them not over policy but over the alleged sexual libertarianism of some union employees. He remained a moral absolutist.<br>
<br>Salter died in Guy's Hospital, London, on 24 August 1945 and was buried at Peckham Friends' meeting-house. Bermondsey had been physically and socially battered by the war. His uncompromising pacifism had been rejected by almost all of his former political associates. Yet to many in Bermondsey he remained The Doctor, a man whose medical and municipal achievements far outweighed disagreements with his austere politics.<br>
