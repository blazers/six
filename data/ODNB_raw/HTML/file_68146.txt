<span class="headword">Maitland,  Mary</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1596), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17831/', "Sir Richard Maitland")</script> of Lethington (1496&#150;1586), poet and keeper of the privy seal, and Mary or Mariota Cranstoun (<i>d</i>. 1586). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17826/', "John Maitland")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17838/', "William Maitland")</script> were her brothers. She is conventionally understood as the copyist of the Maitland quarto  (CUL, Pepys 1408), a collection of religious, moral, political, and amatory poems dating from the mid-sixteenth century (including a copy of a poem by James VI and I) and associated with the Maitland family and circle. In comparison with the Maitland folio, its &#145;companion&#146; manuscript, it can in part be regarded as a commonplace book, a celebration or commemoration of the Maitland family, closing with a series of laudatory epitaphs and funerary poems on the death of Maitland's wife. Mary Maitland was considered to have acted as &#145;secretary&#146; to her father, a significant moral and political poet whose work substantially occupies both folio and quarto, and former keeper of the privy seal. On 9 August 1586 she married Alexander Lauder (<i>d</i>. 1622&times;5), son and heir to Sir William Lauder of Hatton. They had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16113/', "George Lauder")</script>, who became a political and military poet (he was the author of <span class="italic">The Scottish Souldier</span>, 1629). She died in 1596, and Alexander Lauder remarried.<br>
<br>The inscription &#145;Mary Maitland 1586&#146;, which appears twice on the manuscript's first folio, suggests the date of its completion (appropriately, the year of her parents' death and of her marriage; there is no reference to the latter). The extent of her role as transcriber is undetermined. On the assumption that the italic hand was traditionally taught to women, it is probable that Mary Maitland was responsible for transcribing the manuscript's poetry in italic as opposed to the other secretary hand in evidence. Maitland's importance as transcriber is substantiated by what appears to be several dedicatory poems which pun on the name &#145;Marie Maitland&#146;, and contain a suggestive symbolism of virginity and female creativity. One lyric, inscribed &#145;To Your Self&#146;, alludes to the promise of fame&#151;the poetic crown of immortality&#151;after the labour of the book's compilation is complete, and implies that Mary Maitland is a poet manqu&eacute;: &#145;a pleasant poet perfyte sall ye be&#146;. The lyric constructs a literary triumvirate of female poets to whom Mary Maitland is implied as a successor. The lyricist's comparison of &#145;Marie&#146; to &#145;sapho saige&#146; seems to endorse the implication of Maitland's own creativity and, in turn, makes more persuasive the case for her actual authorship of several anonymous poems in the quarto, notably one lyric of female homoeroticism, a rare Renaissance poetic example of such desire. A substantial number of secular love poems in the quarto, combined with those written in the female voice, also might suggest Maitland's creative as well as scribal presence. The Maitland quarto is rich in implications regarding women's creative role in manuscript compilation in Renaissance Scotland, and the scope and extent of that expression as dictated by social, moral, and literary orthodoxy.<br>
