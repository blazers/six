<span class="headword">Tomson,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1582&#150;1600), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, may possibly have been the son of Robert Tomson of Andover and Seville, but is more likely to have had his roots in Norfolk. If so, he can probably be identified with Richard Tomson of Yarmouth, nephew of John Thomson of Sheringham, whose mother was from Antwerp and who was engaged for some years in trade with the Mediterranean. In 1582 he was involved in litigation with the Turkey Company. He was part owner of the <i>Jesus of London</i>, which had been confiscated by a merchant rival and taken to Algiers; in 1583 he went there to ransom the prisoners. For four years (1585&#150;9) he was a frequent correspondent with Walsingham. He spoke French and German, wrote in a vivid and fluent prose style, and may have been related to Laurence Tomson, Walsingham's secretary. He was involved in negotiations with Spain (1585&#150;6) for the release of English prisoners in Dunkirk, and told Walsingham of the troop movements of Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma. In January 1588 he was in Flanders, where he was solicited by Spaniards to deliver a large quantity of iron ordnance and cables from England, for which he was promised a monthly pension for life. Knowing that the ordnance was for equipping the projected armada, he refused the offer and informed Walsingham so that he could prevent its export. He later wrote to Burghley that &#145;no true-hearted Englishman will prefer filthy lucre before the public benefit of his country&#146;  (Tomson to Burghley, 3 April 1593 <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1581&#150;1603</i>, ccxliv, 116).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1588 Tomson was lieutenant of the <i>Margaret and John</i>, a merchant ship involved against the armada, and wrote to Walsingham a long report from the Isle of Walcheren (30 July), giving particulars of his encounters with the Spaniards, especially the capture of the galleon of Don Pedro de Valdes during the night after the first battle, and the boarding of the <i>San Lorenzo</i>, which had keeled over in Calais harbour. But for Tomson it would not be known what occurred on the only occasion during the armada's passage when one of the combatants boarded and captured an enemy ship. He occupied her for one and a half hours, finally making off when the robbing of a French deputation provoked a loud protest from the guns of the castle at Calais. He was engaged (1588&#150;9) in a lengthy negotiation with Parma over the ransom terms for the release of armada prisoners, and wrote regularly to Walsingham about this, and the possibility of replacing Spanish authority in Flanders. By 1591&#150;2 he was corresponding with Burghley about the Catholic League's activities in France and Parma's projected march to aid them. He informed Burghley (1592) of Spanish preparations at Ferrol for a new armada against the British Isles.<br>
<br>It is possible that Tomson was the interloper charged by the Barbary Company (1596) with supplying Mawlay Ahmad, king of Morocco, with oars, lances, and firearms, in return for almonds, dates, molasses, and indigo; in vain the company asked Burghley to ban Tomson's imports into England. He traded in partnership with Gilbert Sootherne, who died in Morocco (1599), and protested to Robert Cecil that he was being deprived of his goods in Sootherne's possession, but despite a pressing letter from Elizabeth to the king his goods do not appear to have been released. Tomson is finally discovered writing to Cecil (1599&#150;1600) about contradictory reports of a new Spanish armada and slanderous talk against Cecil which he overheard in a Suffolk inn while <i>en route</i> for his home in Norfolk. He may have been the Captain Tomson with the notorious pirate Peter Eston in 1611&#150;12, but the name is too common to make identification certain.<br>
