<span class="headword">Blount,  Walter</span>, first Baron Mountjoy  (<em>d.</em> 1474), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2695/', "Sir Thomas Blount (c.1383&#150;1456)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2699/', "Blount, Sir Walter (d. 1403)")</script>] and Margaret Gresley, and was probably born at Barton Blount, Derbyshire. Walter and his brother Thomas were in the service of Henry VI in the early 1450s, but by 1454 were associated with Richard, duke of York, and his ally Richard Neville, earl of Warwick. When in May 1454 Nicholas Longford sacked Walter's house at Elvaston as part of a violent feud with the Blounts, the damage included the slashing of a tapestry bearing Blount's arms &#145;for that the said Walter Blount was gone to serve traitors, therefore his arms shall be thus quartered&#146;  (Storey, 154). Blount escaped attainder at the Coventry parliament of November 1459, receiving a pardon for his treasons in December, but his offices were confiscated. During the Yorkist ascendancy after the battle of Northampton he was made treasurer of Calais, where his patron Warwick was captain. In March 1461 he fought on the Yorkist side at Towton. He was made knight of the Bath at Edward IV's coronation, and in June was reappointed treasurer of Calais, a post which he held until November 1464, when he surrendered it to his brother Thomas on being made treasurer of England. On 20 June 1465 he was created Baron Mountjoy. In August 1467 he received two grants of forfeited land in the south-west, perhaps as compensation for yielding the treasurership to the king's father-in-law, Earl Rivers, in the previous year. In September 1468 he indented to lead troops to Brittany for six months to aid the duke of Brittany against Louis XI of France, but the expedition was cancelled, and Blount, who had by then been paid for his retinue, served instead at sea under Anthony, Lord Scales, for rather less than three months and was allowed to pocket the difference, which may have been some compensation for the money he was still owed by the crown for his service at Calais.<br>
<br>Walter Blount's first wife, whom he married in or before 1442, was Ellen, the daughter of Sir John Byron of Clayton, Lancashire. By November 1467 he had married as his second wife Anne, daughter of Ralph, earl of Westmorland, and widow of Humphrey Stafford, duke of Buckingham (<i>d</i>. 1460). Blount died on 1 August 1474 and was buried in the Apostles' Chapel in the Greyfriars Church, London, although he also made major bequests to the church of Elvaston, where his first wife was buried, and to the hospital of St Leonard near Alkmonton, Derbyshire, a family foundation. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_2701"></a><span class="headword">William Blount</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1471), had died at Barnet on 14 April 1471, from wounds received in the battle, after sharing Edward IV's exile. Walter's heir was thus William's son, Edward, whose custody was granted in January 1475 to his stepfather, John Elrington, the treasurer of the king's household, who had married William's widow, Margaret Echingham (<i>d</i>. 1481). Edward died on 1 December 1476 and was succeeded by his uncle, Walter's second son, John, who had licence to enter his father's lands on 15 January 1476, back-dated to 2 January.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_2690"></a><span class="headword">John Blount</span>, third Baron Mountjoy  (<em>d.</em> 1485), was knighted at the marriage of Richard, duke of York, in January 1478. He had been <span class="occ">lieutenant of Hammes</span> since 6 April 1470, but after being made constable of Gu&icirc;nes by Richard III seems to have left Hammes to his younger brother, James, who had been granted the office jointly with him in May 1476. By 14 August 1484 John was seriously ill and Sir Thomas Montgomery (who was later to marry his widow) was authorized to act as his deputy. Blount made his will on 6 October 1485, in which he prayed his sons &#145;to live rightwisely and never to take the state of baron upon them if they may leave it from them, nor to desire to be great about princes for it is dangerous&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 9.338, n. f). He died on 12 October. With his wife, Lora, the daughter of Sir Edward Berkeley of Beverstone, Gloucestershire, he had two sons, William and Rowland, and a daughter, Constantyne, all of whom were under age at his death. In 1488 the wardship of his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2702/', "William Blount")</script>, was granted to his brother James, the third son of Walter, Lord Mountjoy.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_2688"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Blount</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1492), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, had been an esquire of the body of Richard III and as constable of Hammes was gaoler of the imprisoned Lancastrian John de Vere, earl of Oxford. At the beginning of November 1484 Blount freed his prisoner and went with him to join Henry Tudor in France. He accompanied Tudor's invasion of England in 1485 and was knighted by him at his landing at Milford Haven. He was subsequently rewarded with land forfeited by Richard's allies &#145;for services rendered at great bodily risk and expense in favouring the king's title&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1485&#150;94</i>, 230). He married Elizabeth, one of the two daughters and coheirs of John Delves, who died with his father on the Lancastrian side at Tewkesbury. The Delves's land was thereby forfeited, although Edward IV granted Blount their manor of Apedale in Staffordshire in June 1475. Blount was later to find himself in dispute with John Delves's brother Ralph over the descent of other family property. Blount made his will on 24 July 1492, naming the earl of Oxford supervisor, and died on 29 July. He willed burial with his father and brothers in the London Greyfriars.<br>
