</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Orton,  Job</span>  (1717&#150;1783), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and theologian</span>, the elder son of Job Orton (<i>d</i>. 1741) and Mary Perkins (<i>d</i>. 1762), was born on 4 September 1717 in Shrewsbury, where both his father and grandfather were in trade as grocers and where the family owned substantial property. He received his early education at the grammar school in Shrewsbury, where he remained for eight years until May 1733, when he left for Warrington. There he was under the care of Charles Owen, a dissenting minister of considerable learning; his sole fellow pupil was John Ashworth, eldest brother of Caleb Ashworth of Daventry. Orton remained at Warrington for a year, then spent the month of June 1734 with the family of Thomas Colthurst, Presbyterian minister at Whitchurch in Shropshire. Here it appears that Orton resolved to devote himself to the ministry. <br>
<br>Orton entered the academy of Philip Doddridge at Northampton in August 1734, where he rapidly mastered the style of shorthand used by Doddridge and his pupils, and within a few weeks he was able to take down entire sermons. His ability and diligence evidently endeared him to Doddridge, who described him as &#145;<i>omni laude major</i> &hellip; the darling of our congregation&#146; and &#145;perhaps one of the best of preachers and men&#146;  (Nuttall, letters 575 and 663). In March 1739 Doddridge appointed him his assistant at the academy, and he began to lecture in the classics and geography; this position was later supported by a grant from the Coward Trust. He preached his first sermon the following month at Welford, Northamptonshire, and continued to preach regularly in the neighbouring villages and at Doddridge's own church of Castle Hill, Northampton; he was licensed as a minister later the same year. <br>
<br>Orton's talents as a preacher brought him several invitations from dissenting congregations to settle with them as minister. Approaches were made by the nearby congregations at Welford and Rothwell, Northamptonshire, and by Salters' Hall, London, but Doddridge was reluctant to lose the valuable services of his able assistant, and in response to the deacons of Market Harborough in October 1740 wrote that he would not oppose the church's invitation, but neither could he support it. Eventually a vacancy arose in April 1741 through the death of Charles Berry, the minister of a Presbyterian meeting in Shrewsbury. At about the same time the smaller King's Head Independent society, which numbered among its members Orton's mother and father, also lost its pastor, John Dobson, who moved to Walsall. Thus a joint invitation from the united Presbyterian and Independent congregations presented Orton with an opportunity both to consolidate the new union and to return as minister to his family. In 1777 he wrote to Samuel Palmer, &#145;It was with much regret that I left Northampton. I should like to have lived and died in that post, but for the circumstances of uniting the congregation at Shrewsbury&#146;  (J. Orton, <span class="italic">Letters to Dissenting Ministers</span>, 2 vols., 1806, 2.187, 18 July 1777). Doddridge was resigned to his departure and Orton returned to Shrewsbury, where he preached his first sermon on 18 October 1741; he was ordained the following year. <br>
<br>Within a month of his return, however, Orton's father died. He was greatly affected by the loss, which caused his health to deteriorate; he received treatment from Dr Cheney Hart, and in September 1742 retired to Bath to convalesce. An assistant was sought to ease Orton's burden and Francis Boult was appointed, remaining until the end of 1745, when he moved to Wrexham. Boult was succeeded by Moses Carter, a former student of Orton and Doddridge, but one who had disagreed with Doddridge and incurred his displeasure. Carter was highly regarded in Shrewsbury, but he died suddenly in 1747, and a third assistant, Joseph Fownes, was appointed in 1748. Fownes was to remain a lifelong friend. <br>
<br>In December 1750 Philip Doddridge contracted a severe chill which further aggravated his already consumptive condition. His health continued to decline in 1751, and in July he left Northampton on his final itinerary. Together with his wife he stayed with the devoted Orton in Shrewsbury from 22 July to 21 August before embarking from Falmouth for Lisbon, where he died on 26 October. Orton preached his funeral sermon, &#145;The Christian triumph over death&#146;, on the text of 1 <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> 15: 54, a duty that he regarded as &#145;a signal honour&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, viii). In his will Doddridge bequeathed his personal <span class="roman">Bible</span>, formerly owned by Samuel Clark, to his loyal pupil and friend and appointed him his literary executor. In this capacity Orton first published in 1755 a volume of Doddridge's hymns, which he presented &#145;with a chearful Hope, that they will promote and diffuse a Spirit of Devotion&#146;  (P. Doddridge, <span class="italic">Hyms Founded on Various Texts in the Holy Scripture</span>, 1755, preface, iv). He then oversaw the publication of the final three volumes of Doddridge's <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">Family expositor</span>, which was completed in 1756. <br>
<br>According to the terms of Doddridge's amended will, Caleb Ashworth was appointed his successor at the academy which, thereupon, moved to Daventry. The succession at Castle Hill, however, remained unresolved, and Orton was approached in March 1752 to fill the vacancy. Alarmed at the prospect of losing him, the Shrewsbury congregation sent Orton a unanimous address entreating him to stay, and Orton eventually declined the offer. Other attempts were made to entice him away from Shrewsbury, including an invitation from a large congregation at Westminster seeking a replacement for its recently deceased pastor, Obadiah Hughes. Orton showed no inclination for London, which he never visited, and he refused on the grounds of his health. The vacancy was eventually filled in 1753 by Andrew Kippis, another of Doddridge's pupils and, subsequently, Orton's biographer. <br>
<br>Orton remained at Shrewsbury, seemingly comfortable with the assistance and companionship of Joseph Fownes, and his ministry passed uneventfully. In 1765, however, his health, never robust, had declined to the point where he reluctantly decided to resign his ministry. He preached his final sermon on 15 September 1765, his forty-eighth birthday as he continued to observe it in the new calendar. Shortly after, he completed his <span class="italic">Memoirs of Doddridge</span>, eventually published in 1766, attributing the long delay to &#145;A deep conviction of my own Incapacity for executing it in the most desirable Manner &hellip; my ill State of Health and the necessary Duties of my Station&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Doddridge</span>, xiii). <br>
<br>The appointment of Orton's successor resulted in an unfortunate secession from the church in Shrewsbury, and Orton found it necessary to seek retirement elsewhere. On 26 October 1766 he duly set up house in Kidderminster, where Benjamin Fawcett, a near contemporary and fellow pupil at Northampton, had been minister since 1745. In retirement he settled into the role of dissenters' patriarch. Kippis remarked on Orton's &#145;considerable resemblance, in certain respects, to that famous divine&#146;  (Kippis, 314), referring to Richard Baxter, his great dissenting predecessor at Kidderminster. He became a prolific correspondent and, despite his lack of a formal university education, was offered an honorary DD by New Jersey College in 1773. He declined the honour; however, in later years he styled himself STP (Sanctae Theologiae Professor). <br>
<br>Orton remained in Kidderminster for the rest of his life and was able to devote more attention to his own writings, which before his retirement had been confined to a few sermons and anonymous tracts. In 1769 he published a series of sermons, <span class="italic">Religious Exercises Recommended</span>, followed in 1771 by <span class="italic">Discourses to the Aged</span>, works which, according to Kippis, showed &#145;an earnest desire in the writer to advance the interests of genuine piety and practical religion&#146;  (Kippis, 311). He published three discourses entitled <span class="italic">Christian Worship</span> in 1775, and a further series of sermons, <span class="italic">Discourses on Practical Subjects</span>, the following year. His final work, published in 1777, <span class="italic">Sacramental Meditations</span>, was a series of fifty reflections on the administration of the sacrament as practised by dissenters. <br>
<br>Between 1744 and 1765 Orton had already compiled what would become his greatest work, a commentary on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> that was eventually published posthumously as <span class="italic">A Short and Plain Exposition of the Old Testament</span> in six volumes from 1788 to 1791. Publication was finally overseen by Robert Gentleman, another former student at Daventry academy, Orton's own successor at Shrewsbury, and later Fawcett's replacement at Kidderminster. It was mostly well received; Samuel Palmer, Orton's original choice as editor, thought it &#145;somewhat similar to Dr. Doddridge's <span class="italic">Family Expositor</span>&#146;, and Kippis described it as &#145;calculated for general utility&#146;  (Kippis, 311) and conveying valuable instruction. <br>
<br>Orton's ecumenical appeal and tolerance of the established church are apparent in the volumes of his correspondence that also appeared posthumously, <span class="italic">Letters to a Young Clergyman</span> (1791), addressed to Thomas Stedman, a friend of long standing and vicar of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, and <span class="italic">Letters to Dissenting Ministers</span> (1806), edited by Samuel Palmer. His collected works were eventually published in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Practical Works</span>, in 1842. <br>
<br>During his years at Kidderminster Orton was fortunate to have the services of a very able physician, Dr James Johnstone, whose care evidently alleviated his sufferings but could not halt the continued decline in his health. By 1783 his condition had deteriorated beyond recovery, and he died at Kidderminster on 19 July, in his sixty-sixth year. According to his wishes, he was buried on 25 July in the chancel of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, in the grave of a former vicar, John Bryan, who had been ejected from St Chad's in 1662. Funeral sermons were delivered by Joseph Fownes and Samuel Lucas. However Orton had directed them to make no reference to himself but only &#145;exhibit the glory of the gospel and the honour of the Christian ministry&#146;; the first was published later the same year. <br>
<br>Orton had never married, and after a number of small bequests to his doctor and to fellow dissenting ministers the bulk of his estate passed to his nephews. Appropriately, he left a number of books, including the <span class="roman">Bible</span> bequeathed by Doddridge, to Thomas Robins, another of Doddridge's former pupils, &#145;for the use of the Library belonging to the Academy in Daventry&#146;. <br>
<br>It is not easy to place Orton within the complex context of eighteenth-century dissent. His background was Presbyterian but he thought himself &#145;quite an Independent&#146;. Like his mentor, Doddridge, his view of the Trinity was essentially Sabellian, and, again like Doddridge, his teaching found wide acceptance within other nonconformist traditions and he embraced a large circle of friends and correspondents within both the established and dissenting churches. He evidently regarded his own achievements as something of a disappointment, particularly the period of his ministry at Shrewsbury, although it was almost certainly his perpetual poor health that prevented his being more active. It was as a preacher that he was most successful: Fownes described his style as &#145;practical, serious and affectionate&#146;  (Kippis, 314). <br>
<br>Orton was fiercely protective of what he saw as the traditions of the old dissent. When Lady Huntingdon's preachers came to Kidderminster, he criticized Benjamin Fawcett for encouraging &#145;strolling preachers&#146; and he later berated him for allowing a drum-major of the Northamptonshire militia to preach from his pulpit. He was deeply suspicious of the spread of Methodism and saw Methodist preachers &#145;propagating their Antinomian notions&#146; as a threat. Baptists, he considered, had also done much injury. <br>
<br>Although a distinguished minister and theologian in his own right, Orton made no great contribution to nonconformist theology and is now chiefly remembered through his association with Philip Doddridge, first as pupil and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, later as assistant, and finally as biographer and literary editor.<br>
