<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baker,  Harold Brooks  Brooks-</span>  (1933&#150;2005), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born Harold Brooks Baker in Washington, DC, USA, on 16 November 1933, the son of Charles Silas Baker (1888&#150;1943), head of the law firm of Baker, Beedy, and Magee, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lambert. As a child he contracted polio and nearly died; he never recovered from the physical effects of his illness, and in his final years was confined to a wheelchair. For two years he languished in a sanatorium in Georgia, reading novels and day-dreaming; and his susceptibility to titled society perhaps dated from this time. At the age of fifteen he resumed his interrupted education, and entered Trinity College, a private school at Hartford, Connecticut; afterwards he studied at the University of Virginia law school. He is said to have been a press officer in the White House during the Eisenhower presidency. He worked as a foreign correspondent of the <span class="italic">Washington Observer</span> in 1960&#150;63, and then as a bond dealer in Paris and Geneva for six years. In 1964 he married Irene Marie, daughter of Count Robert Elliott Le Gras du Luart de Montsaulnin and his wife, Elisabeth de la Rochefoucauld&#151;a marriage that gave him the gratification of a connection with such exclusive French families as Polignac, de Luynes, and Murat. There were two daughters of this marriage. He adopted the surname of Brooks-Baker to circumvent the French laws of birth registration, which prevented him from bestowing the family name of Brooks as his daughters' middle forename.<br>
<br>Brooks-Baker came to London in 1976 as managing director of Debrett's Peerage Ltd, which had recently been acquired by new owners. Under his direction the firm published a lucrative series of books on etiquette, manners, and protocol, notably Douglas Sutherland's <span class="italic">The English Gentleman</span> (1978) and <span class="italic">The English Gentleman's Wife</span> (1979). Brooks-Baker oversaw the launch in 1981 of <span class="italic">Debrett's Handbook</span>, a new biographical dictionary to rival <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, retitled <span class="italic">Debrett's Distinguished People of Today</span> from 1988. His office's affairs fell into disarray, and insolvency was only averted by the timely publication of a book marking the marriage of the prince of Wales in 1981. The London Trust Company bought a 75 per cent holding in <span class="italic">Debrett's</span> at this time, and installed Ian McCorquodale as chairman of its subsidiary. Shortly afterwards Brooks-Baker was locked out of the office, and his dismissal was confirmed at a stormy board meeting on 9 November 1981, at which his cause was championed by the quixotic figure of Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that ilk.<br>
<br>In 1984 Ravensdale Securities bought the company that published <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span>, a rival of <span class="italic">Debrett's</span>, which could not however meet its debts to the Inland Revenue and was wound up in 1985&#150;6. It would have been sensible to merge the two competing reference books, but instead, during this period of financial vulnerability, Brooks-Baker acquired the right to publish spin-off books under the <span class="italic">Burke's</span> imprint. But he had nothing to do with compiling or publishing <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span>, of which no new edition was published between 1970 and 1999. Instead his flair for publicity and self-advertisement was put to the service of an enterprise that published books on history and manners, and which undertook remunerative work as genealogical researchers for clients in Britain, North America, and Australasia. Subsequently he acted as a middleman who enabled his clients to buy Scottish feudal baronies at prices reportedly exceeding &pound;50,000. These were not titles of honour, but dignities tied to specific lands, carrying powers and responsibilities over the property to which they were attached, and rather less empty than manorial lordships in England. Holders of Scottish feudal baronies were entitled to an armorial grant by the lord Lyon king of arms in Edinburgh. These dealings were exempt from the <span class="roman">Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act</span> of 1925, although the Scottish parliament's <span class="roman">Abolition of Feudal Tenure Act</span> of 2004 stripped feudal baronies of their powers and reduced them to mere titles of dignity, which could be bought and sold without any land. Brooks-Baker and his associates also designed and sold bogus coats-of-arms: bona fide heralds of the College of Arms held his activities in contempt. He was companionable, but had a reputation for being unreliable in money matters, and some of those who had business dealings with him were left smarting. People nicknamed him Brookie to his face, and Crooks-Faker behind his back.<br>
<br>It was chiefly as a &#145;rentaquote&#146; that Brooks-Baker reached prominence. In the 1980s he became a self-appointed arbiter of the habits and conduct of the British royal family and nobility. He was always ready with a pithy and provocative comment for journalists, and indeed issued bombastic public statements before being approached by newspapers. His opinions carried a spurious air of authority because of his association with <span class="italic">Burke's</span>, but were generally glib, ill-informed, smug, and malicious, and part of the culture of irresponsible, inaccurate, and defamatory comment on the house of Windsor that became so prevalent in the 1980s. There seemed no limit to his effrontery. Some senior journalists tried to inhibit the publication of his pronouncements, but they were usually foiled by lazy or ill-informed younger reporters, who found his quotes readily available and reliably catchy.<br>
<br>His first marriage having ended in divorce, Brooks-Baker married secondly, in 1997, Catherine Mary Neville-Rolfe (<i>b</i>. 1947), writer, and daughter of Edmund Neville-Rolfe, agricultural economist and later an artist. His health failed after a fall in the autumn of 2004, and in his final years he suffered from post-polio syndrome. He died on 5 March 2005 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, of heart and respiratory failure. He was survived by his second wife, Catherine, and the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
