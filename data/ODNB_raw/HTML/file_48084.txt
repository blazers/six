<span class="headword">Nevile, Sir  Sydney Oswald</span>  (1873&#150;1969), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born on 12 July 1873, at 2 Gordon Houses, Scarborough, the thirteenth of the fifteen children of the Revd Christopher Nevile (1806&#150;1877), landowner, and rector of Wickenby, in Lincolnshire, and his wife, Mary Anne, daughter of Robert Tooth, brewer and hop grower of Swift's Park, Cranbrook, Kent. The Neviles were a well-connected family with large estates, but Christopher Nevile's death in 1877, when Sydney was four, produced financial problems which restricted his education to the somewhat sporadic tuition of Mr Travers's Preparatory School in Bognor. His mother decided on a brewing pupillage for him, since her brothers had done well in Australia, establishing a major brewery, Tooth's of Sydney. In January 1888 Sydney became an articled pupil at Ebenezer Robins &amp; Son's Hove brewery, paying &pound;100 a year. After two years he joined a larger concern, Brandon's Putney brewery, in London, for a further six months' pupillage. In July 1890, when only seventeen, he was appointed assistant brewer there to T. K. Amos, with a salary of &pound;100 a year.<br>
<br>Nevile's precocity in a conservative industry was further demonstrated when, on Amos's premature death in 1896, he became Brandon's head brewer at the age of twenty-two. He was probably the youngest in such a post in the country. Brandon's quickly expanded, mainly through the free trade, and Nevile took the eye as a promising London brewer with a wider vision than most. It was no surprise when he left the company in 1919 to become a managing director of Whitbread &amp; Co., a much larger and more prestigious company. By that time he had become a nationally known figure in the trade, advocating moderation in drinking and the introduction of improved public houses as the best way to ward off the temperance lobby.<br>
<br>It was during the two world wars that Nevile was at his most influential. In the First World War he often acted as one of the industry's representatives in negotiations with the government. He became a member of the central control board (liquor traffic) from 1917 to 1921. This was Lloyd George's substitute for brewing nationalization, where, despite overt opposition from several quarters in the industry, Nevile adopted a positive response, advising on brewing at Carlisle (where the brewery was state-owned), and ensuring that his enthusiasm for improved pubs was turned into reality. His role in nationalized brewing was a long-term one, since he served on the council of state management districts until 1955. He was also a member of the Hop Control Committee, 1917&#150;23, and an influence on the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1921. President of the Brewers' Society in 1938&#150;40, he used his earlier experience to good effect in the Second World War, producing a more harmonious relationship with government, while protecting brewing interests large and small. He was chairman of the brewing advisory committee appointed by the Ministry of Food, 1940&#150;46, where he gave clear and authoritative advice on fuel and transport economies. He also played a full part in post-war reconstruction, serving on the Morris committee on war-damaged licensed premises, 1942&#150;4. He was knighted in 1942, and in 1946 married Madeleine de Lacy, daughter of Dr C. A. Wickham, of Willesborough, Kent.<br>
<br>At Whitbread, Nevile was for three decades the only director to be recruited from outside the families of the old partnership. He was also one of the company's longest-serving directors, acting as a managing director until 1946 and as an ordinary director until 1968. By orchestrating important mergers in the inter-war years, he was a key figure in Whitbread's emergence as a national brewer. The development of the company's beer brands, marketing, and retailing were particular interests. He helped to establish the Improved Public House Company, a subsidiary which managed Whitbread's large improved pubs in the London area. He also encouraged the company to spend more on advertising. Indeed, his ideas were taken to a national stage when he promoted the Brewers' Society's collective advertising campaign of 1933, based on the themes &#145;Beer is best&#146; and &#145;Beer&#151;the best long drink in the world&#146;. He spent his later years pressing for better training for licensees. Nevile's many positions in the brewing industry included the posts of president of the Institute of Brewing (1919&#150;21), master of the Brewers' Company (1929&#150;30), and chairman of the National Trade Defence (subsequently Development) Association (1946&#150;8). He also gave evidence to the royal commission on licensing of 1929&#150;31. Outside the industry, he was a council member of the Federation of British Industries, 1922&#150;58, and vice-president in 1958.<br>
<br>Sir Sydney Nevile combined a disarming conviviality and wit with tremendous energy and a shrewd business brain. He was also a keen oarsman, and later an enthusiastic yachtsman. The initiator of a new era of &#145;responsible drinking&#146;, he was one of the most influential brewers of the twentieth century. He died at his home, 9 Mill Road, Worthing, on 3 September 1969, survived by his wife.<br>
