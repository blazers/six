<span class="headword">Lloyd <span class="st"> [Floyd]</span>,  John</span>  (1643/4&#150;1682), <span class="occ">poet</span>, born in Wonston, near Winchester, Hampshire, was the son of George Lloyd, or Floyd (1597/8&#150;1658?), rector of Wonston, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16850/', "Nicholas Lloyd (1630?&#150;1680)")</script>. His family was of Welsh origin and besides Nicholas he had two other brothers (George and Edward) and three sisters. Three of his siblings died before him and it appears that his brother Nicholas only just managed to survive the smallpox which was raging while John was a student at Oxford.<br>
<br>Lloyd entered Wadham College, Oxford (under the name Floyd), on 13 November 1662 aged eighteen, was fully admitted on 30 September 1663, received his BA in 1666, and graduated MA on 18 February 1669. On 20 May 1675 he was appointed vicar of Holyrood, Southampton.<br>
<br>Despite his being ordained, Lloyd's real calling seems to have been poetry and music and he is reported to have &#145;shared the friendship and esteem of Addison&#146;  (Rose, 297). Lloyd achieved modest fame with his translation of <span class="italic">The Song of Songs</span>, which first appeared in 1681 in an allegedly plagiarized version. Apparently the author at first did not want the translation to be published: as Lloyd informs his readers in a foreword, the work was handed to a friend in London privately and was &#145;not intended to trouble the press&#146;, but was rather mysteriously &#145;borrowed &hellip; by a stranger, and printed without my leave &hellip; and not only so, but owned by that same person &hellip; for a thing of his own composure&#146;  (Lloyd, <span class="italic">Shir ha shirim, or, The Song of Songs; being a Paraphrase upon the most Excellent Canticles of Solomon in a Pindarick Poem</span>, 1682). This affront induced Lloyd to set matters right and the volume was published in 1682 under its proper author's name with a dedication to Lady Ann Newland, wife of Sir Benjamin Newland. There are several dedications to the author, including one signed &#145;Thomas Butler A.M.&#146; as well as one by the author's brother George. The second edition of 1682 comprises Lloyd's translation <span class="italic">The Hymn on the Works of the Six Days</span>, dated 1681. This seems to be the only other work Lloyd ever published. He died at Southampton on 31 August 1682.<br>
