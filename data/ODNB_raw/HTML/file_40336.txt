<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Thomas Joseph Douglas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Fionn Mac Colla]</span>  (1906&#150;1975), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 4 March 1906 at 9 White's Place, Montrose, the younger of the two children of Donald MacDonald, shoemaker, and his wife, Jessie Anderson Douglas. The family were Plymouth Brethren, and in accordance with their beliefs MacDonald was not baptized as an infant; he was later to react strongly against the Calvinist theological background which dominated his childhood experience. His father was a Gaelic speaker from Inverness, and in adult life MacDonald came to espouse passionately the cause of the Gaelic language; his mother was a native of north-east Scotland.<br>
<br>MacDonald's early years were spent in Montrose with his parents and elder sister, Elizabeth; he was educated at Montrose Academy (<i>c</i>.1917&#150;1923) and Aberdeen Teacher Training College (1923&#150;5), coming out first in Scotland in his final examination. In his youth he became friendly with the great Scottish poet C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid), a near neighbour in Links Avenue, Montrose, whose Scottish nationalist convictions he shared, and who was to offer great encouragement to the literary aspirations of the precociously talented young man.<br>
<br>At the early age of nineteen MacDonald took up his first appointment as headmaster of Laide public school in the district of Gairloch in Ross-shire. Here he was deeply affected by the legacy of the highland clearances and by what he saw as the life-denying assaults of highland Calvinism on the Gaelic language and culture. His anger was later to find a devastating satirical outlet in his first novel, <span class="italic">The Albannach</span> (1932), the story of the frustrations (eventually in part overcome) of a young contemporary highlander. For this novel he adopted the pseudonym Fionn Mac Colla, which was retained for the remainder of his writing career.<br>
<br>In 1926 MacDonald left Scotland to teach for three years at the United Free Church of Scotland's college at Safed in Palestine. One of the subjects he taught was history, and while teaching it he was by his own account powerfully struck by &#145;two marks of historical Catholicism&#151;its conception of man's Unity and its faculty of self-renewal&#146;  (Mac Colla, <span class="italic">Too Long in this Condition</span>, 77). On his return from Palestine he made contacts in the predominantly Roman Catholic parts of the Outer Hebrides, and it was a priest at Iochdar in South Uist who introduced him to the works of Jacques Maritain and to Thomist philosophy, an influence which (together with his passion for the classics of Russian literature) was to prove decisive in the formation of both his peculiar cast of mind and his means of expression.<br>
<br>In 1929 MacDonald returned to Scotland to devote himself to the Scottish movement (the National Party of Scotland had been formed the previous year), and to writing. For a year he studied Gaelic at Glasgow University, but was forced to give up through lack of funds. In 1930 he moved to Edinburgh to work on the journal the <span class="italic">Free Man</span>, and later was for a time employed as a literary adviser by the New University Society; but the 1930s were years of sporadic employment and great economic hardship. Hugh MacDiarmid arranged for the publication of <span class="italic">The Albannach</span> by the firm of John Heritage, of which he was a director, and praised the novel in print both uncompromisingly and acutely. During the years 1934&#150;8 MacDonald was working on his second book, <span class="italic">And the Cock Crew</span>, perhaps his masterpiece, a classic novel of the highland clearances notable for its grandeur of language and conception and its acute psychological and socio-historical insights. Hopes of early publication were dashed by the outbreak of the Second World War, and the novel did not appear until 1945. Regarded by Hugh MacDiarmid as by far the most radical products of the Scottish Renaissance movement in the field of fiction, these two novels failed however to reach a wide public and remained the only two of MacDonald's works of fiction to be published in their entirety during his lifetime.<br>
<br>MacDonald was received into the Roman Catholic church at Dundee on 31 December 1935, and shortly thereafter, on 24 January 1936, he married Mary Doyle (1911&#150;1999) at St Peter's and St Paul's Roman Catholic Church, Dundee. They were to raise a family of ten children (three sons and seven daughters). Determined to bring up his family in a Catholic and Gaelic-speaking environment, MacDonald moved in January 1941 to the Western Isles as headmaster of Torlum School on Benbecula, transferring to a similar post on the island of Barra in 1946. In all he spent nearly twenty years in the Gaidhealtachd, years which he was later to describe as &#145;a never-ending horror of totally schizoid activity&#146;  (Mac Colla, &#145;Mein bumpf&#146;), for he felt that the exigencies of his position had forced him against his will to participate in the de-Gaelicization of his pupils and to strangle his own creative and speculative talent.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, MacDonald continued to write. His major effort during these years was a historical novel which attempted to penetrate to the root causes of the Reformation within the human soul, and to address once again the profound interrelatedness of the three developments with which he was preoccupied all his writing life: the loss of Scottish nationhood, the decline of the Gaelic language, and the ascendancy in Scotland of Reformation protestantism. Uncompromising in theme and approach, and making few concessions to the ordinary reader (much of the dialogue reflects sixteenth-century Scots usage), <span class="italic">Move up, John</span> failed to find a publisher, and a pattern of rejection and frustration was established which was to dog MacDonald for the rest of his career. Fragments were issued separately as <span class="italic">Scottish No&euml;l</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">Ane Tryall of Heretiks</span> (1962); the complete novel was published posthumously only in 1994. Another novel from these years, a little more optimistic in outlook, depicts with acerbic psychological observation what happens in a west highland parish when the minister starts having mystical experiences; it was published as <span class="italic">The Ministers</span> in 1979, four years after the author's death. In the 1950s he wrote one more novel, &#145;Facing the Muzhik&#146; (still unpublished; National Library of Scotland, deposit 265), which, using the framework of an adventure story in the manner of John Buchan, addresses questions about the political and social development of Russia in terms of its religious history; but it too failed to find an outlet.<br>
<br>In 1960 MacDonald left the Western Isles to settle in Edinburgh, where he taught until his retirement in 1967, living first at 40A Morningside Park and latterly, when most of his children had left home, at 51 Warrender Park Road. By this time he had abandoned any real hope of the publication of his later fiction. He did, however, publish a brilliant exposition of his philosophical ideas in <span class="italic">At the Sign of the Clenched Fist</span> (1967), and made a final attempt to propagate his religious and political convictions in the form of a lively, idiosyncratic, and opinionated autobiographical work, <span class="italic">Too Long in this Condition</span>, which appeared in 1975 about a month after his death.<br>
<br>As a personality, Tom MacDonald was complex and arresting. With a tall and distinguished physical presence and impressive facial features, he had latterly much of the look of an <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophet; and the prophet, too, was an essential ingredient of his temperament. Ebullient and witty when in good form, and a brilliant talker and anecdotalist, he could also be moody, depressed, touchy, and difficult to deal with. In his later years he was undoubtedly an embittered and frustrated man, and not without reason. As well as the three novels which remained unpublished at the time of his death, he left manuscripts of an account of the Russian prison system under the tsars, entitled &#145;The tsars' white hell&#146; and dating from the early 1950s, and an untitled continuation of his autobiography. He was stung equally by the lack of any general recognition of his achievements as a writer (though his work was often highly praised by perceptive commentators), and by what he saw as his failure to communicate to a wide public the urgency of the ideas which he so vehemently advocated. He continued committed to the end, however, taking, for instance, an active part in the upsurge of Scottish nationalist politics of the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br>
<br>MacDonald died of heart failure in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 20 July 1975. He was cremated at Mortonhall crematorium, and his ashes were buried at Mount Vernon cemetery, Edinburgh, on 24 July 1975. His wife survived him. After his death MacDonald's reputation grew steadily if unspectacularly, and with the publication of two of his later novels it became possible to attempt a more accurate assessment of his work as a whole. It is undoubtedly true that the achievement of his full potential as a novelist was frustrated by the conflict between what he distinguished as the &#145;creative&#146; and &#145;speculative&#146; sides of his talent: his great novelistic gifts never quite overcame his penchant for abstract philosophical analysis, so that, especially in his later fiction, the ideas were imperfectly integrated into the overall structure of the novels. Yet he was a born writer with a strong and subtle intellect, whose powers of precise and telling expression exactly matched his capacity for physical and psychological observation. In spite of structural imperfections his works have a linguistic power and a largeness of conception which succeed in imparting an acute and original vision of the forces which have shaped Scottish reality, both historical and contemporary.<br>
