<span class="headword">Dickinson,  William</span>  (1746/7?&#150;1823), <span class="occ">engraver and printseller</span>, is said to have been born in London; he might possibly have been the son of Joseph and Grace Dickinson, baptized at St Mary, Whitechapel, Stepney, on 6 May 1747. It is not known who taught Dickinson to engrave, but in 1767 he was awarded a premium for mezzotint by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. His later training was almost certainly given by the painter Robert Edge Pine, at whose house in St Martin's Lane he lodged between 1768 and 1771. His first eight exhibited drawings and prints (1768&#150;73) were after paintings by Pine; his portrait of Sir Joseph Banks (1774) was the first of twenty-two mezzotints after Reynolds. Dickinson produced in all some hundred portraits, judged &#145;well drawn and finely scraped &hellip; their brilliance often enhanced by the use of warm brown inks&#146;  (Alexander, 863).<br>
<br>In 1773 Dickinson began to publish his own prints, and in 1778 he took under his wing the engraver Johann Jacobe, who was on a state-sponsored visit from Vienna to perfect his mezzotint technique. It has been suggested that Reynolds arranged for Jacobe to lodge with Dickinson; Reynolds was a major supplier of work to Dickinson, who published a number of his paintings in mezzotint and in stipple. By 1778 Dickinson had entered into partnership with Thomas Watson (1743&#150;1781), another engraver in stipple and mezzotint. About Christmas they took over the established print shop of Walter Shropshire in fashionable New Bond Street, insuring their joint stock for about &pound;2400&#151;a sizeable sum. Their stock of plates was based on modern artists, with Reynolds, Kauffman, Bunbury, Peters, and Gardner featuring prominently. Watson died in 1781 but Dickinson continued to run the business alone. At first he was very successful, and he built up a large and distinguished stock of modern plates. In 1791 he took a new shop at 20 Old Bond Street and was appointed engraver and printseller to the prince of Wales. His bankruptcy in 1793 was presumably attributable principally to the war in Europe rather than to the notoriously unreliable patronage of Prince George, but he was obliged to auction his stock at Christies in 1794, and there was a further sale in 1797. Soon after this he emigrated to France, where he worked as a mezzotint engraver. In Paris he engraved portraits of the king of Saxony in 1811 and of the emperor Napoleon in 1815. He seems to have returned to London after Waterloo and was living at Twickenham from 1817 to 1820, but he is said to have died in Paris in 1823.<br>
