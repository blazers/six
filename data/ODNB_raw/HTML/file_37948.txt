<span class="headword">Selous,  Edmund</span>  (1857&#150;1934), <span class="occ">ornithologist and author</span>, was born on 14 August 1857 in London, at Holgate Lodge, Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, the younger son in the family of two surviving sons and three daughters of Frederick Lokes Slous (or Selous), a wealthy stockbroker, and his third wife, Ann Holgate Sherborn, daughter of John Sherborn. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36013/', "Frederick Courteney Selous")</script>, the hunter and African explorer, and the nephew of the artist Henry Courtney Selous and the dramatist Angiolo Robson Selous. Educated privately, he matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1877 (leaving without a degree); he was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1878 and called to the bar in 1881. After trips to southern Africa and India he practised briefly as a barrister and settled down to the life of a gentleman, pursuing the two great passions of his life: the study of natural history and that of great literature (French, German, and Spanish, all read in the original languages, as well as English). In 1886 he married Fanny, daughter of John Maxwell, publisher, and his wife, the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34962/', "Mary Elizabeth Braddon")</script>. They had a son (Gerald Holgate Selous, diplomat and Arabist) and twin daughters.<br>
<br>A conventional Victorian naturalist at first, Selous developed an aversion to blood sports and to all forms of scientific collecting involving cruelty to animals, against which, as a self-styled &#145;life-loving naturalist&#146;, he campaigned for the rest of his life, earning the enmity of certain important figures in the ornithological establishment of the day. In 1898 he began observing the habits of wild birds in earnest, making detailed notes on the spot; he became a key pioneer (as observer and interpreter) in the ethological study of bird behaviour, introducing the words &#145;bird-watcher&#146; and &#145;bird-watching&#146; into the language and producing a large output of influential scientific papers and books. The latter included <span class="italic">Bird Watching</span> (1901), <span class="italic">The Bird Watcher in the Shetlands</span> (1905), <span class="italic">Bird Life Glimpses</span> (1905), <span class="italic">Realities of Bird Life</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Thought-Transference&#151;or what?&#151;in Birds</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Evolution of Habit in Birds</span> (1933), as well as many essays (mostly in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>), and several other books on popular natural history and for children.<br>
<br>Most of Selous's observations were made within walking or cycling distance of his various homes in England and abroad, but he also visited the Shetlands, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Iceland. Bird display was his speciality and he made a number of seminal studies. He was one of the first to seek evidence in the field for the concept of natural selection held by Charles Darwin, maintaining (then heretically) that a species' behaviour was as characteristic of it as any morphological feature.<br>
<br>Selous also championed the Darwinian idea of sexual selection, once more against the tide of contemporary scientific opinion. He obtained evidence of female choice in two species (the ruff and the black grouse) in which mate-selection is made communally, thus earning the later approbation of the distinguished geneticist Sir R. A. Fisher. Also obsessed by the problem of the co-ordinated flight manoeuvres of flocking birds, Selous sought the explanation in some form of extrasensory facility such as telepathy. Selous went on bird-watching and writing nearly to the end of his life and died at his home in Weymouth, Lydwell, Buxton Road, on 25 March 1934.<br>
