<span class="headword">Penington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Proude]</span>,  Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Mary Springett, Lady Springett]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1623, <em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">Quaker and writer</span>, was born at Goodnestone Court, near Faversham, Kent, and baptized on 13 December 1623 at Canterbury Cathedral. She was the only child and heir of Sir John Proude (<i>d</i>. 1628), an army officer, and his wife, Anne Fagge of Ewell, Kent (<i>d</i>. 1628). Sir John Proude fought for the United Provinces in the service of the prince of Orange and died in 1628 at the battle of Groll, in Guelderland, when Mary was about five. Her mother having died in the same year, Mary went to live with guardians whose identity remains unknown, but whose lack of religious rigour was distasteful to her.<br>
<br>From the age of nine until her marriage about the age of eighteen Mary Proude resided in Kent, in the home of Sir Edward Partridge and his extended family, including his recently widowed sister, Lady Katherine Springett, and her three children, the oldest of whom, Sir William Springett (1621/2&#150;1644), parliamentarian colonel, deputy lieutenant for the county of Kent, and devout puritan, became Mary's first husband in 1642. He was sympathetic with her attraction to puritanism, although both later rejected Independency. Married &#145;without a ring&#146;, they refused to have their only son, John (<i>d</i>. before 1647), baptized  (<span class="italic">Experiences</span>, 78). Removed to London on account of the dangerous uprisings in the Vale of Kent, Mary Springett was heavily pregnant with her daughter, Gulielma Maria (1644&#150;1693), when she undertook a harrowing winter journey to Arundel, Sussex, to visit her husband. Having successfully besieged Arundel Castle, he died from spotted fever in 1644. She refused to have her daughter, born after her husband's death, baptized.<br>
<br>During her widowhood, Mary Springett's spiritual life faltered. Experimenting with and then abandoning different religious &#145;notions&#146;, she also rejected her accustomed &#145;religious exercises&#146;  (<span class="italic">Experiences</span>, 28). Believing in &#145;the Lord and his truth&#146;, yet convinced &#145;that it was not made known to any upon earth&#146;  (ibid., 30), Mary Springett became part of fashionable and irreligious London society; she took up &#145;foolish mirth, carding, dancing, singing, and frequenting of music meetings&#146;, but with a &#145;heart &hellip; constantly sad, and pained beyond expression&#146;  (ibid., 30&#150;31). Visited by vivid and prophetic dreams, she still could not pray nor &#145;call God father&#146;  (ibid., 34).<br>
<br>On 13 May 1654, &#145;being [long] wearied in seeking and not finding&#146;, Mary Springett married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21841/', "Isaac Penington (1616&#150;1679)")</script>, Quaker convert and author of many spiritual tracts, who, like her, sought the &#145;truth&#146; and &#145;refused to be comforted by any appearance of religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Experiences</span>, 38). The couple lived in or near London, although they also had estates at Causham (Caversham) Lodge, near Reading, and at Datchet, in south Buckinghamshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21843/', "John Penington")</script>, their eldest son and heir, was born in 1655 and before his death in 1710 he had produced a number of Quaker tracts and preserved the personal papers of his parents, including Mary Penington's spiritual autobiography. &#145;Convinced&#146; about 1656 through the combined efforts of Thomas Curtis and William Simpson, they were publicly affiliated with the Quakers by 1658. Soon after, Mary and Isaac took up residence at The Grange, near Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, an estate which Isaac's father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21840/', "Alderman Isaac Penington (c.1584&#150;1661)")</script>, had given them at the time of their marriage. Their second son, Isaac, was born about 1656, and their only daughter, Mary, in 1657. The Grange was also the centre of the local Quaker community and a haven for the young Thomas Ellwood, who became the Peningtons' tutor in 1662, and whose father opposed his son's convincement. When The Grange was sequestered around 1665 because of Alderman Penington's involvement in Charles I's execution, Mary and her younger children settled near Isaac, imprisoned at Aylesbury (1665&#150;8), while Gulielma Maria stayed with friends. Some time between 1666 and 1668 Mary and some of her children also boarded at Waltham Abbey School, Essex. About 1658&#150;68 she began her spiritual autobiography, which she completed just before her death; it was published in 1821 as <span class="italic">Some account of circumstances in the life of Mary Penington. From her manuscript, left for her family</span>.<br>
<br>Ostracized on account of their Quakerism, Mary Penington and her husband faced lawsuits in chancery, brought by tenants and relations, all of whom took &#145;advantage&#146; of their Quaker refusal to swear oaths  (<span class="italic">Experiences</span>, 53). Judith Penington, Isaac's sister, used the terms of Mary Penington's marriage settlement in an at least partially successful action (<i>c</i>.1664&#150;<i>c</i>.1667) to gain control over her sister-in-law's lands in Kent. Lawsuits led to the loss of at least one of Mary's estates and all of Isaac's. She retained at least one in Sussex (Worminghurst Hall) and several in Kent, including Westbeer, but sold the latter to purchase Woodside, a farm with a dilapidated house near Amersham, in 1669. Having given birth to William in 1665 and Edward in 1667, she renovated Woodside, which was ideally located so the family could remain part of the Chalfont St Peter Quaker community. She completed the work in 1672&#150;3  (Penney, 13). In addition to raising her children during Isaac's imprisonments (1666&#150;71), Mary Penington participated in Quaker controversies; her letters speak favourably of separate women's meetings, and address factionalism and backsliding. Isaac's death in 1679 prompted her publication of a testimony to his character, one of several which preface his collected works (1681). She also helped defend her own reputation as well as that of her husband against William Rogers's attacks in the <span class="italic">Christian Quaker</span> (1680). In <span class="italic">John Penington's Complaint Against William Rogers</span> (1681) she refutes the charge that she avoided the seizure of her property and thus shunned &#145;suffering&#146; for truth  (M. Penington, &#145;My mother's account&#146;, 11).<br>
<br>To Mary Penington's biographers she is the exemplary wife, mother, and &#145;helpmeet&#146; to her famous husbands, although many also praise the literary skill evident in her manuscript biography of William Springett, <span class="italic">A Letter from me to my Dear Grandchild Springet Pen</span> (1680). Her works are also important &#145;social documents&#146;, which &#145;record the liberating effect that Quakerism had on &hellip; women&#146;  (Blecki, 20), offer an &#145;affecting evocation of a spiritual life lived in inviolable privacy even in the midst of a loving family&#146;  (Burns, 72), and present a record of a woman who embraced &#145;the Friends' imperative to break down the barriers between private spiritual conscience and public life&#146;  (Coleman, 93). Her works were first published in 1821, but fifteen extant manuscript copies (1680&#150;<i>c</i>.1812) testify to the recognition of their spiritual and literary merits in England and America. The Victorian novelist Emma Marshall used a family copy of the manuscripts in her civil war romance <span class="italic">Memories of Troublous Times</span> (1880), which includes Mary Penington herself as a character.<br>
<br>Mary Penington's will, dated 18 July 1680, testifies to her successful stewardship of her estate in the face of the government's religious persecution. After giving enough to each of her younger sons &#145;to bind him to some trade&#146;, as well as an additional &pound;400 when each turned twenty-two, she was able to leave gifts and annuities for friends, relatives, and her younger children totalling about &pound;175. Mary's estates, which she had inherited from her mother and father, went to John  (M. Penington, &#145;Abstract of the will&#146;, 109&#150;12). Mary Penington died of an illness, perhaps triggered by a serious fever in June 1680. A letter from Isaac Penington referring to Mary's journey to London to consult a physician suggests, however, that as early as 1667 she was suffering from some kind of painful internal complaint. She died on 18 September 1682 at Worminghurst Hall, Sussex, a property that was probably a gift from Mary to her daughter, Gulielma Maria, upon her marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21857/', "William Penn")</script>. She is buried beside her husband, Isaac, in the Quaker burial-ground at Jordans, Buckinghamshire.<br>
