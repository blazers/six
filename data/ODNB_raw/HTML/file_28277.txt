<span class="headword">Vigani,  John Francis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Giovanni Francesco Vigani]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1713), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in or near Verona. No record of his early life in the area remains, and there is no evidence of his having a degree or licence or following a regular course of study. However, he did travel extensively in Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and England. As a wandering scholar he studied medicine and pharmacy, and collected plants and minerals. In 1671 he was in Parma, where he saw a quack swallow snake poison. In September 1682 he settled in England, at Newark-on-Trent, but it is likely that he had already been in London for some time. It was probably about this time that Vigani married. He and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1711), later had two daughters, Frances (<i>bap</i>. 22 Jan 1683) and Jane (<i>bap</i>. 7 March 1864).<br>
<br>In 1682, Vigani's <span class="italic">Medulla chemiae</span> was printed in Danzig, bearing an undated dedication to a gentleman from the Low Countries, one Joannes de Waal, &#145;Toparcha in Ankeveen&#146;, whom the author extolled for his generous patronage. The book, being a small collection of chemical processes, contains references to the chemical work of Jean Baptiste van Helmont, Robert Boyle, Sylvius, and Otto Tachenius. Vigani clearly adopted a corpuscular theory of matter and rejected the chemical theory of the three principles (sulphur, mercury, and salt). In 1683 Vigani published the second, enlarged, edition of his work, with the title of <span class="italic">Medulla chymiae</span>, which he dedicated to William, earl of Devon, Philip, earl of Chesterfield, and Thomas, Viscount Fauconberg. Prefixed to the work was a letter to the author signed &#145;T. R.&#146;, possibly the initials of his correspondent Dr Robson. The letter, dated London, 10 September 1682, eulogized Vigani for adhering to Boyle's corpuscular philosophy as well as for ruling out the three principles and the related, obscure terminology. In the preface the author briefly outlined the theoretical foundation to his chemical work: &#145;the world&#146;, he wrote, &#145;is concreted of atoms of various figures, with the innate qualities of motion, figure, magnitude and place&#146;. The remainder of the work deals with the analysis of some substances, such as vitriol, urine, common salt, and nitre, describes the preparation of a number of chemical medicines, and includes three plates, depicting furnaces and vessels, by Vigani and his friend the chemical physician, John Troutbeck. The <span class="italic">Acta Eruditorum</span> for 1684 published a laudatory review of this edition of Vigani's <span class="italic">Medulla</span>, which was subsequently reprinted with additions in 1685, 1693, and 1718. The <span class="italic">Medulla</span> was conceived of as a guide to performing experiments in chemical courses, rather than as a textbook.<br>
<br>Vigani started teaching chemistry in Cambridge in 1682 or 1683, independently of any university or college connection, to apothecaries and medical students, but continued to live in Newark. In a letter to Dr John Covell, master of Christ's College, of 2 August 1692, he wrote that he had been invited to write a treatise on chemistry, the preparation of which he had carried on for several years, but that was never published. From 1696 to 1704 Vigani was associated with St Catharine's College, and from 1704 he lectured in Queens' College cloisters (both chemistry and materia medica), where he had a laboratory with a remarkable number of drugs, which were purchased at the expense of the college. In 1707 Bentley built a laboratory for him at Trinity. Surviving notes of his course of chemistry show that he lectured there from November 1707, and it is likely that he taught regularly for several years. There is, however, no evidence that he was a member of any college in Cambridge. In February 1703 the senate conferred on him the title of honorary professor of chemistry in the University of Cambridge. As no stipend was paid to him, he depended entirely on student fees and opened his lectures to the public. He also had a laboratory in Newark, where he carried on some experiments. His surviving lectures on materia medica and chemical courses cover a wider range of subjects than his published work. In them Vigani did not confine himself with practical instructions, but also made a number of observations on medical and chemical topics. He adhered to the acid/alkali theory and explained fevers as the outcome of an exceeding acidity of human blood.<br>
<br>Vigani's knowledge and skill in chemistry were recognized by his contemporaries. Among his students were William Stukeley, Stephen Hales, and Abraham de la Pryme, the latter of whom described him as &#145;a learned chemist &hellip; but a drunken fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Abraham de la Pryme</span>, Surtees Society publication no. 54, 1870, 24&#150;5). Vigani was one of Newton's few friends in Cambridge. They used to have conversations on chemical subjects, but Newton, who possessed a copy of the 1683 edition of Vigani's <span class="italic">Medulla</span>, broke with him when Vigani told him an improper story about a nun. Vigani corresponded with Robert Boyle in 1682 (two letters from Vigani to Boyle are recorded, but they are no longer extant), and with Roger Cotes in 1708.<br>
<br>Vigani's will was made on 19 July 1712. It was proved in the exchequer court of York by the oath of Frances Phisick, the sole executrix and legatee, on 13 June 1713, and the contents of his laboratory were valued for probate at &pound;20. Vigani died in February 1713 at Newark, where he was buried on 26 February at the church of St Mary Magdalen.<br>
