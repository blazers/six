</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dilke, Sir  Charles Wentworth</span>, second baronet  (1843&#150;1911), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was born in London on 4 September 1843 at 76 Sloane Street, on the edge of Belgravia and Chelsea, which house he was to inherit from his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7646/', "(Charles) Wentworth Dilke, first baronet (1810&#150;1869)")</script>, in 1869, and in which he was to live until his own death forty-two years later. He also inherited enough property, much of it in the form of two literary publications, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, as well as more specialized publications, including the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Agricultural Gazette</span>, to bring him an income of &pound;6000&#150;8000 of mid-Victorian money. The first baronet (created 1862) was one of the commissioners for the Great Exhibition of 1851, and was subsequently regarded, in an age of exhibitions, as an exhibition expert. He was in St Petersburg as British commissioner for a horticultural exhibition when he died. He was also briefly MP for Wallingford. But despite these attributes he was not greatly esteemed by his elder son (who subsequently wrote of him: &#145;brain-power wasted and heart misunderstood&#146;), and as a result exercised comparatively little influence upon him. Nor did the second baronet's mother have much obvious formative effect. She was Mary, daughter of William Chatfield, a captain in the Madras cavalry. She entered a decline when her second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7644/', "Ashton Wentworth Dilke")</script> (the explorer), was born, and died when her elder son was ten.<h2>
<a name="Youthandeducation"></a>Youth and education</h2>The family figure who was most influential in the upbringing of the second baronet was his grandfather, yet another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7645/', "Charles Wentworth Dilke (1789&#150;1864)")</script>, a prominent literary figure; together, for instance, they visited every English cathedral, as well as a great number of other English and French sights. The boy's health (although it was perfectly good from the age of eighteen onwards) was judged too delicate for him to go normally to school; he was taught mainly at home by a variety of tutors and relatives.<br>
<br>To compensate for any deficiencies Dilke was open to a wide range of cosmopolitan culture and fashion. He heard and saw all the great mid-century actors and singers, both in London and in Paris. At the age of eleven and in the first flush of display of the Second Empire he was taken to Paris for four months, and managed to observe everything from the great balls to military tattoos and gala performances at the Op&eacute;ra and the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais. He became strongly Francophone and francophile, and in subsequent summers in Normandy mingled with the fringes of the imperial family. In England he was also exposed to a remarkable range of acquaintanceship for a boy, but here it was more to men of solid achievement&#151;literary, scientific, or commercial&#151;than to the beau monde. Thackeray, Browning, Joseph Paxton, Robert Stephenson the engineer, Joseph Martin the painter, and John Forster the historian, all made an imprint upon him. When he said near the end of his life: &#145;I have known everyone worth knowing from 1850 until my death&#146;, he was not being modest, which was not in his nature, but nor was he exaggerating foolishly. When he arrived at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, his first and only educational institution, in the autumn of 1862, he had absorbed only a patchy academic instruction but a remarkable knowledge of the world.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Dilke devoted himself with almost excessive dedication to three interests: the tripos, the river, and the union (debating society), and achieved considerable success in all three. In Trinity Hall the dominant influence was Leslie Stephen, and Dilke attuned easily to his anti-emotional, muscular, competitive approach to work and games. Switching from mathematics to law after his first year, Dilke became senior legalist, the highest distinction in the university open to a law student. At rowing, which he had never done before, he stroked the Trinity Hall boat and saw it go head of the river; he recorded that he was offered a place in the university boat, but was made by his doctor to decline because of the long course on the London tideway. In the union he was not only president for two terms (his re-election was unusual) but left a more permanent mark by being mainly responsible for building the gabled Gothic premises which have since been its home.<h2>
<a name="Travelwritingandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Travel, writing, and early political career</h2>Dilke remained at Cambridge until the spring of 1866, when he was twenty-two, and then paused only to be called to the bar as a member of the Middle Temple (though he never practised) before leaving in June for a North American tour which extended itself into a year-long excursion around the world, taking in New Zealand, Australia, India, and Egypt. One result of this tour was by far the most successful of the eight books which he wrote in the course of his life. <span class="italic">Greater Britain</span> was published in the early autumn of 1868, quickly ran through four editions, and remained in print and widely read for nearly half a century. Its title was chosen to encapsulate not only his itinerary but a large part of his political philosophy. He had &#145;followed England round the world&#146;, and the conclusions he drew from his journey were at once radical and racialist. He was for what he regarded as British energy and superiority, but against such archaic British institutions as the monarchy and an oligarchic parliament. The United States, although he maintained a sharp edge of criticism during his four months there, greatly excited him. &#145;America offers the English race the moral directorship of the globe&#146;, he wrote, &#145;by ruling mankind through Saxon institutions and the English tongue. Through America, England is speaking to the world.&#146; He carried his views to the logical conclusion that Canada should sever the London connection.<br>
<br>Yet (in relation to the American Indians) he could express with pride the brutally harsh view that &#145;the Anglo-Saxon is the only extirpating race on earth&#146;; he believed in &#145;the defeat of the cheaper by the dearer peoples&#146;, and he constructed an elaborate theory that the banana was the most dangerous crop&#151;you could live on it, raw or fried, but do nothing constructive with it. Thus it offered the fatal prospect of a soft life in a soft climate. Despite such occasional excursions into fantasy his picture of America in the immediate lee of the civil war was a brilliant and memorable one, whether he was writing about Washington, with the unfinished dome of the Capitol rising above the swamp town along the Potomac, or of mammon-ridden New York, whose drawing rooms were already the most exclusive (but not the most distinguished) in the world, or of Boston (much superior), where Emerson, Longfellow, and Agassiz held sway, or of Cincinnati, where the cholera was killing 200 a day, or of the great hardships and dangers of a transcontinental journey three years before the railway link was completed. It was much the best part of the book.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Greater Britain</span> brought Dilke much attention. Gladstone read and carefully annotated his copy (though referring to it in his diary as Dilke's <span class="italic">Greater World</span>). J. S. Mill, hitherto a stranger, was captivated by it, and for the remaining four years of his life was Dilke's principal mentor. Within a few weeks of publication Dilke was elected to parliament as a radical Liberal at the top of the poll for the two-member constituency of Chelsea. He was part of a Liberal majority of 112 which made Gladstone prime minister for the first time. He was only just twenty-five and his prospects seemed dazzling.<br>
<br>A future of climbing smoothly and gradually up the ladder of conventional political success did not, however, fit in with Dilke's predilections, which were at once generous and arrogant. He took one small step up the ladder when, in February 1870, he was chosen by Gladstone to second the address, but for the most part he preferred to criticize the government for being too cautious, to work with a semi-detached group of more or less rebellious radicals, and to promote his own pet (and worthy) measures of reform. Thus in 1869 he played a leading part both in restoring to women ratepayers the right to vote in municipal elections, which they had lost in 1835, and in securing the abolition of hanging, drawing, and quartering in New Zealand. In 1870 he was one of the sharpest critics of W. E. Forster's <span class="roman">Elementary Education Bill</span>. On this he came into conflict not only with the high-Anglican approach of the prime minister but also with the nonconformist simple &#145;<span class="roman">Bible</span>-teaching&#146; approach of his normal provincial radical allies. He was more a secularist than he was a protestant, and he was the only Liberal member to vote against the Cowper-Temple compromise. Dilke was much more in the radical mainstream when he moved a crucial amendment providing that the new school boards should be directly elected rather than committees of the existing boards of guardians. The beginning of his close partnership and friendship with Joseph Chamberlain sprang out of his work on this bill and Chamberlain's first political foray as the animator of the National Education League.<h2>
<a name="Republicanismandfirstmarriage"></a>Republicanism and first marriage</h2>In the autumn of 1871 Dilke's good fortune for almost the first, but by no means the last, time in his life deserted him. He had long been a theoretical republican, although not a very actively proselytizing one. In that year, however, provoked by the continued invisibility of the queen ten years into her widowhood, the lack of respect commanded by the prince of Wales, and the frequent applications to parliament for allowances or dowries for royal children, he decided to use a series of constitutional addresses in provincial cities for the deployment of a somewhat tentative republican case. He began at Newcastle in early November, and made enough impact to provoke a heavily rebuking <span class="italic">Times</span> leader. Much more damaging to him than this, however, was the dramatic recovery of the prince of Wales from typhoid. The prince accomplished more for the popularity of the monarchy in 1871 than during the whole of his previous thirty years of life.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Dilke had to continue with his speaking programme, from Bristol to Leeds to Bolton and Birmingham, in an increasingly hostile climate. He also felt that he could not abandon the issue without repeating in the House of Commons what he had said outside. It took him some months to get a day, then on 19 March 1872 he went down to defeat by 276 votes to 2, and abandoned the subject with relief. It cost him a year or two of semi-ostracism in parliament and society, and the hostility of the queen for the remaining thirty years of her reign.<br>
<br>In the early 1870s there were two other disparate ingredients in his life which showed that Dilke was not exactly as other men were. During the Franco-Prussian War he demonstrated the cosmopolitan adventurer side of his character. In late July and August 1870 he travelled with the Prussian army and was present on most of the battlefields of their victorious campaign. Then he switched sides, or at least location, and was in Paris on 4 September for the fall of the empire and the proclamation of the republic. During the subsequent nine months of siege and commune he was in and out of Paris and the trajectories of the shells of different nations and ideologies.<br>
<br>Then, between January 1872 and September 1874, there was the brief interlude of Dilke's first marriage. His wife was Katherine Mary Eliza Sheil, the daughter of a long-dead Captain Arthur Gore Sheil of the 89th foot; from her mother, also dead, a member of an old Devon family, the Wises, she had acquired property and connection in Devon. She possessed, according to Dilke, an unusual combination of attributes: extreme attractiveness of appearance, vivacity, intimidating violence of temper, and debilitating ill health. She sang and she played croquet to professional standards. They were married suddenly and semi-secretly on 30 January 1872. In December 1873 the Dilkes went to Monte Carlo, with Kate recovering from the death of a stillborn son; there Dilke wrote <span class="italic">The Fall of Prince Florestan</span> (1874), a picaresque novel. At the time of the marriage there was little suggestion that they were seriously in love with each other; yet when Kate died in childbirth on 20 September 1874 Dilke became deranged&#151;&#145;When I was mad&#146;, he later wrote of the period.<br>
<br>Dilke fled to Paris, shaved off his beard, and lived in secret isolation for six weeks, until he was recognized in the street by L&eacute;on Gambetta. Gambetta was a genuine friend who brought him back to sanity. But it was typical of Dilke that, even in such a condition of disarray, it should be the most famous Frenchman of the day who found him. He spent most of December and January in north Africa, became a teetotaller (which he remained for eleven years) and a vegetarian, and returned to London, though remaining in an enfeebled condition until Easter, for the beginning of the parliamentary session in 1875. During his four and a half months' absence he had left everything in London, including the naming and baptism of his new-born son, to be settled by his grandmother. At least the name caused her little problem: he became the fourth Charles Wentworth Dilke, but added no lustre to the name before his early death in 1918.<h2>
<a name="Arisingpolitician"></a>A rising politician</h2>Dilke himself had a successful summer in the House of Commons, initiating four debates, each of which paved the way for future reforms. He also renewed an interrupted friendship with the notable historian of French art who, ten years later, was to become his second wife [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32825/', "Dilke, Emilia Francis (1840&#150;1904)")</script>]. She had been born Emilia Francis Strong, the daughter of Major Henry Strong of the Indian army, was three years older than Dilke, and was currently unhappily married to Mark Pattison, rector of Lincoln College, Oxford. Having thus re-established both his parliamentary and his emotional bearings, Dilke left for a second world trip, taking in America, Japan, China, and Singapore between August 1875 and January 1876.<br>
<br>During the four years that intervened between his return and the Liberal victory in the spring of 1880, Dilke's most important activity was the forging of an alliance between himself and Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain, after his not altogether successful foray with the National Education League, had been a brilliantly constructive mayor of Birmingham in 1873&#150;6. Then, with his fortieth birthday approaching, he decided that, if he was to make a comparable impact on the national scene, he must quickly enter parliament. One of the three members for Birmingham had hinted that he might retire. Thereupon he was ejected from the seat with all the certainty and expedition with which the mechanism works in a modern fighter aircraft. It was a tribute to the effectiveness of the Birmingham machine that Chamberlain had built up, and to the ruthlessness with which he was prepared to use it. In 1877 he also used this Birmingham caucus as the nucleus around which he built the National Liberal Federation, which brought together most of the radically inclined constituency organizations in the other big towns.<br>
<br>Chamberlain was thus a most valuable ally for Dilke, who as a metropolitan parliamentarian, most of whose outside contacts were across the channel and even the oceans, lacked lines of communication with provincial radicalism. Chamberlain was a much better speaker than Dilke, and in the last resort a more formidable, if not more attractive, personality. But he lacked Dilke's parliamentary experience, his knowledge of the fashionable world, and his foreign affairs expertise. They therefore each had balancing advantages to bring to the partnership, and Dilke deliberately set about exploiting his by acting as Chamberlain's sponsor in metropolitan life, putting him up at 76 Sloane Street and giving frequent dinner parties to introduce him to a wider world. They were very useful to each other, and there was probably also a genuine degree of emotional attachment, although stronger on Dilke's side than on Chamberlain's.<br>
<br>These four years saw Gladstone's re-entry into political leadership after his brief retirement. It began with his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Bulgarian Atrocities</span> (1876) and it ended with the Midlothian campaign (1879&#150;80). Neither Chamberlain nor Dilke was dazzled by Gladstone, who was too moralizing for their taste. Chamberlain, however, tried to make use of him for the launch of the National Liberal Federation and as a counterweight to Hartington. Dilke found his sentimental generalities offensive to the <i>realpolitik</i> based on detailed knowledge which was always his own approach to foreign policy, and mostly preferred the cool whiggery of Hartington. This was not because he agreed with Hartington's domestic conservatism, but because he thought it would have to be compensated for within the Liberal Party by giving great positions, even the Foreign Office and the exchequer, to himself and Chamberlain. Such a triumvirate, leading after an interval to the emergence of one or the other radical as leader of a Lib&#150;Lab party, dedicated to social reform and unfrightened by collectivism, became the strategic aim of Dilke (and less clearly of Chamberlain) from the late 1870s onwards. The significance of Dilke's fall in 1885&#150;6 was that, by allowing Chamberlain to block the early achievement of home rule (which an unweakened Dilke might well have prevented him from doing), it kept Gladstone in politics for nearly another decade, drove the Liberal Party along the worthy but sterile axis of an Irish-dominated policy, and opened the way for the emergence of an Independent Labour Party, which eventually ended the Liberal governing tradition.<h2>
<a name="Inoffice18801885"></a>In office, 1880&#150;1885</h2>Before these developments there were the five years of Gladstone's second government and of Dilke's only experience of office, as opposed to previous promise and subsequent contemplation of what might have been. After the 1880 election but before the formation of the government, Chamberlain proposed to Dilke, who was thought of as the better placed of the two, that neither should accept office unless they were both in the cabinet. Dilke thought this might be over-bidding on Chamberlain's part, which was ironical as the eventual outcome was that Dilke, the first to be approached, by holding out for one cabinet post between them, forced Chamberlain into the presidency of the Board of Trade over his head, and had himself to settle for under-secretary at the Foreign Office, though with the advantage that his chief, Granville, was in the Lords. He began his official duties on 27 April 1880.<br>
<br>Dilke then had to wait nearly three years for promotion, in spite of his being a notably effective minister, especially in the complex matter of the renegotiation of the trade treaty with France. Delay in promotion was partly due to a combination of the queen's determination not to have him in any office &#145;close to the sovereign&#146; and of his own taste for high-stake play. The latter attribute showed itself in May 1882, when the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish dramatically created a vacancy in the office of chief secretary for Ireland. Dilke was offered it, without membership of the cabinet. A lesser man would have felt it necessary to accept to avoid a charge of cowardice. Dilke coolly held out. He would not accept responsibility without power. Eventually, in December 1882, he entered the cabinet as president of the Local Government Board. It was perhaps the least glamorous of all departments, and one which certainly met the queen's demand that he should not be close to her person. But it was also one suited to Dilke's talents, and which he made more constructively central to the government than were the great traditional departments. He set up, and himself presided over, a royal commission on the housing of the working classes in 1884, which had perhaps the most remarkable membership of any royal commission ever assembled. There sat under him the trio of the prince of Wales, Cardinal Manning, and Lord Salisbury. Octavia Hill was vetoed (as a woman) by a combination of Harcourt and Hartington, but he none the less secured three other former or future cabinet ministers among the dozen members. He was also a member of the quintet of ministers which fatefully took all the decisions in relation to the dispatch of General Gordon to evacuate the Sudan.<br>
<br>Dilke's best work was, however, done on the <span class="roman">Redistribution of Seats Bill</span> in 1885, which was of repercussive as well as inherent importance because it unblocked the passage into law of the <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span> of 1884, which extended household suffrage from the towns to the counties, and was the most important reform carried through by that somewhat sterile government of 1880&#150;85. The Lords would not pass it without a redistribution bill. Chamberlain responded with a violent denunciation of the peers, Dilke by being (with Gladstone) the key figure in negotiating with Salisbury in November 1885 a settlement that seemed acceptable from a Liberal point of view, and piloting the resultant bill through the House of Commons with skill and authority. In both the negotiations and the parliamentary process he had the decisive (and for him typical) advantage of knowing twice as much about the subject as anyone else.<br>
<br>It was not therefore fanciful by the spring of 1885 to see Dilke, perhaps after a Hartington interlude, as Gladstone's most likely successor. His radical credentials were secure, but he was also a man who could work the system and get things done. The government was admittedly on the brink of disintegration. Nearly half its members, including Dilke and Chamberlain, had submitted their resignations. Nevertheless few doubted there would be a bright medium-term Liberal future, underpinned by the extension of the franchise, and that Dilke would have a major part in it. He was also about to be married again, having announced his engagement to the recently widowed Mrs Pattison in the autumn of 1884.<h2>
<a name="TheCrawforddivorce"></a>The Crawford divorce</h2>In June 1885 the government&#151;further weakened by a row about a central board for Ireland promoted by Chamberlain and Dilke&#151;was defeated on the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> and resigned. This was a blow which, with his prospects as they appeared to be, Dilke was easily able to survive. In the following month there fell a very different sort of blow and one that was wholly fatal to his career in high politics. Virginia Crawford, the 22-year-old wife of Donald Crawford, a dour Scottish Liberal lawyer, and also the sister of Mrs Ashton Dilke, his brother's wife, made first a confession to her husband and then a public accusation that Dilke had seduced her in 1882 (the first year of her marriage) and had then conducted an intermittent affair with her for two and a half years. Dilke resolutely denied the charges, although his position was complicated from the beginning by the fact that he had, both before and after his first marriage, been the lover of her mother, Ellen, Mrs Eustace Smith. The case followed a tortuous legal course, during which period Dilke was excluded from any effective political action, despite its being the most seismic year in late nineteenth-century politics. He did manage to get narrowly returned for a new and smaller Chelsea constituency in November 1885 (although he lost it in a second general election eight months later). This apart, everything went from bad to worse for him, each act of the tragedy plumbing new depths.<br>
<br>The Crawford divorce action was heard and decided in one day on 12 February 1886. Donald Crawford took the court through the details of the confession and one or two vaguely corroborating servants were called. Mrs Crawford was not in court. Dilke's lawyers, aided by the lay advice of Chamberlain, took the view that he should not give evidence. No evidence had been adduced against him (&#145;I cannot see any case whatsoever against Sir Charles Dilke&#146;, the judge was later to say), and they feared his being cross-examined about the whole of his past life. The result was that Crawford got his divorce but that Dilke was dismissed from the suit as having no case to answer. It might have been satisfactory for a private individual, but not for a public figure. The verdict appeared to be the perverse one that Mrs Crawford had committed adultery with Dilke, but that he had not done so with her.<br>
<br>A public campaign, greatly fostered by the early investigative journalist W. T. Stead, was then mounted against Dilke's failure to go into the witness box. By April this had persuaded him that he should seek to reopen the case by getting the queen's proctor to intervene. He did so under a grave misapprehension. He falsely assumed that his counsel would be able to submit Mrs Crawford to a devastating cross-examination. But he had been dismissed from the case and his counsel had no <i>locus</i>. Furthermore the queen's proctor had to try to prove a negative, that Dilke had not committed adultery, before Mrs Crawford was exposed in the witness box. It was he and not she who was subjected to a most stringent and damaging cross-examination. The result was a disaster. He proved a very bad witness, she a very good one. The summing up by the president of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division was highly unfavourable to Dilke. The verdict of the jury&#151;in form that the divorce should stand, in fact that Mrs Crawford was a witness of the truth and that Dilke was not&#151;was reached quickly and unanimously.<br>
<br>Dilke's career and reputation were shattered. Indeed the question for a time was whether he was to be subject to a criminal prosecution for perjury, carrying the risk of a long sentence of penal servitude and the sequestration of his property. When this threat was removed he and his wife (they had been married on 3 October 1885, after the scandal had broken) devoted themselves to his case for several years, with the help of a few devoted &#145;believers&#146; and the expenditure of a good deal of money on enquiry agents. Much helpful evidence was accumulated, certainly enough to prove the central thesis that, contrary to the view of the court, Mrs Crawford lied in the witness box, and that her activities which she described as having taken place with Dilke were either figments of her imagination or, more probably, had taken place with others.<br>
<br>Elements of highly charged mystery remained. Dilke, although almost certainly not guilty as charged, obviously had things to hide in his life. But what prompted Mrs Crawford's false story? Cardinal Manning, who instructed her for her reception into the Roman Catholic church in 1889 and was amiably disposed towards Dilke, was said to know the whole truth, but never revealed it. There were conspiracy theories, some involving figures as eminent as Rosebery (no evidence worth speaking of) and Chamberlain (some considerable circumstantial evidence but an absence of convincing motive), and others involving several ladies who had grievances against Dilke. These enigmas have remained unresolved for over a hundred years, and are unlikely now ever to be fully explained.<h2>
<a name="Latercareeranddeath"></a>Later career and death</h2>Dilke re-entered the House of Commons, and sat for the Forest of Dean, still as an advanced radical, from 1892 until his death nineteen years later. He achieved great local popularity, particularly with the miners of what was then a detached but significant small coalfield. He vigorously pursued their interests and those of labour generally, as well as being an independent parliamentary expert on military, colonial, and foreign questions, and was an important link with Labour members and trade unionists. He was a vital influence in the founding of the committee of imperial defence in 1904, a subject he had discussed in works such as <span class="italic">Problems of Greater Britain</span> (2 vols., 1890) and <span class="italic">Imperial Defence</span> (1892, written with Spenser Wilkinson). His reputation abroad held up rather better than at home, though in the Commons he became a respected independent back-bencher. But he never again came near to political office. The last third of his life was a sad anticlimax. He spent part of it preparing his large collection of manuscript papers for posterity by mutilating them with a pair of scissors. The death in 1904 of his second wife (whose memoir he wrote as a preface to <span class="italic">The Book of the Spiritual Life</span>, 1905) and the mental illness and subsequent incarceration of his son and heir greatly disturbed him. Dilke died of heart failure at his house, 76 Sloane Street, London, on 26 January 1911, and was cremated at Golders Green on 30 January after a funeral service at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Square, London. During his son's illness, Dilke altered his will, largely in favour of May Tennant and Gertrude Tuckwell, his second wife's niece and, with Stephen Gwynn, his biographer.<br>
