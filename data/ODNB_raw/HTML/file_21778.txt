<span class="headword">Pegge, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1764/5&#150;1822), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Westminster, London, the only son and one of the two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21780/', "Samuel Pegge the younger (1733&#150;1800)")</script>, barrister, antiquary, poet, and musical composer, and his first wife, Martha (1732&#150;1767), daughter of Henry Bourne, an eminent Derbyshire physician. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner in April 1782. As an undergraduate he simultaneously held the Fell and Boulter exhibitions worth &pound;10 and &pound;8 respectively. He graduated BA on 23 February 1786 and was elected a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1788. In the following year he graduated MA and BM.<br>
<br>In 1789 Pegge began to practise medicine in Oxford. Opinion about his professional capabilities and achievements has varied. For example, Cox notes that while he had the ability and personality to have excelled in a fashionable part of London, he ran a &#145;hopeless race&#146; in Oxford because he was in competition with two of the most popular physicians the city had ever seen, doctors Martin Wall and Robert Bourne  (Cox, 132&#150;3). On the other hand, Munk asserted that Pegge was &#145;for many years the leading physician&#146; in Oxford, sharing with Bourne &#145;the medical emoluments of the university and neighbourhood&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>, 450). Later historians dismissed him as &#145;a physician of dubious distinction&#146;  (Bill, 137), or maintained that his science was &#145;superficial&#146;  (Vassall, 340). Pegge resigned his Oriel fellowship in 1790 in order to return to Christ Church and take up the post of Lee's reader in anatomy. His duties as reader involved the delivery of two courses of lectures per year. His lecturing style has been described as both &#145;spirited&#146; and &#145;easy and correct&#146; (Tuckwell, 60&#150;1; Cox, 132&#150;3). At first his lectures were extremely popular, and it was &#145;not thought to be the thing to leave Oxford without attending one course&#146;  (Gibson, 107). Subsequently, however, Pegge came to be regarded as something of a bore. In 1790 he was elected a physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary, a position he held until 1808 when the asthma from which he long suffered obliged him to reduce his workload. On 29 March 1791 he married Amy, daughter of Kenton Couse of Whitehall in London. They had one daughter, Mary, born on 26 December 1791, who married the Revd R. M. Boultbee of Merton College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Pegge was awarded his DM in 1792. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1795 and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1796. He delivered the college's Harveian oration in 1805, and in 1817, having moved to London, he became a college censor. In 1799, soon after the duke of York had inspected the Oxford Loyal Volunteers, in which Pegge served as a major, George III conferred a knighthood on him. In 1801 he was appointed regius professor of physic, in which capacity he gave occasional lectures on aspects of animal economy and held the mastership of a charitable foundation, the Ewelme Hospital. Otherwise he had few duties. As for the authorship of papers and monographs, medical or otherwise, he appears to have written nothing whatsoever. Such reticence stands in contrast with the records of his father and paternal grandfather (Samuel Pegge the elder), both of whom achieved formidable literary outputs.<br>
<br>In his prime Pegge was &#145;a showy, handsome man&#146;  (Tuckwell, 60&#150;61), with a &#145;fine portly figure and gentlemanly manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Characters</span>, 261). As regius professor he cut a somewhat absurd figure for, notwithstanding his comparative youth, he affected the old-fashioned habit of cocked hat, wig, and massive gold-headed cane, all of which were spurned by his successor in the post, John Kidd. In 1816 an increased incidence and severity of asthmatic attack led Pegge to resign the Lee readership and to take up residence in George Street, Hanover Square, London in the hope of recovering his health. He engaged in medical practice in the capital but later moved to Hastings in Sussex, again for reasons of health. The modest obligations associated with the regius professorship enabled him to retain the post even after he had departed Oxford; he had merely to make occasional appearances at the university in accordance with its statutes. In the course of one of these visits, while occupying his lodgings in the High Street, he suffered an unusually severe asthmatic fit from which he died on 3 August 1822. He was interred in the south aisle of Ewelme church. His wife survived him.<br>
