<span class="headword">O'Cullenan,  John</span> <span class="st"> [E&oacute;in &Oacute; Cuileann&aacute;in]</span>  (1584/5&#150;1656?), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Raphoe</span>, was born at Mullaghnashee, Ballyshannon, co. Donegal, the seventh and youngest son of Donncha Ballach &Oacute; Cuileann&aacute;in, gentleman, and his wife, In&iacute;on Dubh N&iacute; Dhu&iacute;bhir. The O'Cullenans, of royal Munster descent, were prominent followers of the O'Donnells of T&iacute;r Conaill, and Niall, Donncha's brother, and Cormac, his son, fought in Red Hugh's campaigns. Donncha's wife was presumably related to &Eacute;mann Dubh &Oacute; Du&iacute;bhir, abbot of Assaroe. John O'Cullenan had at least one sister, mother of Father Philip Clery, reputedly martyred in 1642. The Cistercian abbey of Assaroe adjoined Mullaghnashee, and John had four Cistercian brothers, three at least, including <a href="#cosubject_68537">Gelasius [<i>see below</i>]</a>, being abbots.<br>
<br>Despite the disparity in their ages, John O'Cullenan's eldest brother was <a name="cosubject_68537"></a><span class="headword">Gelasius <span class="st"> [Glaisne]</span> O'Cullenan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1580), <span class="occ">Cistercian monk</span>. Born at Mullaghnashee, he became a Cistercian monk, probably at nearby Abbey Assaroe, a daughter-house of Boyle Abbey, co. Roscommon, Latinizing his name to Gelasius, and was ordained priest. He studied at Louvain and Paris, becoming DTh of the Sorbonne. While in Paris he was appointed titular abbot of Boyle (still functioning although suppressed), and went there about 1579, apparently by way of Rome. Setting vigorously about restoring monastic life and ministering to the neighbouring population, he received practical help from a local personage, possibly MacDermot of Moylurg. He went to Dublin and secured from the privy council sanction for permission, previously given, for a limited monastic revival at Boyle. But John Garvey, dean of Christ Church, Dublin, fearful of the damage done to the Reformation cause in Connaught and Ulster by the zeal of Gelasius, persuaded his fellow councillors to have him and his companion E&oacute;in O'Mulkern, the Premonstratensian abbot of Loch C&eacute; monastery, near Boyle, arrested. Offers of high office in the established church were made in vain to both. They were then cruelly tortured and afterwards tried, probably by martial law, for treason, in that they rejected the queen's ecclesiastical authority as expressed in the 1560 <span class="roman">Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity</span>. Found guilty, they were hanged and, it seems, then beheaded at the public place of execution outside Dublin city, on 21 November 1580. The Cistercian historians Henr&iacute;quez and Hartry claim that their steadfast demeanour brought 500 bystanders back to the practice of Catholicism. Gelasius's place of burial is unknown. The reputation as martyrs (<i>fama martyrii</i>) of the two was constant from the beginning.<br>
<br>John O'Cullenan was fostered by Sir Hugh O'Donnell and then studied humanities at home for four years, going on at the age of twenty to the Irish College, Salamanca. He read theology at Louvain, Paris, Rome, and Rheims, where he became DTh. Tutor to the earl of Tyrconnell in Brussels, he was made vicar apostolic (1621), and then in 1625 (consecrated 1626) bishop, of his native diocese of Raphoe. Arrested in 1628 in an invasion scare, he was in 1636 gaoled for three months in Dublin Castle by an actively protestant administration. Imprisonment and penury took their toll on his health. Yet the bishops had made some progress in reorganizing Catholicism, and he as vice-primate, with extensive faculties of absolving and dispensing, was busy. While his chiefly rank merited him eulogy in seven poems in <i>deibhidhe</i> metre by the T&iacute;r Conaill bards, he himself was aware of the pastoral value of the contemporary literary activity&#151;historical, ascetical, and apologetic&#151;in Irish.<br>
<br>Taken captive again in 1642 O'Cullenan narrowly escaped the fate of the seventy-two insurgents accompanying him, who were slaughtered by the protestant Lagan forces in north-west Ulster, only to endure the rigours of a Londonderry dungeon for four years. He refused to conform to the established church and was eventually released, arriving in Kilkenny in April 1647. He supported Rinuccini's condemnation of the Ormond peace of 1646 and the cessation with Lord Inchiquin of 1648. One of the three bishops who followed the nuncio to Galway, he endured the months of siege of that city by the marquess of Clanricarde. At Ormond's instance he treated with Owen Roe O'Neill at Ballykelly in August 1649, but no agreement was reached. At this time the bishops, he among them, sought Catholic unity in defence of faith and king. Then in September 1650 he was chief of the committee of four bishops who at Jamestown made public the excommunication of all who supported Ormond, the viceroy.<br>
<br>Driven to take refuge on Inishbofin, O'Cullenan and Bishop Lynch of Clonfert were exiled by the parliamentarians in 1653, and reached Brussels in April. With the divisions among Irish Catholics caused by Rinuccini's censures still persisting, O'Cullenan was now among those who called for a general absolution. Pope Alexander VII, however, demanded prior repentance and gave to O'Cullenan and three other named bishops sole power to absolve. The pope's brief (2 August 1655) was published in Belgium, prefixed by a passionate appeal to all who had opposed the censures to seek absolution. While this appeal, O'Ferrall thought, was the work of Dr Walter Enos, it appeared over the names of O'Cullenan (the only bishop of the four resident in Belgium) and his three colleagues. It may be taken as his curtain speech in the fateful Irish drama in which he had played a part. A list of Irish bishops in 1656 does not include his name, which suggests that he probably died earlier that year. He is buried in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin, in the church of Sts Michael and Gudule, Brussels.<br>
