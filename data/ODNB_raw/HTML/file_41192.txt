<span class="headword">Cartimandua <span class="st"> [Claudia Cartimandua, Julia Cartimandua]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69), <span class="occ">queen of the Brigantes</span>, a large tribal grouping in northern Britain, was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48306/', "Venutius")</script>, with whom she quarrelled and whom she replaced after <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57 with Vellocatus, his armour bearer; no offspring are known. She died after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69, when she lost her throne to Venutius and took refuge with the Romans.<br>
<br>Under Cartimandua, the Brigantes seem to have been the largest of the British tribes of the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, occupying the greater part of the north of the province. They are probably best seen as an agglomeration of tribes, from one of which Cartimandua emerged as queen, perhaps by succession, for she was queen in her own right and there is mention of her illustrious birth. Given the size and diversity of the Brigantes, it is probable that she found it difficult to exercise complete and steady control throughout her realm.<br>
<br>Knowledge of Cartimandua is derived almost entirely from the writings of the Roman historian Tacitus, composed half a century after her floruit. She was one of the several female rulers of Britain and Germany who fascinated the Roman male author. In any case she could only be of prime concern to Tacitus in view of the scope of her realm and the importance of its location on the northern frontier of the expanding Roman province in Britain. Her capital has been located variously (for example, at York and at Aldborough): if she had a single centre (which cannot be assumed), then archaeology suggests that Stanwick (near Scotch Corner, north Yorkshire) is its most likely location. Everything that is known about Cartimandua indicates her allegiance to Rome, which seems to have been a constant feature of her rule. Indeed, the Roman source tends to suggest that she depended upon Roman support for the retention of her throne.<br>
<br>Cartimandua enters history in the pages of Tacitus in the year <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51, when she handed in chains to the Romans the British leader Caratacus, a thorn in their side for almost a decade. It is related that Caratacus came to her in search of refuge from his Roman enemies and that he was passed to the Romans against his will. If that is the whole story, Cartimandua could be accused of treachery, even allowing for the inter-tribal hostilities that characterized ancient Britain. However, Cartimandua's closeness to Rome (subsequently, at any rate) made her an odd choice by Caratacus as a protectress against Rome. It may be that Caratacus came to Cartimandua not simply in search of refuge but also to engage her services as a mediator to negotiate his surrender: he certainly suffered no great punishment at Roman hands, thanks perhaps to Cartimandua's negotiating skills. In any event, she gained great credit at Rome for providing the emperor Claudius with Caratacus, who became the centrepiece of his celebration of victory in Britain.<br>
<br>Cartimandua's accession cannot be dated. She may have been on the throne for decades before <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51, even before Claudius's invasion of Britain in 43. As a royal ally of Rome under the principate, she would have been awarded Roman citizenship, if she had not inherited it. If granted her citizenship by the emperor Claudius (<i>r</i>. <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 41&#150;54), she had the right to call herself Claudia Cartimandua. If her citizenship derived (directly or indirectly) from a grant of an earlier emperor, she was Julia Cartimandua. Neither name is attested, but one was certainly hers.<br>
<br>Evidence for the rest of Cartimandua's reign comes from two passages in Tacitus, one in his <span class="italic">Histories</span> (iii.45), completed about 110, and the other in his <span class="italic">Annals</span> (xii.40), completed about 116. Over the last century there has been recurrent and polarized scholarly debate on the relationship of these two passages. On the face of it, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xii.40, describes Cartimandua's activities about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57, while <span class="italic">Histories</span>, iii.45, treats events of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69. Yet, given some broad similarities between the two passages, it has been argued that they are in fact doublets and that <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xii.40, is somehow a Tacitean error, the events described in the two passages having actually occurred together in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69. However, such similarities as exist between the two passages are quite inadequate to support so large an inference: most of them derive from the fact that the <span class="italic">Histories</span> passage briefly reprises earlier events (subsequently recorded at <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xii.40) as background to the events of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69, with which it is primarily concerned. Despite persistent controversy, there can be no real doubt that the two passages present two different events, as they claim to do, and with two very different outcomes: after the events of <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57 Cartimandua retained power, but in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69 she was deprived of her throne.<br>
<br>Cartimandua had taken a consort from among the Brigantes, named Venutius; he probably came from a powerful subgroup within the large Brigantian realm. In <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57, like Cartimandua, Venutius had a long record of fidelity to Rome; together they had prospered in alliance with Rome. But about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57 they fell out; Tacitus, disposed to moralizing, blamed the damaging effects of growing prosperity in the wake of the Caratacus affair. Their quarrel became a wider internal conflict, doubtless always a threat within the large and disjointed kingdom. Cartimandua remained close to Rome, but Venutius now became hostile, not only to the queen but also to her Roman supporters. It may be significant that he is not mentioned in the Caratacus affair: it seems that Cartimandua had taken all the responsibility in that affair and had received all the credit.<br>
<br>Cartimandua captured the brother and kinsfolk of Venutius by trickery, precipitating a major civil war among the Brigantes. It seems that Venutius's forces could be imagined as invaders from outside Cartimandua's realm, supporting the probability that he represented a regional grouping. Tacitus prefers to focus upon the supposed objections of the Brigantes to being ruled by a woman, which were very much his own. However, Cartimandua's Roman allies had foreseen the invasion of Venutius's forces and after fierce fighting repelled it; thanks to the Romans, the queen retained her throne, while Venutius was left hostile to her and to Rome.<br>
<br>In Venutius's place, Cartimandua took Vellocatus, his erstwhile armour bearer. Perhaps Vellocatus represented some of the interests which had brought Venutius to prominence; again, Tacitus prefers to moralize. In <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69 Venutius attacked again, taking advantage of an uprising against Cartimandua among the Brigantes. This time Cartimandua's Roman allies had not anticipated his attack, doubtless more concerned with the tumultuous civil wars of their own in that year. Some Roman auxiliary infantry and cavalry arrived in time to save the queen's life, but not her throne. From <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69 Venutius was king of the Brigantes.<br>
<br>Cartimandua's fate thereafter is unknown. A fragmentary inscription from Chester, which may mention a woman, has been taken to refer to her; it has been suggested that she lived out her days there. It is very likely that Cartimandua enjoyed a privileged retirement, as did other client rulers with similar histories, but there is nothing to connect her with Chester. It is just as likely that she retired to Italy, even Rome. Since she was well established as queen by <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51, she was probably dead by 100.<br>
<br>Cartimandua had done Rome a great service through the middle of the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. The Brigantes were not an easy people to rule: they were diverse and apparently prone to unrest. Cartimandua's difficulties with Venutius, which Tacitus couches in personal and moralistic terms, seem to have been symptomatic of a broader instability among the Brigantes.<br>
