<span class="headword">Hanbury,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1608), <span class="occ">goldsmith and ironmaster</span>, was born at Elmley Lovett, Worcestershire, the only son of John Hanbury of Elmley Lovett and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Brode of Dunclent, Worcestershire. He came of a long line of small landowners in Worcestershire. He married Alice (1538&#150;1593), heir of Jasper Fisher, royal goldsmith to Queen Mary, on 28 April 1560. They had two daughters and lived first in Goldsmiths' Row, in the City of London, and later at Riding Court, near Datchet in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Sworn in as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1555, Hanbury progressed through the various offices to prime warden in 1591. Meanwhile in 1570 he had been introduced to the Company of Mineral and Battery Works (founded in 1565) and thereafter concerned himself mainly with developing an iron industry in south Wales. The older iron industry in Sussex and the weald of Kent was by then in decline, at a time when the demand for iron goods was rising fast.<br>
<br>Hanbury's first efforts as an ironmaster were devoted to making a success of the company's wireworks at Tintern and to supplying the necessary high-grade (osmund) iron from his own forges. As time went by, however, he saw better prospects in disengaging from the wireworks and, in effect, holding them to ransom by securing as many as possible of the local sources of ore and most of the nearby woods suitable for charcoal making. As a spokesman for the company put it in 1593, &#145;the works have no provision of good osmond iron but from him [Hanbury] both that for all the best mines in Monmouthshire be his and almost all the woods within ten miles compas thereof be his also&#146;  (Sir Richard Martyn to Lord Burghley, BL, Lansdowne MS, 75/90). However, osmund iron was expensive to produce and there was more profit in producing merchant iron for a wider market. When Hanbury began sending cheaper iron to the wireworks, the company appealed to the privy council, making much play of the hardship caused to the workers and their families when the poor quality of the wire made it difficult to sell. Despite continued pressure on him, Hanbury continued to send inferior iron to Tintern until in 1598 the privy council ordered his arrest, together with his son-in-law Edmund Wheeler, and they were committed to the Fleet prison. Three months later they made their submission and were released. The supply thereafter of reasonable quantities of osmund iron to the wireworks, at a price Hanbury still claimed was uneconomic, does not seem seriously to have reduced his profits.<br>
<br>Another contentious issue at times had been the cutting of timber for charcoal, which had culminated in two or three clashes between Hanbury's woodcutters and armed parties of those who felt that their ancient rights to cut what they needed were being put at risk. For whatever reason, these disputes died down after 1580 and it is now possible to see that the extra value given to Monmouthshire woods by the demand for charcoal did much to ensure their survival.<br>
<br>Richard Hanbury was the most enterprising and successful ironmaster of the sixteenth century in Wales, not least because he had the deviousness and lack of scruple needed to overcome entrenched opposition. His works were principally concentrated around what later became the town of Pontypool, but he also had forges in Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, as well as depots in Bristol and London. His workforce, probably never more than 200 strong, would spend the summer months in the woods producing charcoal, and the winter, when the rivers were better able to turn the water-wheels that worked the bellows, making iron. Hanbury sat for Minehead in the parliament of 1593; Minehead was probably one of the ports to which he shipped his iron.<br>
<br>Richard Hanbury died on 20 May 1608 and was laid beside his wife in Datchet church. His total bequests, besides land in Buckinghamshire, Worcestershire, and south Wales, amounted to &pound;17,850, together with &pound;5000 invested in the ironworks. These last, and his land in south Wales and Worcestershire, passed to his nephew and executor, John Hanbury.<br>
