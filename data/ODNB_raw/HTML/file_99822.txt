<span class="headword">Witherington <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Cornioley]</span>,  (Cecile) Pearl</span>  (1914&#150;2008), <span class="occ">special operations officer</span>, was born in Paris on 24 June 1914, the eldest of the four daughters of Wallace Seckham Witherington (1879&#150;1932), the last surviving male member of an old Northumbrian fighting family, and his wife, Gertrude, n&eacute;e Hearn. She also had four brothers, all of whom died in infancy. Her family were gentry in reduced circumstances&#151;her father drank heavily&#151;and lived in Paris to save money. She was brought up there, becoming bilingual in French and English. Once she remembered coming home from school and finding the family's furniture in the street, because the apartment's rent was so long overdue. She later described her father (on her marriage certificate) as an architect, but it is doubtful that he ever practised. (His father, Walter Seckham Witherington, was an architect who designed, among other buildings, Carlyle Mansions in Chelsea.) When her parents separated, she and her sisters stayed with their mother. She went to elementary school in Paris, and learned to type.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out in September 1939 Pearl Witherington went to the British embassy, where the family was known, and volunteered for war work; she became an extra cipher clerk for the air attach&eacute;. Early in June 1940 she found the embassy closed&#151;no one had remembered to tell her that the other staff had fled to Tours. She then realized the Germans were approaching Paris and took her mother and sisters down to Marseilles, crossing the demarcation line into unoccupied France illegally&#151;her first clandestine operation.<br>
<br>The family was repatriated to England, and the air ministry found Pearl a post as personal assistant to a senior staff officer. She decided that this was no way for a Witherington to make war. She heard of the Special Operations Executive and volunteered for its independent French section. She learned guerilla and sabotage skills, proved herself the best shot of her intake, was commissioned into the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and parachuted into France on the night of 22&#150;3 September 1943. She was initially courier to Maurice Southgate's enormous Stationer circuit, which covered much of central France, and for over seven months travelled incessantly, by train, bicycle, or on foot, carrying arms and messages, disguised as Genevieve Touzalin, a cosmetics saleswoman. Though frequently passing through police and security controls, she was never arrested, despite many close shaves. The circuit was preparing groups of saboteurs who would make the Germans' rear areas unavailable to them after the impending invasion, and executed some useful coups, including blowing up a big Michelin tyre factory at Montlu&ccedil;on.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1944 Southgate fell into a Gestapo trap, which Witherington avoided. She then settled down to run a smaller circuit of her own, codenamed Wrestler, in the Sologne. Though a woman, at a time when women had no votes in France, and a foreigner, she accumulated a private army nearly 3000 strong, armed with hand weapons parachuted to her from England. The Germans heard of her, and offered a million francs for her capture; no one who knew her betrayed her. Henri Charles Willy Cornioley (1910&#150;1999), a French pharmaceutical chemist to whom she had become engaged before the outbreak of war, joined her <i>en maquis</i> and fought beside her. (Neither family had approved the engagement: his because she was a protestant, hers because they did not think him a gentleman.) Her circuit brought rail traffic across the Sologne almost to a standstill after the Normandy landings, and ambushed road convoys heading for the front. It also helped to corral and force the surrender of a body of 18,000 German troops trying to retreat from south-western France back into the Reich. The region was overrun by the United States army late in August. She took Henri back to England with her, and they were married in Kensington register office on 26 October 1944. They had one daughter, Claire.<br>
<br>After the liberation of France, Pearl Cornioley was sent to the USA on a propaganda mission. This was not a great success because this small, correct, uniformed woman had none of the glamour an American audience expected of a secret agent. Her superiors sent her a civil MBE; she sent it back, saying she had done nothing civil. The air ministry secured her a military MBE, and she was advanced to CBE in 2004. The French also appointed her to the l&eacute;gion d'honneur. In 1946 she returned to Paris, to a small flat she and Henri bought in the rue Pergol&egrave;se. She ran the secretarial side of the World Bank for many years. When she retired, and Henri's health began to fail, she sold the flat and moved with him to a <i>maison de retraite</i> at Ch&acirc;teauvieux, on the edge of Wrestler's former fighting area. She masterminded the erection of a memorial to F section's dead at Valen&ccedil;ay (Indre), inaugurated by the queen mother in 1991 on the fiftieth anniversary of F section's first parachute drop, not far away. In 1996, in collaboration with a French journalist, Herv&eacute; Larroque, she published her autobiography, <span class="italic">Pauline</span>. She was a woman of unusual strength of character, courage, and directness of speech. Henri died at Ch&acirc;teauvieux in 1999; she died there on 24 February 2008. She was survived by her daughter.<br>
