<span class="headword">Prout,  John</span>  (1810&#150;1894), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born on 1 October 1810 at South Petherwin, near Launceston, Cornwall, the son of William Prout, farmer, and his wife (also his cousin), Tomazin Prout. John was educated at a school in Launceston. He gained practical experience of farming by working for his father. Dissatisfied with the position of a tenant farmer on the smallholdings of his native land, and with the antiquated restrictions of land tenure, he emigrated to Canada and purchased land at Pickering, Ontario, which he farmed from 1832 to 1842. Having married, about 1841, Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1893), niece of Colonel Thomson of Aikenshaw, Toronto, Prout returned to England, and joined his uncle, Thomas Prout, a medicine vendor and performer, in business at 229 Strand, London. On the death of his uncle, Prout carried on the business. In 1861 he bought Blount's Farm, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, which he cultivated until June 1894.<br>
<br>Prout helped to pioneer the adoption of scientific farming by his thirty-three years' successful cultivation of Blount's Farm, and his experience was valuable to agriculturists not only in Britain but also in other countries. His system was based on his Canadian experience and his study of Sir John Lawes's experimental plots at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire. He demonstrated that successive crops of cereals could be produced on land of heavy clay with the use of artificial fertilizer, if the soil was adequately drained and cultivated. In 1881 he published a report of his methods, entitled <span class="italic">Profitable Clay Farming under a Just System of Tenant Right</span>, which ran to several editions and was translated into French and German. His text helped to popularize the adoption of a more scientific approach to the problems of arable farming, particularly on heavy soils.<br>
<br>Prout died while living with his married daughter at Wimbish vicarage, Saffron Walden, Essex, on 7 December 1894. His wife had died the previous year.<br>
