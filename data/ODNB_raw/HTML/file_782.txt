<span class="headword">Ashurst,  Henry</span>  (1616?&#150;1680), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the third son of Henry Ashurst (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1645), gentleman, of Dalton, Lancashire, and Cassandra, daughter of John Bradshaw of Bradshaw, Lancashire. Ashurst's family had proved a bastion of the protestant faith since the late sixteenth century, his grandfather William lauded as &#145;soundly affected in religion&#146;  (Powicke, 309), and his father, Henry, described as &#145;a gentleman of great wisdom and piety, and zealous for the true reformed religion in a country where papists much abounded&#146;  (Baxter, 36). Henry senior evidently inspired his sons to embrace both religion and public service, for his eldest, William, served as MP for Newton in the Long Parliament and for Lancashire in the first protectorate parliament; while the second son, John, was an officer in the parliamentarian army, and became governor of Liverpool.<br>
<br>Although uncertainty still surrounds Ashurst's birth date, his friend Richard Baxter records that Ashurst was fifteen when he gained an apprenticeship in 1631 under draper Thomas Torbocke of Watling Street, London. The tyranny of his master was later credited as one of the principal reasons for his turn to serious religion, for he went &#145;to hear good preachers for his comfort&#146;, and alleviated the miseries of his dank cellar accommodation by prayer and meditation  (ibid., 37). Having survived such hardship, he set himself up in partnership with a draper, helped by the Presbyterian minister Simeon Ash. However, although his partner left to help the parliamentarian war effort, Ashurst remained in the capital, being &#145;ever against tumults, sedition and rebellion&#146;  (ibid., 49). In or before 1643 he married Judith (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1690), daughter of William Reresby of London, a match which brought him a dowry of &pound;1500, and produced at least four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Although Ashurst later settled in suburban Clapton, in Hackney, he maintained a lifelong association with the ward of Bread Street, and first entered civic life as one of its common councilmen between 1657 and 1662. However, after the passage of the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span>, which debarred dissenters from public office, his Presbyterian beliefs effectively curtailed his rise up the corporate ladder. In response to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> he tried to co-ordinate provision for poor ejected ministers, and from 1662 donated an annual &pound;100 for those of his native Lancashire. He also organized aid for victims of the great fire of 1666, and he contributed towards the building of a conventicle in Oxenden Street, thereby further establishing his credentials as one of the leading dissenters in Restoration London. He was elected an alderman in July 1668, but probably as part of a familiar design to extract money from nonconformists, since he fined to leave office two days later. Despite such reluctance to serve he was sometimes referred to thereafter as &#145;Alderman Ashurst&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 620). He did continue to progress in the Merchant Taylors' Company, however, becoming an assistant in 1667, and serving as master in 1670&#150;71. Ever keen to advance the cause of his co-religionists, he took full advantage of Charles II's declaration of indulgence in 1672, successfully petitioning for a licence to hold Presbyterian services in his Clapton home.<br>
<br>Ashurst won greatest distinction for his charitable works, renowned as &#145;the famousest person in the City, who purposely addicted himself to works of mercy&#146;  (Sylvester, 3.17&#150;18). Probably his most important achievement was the re-establishment of the New England Company, which he served as treasurer from 1659 to his death, thereby aiding the conversion of the Native Americans. His sons also played a major role in its affairs after his death, and his close contact with its governor Robert Boyle was reflected by his appointment as a trustee of Boyle's lecture. Among the many divines he counted as friends were Henry Newcome, Matthew Henry, and Richard Baxter, the last of whom preached his funeral sermon, in which Ashurst was praised for having set a truly Christian example, and for always displaying &#145;a humble meekness and sweetness of temper&#146;  (Baxter, 37). His philanthropy was also recognized, and among the many beneficiaries of his will were Christ's Hospital, and 100 poor Londoners, none of whom were to be &#145;begging poor, but such as have been of sober and honest conversation&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/364/159).<br>
<br>Ashurst died on 16 November 1680, having suffered &#145;the terrible disease of the stone in the bladder&#146;  (Sylvester, 3.189). Shortly before his death he vowed &#145;to set upon as many Parliament men he could speak with to repeal all the laws which hinder good men from preaching Christ's gospel&#146;  (Baxter, 56&#150;7), but, although his influence was regarded with concern by secretary of state Sir Leoline Jenkins as late as August 1680, he never was given the chance to play this more forceful role. He was buried on 1 December at St Augustine, Watling Street; his wife and at least five children outlived him. His will bears testimony to his success in trade, for he left over &pound;6000 in bequests, and annuities totalling over &pound;500 a year. As he would have wished, his sons emulated him as pillars of the nonconformist community in the capital. Henry, the eldest, became a baronet in 1688, and served as MP for Truro and Wilton. He also established the family at Waterstock, Oxfordshire, on lands which his father had bequeathed. William, the second son, gained a knighthood in 1687, and was later elected as lord mayor and member for London. The marriage of his daughter Mary to Thomas Lane, a future knight and lord mayor, gave further proof of his family's standing in the City.<br>
