<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Strafford  (1593&#150;1641), <span class="occ">lord lieutenant of Ireland</span>, was born on Good Friday, 13 April 1593, in a house in Chancery Lane, London, which belonged to his grandfather Robert Atkinson, a barrister of the Inner Temple. He was baptized on 22 April at St Dunstan-in-the-West. He was the second and eldest surviving son of William Wentworth (1562&#150;1614) of Wentworth Woodhouse, a wealthy Yorkshire landowner, whose family had long been settled in the southern part of the West Riding, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1611), daughter and heir of Sir Robert Atkinson of Stowell in Gloucestershire. William Wentworth was made first baronet in 1611. His ancestors included the Nevills of Westmorland and the fifteenth-century judge Sir William Gascoigne of Gawthorpe, and Thomas himself always took great pride in belonging to a house which in wealth and lineage equalled many families raised to the peerage in the sixteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Wentworth was educated at first by the dean of Ripon, Dr Higgins, in his house at Well. His fellow pupils included Henry, Lord Clifford, eldest son of the earl of Cumberland, and Christopher Wandesford, both close friends in later years. In November 1607 he entered the Inner Temple in London and in Easter term 1609 he matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, where Richard Senhouse, later bishop of Carlisle, was his tutor. On 22 October 1611 he married Lady Margaret Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1622), eldest daughter of Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland, at Londesborough, her father's seat. In December 1611, having been knighted by the king on 6 December at Royston, Wentworth left England for France to complete his education. He travelled widely and visited among other places Paris, Orl&eacute;ans, Bordeaux, and Saumur. He learned not only French but also&#151;to a lesser extent&#151;Italian and Spanish, and read a number of works fashionable at the time, such as Justus Lipsius's letters. After returning early in 1613 he became the head of his family and inherited the title of baronet through his father's death in September 1614. He now had an annual income of about &pound;4000 at his disposal but was also saddled with the responsibility for the education and career of his eight younger brothers.<br>
<br>Earlier in 1614 Wentworth had been elected one of the knights of the shire for Yorkshire (the other knight was Sir John Savile, soon to become his inveterate enemy) and represented his county in the so-called Addled Parliament in April 1614. Although he hardly raised his voice in the debates of this short-lived parliament two draft speeches among his papers testify to his attempt to reconcile the interests of king and country. In December 1615 Wentworth was appointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> (keeper of the records) for the West Riding of Yorkshire. Savile, his predecessor in this office, had been forced to step down after having been ordered to appear before the court of Star Chamber to answer charges of fraud and intimidation. Apparently Savile himself suggested Wentworth as his successor on the assumption that a young man like Wentworth could easily be made to resign once Savile had managed to mend his reputation. Savile had, however, misjudged Wentworth's character. When George Villiers, the earl of Buckingham, with whom Savile had in the meantime successfully managed to ingratiate himself, asked Wentworth to resign as <i>custos</i> in September 1617 Wentworth refused, arguing that such a demand was an attack on his honour as a gentleman; &#145;Itt might justly be taken as the greatest disgrace that could be done unto me&#146;, he wrote to Buckingham  (Gardiner, <span class="italic">Fortescue Papers</span>, 26). He even denied knowledge of the fact that Savile had nominated him his successor. Buckingham withdrew his request for Wentworth's resignation, but the latter's relations with the ever more powerful royal favourite never quite recovered from the repercussions of this incident. Moreover, Wentworth now found himself involved in a bitter feud with Savile and his family, which was to last for more than a decade until Savile's death in 1630, and beyond.<h2>
<a name="Courtcountyandparliamentintheearly1620s"></a>Court, county, and parliament in the early 1620s</h2>Wentworth was aware that he could prevail against Savile only if he managed to gain influence at court as well as in Yorkshire. At court his principal contacts about 1620 were Sir George Calvert, one of the two secretaries of state, and Sir Arthur Ingram, a London merchant, financier, and customs farmer of dubious reputation who was also a substantial landowner in his native Yorkshire. Wentworth, who now spent long periods of time in London, could also count to some extent on the patronage of the new lord treasurer appointed in September 1621, Lionel Cranfield, contacts with whom had been established by Ingram. In December 1620 Wentworth sought election as knight of the shire for Yorkshire with Calvert as a fellow candidate. In spite of strong opposition by Savile, who stood as a candidate himself, Wentworth and Calvert were elected, although the election was later (unsuccessfully) challenged in the House of Commons; Wentworth and his supporters were, probably not without some justification, alleged to have exerted undue pressure on the voters. In parliament Wentworth tried to mediate between the king and those who saw the crown's policy as a threat to the privileges of parliament and the ancient liberties of the king's subjects. Totally out of sympathy with those who tried to urge the king to pursue a more active anti-Spanish foreign policy, he discouraged the house from debating foreign affairs while at the same time defending the privilege of free speech. It was probably Wentworth who first suggested that the Commons should not only investigate the controversial monopoly patents granted by the crown but instigate proceedings to have the patentees punished by parliamentary judicature. During the spring and summer recess of 1621 Wentworth turned to his voters to explain the stance he had taken in Westminster and to reassure himself of their support. He spoke at Rotherham on 23 April emphasizing the &#145;harmonious union betwixt the kinge, the nobles and Commons&#146; which he hoped for if the parliament were to achieve its real objective, successful legislation  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 153&#150;5). When parliament met once more in the autumn he implored his fellow knights and burgesses not to enter too deeply into disputes about their privileges and the king's prerogative. Their liberties, he argued in a draft speech of 23 November 1621, would be much safer if they remained &#145;wrapte up in a sacred and questionable doubtfulnesse&#146; instead of being unravelled by an &#145;over precise curiosity&#146;  (ibid., 164, cf. 166).<br>
<br>After the dissolution of parliament Wentworth tried to strengthen his contacts with the court. In April 1622 Lord Treasurer Cranfield offered him the receivership of crown lands in Yorkshire. He passed this office on, however, to a successor about a year later and it is possible that Wentworth resigned under political pressure. His standing at court was certainly not secure during these years, although the new lord president of the council of the north, Lord Scrope, had nominated him as a member of the council on 10 July 1619. Moreover, there were rumours in 1622 that he would be made comptroller of the household and be raised to the peerage. Nothing came of this; during the years 1622&#150;4 Wentworth was often seriously ill, and was forced to give up his London residence.<br>
<br>The death of his wife, Margaret, on 14 August 1622 marked a crisis in Wentworth's life. His marriage had been childless and it had not been marked at first by great passion, but he was nevertheless deeply afflicted by Margaret's death. During her fatal illness he prayed with her and read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> to her, as the detailed account of her death which he subsequently gave testifies; the religious sensibility which he displayed at this moment was clearly influenced by strictly protestant ideals. According to the biographical account by his friend Sir George Radcliffe, at moments of crisis Wentworth was no stranger to the religious self-examination which is often seen as typical for a particularly puritan variety of religious fervour, although he clearly did not share the wider political outlook associated with puritanism. After his wife's death Wentworth led a more withdrawn life than before. When he recovered his health and mental strength in the spring of 1624 the political scene had changed, becoming decidedly more unfavourable to his ambitions. The deterioration of relations with Spain made open war with the house of Habsburg (always rejected by Wentworth as pointless and dangerous) more than likely. At the same time the influence of his patron Cranfield, himself an opponent of war, was rapidly declining: parliament impeached the lord treasurer and forced him to resign in 1624. Wentworth represented the borough of Pontefract in parliament in 1624. He had not contested the election for the county seats of Yorkshire, and Savile and his son took both those seats unopposed. In the Commons Wentworth spoke cautiously and not without reservations in defence of Cranfield and against the contentious impositions. He also voiced his enthusiasm for action against recusants, but in general did not play a very prominent part in the proceedings of the parliament.<h2>
<a name="Politicalandpersonaldisappointments16251626"></a>Political and personal disappointments, 1625&#150;1626</h2>Although Wentworth did not entirely give up his hope of finding favour at court he was about to enter into a closer alliance with men who were strongly opposed to the king's favourite, the (now) duke of Buckingham, and his policies. As Wentworth's enemy Savile was supported by the duke, it was natural for Wentworth to canvass the support of all those who rejected Buckingham's warlike foreign policy and especially the burdens with which it was likely to saddle the country&#151;all the more so as he genuinely believed this policy foolish. Personal attachments and connections drew Wentworth into the camp of those increasingly critical of official royal policy in the early years of Charles I's reign. After Margaret's death he looked for a new wife, if possible an heiress. Mary, daughter of the City magnate Sir William Craven, Lady Diana Cecil, daughter of the earl of Exeter's heir, and the dowager countess of Dorset were all wooed with varying degrees of intensity, but in the end Wentworth made suit for Lady Arabella Holles (1608/9&#150;1631), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13554/', "John Holles, first earl of Clare (d. 1637)")</script>, one of the richest landowners in Nottinghamshire. Arabella was a strikingly beautiful girl of sixteen and Wentworth seems to have fallen passionately in love with her. They married on 24 February 1625. Wentworth's new father-in-law had strong links with Bishop Williams of Lincoln, the lord keeper, who, however, lost his office shortly after Charles's accession. The earl of Clare, disappointed in his hopes for advancement, came to take an increasingly critical view of royal policy, and became a leader of the opposition to Buckingham in the House of Lords after 1625.<br>
<br>In the elections for Charles I's first parliament in 1625 Wentworth again sought to obtain one of the county seats for Yorkshire, with Sir Thomas Fairfax as his running mate. The elections were hotly contested, as Savile had mobilized the weavers of Leeds and Halifax to defeat Wentworth. At the height of the turmoil on polling day the high sheriff, Sir Richard Cholmondeley, closed the poll and declared Wentworth and Fairfax elected. This decision was questioned in the Commons when parliament met. While the house debated the validity of the election Wentworth took his seat, a breach of the rules of procedure. He thereby provoked the anger of Sir John Eliot, who was speaking at that very moment, although Eliot's later account of this incident in which he claimed that he had denounced Wentworth immediately as a Catilina&#151;the Roman revolutionary defeated by Cicero&#151;is of questionable authenticity. The Commons did indeed declare the election invalid, but Wentworth returned to parliament in early August 1625 having been re-elected by a clear majority of the voters.<br>
<br>Although Wentworth, who still hoped to find favour with the duke, refrained from openly attacking Buckingham in parliament, he felt to some extent &#145;obliged to be obstructive&#146; because he was aware that too much compliance could lose him credit in his native Yorkshire  (Salt, 155&#150;6). He thus opposed the granting of further supply on 12 August until the two subsidies already granted had been fully collected. Nevertheless, he saw the king's decision, taken on Buckingham's advice, to have him appointed sheriff of Yorkshire in November 1625, with the intention of rendering him incapable of sitting in the next parliament, as a mark of disfavour which he had done nothing to provoke. In fact, his association with Bishop Williams and Archbishop Abbot, as well as with the earl of Arundel and to a lesser extent the earl of Pembroke, may have been responsible for Buckingham's desire to keep him out of parliament, as well as Savile's efforts to depict him at court as a dangerous troublemaker. Undeterred, the following spring Wentworth applied for the office of lord president of the north, which he thought would become vacant through the resignation of Lord Scrope. However, Scrope held on to his office, and, even more galling for Wentworth, his enemy Savile was subsequently appointed vice-president. Worse was to come. In July 1626 Wentworth was ordered to relinquish the office of <i>custos rotulorum</i>, which he had held since 1615, and was dismissed from the commission of the peace. He was deeply disappointed, as he believed that he had come to an understanding with Buckingham during a visit to Whitehall about Easter 1626 and that he had even contracted a &#145;friendship&#146; with the favourite  (<span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 1.34&#150;5). This disgrace and humiliation affected him even more deeply, as he was notified of his dismissal while presiding over a session of the commission of the peace.<h2>
<a name="Thehonestpatriot16271628"></a>The &#145;honest patriot&#146;, 1627&#150;1628</h2>Although Wentworth tried to remain true to the principle of not contending &#145;with the prerogative out of Parliament, nor yet to contest with a King but when I am constrained thereunto&#146;  (letter to Wandesford, 5 Dec 1625, <span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 1.32), he was inexorably drawn towards a more radical position. The fact that Savile had been appointed comptroller of the household in 1627 and now dominated contacts between Yorkshire and the court left Wentworth little choice but to ally himself even more openly than before with those opposed to the king's favourite and his policies. In fact many of his closest friends and relations, for example, Wandesford, Radcliffe, and Clare, were among the most outspoken critics of royal policy during these years. When faced with a demand to pay the forced loan raised to finance the war against France in 1626&#150;7 Wentworth refused, although he clearly hesitated to commit himself irrevocably to a conflict with the crown. Summoned to appear before the privy council he pleaded illness. In the end, however, he stood his ground and was committed to the Marshalsea prison in June 1627. Wentworth seems to have shared the concern of many of his friends about the grave constitutional implications of the forced loan, and if he did not want to lose all credit with his fellow Yorkshiremen he probably had little choice but to refuse to pay regardless of his convictions. However, he was careful not to do or say anything that would preclude eventual reconciliation with the king and his advisers. He was transferred from the Marshalsea to Dartford prison six weeks after his imprisonment and was finally released on 27 December, having petitioned the king in November to be allowed out of confinement to attend business.<br>
<br>In 1628 Wentworth was once more elected as a knight of the shire to represent Yorkshire in parliament. His position as an acknowledged martyr for the cause of the liberties of the subject in itself ensured that he played a leading role in the proceedings of this parliament. On 22 March he spoke to the house asking them to vindicate &#145;our ancient, sober, vital liberties&#146; in a speech that already contained much of the substance of the future petition of right  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 2.60). Wentworth, like others, however, insisted that only a proper law, not a mere petition, could safeguard the king's subjects against any future infringement of their rights, so that &#145;his Majesty's goodness&#146; in promising to respect his subjects' traditional liberties in future would &#145;remain to posterity&#146; enshrined in a public act of state  (ibid., 2 May 1628, 3.211). Only very reluctantly did Wentworth accept the proposal to proceed by petition. At the same time, however, he continued to advocate the ideal of harmony between the crown and its subjects. He preferred to assume that only misguided advice had led the king to raise the forced loan, and expressed his hope that &#145;it shall never be stirred here whether the King be above the law or the law above the King&#146;  (ibid., 26 April 1628, 3.98). Wentworth was aware that only adequate financial resources would enable the king to govern in accordance with the law and tradition, and that any further refusal to grant him tonnage and poundage&#151;even after a bill or petition of right had been passed&#151;would only force the king to raise revenues by means incompatible with the letter of the law.<br>
<br>There was, therefore, always room for compromise with the political forces dominant at court, in particular as Wentworth, even while in open conflict with official policy, had never adopted the rhetoric of violent anti-popery so popular with other leaders of opposition to an allegedly arbitrary government. Wentworth's moderation, based in part on a much more secular conception of politics than that of many contemporaries, now proved a valuable asset, as Charles I and Buckingham, concentrating on the war effort against France, had decided to seek peace with Spain. Buckingham tried to bring about a reconciliation with a number of influential proponents of a pro-Spanish policy after the parliament of 1628 and as part of this political reshuffle Wentworth was elevated to the peerage as Baron Wentworth of Wentworth Woodhouse and baron of Newmarch and Oversley on 22 July 1628. Sir Richard Weston, the recently appointed lord treasurer, had acted as a mediator between Wentworth and the favourite. However, the fact that Wentworth's old enemy Savile was created Baron Savile of Pomfret on the previous day indicates that the outcome of the contest for favour at court remained open, as long as Buckingham dominated the king's entourage. As Wentworth had played such a prominent part in leading the resistance to the forced loan and in the struggle for the petition of right his apparent change of sides was immediately commented on and seen as controversial. His friend Wandesford testified that in Yorkshire common opinion was now passing him &#145;under Sir John Savile's character, and that there is a Thomas as well as a John for the king&#146;  (Wandesford to Wentworth, 30 July 1628, Cooper, <span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 301). However, Wentworth had always with considerable consistency, though not with equal success, tried to act as a mediator between his county and the court: it was, therefore, not altogether surprising that he accepted advancement and office once the most blatant local and national grievances outside the religious sphere, which did not greatly preoccupy him, had to all appearances been redressed.<h2>
<a name="InofficeatlastWentworthaslordpresidentofthenorth"></a>In office at last: Wentworth as lord president of the north</h2>Buckingham's death in August 1628 and Charles I's decision to end the war against France as well as the struggle against Spain removed the last obstacles to Wentworth's advancement. On 13 December 1628 he was created Viscount Wentworth and on 25 December Charles appointed him lord president of the north in Scrope's place. At the same time Savile, accused of having accepted bribes from recusants, was removed from office as vice-president. Finally on 10 November 1629 Wentworth was made a privy councillor. The delay between his appointment as lord president and his entry into the privy council may indicate that the king did not yet entirely trust him. However, later accounts, though uncorroborated by official records, maintain that Wentworth was sworn in as a privy councillor only after he had brought to the king's attention a libellous tract which was in essence a blueprint for arbitrary government by an absolute monarch. The tract had apparently been distributed with the intention of discrediting Charles by creating the impression that he wanted to govern permanently without parliament. Wentworth's father-in-law, Clare, was among those who had read and possibly circulated the tract and now faced prosecution in Star Chamber for conspiracy. Whatever Wentworth's part in this incident, his relations with his in-laws certainly deteriorated at this time. In fact they had already been strained before this incident, as Denzil Holles, one of Clare's sons, had been involved in the fracas which led to the dissolution of parliament in 1629 and was subsequently imprisoned while his brother-in-law was promoted by the king.<br>
<br>On taking up his office as president, Wentworth, in a speech delivered to the council of the north, had again enunciated his political philosophy, stressing the old theme of harmony between the king and his subjects and condemning those who wanted to create a division between the two. In practice, however, the ruthlessness and vindictiveness which he demonstrated in his new office did little to foster the political harmony which he so often praised as his highest political ideal. By nature a man who believed in the need for strong authority he had, once in office, little sympathy for those who saw royal policy as a threat to long-established legal and constitutional traditions. He had, indeed, shared some of those concerns in the 1620s, but then England had been involved in an apparently futile war fundamentally undermining the country's traditional constitutional framework.<br>
<br>As lord president, Wentworth immediately filled positions in the council and in the commission of the peace with his supporters, including Wandesford, Sir George Radcliffe (who became the king's attorney for the council), Sir John Hotham, Sir William Constable, and Sir Thomas Hoby. Moreover, he used the authority of his office to thwart the interests of his old opponents. Thus a scheme for draining Hatfield Chase promoted by Sir Cornelius Vermuyden and supported by the Savile family was systematically obstructed by Wentworth. In this case concern for the many smallholders who would have lost their land or grazing rights probably motivated Wentworth's action as much as enmity to the Saviles, but for his opponents personal animosities and higher political purpose were difficult to distinguish. As receiver of recusant fines in the north, an office in which he had succeeded Savile in June 1629, Wentworth increased the fiscal pressure on Catholic landowners who did not lack influence and friends in some parts of Yorkshire. In fact, his appointment as lord president had greatly disturbed Catholics in northern England, as the new president was known to be less tolerant than his predecessor&#151;&#145;the Papists already hang down their heads like bulrushes&#146;, as his friend Wandesford put it  (<span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 1.49). However, as Wentworth was used to living among a sizeable Catholic minority his anti-Catholicism always remained more pragmatic and less fanatical than that of many fervent protestants from a different background.<br>
<br>Even so, opponents who openly challenged Wentworth's authority in Yorkshire were harshly punished and humiliated. Sir Henry Bellasis, the son of Thomas, Lord Fauconberg, was imprisoned by the privy council and had to apologize publicly for not having shown the lord president proper respect during a session of the council of the north. While Wentworth energetically collected the knighthood fines which were to bolster Charles I's revenues, James Maleverer, a Yorkshire puritan, and Sir David Foulis, himself a member of the council of the north, tried to organize local resistance to the scheme. In 1632 Foulis accused Wentworth of having misappropriated the funds which he had collected as lord president. Wentworth was furious and on his insistence Foulis was not only dismissed from the council in 1633, but was heavily fined and imprisoned.<br>
<br>Wentworth was hardly universally popular as lord president but he undoubtedly strengthened the authority of the council, which had declined under his predecessors. He deliberately emphasized the importance of his office by insisting on a great deal of pomp and ceremony when appearing in public in his official capacity and by embarking upon an extensive building programme which, among other projects, transformed the king's manor in York into a residence worthy of the monarch's representative in the north. In March 1633 the king confirmed Wentworth's success by issuing a new commission and instructions for the council which brought its powers into line with those of the Star Chamber in the south.<br>
<br>The years following Wentworth's elevation to the peerage brought him success and prosperity. However, the death of his wife on 5 October 1631 was a major personal setback. While pregnant, Arabella had had a fall which brought on a premature confinement. She did not survive, and Wentworth felt this personal disaster all the more deeply because his wife's family held him responsible for her death as it was he who had asked her to travel in spite of her pregnancy. Rumours even accused him of having struck her, thus causing the accident. Together they had had four children, of whom three survived: William (1626&#150;1695), Ann (<i>b</i>. 1627), and Arabella (<i>b</i>. 1630); a second son, Thomas, died as an infant in 1631. In spite of his grief at Arabella's death Wentworth soon married again, in October 1632. His third wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1614&#150;1688), daughter of Sir Godfrey Rodes of Great Houghton in Yorkshire, came from a strongly puritan family and was about eighteen at the time of the marriage. The fact that the ceremony took place in secret and that Wentworth did not publicly acknowledge her as his wife until about a year after the wedding may indicate that he feared public reproach for having married again so soon. This marriage resulted in the birth of a daughter, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1681).<h2>
<a name="PromotionorbanishmentAppointmentaslorddeputyofIreland"></a>Promotion or banishment? Appointment as lord deputy of Ireland</h2>At the time of his third marriage Wentworth was about to take up a new office, the position of lord deputy of Ireland. When his appointment was first debated in the summer of 1631, there was no lack of advice warning him against abandoning England for Ireland. One of Wentworth's friends, Sir Edward Stanhope, pointed out in September 1631 that the deputyship had always been &#145;a fatall place to pack men of eminancy into &hellip; for their overthrowe&#146;  (Zagorin, 315). Wentworth would have no clients or friends to rely on in Ireland, in contrast to his native Yorkshire. If he were to tackle the difficult problem of alienated royal rights and titles he would provoke uncontrollable animosity, not least among the influential protestant planters. Thus the problems that awaited a new lord deputy were clearly visible. Moreover, Wentworth was probably aware that Weston, the lord treasurer, and Lord Cottington, the chancellor of the exchequer, who were primarily responsible for the king's decision to offer him the deputyship in July 1631, though officially his friends, both saw him as a potential rival who could do less harm in Ireland than in England. Nevertheless, Wentworth clearly welcomed what he saw as an important promotion and eagerly accepted the position. Apparently he believed that he could govern Ireland as successfully as northern England, provided he had the king's full support. In fact he laid down a number of conditions, to which he asked the king to agree before he accepted the new office: he should be allowed to return to England and attend the court whenever he saw fit to do so; no grant relating to Ireland was to be made without his knowledge and consent; and the king was not to allow any appeals against his decisions unless a manifest perversion of justice could be demonstrated. Wentworth also expressed a wish to be created an earl before he left for Ireland but this wish, as opposed to his other demands, was denied. However, he was allowed to retain his office as lord president of the north and could delegate the actual functions of the office to his vice-president, Sir Edward Osborne, a wealthy Yorkshire landowner who enjoyed Wentworth's total confidence. Wentworth was appointed lord deputy on 12 January 1632 but did not leave England for Ireland until July 1633. This delay gave him the chance to sort matters out in Dublin through his political allies and agents, while still being able to exert personal influence on decisions in England, a vital precondition for not being outmanoeuvred at court by possible opponents before he had even taken up office.<br>
<br>It was clear from the outset that Wentworth's appointment as lord deputy was intended to be a new start for the government of Ireland. As early as 1623 a royal commission sent to Dublin to examine the problems facing church and state in Ireland had revealed how far the king had been defrauded of income and property by his own office-holders. The commission's report had strongly advised, among other things, the re-endowment of the church because ecclesiastical property had been alienated on a large scale to laymen, mostly New English protestants. None of the commissioners' recommendations could really be implemented in the following years, but when peace with Spain was restored in 1630 the situation was more favourable and Wentworth was determined to make the most of this chance. He clearly mistrusted the class of protestant office-holders and planters (the New English) whom he found in power when he came to Ireland in 1633: &#145;I find myself in the society of a strange people, their owne privates altogether their study without regard to the publique&#146;  (Wentworth to Arundel, 19 Aug 1633, Wentworth Woodhouse muniments, Strafford papers, 8, fol. 11<i>r</i>). Wentworth deliberately antagonized vested interests in Ireland, including those of the protestants, confident that he need not care whom he pleased or displeased as long as he retained the support of the king. The problem of Catholicism was to be seen in a long-term perspective. The Catholic church was to be vanquished not by direct persecution but on one hand by a new series of plantations which would weaken Catholic landowners and bring new English settlers to Ireland, and on the other by a reform and financial re-endowment of the established church which would enable it to pursue its mission in Ireland successfully. To seek religious conformity without such prior internal ecclesiastical reforms would be to act &#145;as a man going to warfare without munitions or arms&#146;  (letter to Laud, 31 Jan 1634, <span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 1.187).<br>
<br>Even before Wentworth left England for Ireland he had prepared the ground for his administration in close co-operation with Francis Annesley, Lord Mountnorris, the Irish vice-treasurer, who had travelled to England to defend himself against accusations of administrative malpractice. In the past Mountnorris, who had many friends at the English court but had remained an outsider among the New English office-holders in Ireland, had often acted as a check on the Dublin administration on behalf of the king and his councillors. In the period between Wentworth's appointment and actual arrival in Dublin, Mountnorris proved a valuable ally for the new deputy.<br>
<br>Prior to Wentworth's arrival the dominant faction in the Irish privy council led by Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork, the richest planter in Ireland and one of the two acting lords justices, tried to tie the new deputy's hands by pursuing a policy of more active persecution against Catholics. The fines for recusancy were to be strictly enforced and were to replace the contribution which the Catholic and protestant landowners alike had agreed to pay in 1628 to finance the army. Had Cork and his allies been able to implement this policy, Wentworth would have found even a limited and temporary co-operation with the Catholic Old English impossible. He would instead have remained dependent on the New English like his immediate predecessors. However, Wentworth entered into negotiations with the Catholic peerage and gentry. Under the threat of renewed persecution the leaders of the Old English agreed in December 1632 to extend for another year the payment of the contribution they had granted in 1628 and which was due to cease at the end of 1632. Later this contribution was further extended until December 1634. This gave Wentworth the necessary breathing-space to find other means (in the form of parliamentary grants and an improved income from the customs) to finance the army and other expenditure.<h2>
<a name="Newfoundationsparliamentstateandchurch"></a>New foundations: parliament, state, and church</h2>When Wentworth finally arrived in Dublin on 23 July 1633 he had already formed a clear opinion of the problems awaiting him, and also to some extent of the men who dominated the Dublin administration. It is therefore not surprising that in his early reports from Ireland he found fault with almost everything he saw: the army, neglected by its absentee officers, ill-trained, insufficiently armed, and incapable of fighting; the church, without resources and with ecclesiastical benefices in the hands of badly paid clergy without a proper education who neglected their flocks; and the crown's finances in disarray, thanks not least to the cavalier attitude or downright corruption of the king's own office-holders. With great energy and determination, which he never failed to present to the king and his councillors in the most favourable light, Wentworth set out to put these matters right. Among his first priorities were the army and navy, the latter essential to protect shipping and trade, the former an indispensable instrument for enforcing his orders against those who sought to resist him. Characteristically Wentworth, ever conscious of his own honour and the dignity of his office, also sought from the outset to transform his own entourage in Dublin into a quasi-royal court.<br>
<br>Most important in Wentworth's eyes, however, was an improvement in the state of the Irish revenues. Only if the income from these revenues produced a substantial and steady surplus could he guard Ireland against intervention from England, as he clearly desired, and realize his own political objectives. The foundations for a sound financial policy were to be laid by a generous grant of parliamentary taxation. Wentworth therefore asked the king in January 1634 for permission to convene the Irish houses of parliament; parliament met on 14 July 1634 and the first session lasted until 2 August of that year. A second session was held between November and December 1634, and a third from January to April 1635. The first session, in which Wentworth deliberately played protestants off against Catholics and vice versa, was a great success. This was made possible not least by the large number of candidates elected to the House of Commons who owed their seats to official patronage. In July parliament granted six subsidies, a very considerable sum by Irish standards. This grant was made all the more valuable as each subsidy was fixed at &pound;40,000. Thus attempts to evade taxes by underassessing one's wealth (a common practice in England) were rendered largely futile. In fact, the richest man in Ireland, the earl of Cork, who had become accustomed to paying no taxes at all, later complained that he paid such a considerable sum in subsidies after 1634 that it would have been sufficient to &#145;have ransomed me if I had been prisoner with the turkes&#146;  (Grosart, 2.4, p. 186).<br>
<br>In the second session of parliament, which first met on 4 November 1634, it became clear that Wentworth was not prepared to have the &#145;graces&#146; of 1628 confirmed without major modifications. The graces were a catalogue of concessions which the king had made during the war against Spain and France to protestants and Catholics alike. They were, however, of particular importance to the Old English landowners as they gave them security of tenure. Until November, Wentworth had deliberately created the impression that all the graces would eventually be confirmed. Late in November, however, he could no longer conceal the fact that only a limited number would be given force of law by statute, while others would be implemented only at the deputy's discretion, and those confirming titles predating the completion of the Elizabethan conquest not at all. At this stage, however, Wentworth commanded sufficient financial resources for a number of years and no longer needed the co-operation of the Old English. In spite of some minor setbacks he was able to steer most of his legislative programme successfully through parliament with protestant support.<br>
<br>The Irish convocation met at the same time as parliament. With the help of his closest assistant in ecclesiastical affairs, Bishop John Bramhall, who had originally accompanied him as his personal chaplain from Yorkshire to Ireland before being promoted to the see of Derry, the lord deputy managed convocation as successfully as parliament. A set of canons was passed by the assembled clergy which brought the Church of Ireland much more into line with the Church of England and with the peculiar ecclesiastical aspirations of Archbishop Laud. In fact, throughout the 1630s Wentworth and Laud co-operated closely in fighting for a political and ecclesiastical programme in Ireland and England respectively for which they used the catchword &#145;thorough&#146; as opposed to the laxer approach favoured by Lord Treasurer Portland or the chancellor of the exchequer, Cottington. Wentworth may not have shared Laud's personal religious sentiments&#151;his enthusiasm for the &#145;beauty of holiness&#146; and his concern for the continuity between the Church of England and the pre-Reformation universal church, let alone his alleged Arminianism&#151;but like Laud he was convinced that secular and ecclesiastical authority stood or fell together. Those who attacked the one committed as much of a crime against God as those who attacked the other. In fact, like Laud, Wentworth was convinced that to rob the established church of her rightful property and to undermine her dignity and authority was tantamount to sacrilege. In their concern for order and discipline and their conviction that the church and the clerical order had to be restored to their pristine splendour Laud and Wentworth were of one mind, different as their personal religious sensibilities and theological convictions may have been. United in their zeal for authoritarian reform, for a policy of &#145;thorough&#146;, Laud and Wentworth became close allies in the 1630s and it was largely due to the archbishop's influence at court that Wentworth could pursue his policy in Ireland successfully. Laud did have his reservations at times about the lord deputy's ruthlessness and his quest for personal profit, but the two men's alliance withstood the test of time, although Wentworth continued to co-operate on occasions with men who had no great love for the archbishop, such as Lord Cottington.<br>
<br>In Ireland, as in England, Laud's ecclesiastical policy, which Wentworth tried to implement, was far from popular. Nevertheless, after some acrimonious debates the deputy persuaded parliament to pass a number of statutes which were designed to address the most pressing problem facing the Church of Ireland: its poverty. All bishops and clergy were forbidden in future to make leases of church lands for longer than twenty-one years to laymen. Another act made void all leases held by a minister or vicar who was absent from his cure for twelve or more weeks in the year. Thus the widespread practice by which lay owners of advowsons nominally appointed a clergyman to several benefices at the same time, while the income from the benefices remained almost totally in their own hands, became illegal. Armed with these statutes Wentworth and Bramhall could exert considerable pressure on laymen who had acquired church property or leased impropriate rectories. Faced with the possibility of a trial in the court of castle chamber, the Irish equivalent of the Star Chamber, many laymen preferred an out-of-court settlement or submitted, however grudgingly, to arbitration. Thus the financial situation of the established church improved markedly, although the success of this campaign for the re-endowment of the church was most clearly visible in the north, in the province of Armagh, where protestantism had been established only after 1603.<h2>
<a name="WentworthandtheearlofCork"></a>Wentworth and the earl of Cork</h2>Matters were more difficult in Ireland's other ecclesiastical provinces. Here greater resistance was encountered. One of the most prominent opponents of Wentworth's ecclesiastical policy was Richard Boyle, earl of Cork. Cork had arrived in Ireland in 1588 and acquired a vast fortune as a land speculator, thanks to his position as a minor official in Munster, which had provided him with valuable information about titles likely to be deemed defective by the Dublin administration. Created an earl in 1620 and elevated to the office of lord high treasurer of Ireland in 1631, his position in Ireland seemed secure before Wentworth's arrival. Nevertheless, Cork had offered the deputy the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage after the death of Wentworth's second wife; clearly this was meant to be the foundation of a lasting political alliance. Wentworth had not accepted this offer but had, however, helped to arrange a marriage between Cork's eldest son, Lord Dungarvon, and his own niece, Elizabeth Clifford. Cork included in his son's marriage portion one of his most controversial acquisitions, the lands of the former College of Youghal in Munster, an ecclesiastical corporation rich in estates and impropriate rectories. This provided him with insurance should the way in which he had acquired his enormous fortune come under closer scrutiny.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, relations between Wentworth and Cork deteriorated rapidly after the deputy's arrival in Dublin. Wentworth's portrayal of Cork in his official reports as an avaricious social upstart and a pompous hypocrite may indeed be a caricature, but there can be no doubt that Wentworth's dislike of the successful planter was genuine and went beyond a mere conflict of interests. Cork's social pretensions may have been common enough among the New English but they could easily seem ridiculous from an English perspective. Cork's enormous wealth only confirmed Wentworth in his opinion that men like the earl were to blame for the poverty of the church and crown in Ireland. He therefore decided to humiliate Cork in public by forcing him in 1634 to dismantle the enormous funeral monument which he had built for his family in the choir of St Patrick's, Dublin. The official reason for having the monument taken apart was that it stood where the high altar ought to be. But Cork was soon to undergo an even more painful ordeal. In October 1634 he had to appear before the court of castle chamber to answer charges in connection with his possession of the College of Youghal. Although Cork was eventually allowed to retain the college and its lands he was forced in April 1636 to agree to pay a fine of &pound;15,000, and to cede the rectories belonging to the college with all their revenues to the church. He had to make further concessions in 1637 with regard to the lands of the diocese of Lismore and the episcopal palace which he had acquired under very favourable but also highly questionable terms. Cork left Ireland for England in the following year. Raised to the status of privy councillor, he tried to come to an arrangement with Wentworth and did indeed manage to have his title to the lands of the College of Youghal confirmed. Both men tried to strengthen their contacts with the queen's entourage, now increasingly influential, in the late 1630s, and thus found a basis for limited co-operation. It was only in 1641, when Cork realized that Wentworth's downfall was a foregone conclusion and that the lord lieutenant's attempts to defend himself in his impeachment trial by bringing Cork's shady methods of acquiring property into the open posed a threat to himself, that the earl joined the ranks of Wentworth's enemies.<h2>
<a name="Confiscationsandplantations"></a>Confiscations and plantations</h2>The campaign for the re-endowment of the church which Wentworth and Bramhall pursued primarily affected protestant landowners. However, Wentworth's plans to confiscate vast tracts of land in areas which had not yet been planted threatened Catholic proprietors, Gaelic and Old English alike, much more than their protestant counterparts. After the parliament of 1634&#150;5 Wentworth hastened the preparations for a new plantation in Connaught. This, contrary to older plans which the earl of Cork and other office-holders had tried to put into practice before Wentworth's arrival in Ireland, was to include co. Galway, an area traditionally dominated by Old English, not Gaelic, proprietors. Overall 4000 quarters of land were to be claimed for the king in Connaught, of which 1000 were actually to be confiscated and settled by planters from England. The original owners would receive a secure title for the rest, provided that they paid the necessary fees and charges to the king.<br>
<br>The inquisitions undertaken in Roscommon, Mayo, and Sligo in the summer of 1635 went smoothly enough and the king's title to the relevant lands in these counties was established at the end of July under Wentworth's personal supervision. Matters were, however, far more difficult in co. Galway. Here the most powerful local magnate, Richard Burke, fourth earl of Clanricarde, was in the forefront of opposition to the plantation. Clanricarde lived in England, where he held the title of earl of St Albans, and where he could mobilize the support of a number of friends and relations, including his stepson, Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex. Clanricarde managed to persuade the king to receive a delegation from the Galway landowners in November 1635, but died soon afterwards. Nevertheless, a member of the delegation, the lawyer Patrick Darcy, remained active in England for some time and tried to shake the king's confidence in Wentworth's financial honesty by supplying him with damaging information about the Irish customs farm. In May 1636 Darcy was finally sent back to Ireland, where he and the other members of the Galway jury which had rejected the evidence presented by the crown's agents were thrown into prison, convicted, and each fined &pound;4000. It was not until December of that year that the jurors submitted and acknowledged the king's title to the lands claimed for the crown in co. Galway. Even after this victory for the deputy, Ulick Burke, fifth earl of Clanricarde, and heir to his father's vast estates, remained a force to be reckoned with. On good terms with Secretary Windebank and other courtiers, he gradually managed to persuade Charles I by the end of the 1630s that it was unwise to antagonize one of the most powerful Catholic noblemen in Ireland while his own authority was threatened by radical protestants in Scotland. In February 1639 Charles finally confirmed Clanricarde's titles and thereby exempted his estates from any future plantation. It was not until October 1640 that Wentworth acknowledged defeat with ill grace and accepted the king's decision. Clanricarde never forgave Wentworth and rejoiced in the thought that &#145;when Parliament doth sit, the day will come [he] shall pay for all&#146;  (Clanricarde to Windebank, 9 Oct 1640, Yorke, 2.196). The earl of Essex's pronounced hostility towards Wentworth, which played no small part in bringing about the latter's downfall and execution in 1641, may owe something to the resentment Essex felt about the harsh treatment to which his Burke relations had been subjected by the lord deputy.<br>
<br>Even without royal confirmation of Clanricarde's property rights, the plantation in co. Galway and in Connaught in general would probably have faltered. Rumours of an impending military conflict with Spain in 1637, the crisis in Scotland that came to a head in the following year, and also the fact that migration to New England now offered an attractive alternative to settlement in Ireland, made it next to impossible to find enough suitable settlers. Nor did another plantation scheme in co. Tipperary make much headway in the 1630s, although Wentworth had managed to gain the co-operation of the local magnate, the protestant earl of Ormond, one of the few members of the Irish peerage to be closely allied to him. The king's title to the baronies of upper and lower Ormond was confirmed by a jury in Clonmel in August 1637 with the earl's support. Similarly Wentworth relied on the support of Henry O'Brien, the protestant fifth earl of Thomond, for a projected plantation of co. Clare, another largely abortive project.<h2>
<a name="PublicfinanceprivateprofitandEnglishcourtpolitics"></a>Public finance, private profit, and English court politics</h2>When Wentworth first went to Ireland he had closely co-operated with the Irish vice-treasurer, Lord Mountnorris, but this association soon ended as Mountnorris controlled the considerable cash balances in the Irish exchequer, on which Wentworth himself wanted to lay his hands. Moreover, Mountnorris had a one-eighth share in the Irish customs farm. Wentworth, who considered the vice-treasurer dishonest and unreliable, and who resented the independent stance he had taken during the later sessions of the 1634&#150;5 parliament, wanted to rearrange the customs farm. The covenant which in 1632 the crown had signed with the farmers, including Mountnorris, Sir Arthur Ingram, and Wentworth himself, had proved embarrassingly disadvantageous for the king because revenue from the customs had unexpectedly risen. Previous attempts to persuade Mountnorris to resign and to withdraw from the customs farm failed. However, in the spring of 1635 Mountnorris committed an indiscretion. A kinsman of his had, perhaps deliberately, dropped a stool on Wentworth's gouty foot shortly after Mountnorris's brother, an officer in the Irish army, had been struck with a cane by the deputy during a review because of insubordination. At a dinner given by Lord Chancellor Loftus, Mountnorris declared that the pain his kinsman had inflicted on the deputy had been in revenge for Wentworth's arrogance, and that his brother might take even more drastic revenge for the insult he had received. As Mountnorris himself held a commission as a captain in the Irish army such remarks could theoretically be seen as an offence punishable by a court martial. On 31 July Wentworth received the king's permission to sentence Mountnorris according to martial law at a time of his own choosing. For the time being, however, he merely investigated Mountnorris's malpractices as vice-treasurer. Only when Mountnorris still refused to resign and began to accuse Wentworth in letters sent to the king of making huge profits out of the customs farm at the crown's cost did Wentworth finally decide to convene a court martial and had Mountnorris condemned to death on 12 December 1635. Clearly, Wentworth had only wanted to force Mountnorris to resign; his death was not envisaged and the deputy set him at liberty once his resignation had been obtained. Nevertheless, such extreme measures did nothing to improve Wentworth's reputation in England, all the more so as his administration of the Irish customs increasingly came under scrutiny. At court the earl of Holland and Lord Wilmot supported the attacks on Wentworth. Holland was one of the many courtiers whom Wentworth had managed to antagonize by his arrogance and intemperate remarks. Wilmot was a New English landowner in Ireland who, like many others, had felt the lord deputy's heavy hand.<br>
<br>Matters seemed to come to a head at the beginning of 1636, when there were rumours that the attorney-general would investigate the administration of the Irish customs farm. However, Charles's decision to appoint Bishop Juxon as lord treasurer in March 1636 defused the crisis. Nevertheless, Wentworth, who after Portland's death had denied all rumours that he wanted to become treasurer himself, decided to travel to England in 1636 to justify his proceedings in Ireland. When he arrived at court in June, he managed fully to restore the king's confidence in his actions. The six weeks he spent at court and in London in June and July 1636 have been called &#145;the most triumphant and unclouded of all his public life&#146;  (Wedgwood, 212). The contract for the customs farm was renewed: the lord deputy paid the same rent as before (&pound;15,500); of the additional profit&#151;exceeding the rent&#151;he was to retain one-quarter; one-eighth was to go to his friend, Sir George Radcliffe; and all the rest to the king, as Mountnorris and Sir Arthur Ingram no longer had a share in the farm.<br>
<br>However, Wentworth's actions were severely criticized by some in England. Clare, the father of his second wife, called his proceedings against Mountnorris &#145;blouddy, and tyrannicall&#146; and found his behaviour all too &#145;Prince like in every particular&#146;  (Clare to Lord Haughton, 1 Feb 1636, <span class="italic">Letters of John Holles</span>, 3.477). Clare had no real influence at court but many members of the king's entourage shared his sentiments. In the past English courtiers had considered it as no less than natural that they could benefit from &#145;cast up in Ireland whereby so many are enriched&#146;  (earl of Ancram to Wentworth, 22 Dec 1635, Wentworth Woodhouse muniments, Strafford papers, 8, fol. 365<i>r</i>). But Wentworth was adamant in thwarting the suits of even those nearest to the king when he felt that his own long-term plans, the crown's revenues, or his own profits were threatened. Even the earl of Arundel, the influential earl marshal, had to abandon his plans to claim extensive estates in counties Waterford, Carlow, and Kilkenny, which had allegedly belonged to his and his wife's ancestors. Wentworth roundly rejected his claims, taking the side of the local magnate, the earl of Ormond, whose property in co. Kilkenny was threatened by Arundel's attempts to acquire land. It must, however, have been particularly galling for Arundel that Ormond passed Idough, one of the lordships he had claimed himself, on to the Irish master of the rolls, Christopher Wandesford, in 1636. Wandesford was Wentworth's close friend and a member of the small coterie of Englishmen&#151;often from Yorkshire&#151;who had accompanied him to Ireland, a group which included Wentworth's brother George and Sir George Radcliffe. Arundel did not forget this incident, and during Wentworth's impeachment&#151;over which Arundel presided as lord steward&#151;the use of force against landowners in co. Kilkenny in the course of the new plantation provided the prosecution with valuable material (article 15 of the impeachment). Arundel was not the only English or Scottish courtier who found that Irish grants had become much more difficult to obtain than in the past. Others such as the marquess of Hamilton fared no better. Secretary Coke, the earl of Carlisle, and the duke of Lennox were among the few courtiers who managed to co-operate successfully with the deputy in pursuit of their interests in Ireland.<br>
<br>Perhaps Wentworth's reluctance to oblige courtiers by supporting their suits for grants in Ireland would have made him less unpopular if he had not made such a vast fortune in office himself. At the end of the 1630s he derived a profit of about &pound;8700 per annum from the Irish customs farm alone. His overall income can be estimated at about &pound;23,000, of which &pound;6000 came from his estates in Yorkshire, largely lands he had inherited or bought in the 1620s. A further &pound;5500 was the annual rent of his lands in Ireland, all of which he had acquired after his appointment as lord deputy, exploiting the opportunities his office offered for purchases on favourable terms. Moreover, before the collapse of the personal rule, Wentworth was in a position further to increase his income. In January 1638 a monopoly for the sale of tobacco was created for Ireland (parallel to a similar project for England). Wentworth farmed this monopoly himself for an annual payment of &pound;7000 to the crown; a rival offer by the marquess of Hamilton had been rejected by Charles I, who furthermore allowed Wentworth to use money from the Irish exchequer to the tune of &pound;40,000 to build up a stock of tobacco. It is unlikely that Wentworth derived any profit from this monopoly before the meeting of the Long Parliament, although there were unsubstantiated rumours that he had already made &pound;100,000 from it. Under more favourable circumstances he could have expected an additional annual income of at least &pound;2000 for his share of the farm.<h2>
<a name="IrelandandtheScottishcrisis"></a>Ireland and the Scottish crisis</h2>The years 1636&#150;7 mark the high point of Wentworth's authority and success in Ireland, although later events revealed that the basis of this success was by no means stable. Even in 1637 political decisions taken at court which he was unable to control threatened to undo everything he had achieved. In the early months of 1637 it seemed as if Charles I, in alliance with France, would enter into a war against Spain. For Ireland the consequences of such a decision would have been disastrous as it would have forced Wentworth to make concessions&#151;in particular to the Old English&#151;which were incompatible with his own political objectives. In March in a long memorandum the deputy warned Charles against a warlike policy. He feared that a war could be financed in England only by resorting to extreme measures which would destroy the political consensus he apparently still saw as the ultimate objective. A war would:<blockquote>necessarily put the King into all the high ways possible else will he not be able to subsist under the charge of it, and if those fail the next but be the sacrificing those that have been his ministers therein. (Wentworth to Laud, 3 April 1637, <span class="italic">Strafforde's Letters</span>, 2.66)</blockquote>This&#151;in retrospect prophetic&#151;remark clearly shows that he was still as strongly opposed to the &#145;high ways&#146; a war would provoke as ten years earlier, despite the undeniable change in his stance on other issues.<br>
<br>At the same time, however, Wentworth tried to establish closer contacts with members of the anti-Spanish and pro-French faction at court, who were close to the queen, probably realizing that the influence of his principal ally and friend at court, Archbishop Laud, would probably decline should Charles enter into an open alliance with France. Wentworth welcomed the earl of Northumberland's appointment as lord high admiral in February 1638 and also established connections with Northumberland's brother-in-law, the earl of Leicester, who was known to be no great friend of Laud's ecclesiastical policy. Leicester hoped to succeed Wentworth in Ireland, should he return to England. Northumberland's sister Lucy, widow of the earl of Carlisle, one of Wentworth's old allies at court, was among his closest friends, and helped to establish these contacts. Wentworth greatly admired Lady Carlisle for her beauty and charm. A few months before his death he said of her that: &#145;a nobler nor more intelligent friendship did I never meet with in all my life&#146;  (Whitaker, 221). Thus personal affection to some extent formed the basis of a possible political co-operation with members of the pro-French faction at court.<br>
<br>In spite of his attempts to forge new alliances at court the crisis in Scotland, which assumed ever more menacing dimensions in 1638, threatened to undermine Wentworth's position in Ireland and his support in England. The king's master of the horse, the marquess of Hamilton, one of the few courtiers with any influence in Scotland, now emerged as a key figure at Whitehall. Wentworth mistrusted Hamilton, as he increasingly did almost all Scotsmen, and he and the marquess were also at odds over a number of the latter's projects in Ireland. Having already outmanoeuvred Hamilton over the Irish tobacco monopoly, Wentworth also opposed the marquess's attempt to gain control of the lands of the Londonderry plantation, forfeited in 1635 and surrendered to the crown in 1637. Desperately in need of cash, Charles looked for a syndicate which would farm the plantation at the highest rent possible. One offer for the land came from Randal MacDonnell, earl of Antrim, and his associates, and was backed by Hamilton. Antrim was a grandson of the last earl of Tyrone and a Catholic, but was also married to the duke of Buckingham's widow, Katherine. Hamilton himself had married one of the duke's nieces and closely co-operated with Antrim, who professed himself to be Hamilton's client. Wentworth, who wanted to become the principal farmer for the plantation lands himself, argued that Antrim, as an Irish Catholic, would eject the protestant English settlers living in co. Londonderry and replace them with native Irishmen. Antrim's and Hamilton's intentions are not quite clear, but they certainly considered extending the leases only of the smallholders (of whom many were native Irish) while replacing the more substantial landholders with new tenants. Wentworth also opposed another bid for the plantation lands which came from some of the wealthier existing tenants themselves. These were represented by Sir John Clotworthy, the son of an English soldier&#150;adventurer settled in Ulster, but himself a presbyterian in sympathy with the covenanters and a man who had close connections with Wentworth's enemies in England, in particular the earl of Holland. Clotworthy, who was related by marriage to John Pym, was later to play a considerable part in the impeachment proceedings against Wentworth. For the time being the king rejected all offers made for the plantation lands&#151;including Wentworth's own&#151;and decided to administer the estates for his own account.<br>
<br>However, the future of the Londonderry plantation was not the only problem Wentworth had to confront in 1638. While unrest spread from Scotland to Ulster, where the Scottish settlers, mostly presbyterians, sympathized with the covenanters, the earl of Antrim submitted a proposal to the king in the summer of 1638 to attack the covenanters in Scotland with an army recruited primarily among his own clan in Ulster and Scotland. The MacDonnells or MacDonalds (as they were called in Scotland) still maintained a foothold in the western highlands and in the isles. While Antrim could rely on Hamilton's support at court, Wentworth systematically obstructed and sabotaged the earl's preparations for the campaign in western Scotland. The deputy did not believe that Antrim could realize his ambitious military plans; the earl had in fact almost no ready cash to spend, and it would therefore have been the task of the Irish exchequer to finance and equip his army, a prospect Wentworth did not relish. Moreover, Wentworth pointed out that the very proposal to recruit an army of Irish Catholics in Ulster was politically highly explosive, all the more so as Antrim originally envisaged appointing professional Irish soldiers who had served abroad and fought for Spain as officers, men like his cousins Owen Roe O'Neill and Daniel O'Neill, who were both later to play a considerable role in the Ulster rising of 1641. Nevertheless, Antrim's potential ability to gain support in Scotland may have been greater than Wentworth was prepared to admit. After months of hesitation Charles I finally ordered the deputy to support the earl in April 1639. However, by now it was definitely too late and the MacDonnells were unable to attack before the pacification of Berwick in June 1639.<br>
<br>Wentworth himself had been busy strengthening and enlarging the army in Ireland. The major part of the army was now stationed in Ulster to increase the pressure on the Scots settled there. In May 1639 they were required formally to abjure the covenant. The so-called &#145;black oath&#146;, administered to all adults of Scottish descent in Ulster in 1639, did nothing to endear Wentworth, who had already acquired a reputation as one of their most inveterate enemies, to either the presbyterian Scots in Ireland or their kinsmen in Scotland itself.<h2>
<a name="Thekingschiefcouncillor"></a>The king's chief councillor</h2>However, Wentworth's very radicalism, which now became ever more apparent, recommended him to the king as chief councillor when Charles realized that the very foundations of his monarchy were about to crumble in the summer of 1639. At this moment of despair Charles I, who in spite of the support he gave him had never unreservedly trusted Wentworth in the past, turned to the lord deputy and asked him to return to England. Wentworth received Charles's letter, written in his own hand and delivered by the bishop of Raphoe, on 5 August 1639. Wentworth arrived in England late in September and became a member of the important war council in December. Two months earlier the privy council had dismissed an appeal which the Irish chancellor, Lord Loftus, who was involved in a long-standing judicial feud with the lord deputy, had launched against a sentence of the Dublin court of castle chamber. Loftus now lost his office and was replaced by a candidate of Wentworth's choosing, Sir Richard Bolton. In January 1640 Wentworth was elevated to the position of lord lieutenant of Ireland, which allowed him to govern the country during his absence through a deputy, and on 12 January he was created an earl, taking the title of Strafford. He was also created baron of Raby. Raby Castle was owned by Sir Henry Vane, who became Sir John Coke's successor as one of the two secretaries of state in February, so by taking this particular title Strafford insulted one of the most important members of the privy council at the very moment of his greatest personal triumph&#151;a personal slight which Vane never forgave.<br>
<br>Strafford, who had managed parliament in Ireland so successfully in 1634&#150;5, was confident that this success could be repeated and that with parliamentary support he would be able to mobilize an army in Ireland which would considerably strengthen the king's hand in a renewed confrontation with the Scottish covenanters. Moreover, the support Strafford expected to receive from the Irish parliament was to serve as an example for parliament in England, which he advised the king to summon as soon as possible. He clearly underestimated the resentment against the policies of the personal rule and, as someone from the north of England, perhaps still saw the Scots as England's natural enemies, thereby overestimating the popular support for a national war against Scotland. In any case, Strafford's own ability to guide the king's policy during these crucial months was considerably diminished by his failing health. Recurrent attacks of gout, dysentery, and other health problems almost crippled him. Nevertheless he returned to Ireland in March to preside over the session of the Irish parliament which had met on 16 March. The two houses granted four subsidies of &pound;45,000 each, but considerable pressure and intimidation was necessary to achieve this result. The money was to finance a new Irish army of 9000 men, recruited over the coming months and transported from Ulster to Scotland at the end of June. As opposed to the army already in existence, this new force consisted mostly of Catholic soldiers, although the great majority of the officers were protestant. Some among the handful of junior officers who were Catholics, however, played an important part in the rising of 1641. Strafford, who had vehemently rejected the earl of Antrim's plans for a Catholic army in 1638&#150;9, now pursued a very similar policy himself. The new army was not ready for action until the end of July, and even then means of transport were lacking, so it could not intervene in the second bishops' war. Its very existence did, however, greatly increase fears in England that the king might use force against open or passive resistance to his policies&#151;and, even more dramatically, fears that there might be a popish conspiracy against England's liberties and established religion. Strafford did little to deny rumours that the new Catholic army might be employed in England as well as Scotland, although this was clearly not the plan of action in the summer of 1640.<br>
<br>The Irish parliament was prorogued on 31 March and Strafford immediately returned to England, where the Short Parliament assembled on 15 April. Due to his failing health the lord lieutenant did not arrive in London until three days later. When Charles's attempt to persuade parliament to finance a renewed war effort against the covenanters ran into difficulties Strafford advised the king to mobilize the Lords against those who rejected his demands in the Commons. However, he also spoke out in favour of a conciliatory attitude towards the Commons. Apparently he thought it best for the king to abandon ship money without an express demand for adequate financial compensation, on the assumption that the Commons would eventually grant supply once their mood had improved. Strafford's counsel was adopted by the privy council only in modified form, but on his insistence it advised the king to content himself with a grant of eight subsidies by the Commons in exchange for ship money. When Secretary Vane nevertheless insisted in parliament on twelve subsidies, negotiations broke down. In the council meeting early on the morning of 5 May, Strafford, like other members of the council, advised the king to dissolve parliament. When the eight members of the Scottish committee met after the dissolution on the same day, Strafford seems to have taken an even more extreme line, although the reliability of the records for this debate remains controversial. However, he clearly advised the king to pursue an offensive war against Scotland, convinced that Scotland's military strength was a mere fa&ccedil;ade and that &#145;the quiet of England will hold out long&#146;. He thought that now parliament had refused supply, Charles was &#145;absolved from all rules of government&#146;, and was entitled to raise money to finance the war by the authority of his prerogative alone  (Russell, <span class="italic">Fall</span>, 126). According to the existing record Strafford also said &#145;you have an army in Ireland you may employ here to reduce this kingdom&#146;  (ibid., 127). The immediate context of the debate makes it more than likely that &#145;this kingdom&#146; referred to Scotland, all the more so as at this time Strafford clearly did not anticipate any open resistance in England.<br>
<br>The lord lieutenant hoped that Spain could be persuaded to support Charles financially and entered into negotiations with the Spanish ambassadors. But Spanish power and financial solvency had reached its nadir in 1640 and nothing came of this. In July it was still envisaged that Strafford would take command of the Irish army, and on 3 August the king appointed him captain-general of the army which he was to lead into Scotland. Nevertheless, his patent also empowered him to suppress any sedition in Ireland, England, or Wales, should this prove necessary. In Ireland itself the situation was becoming increasingly critical as Strafford's friend Wandesford, who governed the kingdom as lord deputy in his absence, was confronted by an ever stronger and seemingly united opposition of Catholics and protestants. Strafford might have been able to quash this opposition, but he had to abandon his plans to go to Ireland, as Northumberland, the official commander of the king's forces in northern England, had fallen ill. As Northumberland's lieutenant-general, Strafford belatedly tried to create an army out of the scattered, ill-armed, unpaid, and demoralized troops which had been hastily recruited to fight against the Scots. In no condition to command an army, because of his failing health, not to mention his lack of military experience, he arrived in York on 26 August but soon recognized that the situation was utterly desperate. Indeed, he could do nothing to avert the impending catastrophe. After the battle of Newburn his authority declined rapidly and his attempts to steer the deliberations of the great council of peers which met on 24 September were largely futile, in spite of his hopes of renewing the war effort against the Scots. There were signs that he no longer enjoyed the king's wholehearted support. Many peers&#151;both courtiers and lords who had been out of favour with Charles during the 1630s&#151;held him responsible for the disastrous policies the king had pursued after the pacification of Berwick. Black Tom Tyrant as popular pamphlets called him was to foot the bill not only for these more recent political miscalculations but for all the mistakes and sins Charles I had committed over the past ten years.<h2>
<a name="Impeachmentandattainder"></a>Impeachment and attainder</h2>When parliament met on 3 November 1640 Strafford preferred to stay with the army in Yorkshire. He was clearly aware that he risked impeachment should he go to London. In spite of the king's defeat and his own political isolation he was not yet seen as a spent force but rather as the only man capable of tipping the scales and regaining the political initiative on the king's behalf. It was assumed, not without justification, that he was prepared to use force against his opponents, relying on the new Irish army still waiting beyond St George's Channel and the remnants of the king's army in Yorkshire. It was known that in the face of defeat his political outlook had become ever more radical and it was expected that he would not hesitate to have those he considered disloyal tried for treason, if given a chance to do so. Such assumptions explain the enormous hostility to him and the fear and hatred which his very name evoked. Moreover the Scottish covenanters, who saw him as their most dangerous enemy, wanted him out of the way. All the same Charles I, who now had few councillors he could rely on, asked Strafford to join him in London. The earl obeyed, very much aware of the danger awaiting him but too proud to reject the challenge to confront his enemies and perhaps also afraid that he would lose the vast fortune he had amassed in the king's service should he flee abroad.<br>
<br>Arriving in London on 10 November Strafford proposed to accuse the members of either house who had invited the Scots into England of high treason. Nevertheless, when he took his seat in the Lords on the 11th he did not raise the issue of the pro-Scottish party in England. He left, having remained silent. His enemies, led by John Pym, alarmed by his presence in London, were therefore able to pre-empt the charges he might bring against them. On the same day a committee of the Commons accused him of high treason and impeached him before the Lords. When Strafford hurriedly returned from Whitehall to the House of Lords he was arrested and committed to the gentleman usher of the black rod. It was not until 25 November, when the Commons had assembled a list of preliminary charges against him, that he was sent to the Tower. The Commons took a considerable time to draw up a complete catalogue of charges, and the trial in the House of Lords did not open until 22 March.<br>
<br>The impeachment obviously raised a number of complicated legal and constitutional issues. The traditional definition of treason enshrined in medieval and Tudor statutes made it difficult to consider treasonable actions which were not crimes against the king's person. Strafford's prosecutors could to some extent circumvent this problem by arguing that a councillor who advised the king to subvert the fundamental laws of the kingdom created a division between the monarch and the people and thereby undermined the very foundations of his rule. Strafford's actions were depicted not so much as actions against an impersonal state but against the legal order on which the king's rule was founded and therefore against his natural person&#151;inseparable from the legal order which constituted his kingship&#151;as well as against his body politic. Whatever the theoretical plausibility of such an argument, in practice it was not easy to sustain against a man who visibly still enjoyed the king's support. Even more serious than these legal problems was the difficulty of actually proving that Strafford had committed crimes which subverted the established legal order. The majority of the more serious charges against him related to his period of office in Ireland. The prosecution had been provided with abundant material by those who had suffered under his government, in particular the New English office-holders and planters. Nevertheless for the charges to stick it had to be assumed that the same legal rules were valid in Ireland as in England, and that the mere thought that Ireland was a &#145;conquered nation&#146; inferior in status to England (article 3) constituted treason. Such an argument may have been popular with the Dublin parliament but was much less so with the English House of Lords. Although it could be shown that Strafford's rule in Ireland had often been high-handed and arbitrary, he could demonstrate that earlier chief governors had ruled the kingdom with similar methods, admittedly mostly at times more turbulent than the 1630s. However, even the charge that he had used soldiers to collect revenues for the crown, to confiscate property and to enforce his orders in peacetime, thereby &#145;levying war&#146; against the king's subjects (article 15), lost some of its impact when the frequent use of military force and martial law in Ireland in the past was taken into account. More serious, however, was the charge that he had advised Charles I to use the Irish army against his English subjects on 5 May 1640, the day of the dissolution of the Short Parliament. On the other hand this accusation was supported only by the testimony of a single witness, Sir Henry Vane, the secretary of state. The other members of the Scottish committee of the privy council in which Strafford was said to have given the allegedly treasonable advice either could not remember the relevant sentence, or were convinced that the lord lieutenant had meant Scotland when he had spoken of &#145;this kingdom&#146; against which the army should be sent.<br>
<br>With enormous skill and great courage Strafford took apart most of the charges raised against him. He demonstrated that he was still the outstanding and charismatic orator who had dominated the House of Commons in 1628. He argued that if his opponents were allowed to create a new, unprecedented kind of treason out of individual actions which in themselves were at most misdemeanours, no man holding office could any longer feel safe. However, with the impeachment proceedings likely to collapse, Strafford's opponents changed their tactics. On 10 April the Commons decided to proceed by bill of attainder. Thus an act of legislation would declare Strafford's behaviour treasonable and at the same time condemn him to death. Clearly the stakes were now so high that it seemed impossible to abandon the attempt to have Strafford condemned. Moreover, less prominent members of the Commons seem to have feared that their leaders would come to some sort of fudged compromise with the king which would enable Charles to regain the upper hand politically, if Strafford was spared. The Commons passed the bill of attainder on 21 April by a majority of 204 to 59 votes. However, at the time the pressure on Strafford's supporters had already become very intense; the &#145;Straffordians&#146;, whose names were published soon after the division, were threatened by angry crowds, and feared for their lives. Although the Lords, who had come to resent the Commons' behaviour, had at first proceeded with the trial against the earl as if the bill of attainder had not been passed by the lower house, they were now exposed to the same popular pressure which had already intimidated many members of the other house. On 1 May the king appealed in person to the Lords not to condemn his former minister to death, stressing also&#151;much too late&#151;that he would never again employ him in his service. But at the same time he declared that he would never consent to a bill of attainder. He therefore offered an escape route to all peers who did not want to see Strafford executed but who were afraid to vote against the bill, for without the king's consent the bill could not become law. Charles committed a second mistake by sending soldiers to the Tower on 2 May to free Strafford, an attempt which failed. This incident, together with news about a much more wide-ranging plot to bring armed force to bear against parliament, created enormous excitement verging on hysteria in London. Strafford now released the king from his promise given in a letter on 23 April that he would save his servant's life, come what may. Strafford's letter to the king, which showed him willing to sacrifice himself, might have been used for a last appeal to the peers to show him mercy, but Charles failed to exploit this chance. On 7 May the Lords passed the bill in a thinly attended house. In all likelihood the majority in the crucial division was only 26 to 19, although some reports record a majority of 51 to 9 for the ultimate vote, when the matter of fact had already been decided. Fearing for the security of his family and for his crown, the king gave his assent to the bill of attainder on 10 May. When he heard of Charles's decision Strafford, in spite of his earlier willingness to lay down his life for the king, is reported to have remarked, &#145;put not your trust in princes&#146;  (Wedgwood, 380). He was executed by beheading (he was spared the traditional punishment for treason, to be hanged, drawn, and quartered) on the morning of 12 May 1641 on Tower Hill, facing death with great calm and courage. His body was later buried at Wentworth Woodhouse.<br>
<br>Strafford's death was greeted with jubilation by the London crowds, and at the time was probably mourned by only a handful of close friends, including Archbishop Laud who was himself a prisoner in the Tower. Nevertheless, far from solving the political crisis which threatened monarchy and parliament alike, it made any lasting political settlement almost impossible, for the king could never forgive those who had forced him to abandon one of his most faithful servants.<h2>
<a name="Historicalreputation"></a>Historical reputation</h2>Strafford was a controversial figure in his own lifetime and remained so after his death. A poem, probably written by John Cleveland shortly after Strafford's execution, stated:<blockquote>
<div>he lived and died here in a mist<br>
</div>
<div>A Papist and a Calvinist<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>The people's violent love and hate.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems of John Cleveland</span>, 66)</blockquote>In Ireland he was almost universally unpopular at the time of his fall. The Catholics were not alone in seeing him as a great oppressor who, shortly after his arrival in Dublin, &#145;began to play rex&#146; and had behaved like a Turkish &#145;Bashaw&#146;  (Clarke, &#145;Discourse&#146;, 167, 169). In England, on the other hand, royalists naturally considered him a martyr of their cause, although the judgement of his character which <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> gave in the king's name remained ambiguous, depicting Strafford as a man whose overweening self-confidence was likely &#145;to betray him to great Errors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, 5&#150;6). Clarendon to some extent shared this assessment of Strafford's personality as flawed, &#145;a nature too elate and arrogant of itself&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.341), while David Lloyd, who devoted the first chapter of his <span class="italic">Memoires</span> to Strafford as the &#145;Proto-martyr for Religion and Allegiance&#146;, was less reserved in his praise  (Lloyd, 20).<br>
<br>Whereas Nalson's <span class="italic">Impartial Collection</span> gave an account of Strafford's trial in the Restoration period which was intended to clear him of all charges raised against him, Rushworth documented the arguments of the prosecution as extensively as the lord lieutenant's own defence. The publication of Wentworth's letters by Knowler in the eighteenth century was an important landmark, but was highly selective, as Knowler's patron, the first marquess of Rockingham, Strafford's great-grandson, wanted to restore his ancestor's reputation by the edition. It nevertheless provided the essential foundation for all later historical works on Strafford's political life until the second half of the twentieth century. In his <span class="italic">History of England</span> David Hume came to the conclusion that Strafford's execution was an act of judicial murder, as his conduct in office was &#145;innocent, and even laudable&#146;  (Hume, 5.312). The prevailing liberal mood of the nineteenth century, however, was not favourable to Strafford's historical reputation. Macaulay called him &#145;a man of great valour and capacity, but licentious, faithless, corrupt, and cruel&#146;  (Macaulay, 1.119), though he was impressed by the force of the personality so vividly captured in Van Dyck's portraits of the lord lieutenant. Strafford's tragic end appealed to the romantic imagination of nineteenth-century authors, even to seemingly sober academic historians like S. R. Gardiner. For Gardiner, Wentworth's real tragedy lay in the fact that his political ideals were remnants of a bygone era: &#145;he attempted to maintain the Elizabethan constitution, long after it was possible to maintain it, and when the only choice lay between absolute government, and Parliamentarian supremacy&#146;  (Gardiner, <span class="italic">History</span>, 9.370).<br>
<br>In the first half of the twentieth century the decline of classical liberalism as a dominant political force and the increasing sympathy for authoritarian forms of government noticeable even in Britain gave rise to a more positive assessment of Strafford's personality and policies. Hugh O'Grady's <span class="italic">Strafford and Ireland</span> (1923) offered a very detailed, though clearly partisan, account of his period as lord deputy. He depicted Strafford as a great and high-minded reformer, whose downfall was brought about by narrow-minded proponents of &#145;particular interests&#146; and the forces of sectarian fanaticism which did much more harm to Irish national interests by appealing to the English parliament against him than Strafford had ever done. The three biographies published in the 1930s by Lady Burghclere (1931), Lord Birkenhead (1938), and C. V. Wedgwood (1935) all showed a great deal of sympathy for Strafford. He emerged as a heroic though not necessarily flawless figure. The most scholarly and influential of the three is that by Wedgwood. It was reissued in a second edition in 1961, when Strafford's unpublished correspondence had finally become accessible, and has in its revised form remained the standard account of his life. However, the period after the Second World War witnessed a much more critical assessment of Strafford's personality. The fact that the Strafford papers could now be consulted, rather than the misleadingly selective edition of his letters by Knowler, revealed the less high-minded side of his character. Both Terence Ranger and Hugh Kearney exposed the ruthlessness and, as they thought, hypocrisy of his actions as lord deputy in Ireland, holding him responsible for the crisis which led to the outbreak of rebellion in 1641, an account which has only recently been qualified or contradicted by other historians.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>No complete reassessment of Strafford's personality and policies has emerged during the past decades, but historians looking for a politician who in his opinions and actions embodies Charles I's alleged political agenda as an absolutist ruler still see him as the man best qualified to play this role. However, these historians face the same problem as their nineteenth-century predecessors or, indeed, the men who brought Strafford to trial in parliament in 1640&#150;41. Being absent from London, Strafford's influence on the politics of the personal rule in England before the autumn of 1639 was very limited. Although his ruthlessness and autocratic cast of mind were already visible during his period of office as lord president of the north, this was arguably more a matter of political style than of principle. Matters were certainly different in Ireland, but given the traditions of English government there he was no exception in employing ruthless methods, often with scant regard for legal niceties, to achieve his objectives. What distinguished his policy from that of earlier governors was primarily his determination to attack the vested interests of the protestant office-holders and settlers just as radically as those of the Catholic landowners. Although he clearly took great pride in his achievements as lord deputy, there is no real evidence that Strafford really believed that Ireland could serve as a model for England&#151;Scotland was potentially a different matter&#151;unless extraordinary circumstances totally changed the traditional framework of government in England. Strafford's fate was determined by the fact that he returned from Ireland under exactly such extraordinary circumstances, when Charles I was fighting a war in which his political survival was at stake and which could, it seemed, be won only by desperate means. Strafford was prepared to resolve this crisis with the same ruthlessness which he had shown in Ireland, but it is unlikely that he would have pursued a similar course of action had he returned to England under less extreme circumstances. In fact, until the very end parliament remained a natural part of the political order Strafford tried to uphold. He was indeed convinced that parliaments could and needed to be &#145;managed&#146;, and should not attempt to give direction to government policy, but at least the latter conviction was no more than a traditional view shared by many contemporaries.<br>
<br>Looking at Strafford's correspondence from the 1630s one encounters an autocratic ideal of government and high-sounding denunciations of meddlesome common lawyers, but in the last resort his political apprenticeship in Yorkshire offers a more important key for understanding his personality and political position than the ideal of absolutism to which he allegedly subscribed. He began his political life in the poisonous atmosphere of faction-ridden Yorkshire county politics where to win political battles court connections were exploited just as ruthlessly as opportunities to appeal to popular sentiment against one's opponents. Early on he himself became the victim of public humiliations and attacks. Once in office he remained prone to pursuing personal vendettas against real or suspected enemies, a pattern that persisted in Ireland. Moreover, he was singularly incapable of understanding the convictions of men who did not share his own political outlook, be they Irish Catholics or radical English protestants who saw the pope's hand in every setback they suffered. Rejecting the comprehensive anti-popery so widespread among strict protestants at the time, he saw English puritans or Scottish presbyterians primarily as rebels against the established order in church and state. Being obsessed even more than other members of the early seventeenth-century gentry and peerage with status, honour, and the defence of the traditional social hierarchy, the &#145;Puritan popular humour&#146;  (letter to Radcliffe, 5 Nov 1640, Whitaker, 219) was clearly anathema to him, not so much, it seems, for theological or religious but for political reasons.<br>
<br>Strafford was a man who played many parts in his life, most of them as a truly accomplished actor, who, depending on the stage he was acting on, unreservedly identified himself with his role: &#145;honest patriot&#146; and defender of the subject's liberties; conscientious office-holder and autocratic governor of a country half-province, half-colony; potential favourite and leading minister relentlessly in search of personal advancement and profit; and, finally, his last role&#151;as the allegedly &#145;evil councillor&#146; sacrificed to atone for his master's misguided policies and as a man who after defending himself with great courage and skill against his enemies stoically faced the inevitable. Some of these roles he chose and devised himself, others he found ready-made, or accepted because political circumstances and social conventions forced him to do so. Perhaps the twenty-first century is better qualified to understand such a complex personality than earlier periods of history, which tended to believe in the ideal of the autonomous individual inspired in his actions by a consistent set of values and principles. Yet in the end Strafford's life, in spite of the many roles he played, had a greater consistency than many of his enemies or later critics were prepared to admit.<br>
