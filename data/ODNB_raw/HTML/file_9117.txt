<span class="headword">Falconer,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1732, <em>d.</em> 1770), <span class="occ">poet and lexicographer</span>, was baptized in Edinburgh on 11 February 1732, which was possibly also the day of his birth. He was one of three children of William Falconer, wig maker, and Agnes Shand of the Nether Bow, Edinburgh. Nothing is known of Falconer's childhood except that he had some rudimentary schooling under one Webster before he went to sea as an apprentice, probably in the coal trade from Northumberland to London, about which he makes knowledgeable references in his poetry.<br>
<br>Evidence for Falconer's seafaring life is to be adduced from his long poem <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span>, which he claims to be autobiographical. If so, by 1749 he had completed his apprenticeship and had joined a British merchant ship in the Levant trade at Alexandria as second mate. The ship, homeward bound via Venice, was driven off course by a furious gale and was wrecked at Sunium in Greece. Falconer was one of three survivors. In 1751 he was in Edinburgh for his first publication, an ode on the death of Frederick, prince of Wales. His life for the next decade is obscure. He was almost certainly at sea in merchant ships, and there is evidence from <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span> that he also served in the Royal Navy and may have been in Hawke's fleet at Quiberon Bay (November 1759). A surviving logbook records that in 1760 he was serving as mate on the <i>Vestal</i> frigate in the north Atlantic trade.<br>
<br>Falconer's serious literary career began in May 1762, when he was in London for the publication of <span class="italic">The Shipwreck: a Poem, in Three Cantos, by a Sailor</span>. The poem was favourably reviewed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> on 1 June, and the reviewer's hope that the poem would achieve for its author &#145;preferment in the service&#146; was fulfilled on Falconer's appointment as midshipman on the <i>Royal George</i> on 10 June, though with peace approaching the ship was laid up and the crew paid off in December.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of the following year until Falconer's appointment as purser of the <i>Glory</i>, laid up in Chatham Dockyard in Kent. Falconer perhaps gained this post on the recommendation of Edward, duke of York, who had shown the poet some patronage. This began a period of appointments as purser of laid-up vessels (<i>Medway</i>, 1767; <i>Swiftsure</i>, 1767; <i>Cumberland</i>, 1768); these positions can be regarded as sinecures since Falconer was able to employ deputies for his peacetime purser's duties, leaving time for literary pursuits. Clarke records that the captain's cabin on the <i>Glory</i> was &#145;fitted up with a stove, and with every addition of comfort &hellip; in order that Falconer might thus be enabled to enjoy his favourite propensity&#146;  (Clarke, xxxv).<br>
<br>The first fruit of this change from seafaring was the publication in 1764 of a second edition, extended and much revised, of <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span>. That spring Falconer married Jane (1734/5&#150;1796), daughter of William Hicks, surgeon of Sheerness Dockyard. He began to engage in literary and intellectual friendships, for example with Thomas, brother of Jonas Hanway, and with John Murray, whose invitation to enter into his new publishing venture in 1768 Falconer declined. Friendship with George Lewis Scott led to the suggestion in 1764&#150;5 that Falconer compile a nautical dictionary, an undertaking that had its origins in the copious notes of technical explanation he had attached to <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span>. Proposals were published in 1767, and <span class="italic">The Universal Dictionary of the Marine</span> was published in March 1769, by which time Falconer and his wife were living in Somerset House, London.<br>
<br>Falconer's reputation rests on these two major works: the <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Marine</span> and <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span>. The former is a work of extraordinary care and scientific thoroughness, and it became the standard nautical dictionary until the end of sail. The popularity of <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span> derives from its unique character as a technically detailed seafaring verse narrative, full of pathos and sublimity, from the pen of a professional sailor. Of the three versions, the first is the most accessible to a modern reader, unembellished by the extensive refinements added later to suit contemporary taste. It was highly praised by later writers, including Byron and Coleridge, and its popularity continued into the mid-nineteenth century. J. S. Clarke's 1804 edition, followed by all subsequent editors, is textually very faulty. Falconer's other poems&#151;short lyrics, a political squib on Pitt, odes, and descriptive pieces&#151;are unremarkable.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1769 Falconer agreed to sail with the East India Company commissioners who were appointed for the restoration of order in India, probably with the promise of a secretaryship on arrival. The frigate <i>Aurora</i> sailed on 30 September; contrary to most accounts Falconer was a passenger, not the purser. After his departure a third and again much revised edition of <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span> was published in November. The <i>Aurora</i> arrived at Cape Town on 6 December 1769, sailing on 22 December. She was reported in Madagascar in April 1770. Nothing was heard of her again, despite searches by the <i>Morse</i> Indiaman in 1771. Falconer can be presumed to have died in 1770.<br>
