<span class="headword">Collins,  Richard Henn</span>, Baron Collins  (1842&#150;1911), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Dublin on 1 January 1842, the third son of Stephen Collins QC (<i>d</i>. 1843), of the Irish bar, and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of William Henn, a master in chancery. He was educated at Dungannon School, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1860, was elected scholar in 1861, and passed his final examinations in 1863 with honours in classics and moral science, but left without graduating. He did, however, receive the honorary degree of LLD from the college in 1902. In 1863 he moved to Downing College, Cambridge, where he came fourth in the classical tripos of 1865, and was elected to a college fellowship the same year. He was made an honorary fellow of Downing College in 1885. He joined the Middle Temple on 8 May 1862, and was pupil in the chambers of John Welch and R. C. Williams. He was called to the bar on 18 November 1867. In September 1868 he married Jane Ogle (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Ogle William Moore, dean of Clogher; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Collins joined the northern circuit and made a slow start in practice. He was not showy, and was less successful with juries than some barristers of less ability. His strength lay rather in his industry and knowledge of the common law. In 1876 he was chosen, with G. Arbuthnot, to edit the seventh edition of John William Smith's <span class="italic">Leading Cases</span>, which had previously been edited by justices Willes and Keating; he was also jointly responsible for the eighth (1879) and ninth (1887) editions of Smith's <span class="italic">Leading Cases</span>. This experience helped his reputation as a case lawyer both at the bar and on the bench. He was made queen's counsel on 27 October 1883. Complicated business transactions and litigation between rival municipalities or railway companies were his speciality.<br>
<br>Collins did not possess the characteristic manner or voice of an advocate, but he excelled in presenting his case and framing his arguments. Lord Esher, master of the rolls, then the dominant force in the Court of Appeal, showed that he was impressed by Collins's arguments, and this enhanced his reputation among solicitors. He was regularly employed in the heaviest cases in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords, and he was one of the very few common-law counsel who argued in the chancery courts. He was appointed a judge of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice on 11 April 1891, on the resignation of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen. His exceptional learning and acuteness were at once recognized. His judgments combined clear arrangement and logical accuracy with an unusual insight into commerce and business. Expertise in traffic laws led him to be chosen in 1894 to succeed Sir Alfred Wills as judicial member and chairman of the railway and canal commission.<br>
<br>Collins nevertheless continued with the ordinary routine of <i>nisi prius</i> and circuit work and was an able criminal judge. When the president was absent through ill health, he also sat for two or three months in the divorce court.<br>
<br>On Lord Esher's retirement in November 1897, Collins was appointed to the Court of Appeal and was sworn of the privy council. In 1901 he succeeded Sir Archibald Levin Smith as master of the rolls, and on the death of Horace, Lord Davey, in 1907 he was made a lord of appeal, and granted a life peerage with the title of Lord Collins of Kensington. In the Court of Appeal he showed no inclination to interpret liberally statutes of which he disapproved, such as the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span> of 1897, and his numerous judgments under the act were frequently reversed by the House of Lords. A tendency to undue subtlety and over-refinement brought him more than one rebuff from their lordships.<br>
<br>Collins took on much external public work. As master of the rolls he was chairman of the Historical Manuscripts Commission from 1901 to 1907. He played a leading part in the management of the Patriotic Fund. In 1899 he represented Great Britain on the tribunal to determine the boundaries between British Guiana and Venezuela. The inquiry, held at Paris, resulted in a unanimous decision in favour of Great Britain. In 1904 Collins was appointed chairman of a commission consisting of himself, Sir Spencer Walpole, and Sir John Edge, set up to investigate the case of Adolf Beck, a Swedish resident in London who had been twice (in 1896 and 1904) wrongfully convicted at the central criminal court on charges of defrauding and robbing prostitutes. Their report helped to bring about the <span class="roman">Criminal Appeal Act</span> of 1907.<br>
<br>Collins's health was already failing during his last years in the Court of Appeal, and he was seriously ill when promoted to the House of Lords. He resigned as lord of appeal on 7 October 1910, and was succeeded by the attorney-general, Sir William (afterwards Lord) Robson. He died at 24 First Avenue, Hove, on 3 January 1911 and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 9 January. He was survived by his wife and five children.<br>
<br>In private life Collins was unassuming and sympathetic in manner. His sense of humour made him a popular after-dinner speaker. The prose and verse contributions he made as a barrister on the northern circuit won him the honorary title of poet laureate. He was also the first president of the Classical Association (1903). Collins never stood for parliament.<br>
