<span class="headword">Walworth, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1386?), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was one of twin sons, possibly of the William Walworth who was granted land in 1314 in Darlington, co. Durham. Evidently both boys were well educated, possibly at Durham: Thomas gained a master's degree and became a canon of York, while William himself acquired numerous books of theology, devotion, and law, which he carefully distributed in his will. Among his bequests was one remitting a debt of 100 marks owed to him by the monastery at Durham, where his arms were displayed in the cloisters. They were borne also by the family that succeeded him in the manor of Middleton St George, near Darlington. His will, though, does not mention either parent, and his bequests for masses and the foundation of a chantry were for the soul of his former master, the rich fishmonger and four-times mayor of London, John Lovekyn, who was the founder of his fortune.<br>
<br>Lovekyn's will of 1368, which appointed Walworth as one of his executors, refers to him still as his servant. Walworth's social origins and education were not uncommon among apprentices in the greater livery companies, which offered prospects of wealth in the wool trade. Fishmongers were prominent in the trade because they owned ships, and Lovekyn was one of London's biggest wool exporters in the 1360s. Walworth also dealt in corn as well as fish. In 1369 he was licensed to send &pound;200 to Sweden to buy herring, and similarly to buy 1000 quarters of wheat and malt in the ports between Newcastle and Orwell to ship to London. His bequests for the repair of the highway between Southwark and Newenton, and to local churches, as well as his property at Walworth, suggest that this area was important in his business.<br>
<br>Before Lovekyn's death Walworth must have been acting as his partner because he succeeded him as alderman of the fishmongers' ward of Bridge, and he quickly became prominent in London's politics. In 1369 he was one of the four Londoners experienced in naval and mercantile matters who were elected to advise the king after the war against France was renewed in that year. He was one of the merchants who complained in 1370 that the ships they had loaded at Sluys had been plundered at Calais. He was also one of the foremost defenders of the overseas wool staple, which was the principal means by which the English merchants defeated alien competition in the export trade.<br>
<br>Walworth was elected mayor of the Westminster staple in 1369. This position, which he held to his death, meant that he acquired an expert knowledge of the credit operations of the London wool merchants, and also of the chief money market of the kingdom. His financial abilities and legal interests equipped him well for this and for later appointments of a judicial or financial nature. In 1370 he was chosen to hear cases of usury in London. He also had extensive financial resources of his own. In 1370 he was the third highest contributor to the city's loan to the king, and he continued thereafter, with other leading London merchants, to be a crucial source of loans for the crown.<br>
<br>Walworth's election as sheriff in 1370 came at a time when the renewal of the French war had inaugurated a period of exceptional strain in the political life of the kingdom and also within the city of London. The war necessitated repeated taxation, which culminated in the levying of the unpopular poll taxes. The export of coin, and its shortage at home, brought about depression and unemployment in the towns. Merchant ships were impressed to carry troops, and suffered losses from naval warfare. Royal policy, which favoured alien merchants for financial reasons, threatened not only the London wool merchants but also importers and craftsmen. They sought to protect their businesses by recovering the old commercial privileges of the city, which had allowed them to exclude aliens and non-citizens from its retail and distributive trade. In 1370 the draper John Northampton, a skilled agitator, and some disaffected mercers began to stir up protests and disorder in the streets of London.<br>
<br>The chief anxiety of Walworth and his fellow staplers was the crown's policy, begun in 1371, of raising money by selling licences for wool exporters to evade the Calais staple. His election as an MP for London that year, and then as mayor for the first time in 1374&#150;5, undoubtedly reflected the staplers' hopes that he would defend their interests against those aldermen who were profiting from the sale of the licences and from raising expensive loans for the crown. Walworth failed in his attempt to outbid them by offering cheaper loans in return for the enforcement of the overseas staple.<br>
<br>The discontents of the kingdom at large were vented against the royal government in the Good Parliament of 1376. The London staplers made common cause with Northampton's rebellious group to elect Walworth and one of Northampton's supporters as MPs. But whereas the staplers were successful in their demands, Northampton failed to win the restoration of London's commercial privileges and undoubtedly believed he had been betrayed by the staplers. Under the threat of creating disorders which would invite the crown's intervention, Northampton forced the staplers to agree to constitutional changes that he hoped would increase the power of his following in London. These included the annual election of aldermen, and of common councillors by the mysteries instead of the wards. Walworth was one of the two aldermen chosen to assure the king that these changes would ensure the good government of the city.<br>
<br>One reason for the choice of Walworth was that he was friendly with influential courtiers, probably through lending them money. He first acted as a feoffee that year for William Wykeham, bishop of Winchester and chancellor of England. Their friendship proved to be lasting. They shared a love of books and art, something that once led Walworth to take as security from a Flemish merchant not the usual plate but a book of romance and a tapestry of Arras work. Wykeham later chose Walworth to assist in the endowment of his college at Winchester and Walworth bequeathed money to Wykeham and two of his books to the bishop's foundation of New College, Oxford. They also both experienced the enmity of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, who in 1377 secured the disgrace of Wykeham, while at the same time threatening the independence of the city.<br>
<br>Walworth was again elected an MP for London in October 1377, and was chosen by the Commons as one of two treasurers to receive and disburse the taxes granted for the war to ensure that they were spent only for that purpose. Lancaster caused both treasurers to be removed at the parliament held in 1378 at Gloucester, but Walworth testified to the stout opposition put up by the city's representatives against the court's attacks on them. The same year he was appointed with three other staplers to attend a royal council to advise on protection at sea. Once Lancaster's influence had waned, Walworth was appointed to other royal inquiries, for instance that of March 1380 into the destitution of the people. Another testimony to his judgement and his fairness was his election in January 1381 by the German merchants resident in London as their alderman to represent their interests.<br>
<br>By then Walworth was serving as mayor for a second time. Disturbances in November 1380 indicated that many Londoners shared the discontents of the kingdom for which the poll tax of 1381 provided the spark of revolt. Londoners may have helped to co-ordinate the marches on the city of the rebel peasants from Kent and Essex. Indeed, two aldermen&#150;fishmongers, John Sibyl and Walter Horn, were later alleged to have opened the gates to admit the rebels. These accusations originated among enemies of Walworth's, and should probably be discounted&#151;the opening of the gates may simply have been the result of the prevailing confusion. But there are grounds for believing that Horn, who was sent by Walworth to negotiate with the peasants at Blackheath, gave them some encouragement. Whether Walworth connived with him it is impossible to say; certainly he had reason to doubt whether he could count on the city's militia to defeat the rebels. But after the murder of royal ministers only the city's government stood between the kingdom and revolution. The militia was obviously in readiness, but within the city, when the king met the rebels at Smithfield on 15 June. Probably Walworth did not plan to kill Wat Tyler. However, in previous personal confrontations he had shown an impetuous streak, and Tyler's insolence roused him to lunge at him with his sword, either killing him outright or inflicting a mortal wound, before he rode off to fetch the militia. Walworth was knighted by Richard II with three other aldermen on the field, and he subsequently helped to restore order in London, Kent, and Middlesex.<br>
<br>Walworth's successor as mayor in October 1381 was John Northampton, who seems to have been chosen by the aldermen to appease his powerful patron, Lancaster. When the staplers refused to raise loans for Lancaster's military plans, Northampton brought pressure on them by attacking the fishmongers who held six aldermanries. In a succession of measures he deprived them of their trade and of all political offices. Uncharacteristically, it seems that Walworth did nothing to defend his mystery. A fellow fishmonger claimed that Northampton was attacking them to avenge his arrest by Walworth when he was sheriff in 1371, and after what had happened to Northampton's other prominent victims Walworth may have feared for his own safety. However, in March 1383 he did stand surety for the four former aldermen whom Northampton had imprisoned in the Tower of London. When Sir Nicholas Brembre defeated Northampton in that year's mayoral election, the statutes against the fishmongers were repealed. Subsequently Walworth tried without success to conciliate Northampton, and to persuade him to end his violent pursuit of power.<br>
<br>Walworth acquired extensive property in London which he bequeathed for her lifetime to his wife, Margaret. They had no surviving children, and she died in 1394. He was obviously close to his brother, Thomas, to whom he bequeathed most of his books, plate, and other personal possessions. Walworth died, probably in January 1386, at his house in Thames Street; his will, dated 20 December 1385, was enrolled on 13 January 1386. He was buried in St Michael, Crooked Lane, which he had greatly enlarged by adding a new choir and chapel, and where he had established a small college of chantry chaplains. His sister, Cecilia, predeceased him, leaving five daughters, and his sister, Agnes, was married to a London chandler. He bequeathed &pound;20 to each of his two apprentices, one of whom, William Askham, succeeded him as the occupier of his house in Thames Street, where Lovekyn had once lived. It was to become the site of the Fishmongers' Hall where a larger than life, and still surviving, wooden statute of Walworth was set up in 1685.<br>
