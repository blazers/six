</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wentworth, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1737&#150;1820), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 9 August 1737 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, America, the son of Mark Hunking Wentworth (1710&#150;1785) and his wife, Elizabeth Rindge. He was born into a prominent New Hampshire political family; both his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68773/', "John Wentworth")</script> and his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68772/', "Benning Wentworth")</script> had served as royal governors of the colony. The foundation of the family's success had been set by <a name="cosubject_29060"></a><span class="headword">William Wentworth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">landowner in America</span>, who was baptized on 15 March 1616 at Alford, Lincolnshire, the eldest son of William Wentworth of Rigsby and Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter, widow of Uther Fleming. Wentworth was a close friend of John Wheelwright (1592?&#150;1679), who was then vicar in the neighbouring parish of Bilsby. Both men were committed puritans who became embroiled in religious controversy. In April 1636 Wentworth and Wheelwright travelled to Boston, Massachusetts. Two years later Wentworth once more joined with Wheelwright after his earlier ejection from Boston, again following religious controversy. Together they founded the settlement of Exeter in New Hampshire, before settling in Wells, Maine, in early 1643. After a spell in Dover, Massachusetts, Wentworth finally returned to New Hampshire, where he remained for the rest of his life and became a ruling elder of the Congregational church. He died at Dover on 16 March 1697.<br>
<br>Wealthy and well connected, William's descendant John Wentworth was in a good position to enjoy a profitable and public career. However, John's adult preferences for a sybaritic lifestyle contrasted vividly with the Wentworth family's puritan roots. During the early 1760s Wentworth spent five years in London. This period was particularly revealing because it demonstrated that, in addition to being able to charm fellow colonials at home, Wentworth was equipped to mix effortlessly in English &eacute;lite society. Indeed, so adept was he in this latter respect that he gained the support and patronage of the whig political leader and prime minister, Charles Watson-Wentworth, marquess of Rockingham. Wentworth was to flatter Rockingham further when, having married his cousin, Frances Deering Wentworth, on 11 November 1769, he named his only child Charles Mary after the Rockinghams, a childless couple.<br>
<br>On his return to New Hampshire, Wentworth was appointed surveyor-general of the king's woods in North America, a position previously held by his uncle. He took his duties&#151;notably the provision of masts for the Royal Navy&#151;particularly seriously as well as enjoying the freedom of the outdoors. On 11 August 1766 he succeeded his uncle to become royal governor of New Hampshire.<br>
<br>As governor Wentworth had to contend against a charge of corruption brought against him by one of his councillors, the disputatious Peter Livius. He managed to overcome this challenge to the Wentworth hierarchy by 1773, though not before incurring considerable legal costs. His disappointment in not benefiting from his uncle's will in 1770 rendered these costs even more burdensome. Yet in terms of the larger picture these occurrences were mere inconveniences compared with the turbulence then being created by the advancing tide of radicalism in the thirteen colonies which finally affected even quiet New Hampshire. Confident of his abilities, Wentworth fled the colony only in 1775. In order to continue the struggle, he then took steps to organize a volunteer corps of loyalists&#151;an effort which was abandoned only after the defeat at Saratoga in October 1777. His return to England found him hardly unique in being both an exile and, having lost his American possessions, in very much reduced circumstances. Wentworth made do by establishing the legitimacy of a loyalist pension and by a habitual effrontery in the face of creditors; though clearly angling for the post of governor of Nova Scotia, he eventually decided in 1783 to accept a resumption of the lesser role of surveyor-general. As before, he pursued his duties with vigour. On the occasions when he did return to Halifax, he was astute enough to remain aloof from the controversies surrounding the governor, John Parr. However, Wentworth's new position was not to the liking of his wife, Frances, who found solace in openly flaunting a relationship with the much younger Prince William Henry during his sojourns in harbour. Wentworth himself was to have one openly acknowledged natural son in addition to another child who was the result of a liaison with a woman of maroon origin from Jamaica in the 1790s. Despite these infidelities, however, John and Frances retained a genuine affection for each other. Fortuitously, they were in London together in 1791 when news arrived that John Parr had died. The resulting situation was ideally suited to Wentworth's lobbying skills. Thus it was that at a salary of &pound;2300, Wentworth proudly set sail for Halifax in March 1792 and was sworn in as lieutenant-governor on 13 May. His record of achievement in the early years of his long term of office did much to efface the reputation of the colony as &#145;Nova Scarcity&#146;. Helped immeasurably by the onset of increased economic activity resulting from the French Revolutionary Wars, the public debt had been wiped out by 1797. Unlike Parr, Wentworth established a co-operative relationship with the holder of the first colonial bishopric, Charles Inglis. As in New Hampshire, Wentworth again put himself in the forefront of educational change. In a manner consistent with their social pretences, if not with their finances, the Wentworths also entertained lavishly. Wentworth's importuning for a baronetcy was crowned with success on 16 May 1795. His coat of arms brandished his connection with the Rockinghams, a claim which was as politic as it was spurious.<br>
<br>If these years marked the high point in terms of Wentworth's family's social status, they also saw his career beset with an increasing series of problems, that were mainly, if not entirely, of his own making. Faced with the need to balance the claims of earlier settlers and those who like himself had fled the American War of Independence, Wentworth did little to hide his partiality in gubernatorial appointments. Important posts went to his own kind. To this was added a bias in favour of the Haligonian merchants as opposed to agriculturists and outport interests. Wentworth also suffered in these years from his being a civilian governor during wartime. Nevertheless, he did not help his own cause by letting the expense of raising the Royal Nova Scotia regiment (after 1793) get out of control. Another controversial episode in Wentworth's later term of office was the result of his prolonged attempt (1796&#150;1801) to settle a colony of maroons in Nova Scotia. The maroons were descendants of slaves who had escaped to form a community of <i>de facto</i> independence in Jamaica; they had subsequently come to Nova Scotia after armed conflicts in 1795&#150;6. Now they showed themselves unwilling to make many concessions to their supporters, who expected them to adopt a segregated, settled, and Christian existence. Undoubtedly Wentworth was prompted to uphold their cause more because he saw them as a means of solving an acute wartime labour shortage rather than from any degree of enlightened attitude on his part towards &#145;outsiders&#146;. For example, in this regard he displayed only a tincture of concern for the Mi'kmaqs and the Acadians after the prospect of conflict with France became a real one. The d&eacute;b&acirc;cle ended when the decision was made to send the unfortunate maroons to Sierra Leone. The whole affair had been an expensive experiment, soon to be exacerbated by the rising costs incurred in the building of a new government house. So unsatisfactory were matters at the turn of the century that it appeared for a time as if Wentworth's term of office might well be terminated.<br>
<br>Aside from the disastrous financial implications of such a change for Wentworth, it might have been better had he been spared the acrimonious and bitter struggle which ensued with a member of the assembly by the name of William Tongue or Tong (1764&#150;1832). The latter was an early settler who portrayed himself as representing &#145;country&#146; interests against a corrupt and effete &#145;court&#146; party. Tongue also donned the mantle of &#145;tribune of the people&#146;&#151;a claim which Wentworth, given his own view of himself as at one with his subjects, was bound to resent. The personal feud became interwoven with constitutional disputes between the assembly and the council with Wentworth at its head. After what he had experienced in New Hampshire, Wentworth was apt to interpret any form of opposition as being potentially rebellious. Hence the lieutenant-governor became increasingly vindictive towards his tormentor. Ultimately, Wentworth did succeed in driving Tongue out of office and from the colony. But it was a pyrrhic victory. The record keepers in the new Colonial Office (1801) could hardly have failed to notice how much of Wentworth's official correspondence was obsessively related to Tongue. The completion of the elegant government house in 1808 at a cost of &pound;30,000 was not enough to save him, and in the same year he was replaced as lieutenant-governor by Sir George Prevost. The couple returned in 1810 to England, where Frances died on 14 February 1813. Wentworth, even in his dotage, did not escape the indignity of having to run from his creditors once more. He returned in 1812 to Nova Scotia, where an annuity, the salary as surveyor-general, and a few firm friends provided for him until his death there on 8 April 1820; he was buried at St Paul's, Halifax. The baronetcy ceased upon the death of Charles Mary in 1844.<br>
