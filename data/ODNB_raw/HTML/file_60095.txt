<span class="headword">Hide,  Mary Edith <span class="st"> [Molly]</span></span>  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">cricketer and farmer</span>, was born in Shanghai, China, on 24 October 1913, the elder of two children of Arthur Hide and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jansen. Her father ran a business in China and she was four years old when the family returned to England. At her local school in Haslemere, Surrey, a games mistress instilled an enthusiasm for cricket. Hide moved on to Wycombe Abbey School and then became the first woman to gain a diploma in agriculture at Reading University. For most of her career she combined playing cricket with working on and then managing the 200 acre family farm at Haslemere.<br>
<br>Hide was the epitome of women's cricket. She played in the very first test match, for England against Australia in Brisbane in 1934, and took over the captaincy of her country in 1937. During the next seventeen years she became England's most successful captain and when she was laid to rest at the age of eighty-one it was as a universally revered figure. Tall and calm, Hide was a masculine type of character. She led from the front and expected nothing less than total commitment from her teams. Some did not find her sufficiently encouraging but there was always total respect for a colleague who set high standards and knew what she was doing.<br>
<br>A classic right-hand bat, Hide defied her parents by taking her place in the 1934&#150;5 touring team to Australia and New Zealand. When she planned to return for the 1939 tour they insisted she should not &#145;go gallivanting&#146; again. In the event the Second World War intervened, the tour was cancelled, and Hide accepted full responsibility for the upkeep of the family farm for four years. Hide's first innings on that pioneering 1934&#150;5 tour was a century, against Western Australia, and she recorded the first of her two test centuries when England moved on to Christchurch in New Zealand. Played in February 1935 it was New Zealand's first test match and Hide (110) and Betty Snowball (189) put on 235 runs for the second wicket in only 142 minutes. This was of course a world record and it remained the only record of those trailblazing days to survive to the end of the twentieth century. Hide was twenty-one when she undertook that tour and quickly emerged as a young player with a great future. Not only did she contribute steady scores, but her bowling success was also substantial. She delivered off spin but, as captain, did not make the full use of her own talent. A return of thirty-six international wickets, at an average of 15.25 runs, included at least two test winning performances.<br>
<br>When 1937 came around and it was time for Australia to embark on the return tour of England, Hide was a natural choice to lead her country. Her philosophy drew the crowds and 5000 turned up for the first test at Northampton. Hide's main objective was to try and play bright, attractive cricket, and obtain a definite result. She was not afraid of defeat and as captain of England in all home and overseas tour years from 1937 to 1954, eleven test matches in all, she won four times. Only England's original captain, Betty Archdale, had a better win ratio, three out of four played. No other England captain has, however, won more matches than Hide, despite, as the years ticked by and the game progressed, the fact that many more matches were played.<br>
<br>Hide was delighted with the attention women's cricket received during her years as captain. Looking back on the 1949 tour to Australia she recalled what a thrill it was playing on such grounds as Sydney, the Adelaide Oval, and the Western Australia Cricket Association ground in Perth: all test match venues today. The third test in Sydney was especially memorable. Amid a glut of runs Hide scored 63 and 124 not out, after which her portrait was hung in the pavilion. This match was also the first time that women had been allowed to use the men's dressing rooms in the main pavilion.<br>
<br>As befitted her pioneering instinct Hide was also one of the first two women to enter another holy of cricketing holies, Lord's. Along with Amy Bull, Hide was invited by the Marylebone Cricket Club, then the game's governing body and based at St John's Wood in London, to join an MCC committee and discuss the future of cricket. Hide had been retired over twenty years when women were first allowed to play at Lord's: a one-day international between England and Australia in 1976. It took another twenty-three years and much public debate before women were accepted as members of the MCC.<br>
<br>Hide's last test match was against New Zealand at the Oval in London in 1954. That match was drawn, but England had won the first test and thus the series was theirs. Hide finished with a test batting average of 36.33, her highest score in an aggregate of 872 runs being her 124 not out at the Sydney cricket ground.<br>
<br>As well as captaining England, Hide turned out for her local club and Surrey, and large crowds flocked to Mitcham Green whenever she was playing. She was totally committed to cricket and on her retirement from active service became a selector, manager, and administrator for both Surrey and England. She stepped in as president of the Women's Cricket Association when Mary Duggan died on the eve of the 1973 world cup. It was the biggest undertaking in the history of women's cricket. England had invited six teams to contest the very first world cup, for men or women. England won and Hide was, of course, delighted.<br>
<br>As well as playing lacrosse for England, Hide was, for many years, secretary of the Peper Harow Park fly-fishers club. On her death one member remarked that &#145;the mark Molly Hide left on the river-bank is indelible&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 16 Sept 1995). The same could certainly be said of cricket. Shortly before her death she handed over her England blazer and badges to the Women's Cricket Association archivist for safekeeping. She was always extremely proud of her contribution to the history of women's cricket. She died, unmarried, on 10 September 1995, at Clare Park, Crondall, Hampshire, of cancer. Her remains were cremated, and her memorial service, at St Bartholomew, Haslemere, on what would have been her eighty-second birthday&#151;24 October 1995&#151;was overflowing with those wishing to pay tribute to a sporting legend.<br>
