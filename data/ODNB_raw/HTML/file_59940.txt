<span class="headword">Eckenstein,  Lina Dorina Johanna</span>  (1857&#150;1931), <span class="occ">feminist polymath and cultural historian</span>, was born on 23 September 1857 at 17 St George's Villas, Islington, London, the daughter of Frederick Gottlieb Eckenstein (1820/21&#150;1891), a German businessman, and his wife, Julie Amalie Antonia Helmke (1830/31&#150;1921). One of six children, her younger brother was the mountaineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62367/', "Oscar Eckenstein")</script>. No trace of her education in England has been found, so it is likely that she was educated in Germany and Switzerland; it is improbable that she acquired her proficiency in French, German, and Italian, classical and medieval Latin, Middle High German, Middle English, and classical and medieval European history entirely unaided. In 1881 she was living at her parents' home in Islington.<br>
<br>The first reference to Lina Eckenstein's activities is found in the manuscript record made by her friend Maria Sharpe of her time with the Men and Women's Club (1885&#150;9). The club had been founded by Karl Pearson for a few &#145;middle class radical-liberals, socialists and feminists &hellip; to talk about sex&#146;  (Walkowitz, 57). In 1888 Eckenstein, whose membership of the club was supported by Olive Schreiner, presented papers entitled &#145;Sexual relations among the Romans&#146; and &#145;Sexual relations during the Reformation period in Switzerland&#146;, having already taken up a feminist stance the previous year in the club's discussions on state regulation of prostitution. In 1889 she accompanied Maria Sharpe on a pilgrimage to Ibsen's Norway.<br>
<br>Herself a &#145;new woman&#146;, strong-faced as well as &#145;strong-minded&#146;, Lina Eckenstein is an illuminating example of what the new woman did next&#151;once she was no longer &#145;new&#146;. First she earned a little money teaching, translating, proof-reading, indexing, and being a research assistant to more eminent male scholars while she herself researched and wrote her ambitious cultural study <span class="italic">Woman under monasticism: chapters on saint-lore and convent life, 500&#150;1500 <span class="smallcap">AD</span></span>, published by Cambridge University Press in 1896. Citing a vast range of translated materials from medieval France, Sweden, Britain, and Germany, she postulated that the &#145;right to self-development and social responsibility which the woman of to-day so persistently asks for, is in many ways analogous to the right which the convent secured to womankind a thousand years ago&#146;  (preface), while also appreciating that it was, eventually, to be in the lands of the Reformation &#145;that the modern movement for women's education [arose]&#146;  (conclusion).<br>
<br>In the late 1890s Lina Eckenstein became German governess to Margery Corbett, later Dame Margery Corbett Ashby, who became her lifelong friend as well as a leading suffragist and Liberal advocate of disarmament. In 1902 Eckenstein published her detailed account of the life and art of Albrecht D&uuml;rer and <span class="italic">Through the Casentino</span>, a record of her tramp, knapsack on back, through the upper valley of the Arno. During 1903 to 1906 she was occupied in the startlingly different world of Egyptology, as she joined Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda&#151;another close friend&#151;on several important archaeological digs. She &#145;took charge of the registration, mending and storing of objects and helped in the general running of the camp&#146; at Abydos, Sethos, Saqqara, El Shatt, and Serabit  (Drower, 268). At one testing moment, when village hooligans were reported to be out to destroy the excavation in the dark, &#145;Miss Eckenstein, always enterprising &hellip; joined hands and danced with a great variety of fancy steps all the way from the camp to the dig&#146; with Hilda Petrie and Margaret Murray in the moonlight to scare away the men  (Murray, 116). At the age of forty-eight she rode with Hilda Petrie and an Egyptian desert tracker on camel-back to Sinai, across rough mountain country and red sandstone gorges, armed with whip, revolver, and water bottle. Eckenstein later turned her archaeology into historical and imaginative reconstruction in her article &#145;The moon cult in Sinai&#146; (1911), <span class="italic">A History of Sinai</span> (1921), and her strange fable of Moses's youth under the pharaohs, <span class="italic">Tutankh-aten</span> (1924). Fifty years before the Opies' authoritative work, she published her pioneering <span class="italic">Comparative Studies in Nursery Rhymes</span> (1906), triggered by her sight of a cult scene in the temple of King Sety that seemed to anticipate &#145;The Death and Burial of Cock Robin&#146; 3000 years later.<br>
<br>Between 1908 and 1910 Eckenstein's antiquarian work gave way to the contemporary struggle for equal citizenship, as she contributed articles for the Women's Franchise League and gave public lectures on the history of the changing status of women. In 1920, at the International Women's Suffrage Alliance congress at Geneva, she helped Margery Corbett Ashby with translation of the congress proceedings from and into English, French, German, and Italian. She was interested that the international women's movement should still be urging the endowment of motherhood and the abolition of state regulation of vice&#151;questions discussed over thirty years earlier in the Men and Women's Club.<br>
<br>Despite suffering from ill health, Lina Eckenstein continued to be intellectually vigorous to the end. She wrote the drafts of two works published posthumously&#151;<span class="italic">A Spell of Words: Studies in Language Bearing on Custom</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">The Women of Early Christianity</span> (1935) about the first women disciples, including &#145;those who cut off their hair and, assuming the garb of a man, went forth devoting themselves to the cure of bodies and souls&#146;  (p. xiv). Herself a lifelong sceptic, she focused on the contribution made by Christianity to humanism and feminism. She died from coma and exhaustion, together with chronic cystitis, at her home, The Cell, Little Hampden, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, on 4 May 1931. She was unmarried. Her friend from the Men and Women's Club days, the pioneering doctor Ethel Williams, wrote of her: &#145;It is easy for the feminist movement to appraise what it owes to its executive and political leaders; it is more difficult to realize what it owes to its scholars and philosophers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Leader</span>).<br>
