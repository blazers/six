<span class="headword">Lucas,  Simon</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1766&#150;1799), <span class="occ">explorer and diplomat</span>, was the son of a London wine merchant. He was wrongly identified in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as William Lucas. While still a boy he was sent to Cadiz to be trained as a merchant, but was captured on his return voyage by a Sal&eacute; rover and pressed into slavery in the imperial court of Morocco. After three years' captivity he was freed and went to Gibraltar and was thence sent back to Morocco as vice-consul and <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> by General Edward Cornwallis, governor of Gibraltar from 1762 to 1773. He remained in Morocco for sixteen years.<br>
<br>In 1785 Lucas returned to England and was appointed oriental interpreter to the British court. Soon afterwards he volunteered to undertake a journey in Africa in the service of the newly formed Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa, commonly known as the African Association. This was founded in 1788 to undertake geographical exploration, not least with the aim of opening the continent to British trade and influence. Lucas volunteered his services to the society, suggesting that his knowledge of Arabic and of north African lands would be useful. He stipulated that he must receive his salary of &pound;80 per annum in his absence from his post as interpreter. The African Association accepted his offer, secured his paid leave from his position, and furnished him with presents and other equipment to the value of &pound;250, subscribed personally by the association's committee members.<br>
<br>Lucas left England in August 1788 with instructions to cross the desert from Tripoli to Fezzan collecting information from the local people and traders about the interior of Africa and returning home via the Gambia or the Guinea coast. He landed at Tripoli on 25 October and was well received by the pasha, whom he told that his mission was to investigate antiquities and medicinal plants. He secured leave to travel to Fezzan, but his departure was delayed by the revolt of the Arab peoples who occupied the territory through which he was intending to pass. This made it impossible for him to proceed alone as planned, but the arrival in Tripoli of two sherifs, both claiming descent from Muhammad and one, Imhammed, being the son-in-law of the king of Fezzan, offered a way out. Their positions allowed them to take responsibility for his safe conduct, and Lucas set out in their company on 1 February 1789. They had, however, travelled only a short distance when it became obvious that the disturbed conditions would make it impossible for the party to reach Fezzan before the winter, and the caravan determined to break up. But before the party dispersed, Lucas used his time to gain from Sherif Imhammed much geographical information about Fezzan, Bornou, and Nigritia. Lucas left Memoon on 20 March 1789 and reached Tripoli on 6 April and England on 26 July of that year.<br>
<br>Lucas's account of his voyage in Africa was published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the African Association (vol. 1, 1790) but it was clear that the association felt it had got little for its money. Joseph Banks, its president, commented: &#145;Mr Lucas and Major Houghton [Daniel Houghton, the next explorer sent out by the association] do not appear to have been well chosen; the inexperience of Your Committee in the selection of proper persons must plead their excuse&#146;  (Hallett, 168). Frederick Hornemann, also sent out by the association to Africa, met Lucas in Tripoli in 1799 and commented: &#145;I don't know if the Committee believes his excuses for his returning to England, or if they give them so little credit as I do myself&#146;  (ibid., 189). Indeed the consul for Morocco remarked of Lucas in a letter to Banks that he &#145;has got such a determined habit of lying that he is quite a proverb not only over all Barbary but at this place [Gibraltar]&#146;  (ibid., 155n.).<br>
<br>If the information which Lucas brought back was not wrong, neither was it particularly original, and memories of his journey for the association were rapidly eclipsed by those of other explorers sent out by the association. In 1793 he was appointed consul at Tripoli, a result perhaps due in part to his attempts to discredit Mr Tully, the previous consul. He was last heard of in October 1799 by the report of Hornemann.<br>
