<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bonar,  Horatius</span>  (1808&#150;1889), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and hymn writer</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 19 December 1808. He was the sixth son of James Bonar, the second solicitor of excise at Edinburgh, and his wife, Marjory Maitland (<i>d</i>. 1854), the daughter of James Pyott, bailie of Montrose. Bonar was educated at the high school and the University of Edinburgh, where his contemporaries included Robert Murray McCheyne (1813&#150;1843). After attending the Divinity Hall, Edinburgh, he was licensed as a preacher and did mission work at Leith.<br>
<br>In November 1837 Bonar settled at Kelso as the minister of the new North Church, founded as a part of Thomas Chalmers's church extension scheme. He became a prominent evangelist and a popular preacher. He anticipated the methods of the Evangelical Alliance by arranging for eight or more days of united prayer, and instituted special meetings once a month for children. He also produced many pamphlets, editing a series of religious tracts known as the <span class="roman">Kelso Tracts</span>, and published evangelical works of considerable popularity, such as <span class="italic">The Night of Weeping</span> (1846), which sold 59,000 copies. The influence on Bonar of Edward Irving's lectures in 1828&#150;30 on the Apocalypse was evident in <span class="italic">Prophetic Landmarks</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">The Coming and Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (1849). While he was still at Leith he had begun to write the hymns for which he is best known, a practice which he continued at Kelso. On 16 August 1843 he married Jane Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1884), the third daughter of Robert Lundie, a former minister at Kelso. They had three sons and six daughters. Jane was sympathetic to his work, and seems to have written religious verse herself. She died in December 1884.<br>
<br>At the Disruption in 1843 Bonar and his congregation joined the Free Church of Scotland. Some years later, however, the North Church reverted to the Church of Scotland, and Bonar was obliged to hold services first in a hired room and later in a church lent by the burgh council. This hardship was not his to endure for any length of time: in June 1866 he was appointed minister of the Thomas Chalmers Memorial Church in Edinburgh. His reputation continued to grow during this ministry: his congregation followed suit, increasing from 61 in October 1866 to 805 in July 1888. He continued to hold children's services, established a mission at Causewayside in the poorer part of his parish, and preached frequently in the open air in addition to his usual Sunday duties. In 1874 he shared a platform with the American evangelist Dwight Moody. Bonar continued his literary activities: in 1862 he published <span class="italic">God's Way of Peace: a Book for the Anxious</span>, which was translated into French, German, and Gaelic, and sold more than 285,000 copies during his lifetime. He was the editor of several religious journals, including the <span class="italic">Christian Treasury</span> and the <span class="italic">Presbyterian Review</span>. Several events varied his ministerial and literary activities. In 1856 he visited Palestine, a journey which resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">The Desert of Sinai</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">The Land of Promise</span> (1858). He is said to have composed hymns even as he crossed the Sinai Desert on a camel. In May 1883 he became moderator of the general assembly of the Free Church of Scotland. He died in Edinburgh on 31 July 1889, survived by only four of his children.<br>
<br>Bonar was (and is) best known for such famous hymns as &#145;I heard the voice of Jesus say&#146; (1846). His verses are spontaneous and essentially lyrical; he composed them quickly and rarely revised his work, which explains the retention of some very poor lines. He wrote more than 600 hymns, which appeared in publications such as <span class="italic">The Bible Hymn Book</span> (1845) and <span class="italic">Hymns of Faith and Hope</span>, published in three series between 1857 and 1866. In <span class="italic">The Scottish Hymnary</span>, a work widely used by Scottish and Irish Presbyterians, eighteen of his hymns were included. J. Julian's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Hymnology</span> (1907) reported that 110 of his hymns were in common use at the time of its publication, but their popularity later declined, possibly because Bonar's premillenarian sentiments were less and less favoured. It is a sad irony that Bonar, one of the few Scottish hymn writers to gain an international audience for his work, never heard his hymns sung in his own church in Edinburgh, since his was one of the Free Church congregations which opposed the introduction of hymns.<br>
