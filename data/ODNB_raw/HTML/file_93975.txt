<span class="headword">Sams,  Eric Sydney Charles</span>  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">musicologist and literary scholar</span>, was born at 3 Cedars Avenue, Walthamstow, Essex, on 3 May 1926, the only child of Henry Sydney Sams (1897&#150;1968), a petty officer in the Royal Navy, and later a clerical officer in the General Register Office, and his wife, Violet Lois, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (1901&#150;1990). He demonstrated his remarkable intellect at Westcliff high school, where he acquired an encyclopaedic knowledge of music, as well as of English, French, and German literature, which he could thereafter quote at length. At sixteen he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. However, he first joined the army intelligence corps, where he worked on decoding enemy messages during the Second World War. He also saw service in Palestine. Only in 1947 could he take up his Cambridge scholarship, graduating with a BA in French and German in 1950. In the intelligence corps he had met Enid Mary Tidmarsh (1920&#150;2002), a pianist, and daughter of Walter James Tidmarsh, a retired sales representative. They married on 30 June 1952, and settled in Sanderstead, south of Croydon. They had two sons, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1955), later a Japanese translator and chess expert, and Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1957), later a theatre director, translator, and composer.<br>
<br>After Cambridge, Sams joined the civil service, where he became a principal officer in the department of employment. Despite professional and family duties he found time to pursue his consuming interest in music and language, especially as fused in classical song. In 1961 <span class="italic">The Songs of Hugo Wolf</span>, providing text, translation, and detailed analysis of each of Wolf's songs, won high praise, and a similar book on Schumann's songs followed in 1969. His work also led to the discovery of Schumann's extensive use of cipher, which he demonstrated in 1965&#150;6, to sometimes sceptical readers, in articles in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>. His Wolf and Schumann publications brought the award of a doctorate by Cambridge University. Sams's remarkable musical and literary knowledge, combined with his ability to write lucidly and humorously (with brilliantly witty plays on words), also led to articles and reviews for the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> on not only German romantic music but a wide range of other musical subjects. These included, in 1970, articles on Edward Elgar's use of code, with a projected solution of the &#145;Enigma&#146;. Sams was also a frequent radio broadcaster, between 1976 and 1978 was opera critic of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and reviewer for <span class="italic">Gramophone</span>, and in 1976&#150;7 he was visiting professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. He also wrote major articles for the <span class="italic">New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>.<br>
<br>In 1978 Sams took early retirement from the civil service. In 1980 he published a detailed analysis of Schubert's final illness, and he also became recognized as an authority on historical shorthand, decoding the messages of such diverse figures as William Clarke, secretary to Cromwell's army, and Sir John Thompson, prime minister of Canada in 1892&#150;4. However, his overwhelming preoccupation in retirement was Shakespeare studies. To these he brought the disciplines that had stood him in such good stead in music, most particularly the rejection of traditional beliefs unsupported by hard evidence. This also lay behind his own atheism. Sams recognized that Shakespeare, far from being a late developer springing fully formed as conventional wisdom maintained, would like any other creative artist have improved and revised. Thus variant versions of the plays, customarily classified as &#145;bad quartos&#146; or &#145;memorial reconstruction&#146;, were more logically early versions from the &#145;lost years&#146; unaccounted for by Shakespearian orthodoxy. He supported his theories by painstaking comparison of words or usage in these disputed plays with those in plays acknowledged as Shakespeare's own. Besides a flood of articles and letters in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> and elsewhere, Sams published (with attributions to Shakespeare) editions of <span class="italic">Edmund Ironside</span> in 1985 and <span class="italic">Edward III</span> in 1996. In between came <span class="italic">The Real Shakespeare: Retrieving the Early Years, 1564&#150;1594</span> (1995), presenting a revolutionary chronology of Shakespeare's early career. His attribution of <span class="italic">Edward III</span> (mooted by Edward Capell in 1760, but discounted by later scholars) soon gained endorsement, though his more radical ideas gained little ground with those whose reputations were built on twentieth-century Shakespearian traditions.<br>
<br>In 1989 Sams addressed a wider audience in a television film, <span class="italic">Code and Cipher in Music</span>, and in 2000 he followed his studies of Wolf and Schumann (which had meanwhile gone into revised editions) with <span class="italic">The Songs of Johannes Brahms</span>. However, a projected companion volume on Schubert never materialized. Moreover, his wife's death and his own ill health prevented completion of a planned book on Shakespeare's later years, but the extant material was published online in 2008 on a website dedicated to Sams's writings.<br>
<br>The incisiveness of Sams's intellect could be daunting, and his barely disguised contempt for certain academics hardly helped his Shakespearian cause. His writings on German song, though, remain unchallenged as masterpieces of insight and clear expression. Sams was a kindly, considerate, witty, and entertaining companion and correspondent, and he would go out of his way to provide practical help and encouragement to those in whom he saw promise. He died in Highgate Nursing Home, Islington, London, on 13 September 2004, of pneumonia following a stroke, and was cremated at Islington crematorium on 22 September. He was survived by his two sons.<br>
