<span class="headword">Garland,  Alison Vickers</span>  (1862&#150;1939), <span class="occ">suffragist and political activist</span>, was born on 10 April 1862 at 1 Village Road, Oxton, Cheshire, the daughter of Alfred Stephen Garland, master silversmith, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Priestley. She combined suffragism with an active role in Liberal politics, and lectured on subjects as diverse as bimetallism and infant welfare. It was as a Liberal that she spoke in Devon and Cornwall at meetings of the Central and West of England Society for Women's Suffrage in 1897. In the following year she joined the executive committee of the Union of Practical Suffragists, a ginger group within the Women's National Liberal Federation (WNLF) that aimed to persuade women's Liberal associations not to work on behalf of Liberal parliamentary candidates who were anti-suffrage. In 1899 she was elected president of the Devon Union of Women's Liberal Associations and in December of that year she attended the Indian National Congress held in Lucknow, as a delegate of the British Indian parliamentary committee. While in India she travelled, made speeches, and collected some thousands of pounds for famine relief on the subcontinent, work that she continued on her return to Britain.<br>
<br>In 1904 Garland joined the executive of the WNLF. Her involvement in suffrage societies continued and on 9 February 1907 she participated in the 3000-strong march from Hyde Park to Exeter Hall in the Strand organized by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, and dubbed the &#145;mud march&#146; because of the state of the demonstrators' clothing at the finish. The decision of the WNLF in 1903 to seek from Liberal parliamentary candidates a commitment to women's suffrage led to the voluntary dissolution of the Union of Practical Suffragists in that year. But when the &#145;test&#146; question resurfaced in 1905, the decision to disband seemed premature, and in 1908 the Forward Suffrage Union emerged to renew the pressure. Garland was again involved, and represented the group on the suffrage deputation received by Asquith and Lloyd George on 17 November 1911. The deputation sought to persuade the government to give parliamentary time to the <span class="roman">Conciliation Bill</span> introduced earlier that year. That bill, however, seemed likely to enfranchise many more Unionist than Liberal women, and Garland showed political realism by proposing instead that an extensive suffrage amendment be included in the government's own <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span>, scheduled for 1912. It was a course of action that Asquith had indicated would have government support, though when it was tried in January 1913 the speaker of the Commons unexpectedly ruled the suffrage amendment out of order, and a settlement of this vexed issue was further delayed.<br>
<br>Garland is sometimes credited  (Crawford, 236) with the authorship of a suffrage play, <span class="italic">The Better Half</span>, which was performed at the King's Hall, Covent Garden, on 6 May 1913 to an audience principally consisting of members of the Actresses' Franchise League. The drama promoted &#145;the cause&#146; by depicting an imaginary society where only women possessed the vote and could make laws, and where men, supported by some of the women members of parliament, were campaigning for the vote  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 May 1913, 10). However, both the play, and a novel published in 1888, <span class="italic">By the Tide</span>, appeared over the name of Alison L. Garland.<br>
<br>Enabled by the 1918 <span class="roman">Franchise Act</span>, for which she had so long campaigned, Garland stood for parliament on three occasions. Her best performance was her first, at Portsmouth South in 1918, when she came second to the Conservative, after winning nearly 19 per cent of the vote. But at Dartford, Kent, in 1922 she lost her deposit in a three-way fight, and at Warrington in 1929 she fared no better. The Liberals were specially weak in Lancashire, and Garland, who came last with barely 7 per cent of the vote, again lost her deposit. She nevertheless played an active role in post-war public affairs and at the women's international housing congress at Caxton Hall, in July 1924, identified a lack of tradesmen as a factor in the housing shortage in Britain. &#145;If you clothe me suitably&#146;, she said, &#145;I will undertake to learn bricklaying in four months&#146;, a bold promise that was met with laughter and cheers from the audience  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 July 1924).<br>
<br>Towards the end of her life Garland played a central role in the affairs of the WNLF, and served as its president from 1934 to 1936. At the annual conference at Scarborough on 17 May 1933 she moved a resolution urging an international solution to the problem of war debts and reparations, which she believed caused the stagnation of world trade. And in her first speech as president, at Kingsway Hall in May 1934, she warned of the dangers of political extremism in England, at a time of fascist and communist dictatorship abroad. This presented both a challenge, and an opportunity, to Liberalism. The possibility of fascist candidates standing in urban constituencies at the next election, she suggested, might take votes away from Conservatives, allowing the Liberals to win seats: &#145;It was the unexpected that happened in politics. An international situation might arise that would dominate the election, and the Liberal attitude to that situation might sweep the field&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 May 1934). Such optimism for her party proved to be ill-founded.<br>
<br>At the WNLF conference at Blackpool in 1935 Garland was re-elected president. The conference gave enthusiastic support to the policies of the &#145;New Deal&#146; being pursued in the United States and Garland advocated a similarly positive response to the continued high levels of unemployment in Britain. She followed the line given by the party leadership in recommending a &#145;prosperity loan&#146; to attract industrial investment: &#145;This is the brilliant idea of Mr Lloyd George, and we entirely agree&#146;  (<span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, 22 May 1935, 13c). Garland, who in her day was styled &#145;a Lloyd George in petticoats&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Dec 1918, ELS 3d), died on 26 September 1939 at her home, 21 Ferndale, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. She was unmarried.<br>
