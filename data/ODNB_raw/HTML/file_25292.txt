<span class="headword">Sheffield,  Edmund</span>, first Baron Sheffield  (1521&#150;1549), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born on 21 November 1521, the elder son of Sir Robert Sheffield (<i>d</i>. 1531), of West Butterwick, Lincolnshire, and his first wife, Jane Stanley, a second cousin of Henry VIII. His family had prospered in recent generations, mainly through legal practice, and Edmund, who had a younger brother, David, and a sister, Eleanor, was heir to a substantial estate in the north midlands and Lincolnshire. Following his father's death on 15 November 1531, on 28 April 1533 Edmund's wardship was granted to George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. Rochford was executed on 17 May 1536, and on 2 January 1538 the wardship and marriage were granted to John de Vere, fifteenth earl of Oxford; the grant probably confirmed an existing situation, for by the end of that month Sheffield was married to Oxford's daughter Anne, and the earl was asking Thomas Cromwell to be good lord to his son-in-law. About this time Sheffield was duly numbered among the &#145;Gentlemen of my lord Privy Seal's mete to be preferred unto the King's Majesty's service&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/2, no. 1184).<br>
<br>Cromwell's services to his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; were not confined to such presumed patronage. Predeceased by his first wife, Sir Robert Sheffield had later married Margaret Zouche. Following Sir Robert's death his widow herself remarried, her second husband being John Cavendish. About 1538 Edmund Sheffield quarrelled with Cavendish and sent him rude letters which came into Cromwell's hands. Sheffield now wrote to the secretary in Latin, addressing him as a fellow evangelical&#151;&#145;most vigilant patron [&#147;Maecenas&#148;] of holy scripture&#146;&#151;and begging for his intercession. This lengthy epistle, which apologizes for literary incompetence while exuding all the self-confidence of a clever young man, may well have amused Cromwell, who had it endorsed &#145;Edmund Sheffelde Scolasticall Letter&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/134 fol. 202<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). Another quarrel about this time put Sheffield in prison, whence he sent Cavendish (now apparently on good terms with him) a letter in English, full of scriptural references and asking for a visit and also for an appeal to Cromwell on his behalf. Neither episode did Sheffield any harm. Having attained his majority at the end of 1542, he had livery of his lands on 7 February 1543. In 1544 he went with the army to France. Before he left, on 20 May, he made his will, which reveals that by this time he had a son, John, and two daughters, Frances and Eleanor. On the same day he conveyed his estates in Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire to trustees headed by Henry Howard, earl of Surrey. Two years later he accompanied Viscount Lisle's embassy to France.<br>
<br>At the end of 1546 Sheffield was one of ten men considered by Henry VIII for promotion to the baronage, and one of only four to be eventually ennobled: his charter of creation was given on 16 February 1547. His qualifications in terms of past services are hardly conspicuous. He was a wealthy man, however, able in his will to order the payment of debts and bequests totalling some &pound;3000, and with lands assessed at &pound;400 per annum in 1547, and it may have been hoped that he and Sir William Willoughby of Parham, likewise made a baron, would fill a gap left in the structure of authority in Lincolnshire in 1545 by the death of the county's greatest lord, Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, leaving a nine-year-old heir. He may also have owed his ennoblement to his personal qualities: loyal, brave, cultivated&#151;Thomas Fuller later wrote of him, &#145;Great his skill in music, who wrote a book of sonnets after the Italian fashion&#146;  (Fuller, 2.291)&#151;and with reformist leanings in religion, perhaps he was simply the sort of promising young man the old king liked and wished to advance.<br>
<br>Later in 1547 Sheffield was appointed to the Lincolnshire peace commission (though not to the quorum), but was arguably still too young for a role in government. He never had the chance to take such a part. In 1549 he joined the royal army confronting Kett's rising in Norfolk, and was a member of the force with which the marquess of Northampton tried to occupy Norwich on 31 July. The incursion came to grief in the city streets, and Sheffield fell into a ditch while wheeling his horse and was killed by the rebels, pleading in vain for his life&#151;a butcher named Fulke is said to have struck the fatal blow. He was buried next day in St Martin's at the Palace, Norwich. Sheffield's death prompted grief at the loss of a gifted young man, and also outrage at the killing of a nobleman by his social inferiors. Barnabe Googe, only nine at the time but a native of Lincolnshire, later addressed an epitaph to Sheffield as &#145;good Lord whom deare I loved&#146;, and denounced the &#145;crabbed Clowns&#146; and &#145;Dunghyll Dogs&#146; who slew him  (Googe, 69&#150;70), while Sir John Cheke paid warm tribute to his virtues, describing him as &#145;both fit for counsell in peace, and for conduct in war &hellip; being loved of everie man, and hated of no man &hellip;&#146;  (Holinshed, 3.1046). In 1551 his son John, in compensation for his father's expenses two years earlier, was granted from his inheritance an annuity first of &pound;20 and then of nearly &pound;50, and also his own marriage. His widow, who later married John Brock of Colchester, died early in 1572.<br>
