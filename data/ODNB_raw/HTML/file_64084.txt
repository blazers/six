<span class="headword">Maule,  William</span>, earl of Panmure of Forth  (1699/1700&#150;1782), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was the third but eldest surviving son of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18366/', "Harry Maule (1659&#150;1734)")</script> and his first wife, Lady Mary Fleming (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of William, fifth earl of Wigtown. William Maule was the last male of the house of Maule, a family that could trace an unbroken descent in the male line for 760 years. His father was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18367/', "James Maule, fourth earl of Panmure (1658/9&#150;1723)")</script>. Both his father and uncle were ardent Jacobites who fought at Sheriffmuir and, as a consequence, forfeited their estates in Forfarshire and spent many years abroad in exile. Maule was educated at Leiden (1718) and the Scots College in Paris (1719) and despite his unfortunate family affiliations was presented at court on the succession of George II in 1727. He appears to have been a committed Hanoverian and was able to obtain a commission at that time in the 25th infantry regiment, although his progress in the army was not as rapid as he might have wished. However, after service at Dettingen in the War of the Austrian Succession (1743) he was raised to an Irish peerage as Viscount Maule of Whitechurch and earl of Panmure of Forth. Two years later he served at the battle of Fontenoy; further commissions in the Royal Scots Fusiliers and the Scots Greys and a posting to Gibraltar in 1753 led to his eventual promotion to the rank of colonel in 1770.<br>
<br>Under the patronage of the earl of Ilay, Panmure became MP for Forfarshire in 1735, an office he held until his death, despite a vigorous challenge by Thomas Lyon (son of the earl of Strathmore) in 1768. Lyon's bid led supporters of both candidates to create votes through artificial divisions of their estates. This resulted in a multitude of appeals and counter-appeals to the court of session and the House of Lords, and a temporary dislocation of the Forfarshire commission of supply as it split on the question of the division of the cess. The resulting conflict cost Panmure in the region of &pound;20,000, and prompted him to strike a deal with Lyon to prevent future contests. In the whole of his forty-seven years as a member of parliament there are no recorded instances of his speaking in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>As the eldest son at his father's death (23 June 1734), Panmure took on the responsibility of regaining the family's forfeited land. During the 1730s he negotiated with the York Buildings Company to buy back the estates, currently leased to Sir Archibald Grant and Garden of Troup on a 29-year tack. Panmure attempted to purchase the lease or to have a superior lease inserted between the York Buildings Company and the existing tenant to strengthen his position should the land come up for sale. The company's disorganized financial situation was such that lengthy and costly legal discussions yielded few tangible results, and it was not until 1763 that his friend Alexander Forrester finally piloted a bill through the House of Commons authorizing the auction of the Panmure estate. In Edinburgh on 20 February 1764 Panmure, the sole bidder, bought back his family estates for &pound;49,157 18<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., somewhat less than the &pound;72,000 that he had estimated. A popular, benevolent, and charitable man, as a landlord Panmure showed considerable interest in his tenants' well-being and in the improvement of his estates. His efforts provide a good example of the rehabilitation of former Jacobite families back into the Scottish landed establishment during the second half of the eighteenth century. Panmure died, unmarried, on 4 January 1782, at which point his estate was entailed to George, eighth earl of Dalhousie, the husband of his sister Jean.<br>
