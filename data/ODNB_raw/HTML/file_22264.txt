<span class="headword">Pilcher,  George</span>  (1801&#150;1855), <span class="occ">ear surgeon</span>, son of Jeremiah Pilcher, of Winkfield, Berkshire, was born on 30 April 1801. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 2 April 1824 and immediately afterwards began to practise as a surgeon in Dean Street, Soho, London. He was appointed lecturer on anatomy, physiology, and surgery at the Webb Street school of medicine, Snow's Fields, Bermondsey, then belonging to his brother-in-law, Richard Dugard Grainger, and became consulting surgeon to the Surrey Dispensary. In 1838 he was awarded the Fothergillian gold medal at the Medical Society of London for a treatise, published as <span class="italic">The Structure, Economy, and Diseases of the Ear</span>, and in 1842 he was elected president of the Medical Society. When the Webb Street school was reabsorbed into the Borough hospitals from which it had emanated, Pilcher became attached to Lane's School, which was affiliated to St George's Hospital, where he became lecturer on surgery in 1843. In the same year he was made one of the first honorary fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and from 1849 until his death he was a member of its council.<br>
<br>Pilcher was an able surgeon and a good physiologist. He played a leading part in raising the standards and status of aural surgery in England. He published three works on the structure, function, and diseases of the ear, which were notable for their attempt to base treatments on thorough anatomical knowledge and good surgical principles.<br>
<br>Pilcher died suddenly, probably of a stroke, on 7 November 1855 at his home, 2 Harley Street, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 14 November.<br>
