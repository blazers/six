<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Mary Ann</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1746, <em>d.</em> in or after 1810), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the only child and heir of an Anglican retired merchant, already past seventy years old when she was born, and his thirty-year-old Roman Catholic wife. Her father, whose forename was James, died when she was two. Mary was educated at the Bar Convent in York, after which she was courted, aged fourteen, by the 35-year-old Joseph Radcliffe: &#145;poor, little me! &hellip; like a bird in a cage, I fluttered to be at liberty&#146;  (Radcliffe, 16). She eloped while visiting London, &#145;And from these transactions &hellip; have I to date the area of my misfortunes&#146;  (ibid., 30). She and Radcliffe married in 1761, and she bore the first of her eight children at fifteen; the last two died young.<br>
<br>After Radcliffe's fortune was withheld by law and her husband's business ventures in London and elsewhere failed, she ran a coffee house, took in lodgers, and chaperoned a pregnant unmarried young lady. Her last spell of living with her husband ended when she sought work as a governess in London. Other jobs included sewing, shopkeeping, and housekeeping from 1781 to 1783 for Mary Stewart, countess of Traquair, an old school friend at whose home Radcliffe met the liberal Catholic theologian and translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> Alexander Geddes.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1810) mentions obliquely the writing of fiction (&#145;was I soaring into the airy regions of fiction, I would quickly change the theme&#146;), but does not mention any of the novels ascribed to her. Although she wanted to remain anonymous, her publisher set her name to her polemic <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> (1799), out of &#145;a view to extend the sale, from the same name at that period standing high amongst the novel readers&#146;  (ibid., 387). Sales strategy and the fame of Ann Radcliffe probably account for other ascriptions and half-ascriptions to Mary Ann Radcliffe, first made in 1802 though some refer to 1790. <span class="italic">Radcliffe's New Novelist's Pocket Magazine</span> published its two numbers as hers in 1802 (giving her current address correctly); the second number credits her with <span class="italic">The Secret Oath</span>, also 1802, a chapbook. The same year a Minerva Press catalogue listed &#145;Mrs. Radcliffe&#146; as author of <span class="italic">The Fate of Velina de Guidova</span> (1790), an epistolary novel; in 1814 another of its catalogues listed &#145;Mrs. Ann Radcliffe&#146; as author of <span class="italic">Radzivil, a Romance</span>, &#145;translated from the Russian of the celebrated M. Wocklow&#146; (1790), whose text speaks of its author, translator (a &#145;young gentleman&#146;), and editor&#150;reviser as all male. In 1809 J. F. Hughes published <span class="italic">Manfron&eacute;, or, The One-Handed Monk</span> as by &#145;Mary Anne Radcliffe&#146;, and switched authorship of <span class="italic">The Mysterious Baron</span> (1808) to her from Eliza Ratcliffe. <span class="italic">Manfron&eacute;</span>, reprinted in 1819, 1825, 1839, [1878], and 1971 as either hers or Ann Radcliffe's, was claimed in a letter to the Royal Literary Fund by Louisa Theresa Bellenden Ker. An extremely gory, high-flown Gothic novel, it is nothing like <span class="italic">Velina</span> or <span class="italic">Radzivil</span>, and none of these novels resembles Mary Ann Radcliffe's known work.<br>
<br>If not a novelist, Radcliffe remains an unusual writer. <span class="italic">The Female Advocate, or, An Attempt to Recover the Rights of Women from Male Usurpation</span> (1799) which, despite advice from Arthur Murphy, led to &#145;an unlucky circumstance &hellip; between the bookseller [Vernor and Hood] and myself&#146;  (Radcliffe, 387), discusses the shrinking female job market and the snare of prostitution; its feeling but down-to-earth tone reflects harsh experience: &#145;All women possess not the Amazonian spirit of a Wolstonecraft; but, indeed, unremitted oppression is sometimes a sufficient apology for their throwing off the gentle garb of a female&#146;  (ibid., 399). The <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> (December 1799) was unwarrantably hostile. Radcliffe's <span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; in Familiar Letters to her Female Friend</span> (which reprints her earlier book) was begun at Portobello near Edinburgh in 1807, finished in dire poverty after five years housebound with rheumatism, and published by subscription in 1810.<br>
