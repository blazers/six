<span class="headword">Oxenbridge,  John</span>  (1608&#150;1674), <span class="occ">preacher and pastor in the West Indies and America</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47342/', "Daniel Oxenbridge (1571&#150;1642)")</script>, physician, and of his wife, Katherine Harby (<i>d</i>. 1651), and grandson to the Northamptonshire puritan radical divine John Oxenbridge (<i>d</i>. 1618), was born at Daventry on 30 January 1608. Admitted a pensioner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 8 April 1626, he matriculated the same year but received his BA from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 13 November 1628 and his MA on 18 June 1631, subsequently becoming a tutor of the college, where the future Unitarian John Biddle was among his students. Laud deprived Oxenbridge in May 1634, after he had required his scholars to sign an oath that regulated their lives and deportment towards him more strictly than required by university statutes.<br>
<br>Oxenbridge left Oxford and about 1635 married his first wife, Jane Butler (<i>c</i>.1621&#150;1658). She was said to be &#145;a schollar beyond what is usual in her sex, and of a masculine judgment in the profound points of religion&#146; and Oxenbridge &#145;loved commonly to have her opinion upon a text of scripture before he preacht from it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 64). The Oxenbridges left England in 1635 for Bermuda, where Oxenbridge provoked controversy with his conventicles and his vigorous catechizing. He and his wife were later said to have planted the seeds of congregationalism on the island.<br>
<br>Oxenbridge returned (in 1641) to England, where he preached in various towns. Having served in 1643 as an assistant to William Bridge at the congregationalist church in Norwich, he proceeded to Beverley, Yorkshire, where he was filling the perpetual curacy of the minister in 1644. In 1648 he was appointed a joint preacher at St Mary's, Beverley, and served as a minister in Beverley and Berwick upon Tweed. On 25 October 1652 he was appointed a fellow of Eton College (perhaps because his sister Elizabeth had married Oliver St John) and on 25 June the next year Cromwell appointed Oxenbridge a member of a new company charged with governing Bermuda. Andrew Marvell boarded with the Oxenbridges in Eton, and it was probably they who inspired him to write his poem &#145;Bermudas&#146;. Marvell wrote a tender epitaph for a memorial slab for Jane Oxenbridge, who died on 25 April 1658 and was buried in Eton chapel, describing her as &#145;with primitive modesty plying the same successful pursuit for souls at home as he abroad&#146;. Anthony Wood, the Oxford antiquary, regarded Oxenbridge as displaying the height of nonconformist hypocrisy in that, although Oxenbridge had vowed eternal love to his first wife, within a year of her death he married a &#145;religious virgin&#146;, Frances Woodward  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.468). Frances died within the year in childbirth and was also buried at Eton.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Oxenbridge was ejected from his Eton fellowship. He published a set of sermons in 1661 to discourage Fifth-Monarchy sentiments, and, having returned to Berwick upon Tweed, preached there until silenced by his refusal to comply with the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662. That year he moved to Surinam in order to propagate the gospel. A letter from him (superscribed Comaween, 29 October 1662) to his wife's brother-in-law, the Newcastle merchant Ambrose Barnes, trying to round up money and settlers, reports that &#145;having many English servants is not good; but some negros, cattle, and Indian trade will bring an ordinary English estate to a comfortable subsistence and use in these parts&#146;. The Indians were more peaceful than elsewhere in the Americas and their language was easily learned, he reported  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 45&#150;6). He published a brief prospectus for propagating the gospel in Surinam, part of a larger manuscript.<br>
<br>Oxenbridge left for Barbados in 1667, perhaps because of the turmoil undergone by Surinam in the Anglo-Dutch War and his own financial and personal losses there. In Barbados his affairs did not prosper either, and in 1669 he moved to Massachusetts. While in Barbados he married his third wife, a widow, Susanna Abbot (<i>d</i>. 1696). Oxenbridge's friend, Thomas Parris, introduced the couple, and it was probably Oxenbridge's presence in Massachusetts that induced Parris to send his son Samuel, later best known for setting off the Salem witchcraft hysteria in 1692, to Harvard.<br>
<br>In Massachusetts, Oxenbridge first preached at the Charlestown church, but he turned down a call there on 25 October 1669 because he had already accepted a call from the First Church of Boston; on 20 January 1670 he and Susanna were made members there. The elderly teacher of the church, John Davenport, having died on 13 March 1670, Oxenbridge was ordained as his replacement on 4 May, and was made a freeman a week later. The First Church was currently at the storm centre of a major controversy over the half-way covenant. This reconceptualization of New England congregationalist church membership allowed members' children who had become parents but who had not testified to a work of grace in their souls to have partial church membership in order to have their own children baptized. The synod of 1662 had endorsed the half-way covenant, with a vocal minority protesting against it as a betrayal of the New England church order. The First Church had sided with the minority, and Oxenbridge continued that alignment. He and his church encouraged like-minded dissidents to resist the installation of a new minister at Newbury and to form their own church at Salem; he preached an election sermon in 1671 denouncing the half-way covenant and advocating tolerance for Baptists, who were admired by his minority of congregationalists because, whatever their errors about baptism, they preserved the purity of church membership; he harassed dissenters who had split from the First Church to form their own church. In 1672 Oxenbridge was appointed one of the licensers of the press. He died on 28 December 1674 of an apoplexy with which he was seized while delivering a sermon.<br>
