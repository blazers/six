<span class="headword">Fairbairn, Sir  Thomas</span>, second baronet  (1823&#150;1891), <span class="occ">art administrator and patron</span>, was born on 18 January 1823 at The Polygon, Ardwick, Manchester, the third of the eight surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9067/', "Sir William Fairbairn, first baronet (1789&#150;1874)")</script>, engineer, and his wife, Dorothy (1788/9&#150;1882), daughter of John Mar of Morpeth. He was educated privately, and in 1840 joined his father's firm, William Fairbairn &amp; Co. This entailed sacrificing an intended university career; however, a ten-month tour of Italy in 1841&#150;2 enabled him to consolidate his interest in the arts. His immediate course lay in the metropolis, where he became the partner in charge of the ailing Millwall shipbuilding works. Although by baptism and upbringing a Unitarian (his father was a stalwart of the famous Cross Street Chapel in Manchester), on 23 March 1848 he married Allison Callaway (1827&#150;1907), the daughter of a London surgeon, in an Anglican church in Greenwich. That year the Millwall concern was sold off at a great loss, but this was absorbed by the Manchester works, which went on to make considerable fortunes for all the partners.<br>
<br>Fairbairn's means enabled him to make a valuable contribution to national life as an art patron, collector, and exhibition organizer. Based in Manchester from 1848, he began buying contemporary works from the exhibitions of the Royal Manchester Institution (where his father was a governor), but seeing the works of William Holman Hunt at the 1853 Royal Academy exhibition was a turning point in the development of his collection. Fairbairn sponsored completion of <span class="italic">The Awakening Conscience</span> (1853&#150;4; Tate collection), the first of his many Hunt purchases. Friendship between the two men channelled the patron's taste towards the Pre-Raphaelites, leading to commissions from Thomas Woolner of a marble statue of Fairbairn's eldest surviving children entitled <span class="italic">Constance and Arthur, or, Deaf and Dumb</span> (1857&#150;62; priv. coll.) and a marble bust of James Brooke, raja of Sarawak (1858; priv. coll.). Through Hunt, Fairbairn bought paintings by John Brett and Robert Braithwaite Martineau, and in 1858 and 1862 commissioned three landscapes from Edward Lear, to whom the Pre-Raphaelite described Fairbairn in early 1860 as a patron who &#145;has really got an immense instinct for what is good in Art which makes him enjoy the right thing when he comes across it&#146;  (Bronkhurst, 597).<br>
<br>As chairman of the great Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, Fairbairn was responsible for its inclusion of the Soulages collection of decorative art; this had been purchased by the committee for &pound;13,500 and was sold on to the South Kensington Museum (later the V&amp;A) from 1859 to 1865. The chairman was deeply involved in the selection of contemporary pictures, and, by putting Augustus Egg in charge of their hanging, Fairbairn ensured that progressive artists as well as academicians were well represented. For the first time in Britain, Pre-Raphaelite art was widely shown, while the old master exhibits were arranged chronologically, with Italian art hung opposite other paintings of the same date. Having refused the offer of a knighthood for his efforts, in January 1860 Fairbairn launched a campaign to establish a free art gallery and museum in Manchester, as &#145;a sure means of strengthening the feelings of mutual regard and dependence which, in a free and advancing country, knits the different ranks and interests of society together&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 25 Sept 1860, 3). Fairbairn was no stranger to class conflict: his series of letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> under the pseudonym Amicus had championed the employers' cause in the Manchester lock-out strike of 1851&#150;2.<br>
<br>The museum project foundered, and Fairbairn channelled his energies into the metropolitan art world, as a member of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 (to which he was elected in May 1861), and as commissioner for the International Exhibition of 1862 with responsibility for the fine art department. About this time he acquired Burton Park, near Petworth in Sussex; <span class="italic">The Children's Holiday</span> (Torre Abbey, Torquay), the group portrait of his wife and five children commissioned from Holman Hunt in 1864, was probably painted to hang at the head of the staircase there. Furnishing both a London and a country establishment accelerated the pace of his collecting. Records of his acquisitions indicate that his taste was very catholic&#151;an inventory of 1870 lists paintings by Constable, Turner, Richard Wilson, and Zoffany, by contemporary French artists, and by academicians such as Frederick Goodall and Thomas Creswick, as well as those of the British avant-garde.<br>
<br>By July 1866 Fairbairn had moved to Brambridge House, Bishopstoke, near Southampton, and four years later he was appointed high sheriff of Hampshire. The portrait which he commissioned from Holman Hunt in 1873 (priv. coll.) memorably conveys his thickset and imposing appearance. Its backdrop was of the interior of the South Kensington Museum&#151;an apt reflection of his role as commissioner for the international exhibitions of 1851, 1862, 1867, and 1871. After he succeeded to the baronetcy in 1874, the depression in the iron industry led Fairbairn to wind up the Fairbairn Engineering Company. He now employed his administrative abilities as a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Hampshire. In 1889 he gave up his London home at 42 Wilton Place, Belgravia, and retired to Brambridge House, where he died of a stroke on 12 August 1891; he was buried six days later at Twyford church. Bequests in his will included gifts presented to him by the emperor Napoleon III, the crown prince of Prussia, and the emperor of Austria, in recognition of his role as promoter of the arts. No provision was made for his extensive art collection to remain intact, and some of his pictures were auctioned at Phillips on 3 May 1892. A further sale took place at Christies on 2 March 1895.<br>
