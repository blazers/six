<span class="headword">Simson,  Archibald</span>  (1564&#150;1628), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25601/', "Andrew Simson (c.1526&#150;1591?)")</script>, minister of Dalkeith, Edinburghshire, and Violet Adamson, sister of Patrick Adamson (1537&#150;1592), archbishop of St Andrews. Of his six brothers, five became ministers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25605/', "Patrick Simson (1556&#150;1618)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25608/', "William Simson (b. 1562, d. in or after 1623)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25600/', "Alexander Simson (1570&#150;1639)")</script>; he also had three sisters. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, graduating MA in 1585. In the following year he was appointed assistant to his father and was clerk to the presbytery of Dalkeith in 1588. He succeeded to the latter charge in 1590. On 1 February 1604 Archibald married Katherine Crichton; the couple had three daughters, Christian, Elizabeth, and Jean. Following Katherine's death (before 10 February 1607), Archibald married, on 26 September 1607, Elizabeth Stewart.<br>
<br>A convinced presbyterian, Simson was a constant opponent of James VI's attempts to impose royal authority over the general assembly of the kirk. In 1605 he supported the actions of those ministers who convened at Aberdeen, in defiance of the king's express command. Although their arrival was delayed by inclement weather, he and several other ministers &#145;finding the Assemblie dissolved &hellip; went to the place where the Assemblie was holdin, and &hellip; tooke instruments &hellip; that were come to have keeped the said Assemblie; and &hellip; they did ratifie all the proceedings therof&#146;  (Calderwood, <span class="italic">History</span>, 6.444). Having thus incurred the king's wrath Simson was summoned before the privy council, but was dismissed after promising to moderate his future behaviour. This undertaking, however, was short lived. Simson appeared before the privy council on similar charges in December 1606 after having protested that a convention of ministers at Linlithgow&#151;&#145;convocated at his majestie's desire&#146;&#151;should not be regarded as a lawful substitute for a &#145;free Generall Assemblie&#146;  (ibid., 606&#150;7).<br>
<br>The issue continued to occupy Simson, and&#151;in June 1617&#151;he objected to the proposal that &#145;whatever his majestie should determine in the external government of the church, with the advice of the archbishops [and] bishops &hellip; should have the force of law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 11.166). The intended legislation raised presbyterian hackles, since it threatened the institution of a system &#145;resembl[ing] the convocatioun hous in England&#146; and would inevitably &#145;prejudice the libertie of our generall assemblies&#146;  (Calderwood, &#145;Trew relatioun&#146;, fol. 8<i>v</i>). Consequently fifty-five ministers submitted a &#145;protestatioun&#146; against the scheme, and the proposal was rejected by parliament. The weight of James's resentment fell on the document's principal author, David Calderwood, minister of Crailing, and on Simson, who had acted as &#145;scribe&#146;. On 12 July, Simson was summoned before the court of high commission, deprived of his charge, and banished to Aberdeen. As before, Simson (probably on the advice of his brother) admitted his offence, and was restored to his parish in December.<br>
<br>Thus Simson emerged relatively unscathed from his encounters with royal authority. Undoubtedly this was due to the influence of his brother Patrick, who was himself a conspicuous opponent of episcopacy. Nevertheless, it was the latter who prevailed upon his brother to &#145;tolerate&#146; the bishops  (Calderwood, <span class="italic">History</span>, 7.129) and&#151;no doubt&#151;also instilled in him the commonly held belief that an unjust sentence might be admitted, &#145;howbeit ye do not acknowledge it&#146;  (Calderwood, &#145;Trew relatioun&#146;, fol. 4<i>v</i>). Archibald's fervent prayer that God might reinforce &#145;that gift [of toleration] in thir dayes of defection&#146; reflected not only his respect for his brother's advice, but also his determination not to join those of his fellow ministers who &#145;for fear or gain fall into earthly dispositione&#146;  (Wodrow, 125). His own faith can only have been strengthened by the fact that in April 1618 he had to preach Patrick's funeral sermon after dark, &#145;being silenced and stay[ed] to preach publickly by the persecution of the Prelats&#146;  (ibid., 115). But Archibald Simson's principled presbyterianism, tempered by tolerance and common sense, earned him friends in high places. His continued nonconformity attracted the attention of the high commission at Edinburgh in June 1620, but, on the intercession of William, earl of Morton, he was excused. Even after Patrick's death, therefore, he was able to retain both his religious principles and his charge.<br>
<br>Simson dedicated the last years of his life to writing, and published several sermons, including <span class="italic">Christes Testament Unfolded, or, Seaven Sermons, on Our Lords Seaven Last Words</span> (1620), <span class="italic">Heptameron, the Seven Dayes</span> (1621), <span class="italic">Samson's Seaven Lockes of Haire: Allegorically Expounded</span> (St Andrews, 1621), and <span class="italic">A Godly and Fruitfull Exposition on the Twenty Five Psalmes</span> (1622). In the course of his writings Simson remembered those whose help had sustained him through difficult times. His <span class="italic">Hieroglyphica animalium terrestrium</span> (1622), for example, contained three Latin poems written by his friend and colleague Patrick Turner, minister of Borthwick and son-in-law of James Law, archbishop of Glasgow, and <span class="italic">A Sacred Septenarie, or, A Godly and Fruitfill Exposition on the Seven Psalmes of Repentance</span> (1623), was dedicated to William, earl of Morton. Simson's more tendentious works, &#145;Historia ecclesiastica Scotorum&#146; and &#145;Annales ecclesiae Scoticanae&#146; (NL Scot., Adv. MSS), were probably written during this period of Simson's life, but, due to the difficulty of the times, were never published. Simson died, probably at Dalkeith, in December 1628. His wife survived him.<br>
