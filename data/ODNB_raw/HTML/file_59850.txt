<span class="headword">Earl,  George Samuel Windsor</span>  (1813&#150;1865), <span class="occ">colonist and geographer</span>, the son of a veteran sea captain and shipowner, Percy Earl (1771&#150;1827), and his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharp (1778/9&#150;1874), was born at Hampstead, Middlesex, on 10 February 1813. His brief formal education was at the Revd John Stephenson's school at Orpington and at Dr Alexander Jamieson's Wyke House Academy until his father's death in June 1827. Later that year, aged fourteen, he made a voyage to India as midshipman on the <i>Lady Holland</i>, returning to England in March 1829. In August of that year he took ship for Swan River Colony on the <i>Egyptian</i> with the intention of becoming a farmer with his elder brother, William Percy, who arrived later with four indentured servants and some sheep.<br>
<br>Finding that the 200 acres allocated to him on the lower Swan were unsuitable, Earl spent some time exploring the coast before going south to Augusta. There he was employed as clerk to the resident, Captain John Molloy, and was assigned town land. In February 1832 he sailed 150 miles in an open boat to Fremantle to seek relief supplies for the struggling settlement. Deciding that there was no future for him in the colony, he took ship in August for Batavia (Jakarta), learning the Malay language and the rudiments of navigation while on board. During the next two years he served as chief officer on trading voyages to the Malay states and Thailand as well as ports in Java, becoming proficient in Bugis, Bajau, and Macassarese. In March 1834, on behalf of some Singapore Chinese merchants, he took an 80 ton schooner, the <i>Stamford</i>, with a cargo of opium, tea, and iron to the west Borneo port of Singkawang in the hope of breaking the Dutch trade embargo. During this time he visited the Chinese gold-mining <i>gongsi</i> (co-operative autonomous community) at Montrado.<br>
<br>On returning to England in early 1835, when he was still only twenty-one, Earl became involved in agitation for a British settlement in northern Australia. Elected as a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society after an address to its members, his authority on the area was further strengthened by his pamphlet <span class="italic">Observations on the Commercial and Agricultural Capabilities of the North Coast of New Holland</span> (1836) and his book, <span class="italic">The Eastern Seas</span> (1837). This important work also described north-western Borneo in detail for the first time, and led to the visit there by James Brooke in 1839. Indeed, it seems likely that Brooke asked him to join his party. Instead, in late 1837 Earl was appointed linguist and draughtsman with the north Australia expedition under Sir J. J. Gordon Bremer. From October 1838 he was based at the garrison settlement of Port Essington, which he had advocated as a &#145;second Singapore&#146;, to tap the trade of eastern Indonesia. In 1844 he was appointed crown lands commissioner and police magistrate. During his five years at Port Essington he made several voyages to the islands to the north to obtain supplies. He also developed a knowledge of the Aboriginal peoples of the Cobourg peninsula.<br>
<br>Suffering from malaria and dysentery, Earl returned to England on leave in September 1844 and completed <span class="italic">Enterprise in Tropical Australia</span> (1846), a historical account of the Port Essington settlement with chapters on the climate, flora, and fauna of northern Australia and the prospects of growing cotton there using Asian labour. While in London he met, and later married on 4 April 1846, sixteen-year-old Clara, daughter of the Waterloo veteran and historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25504/', "Captain William Siborne")</script> of the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea. He also gave a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society on the Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia. Later that year he and Clara sailed to Sydney to settle the affairs of his brother, who had drowned at sea in April <i>en route</i> for Port Essington. After the birth of their only child, Elisabeth Christiana, in Sydney in the following year they travelled via Hong Kong to Singapore, where Earl was admitted as a law agent in April 1849. He also contributed articles on a wide range of subjects to the lawyer and antiquary J. F. Logan's <span class="italic">Journal of the Indian Archipelago</span> and began work on a major ethnographical undertaking. <span class="italic">Native Races of the Indian Archipelago: the Papuans</span> was published in London in 1853, where he spent the years 1852&#150;4 in poor health but cheered by his election as one of the first corresponding members of the Ethnological Society. In 1853 he became involved in a public controversy with Sir Roderick Murchison as to who first anticipated the discovery of gold in New South Wales in 1851. This brought him to the attention of the engineer and antiquary Hyde Clarke, and to a spell as agent on the New South Wales and Victoria goldfields for the Berdan Pan, a gold ore processing machine patented by the American inventor Colonel Hiram Berdan. When this failed to make his fortune, he returned with his family to Singapore in mid-1855.<br>
<br>Appointed magistrate and third assistant resident councillor for Singapore in 1857, Earl then took Thomas Braddell's place in Penang for a year as senior assistant resident councillor before moving to Province Wellesley on the mainland to a similar post. In early 1864, while visiting Adelaide with his wife and daughter for the latter's marriage to the Anglo-Irish merchant William Alt, he influenced the South Australian government in its choice of Adam Bay, near the mouth of the Adelaide River, as the site for the capital of its newly acquired Northern Territory. Earl spent his remaining years as resident councillor and police magistrate in Penang and Province Wellesley. Retaining his keen interest in northern Australia, in 1863 he published <span class="italic">A Handbook for Colonists in Tropical Australia</span>. Despite deteriorating health, he offered to lead a rescue party when the first South Australian expedition to Adam Bay was a failure. He died of dysentery on 9 August 1865 when about to return to England, and was buried at Penang the following day. There is a monument to him there and also an Earl family commemorative stone at St John's, Hampstead. An imperialist in the tradition of Dalrymple and Raffles, Earl was a gifted hydrographer, geographer, linguist, and ethnographer, and an effective publicist in the cause of northern Australian settlement. He coined the term &#145;Indonesia&#146; in the context of linguistic groupings.<br>
