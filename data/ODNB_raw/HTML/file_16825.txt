<span class="headword">Lloyd,  David</span>  (1597&#150;1663), <span class="occ">poet and dean of St Asaph</span>, was born in Berth-lwyd, in the parish of Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire, the son of David Lloyd. His uncle was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and held the post of dean of Hereford from 1617 until his death in 1625 at the age of fifty-four. There is also record of a brother called Oliver (<i>d</i>. 1662), a doctor of law, who was also a fellow of All Souls, and who, like his brother, suffered deprivation during the interregnum. Lloyd entered Hart Hall, Oxford, on 30 October 1612, graduating BA on 22 June 1615. He was elected a fellow of All Souls in 1618, obtaining a BCL in 1622 (probably in May) and a DCL on 26 March 1628, having been incorporated at Cambridge in 1616.<br>
<br>Lloyd is chiefly notable for his bawdy mock epic poem, <span class="italic">The Legend of Captain Jones</span> (1631), which is his only surviving literary work, although Anthony Wood suggests that he also wrote songs, sonnets, and elegies, &#145;some of which are printed in several books&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.653). These have not been discovered. <span class="italic">The Legend</span> tells the story of a famous Elizabethan sailor who performed many spectacular feats of military prowess with his sword, Kyl-za-dog. He killed the mighty giant Asdriasdust and fought off the eleven kings who sought to bar his progress, before being captured by the king of Spain, who lost 6000 warriors in the process. He was immediately ransomed by his loyal countrymen. Andrew Marvell refers to this burlesque poem in <span class="italic">The Rehearsal Transprosed</span> (1672&#150;3), suggesting that forty years after its first publication it had become a byword for ridiculous and comic exaggeration. Certainly the existence of separate and revised editions in 1636, 1648, 1656 (containing a frontispiece of Jones on horseback confronting an Indian king mounted on an elephant), and 1659 indicates considerable popularity, and imitations and sequels were published in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Legend</span> is almost certainly not based on a real figure but may refer to various Elizabethan soldiers such as Sir John Norris or Sir Thomas Arundell. It is undoubtedly a pastiche or parody of a Welsh poem, <span class="italic">Awdl foliant Rhisiart Si&ocirc;n o Fuellt</span> (&#145;Ode in Praise of Rhisiart Si&ocirc;n of Buellt&#146;) by Si&ocirc;n Tudur, a prominent Welsh bard who later lived in Lloyd's diocese of St Asaph. It is also likely that the poem satirizes the boastful and legendary autobiographical accounts of Captain John Smith's exploits in the Americas, which were published in the 1620s and 1630s. The expanded version of Lloyd's poem published in 1656 makes the satirical relationship clearer, probably because Smith died in 1632 and Lloyd felt less constrained in his parodic intentions.<br>
<br>In 1639 Lloyd became chaplain to William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby, and also controller of his household. He was made a canon of Chester the same year before becoming rector of Trefdraeth, Anglesey, on 2 December 1641. He was subsequently made vicar of Llangynhafal, and, on 21 December of the same year, vicar of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd. He also became warden of Ruthin, Denbighshire, in 1642. During the civil war he was deprived of his offices and imprisoned for a time by the Long Parliament. He was reinstated after the Restoration and promoted to the deanery of St Asaph, and then presented to one of the two comportions of Llansannan in 1662. Lloyd's plea to the king for his reinstatement, dated August 1660, claims that he did all he could for the king and church, having entertained princes Rupert and Maurice and Charles I himself on one occasion. He also claims that he was robbed as well as imprisoned by the parliamentary forces. Another letter, dated 16 October 1660, signifies the election of George Griffith to the see of St Asaph, after the death of Dr John Owen. Lloyd died on 7 September 1663 at Ruthin, although no monument remains. A humorous epitaph represents him as running into debt through his love of eating:<blockquote>
<div>This is the epigraph,<br>
</div>
<div>Of the dean of St. Asaph,<br>
</div>
<div>Who by keeping a table,<br>
</div>
<div>Better than he was able,<br>
</div>
<div>Run into debt<br>
</div>
<div>Which is not paid yet.<br>
</div> (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.653)</blockquote>
