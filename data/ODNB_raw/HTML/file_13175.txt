<span class="headword">Heyrick,  Richard</span>  (1600&#150;1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London on 25 May 1600, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13076/', "Sir William Herrick (Heyrick) (bap. 1562, d. 1653)")</script>, a London goldsmith and alderman, and his wife, Joan Mary (or May). In 1614 he entered Merchant Taylors', London, the school attended by his lifelong friend and career associate, Thomas Case, and in 1617 entered as a fellow-commoner St John's College, Oxford, from where he graduated BA in 1619 and proceeded MA in 1622 and BD at some undisclosed date. On 14 January 1625, he was chosen a fellow of All Souls: a crucial factor in obtaining this prize was the king's recommendation, which, in turn, should be traced to his father's loans to the crown. About this time Heyrick was ordained and on 9 June 1626 he took up the benefice of North Repps, near Cromer, in Norfolk, where Case served as his curate. Heyrick married in Norfolk, probably soon afterwards, Helen (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of Thomas Corbet of the county, with whom he had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Like Case, Heyrick developed a career interest in the Manchester area. Indeed, his life exemplifies a certain tension between high principle and ambitious careerism. Perhaps on 14 November 1626, Charles I awarded him the reversion of the wardenship of Manchester's collegiate church, a position whose value was estimated variously at between &pound;700 and &pound;70. For Heyrick to secure this position when it became vacant in 1635 required not only a powerfully composed petition from him but also intervention by Archbishop William Laud&#151;high-church patronage which seems ironic in the light of his subsequent career. Heyrick combined the wardenship with other church appointments in Cheshire and near Manchester.<br>
<br>Despite his secure position within the church establishment, from the time of his appointment as warden Heyrick &#145;quickly assumed a leading role in Lancashire puritanism&#146;  (Richardson, 45n.). He attacked puritanism's adversary Catholicism from at least 1638 and in 1641 was preaching vehemently against Lancashire's &#145;infectious&#146; &#145;Popery &hellip; multiplied abundantly&#146; as a result of Catholic gentry patronage. His strident anti-episcopal tone aligned him with the Long Parliament, which in 1642 made him one of the two Lancashire ministers to be consulted on ecclesiastical affairs, and by 1643 he had emerged as a proponent of the presbyterian form of church government. This in Lancashire crystallized out of earlier puritanism which was centred on Manchester, &#145;a town famous for religion ever since the Reformation&#146; as Heyrick himself put it  (Richardson, 9&#150;10), where prototypes of presbyterian church organization were created both in the 1580s and 1630s. With a ministerial colleague Heyrick was also appointed by parliament to look into the doctrines and financing of the Lancashire clergy.<br>
<br>By the mid-1640s Heyrick's activities were divided between Lancashire and London, where he was principally occupied as a member of the presbyterian-dominated Westminster assembly of divines. However, when in the north-west, while prominent in the establishment of the presbyterian system in 1646, Heyrick at that time declared himself &#145;so perfect a Lattitidinarian that the Episcopall, Presbyterians and Independents might all preache, yet each by Divine right&#146;  (Shaw, 2.13): although his attitude offended clergy of the region who sought a more exclusively presbyterian form of church government, Heyrick's remarks were aimed at devising a comprehensive ecclesiastical system to embrace mainstream protestants, probably with the aim of countering Lancashire's deeply embedded Catholicism. Yet in a fast sermon, of the same year, <span class="italic">Queen Esthers Resolves</span> (1646), he pleased his audience of MPs with his thunder against &#145;the Tyranny of Prelacy&#146;, meaning episcopal Anglicanism  (<span class="italic">Fast Sermons</span>, 23.342). The authorship of the harmonious consent of 1648, an accord between London and Lancashire presbyterian ministers on upholding the presbyterian solemn league and covenant and suppressing dissidence, is attributed either to him or to his ministerial colleague, Richard Hollinworth (<i>bap</i>. 1607, <i>d</i>. 1656).<br>
<br>Heyrick's presbyterian&#150;parliamentarian views stopped well short of a republican position and in April 1647 he lodged a strong protest when, at a meeting of clergy of the area, a proposal in favour of government without a king was mooted. Until the beginning of the 1650s these political convictions did him no harm and when the Manchester collegiate church was dissolved in 1650 he was compensated with the award of a pension of &pound;100 a year out of sold college lands. In the following year, though, along with Case, he was imprisoned for his involvement in Christopher Love's presbyterian&#150;royalist plot: he may have been spared disaster as a result of association between Cromwell and the north-western presbyterian lay leader George Booth. By 1654 he was back in favour and on the Lancashire commission for ejecting unworthy ministers and teachers, and in 1658 he was involved in a controversy over presbyterian excommunication.<br>
<br>Although Heyrick did not actively support Booth's 1659 royalist rising, he was, predictably, an ardent advocate of the Restoration, at which point powerful patronage, this time in the person of the presbyterian-inclined second earl of Manchester, came to his aid to reinvest him with the wardenship. He seems to have refused the anti-presbyterian oaths in the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662 but he did not scruple to use the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, while his bold claim that the warden's post had been granted to him inalienably in discharge of royal debts succeeded in keeping him in place.<br>
<br>Heyrick died in Manchester on 6 August 1667, a wealthy man in money (&pound;1095) and acreage. His second wife, Anna Maria, daughter of Erasmus Breton of Hamburg, with whom he had had four daughters and two sons, commissioned a &#145;comely monument&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.780) in the collegiate church where he was buried on 9 August, with a florid Latin tribute by Thomas Case. This memorial gave Heyrick a reputation for indifference to preferment. Cast as an &#145;amiable man&#146;  (Raines, 127), he was in fact a combative careerist capable of pressing home his own case with great force and possessed a knack of finding influential patrons at key moments of his career. At the same time, though, Heyrick was a vigorous and eloquent preacher, whose sermons could be both earnest and learned.<br>
