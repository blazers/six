<span class="headword">Conybeare,  John Josias</span>  (1779&#150;1824), <span class="occ">geologist, antiquary, and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 10 June 1779 at St Botolph's rectory, Bishopsgate, London, elder son of the then rector, William Conybeare (1739&#150;1815), and his wife, Margaret Hester Olivier (1764&#150;1806). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6129/', "William Daniel Conybeare (1787&#150;1857)")</script> was his younger brother. He attended Westminster School (where he was captain of school) before going up to Christ Church, Oxford. There he won the chancellor's prize in 1800, graduating BA in 1801 and MA in 1804. From 1808 until 1812 he was professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, and from 1812 until 1821 professor of poetry.<br>
<br>Conybeare was ordained on 13 June 1802, prebendary of York from 1803, and in 1812 became vicar of Batheaston, in Somerset. He resided there from 1814 and much improved the parish, erecting a national school in the churchyard (1818) and a chemical laboratory at the front of his vicarage. He married Mary (1790&#150;1848), only daughter of the Revd Charles Davies (1742&#150;1810), on 21 February 1814.<br>
<br>Conybeare was an early enthusiast for both chemistry and geology. He set up his own laboratory in Oxford in 1804, and published fourteen scientific papers&#151;the most significant of his geology papers concerning Devon and Cornwall. He was one of the original honorary members of the Geological Society of London and, between 1807 and 1812, visited many English counties, probably with his brother, gathering geological data with which he constructed rudimentary geological maps. He was a member of the Revd Richard Warner's Bath Literary Breakfasts, and was also, according to the surveyor R. C. Taylor (1789&#150;1851), one of a triumvirate of local clerics who there supported the geologist William Smith and helped disseminate his results.<br>
<br>Conybeare died suddenly of apoplexy, on 11 June 1824 at the house of Stephen Groombridge at Blackheath, having just delivered the Bampton lectures for 1824 at Oxford. He was buried at Batheaston on 20 June. News of his sudden death confused many, including Robert Bakewell (1768&#150;1843) in England and Benjamin Silliman (1779&#150;1864) in America. They both assumed this death was that of his brother W. D. Conybeare, who thus has the melancholy distinction of having had his death announced prematurely twice. The Society of Antiquaries, which had published &#145;endless Anglo Saxon texts&#146;  (Evans, 235) for Conybeare from 1811 to 1823, still felt able to encourage the posthumous publication in 1826 of his <span class="italic">Illustrations of Anglo-Saxon Poetry</span>, edited by his brother. The early death of Conybeare, who &#145;was considered one of the most learned men of his day&#146;  (Mitchell, 332), was widely mourned.<br>
