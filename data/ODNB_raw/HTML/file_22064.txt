<span class="headword">Pettingall,  John</span>  (1707/8&#150;1781), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, the son of the Revd Francis Pettingall. He attended the grammar school in Newport before matriculating from Jesus College, Oxford, on 15 March 1725, aged seventeen. He graduated BA in 1728 and was later incorporated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he received the degree of MA (1740); he later proceeded DD from Lambeth. He was ordained priest at Llandaff on 5 March 1732 and for a while served as chaplain to the bishop of Llandaff, Richard Watson. He was rector of Whitsun, and vicar of Christchurch, both in Monmouthshire, until 1756. On 3 June 1757 he was appointed a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral and on 28 July 1758 was installed prebendary of Lincoln. He appears to have been the incumbent preacher at Duke Street Chapel in Westminster until his preferment to the rectory of Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Pettingall was a keen antiquarian and in 1752 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He wrote several works on Roman artefacts and early British coins, and published a study of the use of the jury system in Greek and Roman society. He read three papers before the Society of Antiquaries which were later published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, together with another paper on a deed issued by Bishop Odo of Bayeux. He also translated A. C. F. Houtteville's <span class="italic">Discours historique et critique sur la m&eacute;thode des principaux auteurs qui ont &eacute;crit pour ou contre le Christianisme</span>, which he published in 1739 with an appendix entitled &#145;A dissertation on the life of Apollonius Tyaneus, with some observations on the Platonists of the later school&#146;. Pettingall, who was married to Susanna Long of the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, died at Stoke Hammond on 30 June 1781 and was buried in the churchyard there on 2 July. His son <a name="cosubject_22065"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Pettingall</span>  (1744/5&#150;1826), a <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and tutor</span>, was educated at Westminster School from about 1756, where he became a king's scholar in 1758, and at Christ Church, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 9 June 1762, aged seventeen. He graduated BA (1766) and proceeded MA (1769) and BD (1778). He was briefly an usher at his old school (1770&#150;73) but returned to his college to take up a post as tutor and censor from 1774 to 1779. He was appointed rector of East Hampstead, Berkshire, in 1782 and died at Bagshot, Surrey, on 8 April 1826.<br>
