<span class="headword">Sandile</span>  (<em>c.</em>1820&#150;1878), <span class="occ">chief of the Ngqika Xhosa</span>, son of Chief Ngqika and his great wife, Sutu, was born in independent Xhosa near the later Fort Beaufort in South Africa. He was installed as chief in 1842 and led the Ngqika Xhosa until his death in battle in 1878. In accordance with Xhosa custom he had several wives and many children. His great wife was Nopasi, the daughter of the Mpondomise chief Myeki and the mother of his great son and heir, Gonya. Although the elder son of the great wife, Sandile was not the eldest son of his father. On Ngqika's premature death in 1828 Sandile was still a minor and the regency was assumed by Maqoma, his elder brother by a junior wife of Ngqika. Relations between the brothers were never good. Maqoma was more forceful both intellectually and physically, but he was also very erratic, and Sandile gradually managed to assert his authority. Shortly before Sandile was born Ngqika was dispossessed of his ancestral lands around the Kat River by Governor Lord Charles Somerset. This grievance gave rise to the 1834&#150;5 Cape Frontier War during Maqoma's regency, and to the 1846&#150;7 Cape Frontier War (known as &#145;the war of the axe&#146;) shortly after Sandile had assumed power. This war ended abruptly when Sandile, who had voluntarily entered the British camp to conduct negotiations, was treacherously imprisoned. His country was annexed to the British crown under the name of British Kaffraria, and the new governor, Sir Harry Smith, embarked on a policy of humiliating the Xhosa chiefs and taking over their powers.<br>
<br>A crisis erupted in 1850 with the emergence of a Xhosa prophet and witch-finder named Mlanjeni. Sandile refused to attend a meeting called by Smith for fear of being imprisoned a second time, and was immediately deposed by the British. This triggered the 1850&#150;53 Cape Frontier War, the longest and most brutal ever fought on that frontier. Sandile lost more territory, and these losses were compounded as a result of the prophecies of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53747/', "Nongqawuse")</script> in 1856&#150;7. Sandile wavered for a long time, but finally committed himself to the prophecies and slaughtered the last of his remaining cattle. The starvation which followed reduced the population of British Kaffraria by two-thirds, from 105,000 to 37,500. Although Sandile escaped imprisonment, his power was broken, and for nearly twenty years he existed as a mere cipher, drinking heavily and clinging ever harder to traditional customs. But in 1877, when King Sarhili of the Gcaleka branch of the Xhosa became embroiled in a war against the British, Sandile rallied to his cause. He entrenched himself in the Isidenge forests near the town of Stutterheim and refused to give up, even after Sarhili himself had surrendered. Sandile was wounded in a skirmish on 29 May 1878, and died of his wounds a few days later. He was buried in the forest on 9 June. Some controversy has arisen concerning the fate of his body, more especially because Lieutenant F. Carrington returned to Britain with a skull reputed to be that of Sandile. It is probable, however, that his body was buried intact. In 1972 a memorial was erected over the grave site.<br>
<br>Sandile was physically not a strong man, having been born with a club foot. Colonial sources portray him, moreover, as weak-willed and unintelligent. Xhosa oral tradition, however, remembers Sandile with respect and affection. He was one of the few Xhosa chiefs to consistently resist the colonial occupation, and the only one to actually die in battle. As a chief he was generous and unassertive, sensitive to the will of his people and always articulating their aspirations rather than his own.<br>
