<span class="headword">Ellison,  Gerald Alexander</span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born on 19 August 1910 at the vicarage, 9 Park Street, New Windsor, Berkshire, in the family of three sons and two daughters of the Revd John Henry Joshua Ellison (1855&#150;1944), Church of England clergyman, and his second wife, Sara Dorothy Graham, daughter of Walter Ewing Crum. He was named Gerald Crum Ellison at birth, but shortly afterwards the middle name Alexander was substituted for Crum. He had a half-brother by his father's first marriage, to a daughter of Archbishop Tait. At the time of his birth his father was, and had been since 1894, vicar of Windsor (as his father, Canon Ellison, founder of the Church of England Temperance Society, had been), but from 1913 he was rector of St Michael Cornhill. He was at various times chaplain to Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, archbishops Tait and Davidson, the London stock exchange, and the lord mayor of London.<br>
<br>Ellison was educated at St George's choir school, Windsor, where the foundations were laid of his lifelong love of music and his very considerable expertise, and he always retained his love of the chapel. From there he went to Westminster School, where he learned to row. At New College, Oxford, he was soon a member of the Oxford boat. He rowed in the university races of 1932 and 1933, but stood down in 1934, when he was president, due to lack of form. He retained his lifelong association with rowing and on occasion umpired the boat race and judged at Henley regatta. He graduated with a third-class degree in politics, philosophy, and economics in 1932. He then went to Westcott House, Cambridge, and was ordained deacon in 1935 and priest in 1936.<br>
<br>From 1935 to 1937 Ellison was curate at Sherborne Abbey. From there he went to be chaplain to Cyril Garbett, bishop of Winchester. On the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered at once for the navy and left Winchester at Christmas 1939, as Garbett recorded in his diary: &#145;he has been a first-rate chaplain &hellip; and will go a long way if life and health are spared. I shall miss him terribly&#146;  (Garbett diaries, York Minster Library, COLL/82/5). In the navy he was chaplain to the battleship <i>Barham</i> in the Mediterranean, but after a disagreement with the captain over some alterations to divine service, he was posted to the cruiser <i>Orion</i>, on which he took part in the battle of Cape Matapan, and was mentioned in dispatches. His firmness over the incident on <i>Barham</i> probably saved his life, for she was subsequently sunk with great loss of life, including that of his successor.<br>
<br>In 1943 Garbett, who by then had become archbishop of York, obtained Ellison's release from the navy, and he went to Bishopthorpe as chaplain. Although he spent only three years there, they were very important, one might say seminal, in his development, and years later when bishop of London he could introduce himself in the vestry of St Paul's to Archbishop Runcie's chaplain with: &#145;I am the life-president of the Slope club&#146; (a reference to the Revd Obadiah Slope, chaplain to Dr Proudie, Trollopian bishop of Barchester). It was not an easy appointment, as Garbett was a very different bishop from his predecessor, William Temple, and Ellison had to use all his tact in interpreting the new archbishop to a bewildered and sometimes unhappy diocese. The courage which he had displayed in standing up to the captain of <i>Barham</i> was also called for in standing up to the archbishop, who could sometimes be somewhat overbearing.<br>
<br>From Bishopthorpe Ellison went in 1946 to St Mark's, Portsea. While there he married, on 18 June 1947, Jane Elizabeth, the daughter of Brigadier John Houghton Gibbon, army officer. She became one of the pillars of his life. They had two daughters and a son. St Mark's was at that time almost the next step to a bishopric, and it was no surprise when in 1950 he was appointed suffragan of Willesden in the diocese of London, and after five years there became bishop of Chester in 1955. Many thought that he would proceed to Lambeth, but preferment at all levels in the Church of England is very much a matter of luck and politics, and he remained at Chester for the next eighteen years.<br>
<br>While bishop of Chester, Ellison played a leading role in the church assembly during the debates on the Paul report (drawn up by the distinguished sociologist Leslie Paul), which he saw as destroying the parochial system in the Church of England. He was largely responsible for its rejection. It was soon a moot point whether he was right, for within twenty years the situation had changed out of all recognition, and it is not clear to what extent Paul's suggested reforms would have been of any great help. While bishop of Chester, Ellison also chaired the Archbishop's Commission on Women and Holy Orders (1963&#150;6), and although women had nearly thirty years to wait before they could be ordained in the Church of England, he was convinced that it was right, a view from which he never wavered.<br>
<br>In 1973 Ellison moved to London as its bishop, remaining there until his retirement in 1981. He was concurrently dean of the chapels royal, prelate of the Order of the British Empire, and episcopal canon of Jerusalem. As bishop of London he made a series of appointments which proved that he was not the arch-conservative that he was so often believed to be. Two of his suffragans were committed socialists, and all three of his appointments subsequently became diocesans. His lasting memorial in London was the area system, which he started to work on almost as soon as he arrived; with, at that time, more than five hundred parishes, the diocese was too large for one bishop, so he devolved a substantial amount of power to the five suffragans, and was scrupulous in not interfering with their decisions. He played a key role at the church commissioners, where he usually took the chair when the archbishop was not able to be present. He also became the spokesman for all church legislative matters in the House of Lords, where his meticulous preparation and grasp of detail made a great contribution. He was a uniquely respected figure there, and there was some talk of a life peerage when he retired, but lack of precedent was too strong; instead he was appointed KCVO. In the synod he became a more and more important figure, and his magisterial speeches, delivered in his strong firm voice, and not without humour, carried great weight; he played a particularly important role in the passage of the <span class="roman">Worship and Doctrine Measure, 1975</span>, paving the way for liturgical reform. With all this he also had a deep pastoral side to his character; as Lady Du Cann noted, &#145;he practised the Good Samaritan&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Nov 1992).<br>
<br>After Ellison's retirement in 1981 the archbishop of Canterbury asked him to go to Bermuda as vicar-general, to set up a new constitution for the diocese. This he did with his usual efficiency and dispatch. He retired to Cerne Abbas, Dorset, and took an active part in local affairs until the onset of his final illness, which dragged on for several years. He died of cancer at his home, Billeys House, 16 Long Street, Cerne Abbas, Dorchester, Dorset, on 18 October 1992. He was survived by his wife and their three children. A memorial service was held at St Paul's Cathedral on 8 December 1992.<br>
