<span class="headword">Henderson,  George</span>  (1866&#150;1912), <span class="occ">Gaelic scholar</span>, was born on 18 February 1866 at Heughden, Kiltarlity, Inverness-shire, the son of Elizabeth Fraser, daughter of a farmer; his reputed father was George Henderson, general merchant, of Inverness  (d. cert.); he had a half-sister, Wilhelmina Fraser. He was educated at Raining's School, Inverness, under Dr Alexander Bain, the Gaelic lexicographer, whose <span class="italic">Outlines of Gaelic Etymology</span> Henderson was to edit in 1909, and at Edinburgh University, where he studied the arts curriculum in English literature, philosophy, and Celtic, the last under Professor Donald MacKinnon. He graduated in 1888. He was awarded the MacPherson scholarship in Celtic, and became examiner for the Celtic MA.<br>
<br>In 1892 Henderson spent some time in South Uist and made an important collection of oral Gaelic literature there, still mostly unpublished. He formed a friendship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49681/', "Father Allan McDonald")</script>, then parish priest at Daliburgh. Early in 1893 he went on a Dickson travelling scholarship to Vienna, where he acquired a PhD degree, and may have studied Old Irish under Julius Pokorny, who wrote articles on the subject for the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span>. In 1893&#150;6 Henderson collected and edited, with a memoir, John Morison's <span class="italic">Dain Iain Ghobha</span>, two volumes of religious verse very popular and influential in Gaelic circles. He returned from abroad in 1896 and went to Jesus College, Oxford, obtaining a BLitt degree for his work on Scottish Gaelic dialects, later published in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Celtische Philologie</span>, volumes 4 and 5.<br>
<br>From 1892 to 1900 Henderson corresponded with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48849/', "Alexander Carmichael")</script> over corrections and suggestions in <span class="italic">Carmina Gadelica</span> (1900), becoming a friend of Carmichael and his family. It is said that the Carmichaels had hoped that Henderson would marry their daughter Ella, and it came as a shock to them to hear that he had suddenly married a lady called Agnes Neighbour (on her marriage certificate) or Agnes D. Niebuhr (in Henderson's later entry in Scott's <span class="italic">Fasti ecclesiae Scoticanae</span>); they married in the parish church at Iffley near Oxford on 30 May 1901. In June 1901 he went to Edinburgh for ordination as a Church of Scotland minister, and subsequently to the remote parish of Eddrachillis in north-west Sutherland as assistant and successor to the Revd Kenneth MacKenzie, the parish minister.<br>
<br>In 1906, however, Henderson accepted an offer of the Kelly MacCallum lectureship in Celtic at Glasgow University. Between 1901 and 1906 he came into the possession of the valuable collection of Gaelic folksongs and their tunes collected on the Isle of Skye by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55495/', "Frances Tolmie (1840&#150;1926)")</script>. In 1908 Henderson recommended publication of the collection by the Folksong Society, which was done in 1911; the delay allowed the appearance of the first volume of Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser's <span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> (1909), though Miss Tolmie had begun collecting as early as 1860. Henderson added notes to Tolmie's volume.<br>
<br>Henderson's output of published material was large, but at times erratic and inconsistent; his erudition seemed to get out of control. One of his most important works was an edition of <span class="italic">Fled Bricrend</span> (&#145;The feast of Bricriu&#146;), done for the Irish Texts Society as its second volume in 1899; a fourteen-page review in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Celtische Philologie</span>, 3 (1901), by J. Strachan was mostly devoted to correcting errors in the translation. Other works of importance were <span class="italic">Leabhar nan Gleann</span> (1898); his work on Gaelic dialects in <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Celtische Philologie</span>; and the Fionn Saga published in the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span> (vols. 1, 2, and 3), beginning with a general discussion of the subject and concluding with a good version taken down on Eriskay with some assistance from Father Allan McDonald and never completed (the final part is in one of McDonald's notebooks). This was followed by <span class="italic">The Norse Influence on Celtic Scotland</span> (1910), an important early discussion of this subject, and <span class="italic">Survivals in Belief among the Celts</span> (1911). He also published <span class="italic">Arthurian Motifs in Gadhelic Literature</span> (1912). By this time Henderson's health was failing, and he died from nephritis and uraemia on 26 June 1912 at 28 Viewpark Drive, Rutherglen. His wife died on 19 September 1937.<br>
