<span class="headword">Hall,  David</span>  (1683&#150;1756), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and Quaker minister</span>, was born on 22 December 1683 at Skipton in Craven, West Riding of Yorkshire, the fourth of the five children of John Hall (<i>c</i>.1637&#150;1719), tailor, innkeeper, and Quaker, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1644&#150;1725), daughter of Adam Payteffeild of Skipton. He was brought up within the dissenting network of first-generation Quakers who had experienced persecution. His own parents suffered during the 1680s. With easier times after 1689 his father organized the erection in 1693 of Skipton's Quaker meeting-house. Smallpox struck in the same year. Hall's two brothers had died in infancy; now his two sisters succumbed to the disease. He himself was incapacitated for five years, and to the end he &#145;could rarely walk steddily&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Collection of Testimonies</span>, 1760, 328&#150;31). Eventually he resumed at Ermysted's Grammar School, Skipton, and did well.<br>
<br>In 1703, excluded from university by his dissent and unfit for a manual trade, Hall set up a school in his parents' home, which until then had been an inn. It had twelve rooms, with stabling and a smallholding. Here, with the meeting-house near by, he ran a boarding-school for Quaker boys for the next fifty years. Such schools were in demand by Friends. The number of pupils varied from more than forty to fewer than a dozen, &#145;many Friends from different parts of the nation sending their children&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Collection of Testimonies</span>, 1760), including &#145;south-country boys&#146;  (Hall, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 11). The annual fee was &pound;8. The school's influence also spread through his young assistants or ushers, four of whom&#151;James Gough, Robert Proud, George Routh, and Abraham Shackleton&#151;became noted Quaker schoolmasters elsewhere. On 24 February 1717 Hall married Mary Storrs (1686&#150;1717), a Quaker from Todmorden; she died during pregnancy on 10 October of that year. His second wife was Ann Foster (<i>bap</i>. 1698, <i>d</i>. 1736), a Quaker from Rylstone, near Skipton, whom he married on 17 November 1725; the couple had nine children, three of whom reached adulthood.<br>
<br>Hall's vocal ministry in meetings was welcomed as plain and simple. He had a talent for using his intimate <span class="roman">Bible</span> knowledge, and from his early thirties he was a recognized minister. In 1736, retaining an apartment in the house, he put the school under the care of George and Elizabeth Routh. Soon after, on 8 July, Ann died. Hall had always travelled widely to Friends' meetings, and there now came five busy years of visiting, counselling, and speaking among Friends in Scotland, Ireland, and many parts of England. As was the custom he liked to be accompanied by a young Friend, maybe a former pupil, for whom it was a fine experience. He doubtless travelled on horseback; certainly his father had kept two riding horses. Other travelling Friends liked to call at the school and to attend the Skipton meeting. Such visits gave strength to the Society of Friends.<br>
<br>A bent for teasing spiced the social morality in Hall's school rules. He wrote playful doggerel celebrating a Quaker anniversary at Preston and a whimsical letter recalling his visit to the London yearly meeting. In a pencil-drawn caricature of Hall a severe mouth is balanced by twinkling eyes.<br>
<br>Hall's published works, written between 1738 and 1753, reveal his perception of the current state of the society. His life bridged what he saw as its inspired simplicity under persecution to its easier times when he felt Friends' conduct often fell short. So his messages spoke of their lifestyle, discussing standards of conduct for their varied roles of parent, employer, trader, servant, and child, and exploring the problems of disownment from membership, mere nominal membership, and marrying out or mixed marriage. Memoirs by him of his own and his father's lives, with most of his printed writings, were published in one volume in 1758, with a second edition in 1799.<br>
<br>After the death of his second wife, Hall married again on 5 November 1740; his third wife was Deborah Atkinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Story (1705&#150;1767), a Quaker originally coming from Preston Patrick, near Kendal, and the widow of Thomas Atkinson. Hall died at Skipton on 16 September 1756 and his body was interred in the burial-ground adjoining Skipton meeting-house. He was survived by his wife, who now returned to Kendal, where she remained until her death.<br>
