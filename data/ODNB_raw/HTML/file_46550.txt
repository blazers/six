<span class="headword">Thomas, Sir  Daniel Lleufer</span>  (1863&#150;1940), <span class="occ">stipendiary magistrate</span>, was born Daniel Thomas at Llethr Enoch, Cwm-du, Llandeilo Fawr, Carmarthenshire, on 29 August 1863, the second son and third child of William Thomas, a tenant farmer, and his wife Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans. He attended the preparatory school at Llansawel run by the Congregational minister Jonah Evans, and worked for a time on his father's farm. Aged seventeen he entered Llandovery College, where the headmaster, A. G. Edwards, encouraged him to study at Oxford University, which he entered as a non-collegiate student in 1883, having adopted the additional name Lleufer. In May 1886 he was among the seven founders, including Owen M. Edwards and John Morris-Jones, of the Dafydd ap Gwilym Society of Welsh-speaking undergraduates. He read jurisprudence at Oxford, taking third-class honours in 1887, and gained a Tancred studentship at Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the bar in 1889. In London he was involved with Tom Ellis in establishing the Cymru Fydd society in support of Welsh self-government. On 18 June 1892 he married Mary Jane Margaret Gethin or Gething (<i>b</i>. 1862), daughter of Thomas Gething, mechanical engineer, of the Aber-nant ironworks, Aberd&acirc;r. They had no surviving children, but adopted a daughter.<br>
<br>In March 1892 Lleufer Thomas was appointed an assistant commissioner to the royal commission on labour, and undertook detailed enquiries into the working conditions of agricultural labourers in seven poor-law unions in north and south Wales. His report represents a major survey of rural life in late nineteenth-century Wales. He retired from the commission in April 1893 to take up the position of secretary to the royal commission on land in Wales and Monmouthshire, appointed by Gladstone's Liberal government to investigate the grievances of Welsh tenant farmers during the agricultural depression. The commissioners toured Wales hearing testimony from farmers (including Lleufer Thomas's elder brother, John), landlords, and a few labourers, accumulating five volumes of evidence, representing the contending positions, including the nonconformist tenants' complaints of discrimination at the hands of Anglican landlords. He suffered a breakdown during the commission's proceedings, and recuperated in South Africa, from where he returned to draft the commission's majority report, which recommended concession of the tenants' principal demands for security of tenure, compensation for improvements, and land courts to fix rents. By the time of the report's publication, in 1896, a Unionist government was in power, and the commission's proposals had no chance of being implemented. The evidence, with important bibliographical, legal, and historical appendices compiled by Lleufer Thomas, remained as a quarry of data.<br>
<br>During the decade of Unionist political dominance from 1895 to 1905 Lleufer Thomas's opportunities for public employment were reduced, and he returned to legal practice. His wider activities turned to promoting Welsh cultural and higher-education institutions, and to promoting progressive ideas of co-partnership and social service. He was a founding member of the National Library of Wales and the National Museum, and in 1905 was influential in the decision to site the library at Aberystwyth, in securing funding from the south Wales miners, and in obtaining for the library the right to receive books under the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span>. He was a member of the court of the University of Wales, where he was involved in establishing legal education, and sat on the councils of the university colleges of Cardiff and Aberystwyth. From 1906 he was vice-president of the Labour Co-partnership Association, which favoured co-partnership as a solution to labour conflict, and as a means of tackling the problems of urban housing. He helped establish the Cardiff Workers' Co-operative Garden Village Society, which built the Rhiwbina suburb in Cardiff. In 1907 he held a watching brief for the Welsh Nonconformist Central Evidence Committee during the hearings of the royal commission on the church in Wales.<br>
<br>In 1909 Lleufer Thomas was appointed stipendiary magistrate for the Rhondda and Pontypridd, where his own measured handling of the Tonypandy riots in November 1910 earned the approval of General Nevil Macready, if not local property owners. He witnessed at first hand the deteriorating industrial relations of the south Wales coalfield, and in 1917 was appointed chairman of the Welsh panel of the commission of inquiry into industrial unrest, whose other members were Thomas Evans and Vernon Hartshorn. His appointment was an acknowledgement of his bipartisan standing, and was also shrewd politics on the part of Lloyd George. The report, signed in July 1917, recommended the creation of Whitley councils to reduce industrial conflict. From 1915 to 1919 he was chairman of the School of Social Service for Wales, and during the same period was president of the Workers' Educational Association in Wales. He collaborated with the sociologist Edgar Chappell, who had been secretary to the industrial unrest inquiry, in founding the Welsh Housing and Development Association, which urged government grants for working-class housing as an element of post-war reconstruction.<br>
<br>Lleufer Thomas's increasing preoccupation with social and industrial conditions reflected a concern that industrial and political unrest within the coalfield had undermined the cultural and &#145;national&#146; values that had underpinned the success and stability of the Welsh liberal order. Few were better placed or connected to the social and cultural milieu of early twentieth-century Wales. Much of his social work was concerned with inculcating an &#145;enlightened&#146; and &#145;responsible&#146; social leadership within increasingly heterogeneous and democratizing societies that were believed to be cut off from traditional national sources of authority and leadership. As deputy chancellor of the University of Wales from 1915 to 1917 he argued that university extramural tutorial classes and Workers' Educational Association classes should provide the education and breadth of outlook that were thought lacking in the coalfields, to counter the &#145;sectionalism&#146; and militancy of the South Wales Miners' Federation's labour classes. Housing reform and town planning were to provide the sense of community and rationality required in the Welsh coalfields. His writings on this subject melded early sociological thought, the ideas of Ebenezer Howard and Patrick Geddes, and the social geography of H. J. Fleure, professor of geography and anthropology at Aberystwyth, to provide a distinctive analysis of the housing problem and its solution in south Wales. He argued the need for a regional strategy for the planned urban development of garden cities beyond the restrictive and intellectually confining coalfield valleys of Glamorgan, and even on the flatter mountain tops.<br>
<br>Lleufer Thomas was close to several miners' leaders of the old school, such as William Brace and Thomas Richards, some of whom were active within the Labour Co-partnership Association and organizations like the Welsh Housing Development Association. Through these and other connections he was more aware than many of his contemporaries of the realities and concerns of organized labour. He shared aspects of the miners' criticism of the &#145;slash and burn&#146; capitalism of the majority of the coalowners in the post-war years, favouring some form of state ownership of the mining industry with workers' involvement in management. Yet in his official capacity as a magistrate he was equally concerned to restrict the activities of militants during the 1921 coal dispute. He worked with Lionel Lindsay, chief constable of the Glamorgan constabulary, and his interpretation of the law severely limited the right to picket. A. J. Cook, Rhondda miner's agent, and several other militant leaders, were imprisoned in 1921 for intimidation when trying to picket the collieries.<br>
<br>Lleufer Thomas was a member of the Board of Celtic Studies of the University of Wales from its foundation in 1919. The university awarded him the honorary degree of LLD in 1921. In 1925 he was a member of the department of education's committee on the position of Welsh language and literature in Welsh schools. He was vice-president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association and of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion. He was a contributor of articles on Welsh subjects to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and to the eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1910&#150;11).<br>
<br>In 1931 Lleufer Thomas was knighted for his public services. After a period of illness and an accident in 1932 he retired as a stipendiary magistrate in 1933. He died at home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff, on 8 August 1940, and was buried at Oystermouth cemetery, near Swansea. His wife and their adopted daughter survived him. Like his contemporary David Lloyd George, he was a beneficiary of social mobility in the late Victorian period, and became a key figure in the development of Welsh public life.<br>
