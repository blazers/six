<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Curran, Sir  Charles John</span>  (1921&#150;1980), <span class="occ">broadcasting administrator</span>, was born in Dublin on 13 October 1921, the only son and eldest of the four children of Felix Curran, an army schoolmaster, and his wife, Alicia Isabella Bruce, from Aberdeen. Curran referred later to his &#145;Irish birth without an Irish upbringing&#146;, because after three weeks he left Dublin for Aberdeen, his mother's native home. He had no Scots upbringing either, since in 1924 his family moved to the West Riding of Yorkshire, where he studied at the local elementary school and at Wath-on-Dearne grammar school before entering Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1939. He obtained a first class in part 1 of the history tripos in 1941.<br>
<br>Familiar with army ways, Curran served in the Indian army in India, Cyprus, and Italy from 1941 to 1945 before completing his degree in history in 1946 with a first class in part 2 and joining the British Broadcasting Corporation as a talks producer in 1947. In 1949 he married Silvia, daughter of John Meyer, restaurateur. They had one daughter. After only three years with the BBC Curran left the corporation and the country to become for one year assistant director (1950&#150;51) of the Canadian commercial journal <span class="italic">Fishing News</span>. His father's mother had been born in Nova Scotia, and he himself retained an active interest in Canada. He had also shown a gift for learning languages, first in India, and when in August 1951 he returned to the BBC it was to join its monitoring service at Caversham as a report writer.<br>
<br>In September 1953 Curran became the BBC's first internally selected administrative trainee, visiting or working for a time in different departments of the BBC in and out of London and assisting in the preparation of the BBC's first personnel manual. His subsequent progress inside the corporation was rapid and distinctive&#151;from the external services in Bush House to Canada again, this time as BBC representative from 1956 to 1959; back to Bush House as head of external broadcasting administration; on to Broadcasting House as the BBC's secretary (1963&#150;6), a post of varying status and influence at different times in the history of the BBC, but during the regime of the director-general Sir Hugh Greene, who had personally selected Curran for the job, a key post drawing him into discussions of policy, often highly controversial policy, as well as of administration; back again to Bush House as director of external services (1967&#150;9), which brought him into close touch with government; and on Greene's retirement becoming, to his considerable surprise, director-general himself in April 1969. He was knighted in 1974 and had honorary degrees from the City University (DLitt, 1977) and the Open University (DUniv, 1978).<br>
<br>In his autobiographical study, <span class="italic">The Seamless Robe</span>, Curran's only book, published in 1979, he made much of the complementarity and underlying unity of his experiences before 1969. The title (and contents) reflected even more strongly, however, his deep, but never flaunted, religious conviction. He was the first Roman Catholic director-general of the BBC, taking over at a difficult time, when the Ulster issue was posing serious dilemmas for broadcasters as well as for politicians. His religion did not prove a handicap, although his scrupulous conscience never made life easy for him, and his philosophy of broadcasting, set out neatly in thoughtful lectures, was very different from that of Greene or of Baron Hill of Luton, his first chairman. Curran, never immune from criticism, thought of himself as &#145;a broadcasting manager&#146;. Yet he was not content with management. He insisted on quality of output, stressing its dependence not on committees but on individual producers operating in freedom.<br>
<br>Under Curran's regime the BBC survived intact as an institution, although the Annan committee on broadcasting, which reported in 1977, the year of Curran's departure from the BBC, revealed most of the stresses, financial as well as political and social, which Curran had experienced personally but had never been able to eliminate institutionally. He remained until 1978 president of the European Broadcasting Union, a post to which he had been elected in 1973 and which he greatly treasured. He was also from 1978 managing director of the television news agency Visnews. Curran died on 9 January 1980 at Barnet General Hospital following a heart attack.<br>
