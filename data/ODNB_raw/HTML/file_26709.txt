<span class="headword">Stuart,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third and youngest son among the seven children of Archibald Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1767) of Torrance, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Andrew Myreton, baronet, of Gogar. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26693/', "Andrew Stuart (1725&#150;1801)")</script>, lawyer, was an elder brother. James Stuart was first in the Dutch service, where he reached the rank of captain. He became lieutenant in the 58th regiment of the British army on 5 May 1756, and first saw active service in 1758 at the siege of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia, under Lord Amherst. On 20 October of the same year he was promoted captain in the 83rd regiment, and major on 7 December 1759. In 1761 he was present with Colonel Morgan's regiment at the reduction of Belle &Icirc;le. During the course of that expedition he acted as quartermaster-general, and in consequence obtained the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel. From Belle &Icirc;le Stuart went to the West Indies, where he served in the operations against Martinique and on the death of Colonel Morgan took command of the regiment. After the conquest of Martinique (February 1762) his regiment was ordered to join the expedition against Havana, where Stuart greatly distinguished himself by his conduct in the assault on the castle of Morro, the capture of which determined the success of the expedition. He returned home, and on 20 September 1763 married Lady Margaret, daughter of Hugh Hume, third earl of Marchmont, and his wife, Anne Western. They had no children before her early death on 7 January 1765.<br>
<br>In 1775 Stuart received permission to enter the service of the East India Company as second in command on the Coromandel coast, with the rank of colonel. On his arrival he found serious differences existing between the council of the Madras presidency and the governor, Lord Pigot. Stuart followed the orders of the council in trying to restore the raja of Tanjore to lands dubiously transferred to the nawab of Arcot, whose debts were the main cause of the trouble. The affair degenerated into confusion, in the course of which Stuart arrested Pigot on 23 August 1776 and allowed the dissident councillors to assume power in Madras. After news of the arrest reached Britain, Pigot was reinstated but immediately recalled, while Stuart was suspended by the company directors from the office of commander-in-chief to which he had succeeded with the rank of brigadier-general in December 1776. Although he repeatedly demanded a trial, he could not, despite peremptory orders from Britain, succeed in obtaining a court martial until December 1780, when he was honourably acquitted and by order of the directors received the arrears of his pay from the time of his suspension. On 11 January 1781 he was restored to the chief command in Madras by order of the governor and council. He returned to Madras in that year and, under Sir Eyre Coote, on 1 July took part in the battle of Porto Novo, in which he distinguished himself by his able handling of the second line of the British force. In the battle of Polillur, on 27 August, he lost a leg to a cannon shot. He was promoted major-general on 19 October, and on the return of Sir Eyre Coote to Bengal in January 1782 took command of the forces in Madras. The governor, Lord Macartney, however, would not allow him the freedom of action which Eyre Coote had enjoyed, and on the death of Haidar Ali on 7 December 1782 urged Stuart immediately to attack the Mysore army. Stuart declared his forces were not ready, and made no active movement for two months. While besieging Cuddalore he was suspended from the command by the Madras government, was placed in strict confinement in Madras, and then sent back to Britain. Resenting &#145;his Lordship's personal conduct to him&#146;, Stuart called out Lord Macartney, and on 8 June 1786 they fought a duel in Hyde Park. Owing to the loss of his leg, Stuart was &#145;under the necessity from the first of putting his back to a tree&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 523), but succeeded in severely wounding his opponent. Unsatisfied by the outcome, both participants threatened to resume the duel, until the king indicated his wish that the matter be taken no further. On 8 February 1792 Stuart was appointed colonel of the 31st foot. He died a year later, on 2 February 1793.<br>
