<span class="headword">Ashburnham,  John</span>  (1602/3&#150;1671), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Ashburnham (1570/71&#150;1620) and Elizabeth (1577&#150;1651), daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/739/', "William Ashburnham")</script>, army officer and politician, was his younger brother. He was educated at Gray's Inn and Peterhouse, Cambridge. His father died in 1620, having wasted his estate and leaving his family in penury. But within two years his heir had so far repaired their broken fortune, that (says the epitaph in Ashburnham church, Sussex) &#145;there were none of them but were in a condition rather to be helpful to others than to want support themselves&#146;  (Horsfield, 1.559).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Beaumont was of the same family as Lady Villiers, mother of the duke of Buckingham, and under Buckingham's patronage began the court career of John Ashburnham. In 1627 he was already known to the king, who styled him &#145;Jack Ashburnham&#146; in his letters to the duke. In 1628 he was elected MP for Hastings, speaking in defence of his patron when that parliament attempted the duke's impeachment. The murder of Buckingham in that year did not injure Ashburnham's fortunes; he was in November sworn in as groom of the bedchamber, although there is no evidence that he served in that capacity for any length of time. The calendars of state papers contain ample evidence that he and his friend, the secretary Nicholas, omitted few of the many opportunities given them by their position at court to enrich themselves by money-lending or by the purchase of land at easy rates. In 1638 the Star Chamber fine of 2000 marks, inflicted on Sir Walter Long and his brother, was assigned to Ashburnham &#145;in satisfaction of so much due from his majesty to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and in December of the next year a warrant under the privy seal enabled him to regain his ancestral estate of Ashburnham, which had become a ruinous burden to its actual possessors. If the dates assigned in the printed calendars are correct, Ashburnham had not obtained the favour of this warrant until six years after his petition for it. His friends Nicholas and Goring were &#145;very careful of his interest&#146; (as he himself acknowledges), in promoting his appointment as &#145;provider&#146; to the army then in preparation for Scotland  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 510). Their success prevented his election for Hastings when the Commons were summoned in April 1640 only to be dissolved in May; but he was returned for that place on the interest of Lord Lumley in November, when the failure of the war, the necessities of the king, and the exasperation of the people had rendered inevitable the meeting of another&#151;the Long&#151;parliament. No speech of his is recorded, but his name frequently occurs as on committees, or as a teller on divisions, during the earlier sessions of that assembly. As time went on his two functions of member of parliament and servant of the king became incompatible, and when his attendance on his master prevented his obeying the summons of the house he was proceeded against for contempt (6 May 1642). The king wrote a letter to the Commons in his justification, but the house maintained its prior right to the obedience of its member. Ashburnham was &#145;discharged and disabled&#146; (5 February 1644), and his estate was sequestrated (14 September). His wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1651), daughter of William Holland of West Burton, Sussex, whom he married by licence of 24 September 1629, petitioned unsuccessfully for some allowance for their four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Retaining the favour of Charles I, Ashburnham became the treasurer and paymaster of the king's army. For the next three years his name occurs in several negotiations for peace. He was one of the commissioners at Uxbridge (1644), and one of the four appointed to lay the king's proposals before parliament (December 1645). When Fairfax prepared to besiege Oxford, and Charles determined upon flight, Ashburnham and Michael Hudson were the sole attendants of the king in his perilous journey to the Scottish camp. Hudson was released, and Ashburnham was positively commanded by the king to fly before confirmation of the order to send him up to London as a delinquent could be received. He made his way safely to the Netherlands and thence to the queen at Paris, where he joined the chorus urging the king to drop his opposition to the covenant and make himself a &#145;King of Presbytery&#146;  (Wedgwood, 552). In 1647 the king's fortune seemed upon the turn. The army had taken possession of him at Holmby, had treated him with respect, and allowed him &#145;to have what servants about him he pleased&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Ashburnham resumed his attendance on his master at Hampton Court. But the army leaders changed their tone. Charles was haunted by the dread of assassination. He was constantly receiving warnings, anonymous and avowed, that his murder was resolved upon. At Ashburnham's suggestion he made proposals to the Scottish commissioners for his sudden journey to London and personal treaty with the parliament. But the arrangement fell through, the commissioners dreading the responsibility. Charles, resolved to stay no longer in Hampton Court and impatient to be gone, commanded Ashburnham and his other confidants, Sir John Berkeley and Legge, to propose some place for him to go to. Ashburnham mentioned Sir John Oglander's house in the Isle of Wight as a place where the king might be concealed until the disposition of the governor of the island, Colonel Robert Hammond, could be ascertained. If Hammond were not to be trusted, the fugitive could secretly take ship for France. There was nothing impracticable in the plan, but its success depended upon keeping the royal whereabouts from the knowledge of Hammond until the governor had fully engaged himself to respect the king's liberty of action. This particular was neglected, and the secret divulged by Berkeley. The governor, having given assurances of loyalty, was taken to the house wherein Charles was awaiting the result of the interview. When informed of his approach, the king exclaimed, &#145;O Jack, thou hast undone me!&#146; The foreboding was true. Refusing the desperate offer of Ashburnham to make all safe by killing Hammond, Charles again became virtually a prisoner.<br>
<br>Ashburnham's share in the transaction to relocate the king exposed him to the suspicions of the royalists, and his explanation, printed in 1648, was of necessity so guarded as to be ineffective. A full narrative drawn up by him and shown to many of his contemporaries&#151;Clarendon among the rest&#151;remained unpublished until 1830, when his descendant, Lord Ashburnham, printed it with full elucidation and a complete, caustic commentary on all the passages in which Clarendon mentioned the writer. The reputation of Ashburnham is repaired, if not entirely cleared, and the splenetic bias of Clarendon is exposed with unsparing severity.<br>
<br>Ashburnham was parted from the king by order of parliament on 1 January 1648, was imprisoned in Windsor Castle (May), and when the second civil war broke out was exchanged for Sir William Masham. He was not allowed to attend Charles during the treaty at Newport (August), and was included among the delinquents who were to expect no pardon (13 October). His position after the king's death was unenviable. The royalists suspected his fidelity, and in March 1650 a memorial to Charles II asked whether Ashburnham was to be trusted. He acquired an estate by his second marriage, about 1651, to the Dowager Lady Poulett and the king gave him permission to stay in England to preserve it. However, Ashburnham found himself harassed by the new republican regime. He was sued for debts contracted for the late king and was forced to compound for one half of his estate, an unparalleled severity. He was bound in heavy securities to appear, when required, before the council of state. His private journeys were licensed by a pass from the same authority. For three years he was so persecuted by committees to discover who had lent the king money during the wars that &#145;I had scarce time to eat my bread&#146;. &#145;Five years more&#146;, he continues, &#145;were spent in close imprisonment at London, and three banishments to Guernsey Castle, the cause being for sending money to his majesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In a list of the Tower prisoners furnished by Colonel Barkstead (2 June 1654) Ashburnham appears as prisoner for high treason, as both John and his younger brother, William Ashburnham, were taken into custody for their suspected complicity in the plot of Gerard and Vowel. John's case was (27 December 1655) referred to the major-generals of the counties where his estate lay.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Ashburnham came back to his old place of groom of the bedchamber. Of the Hampton Court business, Pepys notes that having &#145;all solemnly charged one another with their failures therein, and &hellip; been at daggers-drawing publicly about it&#146;, Ashburnham, Berkeley, and Legge were &#145;now none greater friends in the world&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.317). Besides his place Ashburnham received what acknowledgement of his loyalty the royal Treasury, impoverished by many claimants, could afford. In September 1661 he was the head of a commission to inquire into the abuses in the Post Office. His house at Chiswick, with its contents, was purchased by the king for the duke of Monmouth, of whom in January 1665 he was made one of the guardians. Ashburnham's loans to Charles I were paid by grants of crown leases, but his schemes for the acquisition of land do not appear to have run so smoothly as in the former reign. The dean and chapter of Exeter were menaced (November 1662) with the royal displeasure should they carry out their projected lease &#145;to John Ashburnham or to any other&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was MP for Sussex from 1661 until his expulsion in 1667 for taking a bribe of &pound;500 from French merchants. &#145;An active member&#146;, he appears generally to have supported &#145;Cavalier&#146; policies, and remained loyal to the court interest even when denied appointment to the office of keeper of the privy purse  (Crook, 552). He and his brother, William, shared in an enterprise for reviving the manufacture of tapestry at Mortlake in 1671. The principal source of his wealth was the wealden iron works on which his family's fortunes were originally built. He died on 15 June 1671, aged sixty-eight, and was buried in the family vault at Ashburnham. His grandson was raised to the peerage in 1689.<br>
