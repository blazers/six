<span class="headword">Potter,  Thomas Rossell</span>  (1799&#150;1873), <span class="occ">antiquary and journalist</span>, son of John Potter (<i>c</i>.1773&#150;1827), a farmer, of West Hallam, Derbyshire, and his wife, Mary Rossell (<i>c</i>.1772&#150;1840), was born at West Hallam on 7 January 1799. He was educated at the grammar schools at Risley and Wirksworth. When he was fifteen his parents moved to Wymeswold in Leicestershire, where Potter lived for the rest of his life. He married, on 14 January 1836, Frances Sarah (1807&#150;1896), daughter of Leonard Fosbrooke of Shardlow Hall, Derbyshire, and Ravenstone Hall, Leicestershire. They had five sons and four daughters; two of their children died in infancy.<br>
<br>Potter's intention of taking holy orders was frustrated by his father's death in 1827. Instead, he started a school at Wymeswold, which proved successful, and, with the exception of a few years devoted entirely to literary work, he spent the remainder of his days as a schoolmaster and a newspaper editor. From his schooldays he had developed literary tastes and was much interested in antiquities and geology. In 1842, owing to an outbreak of fever, he temporarily moved his school from Wymeswold to a house in Charnwood Forest. While living here he collected notes on the history, antiquities, natural history, and geology of that district for his book <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest</span> (1842). This, his largest work, shows considerable depth of research. Encouraged by its reception, Potter planned a new edition of John Nichols's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Leicestershire</span> (1790), revised and brought up to date, but his effort proved abortive; only <span class="italic">The Physical Geography and Geology of Leicestershire</span> (1866), written by D. T. Ansted as part of the project, was ever published.<br>
<br>Potter was fond of field sports and regularly rode with the Quorn hunt. He contributed papers and poems to the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> from 1827 until 1840, under the pseudonym of Old Grey. Afterwards he wrote for the <span class="italic">Sporting Review</span>. One of the best of his sporting pieces was a poem entitled &#145;The Meltonians&#146; (1835). Potter was also editor of the <span class="italic">Leicester Advertiser</span> from 1849, of the <span class="italic">Ilkeston Pioneer</span> from 1856, and of the <span class="italic">Leicester Guardian</span> from 1858. In 1865 he was editor of the <span class="italic">Loughborough Monitor</span>, which, on amalgamation with another paper, became the <span class="italic">Loughborough Monitor and News</span>. Some lyrical ballads by Potter, in which local legends were incorporated, were collected in a volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> after his death by his son Charles Neville Potter in 1881. His other works included <span class="italic">Walks Round Loughborough</span> (1840), <span class="italic">The Genius of Nottinghamshire</span> (1849), and <span class="italic">Rambles Round Loughborough</span>, reprinted from the <span class="italic">Loughborough News</span> (1868).<br>
<br>Potter died on 19 April 1873, at The Hermitage, Wymeswold, and was buried in Wymeswold on 23 April.<br>
