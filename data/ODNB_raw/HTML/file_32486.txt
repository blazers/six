</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cole,  George Douglas Howard</span>  (1889&#150;1959), <span class="occ">university teacher and political theorist</span>, was born in Cambridge on 25 September 1889, the son of George Cole, a jeweller who later moved to Ealing in west London and became a surveyor, and his wife, Jessie Knowles. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, and Balliol College, Oxford (1908&#150;12), where he studied classical history and philosophy. As a student Cole became heavily involved in political and literary activities, joining both the Fabian Society and the Independent Labour Party, contributing to the Oxford <span class="italic">Blue Book</span>, agitating for the Workers' Educational Association, and editing the <span class="italic">Oxford Reformer</span>. Despite his tutors' concern, his education was unaffected by the extent of this political engagement. He completed his degree with firsts in both classical moderations (1910) and the final honour school of <i>literae humaniores</i> (1912) and was elected to a prize fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1912.<h2>
<a name="Guildsocialism"></a>Guild socialism</h2>On arriving at Magdalen, Cole abandoned the classics and began formally to study economics and political thought. In his initial research he endeavoured to construct a comparative account of the development of trade unionism across the western world. The result, <span class="italic">The World of Labour</span> (1913), published when he was still only twenty-four, received astonishing critical acclaim. Although a survey of existing trade unionism, <span class="italic">The World of Labour</span> also contained an uncompromising prescriptive message. He insisted that the tendency of the British left to expect that central governmental agencies would play the leading role in constructing a socialist future was essentially misplaced, in terms both of strategy and of principle. British socialists, Cole insisted, should abandon their obsession with parliamentary elections and look instead to the direct action of trade unions. Social, economic, and political improvement could realistically be attained only by a policy of &#145;encroaching control&#146;, whereby trade unions would use strike action to gain an increasing amount of direct responsibility for the conduct of industry. Similarly, he contended, British socialists should strive to create an ideal society that would not require an overbearing state but which would rather ensure that power was radically decentralized and invested in a series of loosely federated industrial and social groups to be known as guilds.<br>
<br>The decentralizing element of Cole's agenda was widely popular in the first fifteen years of the twentieth century and Cole was one of an exceptionally broad alliance of thinkers advancing it. The argument was particularly closely associated with the London-based weekly newspaper the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, which drew on the work of a series of iconoclastic literary, cultural, and political figures, including Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton, consistently to outperform and outsell its more renowned counterparts. On publication of <span class="italic">The World of Labour</span> Cole rapidly became one of the most prominent figures of the <span class="italic">New Age</span> set, publishing an extensive article almost every week and frequently setting the paper's political agenda. Despite the prestige the paper allowed him, however, he was never entirely satisfied with a publication that presented attacks on the state from anarchists, <i>laissez-faire</i> liberals, disgruntled churchmen, medieval revivalists, and arch-conservatives. Such breadth had its limitations even for someone ideologically committed to diversity. Cole thus quickly developed a longing for an organization within which to develop and propagate his own unique message.<br>
<br>For a period during 1913&#150;14, when he was living in Newcastle upon Tyne, Cole worked closely with the Social Democratic Federation, but the Fabian Society soon became the main focus of his efforts. Elected to the Fabian Society's executive committee in April 1914, he made an audacious attempt to take control of the society. Although he found a number of supporters among the younger members of the Fabian research department, his efforts to persuade the society at large to abandon their founding commitments and accept the guild ideal failed to attract widespread support. On learning of his defeat at the annual Fabian summer school at Keswick in June 1914, he heckled the speakers, organized a walkout, and then led a protest in the village square. His unruly behaviour was widely condemned, and few Fabians mourned his resignation from the society a year later.<br>
<br>Immediately after the failure of the Fabian take-over, Cole led a breakaway from the society, although he remained a member of the Fabian research department, and became its honorary secretary in 1916. Together with his fellow <span class="italic">New Age</span> contributors Ivor Brown, S. G. Hobson, William Mellor, and Maurice Reckitt, Cole formed an alternative political grouping, the National Guilds League (NGL). The NGL adopted its own constitution for the ideal society, known as the <span class="roman">Storrington Document</span> after the Sussex village in which it was written, and began to produce a series of journals, all of which were dedicated to shaping and propagating the anti-statist philosophy increasingly known as &#145;guild socialism&#146;. The NGL also worked tirelessly to forge connections between leading guild socialist intellectuals and the larger trade union movement, managing as it did so to secure Cole appointment in 1915 as an unpaid research officer at the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. Cole advised the union on how to respond to wartime legislation including the <span class="roman">Munitions Act</span>. Although the job was relatively undemanding, it none the less enabled him to escape conscription on the grounds that he was conducting work of &#145;national importance&#146;.<br>
<br>With exemption from military service secured, Cole spent the war years developing a fully fledged political theory of guild socialism. His work was shaped by a number of influences, including such ever-present socialist founding fathers as Robert Owen, William Morris, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (whose <span class="italic">Contrat Social</span> he translated in 1913), and John Ruskin. The most notable and unlikely source of inspiration, however, was the Anglican clergyman John Neville Figgis, the leading light in the English pluralist movement. Figgis had adopted the nineteenth-century idealist philosophy of Thomas Hill Green and transformed it into a plea for extensive decentralization of political, social, and economic power and especially for the effective independence of the church from governmental oversight. Figgis argued that the forms of communal attachment desired by Green could be developed only within small, localized units, and that the late nineteenth-century trend towards increasing the powers of the nation state ran counter to such requirements. In the early war years Cole used Figgis's arguments to attack the statist theories of the Fabian Society and other socialist groups, suggesting that a political system which guaranteed independence to trade unions and other voluntary organizations would realize a socialistic ideal of communal harmony more effectively than any efforts to impose communal attachments from above.<br>
<br>As the war progressed, however, Cole began to abandon this position and to replace it with a much more individualistic philosophy. By 1917 he had firmly rejected the communitarian assumptions which had underpinned Figgis's arguments. Instead he began to insist that socialists, English pluralists, and other reformers had failed to give enough emphasis to the uniqueness of each and every individual. It was &#145;of the essence&#146; of each human being, Cole argued, &#145;that he is individual and cannot be absorbed into anything else&#146;. The result was a political theory which emphasized the priority of individual liberty over all other commitments and which suggested that the only legitimate social, political, and economic obligations were those that the individual chose himself. Despite the far-reaching philosophical transformation, though, the political recommendations which this new theory generated remained very similar to his earlier ideas. The power of the state would have to be limited, if not abolished altogether, and a wide series of guilds should be established to govern each area of life independently. Cole also insisted that such associations should all be radically democratized to ensure that the rules which governed people's lives were subject to the influence of the people themselves. These views were expounded throughout Cole's most accomplished theoretical works, including <span class="italic">Chaos and Order in Industry</span>, <span class="italic">Guild Socialism Restated</span>, and <span class="italic">Social Theory</span>, all of which were published in 1920.<br>
<br>The zeal and skill with which Cole presented these arguments made him a popular figure on the left. The libertarian underpinnings of his guild socialist message also seemed particularly attractive to reformers still reeling from the authoritarianism of wartime government. Thus in the immediate post-war world even old Fabian adversaries began to respond to his demands. Sidney and Beatrice Webb incorporated a number of guild socialist ideas into their post-war masterpiece <span class="italic">A Constitution for the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain</span>, and even nominated Cole, although unsuccessfully, for membership of Lloyd George's royal commission on the coal industry in 1919. Cole's work also found a considerable following overseas. In the United States many progressive and socialist reformers believed that the guild message was the perfect riposte to the centralizing powers adopted by Woodrow Wilson's wartime administration, and a few enthusiasts even opened a bookshop in New York's Greenwich Village dedicated to the guild socialist project.<br>
<br>Beyond the esteem of intellectuals, there was also a brief moment soon after the war when Cole had reason to believe that concrete political success was beckoning. Many British trade unionists, including Robert Smillie and Frank Hodges of the Miners' Federation, and some leading political figures, including Arthur Henderson, lent the guild socialist movement their explicit support. Cole, who had become the first honorary secretary for research in the Labour Research Department (successor to the Fabian research department), was appointed to represent the Labour interest alongside Henderson at the National Industrial Conference in 1919. The NGL even supported efforts to form guilds for piano workers and clerical officers, and to many people's surprise a short-lived guild was actually established in the building industry. Respected political and economic commentators, from both Britain and abroad, such as the <span class="italic">New Republic</span>'s Arthur Gleason urged &#145;industrial leaders&#146; to &#145;study guild socialism&#146; for &#145;soon they will be forced to accept it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Survey</span>, 19 May 1917, 159).<br>
<br>Despite the excitement, however, efforts to build a long-lasting political movement failed. As the parliamentary prospects of the British Labour Party rapidly improved after the adoption of a new party constitution in 1918, the newly elected Labour &eacute;lite became unwilling to risk the public suspicion that many feared would accompany association with radical movements such as the guild socialists. Nor did many trade unionists remain committed beyond the early 1920s. The sharp rise in unemployment in 1921 combined with the failure of many trade union activities leading to the collapse of the general strike in 1926 rendered most unions either too weak or too preoccupied to direct their energies in the direction of &#145;encroaching control&#146;. As the guild socialists' political strategy faltered, so too did the apparatus of intellectual support. Although the quality of much of the argument and analysis in the journals Cole edited was high, incorporating contributions from the likes of Bertrand Russell and R. H. Tawney, most of the long list of guild periodicals, including the NGL's <span class="italic">The Guildsman</span> and <span class="italic">Guild Socialist</span>, had collapsed by 1922. All efforts at resurrecting them failed. The last guild journal, <span class="italic">New Standards</span>, ceased publication in 1924.<h2>
<a name="Universityteacher"></a>University teacher</h2>Dismayed by the failure of the guild socialist movement, Cole began in 1924 to reassess both his career and his fundamental theoretical and political commitments. After much deliberation he applied for the newly established position of reader in economics at the University of Oxford, and was appointed in 1925, resigning his position at the Labour Research Department. He also took up a teaching fellowship in University College, Oxford, to supplement his university lecturing duties. He initially found the intensive Oxford tutorial system exceptionally onerous and, although he completed a biography of Robert Owen in 1925, he produced no major theoretical or political works during his first three years as reader.<br>
<br>Early in 1929, however, Cole finally published a new substantial monograph, <span class="italic">The Next Ten Years in British Social and Economic Policy</span>, which was intended to produce both ideological principles and concrete guidelines for an incoming Labour government. Cole used this opportunity formally to retract many of his guild socialist commitments, including his dedication to the democratization of industrial associations, which had been at the heart of his earlier political vision. Such ideas, Cole now announced, were the result not of serious research into the demands and requirements of the working population but rather the na&iuml;ve products of a &#145;politically minded person's utopia&#146;. In their place, he outlined plans which bore more than a passing resemblance to the authoritarian, bureaucratic socialism against which he had previously railed, including an acceptance of planning and of nationalization. He even called for a national labour corps to offer unemployed workmen a place in a &#145;disciplined force&#146; which would be directed by appointed government officials who would have &#145;the full power, subject to reasonable provision of appeal, of dismissing any member of it who fails to do satisfactory work&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Next Ten Years</span>, 52). It was a far cry from the individualistic, worker-centred programme of the guild age. Although the book was not a great success, Cole was welcomed back into the Fabian Society in 1929, and was rewarded a year later with a place alongside John Maynard Keynes in Ramsay MacDonald's Economic Advisory Council, established at the beginning of the second Labour government.<br>
<br>The reconciliation did not survive the collapse of MacDonald's government in 1931, after deep splits in the parliamentary Labour Party over the unemployment crisis, and Cole drifted back to the left of the party. In the next ten years he worked hard once again to produce a radically socialist alternative to mainstream labourism. He was convinced that the government's lack of clear principle had been the fundamental cause of its failure. Cole thus became a leading light in a variety of organizations designed to prompt a radical renewal in Labour thinking, including the Society for Socialist Inquiry and Propaganda (SSIP), founded in 1930, the New Fabian Research Bureau (1931), and the Socialist League (1932). As tensions in Europe increased, Cole also made sustained efforts to construct a British popular front against fascism, identifying the nature of the military threat long before many of his colleagues had abandoned their pacifism, and lending strong support to the republican cause in Spain.<br>
<br>Despite these radicalizing ambitions, though, Cole did not lose touch with more moderate influences in the labour movement; indeed in these years he developed a reputation for tolerance of the diverse forces operating in British left-wing politics. On accepting his readership in Oxford in 1925, he had formed an informal discussion circle known as the &#145;Cole group&#146;, which flourished throughout the 1930s and acted paradoxically as a seedbed for a more revisionist agenda for the party. In addition, he also concentrated throughout the 1930s on writing books about themes of general interest which he hoped would reach a broader audience than either academic texts or socialist polemics. His huge <span class="italic">History of Socialist Thought</span> was predated by <span class="italic">The Intelligent Man's Review of Europe Today</span> (1933), <span class="italic">The Condition of Britain</span> (1937) written with his wife, Margaret Cole, and, most notably of all, <span class="italic">The Common People</span> (1938), written with his brother-in-law Raymond William Postgate. All were outstanding successes. For several decades they remained classics in the emerging discipline of labour history, a field of study whose post-war prominence in British universities owed much to his inter-war endeavours.<br>
<br>In 1940 Cole returned to a position of political prominence when he was asked to assist Sir William Beveridge at the Ministry of Labour in drawing up a plan for the effective use of manpower during war. Early in 1941 he was appointed sub-warden of the newly founded Nuffield College, Oxford, and he combined these two roles in creating the Nuffield College Social Reconstruction Survey, which collated an enormous range of demographic, economic, and social data and employed it, much to government disapproval, to argue for an extensive programme of social reform. Cole's time at Nuffield was, though, cut short both by illness and by the government's withdrawal of funds for the survey. He resigned as sub-warden in September 1943, as director of the survey in January 1944, and as fellow in March. A few months later, however, he was appointed Chichele professor of social and political theory, and took up a fellowship at All Souls College. Claiming to be the only leading academic expert in all three branches of Oxford's final honour school of philosophy, politics, and economics, he continually encouraged the new college's fellowship to broaden their interests and maintain an interdisciplinary approach to a subject matter increasingly prone to narrow academic specialization. He also returned to discuss some of the central philosophical themes that he had touched upon in his youth, including the legitimacy of state power and the place of democratic mechanisms in modern industry.<br>
<br>During his years at All Souls, and in common with others of his generation, Cole actively returned also to the commitments of earlier days, developing a renewed scepticism of state authority. He accepted the need for economic planning and some form of central control but insisted once again that it &#145;must be based on a recognition of diversity&#146;. In trying to forward these ideas he stood unsuccessfully for one of the university's two parliamentary seats at the general election of 1945, his candidacy being endorsed by the university constituency Labour Party but not by the national party. He also refused to welcome the social policy reforms of the Attlee administration as warmly as might have been expected, demanding instead that the government take more seriously the need to involve welfare recipients, workers, and consumers directly in decision making at a local level.<h2>
<a name="Socialistintellectual"></a>Socialist intellectual</h2>Such continual changes of direction have led some critics to reject Cole as a permanent oppositionist, never able to settle on a conviction for more than a few years, especially if it was to become popular. Such a charge, however, overlooks both the merits of Cole's essential open-mindedness and the many aspects of his professional career which remained constant throughout his life. From his undergraduate days until his death Cole worked for the Workers' Educational Association and was celebrated widely as one of the association's finest tutors and administrators. Although not all the association's students appreciated his lecturing style&#151;one reported that Cole would uncontrollably stroll up and down the raised dais as he spoke, often appearing as if he was going to fall off the other side&#151;most praised his energy and his intellectual acumen, and many became active disciples. The association's administration certainly appreciated the continual efforts which he invested in the organization, stretching from his directorship of the association's early classes in London to long-term membership of its general purposes committee. Throughout the turmoil of the inter-war years Cole remained unstintingly committed to offering a broad-based, non-vocational, liberal education to those who had missed out on formal educational opportunities.<br>
<br>Cole also contributed to an enormous number of learned and popular periodicals throughout his long career, even at times of illness and personal distress. He found writing easy, was confident in his abilities, and rarely, if ever, agreed to alter his text on the basis of editorial advice or peer review. In choosing where to place his work, however, he displayed little intellectual arrogance, believing that he had a duty to promote socialist ideas as broadly as possible. He was thus always willing to write for an exceptionally wide range of audiences. The major outlet for most of his career was the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, for which he often acted as industrial correspondent, and he was considered for the editorship in 1930, but he also contributed regularly to minor professional journals, including the <span class="italic">Library Assistant</span>, and even to eccentric publications such as the <span class="italic">Aryan Path</span>, a theosophical journal dedicated to the promotion of Eastern spirituality, a project for which Cole had little but disdain. His articles were almost always lucid, accessible, and engaging, and exhibited neither the self-conscious intellectual complexity that dogged the contributions of many of his colleagues on the left nor the obsession with scientific method and quantification that increasingly characterized the work of his academic colleagues. Cole preserved his articles and pamphlets throughout his life, and they are now in Nuffield College library, Oxford, stretching over eight large volumes, a testament both to his productivity and to his breadth of interest.<br>
<br>Cole's private life was less fulfilling than his public endeavours. In August 1918 Cole married Margaret Isabel Postgate (1893&#150;1980) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30953/', "Cole, Dame Margaret Isabel")</script>], daughter of the classical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35582/', "John Percival Postgate")</script> and an active volunteer in socialist circles. The couple had one son and two daughters in a marriage that lasted forty-one years. They also jointly wrote a number of books and articles, including twenty-nine detective novels, which although not successful at the time have since become collectors' items. The marriage does not seem, however, to have been particularly happy. Despite his tendency to project a romantic, even sentimental, image in much of his writing, Cole had little interest in actual romantic attachment and even less in sexual relations, admitting openly to a lack of interest in &#145;passions of the flesh&#146;. Friends also recalled that his emotional attachments, such as they were, tended to be with men rather than women. He was openly fond of some of his male students, including the future leader of the Labour Party Hugh Gaitskell, although there is no evidence of any homosexual encounters either before or during his marriage. After her husband's death Margaret Cole commented on his sexual proclivities and inadequacies, both unkindly and comprehensively, in her popular biography <span class="italic">The Life of G. D. H. Cole</span>.<br>
<br>Marital difficulties were not the only example of Cole's strained personal interactions. Margaret Cole described him as a most &#145;Unsocial Socialist&#146; who got &#145;very little out of personal association with outside people except definite pieces of information&#146;, while others also dismissed his &#145;aloof&#146; and &#145;aristocratic&#146; manner  (Cole, <span class="italic">Growing up into Revolution</span>, 78&#150;9). He was widely accused of holding conservative views on issues stretching from cinemas and the wireless to women's clothes and American phrases, and later in the twentieth century some on the left even dismissed him as more of an old-fashioned tory radical than a real libertarian socialist. At least partly as a result, he appears to have been actively disliked by many of his most natural intellectual allies. Harold J. Laski, who shared many ideas with Cole in his guild socialist years, found him insufferable and rarely associated personally with him. Nor did Cole mellow with years. Indeed, blighted continually with ill health&#151;diabetes was diagnosed in 1931&#151;he exhibited an increasing degree of eccentricity. When he was elected to a research fellowship at Nuffield College after his retirement in 1957, many colleagues found him already surprisingly disconnected from everyday academic life; he reportedly told one research student that he believed he was already dead.<br>
<br>Despite the lack of close friendships and attachments, Cole was widely celebrated in left-wing intellectual circles throughout his life, and a collection of essays was prepared in his honour, some of which contained warm personal reminiscences, to be presented to him on his seventieth birthday. His death, in the North Western Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 14 January 1959, occurred before either the anniversary or the appearance of the book. At the time he was remembered most frequently for his major contribution to university teaching, to labour history, and to economic research. In subsequent years, however, labour history has declined as a subject of academic enquiry and Cole's own reputation as an economist has seriously diminished. Few, if any, scholars active in the late twentieth century believed that Cole fully understood either socialist economics or the importance of the Keynesian revolution. At the same time, on the other hand, his contributions to political theory increasingly attracted praise and attention. By the mid-1990s a number of political theorists had returned to <span class="italic">Social Theory</span> and <span class="italic">Guild Socialism Restated</span> to examine Cole's libertarian ideals and democratizing agenda in search of a pluralistic philosophy with which to replace an increasingly discredited statist socialism and social democracy. In this respect Cole's own judgement appears to have been sound, for he often suggested that of all his work it would be his contribution to guild socialism that posterity would treat most favourably.<br>
