<span class="headword">Lovell,  Robert</span>  (1771&#150;1796), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at his parents' home in Thomas Street in Bristol on 25 October 1771, the son of a wealthy Quaker, initially a cabinet-maker and later a pin manufacturer, Robert Lovell (<i>d</i>. 1804), and his first wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bourne (1741&#150;1781), a Quaker minister. He probably followed some business (he was described on his death as a pin manufacturer), but the vehemence of his <span class="italic">Bristoliad</span>, a satire in Churchill's style and not deficient in vigour, shows that he was ill at ease in the commercial atmosphere of Bristol. He estranged himself still further from his original circle when on 20 January 1794 he married Mary (1771&#150;1861/2), daughter of Stephen Fricker, a girl of much beauty and some talent, with whom he had one child, Robert Lovell the younger (<i>b</i>. 1795). Lovell's family disapproved of the match because she was not only a non-Quaker, but had become an actress after her father's bankruptcy. It is not precisely clear when Lovell first made Southey's acquaintance, but it was early enough for Southey to have become engaged to his sister-in-law, Edith, before Coleridge's visit to Bristol in August 1794. Lovell introduced the two poets to Joseph Cottle and before long Coleridge was betrothed to a third Fricker sister, Sara, whom he married on 14 November 1795. In the same month of August 1794 the three friends co-operated in the production of a wellnigh improvised three-act tragedy on the fall of Robespierre. Each wrote an act, but Lovell's was rejected as out of keeping with the others, and Southey filled the void. The tragedy was published as Coleridge's at Cambridge in September 1794. Southey and Lovell nevertheless combined to publish a joint volume of poetry under the title of <span class="italic">Poems by Bion and Moschus</span> (1794); this was mistaken for a translation, and so was reissued in 1795 in an edition bearing the authors' names. Southey's mature opinion of his own pieces may be inferred from the fact that he reprinted none of them. This notwithstanding, they were reprinted in Park's <span class="italic">British Poets</span> with the addition of the <span class="italic">Bristoliad</span>, which does not seem to have been published before.<br>
<br>Next to their poetry, the young men were chiefly occupied with the project for their Pantisocratic colony. This was an idealized democratic community of self-governing equals with no private ownership of land and an emphasis on living in harmony with nature. It was to be based in Kentucky, and Lovell was to have brought to it not only his wife but his brother and two sisters. The design had practically collapsed before Lovell's death from a fever contracted at Salisbury and aggravated by his travelling home without taking medical advice. Edith Southey, in Southey's absence, nursed him for three nights at the risk of her life. After his death in Bristol on 3 May 1796, Lovell's father refused all aid to his daughter-in-law on the ground of her having been an actress and she and her infant son were provided for by Southey. Mary Lovell lived in his family during his life, and afterwards with his daughter Kate until her death at the age of ninety. Robert Lovell the younger settled in London as a printer in 1824. Some years afterwards he went on a tour of Europe and mysteriously disappeared, last being heard of at Marseilles. Enquiries were made by the Foreign Office, and Henry Nelson Coleridge journeyed in quest of him, but no trace was ever discovered.<br>
