<span class="headword">Fisher,  Payne</span>  (1615/16&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was the eldest son of Payne Fisher (<i>fl</i>. 1616&#150;1645) of Nettleton, Dorset, and Chilton Candover, Hampshire, and Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Neale of Warnford, auditor to James I and Charles I. Fisher's career owed much to the generosity of his mother's extended family. Despite being the scion of an established gentry family (he was the grandson of Sir William Fisher), his father may have fallen on hard times, and Fisher later recalled that it was to his great-uncle, Sir Thomas Freke, that he owed his &#145;breeding and generous education&#146;  (Fisher, <span class="italic">Tombes</span>). Fisher's education began at St Paul's School, after which he was admitted to Hart Hall, Oxford, in September 1634, at the age of eighteen. After three years he migrated to Magdalene College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1638 as a pupil of John Puleyn. According to Anthony Wood, however, Fisher had &#145;a rambling head&#146; and he apparently left Cambridge for Brabant, &#145;and trailed a pike in the garrison of Bolduc&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.377). He returned to England to serve as an ensign during the bishops' wars, where he befriended the cavalier poet Richard Lovelace, before serving in the English army in Ulster after the outbreak of the Irish revolt. He served as an ensign under Sir John Clotworthy from December 1641 until September 1642, and subsequently became lieutenant. It was from this period in the field that Fisher's earliest verses survive. Largely written in Latin, and preoccupied with recent military events and renowned individuals of his day, they set the trend for his later works.<br>
<br>From Ireland Fisher joined his father in the service of the royal cause during the first civil war. While his father served as a captain of the king's lifeguard and was awarded an honorary MA at Oxford in April 1645, Fisher himself became a major in the regiment of foot under Sir Patrick Curwen, with the help of a letter of recommendation from the earl of Chichester. The evidence from unpublished poetry composed during this period&#151;which included an elegy on Viscount Falkland&#151;reveals Fisher to have been distinctly anti-puritan, and a supporter of the church policies of Archbishop William Laud. Fisher served the king in the field at Marston Moor, but following the royalist defeat he was conveyed as a prisoner to London and incarcerated in Newgate. There he was able to concentrate his efforts on writing, spending the period from July 1645 to July 1646 composing new verse and revising older poems.<br>
<br>It may have been through his pen, and the assistance of Clotworthy, that Fisher secured release after the end of the first civil war. As Wood noted, Fisher lived in London &#145;by his wits, favoured by his pen the successful rebellion, and as a true time-server (incident to most poets) ingratiated himself with the great men then in power&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.377). By October 1647 Fisher had reconciled himself to the parliamentarians and may have been considered for service in Ireland once again. He certainly published a substantial piece on recent Irish history (<span class="italic">Hyberniae lachrymae</span>) in 1648. Although he published a poem in opposition to the execution of Charles I in April 1649 (<span class="italic">Chronosticon decollationis Caroli regis</span>), he soon ingratiated himself with the republican government, with a poem inspired by the parliamentarian victory at Marston Moor, published in April 1650. This and Fisher's subsequent poems appeared under the name Payne (Pagani) or Fitzpayne (Fitzpaganus) Fisher (Piscatoris).<br>
<br>In December 1651 the council of state considered how to encourage Fisher's efforts, and in the months that followed he published verses in honour of Cromwell's victories (<span class="italic">Veni, vidi, vici</span> and <span class="italic">Irenodia gratulatoria</span>), which were dedicated to men such as John Bradshaw and contained evidence of assistance from republican authors such as Marchamont Nedham. Fisher was awarded &pound;50 and considered for employment in April 1652. Having petitioned the council for financial assistance with his writings, and to enable him to make a journey to Scotland, Fisher was awarded a further &pound;100 in September 1652, and allowed a pass to travel. Fisher was employed as historian of the victories achieved by the republican armies, and once in Scotland sought to secure information from regiments with which to compile his work. All that survives of his efforts, however, is a pictorial plan of the battle of Dunbar, and &#145;A perfect registry of all the collours taken from the Scots&#146;. The latter incorporated the arms of the members of the council of state, Fisher styling himself &#145;historiographer of his highnesse warres in Ireland and Scotland&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 1460, fol. 2).<br>
<br>Fisher subsequently penned verses to commemorate naval victories in 1653 (<span class="italic">Pro navali Anglorum</span>) and a series of panegyrics on prominent political figures. Most importantly, he produced poetry to laud Oliver Cromwell on his assumption of protectoral power in 1654 (<span class="italic">Panegyrici Cromwello</span> and <span class="italic">Inauguratio Olivariana</span>), and to commemorate the anniversaries of his inauguration (<span class="italic">Oratio anniversaria</span>, 1655, <span class="italic">Oratio secunda anniversaria</span>, 1657, and <span class="italic">Paean triumphalis in secundam inaugurationem</span>, 1657). Such work represented the fulfilment of his role as &#145;poet laureate&#146;, and it was published by official printers, with official backing, and with dedicatory verses by other Cromwellian authors. In 1655 Fisher styled himself &#145;Historiis et Satellitio Domini Protectoris&#146;  (<span class="italic">Apobaterion</span>), and it was reported that he prepared verses in expectation of the crowning of Cromwell in 1657. He certainly continued to present works to his employers in the hope of retaining official favour. In 1658 he published verses in memory of Admiral Robert Blake (<span class="italic">Epitaphium Roberti Blakii</span>) and delivered an elegy for Archbishop James Ussher in Oxford (<span class="italic">Armachanus redivivus</span>). Later in the year he attended Cromwell's funeral and published a series of poems in honour of the protector, at least some of which were dedicated to the new protector, Richard Cromwell (<span class="italic">In obitum serenissimi potentissimique principis</span>, <span class="italic">Threnodia triumphalis</span>, and <span class="italic">Panegyricus Cromwelli</span>). However, Fisher also used his talents as a means of ingratiating himself with the regime's most powerful individuals, by commemorating their political, military, and diplomatic deeds, as well as notable events in the lives of their families.<br>
<br>Arguably, Fisher sought to use both public and private elements of his career in order to secure financial rewards. He certainly petitioned the council for a pension late in 1654, and received &pound;100. He was also rewarded with employment as a gentleman of the lifeguard of General George Monck in Scotland, some time before November 1655. However, Wood also claimed that Fisher used his pen &#145;to shark money from those who delighted to see their names in print&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.377). The result is an unclear distinction between his public and private, published and unpublished, poetry, and an uncertain corpus of work. Some works written for specific individuals were printed but not published, although they occasionally reappeared in collections such as his <span class="italic">Piscatoris poemata</span> (1656), while officially inspired works could also be used, with suitable additional insertions, as a means of personal lobbying, in the hope of securing pecuniary benefit from powerful patrons. Fisher also used his pen in order to secure rewards from foreign powers. In 1656 he wrote verses to commemorate the Venetian victory over the Turks (<span class="italic">In celeberrimam Naumachiam</span>), and presented them to the Venetian ambassador in London in expectation of a reward, which proved forthcoming in the form of a medal (worth &pound;12) struck at the expense of the doge. In 1657 Fisher also dedicated one of his works to Cardinal Mazarin (<span class="italic">Paean triumphalis in secundam inaugurationem</span>) and in 1658 he commemorated the Anglo-French victory over Spain at the battle of the Dunes, and the capture of Dunkirk, in another work dedicated to Mazarin (<span class="italic">Epicinion vel elogium</span>).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Fisher turned his coat once again, and sought preferment within the new regime, not least by drawing attention to his royalist military service. In 1661 he and Nedham published a satirical account of <span class="italic">The speeches of Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, and John Bradshaw, intended to have been spoken at their execution at Tyburne, Jan. 30. 1660</span>, on the cover of which they were styled &#145;servants, poets and pamphleteers to his infernal highness&#146;. Fisher used presentation copies of his books in order to win the favour of, and secure loans from, men such as Samuel Pepys, and prepared verses in honour of both the English and French monarchs, copies of which were sent to Clarendon (<span class="italic">Chronosticon in decolationem Caroli regi</span>). Fisher also published poetry by James Howell in 1663 (<span class="italic">Poems on Several Choice and Various Subjects</span>), and continued to issue elegies regarding specific individuals, including a memorial for Monck, in order to secure financial rewards (<span class="italic">Heic jacet bellicosissimus ille Robertus Bartu</span>, 1668, <span class="italic">Elogium sepulchrale pro victoriosissimo Georgio Monacho</span>, 1670).<br>
<br>It was perhaps as a commercial venture that Fisher embarked on what proved to be one of his most substantial projects, and his most important historical achievement, the attempt to catalogue funeral monuments, tombs, and gravestones, as well as armorial and heraldic information, from around London, most notably the pre-fire St Paul's Cathedral (<span class="italic">The catalogue and account of many memorable persons who had visible tombs</span>, 1668; <span class="italic">The catalogue of most of the memorable tombes, grave-stones, plates, escutcheons or atchievements</span>, 1668). By July 1673, however, Fisher had been imprisoned in the Fleet for debt, after which his financial situation worsened along with his health. During 1675&#150;6 he sought once more to use his pen in order to secure the financial resources necessary to gain release, hoping to enlist the support of Joseph Williamson, to whom he sent manuscript copies of his heroic verses on the connection between church and state, published as <span class="italic">Deus et rex</span> and <span class="italic">Rex et episcopus</span>. Although Fisher remained in prison until at least 1684, he persisted in publishing ventures (<span class="italic">Impressio secunda carminis heroici</span>, 1675; <span class="italic">Impressio novissima carminis heroici</span>, 1677; <span class="italic">Utriusque primariis et publicis academiae luminibus</span>, 1677), and produced substantial volumes such as <span class="italic">A Synopsis of Heraldry</span> (1682), <span class="italic">The Atchievements of the Kings of England</span> (1682), and <span class="italic">The Tombes, Monuments and Sepulchral Inscriptions, Lately Visible in St Pauls Cathedral</span> (1684), which he continued to use in order both to flatter the monarch and to secure potential patrons with presentation copies.<br>
<br>Such efforts at personal advancement appear to have proved fruitless, however. Fisher probably remained in prison, or within the liberty of the Fleet, for much of the remainder of his life, and certainly remained in an impoverished state. Increasingly he used his published works in order to commemorate his own family. He had always used print in order to honour prominent kinsmen (<span class="italic">Miscellanea &hellip; in memoriam fratris Ferdinandi Fisheri</span>, 1655; <span class="italic">Integerrimo vere viro</span>, 1657; and <span class="italic">Juxta suorum cineres repulverescit</span>, 1690), but after 1660 this came to be a feature of even his most important books. Such comments serve to provide much of the information on which Fisher's biographer must rely, and which is otherwise lacking. However, documentary evidence is available to confirm that Fisher died at Bishops Court, Old Bailey, on 2 April 1693, and that he was buried three days later in the parish of St Sepulchre, London.<br>
