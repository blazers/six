<span class="headword">Perrins,  William Henry</span>  (1793&#150;1867), <span class="occ">sauce manufacturer</span>, was born into a farming family at Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, and baptized at St Cassian's Church there, one of three sons (there were also four daughters). Information is scant about Perrins's childhood, education, and first venture into business. He is known to have studied to be a chemist and, aged about twenty-eight, formed a partnership with his younger brother, James, as chemists and druggists. The partnership, based in Evesham, lasted until December 1822, when it was amicably dissolved and William continued alone. James then moved to Cheltenham to become a surgeon. Meanwhile, William replied to an advertisement for a partner in another chemist's shop, and joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39632/', "John Wheeley Lea")</script> in his business at 68 Broad Street, Worcester, on 1 January 1823. Three weeks later William travelled to Birkby, Yorkshire, where on 22 January he married Sarah Dyson, the daughter of Thomas Dyson of Huddersfield. In 1825 the partners opened their first branch shop in Vicar Street, Kidderminster, under the name of Lea, Perrins, and Court, the latter being its manager. Two further shops followed in Cheltenham (Lea and Perrins and Osborne, 1834) and Malvern (Lea and Perrins and Burrows, 1849).<br>
<br>By the late 1830s Perrins was well established in Worcester and had moved with his wife and five sons and one daughter to 11 Lansdowne Crescent, Claines. From their Worcester shop, the partners sold groceries, medicines, and cosmetics, and before 1840 Lea and Perrins turned their attention to producing a distinctive sauce to accompany meat and fish dishes. Labels on modern bottles of Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce show malt vinegar, spirit vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, anchovies, garlic, spices, and flavouring to be among the ingredients. However, the origin of the partners' initial recipe remains uncertain. Labels on the first bottles, dating from the early 1840s, describe the sauce as &#145;Prepared from the Recipe of a Nobleman in the County, and used with Cold Meats, Beef Steaks, Veal Cutlets, Chops, Curries, Fish, Games, and Soup&#146;. Mention of the nobleman soon sparked a colourful, if unsubstantiated, account explaining the exotic origin of the sauce. This told how one Sir Marcus Sandys, a former governor of Bengal, had returned to England in 1835 and asked the partners to make up a sauce from a recipe he had obtained while abroad. This they did, at the same time preparing a few gallons for themselves as a possible commercial line. On tasting their product they found it quite unpalatable and consigned it to the cellar. But, on opening the jars some months later, they found the now matured sauce delicious. While the story remains problematic, and no person named Sandys has been traced, by 1837 the partners are known to have been producing a sauce for retail. Within two years the sauce, which had already been marketed within British shipping lines, was also being imported by a New York distributor.<br>
<br>Away from business Perrins led a modest and civic-minded life. In 1862 he joined Lea in donating &pound;500 to the Worcester Royal Infirmary; two years later he gifted the chancel window to St Cassian's Church, Chaddesley Corbett, and in 1865 presented three stained-glass windows to St Nicholas's Church, Worcester, where his own children had been baptized. The church was later deconsecrated, but the windows remain. Perrins died from dropsy on 6 January 1867 at his home and was buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, Claines.<br>
<br>Perrins's son James Dyson joined the firm in 1857, soon after his marriage to his cousin, Frances Sarah Perrins, on 26 February 1856. He died on 26 February 1887 aged sixty-three, and his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35485/', "(Charles William) Dyson Perrins")</script>, was taken into the partnership in 1894, and later achieved note as a book and porcelain collector. The Lea family's association with the company had ended two years before, but Perrinses and Dysons continued to sit on the board of directors of Lea and Perrins, even after it was sold to HP Foods in 1930.<br>
