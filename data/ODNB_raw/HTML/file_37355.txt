<span class="headword">Desch,  Cecil Henry</span>  (1874&#150;1958), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born at 99 Hemingford Road, Islington, London, on 7 September 1874, the eldest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of Henry Thomas Desch, surveyor, and his wife, Harriet Ingerson, of Pilton, Devon. Desch was educated at Birkbeck School, Kingsland, Middlesex, and at the age of fifteen entered Finsbury Technical College, London, where Silvanus Thompson was principal. He spent two years studying organic chemistry and a further year as a research student in the laboratory of Raphael Meldola. He then joined F. Kendall &amp; Son, a firm of industrial chemists, in Stratford upon Avon, as assistant chemist, and took an external London BSc degree. He obtained a PhD at W&uuml;rzburg University in 1902, and then studied under Sir William Ramsay at University College, London, and was awarded a DSc.<br>
<br>Desch's first academic appointment in 1902 was to the metallurgy department of King's College, London. While there, Sir Flinders Petrie asked him to work on metal implements found during the excavations at Ur. From 1908 until 1918 he was lecturer in metallurgy at Glasgow University, and became professor of metallurgy at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, in 1918. In 1909 Desch married Elison Ann, the daughter of Professor Ivison Macadam, professor of chemistry at the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1920 to 1932 Desch was professor of metallurgy at Sheffield University. In 1932 he became superintendent of the department of metallurgy at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, Middlesex. He retired in 1939, but with the outbreak of the Second World War he became scientific adviser to the Iron and Steel Research Council and then entered the steel industry, becoming, in 1943, director of research of Richard Thomas &amp; Co. Ltd and, following reorganization, a director of the Whitehead Iron and Steel Company.<br>
<br>In 1923 Desch was elected FRS. He was president of the Faraday Society in 1926&#150;8. President of the Institute of Metals in 1938&#150;40, he was awarded their platinum medal in 1941. He was president of the Iron and Steel Institute (1946&#150;8), having received the Bessemer gold medal in 1938. He thus achieved distinction in both ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy.<br>
<br>As the author of many papers and books on metallurgical topics, Desch's most notable contribution was his book <span class="italic">Metallography</span>, which ran to six editions between 1910 and 1942. It was read with awe by generations of students who wondered how he succeeded in making such an interesting topic so boring. He was the forerunner of the modern professor of materials in that he wrote, with F. M. Lea, <span class="italic">The Chemistry of Cement and Concrete</span> (1956). He also published papers on social topics and had a great interest in historical metallurgy. Desch was a lithe man of military bearing whose presence commanded immediate respect. He died on 19 June 1958 in the General Hospital, Amersham, Buckinghamshire. He was survived by his wife.<br>
