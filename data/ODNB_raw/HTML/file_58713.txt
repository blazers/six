<span class="headword">Morice,  William</span>  (1733&#150;1819), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 28 January 1733, the second son of William Morice, high bailiff of Westminster from 1719 to 1731, of Delahay Street, Kensington, and his second wife, Anne (1705&#150;1743), daughter of Captain John Philpot of Rotherhithe. He matriculated at Hertford College, Oxford, on 8 December 1750, graduating BA in 1754 and MA in 1757. Ordained deacon on 16 May 1756 and priest on 6 March 1757, he served as curate at St Peter-le-Poer, London. On 2 September 1762 he married Hannah Voyce (1737&#150;1789), with whom he had seven children.<br>
<br>Richard Terrick, bishop of London, collated Morice in September 1767 to Wennington, Essex, and Frederick Cornwallis, archbishop of Canterbury, presented him to All Hallows, Bread Street, and St John the Evangelist, in September 1771. He began assisting Dr Daniel Burton, secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG), in 1768, and was himself elected secretary in 1778. Salters' Hall Company elected him lecturer in St Dunstan-in-the-East, Fleet Street, in December 1768. After being commissioned chaplain in the 103rd regiment of foot in June 1769, he was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the king in 1772. Archbishop Cornwallis conferred a DD degree on him in 1781.<br>
<br>Morice's career was notable for its dedication and efficiency. He served sixteen years as a curate, forty-five as rector of Wennington, forty-eight at All Hallows and St John the Evangelist, and fifty-one years in service to the SPG. He regularly conducted two Sunday services at All Hallows and for twenty years he delivered the Thursday evening lecture. A notice of the bishop's visitation received on 9 March 1790 was answered the next day. His tenure with the SPG is noted for consistent attendance and diligence in his duties, for example in managing all books and papers and waiting upon the archbishop of Canterbury (president of the society) and the bishop of London, in whose overseas diocese missionaries served. Morice prepared and published annual reports with sermon for distribution to all members. Copies of his correspondence fill seven volumes. In addition to official minutes, he kept a private account of the society from 1751 to 1819.<br>
<br>Major events during Morice's years with the SPG were the American War of Independence and the challenge to provide missionaries for Canada. The SPG charter of 1701 limited their service to British possessions. By 1781 the society knew it had to discontinue work in the independent states but it offered continued employment to those who repaired to the king's dominions. It was Morice's responsibility to inform the missionaries of this and help to arrange new assignments. In 1778 the SPG had ninety-four missionaries registered in the independent states but by 1785 there were none. Canada and its neighbouring provinces had twenty-two missionaries in 1785. That same year parliament directed that Canada should be divided into parishes, and provided the society with a grant. The consecration on 12 August 1787 of Charles Inglis, a loyalist missionary from New York and the first colonial bishop, assigned to Nova Scotia, initiated a new era in the society's work. Inglis's consecration fulfilled the SPG's desire for local supervision of their missionaries and Morice's co-operation with Inglis provided seventy-nine appointees to Canada and neighbouring provinces by 1818.<br>
<br>Morice was described as &#145;firm&#146; and &#145;friendly&#146;. His greeting was &#145;your affectionate brother and humble servant&#146;. His resignation in 1814 was withdrawn at the request of Archbishop Charles Manners-Sutton. The qualities that characterized his SPG service were evident in his family relations. His journal reveals affection and encouragement towards his children. Two of his sons, William and Henry, followed his clerical example. A third son, Burton, a barrister, became secretary to the lord chamberlain. His desire was to be buried beside his daughter Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 6 May 1775) and wife, Hannah, beneath the communion table in All Hallows, Bread Street. He died at his home, 53 Gower Street, London, on 7 January 1819. Archbishop Charles Manners-Sutton described him as &#145;their Venerable Secretary &hellip; zealous and faithful &hellip; upwards of 50 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">SPG Minutes</span>, 32, 1819&#150;20, 22).<br>
