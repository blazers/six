<span class="headword">Nunn, Sir  (Thomas) Percy</span>  (1870&#150;1944), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 28 December 1870 in Bristol, the second son of Edward Smith Nunn (<i>d</i>. 1890) and his wife, Harriette (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Luff). Both his father and grandfather were schoolmasters, and in 1873 their proprietary school was transferred to Weston-super-Mare. There Nunn received his own education and began to teach. He subsequently studied at Bristol University College. His interests at this time included the writing and producing of school plays and the making of scientific instruments. In 1890, on the death of his father, Nunn decided against taking over responsibility for management of the school. In the same year he gained a London BSc degree; he took the degrees of BA in 1895 and MA in 1902. In 1894 he married Eliza Alice (Ethel), daughter of Edmund John Hart, a carter. Their daughter, Elsa, also obtained a London MA, in 1929, and was principal of Fishponds Training College, Bristol (1930&#150;54).<br>
<br>Nunn taught in schools in Halifax and London, where by 1903 he was senior science master at the William Ellis School. From March of that year he was engaged on a part-time basis by the London Day Training College (LDTC) to demonstrate methods of teaching mathematics and science. In 1905 he was appointed vice-principal there. In 1913 he was accorded the title of professor of education by the University of London, and in 1922 he succeeded John (later Sir John) Adams as principal at the LDTC. Nunn's personality and educational philosophy were to exercise a considerable influence over the LDTC and more widely. An early contribution to the nature of scientific knowledge was <span class="italic">The Aim and Achievements of Scientific Method: an Epistemological Essay</span> (1907), a study based on his London University doctoral thesis, presented in the same year. Publications of 1912&#150;14 intended for classroom teachers included a co-authored <span class="italic">First Class Book of Chemistry</span> and two volumes on algebra. He also served as editor of <span class="roman">Black's Elementary Science Series</span> and in 1923 wrote a study entitled <span class="italic">Relativity and Gravitation</span>.<br>
<br>But the work for which Nunn became best known was <span class="italic">Education: its Data and First Principles</span>, written in the concluding years of the First World War and published in 1920. Its central thesis was &#145;that nothing good enters into the human world except in and through the free activities of individual men and women and that educational practice must be shaped to accord with that truth&#146;  (T. P. Nunn, <span class="italic">Education</span>, 1920, 5). This book went through three editions and more than twenty reprints, and was required reading for student teachers for some forty years.<br>
<br>Nunn presided over a number of important changes at the LDTC, including the establishment of a department for higher degrees and research and a colonial department (1927). He was knighted in 1930. Two years later the academic status and international role which Nunn had fostered were recognized by the transmutation of the LDTC into the London University Institute of Education. In spite of the talented team which Nunn collected around him, including Cyril Burt, Fred Clarke, H. R. Hamley, Susan Isaacs, and Marion Richardson, his authority and pre-eminence were unquestioned. As another colleague, P. Gurrey, wrote:<blockquote>Over this collection Nunn towered in every way: intellectual ability, force of character, and width of interest and knowledge. There was no doubt about our realisation of his supreme position as a thinker, organiser, mathematician and teacher. The legend of Nunn did not grow after he had left us: we saw it growing. (A. S. Harrison and others, 46)</blockquote>Nunn, however, was always accessible. His personal charm and whimsical humour were coupled with a great gift for explaining complex issues in simple and clear language. One of his former students, G. B. Jeffery, who in 1945 succeeded Clarke as director of the institute, recalled of Nunn that:<blockquote>He never talked down to you. He put himself by your side ready to share your enthusiasms, taking it for granted that you would share his. You were learning and he was learning; you were learning together. The remarkable thing is that it was perfectly true. In teaching you, his vivid and adventurous mind was sure to see some new light and you shared the discovery together. (ibid., 14)</blockquote>Nunn's interests were boundless. He had a great admiration for Plato and bought a Greek fount for his printing press so that he could produce Greek quotations and verses. He also took great delight in music, both classical and light, and penned parodies for LDTC concerts&#151;from &#145;Phyllis was a Fair Maid&#146; to &#145;Knocked 'em in Southampton Row&#146;. Yet in spite of his commitment to all aspects of the life of the LDTC and institute, and of the university, he also played significant roles in the Aristotelian Society, the British Association, the British Psychological Society, the Mathematical Association, and the Training College Association. In his later years Nunn's prodigious workload began to take its toll and he suffered considerably from bronchitis and emphysema. He found increasing difficulty in breathing in foggy weather and in climbing stairs (the five-storey Southampton Row building had no lifts). In 1932 he spent most of an intended recuperation cruise in the ship's hospital, and on his return to London he was diagnosed as suffering from extreme exhaustion. In 1936 he retired to Funchal, Madeira, where he died on 12 December 1944; he was buried on 13 December at the British cemetery, Funchal.<br>
<br>Nunn was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Liverpool, St Andrews, and Trinity College, Dublin. The status accorded to <span class="italic">Education</span> has been questioned by such academics as J. W. Tibble  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Educational Studies</span>, 10, 1961, 58&#150;75), and in <span class="italic">All Must Have Prizes</span> (1996) the journalist Melanie Phillips included Nunn&#151;who wrote chapters in <span class="italic">Education</span> on the importance of &#145;Play&#146; and &#145;Freedom in Education&#146;&#151;among those whom she accused of promoting &#145;cranky views&#146;  (Phillips, 203). Indeed Nunn himself, in company with many of his students, would probably have placed his lectures and writings in the field of teaching mathematics and science above his treatment of educational principles. But his commitment in <span class="italic">Education</span> to the roles of the individual and of individuality in education was of central importance in a world that was increasingly dominated by totalitarian regimes. His gravestone in the British cemetery at Funchal bears a fitting epitaph: &#145;Teacher, Philosopher, Mathematician. Revered by the Academic World, Mourned by his Disciples, Loved by his Friends&#146;.<br>
