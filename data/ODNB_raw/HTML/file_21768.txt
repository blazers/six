<span class="headword">Peele,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1556, <em>d.</em> 1596), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was baptized on 25 July 1556 in the parish of St James Garlickhythe, London, probably the fourth of the five surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56446/', "James Peele (d. 1585)")</script>, clerk of Christ's Hospital, and his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1579). By 1562 the family had moved to St Olave Jewry. In its various forms, including Pile, Pill, Piel, and Pell, the Peele family name has been traced to Devon, the north country, Norfolk, Kent, Monaco, and Normandy. James Peele was the author of two works on double-entry bookkeeping, <span class="italic">The Maner and Fourme How to Kepe a Perfecte Reconyng</span> (1553) and <span class="italic">The Pathe Waye to Perfectnes</span> (1569). A respected citizen and salter of London, James was also responsible for city pageants, and he was the clerk of Christ's Hospital, the second in its history, from 1562 until his death.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>From 1556 until 1571 George Peele lived and was educated in the grounds of Christ's Hospital, a charitable institution for orphans, the elderly, and the poor. In 1571 he was living in Broadgates Hall, Oxford, across the street from Christ Church where he was residing by December 1574. He took his BA (1577) and MA (1579) from Christ Church, the latter degree one year before the normally required time. His earliest literary efforts and colleagues were Oxonian. The efforts included the no longer extant translation of Euripides' <span class="italic">Iphigenia</span>; the colleagues featured Thomas Watson (to whose verse collection, <span class="italic">Hekatompathia</span>, Peele addressed a commendatory poem in 1582) and William Gager, the Latin playwright who commended Peele's translation of Euripides in two Latin poems. Gager's poems praise Peele's classicism, as well as his mixture of sobriety and humour. They also offer a physical description of someone who might be Peele as &#145;strangely short of leg, dark of complexion, squint-eyed, and red-haired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 1.45).<br>
<br>In 1579, the year of his mother's death, Peele was back in London at his father's house, for court documents dating from September of that year record his father's compliance with an order to have his son among other occupants removed from the premises of Christ's Hospital. Until recently, this document has been used as evidence that Peele lived a rowdy, immoral life; recent biographers prefer the explanation that James Peele was facing hard times  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 1.47&#150;9). Back in Oxford, George married a sixteen-year-old girl named Anne Cooke or Christian (<i>bap</i>. 1564, <i>d</i>. 1587?), the wedding taking place between early March and 18 October 1580. Her father's legacy produced legal disputes over property that would require the attention of the newly-weds for four years. Among the array of legal particulars assembled by David Horne  (ibid., 1.50&#150;57), one deposition given by George mentions the fact that he moved to London in 1581.<h2>
<a name="Poemsandplays"></a>Poems and plays</h2>As Gager attests, Peele had commenced his literary work at Oxford. One of his first poems, <span class="italic">The Tale of Troy</span>, was probably written after his MA but in his last years of residence in Oxford, about 1580&#150;81. First published in 1589, this poem in couplets was based on a variety of sources, especially Caxton, and it manifests Peele's continuing interest in antiquity. <span class="italic">The Tale of Troy</span> also inaugurates his tendency to mingle diverse genres or registers, in this case the chivalric and pastoral kinds so attractive to his contemporaries. Its focus on Trojan history would suit his audience as well, for Troy was imagined by the Elizabethans to have produced the origins of their own history.<br>
<br>In June 1583 Peele was consulted on the entertainment planned for the Oxford visit of Albertus Alasco, count palatine of Siradia, Poland. Peele was living in London, where he added plays to his poetic output. Of his five extant and complete plays, <span class="italic">The Arraignment of Paris</span> most reflects the influence of his university days. Performed before the queen by the children of the chapel between 1581 and 1584, it stages a mythological and pastoral treatment of one episode in the Trojan saga, the judgment of Paris. As in the case of his fellow Oxonian John Lyly, Peele's court drama was meant to please and praise Queen Elizabeth. It is possible that the fragmentary &#145;Hunting of Cupid&#146; was another such attempt: it survives as excerpts in two miscellanies&#151;<span class="italic">England's Helicon</span> (1600) and <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> (1600)&#151;as well as in a 1609 transcription by William Drummond.<br>
<br>Like his father, Peele was enlisted to devise mayoral pageants for the city of London. Two of these are extant: <span class="italic">The Device of the Pageant Borne before Wolstan Dixi</span> (1585) and <span class="italic">Descensus Astraeae</span> (1591), the latter composed for the installation of William Webbe. In Peele's strange afterlife as a jest-book hero, he is remembered for his expertise in the composition of masques and pageants, and spectacle of one kind or another is a feature of his two main types of literary invention in the last years of his life: occasional poems in congratulation of various dignitaries, and dramas written for the professional theatre.<br>
<br>The occasions for Peele's verses included these: the departure of Sir John Norris and Sir Francis Drake on a naval mission against the Spanish (<span class="italic">A Farewell: Entituled to the Famous and Fortunate Generalls of our English Forces</span>, published with <span class="italic">The Tale of Troy</span> in 1589); the return of Robert, earl of Essex, from the Norris&#150;Drake mission, for which Peele chooses Spenserian pastoral (<span class="italic">An Eclogue Gratulatorie: Entituled, To the Honorable Shepheard of Albions Arcadia</span>, 1589); two accession days for Elizabeth (<span class="italic">Polyhymnia Describing, the Honourable Triumph at Tylt</span>, 1590, and <span class="italic">Anglorum feriae</span>, 1595); and an induction ceremony into the Order of the Garter for Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, the famous &#145;wizard earl&#146; (<span class="italic">The Honour of the Garter: Displaied in a Poeme Gratulatorie</span>, 1593). Like so many such occasions, these events presented Peele with challenges to the rhetoric of his praise. In celebrating the return of Essex from the Norris&#150;Drake enterprise, Peele risked casting a negative light on the anti-Spanish mission that he had so recently lauded. The tilting ceremony behind <span class="italic">Polyhymnia</span> was the last for the master of the armoury, Sir Henry Lee; Peele faced the challenge of praising an old order and a new. Sometimes occasions skewed the balance of Peele's poetry of praise: in the mayoral show <span class="italic">Descensus Astraeae</span> he bestowed much more attention on the queen than he did on the lord mayor.<br>
<br>In the poems as in the plays, Peele develops a variety of English verse forms, not least the newly powerful and supple blank verse. Elizabethan anthologists commonly looked to him for selections to include in their miscellanies; for instance, his poem &#145;The Praise of Chastity&#146; appeared in the 1593 miscellany entitled <span class="italic">The Phoenix Nest</span>. In quatrains rhyming <i>abab</i>, the poem seeks to prove &#145;by way of comparison, how great is the conquest over our affections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 1.260). If Peele indeed wrote the &#145;sonet&#146; appended to some copies of <span class="italic">Polyhymnia</span>, its three stanzas of six lines each, with a quatrain of alternating rhymes followed by a couplet, show his capacity for great lyric beauty.<br>
<br>Aside from some excellent lyric passages, Peele's occasional verse offers historical evidence about Elizabethan politics, patronage, and manners with little in the way of literary merit. His enduring monument was dramatic rather than panegyric. It is impossible to know with certainty when Peele's four professional plays were written or performed. But there is some consensus that <span class="italic">The Battle of Alcazar</span> was his first  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 2.221&#150;6). Acted by the Lord Admiral's Servants, it survives in its 1594 edition as well as in a handwritten plot outline indicative of a longer version of the play (BL, Add. MS 10449). But the play was probably written not long after the defeat of the Armada. Although its patriotic themes, exotic and homegrown character types, and theatrical devices are common enough in plays of his time, Peele's inventive combination of elements renders <span class="italic">The Battle of Alcazar</span> something of its own kind. So it is with much of Peele's theatrical work: what stands out is the combination of elements, not any one element in its own right.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Battle of Alcazar</span> divides its attention between three main groups. First there are the North African Moors whose custom of having brothers succeed one another to the throne has been transgressed by the son of one of the brothers. For English audiences, it would seem natural for a son to succeed a father according to the custom of primogeniture, and so the very premise of the play is as exotic as the setting. The transgressing son, Muly Mahamet or &#145;The Moor&#146;, is Peele's version of Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine, a passionately ambitious warrior whose fustian blank verse was lampooned by other playwrights of the time. Into the African contest for succession come two European groups of characters, each with its share of ambition if not spoken in the Moor's high-pitched pentameter. One group centres on King Sebastian of Portugal, the other on Thomas Stukeley, a renegade English Catholic whose plan to seize Ireland in rebellion against Elizabeth somehow did not prevent him from becoming a popular hero. It helps, no doubt, that he is distracted from rebellion by the prospect of glory in northern Africa. The play makes use of two spectacular stage devices: the commentary of a presenter and the foreshadowing of the dumb show. These devices are especially helpful in keeping the audience on top of a complicated plot with its strange notions of succession. But the themes of the play could not be more familiar to Elizabethan audiences: the perils of illegitimate succession, of rebellion, and of ambition. Along the way, Peele makes sure that a character offers praise for Elizabeth and her protestant nation.<br>
<br>Of Peele's next two plays, <span class="italic">Edward I</span> and <span class="italic">The Old Wives Tale</span>, the former is a chronicle play with strong anti-Spanish sentiment. It is much harder to say what, generically or tonally, the latter play is. First published in 1593, <span class="italic">Edward I</span> was well received by Elizabethan audiences&#151;hardly surprising, given its fervently anti-Catholic characterization of Queen Elinor. Between August 1595 and the next July, Henslowe recorded fourteen performances of a play called <span class="italic">Longshanks</span>, very likely an alias for Peele's chronicle play  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 2.7&#150;8). There was a second edition in 1599. The play's central theme of legitimate monarchy quashing rebellion in Wales and Scotland was sure to earn approval from Peele's audience. The playwright shows his liking for spectacular scenes when, as the title-page announces, he stages &#145;the sinking of Queene <i>Elinor</i>, who sunck <i>at</i> <i>Charingcrosse</i><i>, and rose againe at</i> <i>Pottershith</i>, now named Queenehith&#146;  (ibid., 2.69). More inventively, if less marvellously, Peele also writes in a range of forms, from blank verse and tetrameter couplets to prose.<br>
<br>Peele's most famous and unusual play, <span class="italic">The Old Wives Tale</span>, leaves behind the lofty narrative region of the chronicle for the homely realm of the folk-tale. But with its elements of chivalric and fairy stories, the play's tone and genre are hard to measure, notwithstanding the 1595 title-page on which the play is dubbed &#145;A pleasant conceited Comedie, played by the Queenes Maiesties players&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 3.385). The play's simplicity is made all the more deceptive by its central device: rather than simply weave together strands of action in the manner of a history play, it interrelates zones of dramatic reality. At the outermost level, two pages with allegorical names (Frolicke and Fantasticke) spend a night listening to an old, amiable, and ingenuous housewife tell &#145;a merry winters tale&#146;  (ibid., 3.390). The tale itself sprawls from a beautiful princess captured by a sorcerer; to her brothers and a lover who seek her in the woods; to the young man transformed by the sorcerer into, alternately, an old man and a bear, together with the young man's wife driven mad by the sorcerer; to the opposite daughters of an unhappy father, both of whom&#151;one ugly, the other beautiful&#151;must seek their fortune in a special well. This summary omits the play's most notorious character, a braggart soldier named Huanebango whose foolish pomposity is arguably based on Peele's contemporary Gabriel Harvey (Frank Hook reviews the evidence and questions the Harvey parallels: ibid., 3.311&#150;19). But the most extraordinary feature of the play is that as the old wife tells the two pages her story in all simplicity, the characters appear before the very eyes of the threesome. As the various strands and motifs of the tale unfold before them, Frolicke and Fantasticke persist in questioning the wife about the play within the narrative within the play that they witness.<br>
<br>If <span class="italic">The Old Wives Tale</span> testifies to Peele's belief in the power of even the simplest and most familiar stories, his fourth play for the professional theatre&#151;<span class="italic">The Love of King David and Fair Bethsabe: with the Tragedie of Absalon</span>&#151;ventures to dramatize the holy scriptures themselves. Published posthumously in 1599 but written between 1592 and 1594, <span class="italic">David and Bethsabe</span> takes as its focus the sins of David, Ammon, and Absalon as they are set forth in <span class="roman">2 Samuel</span>, sins including adultery and treachery (David), rape and incest (Ammon), and rebellion (Absalon). Like his plays based on medieval and contemporary history, Peele's biblical drama explores the ways in which divine providence corrects human propositions, a more sober and conventional sense of diverse and interlocking realities than the lighthearted yet mysterious narrative device of <span class="italic">The Old Wives Tale</span>. Thrice excerpted in the miscellany <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span>, <span class="italic">David and Bethsabe</span> also contains some of Peele's best verse.<br>
<br>Several other plays have been attributed to Peele, though most scholars now agree that only the fragmentary &#145;Hunting of Cupid&#146; and the no longer extant <span class="italic">Turkish Mahomet and Hiren the Fair Greek</span> can safely be credited to him. Scholars have also divided on the question of whether Peele himself acted on the Elizabethan stage, with Peele's most exhaustive recent biographer, David Horne, deciding against the playwright's acting career  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 1.83&#150;7).<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>It is possible that in the last decade of his life Peele was widowed in 1587 and married to one Mary Yates (or Gates) on 26 December 1591. But whatever his marital history, his financial and physical fortunes took a downward turn. On 17 January 1596 he sent via his elder daughter a presentation copy of <span class="italic">The Tale of Troy</span> to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. In the dedication, Peele complained of a long, enfeebling illness and attributed his boldness to necessity. Burghley responded by filing the request for patronage together with others made by those supplicants least worthy of any response. According to records for the parish of St James Clerkenwell, Peele died later that year&#151;he was buried at St James's on 9 November 1596.<br>
<br>By the end of his life, Peele still retained some measure of his identity as a gentlemanly scholar with connections to the world of Oxford. But he was far more decisively identified as a professional playwright whose home was London. The author of <span class="italic">Greene's Groatsworth of Wit</span> (1592) placed Peele together with Marlowe and Thomas Nashe as fellow playwrights abused by the scapegrace players. In <span class="italic">A Knights Conjuring</span> (1607), Thomas Dekker located Peele in the Elysium of poets, a paradise dominated by Chaucer and Spenser but with Robert Greene, Nashe, Marlowe, and Peele in their own circle. Dekker's scene suggests that while the four are gentleman poets to be sure, they belong together as professional writers unable to rely on &#145;dry-fisted Patrons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knight's Conjuring</span>, ed. Robbins, 156). But Peele's afterlife offered much more about his life than simply his beleaguered station as a professional playwright. In <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598), Francis Meres not only ranked Peele among the best of England's poets and tragedians, but also claimed that the Oxford wit had died of the pox.<br>
<br>Meres's report of the playwright's syphilis, however, pales in comparison to the treatment of the protagonist in <span class="italic">The Merry Conceited Jests of George Peele</span> (1607). Some ten years after Peele's death, the biggest mystery of his life commenced, namely, how he came to be made into a jest-book hero whose decadence might explain his illness and whose prodigality might explain his poverty. This George is a witty, prodigal trickster who spends his time making merry in taverns; spending money and wit with a breathless velocity; devising exploits for fun and profit; wenching like a &#145;lecherous animal&#146;; and idly wasting his dramatic talent on knavery and dodges. The jests trumpet George's scholarly and literary talents: he has &#145;all the oversight of the pageants&#146; and is hired to translate a Greek book into English  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.391, 381). He is heralded as an &#145;excellent poet&#146; and as a well-known playwright  (ibid., 2.389). But these talents are miserably if humorously misspent with a prodigal wastefulness commonly attributed to the wittiest English writers of Peele's generation. George shows up as just such a wastrel in the character of George Pyeboard, featured in a 1607 play called <span class="italic">The Puritan</span> and written by W. S.<br>
<br>It is simply impossible to know for certain why, or how justly, Peele was chosen over, say, Thomas Nashe for the dubious honour of starring as a gentleman knave in a jest-book. For many years, at least until the twentieth-century scholarship of Thorleif Larsen and David Horne altered the case, Peele scholars tended to assume that the jest-book was essentially right about the poet. Had he not been removed from his father's house at Christ's Hospital? Had he not died of the pox? Was there not at least some fire where there was much smoke? Horne in particular, however, has retorted that the &#145;merry conceited jests&#146; are virtually all conventional  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 1.110&#150;26). It might be noted, too, that Peele's writings (one thinks of such unimpeachable poems as &#145;The Praise of Chastity&#146;) never come close to the kind of erotic satire found, say, in Nashe's &#145;A Choice of Valentines&#146; or in Marlowe's translation of Ovid's <span class="italic">Amores</span>. Whatever Peele's own proximity to the hero of the jest-book, he embodied for some of his contemporaries the perils of waste in an Elizabethan literary life begun in scholarship, offered out for patronage, and ended in the squalor of a professional playwright's meagre existence. But it is also typical of this character that he never loses the abundance and energy of his wit.<br>
<br>Nothing solidifies the contemporary choice of Peele to embody the brilliance yet peril of Elizabethan poets and playwrights more than the address to him in <span class="italic">Greene's Groatsworth of Wit</span>:<blockquote>And thou no lesse deserving than the other two, in some things rarer, in nothing inferiour; driven (as my selfe) to extreme shifts, a litle have I to say to thee: and were it not an idolatrous oth, I would sweare by sweet S. George, thou art unworthy better hap, sith thou dependest on so meane a stay. (<span class="italic">Greene's Groatsworth of Wit</span>, 83)</blockquote>Whether or not Peele was loose in his living, it is certain that by the end of his life, his mainstay was &#145;so meane a stay&#146;, the actors of the Elizabethan stage. For however much praise Peele had bestowed on Drake and Norris, on Essex and Northumberland, on mayors and a queen, his appeal to Burghley demonstrates just how ignominiously a literary life in search of patronage often turned out, even for one with &#145;oversight of the pageants&#146;. In 1604 Peele's old workhorse for patrons, <span class="italic">The Tale of Troy</span>, was published in a revised edition, and did him just as much good as it had done him in the presentation copy to Burghley. Thomas Nashe understood the burden of that poem: &#145;Others are so hardly bested for loading that they are faine to retaile the cinders of <span class="italic">Troy</span>, and the shivers of broken trunchions, to fill up their boate that else should goe empty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Works</span>, 1.80).<br>
