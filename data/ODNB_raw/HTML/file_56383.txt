<span class="headword">Young,  Andrew  McLaren</span>  (1913&#150;1975), <span class="occ">art historian</span>, was born on 19 September 1913, at the manse, Southend, Argyll, the eldest child and the only son of three children of the Revd Robert Comingo Young (1882&#150;1946), Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Olga Parsons (1890&#150;1939). From 1926 to 1930 McLaren Young was educated at Jamaica College, in Kingston, where his father was a missionary, and his speech always retained a distinctive Caribbean drawl. Later he attended George Watson's College, Edinburgh (1931&#150;2), and the University of Edinburgh (1932&#150;8). Originally intending to follow his father into the ministry, under David Talbot Rice's influence he became interested in the history of art, and although matriculating in 1933, left in 1938 without taking his degree. After a year's temporary attachment at the Tate Gallery, he was commissioned in the King's Own Yorkshire light infantry in 1939, served in Burma and north Africa, being wounded in Sicily. He was demobilized as a captain in 1945. He had married Margaret (Margie) Heath Halse (<i>b</i>. 1919) in 1940; they had a daughter, Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1944), and a son, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1951).<br>
<br>From 1946 to 1949 McLaren Young was assistant curator at the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, University of Birmingham. Then, in 1949, he was appointed senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow, with the task of establishing an art history department. He fostered high academic standards, and in 1965 the university awarded him an honorary MA on his appointment as Richmond professor of fine art. He began his life's work on James McNeill Whistler while at Glasgow, where the Birnie Philip collection&#151;given by Whistler's sister-in-law&#151;formed an important adjunct both to the eighteenth-century foundation collection of William Hunter and to two fine print collections. McLaren Young also planned, and fund-raised for, the new Hunterian Art Gallery, demonstrating his flair as a museum curator. The Whistler and Charles Rennie Mackintosh exhibitions which he organized in 1960 and 1968 respectively were models of scholarship and sensitive re-creations of period ambience. An inspiring leader, McLaren Young was widely read and generous towards younger scholars. Wittily caustic, he was a large man in every sense: one moment he could explode in fury, and the next, invite one to share a fine malt whisky.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1975 McLaren Young collapsed from a heart attack at the Royal Academy J. M. W. Turner Exhibition, and died on the way to hospital. He was buried at Keil Com Keil, Southend, Argyll. His memorials are the Whistler oil paintings <i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i>, finished by three colleagues and published in 1980, and the new Hunterian Art Gallery, much enriched by acquisitions and benefactions secured by him.<br>
