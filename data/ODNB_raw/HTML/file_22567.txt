<span class="headword">Porter,  George Richardson</span>  (1792&#150;1852), <span class="occ">civil servant and statistician</span>, was born in London, the son of a merchant. Educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, he traded from 1813 in sugar and wine from various London addresses. About 1820 he married Sarah, daughter of Abraham Ricardo and sister of David Ricardo. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22578/', "Sarah Porter (1790&#150;1862)")</script> wrote several works on education. In 1831 George Porter contributed to Charles Knight's <span class="italic">Companion to the Almanac</span> for 1831. When Knight declined Lord Auckland's invitation to work for the Board of Trade he recommended Porter instead. The post was temporary, but from 31 January 1834 he became permanent superintendent of the board's new statistical department, with a salary of &pound;525 p.a. Hitherto, each demand from parliament for statistics had required a tailor-made reply. The role of the statistical office was to produce the main series in print and to keep it up to date, so that it would be much simpler to provide the figures requested. Better data could also help in the formation of policy on major questions such as the corn laws. Although much information was collected, it was too little to contribute decisively to major issues. This was not entirely Porter's fault. With only a handful of clerks he had to get much of his information from sources such as chambers of commerce. If they failed to supply it, he could not compel them to do so. His department's work appeared in a series of reports, known as <span class="roman">Porter's tables</span>, from 1833 until his death.<br>
<br>Porter took part at least once in trade negotiations with a foreign government, namely France. Following the <span class="roman">Railway Regulation Act</span> of 1840, the Board of Trade set up a railway department. Porter was given the additional responsibility of supervising it. One wag asked whether he had statistics &#145;to show how many of any 100 men would survive for one month a journey of 50 miles in winter in a second or third class carriage on the GWR&#146;  (Parris, 95). The new work brought Porter in contact with leading figures such as George Hudson and Robert Stephenson. Porter was senior member of the railway board in 1844&#150;5. In 1846 the whigs transferred responsibility to a new body, the commissioners of railways. Porter applied in vain for one of these posts. By this time his salary was &pound;1200 p.a., including a special increment of &pound;200 for the railway work. This rose to &pound;1500 when he succeeded John MacGregor as joint secretary in August 1847. He retained this post until his death.<br>
<br>Porter was a founder member of the Statistical Society in 1834, and read papers to the statistical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1838 and a member of the Political Economy Club in 1841. His best-known publication was <span class="italic">The progress of the nation in its social and commercial relations from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present day</span> (3 vols., 1836&#150;43), which ran into several editions. It has been criticized for its author's indifference to economic organization, industrial processes, and the trade cycle. He wrote on other subjects as diverse as the cultivation of sugar and tropical agriculture. Porter was a staunch free-trader. When Lord John Russell failed to form a government in 1845, Porter wrote: &#145;The turn which things have taken is &hellip; most satisfactory. The Whig party would have entered upon their task with great doubt of success. Some of them were &hellip; unwilling converts to the cause and some would even think more of the advantages of office than of the task &hellip; for &hellip; which alone they would have been called to office&#146;  (McCord, 199). In successfully urging his claims to the joint secretaryship in 1847, he used the argument that his appointment would be popular with businessmen because of his known support of free trade. Towards the end of his life he lived at Putney Heath, but died on 3 September 1852 at Tunbridge Wells, where he was buried. The immediate cause of death was an insect bite on the knee which caused mortification.<br>
