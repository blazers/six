<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Charles Rivers</span>  (1831&#150;1916), <span class="occ">civil servant and financier</span>, was born in Montagu Square, London, on 19 February 1831, the eldest son of Melvil Wilson (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1800&#150;<i>c</i>.1860), merchant, and of his wife, Louise, daughter of Major-General Sir Benjamin Charles Stephenson GCH (1766&#150;1839). He was educated at Eton College (1845&#150;8) and at Balliol College, Oxford (1850&#150;53), and graduated in law and modern history.<h2>
<a name="PostsintheTreasury"></a>Posts in the Treasury</h2>Wilson was nominated by Palmerston, the prime minister, for the new examination for the Treasury, which he entered as a clerk in February 1856. Within three months he was appointed private secretary to James Wilson (1805&#150;1860), financial secretary to the Treasury. Thereafter he became secretary to G. A. Hamilton (1802&#150;1871), permanent under-secretary to the Treasury from 1858 to 1868, and then secretary to Robert Lowe, chancellor of the exchequer from 1868 to 1873. On 12 May 1860 he married Caroline Coke (1835/6&#150;1888). They had no children.<br>
<br>After turning down a financial post in Jamaica in 1866, Wilson served for seven months from August 1867 as acting private secretary to Disraeli. In the same year he served as a delegate to the International Monetary Conference in Paris and also as a juror at the Paris Universal Exhibition, an experience which equipped him to become a royal commissioner for the Paris exhibitions of 1878 and 1900. In 1868 he served as secretary to the royal commission appointed to examine the question of an international coinage. In 1869 he prepared, together with his best friend, Charles W. Fremantle (1834&#150;1914), a joint report on the Royal Mint. That report, which was accepted by the Treasury and embodied in the <span class="roman">Coinage Act</span> of 1870, launched both its authors upon their lifetime careers. In April 1873 Wilson was appointed by Lowe as comptroller-general of the national debt, a post from which he was subsequently seconded to Egypt.<h2>
<a name="TheSuezCanalCompany"></a>The Suez Canal Company</h2>Disraeli's purchase in 1875 of the Egyptian khedive's shares in the Suez Canal Company and his dispatch of Sir Stephen Cave to Egypt ushered in an Anglo-French duel for the control of that country which lasted for thirty years. In March 1876 Wilson was sent to Cairo as prospective minister of finance to the khedive Isma&#145;il, in a bid to frustrate French efforts to extend their own financial influence. Wilson was granted leave of absence from his post for a full six months but was denied any authority to commit the British government, because Derby had curbed Disraeli's enthusiasm. Under Isma&#145;il, a veritable &#145;Egyptian Louis XIV&#146;  (Sch&ouml;lch, 308), Egypt had prospered and benefited enormously from the boom induced by the American Civil War. The cultivated area had been expanded by one-sixth; the production of cotton and sugar had increased; exports had soared, and the revenues of the state had swelled by 73 per cent. The extension of sugar cultivation in Upper Egypt encouraged Isma&#145;il to embark on the creation of a vast equatorial empire, christened Isma&#145;iliyyah by Samuel Baker in 1874, which extended 1300 miles south of Khartoum to the sources of the Nile in Lake Albert and Lake Victoria. During the twelve years 1863&#150;75 this expansionist policy had, however, added &pound;87 million to the khedive's foreign debts. Isma&#145;il delighted in playing off one potential lender against another, and he welcomed Wilson as a new participant in the great game of Egyptian finance. Wilson first discussed with him a scheme for the consolidation and management of the debt by a special branch of the administration which would include two Englishmen, but Isma&#145;il wanted only a new loan. Disraeli declined to guarantee such a proposal, which both Rothschilds and Barings therefore refused to entertain. After Isma&#145;il was declared bankrupt (on 8 April 1876) in the wake of Cave's report, Derby flatly opposed the suggestion that Isma&#145;il be pressed to appoint Wilson as his financial agent. The khedive then adopted on 2 May a French scheme for the consolidation of the debt, under the management of four foreign commissioners, and Wilson returned to London. His mission might have appeared fruitless, but it nevertheless proved to be a turning point in his career; he had now established a connection with Egypt which was to last for thirty years. In 1876 he was appointed one of three government directors on the board of the Suez Canal Company, and he became a leading adviser to the British government on Egyptian finance. By 1878 he had expanded his role to include the drafting of diplomatic notes on Egypt.<h2>
<a name="MinisteroffinanceinEgypt18781879"></a>Minister of finance in Egypt, 1878&#150;1879</h2>After the collapse of the Goschen&#150;Joubert plan of 18 November 1876, which had provided for dual Anglo-French control over Egyptian finances, Wilson on 4 February 1878 recommended to the Foreign Office a new inquiry into Egypt's finances. Derby accepted the proposal and insisted that Wilson should serve as <i>de facto</i> president of the proposed seven-person commission of inquiry; Isma&#145;il also agreed, after some months of resistance. Wilson then spent more than four months in Egypt, from the appointment of the commission in April 1878, and soon came into bitter conflict with Isma&#145;il. Coming under the influence of Nubar Nubarian (1825&#150;1899), an Armenian pasha, Wilson decided to transform the commission into a court wherein Isma&#145;il would be put on trial and found lacking in financial probity. He wished to deny the khedive not merely the privilege of repudiating his debts when they proved too onerous, but even that of reducing the interest thereon to a tolerable level. The immediate cause of conflict lay in his enquiries into the private estates of the ruler. Isma&#145;il sought to win Wilson over by offering him the ministry of finance, but Wilson refused and began to favour the deposition of the khedive. His policy was supported by the British government in the expansionist fervour generated by the Russo-Turkish conflict. Disraeli's aspirations to establish a second India in the Levant, which had precipitated the resignation of Derby and his replacement on 27 March 1878 by Salisbury, envisaged the appointment of military proconsuls in Anatolia, the acquisition of a &#145;new Gibraltar&#146; in Cyprus, and the establishment of an English chancellor of the exchequer in Egypt in the cabinet of a Christian prime minister. The key agents were to be Nubar and Wilson, each of whom insisted to the khedive upon the appointment of the other to the reformed ministry envisaged by the commission. Isma&#145;il capitulated after six months, being mollified by the promise of a new loan, and promised both to surrender his estates and to accept the report of the commission of inquiry, which embodied Nubar's plans of reform.<br>
<br>The new ministry was appointed on 28 August 1878, with Nubar as prime minister and Wilson as minister of finance. After much hesitation the British government granted Wilson leave of absence for two and one-third years, and against all precedent, did not require him to resign his office in Britain. His immediate task was to secure a loan from Rothschilds on the security of the khedival estates. This was not sanctioned until 31 October, as Wilson had been ordered, to his chagrin and surprise, to give France an absolutely equal share in all financial appointments. A corollary to the loan was an Anglo-French agreement stipulating that the two European ministers would remain irremovable without the consent of their respective governments. Wilson was forced to pay out in fees 29 per cent of the &pound;8.5 million loan. He then returned to Egypt, to an empty treasury and a declining revenue. His salary was fixed at &pound;E6000, or double that of Nubar, who flattered him that he would become &#145;virtually Prime Minister&#146;  (Wilson, 153). Indeed Wilson's nominal powers far exceeded those of an English chancellor of the exchequer. The new ministry, which also included the Frenchman Ernest Gabriel de Bligni&egrave;res (1834&#150;1900) as minister of works, hoped to reconstruct the financial administration from top to bottom on the principles of probity and sound economics. In particular the ministers wished to make the full service of the foreign debt feasible. However, the hopes thus raised among foreign bondholders were doomed to disappointment&#151;the trio of ministers were alien to each other, independent of each other, and responsible to different powers; none was fluent in Arabic and all three were Christians, assigned to administer a predominantly Muslim society in which the demand of &#145;Egypt for the Egyptians&#146; had first surfaced during the year 1877. Moreover, the economic depression of 1877&#150;8 in Europe and competition from beet sugar suppliers in foreign markets had led to a decline in exports of both raw cotton and sugar, causing Egyptian state revenues to sink by one-fifth during 1878. The ministry also lacked the support of the Turco-Circassian &eacute;lite, the Egyptian notables, and, above all, the khedive himself.<br>
<br>Isma&#145;il began to undermine the new ministry within two months of the Rothschild loan, payment of which was held up by difficulties in establishing clear title to the khedival estates. As agents Isma&#145;il employed first the chamber of notables and later the army. The assembled notables expressed on 3 February 1879 their vehement opposition to the new ministers and to Wilson and de Bligni&egrave;res in particular. The ministry's measures of reform were wide-ranging, ill-considered, and impossible to implement. They included a codification and revision of all laws and ordinances in the administrative and financial spheres (a reform interpreted as one undertaken by Europeans for Europeans), a new land survey (a project interpreted as a prelude to higher land taxes), and the appointment of European inspectors, in order to control the collection of provincial revenues. Wilson twice declined to appear in person before the chamber and contemptuously delayed meeting a delegation in his own offices. He authorized the collection of taxes in advance of the harvest, in total disregard of his own avowed principles, of the objections of Nubar, and of the ravages of famine in Upper Egypt. Measures of retrenchment proved to be ill-advised in the extreme. The retirement of 1616 officers on half pay was intended to deprive the khedive of any military power for possible use against the ministry, but it plunged the whole army into a state of disaffection. Wilson not only refused to meet the just demands of the officers for their large arrears of pay but also denied the existence of any dissatisfaction within the army. Events on the next day, 18 February, proved him to be wrong. Some 500 officers gave public vent to their grievances and handled Nubar and Wilson very roughly, while carefully abstaining from any assault upon the Egyptian minister of war. The officers and Isma&#145;il emerged victorious, proving that &#145;two pairs of arms are not much use against two thousand&#146;  (A. Newton, <span class="italic">Lord Lyons: a Record of British Diplomacy</span>, 1913, 2.188). Nubar resigned office on the very next day, so rendering the position of Wilson and de Bligni&egrave;res highly precarious.<br>
<br>In desperation Wilson pressed for the reinstatement of Nubar and strongly opposed the appointment of Tawfiq as his successor, in an ill-considered bid to reduce Isma&#145;il to a political nullity. However, Wilson had lost the support of the British government and was accused, in parliament on 13 March, of acting as the covert servant of French financial interests. Disraeli, having moderated his original enthusiasm for expansion in the Levant, explained to the queen that her government had always studiously disclaimed any pretence that Wilson was acting as its agent. On 18 March Wilson submitted a proposal for a declaration of insolvency by Egypt, in an abject confession of personal failure. The chamber of notables rejected the suggestion as dishonourable and petitioned the khedive for Wilson's dismissal. Isma&#145;il developed his own counter-plan for a reduction of the interest rate on the unified debt from 7 to 5 per cent. He dismissed Wilson ignominiously from office on 7 April and was congratulated from Constantinople for ending the veiled occupation of Egypt. Wilson, however, declined to accept dismissal from &#145;that little scoundrel, the Khedive&#146;  (Blunt, 48). First he sought to persuade Rothschilds to pay Isma&#145;il the balance of his loan, in the hope of securing his own reinstatement in office; next he refused to go without the permission of the British government. Northcote then ordered him to return to London, but Wilson left Alexandria on 6 May and went straight to Paris, where he recruited Rothschilds to the cause of intervention. The immediate efforts of the firm in Paris and London proving unproductive, Rothschilds apparently turned to Bismarck, who initiated the process leading to the deposition of Isma&#145;il by the sultan on 26 June. Thereafter, Wilson boasted that through Rothschilds &#145;he had had his full revenge&#146;  (Blunt, 65) and that he had even been consulted on the choice of successor to Isma&#145;il.<h2>
<a name="AdviseronEgypt18801885"></a>Adviser on Egypt, 1880&#150;1885</h2>In 1880 Wilson was knighted and decorated by the sultan, and his hopes for reinstatement to ministerial office in Cairo were encouraged by his appointment as president of the commission of liquidation. In 1881 he served as a commissioner for the negotiation of a revised Anglo-French treaty of commerce, which was never concluded. Then he spent six weeks in drafting the Dilke&#150;Gambetta note of 8 January 1882, which was interpreted in Egypt as an unprovoked threat and which effectively weakened the position of the new khedive instead of strengthening it. In cabinet on 25 January 1882 Wilson was cited as an authority on Egypt whose flat denial of the existence of &#145;any real national feeling in the uprising&#146;  (D. W. R. Bahlman, <span class="italic">Diary of Sir Edward Walter Hamilton</span>, 1972, 1.214, 219) could be trusted. Thereafter &#145;the sudden and complete collapse of the so-called National Party&#146; was deemed to have proven his analysis correct  (ibid., 1.342). A year later, according to Gladstone, he remained &#145;so to speak, in Cabinet&#146; for Egyptian financial matters  (A. Ramm, <span class="italic">The Political Correspondence of Gladstone and Lord Granville</span>, 1962, 2.5), and seemed to be at the very zenith of his fortunes. Thereafter, however, he proved singularly ill-suited to his role as an official director simply because of his irredeemable subservience to French interests and his utter ignorance of the needs of the British clients of the Suez Canal Company. The three British directors had wholly succumbed to the influence of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the former French diplomat who had been the main force in the building of the Suez Canal. They refused to entertain the just claims of British shipowners, and advised the government that no more concessions could be obtained from the company. On 10 July 1883 an agreement was signed with the company by Sir John Stokes and Wilson on behalf of the British government: it provided for no increase in the number of British directors, and was immediately and universally condemned by the mercantile community in whose interest it ostensibly had been made. On 23 July Gladstone announced, without discussion, the withdrawal of the agreement. Four months later the &#145;London programme&#146; was agreed, on 30 November 1883, between the company and the Association of Steamship Owners Trading to the East, after four days of negotiations from which the British directors were excluded. This altered the balance of power between British interests and the company and between the three official directors and the seven new non-official directors appointed under its provisions. Only with reluctance did a new advisory committee of British directors in London admit the three official directors, on the recommendation of the foreign secretary.<br>
<br>In 1884 Wilson's hopes were raised anew by the appointment of Nubar as prime minister of Egypt and by his own contribution to a report on the financial situation in Egypt. That report paved the way for the enactment of the law of liquidation in 1885, after which Wilson's official connection with Egypt ended. In 1885 he served as the junior delegate to the International Commission on the Free Navigation of the Suez Canal, which met in Paris. In 1891 he served as a member of the interdepartmental committee of five meeting at the Foreign Office to consider the safety regulations for the new tanker traffic through the canal which were adopted in 1892. There he gave full support to Marcus Samuel for the employment of Shell tankers <i>en route</i> for the markets of Asia, in a modest contribution to the expansion of British trade. In 1892 he was appointed an official commissioner to the International Monetary Congress meeting in Brussels. There he expressed on behalf of the government uncompromising opposition to the adoption of a bimetallic standard of currency and affirmed instead its faith in monometallism  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Dec 1892, 51).<h2>
<a name="Comptrollerofthenationaldebtandcompanydirector"></a>Comptroller of the national debt and company director</h2>Wilson's greatest achievements may have been as comptroller-general of the national debt (1873&#150;94). He served eight different chancellors of the exchequer during a golden age of public finance, during which the influence of Gladstone remained predominant and the national debt was in decline. During his period in office the aggregate gross liabilities of the state were reduced by 14 per cent, the amount of funded debt by 19 per cent, the charge upon the funded debt by 26 per cent, total debt charges by 13 per cent, and the average total debt per capita by 29 per cent. Above all, the ratio of the debt to the gross national capital was reduced by a massive 35 per cent as the wealth of the nation increased. The comptroller's original task of managing the &#145;sinking fund&#146; was inevitably extended to embrace the administration of a whole range of trustee funds so that the National Debt Office came, in effect, to operate a vast banking business. Wilson became one of the most diligent superintendents in the history of the department, earning the trust and confidence of Gladstone, who defended him against the repeated criticism of MPs. Like Fremantle at the mint, Wilson sought to enlighten both parliament and the people about the mysteries of public finance by the preparation of an immense number of returns and statements of account. In 1887 he published his first historical survey, covering the aggregate gross liabilities of the state for the previous thirty years. Next, in 1891, he published a statistical history, in 329 pages, of the national debt from the creation of the sinking fund by Pitt, in 1786, to 31 March 1890. The latter greatly impressed Gladstone and has proved an invaluable source for historians.<br>
<br>Wilson's second career, as a company director, had begun in 1876 with the directorship of the Suez Canal Company. It entered a new phase in 1880, when he became a director of the Alliance Assurance Company Ltd, which his own grandfather had helped to found in 1824. Wilson also became, very briefly together with Robert Lowe, Viscount Sherbrooke, the trustee of a speculative American railway undertaking, in flat contravention of the salutary Treasury rule prohibiting government officials from holding any such office  (<span class="italic">The Economist</span>, 40, 11 Nov 1882, 1401). Wilson resigned from office as comptroller-general in 1894 and as a government director of the Suez Canal Company in 1896, four years after questions had been asked in the Commons about his directors' fees. In 1895 he had been created a GCMG, and he also became president of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada (at a salary of &pound;4000 for the part-time post) and made its London office into his new business address. He recruited as a new general manager Charles M. Hays (1856&#150;1912), who undertook a strenuous but effective reorganization of the railroad on the American model. Wilson made no attempt to reduce the heavily &#145;watered&#146; capital of the company but succeeded in raising the market value of its securities substantially. He also resumed payment of interest between 1898 and 1900 on three tranches of the company's stock, but did not generate enough income to pay a single cent in dividend on the ordinary shares. In 1903 Wilson launched the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway as an ancillary for the construction of the western half of a new transcontinental railway, which was also to build and operate a trans-Pacific steamship line to China and Japan. He nearly ruined the chances of securing government support by his supercilious attitude towards the founders of an indigenous rival, the Canadian Northern Railway, and he seriously underestimated the construction costs. Nevertheless, he raised &pound;16 million of new capital at 4 per cent, including &pound;13.2 million for the new 1200 mile line, &pound;5.2 million of which was secured through Rothschilds in 1905 and 1909. In 1903, at the height of his business career, Wilson was chairman of five companies and a director of three others. Notably, he chaired the British Electric Traction Company (1896), and the Egyptian Syndicate Ltd (1898&#150;1903).<br>
<br>On 9 November 1895 Wilson married his second wife, Beatrice Violet Mary Mostyn (1862&#150;1925), sister of the seventh Baron Vaux of Harrowden. They had no children. Wilson retired at the age of seventy-eight, in 1909, on a pension of &pound;1500. Two years after the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was completed to Port Rupert, Wilson died, on 9 February 1916, at 9 Berkeley Square, Mayfair, London; he had latterly resided at Foxhills, Chertsey, Surrey. He was cremated at Golders Green in London and buried near by at Kensal Green on 12 February 1916. By contemporaries, he was noted for his geniality towards his peers but also for his arrogance towards opponents. He loved animals (especially bulldogs), fine art, and French civilization. His posthumous reputation has proved to be somewhat chequered: the editor of his autobiography, written in 1914&#150;15 at the request of his widow, believed that &#145;his name will be indelibly connected with modern Egyptian history&#146;  (Wilson, v), but no modern dictionary of Egyptian history even mentions him. In Canada his name was bestowed in 1907 upon the new city of Rivers, sited to the north-west of Brandon in south-west Manitoba, though later his reputation in the dominion was marred by the memory of his ignorance of local conditions and his lack of tact in negotiations. His own statistical history of the national debt remains a permanent achievement, however, and it has been made available to a wider public, in summary form, through Dr B. R. Mitchell's <span class="italic">Abstract of British Historical Statistics</span> (1962, 1988).<br>
