<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whately,  Richard</span>  (1787&#150;1863), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin and philosopher</span>, was born on 1 February 1787, at Cavendish Square, London, the youngest of nine children of the Revd Canon Joseph Whately (<i>d</i>. 1797) of Nonsuch Park, Surrey, and his wife, Jane Plumer. It was a well-connected political and professional family of some distinction: his paternal uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29177/', "Thomas Whately (1726&#150;1772)")</script> had been George Grenville's private secretary and subsequently secretary to the Treasury in Grenville's administration, attaching himself after Grenville's death to Lord North. Richard Whately's maternal uncle, William Plumer (1736&#150;1822), the MP for Hertfordshire, in whose house he had been born, was a wealthy, dedicated Foxite, who had been preceded as a whig MP by his father, William Plumer (1687&#150;1767). The gentlemanly professions were equally well represented in the family: another paternal uncle had been a banker, and Whately's brother William became a lawyer; his brother Thomas, the poor-law reformer, was an Anglican clergyman.<h2>
<a name="EarlyeducationandOxford"></a>Early education and Oxford</h2>Whately was six years younger than his nearest sibling, an isolated child, slight in build, timid, and retiring in manner. He had few companions, but compensated for this by learning to read and write very early and going on nature rambles. A prodigy at mental arithmetic, he lived in an imaginative world of his own construction: &#145;I was engaged either in calculation or castle-building&#146; he later commented  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 1.5). At the age of nine years he was sent to a private school near Bristol with strong West Indian connections run by a Mr Philips. Although he was there drawn out of himself, and grew up tall and strong (looking, it has been said, like a Yorkshire ostler), his school life was not particularly happy: he still went on solitary rambles, observing natural history, and continued his habit of &#145;visionary speculations&#146;  (ibid., 6.6). He became a first-rate shot and fisherman. However, he did lose both his passion and ability for mental arithmetic, which he now learned with difficulty and slowly.<br>
<br>Whately entered Oriel College in 1805, graduating BA (double second class) in 1808 and proceeding MA in 1812. In 1810 he won the English essay prize and in 1811 was elected a fellow of the college. He then settled at Oxford as a private tutor, in which capacity he taught Nassau Senior, the economist, and Samuel Hinds, later bishop of Norwich, who had also attended Philips's school near Bristol. He became a dedicated, if unconventional, teacher (he taught lying on a sofa with one leg over the back), taking particular delight in encouraging diffident characters. He disregarded Oxford conventions: in the early morning he could be seen walking Christ Church meadows, not wearing a cap and gown as required, but a white hat and coat (he was known as the White Bear), accompanied by his white dog which he had trained to climb trees and from there jump into the water. However, his rough-and-ready manners (he once shocked Henry Bathurst, bishop of Norwich, by receiving him with his feet on the table) and eccentricities (he kept herrings in his college rooms to grill on his fire for breakfast) meant that he was never popular. His friendships, which he particularly cherished, were largely confined to the society of Oriel: in addition to Senior and Hinds, he cultivated Edward Hawkins, Thomas Arnold, and (until a few months before his death in 1860) Baden Powell.<h2>
<a name="WhatelyandearlyNoeticism"></a>Whately and early Noeticism</h2>Whately had regarded his tutor at Oriel as &#145;utterly incompetent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Remains</span>, 149). The turning point in his intellectual career had been the lectures of Edward Copleston, whose intellectual disciple he became and whose views, in the early phase of his career, he was happy to represent and publicly acknowledge: two of his early works&#151;the <span class="italic">Bampton Lectures</span> (1822) and <span class="italic">Elements of Logic</span> (1826)&#151;were expressly dedicated to Copleston. Copleston became godfather to Whately's daughter and in later life Whately edited Copleston's <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1854).<br>
<br>Copleston was the founder of the Noetic school of Anglican apologetics at Oxford, a group of scholars who sought to provide a defence of Christianity on the ground of its reasonableness against the onslaught of deists and Unitarians. The <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45620', "Noetics")</script> also attempted to shore up Anglicanism by ensuring that the ancient universities were educationally capable of producing clergymen competent of defending the Church of England against such intellectual assaults. In the 1810s and early 1820s their approach was seen as a worthy bulwark of the Church of England, and not, as it was to be seen later, by the Tractarians in particular, as the first stage in the dilution of Anglicanism by secularism.<br>
<br>In this sense Whately, spreading the Coplestonian message, operated, if not within the pale, then certainly as an intellectually acceptable ally, of the high-church tradition. Thus he shared with the &#145;high and dry&#146; Henry John Rose a loathing of German theology and philosophy. He looked down upon the evangelicals of St Edmund Hall, while dismissing eighteenth-century latitudinarianism as &#145;spurious liberality of sentiment&#146;  (R. Whately, <span class="italic">The Use and Abuse of Party Feeling</span>, 1822, 220). With more irony than accuracy, he described himself as a &#145;divine right tory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Remains</span>, 64) on account of his belief in obedience to the secular state, so long as a legal order existed, and his rejection of social contract theory as the basis of politics. (In fact he was an uncontroversial supporter of the revolution of 1688.) Above all, in his early theology, which was praised by the high-church <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, he sought to demonstrate the truth of Christian evidences (as opposed to natural theology), and to do so not by dogmatic assertion but by the use of modern tools of academic discourse.<br>
<br>Whately's first substantial essay, <span class="italic">Historic Doubts Relative to Napoleon Buonaparte</span> (1819), was a characteristic production with regard to both intellectual purpose and author. It was a bold, ironic attack on Hume's essay on miracles, in which he sought to weigh the evidence for the existence and exploits of Napoleon in order to demonstrate that proof of the existence of the exceptional can only ever amount to a probability, relying as it does on testimony and not experience. But, he argued, if it were accepted that Napoleon existed, in the absence of any prejudice against religion, there was equally no reason to doubt that Christ had performed the miracles recorded in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. It was intended as a <i>bouleversement</i> of the rationalist sceptic position, using Hume's method against himself. It was a popular success, demonstrating a capacity for satire (it included a history of Napoleon in parody of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>) which in later life he sought to curb.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Historic Doubts</span> owed something to William Paley and the eighteenth-century bishop of Durham Joseph Butler in its insistence that there was no improbability that testimony could not outweigh. But of the two, Whately's greater debt (as was the Noetics') was to Butler. In part 2 of his famous <span class="italic">Analogy</span>, Butler had indicated that the difficulties involved in written revelation were similar to those found in experience. Acknowledging this insight, the Noetics sought to develop an inductive theology to study the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, just as induction was the basis of the study of the natural world: in the same way that the world of nature was a world of facts, so revelation consisted of scriptural &#145;facts&#146;. In this enterprise Whately was a leading participant, albeit that this participation was not systematic. Like his mentor, Copleston, Whately's writings tended to be occasional pieces, written for an ephemeral purpose, rather than learned monographs. &#145;A great work is a thing I have never undertaken&#146;, he once wrote  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 2.173), attributing this on another occasion to a natural indolence which he attempted to overcome. He was partially successful: he was infinitely more prolific than Copleston, but never as academic as his friend and fellow Noetic Renn Dickson Hampden.<br>
<br>The study of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as a collection of facts required that their nature be identified. Whately understood this to be limited. As he explained in his earliest theological essays (his 1921 edition of Archbishop William King's <span class="italic">Discourse on Predestination</span> and the <span class="italic">Essays on some of the Peculiarities of the Christian Religion</span>, published in 1825, which for the main part was a collection of sermons delivered at Oxford in 1820), the purpose of the scriptures was to teach man the way to eternal happiness, and not to teach him the nature or essential qualities of things as they are in themselves. But therein also lay their superiority, for they taught lessons that were not discernible by the exercise of man's reason. They were the product of divine revelation.<br>
<br>From this understanding of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> four conclusions flowed. The first was that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> did not seek to teach all truth: it was not intended as a substitute for natural philosophy. For example, the biblical account of creation was not a geological theory, but simply served the purpose of informing its readers that God created the world. This was scarcely a new approach to biblical study, even within the Anglican church. It had been advocated, for example, by John Hey, the Cambridge theologian, at the beginning of the century (Oriel College Library had purchased a new copy of Hey's Norrissian lectures in the early 1820s on Pusey's recommendation). Second, the <span class="roman">Bible</span> taught by analogy. In describing divine qualities in human terms it did not ascribe human qualities to God. Indeed, one of the principal purposes in republishing King's <span class="italic">Discourse</span> was to bring to public attention an earlier description of man's analogical understanding of God that had been praised by Copleston in his own <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Doctrines of Necessity and Predestination</span> (1821). Third, the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was written so as to produce practical results, and was thus couched in historically relative terms. It was therefore best understood by being acquainted with the historical circumstances, habitual modes of thought, and understanding of the persons who constituted its first audience. Fourth, because scriptural revelation consisted in the teaching of necessary facts, it was not possible to go beyond the realm of facts even where they appeared to be contradictory. That they appeared contradictory did not render them any less &#145;factual&#146;: as Butler taught, many apparently contradictory matters existed in nature and the same difficulties were to be expected in scripture as in nature, since both were collections of facts.<br>
<br>This understanding of the limited, but factual, nature of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was used by Whately for orthodox ends: to attack sceptics, rationalist Unitarians, and Calvinist evangelicals. Thus natural theologians were dismissed on the ground of the superiority of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. According to Whately, &#145;the study of natural religion ought properly to <i>follow</i>, or at least to accompany, and not to precede, that of revelation&#146;  (R. Whately, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, 1825, x&#150;xi). The doctrine of the immortality of the soul, for example, could be discovered only from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Likewise St Paul was not a Calvinist, but an orthodox Anglican. Whately demonstrated this in his <span class="italic">Essays on some of the Difficulties of the Writings of St Paul</span> (1828) in which, for example, in relation to the doctrine of election, he argued that its true meaning was to be ascertained by reference to the <span class="roman">Old Testament's</span> notion of divine election from which it could be seen that election was conditional on being a faithful follower of the church. Thus he sought to ensure that St Paul's writings were regarded as &#145;a principal bulwark of the Gospel&#146;  (ibid., 46&#150;7) and censured their comparative neglect.<br>
<br>In 1820 Whately met Elizabeth Pope (<i>d</i>. 1860), the cousin of his Oriel friend Sherlock Willis and the third daughter of William Pope of Hillingdon Hall, Uxbridge; on 18 July 1821 they were married at Cheltenham, &#145;for love&#146;, as he recorded in his commonplace book. They were to have four daughters and a son. The second of their daughters was the missionary and teacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59107/', "Mary Louisa Whately")</script>. Marriage necessitated his leaving his Oriel fellowship, and in August 1822 his uncle presented him to the living of Halesworth in Suffolk. He was resident there for less than three years owing to his wife's illness. None the less, he founded an adult school and weekly lecture, and was active in his local poor-law union. He advocated the abolition of relief for the able-bodied poor unless they were employed by parish officers on work of a public nature. This was as much on account of the demoralization that idleness brings as the &#145;vice&#146; of indolence. In so doing he also identified a &#145;benefits trap&#146;: a labourer had little incentive to seek employment if local wages were no more than the level of local relief. By taking themselves out of the pool of available labour, such persons also kept local wages artificially high in relation to supply.<br>
<br>Whately was summoned back to Oxford in 1825 on his appointment by Lord Grenville, chancellor of Oxford University, as principal of St Alban Hall. This patronage had been secured by Copleston, as part of his design to elevate and improve Oxford teaching. St Alban was one of two halls of residence (the other being St Mary's) that Copleston wished Oriel to acquire: he was successful in neither objective, though Oriel did subsume St Mary Hall in 1902. However, he did succeed in bringing both under Noetic influence (Hampden became principal of St Mary's in 1833). Like St Mary's, St Alban Hall had a low academic reputation; it was known as the &#145;Botany Bay&#146; of the university. Whately changed this, with the assistance, as vice-principal, first of John Henry Newman&#151;then a Noetic prot&eacute;g&eacute;&#151;and from 1827 of his former pupil Hinds.<br>
<br>Whately's concern for Christianity as a reasonable religion led him to ensure that Anglicans were versed in the right methods of reasoning not only through his teaching but also his publications. His most notable achievement in this regard was his textbook <span class="italic">Elements of Logic</span>, which had first appeared in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span> (1826). It was written at the suggestion of Copleston and with the assistance of Newman and Nassau Senior. Indeed, as early as 1822 Newman had constructed a rough draft of the article after copying out various Whately manuscripts on logic, and this formed the basis of the work. Its production was typical of the collaborative enterprises in which the Noetics indulged. It is most famous in retrospect as a work of meta-logic&#151;that is, for its distinction between induction as the process of collecting or investigating facts, which was not a process of reasoning, and induction as the right method of inference from the facts collected. This was the deductive method, its tool was the syllogism and its greatest exponent was Aristotle. But the <span class="italic">Logic</span> was more than a textbook which dominated reading lists for twenty years until replaced by John Stuart Mill's <span class="italic">System of Logic</span>. It was also intended as a polemic in two senses. First, it was to promote sound reasoning to counteract religious scepticism. &#145;The adversaries of our Faith&#146;, Whately wrote, &#145;would, I am convinced, have been &hellip; more satisfactorily answered &hellip; had a thorough acquaintance with logic been more common than it is&#146;  (R. Whately, <span class="italic">Elements of Logic</span>, 1827, xxviii). Second, it was to serve as an agent of university reform. Whately argued that logic should be made compulsory for candidates at Oxford for academical honours: to this end his preface was separately reprinted and circulated. In the same genre was Whately's less successful, but equally widely circulated, manual <span class="italic">Elements of Rhetoric</span> (1828), the purpose of which was to describe &#145;the process of <i>conveying truth</i> to others, by reasoning&#146;  (R. Whately, <span class="italic">Elements of Rhetoric</span>, 1828, 23).<br>
<br>Although Whately's Christianity was a religion of reason resting on evidence (thus the fault of evangelicalism and Roman Catholicism was that they were anti-intellectual, the former believing sincerity was enough, the latter sacrificing independent judgement to tradition), it was not dry and rationalist. He was a firm advocate of zeal for the gospel, and he believed that creeds were a necessary component of a church: the laying aside of formularies would be tantamount to putting an end to the society. He was a supporter of foreign missionary work and established the first Irish branch of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. But he cautioned against partisan zealotry that distorted truth and led to heresy. Indeed, for Whately heresies were the product of false reasoning allied to distorting passions, the product of a common human nature rather than a quality peculiar to heretics. This was the burden of his <span class="italic">Bampton Lectures</span> in 1822 and of his later work, dedicated to the former Catholic priest Joseph Blanco White, <span class="italic">The Errors of Romanism Traced to their Origin in Human Nature</span> (1830). Whately held that Wesleyanism was the product of ambition, while Unitarianism was attributable to a love of novelty, and many Calvinists were motivated by an undue love of disputation. He advocated toleration of dissenting views on the ground that their true meaning might be misunderstood by orthodox protestants, or that they might be the product of a lack of education or the seeking of truths from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> that it was incapable of supplying. But he valued the Church of England over other churches because it asserted the primacy of the scriptures, which contained God's full and final revelation.<br>
<br>By the mid-1820s Whately had become the Noetics' leading light and it had become the dominant intellectual movement at Oxford. In 1830 a journalist on <span class="italic">John Bull</span> could salute him as the intellectual leader of Oriel and could refer (wrongly) to Thomas Arnold as Whately's &#145;bottle holder&#146;. Copleston had become increasingly involved in political affairs outside Oxford and in 1828 left Oxford altogether, having become bishop of Llandaff in 1827; his successor, Edward Hawkins, was never able to match Whately in intellectual verve or dominance. Meanwhile, a number of Whately's friends succeeded to various Oxford appointments and were thus physically within his sphere of influence: in 1825 Senior became the first Drummond professor of political economy; in 1827 Hinds returned to Oxford as Whately's vice-principal at St Alban Hall; and, in the same year, Baden Powell returned as Savilian professor of geometry. In 1826 Blanco White came to reside at Oxford and obtained common-room rights at Oriel, and in 1829 Whately's former pupil Hampden was appointed to the board of examiners and came to live at Oxford. This was also the year that the Noetics sought a metropolitan voice: Senior and Whately founded the <span class="italic">London Review</span>, with Blanco White as editor. It was intended as a (short-lived) protest against the sectarian temper of its rivals: the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>, <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span>, and <span class="italic">Westminster</span> reviews. It folded after only two issues, a premonition of what was to follow, partly because of its academic tone, partly because even the literate classes wanted sectarianism.<h2>
<a name="WhatelyandlateNoeticism"></a>Whately and late Noeticism</h2>The second half of the 1820s heralded a time of major political change. As the threat of the French Revolution receded, there was increasing clamour for national institutions to be reformed to reflect the growth of dissenting populations in the towns and the strength of the Catholic population in Ireland, which since 1801 had formed part of the Union. Such reform became increasingly likely when, in 1827, the liberal tory George Canning became prime minister. Thus in 1828 the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> were repealed and in 1829 Catholic emancipation was achieved. Whately supported both measures. The reform of national political institutions prompted a reconsideration of the role of the Anglican church and Anglican institutions, including the ancient universities, and the emergence of church parties. Indeed, it was Catholic emancipation and the re-election of Sir Robert Peel as MP for Oxford University that precipitated the symbolic split of Newman from Whately. It is in this context that the second phase of Whately's career has to be understood. In the political context of the late 1820s and 1830s his stance on the political questions of the day became increasingly to be associated with whiggery. Although the substantive analysis changed little, and Whately remained loyal to Copleston's Noetic upbringing, the second-order reforms which he advocated placed him firmly on the side of political liberalism even if, by intellectual background, he stood outside the traditional whiggery of the Fox&#150;Holland&#150;Grey school.<br>
<br>In his anonymously published <span class="italic">Letters on the Church by an Episcopalian</span> (1826), Whately attacked the whig Warburtonian alliance between church and state on the ground that, since Christ's kingdom was not of this world, the interference of the secular power in religious affairs was at variance with Christ's teaching. Indeed, it imparted to the church a coercive power which created the impression that religion was simply a state contrivance for maintaining order. Whately was therefore opposed to the church carrying out secular administrative functions such as maintaining registers of births, marriages, and deaths, and was equally opposed to the royal appointment of bishops, their participation in the House of Lords, and parliament's ultimate control over the Church of England's articles and liturgy. The separation of church and state, however, would not result in the church losing the right to its property, since this was not the state's property but the church's. For example, tithes were not a tax levied by government. None the less, the state did have a right to take away property whenever the inutility or harmfulness of the institution rendered its abolition important to the public welfare.<br>
<br>Whately argued that the church itself was not merely a voluntary organization of believers: it had as legitimate a claim to be acknowledged as of divine origin as did the Jewish theocracy. It had authority in matters of faith, including the authority to declare Christian doctrines and duties and to exclude members who did not conform. Thus, to disregard the authority of the church, in Whately's eyes, was to commit an offence against Christ himself. In this he followed the teaching of his fellow Noetic Hawkins. But this did not mean that what the church declared to be the faith was necessarily the true faith. Although the teaching of doctrine was an office that Christ had bestowed on the church, its lessons were subject to the higher authority of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In a conflict between church teaching and the scriptures, the scriptures were superior. Moreover, he asserted in later works, because the scriptures consisted simply of facts and were not mathematical propositions from which &#145;true&#146; equations could be deduced, creeds, liturgies, and catechisms (that is, the &#145;equations&#146;) were only the writings of able and pious men. This was the conclusion that his pupil Hampden was to illustrate with such controversy in the 1830s.<br>
<br>Although this view of church&#150;state relations influenced Newman, as he recorded in his <span class="italic">Apologia pro vita sua</span>, and thus the Tractarian high-church tradition, it was more than capable of a liberal interpretation. By contemplating the withdrawal of Anglicanism as a state church while allowing that, on limited public interest grounds, governments might interfere with the distribution of church property, Whately recognized the possibility of church reform. Whately never publicly supported disestablishment, but he did support measures which to his mind took the church out of politics. In particular, he became a lifelong advocate of the revival of convocation in exchange for parliament withdrawing its control over spiritual matters such as the prayer book. For a similar reason he advocated Jewish emancipation, since to grant Christians a monopoly of civil rights was a violation of the rule of &#145;rendering to Caesar the things that are Caesar's&#146;. Likewise, he could contemplate and support payment of Catholic priests out of the consolidated fund because this was not a protestant source of finance, but revenues contributed by both Catholics and protestants, to which the former also had a right to an equitable share. He also supported the grant to the Catholic Maynooth College and advocated the removal of religious tests of entry to national institutions, notably the ancient universities, other than the church itself. He himself succeeded in 1837 in abolishing the religious oath which the members of the Order of St Patrick had to swear.<br>
<br>In 1829 Whately succeeded his former pupil, Senior, as Drummond professor of political economy. This provided him with a further opportunity to Christianize secular teaching and ensure that this branch of knowledge remained in the hands of the advocates of &#145;social order&#146;. He seized upon the <span class="italic">Introductory Lectures</span> (1831) as a means of extending Paley's <span class="italic">Natural Theology</span> to the &#145;body politic&#146;. This willingness to engage with secularizing thought, unremarkable earlier in the century, now distinguished him from high-churchmen, who increasingly regarded such encounters as a form of contagion rather than inoculation. His strategy was twofold. His first objective was to limit the scope of the science of political economy in order to present it as a neutral professional discipline. Accordingly, his preferred name for the subject was the more technical &#145;catallactics&#146;, or the science of exchanges, since it was not a science of happiness: it could assist a statesman in the decisions he had to take, but was no substitute for them. For the same reason it did not trespass on scriptural territory: the <span class="roman">Bible</span> taught religious and moral truths which political economy did not purport to teach, and thus the two areas of instruction were mutually exclusive. Secondly, he sought to show that the study of political economy provided further evidence of &#145;a wise Providence&#146;. In his account, man emerged from a savage state characterized by indolence and want of forethought as a result of a miraculous revelation. The desire for wealth and emulation, combined with the division of labour (a principle derived from <span class="roman">Genesis</span>) and security of property, led to the advancement of civilization. As economic progress occurred, more would be released from mere mechanical toil and knowledge would advance. The division of labour need not lead to a debasement of the mind: it could be counteracted by education. The Malthusian evil of overpopulation, famine, and death would occur only in the absence of the exercise of human reason. In an age of &#145;dismal&#146; economics, Whately was an optimist.<br>
<br>This optimism was justified by Whately's scientific method, explained in his <span class="italic">Introductory Lectures</span>, which owed much to Dugald Stewart, the Scottish philosopher and heir to Adam Smith. According to Whately, a science required both a correct ascertainment of the data from which to reason and a correct process of deduction. Because sciences required induction, they were in principle not capable of the certainty that pure deductive reasoning brought; only mathematics was capable of such certainty. This was a further difference between scientific study and the study of the scriptures since scriptural fact was, by virtue of being revealed fact, necessarily true. No scientific fact, dependent on human and thus fallible observation, could possess that degree of certainty. However, political economy, unlike other sciences, depended on few facts and these were in the range of everyone's observation. This being so, assuming the correct deductive process was applied, the conclusions to be drawn from them were akin to mathematical propositions.<br>
<br>Whately, however, was not merely concerned with ensuring that members of the ruling &eacute;lite were not secularized by the new sciences. He also believed that educating the poor was a means of ensuring the continuity of the social order, and not&#151;as his more conservative contemporaries feared&#151;subverting it. In a sermon preached in aid of the national school at Halesworth in 1830, he argued that the desire for education among the poor was so great that it ought not to be left in the hands of anti-Christians. This accorded with the will of God in that as the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was intended for the poor as much as the rich, the poor could become acquainted with it only by learning to read. Whately held that public worship and the teaching of the clergy were insufficient, and he became a prolific popularizing author, writing and compiling school textbooks. In this context his two most famous works were his <span class="italic">Easy Lessons on Money Matters for the Use of Young People</span> (1833), a simplified version of his lectures on political economy, which was circulated by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, translated into many foreign languages (including Maori and Japanese), and was read by the young Stanley Jevons, and his <span class="italic">Introductory Lessons on Christian Evidences</span> (1838), which, when circulated in Irish national schools, was to become a focus of controversy.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofDublintheearlyyears"></a>Archbishop of Dublin: the early years</h2>In 1831 Earl Grey, the whig prime minister, offered Whately the archbishopric of Dublin, second in the Anglican hierarchy in Ireland to the archbishopric of Armagh (the former was lord primate of Ireland, whereas the latter was lord primate of all Ireland). It had first been offered to the whig bishop of Norwich, Henry Bathurst, who, at some eighty-seven years old, had declined it. Henry Brougham, the lord chancellor, then suggested either Thomas Arnold or Whately. Grey chose the latter, although he had never heard of him; it was rumoured that Grey had extracted a promise from Whately to support the government's proposed Irish national system of education, but this was not, in fact, the case. For his part Whately received the offer at breakfast while staying at Arnold's house at Rugby. He put it in his pocket without remark, walked the garden for an hour, and then told his family. Why he accepted it is a mystery.<br>
<br>Copleston believed it was from a sense of duty, as Whately regarded it as &#145;a call to the helm of a crazy ship in a storm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 1.110). It was a task for which he was unsuited: his brusque manner was capable of giving offence at a time when diplomacy was required; he had scarcely any pastoral experience; and he was not a partisan whig who could be relied upon to support the government in the Lords. Above all, doctrinally he was out of kilter with the Church of Ireland, then dominated by a high-church evangelicalism. As the author of a work advocating the separation of church and state and a leading exponent of the Noetic view that sabbatarianism rested not on scriptural authority but merely on the tradition of the church, Whately by 1831 had little in common with either high-churchmanship or evangelicalism. This was particularly unfortunate in Dublin, where his predecessor, William Magee, an evangelical, had been responsible for rekindling ecclesiastical conflict with the Catholics after a number of years of relative peace. Not surprisingly his appointment was greeted with dismay, and rumours circulated charging him with various heresies and secret membership of the Jesuits.<br>
<br>The most pressing problem facing the Church of Ireland in the 1830s was the refusal of the peasantry to pay tithes, which were then the chief income of the ordinary clergy. However, the most pressing problem facing the government as regards the Irish church was its wealth in relation to its size, which prompted Catholic outrage. In 1834 the Anglican population in Ireland was less than that of the diocese of Durham, but it was governed by four archbishops and twenty-two bishops and had notional revenues of some &pound;800,000, three-quarters of which came from tithes paid by more than 6 million Roman Catholics. Ending clergy distress and achieving church reform went hand in hand. Whately played his role in both, although he took the lead in neither.<br>
<br>As regards tithes, Whately first favoured commutation, but by 1836 he favoured their abolition and replacement by a rent-charge to be collected by the landlords. But this was a second-best option. He would have liked the government to purchase tithes for a capital sum which would have been administered by the Irish ecclesiastical commissioners. (As early as 1831 he wanted all church revenues to be administered by an ecclesiastical board.) The government was against such a proposal and Whately had to settle for the imperfect <span class="roman">Tithe Rent-Charge Act</span> of 1838. In the meantime, by way of alleviating the distress of the clergy, he worked closely with the parliamentary draftsmen on the 1833 <span class="roman">Million Act</span>, which provided &pound;1 million to be lent to the clergy in the absence of tithe payments; he himself gave the profits of several of his books to the relief of the clergy. Whately also took part in discussions with the government over the <span class="roman">Irish Church Temporalities Act</span> of 1834, which suppressed eight Irish bishoprics and established the Irish ecclesiastical commission, although the lead was taken by Archbishop Beresford of Armagh. He was one of only two bishops to be loyal to the primate at the time of the bishops' revolt in March 1833, following the introduction of the bill in February, and he spoke, to the whig government's pleasure, in favour of it in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Whately's principal public role, however, was as the only Irish episcopal supporter of the whig government's national system of education, by which government-financed grants were given to schools offering combined (that is, non-denominational) moral and literary instruction and separate religious instruction. (By contrast the archbishops of Armagh and Tuam and fifteen other bishops in 1832 had signed a petition against the scheme.) Whately, in the absence of the titular head of the board of commissioners, the duke of Leinster, invariably took the chair, and on the board formed an alliance with his Roman Catholic counterpart, Archbishop Daniel Murray, that extended beyond the education system. He refused, for example, to join the Royal Dublin Society because Archbishop Murray had been blackballed. In 1838 the education commissioners published Whately's <span class="italic">Lessons on the Truth of Christianity</span>, a modified edition of his <span class="italic">Introductory Lessons</span> published in England.<br>
<br>Whately also played his part in the Irish administration, acting as <i>ex officio</i> lord justice in the absence of the lord lieutenant. However, he was scathing about the Irish government: he wished to see the Irish Office abolished and the country run from London, since only London could guarantee meritocratic government and ensure that patronage was not abused. He was also in favour of the abolition of the lord lieutenancy: this personage, he held, had no duties &#145;but to preside at a mock court and make after-dinner speeches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 2.393). Consequently, the office was a cheap source of disaffection. Instead he wished to see the queen reside in Dublin for an annual period. Whately was a strong unionist, but less because he saw Ireland as an outpost of a Greater Britain than because he feared that repeal would lead to civil war: there would be a struggle between Catholics and protestants as the former sought to establish their ascendancy, followed by a struggle between the rich and the poor as the poor realized they would not be made any richer by repeal. Anarchy and mutual slaughter would ensue. Likewise, he was sufficiently clear-sighted to view the Church of Ireland less as a native church than a colonial church, similar to the Anglican communion in India.<br>
<br>The 1830s were the years of Whately's greatest political influence: he advised Lord Melbourne on ecclesiastical appointments and he was consulted by Lord Duncannon on Irish matters. In 1835 his threat to resign from the education board was instrumental in ensuring that its grant did not fluctuate with the fortunes of the Church of Ireland, but was paid out of the consolidated fund. However, his influence should not be exaggerated: following the controversy over the appointment in 1836 of Whately's friend Hampden to the regius chair of divinity at Oxford, Melbourne was deterred from appointing other of his nominees. Although he was appointed in 1833 to chair the royal commission on the Irish poor at the suggestion of his friend Senior, the government ditched its conclusions in support of substantial public works programmes to stimulate employment, opting instead for the (cheaper) introduction of the English workhouse system as recommended by George Nicholls, one of the English poor-law commissioners, after a brief visit to Ireland. This left Whately feeling somewhat bitter: he described Nicholls's consideration of the issues as no more than getting &#145;one bottle of water out of the Liffey and one out of the Shannon&#146;  (McDowell, 227). As a result, according to Lord Holland, he was averse to attending the House of Lords and was, &#145;some said a little lukewarm on any matter affecting the Ministry&#146;  (Kriegel, 359).<br>
<br>Whately remained equally singular in other matters. He did not court Irish popularity. He favoured the promotion of theological learning over evangelical enthusiasm: &#145;true Christianity is a very quiet and deliberate religion&#146; he wrote  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 2.379). He revived the rite of confirmation which had not been administered in his diocese for many years. He personally examined ordinands, not leaving the task to his chaplains. He sought to found a separate theological college for clerical education, a scheme which was finally blocked by the whig government in 1839. Although he was one of the founders of the Society for Protecting the Rights of Conscience in Ireland (1850), which provided financial support for former Catholics, he insisted he did not do so in order to encourage protestant converts but to give protection to those excluded from employment on religious grounds. Indeed, he controversially prevented the militant protestant evangelical Revd Tresham Gregg from preaching in Dublin in 1842. He preached against the evangelical beliefs that the cholera epidemic of 1832 and the Irish famine were divine judgments. This did not prevent him from opposing outdoor relief, though, whatever his public views, in private he gave about &pound;8000 in 1846&#150;9 for relief of the poor. His principal solution, however, was a well-organized and vigorous system of emigration and colonization: for him the Irish problem was excess population.<br>
<br>In intellectual matters Whately maintained his enthusiasms, but did not develop them: if new causes were espoused, this was principally because they reflected old concerns. He supported the (in his case gradual) abolition of the slave trade. In 1832 he founded the chair of political economy at Trinity College, Dublin; he was also a founder of the Dublin Statistical Society in 1847 and a decade later presided over the statistical section at the Dublin meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. His agitation against transportation (his influential 1832 pamphlet <span class="italic">Thoughts on Secondary Punishments</span> led in part to the House of Commons select committee inquiry) was founded on his belief that punishment and effective colonization were contradictory aims. Indeed he was an ardent penal reformer: although favouring the abolition of the death penalty, he also believed that prisoners should know the real meaning of their sentences and was thus a supporter of certain sentences being irremissible. He became an enthusiastic phrenologist: he had a cast of his head made at Oxford in 1831 and submitted it to three phrenologists in all. This was no doubt because he sympathized with, if he did not entirely endorse, George Combe's view of phrenology as the philosophy of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. It was another example of the compatibility of Christianity with the new sciences, and in particular a &#145;scientific&#146; demonstration of man's moral faculty, the existence of which Whately asserted in opposition to Paley's moral utilitarianism.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofDublinthelateryears"></a>Archbishop of Dublin: the later years</h2>As he himself would have been the first to admit, Whately's was not a profound mind: &#145;I know nothing thoroughly&#146;, he remarked in 1818  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Remains</span>, 54). His intellectual skill was in explaining the theoretical principles of subjects: logic, political economy, rhetoric, theology. &#145;Elementary studies are most to my taste&#146;, he declared, &#145;I resemble one whose trade is to make instruments for others to work with&#146;  (ibid., 55). He had little visual sense. If he did not read widely (though he much exaggerated his own lack of reading), neither did he read deeply. As his opportunities for reading declined outside Oxford, so did his appetite for it. He increasingly stuck to what he knew, tending to be dismissive of new developments. Of Chambers's <span class="italic">Vestiges of Creation</span> (1844), he wrote that he &#145;certainly thought it could be improved by being mended&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 2.275). He could not, and did not, read the philosopher of science William Whewell. By the mid-1840s he was, in George Combe's description, &#145;an old man, tall and thin, and is afflicted with some irritability of nervous fibre &hellip; it [is] impossible for him to sit still&#146;  (Gibbon, 1.271). Increasingly he spent his time at Redesdale, the house which he took outside Dublin, surrounded by his books and gardening (he was a keen experimenter in propagating new species). If he did not lose his sense of fun in private (one of his favourite pastimes was using a boomerang), in public he increasingly saw his task, as he noted in 1849, as combating the prevailing tendencies of the age.<br>
<br>The first of these was Tractarianism. When he left Oxford in 1831 Whately was still a supporter of Newman: he suggested him as his second choice to take over St Alban Hall. But the controversy over the <span class="roman">Irish Church Temporalities Act</span> of 1834, the admission of dissenters to Oxford (Whately was in favour of their admission to the university, but not to colleges that administered religious tests), and over the appointment of Hampden in 1836 to the regius chair of divinity increasingly isolated him from his former university. In 1838 he paid his last visit of any length. And he turned controversialist, publishing in 1841 <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Christ</span>. This contained an attack on apostolic tradition as the true foundation of the church, as opposed to the scriptures. Whately asserted that the reformers had been scrupulous to distinguish, and not to blend, scripture and tradition. Those who advocated a notion of authoritative tradition erected a double barrier to the pursuit of religious truth. They demanded that a Christian should not only believe the truths found in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but also a particular account of them. This doctrine Whately named the doctrine of double-reserve, and he accused its supporters of impiety since it created a barrier between man and God. In private he was less temperate: Tractarians were a &#145;pestilence&#146; and &#145;unthinking bigots&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 1.460; 2.21). He denied Pusey permission to preach in his archdiocese and in later years declined to receive Newman.<br>
<br>Whately also became increasingly out of sorts in Dublin: the 1850s saw the end of the Anglican&#150;Catholic period of relative harmony that Whately had sought to establish with his Catholic counterpart Archbishop Murray. On the one hand, ultramontanism became increasingly dominant in the Irish Catholic church. This became particularly significant in 1852 when, following the death of Archbishop Murray, the leading ultramontanist Paul Cullen was appointed in his place. On the other, popular protestantism, partly in reaction to ultramontanism, intensified. In England it was epitomized by Lord John Russell's <span class="italic">Letter to the Bishop of Durham</span> of 1850 attacking the pope's establishment of a Catholic hierarchy in England, a letter which Whately considered &#145;most absurd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 2.194); in Ireland it was represented by a series of protestant missions.<br>
<br>Whately was caught in this crossfire when in 1852 he sought to ensure that his <span class="italic">Scripture Lessons</span> and <span class="italic">Lessons on the Truth of Christianity</span>, which were on the Irish education board's list of approved books, were used in all of its model schools as he had believed them to be: he had visited Clonmel model school and found both to be absent. Archbishop Cullen openly attacked both books, in particular the latter as having been compiled for the purpose of giving a united religious instruction. The board gave way to such pressure: the <span class="italic">Lessons on the Truth of Christianity</span> was removed from the board's list of approved works and it ruled in relation to <span class="italic">Scripture Lessons</span> that it was not to be used in ordinary school business where any parent objected. Whately resigned from the board, which thus lost the last leading advocate of the Irish mixed system. The incident revealed him to be both dogmatic and out of touch. He had believed that the use of scripture extracts in mixed lessons was important not because they were a substitute for dogmatic religious instruction, but because they were a rational means of leading Catholics to rational religion (in other words, Anglicanism). However, by the 1850s the national system was in effect a denominational system (less than 5 per cent of its schools were under mixed management and three-quarters were under clerical managers, the vast majority of whom were Catholic).<br>
<br>Whately also became alienated from developments in liberal theology. He departed from his liberal friends when they departed, as they increasingly did, from an evidential defence of Christianity, and particularly of Christ's miracles. In the 1830s he had separated from Blanco White, whom he had taken to Dublin as private tutor to his children, when Blanco White embraced transcendental Unitarianism (he did, however, contribute to his pension). A more significant departure was his 1859 attack in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> on the former Noetic Baden Powell's <span class="italic">Order of Nature</span> (1859). (Until her death in 1844, Baden Powell had been married to Whately's wife's sister.) In this work Powell had argued that miracles were facts of faith, but impossibilities of science. Whately accused Powell of having joined the infidel party. Baden Powell returned to the same theme in his contribution to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860), which was published between the death of Whately's youngest daughter in March and that of his wife in April. (Powell himself died less than three months after publication.) There he explicitly attacked Whately's <span class="italic">Historic Doubts</span> as both anachronistic and wrong. Whately's response was simply to repeat his old argument: &#145;there are some who seem quite unfit to appreciate the <i>combined</i> force of several distinct probabilities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Remains</span>, 201).<br>
<br>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that by the 1850s Whately was increasingly ill at ease in Victorian intellectual life. As he wistfully noted in his last charge in 1863, in preceding generations those who had denied the truth of the scriptures had also been adverse to Christianity, but in the present generation a large proportion of those who professed themselves Christians &#145;were far more remote from what is commonly understood by the word than the religion of the Jews or of the Mahometans&#146;. This intellectual displacement was accompanied by physical ill health: in 1856 he suffered creeping paralysis of his left arm and leg and his left hand began to shake. By 1860 he was becoming very infirm and by 1861 the palsy had extended to his right hand; in 1863 he developed an ulcer in his right leg. His devotion to homoeopathy led him to refuse to consult the leading Dublin surgeons: in 1862 the Royal College of Surgeons had prohibited its members from applying homoeopathic cures. The disease made rapid progress and he died at Roebuck Hall, his country house outside Dublin, to which he had moved from Redesdale following his wife's death, at 11 a.m. on 8 October 1863. He was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral and Mozart's <span class="roman">Requiem</span> was performed at the service; his devoted black dog, Jet, followed him under the hearse to the cathedral.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Whately did not found a school. Unlike his contemporaries Newman and Arnold he did not have a deep emotional influence on his pupils. Although as archbishop of Dublin it was often alleged that he surrounded himself with a party of like-minded persons, they were not, in fact, promoted as a party. If two of his chaplains became Irish bishops, neither his clergyman son nor son-in-law obtained high ecclesiastical office. Nor did Whately achieve any influence with the Irish protestant upper classes: as Senior remarked, they hated his politics, disliked his political economy, were not favourably impressed by the total absence of pomp, and dreaded his jokes. To the Tractarians, his tactical concessions to liberal church reformers were a betrayal; of his episcopate, the high-church Thomas Mozley caustically remarked that he aimed at nothing and hit it. To the liberals, his Anglican apologetics became indefensible in the light of the development of scientific knowledge. Consequently Whately has best been remembered as a teacher, principally through his writings, of an eclectic collection of major Victorian thinkers: of Newman and his anti-Erastianism, of John Stuart Mill and his <span class="italic">System of Logic</span>, of Henry Mansel and his Christian agnosticism, and of Senior and his political economy.<br>
<br>That his memory was kept alive at all was due in no small part to the devotions of his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59106/', "(Elizabeth) Jane Whately (1822&#150;1893)")</script>. During his life she was his assistant, notwithstanding that she was determinedly more evangelical in outlook than he was; after his death she was his memorialist. In 1864 she published his <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Remains</span>, and in the 1870s she edited abridged versions of his anti-Tractarian <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Christ</span> and his <span class="italic">Errors of Romanism</span> from 1830. Above all, with the assistance of Herman Merivale, one of Whately's successors as Drummond professor of political economy, she was his biographer. The <span class="italic">Life and Correspondence of Richard Whately, DD</span>, first published in 1866 with subsequent editions in 1868 and 1875, is still the best account of Whately. Although it observes Victorian pieties in omitting controversy (it does not acknowledge the anonymous <span class="italic">Letters on the Church by an Episcopalian</span>, 1826), and at times it reads defensively, it is not blind to Whately's defects and idiosyncrasies.<br>
<br>More than a century after his death Whately has come to be appreciated as a major intellectual figure in his own right: historians have increasingly turned their back on the search for the origins of the great mid-Victorian conflicts between science and religion and of the secular social sciences in order to map out an earlier age when it was believed that it was possible to marshall the sciences as auxiliaries in the greater conflict between Christianity and atheism. Whately is now seen as a major exponent of this earlier position: as a consequence his eclectic teachings can be better appreciated as forming a unity. If the turning of the intellectual tide that he hoped to see in 1863 never happened, leaving him socially successful but intellectually anachronistic, it is at least possible to view him in an earlier age when he was both socially successful and intellectually inventive.<br>
