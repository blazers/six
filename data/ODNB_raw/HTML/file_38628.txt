<span class="headword">Burleigh,  Bennet Gordon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1840&#150;1914), <span class="occ">journalist and soldier</span>, was born in Glasgow. Little is known about his early life: in his later years he concealed his age, and his father has been variously described as a timber merchant and as a master mechanic. At the time of the Civil War, Burleigh went to the United States and served with the Confederates. By his own account he was involved in daring adventures&#151;being captured, twice sentenced to death, and twice escaping&#151;and was promoted captain. He worked as a journalist in the United States and, from about 1878, in England. Reporting the Bradlaugh affair, he once gained admittance to the lobby of the House of Commons by disguising himself as a gas fitter.<br>
<br>In 1882 Burleigh was employed by the British news agency Central News as a war correspondent in Egypt. He successfully reported the campaign there, achieving a notable scoop on the capture of Cairo. He was then hired for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> by its managing editor, John Merry Le Sage. This was the turning point of Burleigh's career: he worked for the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span>, reporting over twenty campaigns, until he belatedly retired in 1913. In the 1880s and early 1890s, before it was overtaken by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> had the largest daily-paper circulation, and its profits enabled it to provide Burleigh with the resources which made possible his further success as a war correspondent.<br>
<br>In 1884 in the Sudan, Burleigh reported Major-General Graham's Suakin campaign. In February he reported the battle of al-Teb and scooped his rivals. At the battle of Tamai, in March, the Hadendowa broke one of the British squares. Burleigh fought and helped rally the troops. His admirers later claimed he should, if eligible, have been awarded the Victoria Cross. In his reporting he criticized faulty British weapons. Later that year and in 1885 he reported the Gordon relief expedition. He fought at Abu Klea and Gubat, was wounded, mentioned in dispatches, and lost his kit in the Nile. In February 1885 he achieved an outstanding scoop by his report on the safe withdrawal of the desert column: the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> published a special Sunday edition. In his reporting he again criticized faulty weapons and ammunition. This contributed to public concern and questions in parliament, followed by an official inquiry and the introduction of improved weapons. Following the precedent set by W. H. Russell and Archibald Forbes, he compiled books&#151;six in all&#151;from his war correspondence, starting with <span class="italic">Desert Warfare</span> (1884) on the eastern Sudan campaign.<br>
<br>Like other war correspondents Burleigh also reported manoeuvres and other military events, and cultivated his military acquaintance. He was married&#151;his wife, Bertha, was a sculptor&#151;with five sons and three daughters. They lived in Brixton and later at 4 Victoria Road, Clapham, both areas favoured by journalists, and he was a member of the Savage Club. Despite working for a Conservative paper he was a self-declared advanced radical and socialist. He stood in Lanarkshire and Glasgow constituencies&#151;in 1885 as Liberal-Labour candidate, in 1886 as Liberal Unionist, and in 1892 for the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party, always unsuccessfully.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Burleigh reported the French invasion of Madagascar, the 1896 Asante expedition, the Spanish Riff war in Morocco, and the Graeco-Turkish War. In 1896 he published <span class="italic">Two Campaigns: Madagascar and Ashantee</span>. In 1898, a veteran and doyen of correspondents, he reported the Sudan War. Again he was successful and, when one of the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondents was wounded and the other killed, <span class="italic">The Times</span> used Burleigh's <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> report on the battle of Omdurman. In the controversy over the killing of Mahdist wounded and the treatment of the Mahdi's corpse, he defended Kitchener. He again criticized the War Office, and faults of weapons, ammunition, and equipment. Despite the controls and censorship he managed to outstrip his rivals and win the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> more scoops. He evaded Kitchener's attempted news embargo on the Fashoda affair, reporting it from leaked information. In 1898 he published <span class="italic">Sirdar and Khalifa</span>, and in 1899 <span class="italic">Khartoum Campaign, 1898</span>.<br>
<br>At the height of his reputation Burleigh reported the 1899 South African crisis and the opening Natal battles of the South African War. When Sir George White withdrew into Ladysmith and the siege was imminent the other correspondents decided to remain there. Burleigh, knowing he could report more elsewhere, left. He reported Sir Redvers Buller's campaign until after the failure at Vaal Krantz in February 1900, then Roberts's offensive and later the guerrilla war. In his reporting he included&#151;insofar as the censor permitted or could be evaded&#151;criticism of the War Office, and British generalship, tactics, and <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>. He emphasized the horror of Spion Kop and demanded an inquiry into the disaster. In 1900 he published <span class="italic">Natal Campaign</span>. At the end of the war he achieved another scoop, reporting by an apparently innocent cable the agreement on peace terms.<br>
<br>Burleigh next reported the war in Somaliland against Muhammad bin Abdullah, the &#145;Mad Mullah&#146;. In 1904 he reported the Russo-Japanese War, resenting the Japanese restrictions and censorship, and praising their military qualities. He demanded military training, as in Japan, in British state-aided schools. From this war correspondence he compiled <span class="italic">Empire of the East</span> (1905). He reported the Balkans, where his pro-Serbian sympathies offended the Austrian authorities. In 1909 he was seriously ill and thereafter, old and weakened, he lacked his former energy and aplomb. He reported the 1911 Tripoli campaign with the Italian forces, and the 1912 Balkan war with the Bulgarian forces&#151;his last campaign. He died at the Bell Hotel, Bexhill, Sussex, on 17 June 1914.<br>
<br>Burleigh was a big, heavy man&#151;brown-haired, blue-eyed, walrus-moustached, and with a loud and strident voice. Until his 1909 illness he was physically strong, with a tough constitution and exceptional endurance. He was aggressive, argumentative, and opinionated, &#145;as if his judgement was authoritative&#146;  (Bullard, 230), and alternated boisterous bonhomie and morose disagreeableness. He had the qualities then conducive to success as a war correspondent: he was brave&#151;repeatedly risking death&#151;enterprising, competitive, cunning, unscrupulous, and deceitful. Apparently on occasion he faked reports. Self-publicizing, he was not modest in describing his own adventures and achievements. He wrote vividly and acceptably&#151;though owing much to Edwin Arnold's editing of his copy&#151;identifying with the British troops and the imperial cause. He enjoyed war and war reporting, and, as his <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> obituary stated, &#145;embraced the career with the ardour of a lover&#146;. He was proud he was a professional correspondent and defended his profession against criticism, and asserted &#145;the clear right of the British public under our free institutions to have news dealing with the progress of their arms rapidly transmitted home&#146;  (Burleigh, <span class="italic">Khartoum</span>, 65&#150;6).<br>
<br>Burleigh was a controversial figure. Those who liked and praised him included Sir Evelyn Wood and the special artists Melton Prior and Frederic Villiers. He was not popular with his colleagues and was disliked and criticized by his rivals on other papers, &#145;largely because he was fiercely, and sometimes in their view, unscrupulously competitive&#146;  (Burnham, 66). Rivals who disliked and criticized him included the Liberal journalists Ernest N. Bennett and Henry W. Nevinson. According to Lord Burnham  (65) he was &#145;possibly the greatest of all war correspondents&#146;. In fact his achievements were inferior to those of W. H. Russell or Archibald Forbes, and neither in methods nor copy was he essentially original. Nevertheless he was outstandingly successful in his profession, and one of the leading war correspondents of the era. He was one of the last of the Victorian school of picturesque, adventurous war correspondents.<br>
