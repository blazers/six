<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coote, Sir  Eyre</span>  (1726&#150;1783), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the fourth son of the Revd Chidley Coote of Ash Hill, Kilmallock, in co. Limerick, and Jane, daughter of George Evans of Bulgaden Hall, co. Limerick, and sister of the first Lord Carberry.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17441757"></a>Early career, 1744&#150;1757</h2>It is assumed that he was brought up in Ireland, but nothing is known until the eighteen-year-old Coote was appointed ensign in Blakeney's or the 27th foot, the Inniskilling regiment, on 8 June 1744. Coote's military career began most inauspiciously when he took part as regimental colour bearer in the action near Falkirk on 17 January 1746 against the forces of Charles Edward Stuart. The ill-led, inexperienced regiment was routed in this battle; Coote was swept along in the panic retreat and reached Edinburgh ahead of his comrades still clutching the colour. In the ensuing court martial Coote was one of the four officers who underwent an exemplary trial for cowardice. Rather than being cashiered, he suffered the lesser penalty of suspension from the service, and his reappearance in the <span class="italic">Army List</span> of 1748 as a half pay cornet in the earl of Rothe's dragoons, with his commission still dated 1744, indicates that he was eventually forgiven for his conduct at Falkirk and subsequently. He may have seen service with the dragoons in Germany at the tail-end of the War of the Austrian Succession. On 18 April 1749 the half pay Coote transferred back on to the active list as a lieutenant by exchanging into the 37th foot under orders for Minorca. The regiment returned to England in 1755; Coote had received his captaincy in June that year and transferred again, this time to Adlercron's 39th foot, currently serving in India. He sailed in November 1755 in command of a reinforcement for the 39th, and joined the regiment at Madras in the late summer of 1756.<br>
<br>Coote had arrived at an opportune moment to distinguish himself. The opening of the Seven Years' War entailed renewed Anglo-French conflict in India, primarily in the Carnatic around Madras and Pondicherry. In addition, Coote found himself immediately pitchforked into a crisis in Bengal, where the Calcutta council of the East India Company had provoked the local Mughal governor (nawab), Siraj ud-Daula, to attack the settlement and to throw the British out of the province. Madras decided to send a naval&#150;military expedition under Admiral Charles Watson and Colonel Robert Clive to recover the situation. Captain Coote commanded one of the three companies detached from the 39th to join the company's troops and marines, which left Madras on 17 October, arriving at the mouth of the Ganges on 30 November. The force met little resistance in its progress up the river, retaking Fort William, Calcutta, without a fight on 2 January 1757. Belatedly, Siraj ud-Daula arrived outside Calcutta early in February with 40,000 men, apparently to cow the presumptuous British. But a daring, if ill-managed, march in the early morning mist right through the nawab's camp by a force of 2000 men led by Clive, with Coote in command of the Europeans, sufficiently alarmed Siraj to come to terms, restoring the company's position and paying damages.<br>
<br>The nawab, still hostile to the British, would have done well to protect their rivals the French, but he weakly allowed Watson and Clive to take the French base of Chandernagore early in March. Clive put Coote in command of the French fort. Then, when Clive joined a conspiracy brewing in Siraj's army against him led by Mir Jafar, his leading general, he promoted Coote temporary major and appointed him to command the advance guard in the march to the nawab's capital, Murshidabad, to supplant Siraj ud-Daula with Mir Jafar. Forty miles short of the capital, on the field of Plassey, Clive's 3000-strong force, which was supposed to have been joined by Mir Jafar's host, was confronted by the nawab with 50,000 men (including Mir Jafar) and fifty guns served by French artillery men. Coote was the most forceful and in a minority in Clive's council of war in arguing to accept battle; after reflection Clive was persuaded to agree. Siraj ud-Daula, destabilized by his justified fear of treachery in his own ranks, lost the battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757 in his own mind before ever a shot was fired, and not many had to be fired in an action later often celebrated as the beginning of the raj. Coote commanded one of the European divisions that pursued the retreating Mughal army. Clive later installed the grateful Mir Jafar as the new nawab and gave Coote his first independent command with orders to capture a fleeing French unit up the Ganges. Although the French eventually evaded him by escaping into the next province (Oudh), Coote had demonstrated his nerve, persistence, and leadership in keeping a small mixed force (750 men and 2 guns) of Europeans and Indians to a vigorous pursuit for 200 miles through alien and fairly hostile country at the height of the monsoon.<h2>
<a name="Middleyears17581772"></a>Middle years, 1758&#150;1772</h2>Like other veterans of Plassey, Coote had made a small fortune due to the largess of Mir Jafar, and the gloss of the victory gave his career a great boost. Back in England before Clive at the end of 1758, Coote was f&ecirc;ted in polite society and consulted as an India expert by William Pitt the elder, the leading figure in the coalition government. A year later the East India Company made Coote the next commander-in-chief of their forces in India to succeed Clive, and the king made him a lieutenant-colonel and gave him a new regiment (the 84th foot). Coote arrived back at Madras on 27 October 1759 and, finding the Anglo-French War was still in progress, took the field at the head of the Madras army. He was lucky, in his first major independent command, that he came to the conflict at a point where, after years of material inferiority in men and money, the British had a superiority at sea as well as on land and were now backed up by the resources of Bengal, while having deprived the French of theirs from the Northern Circars, a small territory, nominally owned by the nizam of Hyderabad, abutting the northern Carnatic. None the less, the arduous campaign Coote conducted between November 1759 and January 1761, when the starving garrison in the French headquarters at Pondicherry finally surrendered to him after a prolonged blockade and siege, marked him out as a highly competent tactician who led from the front (the sepoys titled him Coote Bahadur, Coote the Hero). His crowning victory over the French at Wandiwash (22 January 1760) was the biggest battle fought between the Europeans in India. He was, however, criticized at the time by the Madras council and later by his French opponent, the comte de Lally, for his lack of strategic vision when he failed to follow up his victory with an immediate march on Pondicherry while the French were demoralized and ill prepared to resist him. He preferred to spend another year reducing other forts in the Carnatic before finally closing in on the French capital.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1761, exercising his right as commander-in-chief of British forces in India, Coote sailed to Bengal with his regiment. He found that the council, Mir Jafar not having proved to their taste, had replaced him with his son-in-law Mir Kasim as nawab. Shortly after, Coote was sent up country to mediate in a dispute between Mir Kasim and his provincial chief at Patna. He failed in this, instead quarrelling with Mir Kasim over who should guard Patna's gates; diplomacy was never Coote's strong suit. Coote sailed for home in June 1762 and on the way married, on 8 July 1763, Susannah Hutchinson (<i>d</i>. 1812), universally admired daughter of the governor of St Helena. Back home in England, he bought an estate near Fordingbridge in Hampshire. In January 1764 a grateful East India Company presented him with a sword studded with diamonds and worth 700 guineas for his services in India, and in 1765 he was made a full colonel by the king. In 1768, in eighteenth-century fashion, he &#145;bought&#146; himself one of the Leicester parliamentary seats, sitting for the constituency until 1774, when he transferred to Poole, nearer home, until 1780. He appears to have played little part in parliamentary affairs, presumably seeing his seat simply as a status symbol and patronage asset. He sided with the Laurence Sulivan clique against Clive's friends in the house in the great feud which raged among the East India Company's directors in these years.<br>
<br>In 1769 the directors reappointed Coote as their commander-in-chief in the east and to be associated with the three commissioners they hoped would reform their corrupt administrations in India. This visit was brief and unhappy for all concerned. With no wars to fight, Coote, his ego in high gear, created political mayhem at Madras and Calcutta. His three commissioner colleagues were lost on the voyage out, throwing Coote's surviving independent powers into question; his loosely worded commission as commander-in-chief led him to claim military independence from the civilian governors who traditionally held the same titles in their presidencies to assert ultimate civil control over the army. Outfaced by the civilians, Coote returned home overland via Aleppo in summer 1771. Warren Hastings wrote feelingly of Coote to the chairman of directors after this sorry episode: &#145;May success and Honor attend him in any other part of the world, but God forbid that he should ever return to any part of India&#146;  (Hastings to Laurence Sulivan, 10 Feb 1772, BL, Add. MS 29126, fol. 125). Coote, none the less, found favour in Britain when he was knighted on his return.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer17731783"></a>Later career, 1773&#150;1783</h2>For five years (1773&#150;8) Coote, with his new regiment the 27th foot, acted as commandant of Fort George in Scotland, where James Boswell and Samuel Johnson visited him on their famous tour and Boswell characterized him as a &#145;most gentleman-like man&#146;  (Sheppard, 103). Further promotions made him major-general in 1775 and lieutenant-general two years later. In 1778, with war in America and possibly with the French in India, Coote once again was given the command-in-chief of the king's and company's forces there. He arrived at Madras with his wife in the last week of 1778 and, after reviewing the military establishment, in March 1779 he sailed on to Bengal to join the company's new supreme government in the east. He was immediately plunged into an intense political conflict at Calcutta, where Hastings was now governor-general, but could not get his way on policy owing to a hostile majority of non-company British government appointees on the council led by Philip Francis. But Hastings still held considerable executive authority and ensured that Coote was given all the independence in the military department (with considerable patronage) he could desire. Hastings was probably pleasantly surprised that Coote, who had resolved to stay out of politics, restored Hastings's power by falling in with all his non-military proposals. The chagrined Francis bitterly railed: &#145;Coote is despised by all parties; his faculties&#151;if he ever had any are gone&#146;  (ibid., 115).<br>
<br>A year later (October 1780) Coote was drawn down to the Carnatic once more to take command of the Madras army after the disaster it had suffered in August at the hands of Haidar Ali, the dynamic ruler of Mysore. He had invaded the province with a reputed 100,000 men the previous month and destroyed a large company detachment, while the main British force nearby disintegrated due to logistical collapse. Haidar was not able to take the major British-held forts in the province, but most of the smaller ones, garrisoned only by the nawab's troops, fell easily to him, and he asserted a stranglehold on the central Carnatic. Coote inherited a highly demoralized and greatly outnumbered army. His inadequate bullock supply for logistical support and lack of effective cavalry made it very difficult for him to venture far from the coast, where food was brought to him by sea. Even this supply route was unreliable owing to monsoon storms and with the arrival of a hostile French fleet which contested command of the coastal waters with a Royal Navy squadron.<br>
<br>In the circumstances it would have been remarkable if Coote, with a field force of 8500 men at first, had just managed to survive in the field, occasionally relieving the few British-held blockaded forts in the interior. These were, in fact, of no use to him as magazines for an extended campaign because they were too far apart to sustain his marches; they still had to be maintained, however, to ensure the political credibility of the nawab as effective ruler of the Carnatic and the military credibility of his British backer. And Coote did more. Haidar, despite having a much larger army but one much inferior in discipline and tactical control, had wisely adopted a policy of logistical attrition. His tens of thousands of light cavalry stripped the country of food around the British garrisons, threatened any supply columns which were not heavily protected, and made a desert around Coote's army when he tried to move it around. None the less, on four occasions Haidar allowed himself to be drawn into battle with Coote and was worsted each time. Arguably the action Coote fought at Porto Novo on 1 July 1781 was his finest. His army was in a very tight position, hemmed in on the coast, almost bereft of supplies and outnumbered ten to one. After carefully reconnoitring the ground, under fire, Coote coolly marched across Haidar's front behind some low sandhills, pinned his centre with well-placed artillery on one of the hills, and launched an infantry assault on his left flank which drove the Mysorean host from the field. It was a manoeuvre reminiscent of, perhaps inspired by, Frederick the Great's outstanding battle at Leuthen in 1757. However, as on other occasions, Coote for want of cavalry and sufficient transport was unable to exploit Haidar's withdrawal by inflicting a destructive rout on him. Nevertheless, by simply remaining undefeated in the field, he denied Haidar any claim to be in control of the Carnatic.<br>
<br>Coote's inability to drive Haidar out of the Carnatic occasioned a prolonged and bitter dispute with the civilian governor of Madras, Lord Macartney, which, as in 1760, calls into question Coote's strategic judgement. Macartney was critical of his alleged indulgence to his officers and men in allowing them so many followers that they outnumbered the fighting men four to one, making his army difficult to sustain in the field. The governor went on to suggest a far bolder strategy than the soldier was willing to entertain, to wit to draw Haidar out of the Carnatic by attacking his supply bases as Haidar was theirs. Macartney wanted to split Coote's army into two, ignore Haidar's forces in the Carnatic, and attack Mysore from the east at two points, while an amphibious Bombay force landed on Haidar's Malabar Coast in the west. Dividing his force in the face of a vastly larger and fleeter enemy army was anathema to Coote. Besides, as a king's officer (Coote, unlike some of his other British army colleagues such as the great Stringer Lawrence, never switched to the company's service), he put a higher priority on destroying the small French force (but with possibly more to come) which had established itself with strong naval support on the Coromandel Coast, south of Pondicherry. Coote's imperious character, bolstered by powers given him by the supreme council at Calcutta to have a wide independence in conducting military operations, ensured that he had his way. His relations with the civilian Madras government were as bad as they had ever been with the company's authorities. He hardly ever freely consulted them, and railed at Madras constantly for its failure to keep him adequately supplied, even though, for a variety of political reasons and Haidar's effective strategy, it was impossible to do so.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>The strategic dispute was never properly resolved because Coote, after a sojourn at Calcutta during the monsoon of 1782&#150;3, trying to recover his health, shattered by dedicated toil in the field, died on 27 April 1783, shortly after his return to Madras. The war with France ended a few months later, Coote's dilatory successor, General James Stewart, having failed to take the French stronghold at Cuddalore before a truce intervened. And Macartney, now free of Coote, was able to bring Tipu Sultan, Haidar's successor, to terms later that year by carrying out his converging strategy of squeezing Mysore from two directions and because the Mysoreans were being threatened by their inveterate Indian enemy the Maratha confederation.<br>
<br>Coote's qualities as a general were considerable: brave and cool on the battlefield and a great tactician. His strategic ability may have been over-cautious and unimaginative, though critics probably underplayed the stress under which Coote and his armies, always ill supplied and outnumbered, laboured. Several observers believed his powers were in decline in the last two years of his life. Macartney characterized him at this period as &#145;soured by disappointment, grown old, impaired in health, jealous and fractious&#146;  (Wylly, 276). Beloved of his sepoys, Coote was exceptional in his time in his care for ordinary soldiers and his concern to mention them in dispatches when merited; his presence always significantly raised the army's morale. Coote's unflagging commitment to his duty to the end, as well as his choleric temperament, probably brought on the stroke which killed him. He hardly ever got on with his civilian colleagues, and he was certainly venal, though this was common at the time in British India. After his death he was buried in Madras, but later his wife took his body back to England for interment in the parish church of Rockbourne, near his estate, on 14 September 1784. The couple had no children, and on Lady Coote's death in 1812 the estate passed to his nephew, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6244/', "Sir Eyre Coote")</script>. Coote's portraits (one is in the National Portrait Gallery) depict in full life a tall, robust man with strong but ill-proportioned features. There is a monument to him symbolizing a winged victory figure in Westminster Abbey.<br>
