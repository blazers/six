<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rae,  John Malcolm</span>  (1931&#150;2006), <span class="occ">headmaster and author</span>, was born at 2 Rutford Road, Streatham, London, on 20 March 1931, the son of (Lawrence) John Rae, radiologist, and his wife, (Annie) Blodwen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. He was educated at Bishop's Stortford College and, after national service as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he took a lower second-class degree in history. Competitive sport was the driving force that fuelled his already burgeoning ambition. He won half-blues for swimming and water polo, and narrowly missed a rugby blue. Swimming was a principal recreation to the end of his life.<br>
<br>After considering a career in the security services Rae decided to become a schoolmaster. During his teaching practice at Fettes College, Edinburgh, in 1955 he became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the headmaster, Donald Crichton-Miller, a powerful figure from whom he learned much about public school politics. Rae was advised by Crichton-Miller, a Cambridge blue and Scottish rugby international, to emphasize his sporting prowess, and in his first appointment as an assistant master at Harrow, from 1955, Rae was soon a successful coach of both swimming and rugby. At Harrow his lessons were remembered for their skilful organization. He had a commanding voice, and even then a physical presence that exuded authority. He was never a shrinking violet and the headmaster, Robert James, though an admirer, found him somewhat difficult to handle. When the first Wilson government set up the public schools commission in 1965, Rae suggested to the education secretary that he should represent the rank and file of the teaching profession. Although he was not appointed his opinions were canvassed and from this point his career and public profile blossomed. Meanwhile, on 17 December 1955, he had married Daphne Ray Simpson, the 22-year-old daughter of John Phimester Simpson, insurance manager. They had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Rae's eyes were always on a leading headmastership and he knew the potential handicap of his nonconformist background, moderate degree, and minor public school education. In his revealing autobiography, <span class="italic">Delusions of Grandeur</span> (1993), he admitted that he became an Anglican partly for career reasons, and took a doctorate at King's College, London, to bolster his academic standing. His thesis, on conscientious objectors in the First World War, was published in 1970 as <span class="italic">Conscience and Politics</span>. His doctorate was awarded in 1965, the day after he learned of his appointment to his first headmastership, at Taunton School. But even then his iconoclastic side was not trimmed by propriety and he said that many people who had doctorates were actually very dull. This was an accusation never levelled at Rae himself.<br>
<br>As a student of Napoleon, Rae was always conscious of the importance luck played in a career. He was one of the lucky generals in both of his principal appointments. When he had applied for the headmastership of Taunton School, three coincidental factors counted in his favour among the older governors: his father had practised briefly in Taunton in the 1930s; Crichton-Miller, his principal referee, had made his mark as a youthful head of Taunton before the war; and another admired predecessor, whom Rae somewhat resembled physically, had also been educated at Bishop's Stortford and Sidney Sussex.<br>
<br>Rae was always happiest when he had something big to tackle and he certainly found that at Taunton. The school was in need of a shake-up and under Rae it got it. When his wife attended the formerly all-male chapel on his first Sunday, the atmosphere, he recalled, was as though he had introduced a striptease dancer to the Athenaeum. He soon imposed his authority by expelling four senior boys, a necessary but courageous decision, as several private schools in Taunton fought over a diminishing market. Housemasters resented the weakening of their autonomy by his desire to build a sixth-form centre (opened by Princess Anne in his last term). In 1967 his pessimistic speech-day pronouncements on the future of the public school system caused much resentment. His address in 1969 on the failings of parents brought further trenchant publicity and the accusation that he was biting the hand that fed him. As a whispering campaign began, the fate of Crichton-Miller, whose headmastership of Stowe had recently been prematurely ended, was never far from Rae's mind.<br>
<br>Taunton had proved a baptism of fire and Rae had no qualms about moving on, indecently early even in the eyes of his opponents, when the opportunity of Westminster presented itself after four years. Once again luck played its part. His principal rival dropped out before interview, believing, mistakenly, that he was about to be appointed headmaster of Eton. Another contender accepted the headmastership of Christ's Hospital, for which Rae had also been a candidate. At his Westminster interview Rae was asked what he would do if rebellious pupils appeared at his door demanding a change to the rules. &#145;Invite them in for a sherry&#146; was his reply  (<span class="italic">Delusions</span>, 57). Such insouciance may have been too bold for some schools, but in the more urbane surroundings of Westminster it was a positive recommendation. Unexpected though his appointment was, it was a shrewd identification of the right man for the school at that time. He was exceptionally energetic and articulate, contributing widely to the national discourse on education policy. He was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> and was frequently interviewed on television and radio, where he always made a sound and courteous impression.<br>
<br>Westminster, a centrifugal institution well suited to Rae's personal dynamism, was a school that appealed to the liberal-minded professional classes, who felt that country boarding schools were outmoded. His great achievement, in an era of social and cultural upheaval, was to treat intelligent sixth-formers not as recalcitrant adolescents, but as putative undergraduates, so that for some even Oxford or Cambridge seemed anti-climactic by comparison. Westminster pupils during his reign knew that they were there to work. His priorities were well focused; what mattered were the big issues, such as co-education, changing adolescent mores, or drugs, on which he was rigorous and uncompromising. Conscious that he was headmaster of a great school almost by accident, he felt that he had to play out that role. As a self-publicist, who needed to be the centre of attention, he had a masterful whiggish public manner and kept the school in the spotlight.<br>
<br>Rae's constant public exposure led many outsiders to think he was neglecting the school, but this was not true. His energy and work-rate were prodigious. His immense stamina, helped by his regular 2 mile swims in the RAC pool in Pall Mall, was always an asset. He skilfully varied the routine with imaginative appointments, for example signing up the former England cricket captain Mike Brearley on a short-term contract. Parents were at ease with him (even if not with the television cameras that Rae allowed in to film the life of the school in 1979) and he was always more controversial outside the school than within it. He knew all his pupils by name, and provided a sympathetic ear for their problems, although some felt he was uneasy in the presence of emotion.<br>
<br>In an era of rampant inflation Rae coped well with the financial pressures on the school, especially as only 3 per cent of the pupils were the sons or daughters of Old Westminsters (against a comparable figure of 40 per cent at Eton). He undertook expansion on a limited site skilfully, with a new day house (Dryden's), a girls' boarding house in Barton Street, and a new Under School in Vincent Square. During his lengthy tenure girls became full members of the school for the first time and overall numbers rose from 464 to 640. The success of the school was in many ways compensation for his own academic record. In 1977 he proved a politically astute chairman of the Headmasters' Conference.<br>
<br>Rae's ultimate ambition was to move to Eton, but his failure in 1979 even to secure an interview was a watershed in his life. Westminster was not going to see him through to retirement and a change of career beckoned. Two factors hastened this process. His opposition to Margaret Thatcher's assisted places scheme in 1980, which he saw as subsidizing the cash-strapped middle classes, was at odds with the wishes of many of his governors. Characteristically he said &#145;You do not deal with a famine by sending a few lucky children to lunch at the Ritz&#146;  (<span class="italic">Delusions</span>, 174). Second, in 1983 his wife published a frank book on the public schools, <span class="italic">A World Apart</span>, criticism of which served as vicarious criticism of Rae himself. Rae supported his wife's freedom to publish what she wanted, but some felt that his authority had been undermined. Eventually his chairman, the dean of Westminster, felt it was time for a change. Rae had had a long innings and in 1984 he was privately given two years to find himself a new job. He left Westminster in March 1986. One of his last acts was to appoint a Barbadian girl as head of school, shocking those he called &#145;the croakers&#146; in the common room, though it was an appointment that proved an outstanding success.<br>
<br>After leaving Westminster Rae found no shortage of interesting opportunities. He was adopted as a parliamentary candidate by the Social Democratic Party, became a director of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (1986&#150;93), and was appointed director of the Laura Ashley Foundation (1986&#150;9), set up to foster educational opportunities for those who had left school without qualifications. From 1989 to 1996 he was the first director of the Portman Group, a trade body that promoted responsible use of alcohol. He was also a member of the National Board for Crime Prevention (1993&#150;5).<br>
<br>As an author Rae had an early success with <span class="italic">The Custard Boys</span> (1960), a sensitive story of evacuee children living out the war in a remote corner of the English countryside. The novel was filmed by Columbia as <span class="italic">Reach for Glory</span> (1962), in which Rae appeared in a cameo role, and for which he received a United Nations award. He wrote several other successful novels, initially for his own children, as well as books on the challenges facing British education, notably <span class="italic">The Public School Revolution</span> (1981) and <span class="italic">Too Little Too Late</span> (1989). In 2001 he published a biography of Sister Genevieve O'Farrell, principal of St Louise's, a comprehensive school for Catholic girls in west Belfast. His last major work was &#145;The agnostic's tale&#146;, a rigorous examination of his own religious doubts, which he completed in 2004 but which remained unpublished at his death.<br>
<br>John Rae was at the heart of the revolution that transformed private education in post-war Britain and he was the best-known public school headmaster of his day, combining exceptional leadership skills with a capacity to influence public life. He understood clearly how boarding schools would have to adapt to reflect changing social expectations and the demands of a generation of parents who were new to the independent school world. The process was sometimes painful and with his strong personality he divided opinion. Some felt he was the breath of fresh air desperately needed, especially on co-education; others that he was something of a Trojan horse, rarely tempering unpalatable truths with discretion&#151;he once observed, for example, that the tendency for Anglican priests to experience qualms of conscience about private schools stemmed from the time they could no longer afford them. He was never a bland figure, nor was he the traditional &#145;safe pair of hands&#146;. In this lay his individual strength. His willingness to follow his own instincts and avoid prevarication, together with his deep commitment to the welfare of all his pupils, gave him a special place in both the educational and social history of his times. His final years were clouded by the onset of cancer, which he faced with the same courage and realism that had characterized his professional career. He died at his home, 2S Cedar Lodge, Lythe Hill Park, Haslemere, Surrey, on 16 December 2006, and was survived by his wife and their six children. In 2009 Rae's diaries, <span class="italic">The Old Boys' Network</span>, were published, which gave an insight into the pressures faced by a late twentieth-century headmaster.<br>
