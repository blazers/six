<span class="headword">Denham,  Henry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1556&#150;1590), <span class="occ">printer</span>, of whose parents and family nothing is known, was apprenticed to the London printer and bookseller Richard Tottel on 14 October 1556 and was made free of the Company of Stationers on 30 August 1560. He set up his own printing house in White Cross Street, London, in 1564 but from 1565 was at the sign of the Star in Paternoster Row. Denham was involved in several controversies concerning printing privileges and in 1564&#150;5 he was fined for illicit printing. He was fined again in 1564&#150;5 for employing someone without informing the master and wardens of the company. The following year he was fined for &#145;mysvsying&#146; one of the wardens  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.316). He was admitted into the livery of the Stationers' Company on 20 July 1573, and held several posts within the company. He acted as an official searcher on several occasions and served as renter warden in successive years for 1579&#150;80 and 1580&#150;81, and as under-warden for 1586&#150;7 and 1588&#150;9. On 6 January 1579 he failed to attend before the lord mayor and incurred a fine of 12<i>d</i>., and in August he was fined for arresting a freeman of the company without a licence. However, a 20<i>s</i>. fine in April 1584 for using indecent speech to the upper warden was remitted.<br>
<br>Despite signing a petition against printing privileges in 1577, Denham benefited the following year when William Seres, no longer able to continue his own business, assigned his privilege for the printing of all psalters, primers, and prayers to Denham together with &#145;all his presses letters stock and copies&#146; for a yearly rent  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.771). Denham duly took seven young men from the Stationers' Company to assist him. By 1583 he was noted as operating four printing presses and in the same year, as executor with Ralph Newbery for Henry Bynneman, he also inherited Bynneman's privilege for printing dictionaries, chronicles, and histories. In January 1584 he was among several printers who made over their privilege in certain books for the benefit of the poor of the company. In 1585 he moved to Aldersgate Street where he remained until at least 1587; another survey of London printing presses, in 1586, recorded that he had three in operation. In 1587&#150;8 he was one of a number of senior members of the company who contributed towards the cost of the drawing up of the 1586 Star Chamber decrees concerning printing. In November 1589 he gave a gift to the company of a gilt spoon, about 3 oz in weight, engraved with his name.<br>
<br>Denham &#145;had a large and varied assortment of letters&#146; and his blacks were noted for their beauty  (McKerrow, 88&#150;9). His woodcut initials belonged to those known as the AS series which are attributed to Anton Sylvius, an Antwerp engraver. His mark was a star surrounded with the inscription <span class="italic">Os homini sublime dedit</span>. Among the many books to appear under this sign was the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Welsh which he printed for Humphrey Toy in 1567, four years after a bill was passed in parliament for the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to be translated into Welsh. He also printed <span class="italic">Bullokar's Booke at Large</span> (1580), the first attempt to establish orthography for English to appear in print. As an assignee of Henry Bynneman he was able to print the second edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> which Clair suggests was probably the edition which Shakespeare used.<br>
<br>We do not know the date of Denham's death, but he was last recorded in attendance at the court of the Stationers' Company on 4 July 1590. No book was printed under his sign after 1590.<br>
