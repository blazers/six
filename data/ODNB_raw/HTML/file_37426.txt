<span class="headword">Fowler,  Charles</span>  (1792&#150;1867), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 17 May 1792 in Cullompton, Devon, the son of John Fowler of Cullompton and his wife, Jane. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to John Powning, architect and builder, of Exeter. On the completion of his articles in 1814 he moved to London to work as an assistant in the office of David Laing, architect to the customs and excise, before setting up in independent practice there in 1818. In 1822 he won the competition for rebuilding London Bridge but the result was set aside in favour of the design by John Rennie, and the principal feature of his career, for which he gained notice on the continent as well as in Britain, was to be his speciality as a designer of large covered market buildings. One of his first commissions was the New market in Gravesend, Kent (1818&#150;22; dem.), and three major examples followed: the Covent Garden market (1828&#150;30) and Hungerford market (1831&#150;3; dem.) in London, and the Lower market in Exeter (1835&#150;7; dem.).<br>
<br>In these works, together with the great conservatory at Syon House (1827&#150;30), Fowler spanned the rapidly widening gap between architecture and civil engineering. A sophisticated functionalist economy of structure, embracing on occasion a highly innovative use of cast iron, was combined with an appropriately simplified neo-classical elevational style derived from French rationalist architects such as Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand. This rationalist approach is overtly expressed in Fowler's statement that:<blockquote>The proper excellence of architecture is that which results from its suitableness to the occasion &hellip; and this principle rightly pursued leads to <span class="smallcap">ORIGINALITY</span> without the affection of <span class="smallcap">NOVELTY</span>; but &hellip; the present enlightened epoch in architecture is woefully distinguished as having no character of its own nor any pretensions beyond that of adopting the various styles that have prevailed in all ages and nations without regard to the difference of circumstances upon which they were founded. (Taylor, &#145;Centenary memoir&#146;, 60)</blockquote>The critic John Claudius Loudon meanwhile described Fowler as &#145;one of the few modern architects who belong to the School of Reason and who design buildings on fundamental principles instead of antiquated rules and precedents&#146;  (ibid., 59).<br>
<br>Alongside this and particularly following the Exeter commission, Fowler also maintained his connection with his native county, where he had a long-standing patron in William Courtenay, tenth earl of Devon: his works there included the Totnes Bridge (1826&#150;8), a small group of churches, and alterations to the earl of Devon's Powderham Castle (1837&#150;48). The churches are mainly in a conventional Gothic style but the most ambitious, that of St Paul in Honiton (1835&#150;8), is in the neo-Norman manner. In 1835 he was one of the founder members of the Institute of British Architects, from 1836 to 1843 he was one of the institute's joint honorary secretaries, and in 1850&#150;51 he was elected a vice-president. He also contributed a number of papers to the institute's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and to Loudon's <span class="italic">Architectural Magazine</span> and published posthumously <span class="italic">A description of the plan for the revival of Hungerford market, with some particulars of the buildings proposed to be erected</span> (1929). Many of his designs were exhibited at the Royal Academy. James Mountford Allen and Henry Roberts were his pupils.<br>
<br>Fowler retired from practice in 1852 because of ill health, and moved first to Kent and then to Buckinghamshire, where he died at his home, Wester House, Great Marlow, on 26 September 1867. His son Charles Fowler (<i>c</i>.1823&#150;1903), architect, studied under his father and then in Germany. He became a fellow of the RIBA and practised in London.<br>
