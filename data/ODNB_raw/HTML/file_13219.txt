<span class="headword">Hicks,  William Robert</span>  (1808&#150;1868), <span class="occ">asylum superintendent and humorist</span>, was born at Bodmin, Cornwall, on 1 April 1808, the son of William Hicks (<i>d</i>. 1833), a schoolmaster of Bodmin, and Sarah, daughter of William and Margaret Hicks. He was educated under his father until 1824, and then under a Mr Harvey at Plymouth. From 1832 to 1840 he kept a boys' boarding-school in Honey Street and on the Castle Hill, Bodmin, and was noted for his extensive knowledge of mathematics. In 1834 he became clerk of the Bodmin board of guardians and superintendent registrar. In that same year, he married Elizabeth, daughter of George Squire of Stoke Damerel, Devon.<br>
<br>In 1840 Hicks was appointed domestic superintendent of the Cornwall County Lunatic Asylum, clerk of the asylum, and clerk to the committee of visitors at Bodmin, and soon after was also named clerk to the highway board. The earl of Devon later procured for him the additional situation of auditor of the metropolitan district asylums. When Hicks became connected with the Bodmin asylum he found the old system of management prevailing, and, in conjunction with the medical superintendent, introduced more humane modern methods. One patient who was chained in a dark cell as a dangerous lunatic turned out to be a wit and a philosopher. He was found to be harmless, and employed to take care of the pigs and do other useful work. In 1865&#150;6 Hicks was mayor of Bodmin, when he revived the custom of beating the bounds of the town  (Maclean, 229).<br>
<br>Hicks was a witty speaker, and especially famous for telling a story. He was popular in Cornwall and Devon, and had an established reputation in London, being known as the &#145;Yorick of the West&#146;. His memory was excellent, and he was an admirable mimic. His wit, musical talent, and good taste in art made him a favourite in society, especially in company with his old friend George Wightwick, the architect. Many of Hicks's narratives were in the Cornish dialect, but he was equally adept in the Devon, as well as in the peculiar talk of the miners. Among his best-known stories were &#145;The Coach Wheel&#146;, &#145;William Rabley&#146;, &#145;The Gallant Volunteer&#146;, and &#145;The Dead March in <i>Saul</i>&#146;. His best-known story, &#145;The Jury&#146;, referred to the trial in 1817 of Robert Sawle Donnall, accused of poisoning his mother-in-law, when each of the jurors gave a different and ludicrous reason for acquitting the prisoner. On 31 December 1860 Hicks resigned his connection with the lunatic asylum, retiring on a full pension. He died at Westheath (a residence which he himself had built), Bodmin, on 5 September 1868, and was buried at Bodmin cemetery on 9 September. He was survived by his wife who married her second husband, J. Massey, in 1876.<br>
