<span class="headword">Batsford,  Henry George <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1880&#150;1951), <span class="occ">publisher and author</span>, was born at 37 Cold Harbour Lane, London, on 18 April 1880, the only son of Henry George Batsford (<i>b</i>. 1851), publisher and bookseller, who died two years later, and his wife, Matilda, daughter of William Ward. He was educated at Henley House School, Kilburn, London, where his science master was H. G. Wells, and at the City of London School. In 1897, after studying briefly in Germany, he entered the family bookselling and publishing business which had been founded fifty-four years earlier by his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38976/', "Bradley Thomas Batsford")</script>. In 1917 he succeeded his uncle, Herbert Batsford, as chairman and managing director of B. T. Batsford Ltd, and he remained in that position until his death.<br>
<br>In 1926 Harry Batsford's work as a publisher of books on the technique and history of architecture was recognized by his election as an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In the early thirties, responding to economic pressure and changing taste, Batsford widened the scope of his firm's activities: he initiated more than one series of books, fully illustrated by photographs, on the architecture and topography of Britain, which gave the term &#145;a Batsford book&#146; a recognized significance. These series, of which the best-known were the <span class="roman">British Heritage</span> and the <span class="roman">Face of Britain</span>, introduced to a new and wider public the beauties of Britain's landscape and ancient buildings and were not without influence in helping to preserve both from destruction. Batsford himself wrote, sometimes pseudonymously, or in collaboration with Charles Daniel Fry, a number of works, among them <span class="italic">Homes and Gardens of England</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Landscape of England</span> (as Charles Bradley Ford, 1933), <span class="italic">The Cathedrals of England</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">The English Cottage</span> (1938). One of his authors, John Russell, recorded that of Batsford's &#145;passion for architecture there could never be any doubt; and in this, as in everything else, his inclination was always to put aside what was notorious and large in favour of what was plain, inviolate and true&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, April 1952).<br>
<br>Batsford published Gertrude Stein, Cecil Beaton, Sacheverell Sitwell, A. E. Richardson, and the popular series of social histories by Marjorie and C. H. B. Quennell. One Batsford book, James Pope-Hennessy's <span class="italic">London Fabric</span>, won the Hawthornden prize. In 1930 the firm moved from 94 High Holborn to an elegant Mayfair town house at 15 North Audley Street. During the Second World War, Batsford and some of his staff relocated to Malvern Wells.<br>
<br>In 1928 Batsford married Rose Verene (<i>d</i>. 1930), daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois Andr&eacute; Sennwald, of Chaux de Milieux, Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland; there were no children. In himself Batsford was vital, generous, and individualistic. He loved England and knew the country and its antiquities with exceptional intimacy, but he also felt himself a citizen of the world and had travelled enthusiastically in Europe and America. Apart from architecture, he had a keen amateur's knowledge of subjects as diverse as astronomy, natural history, geology, railway locomotives, and watches. He had a great fondness for animals, particularly for cats, for whose welfare he left a special legacy in his will. Batsford died at Paddington Hospital, London, on 20 December 1951, of barbiturate acid poisoning (self-administered); the coroner returned an open verdict on the circumstances of his death.<br>
