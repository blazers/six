<span class="headword">Owen,  George</span>  (1552&#150;1613), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Henllys, Nevern, near Newport, Pembrokeshire. He was the son of the lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21036/', "William Owen (c.1488&#150;1574)")</script> and Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1603), daughter of Sir George Herbert of Swansea and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Berkeley, and niece of William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke of the second creation. Nothing is known of his early education although it is likely that he received tuition in the law and estate management from his father. On 4 October 1571 William Owen settled the barony of Cemais on George, with the castle of Newport and the advowson of six churches; George's father had acquired the barony from Lord Audley. George Owen was married the same year to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1606), daughter and coheir of William Philipps of Picton Castle and his wife, Janet, daughter of Thomas Perrot of Haroldston and sister of Sir John Perrot. Philipps and Perrot were the two most powerful figures in Pembrokeshire, but much at enmity, and it was at a fracas between the two adversarial factions that occurred at Haverfordwest on 9 February 1572 that Owen made his first recorded public appearance. A retaliatory assault had been proposed upon Owen's pro-Perrott neighbour, and, although the latter (Thomas ab Owen of Pentre Ifan) prudently stayed at home, Owen's men were arrested, which was regarded as a calculated rebuff to the young lord of Cemais. He was admitted at Barnard's Inn on 5 August 1573 but there is no record of the duration of his stay there.<br>
<br>With his wife, Elizabeth, Owen had eleven children, four of whom died in infancy. She died in 1606 and, not long afterwards, he married his mistress, Anne or Ankred (<i>d</i>. 1634), daughter of William Obiled, a Carmarthen tucker, with whom he had already had seven illegitimate children. Deeply conscious of his position as lord of Cemais, Owen spent much time in litigation over claims to the seigneurial rights pertaining to the former marcher lordship, which had been neglected by the Audleys, who had their main baronial estate at Heleigh in Staffordshire. In his efforts to reinstate feudal rights he discomfited his tenants, who were indisposed to pay lapsed rents or perform outdated services; and in 1606, as none of the burgesses was prepared to collect the rents and dues, he was unable to exercise his right to appoint the mayor of Newport. He was also unpopular with his gentry neighbours, who reported him to the privy council charged with forgery and counterfeiting deeds, and he was arrested while sitting in his own court at Newport on 27 November 1579. His house was searched, but no incriminating evidence was found. These and other charges having failed, he was accused of adultery before the ecclesiastical commissioners, which he could not well deny. In his endeavour to prove that the lordship of Cemais had come to his father by descent rather than by purchase, Owen, although he was the leading genealogist in west Wales and had produced the first armorial in Wales, extended his pedigree and gave a misleading account of his coat of arms.<br>
<br>Owen's main interest lay in the land, and his desire to improve agriculture and methods of husbandry led him to investigate and describe the basic geological features of Pembrokeshire. The soil needed lime, he contended, and to enable farmers to find it, he traced the outcrops of limestone and discovered that they ran in close parallel with the veins of anthracite coal that was required to fire the limekilns. His description of clay marl, which he championed as a fertiliser in his unpublished &#145;Treatise of marle&#146;  (NL Wales, Bronwydd MS 3, fols. 218&#150;22), enabled it to be recognized as glacial till, though he subscribed to the common belief that it was the deposit of Noah's flood. His contribution to geological study was later acknowledged when he was dubbed &#145;the patriarch of English geologists&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 73, 1841, 3). His condemnation of the exposure of unschooled young men and boys to the elements while herding cattle gave him reason to recommend enclosure and to establish a school at Felindre Farchog, near Henllys, for their education.<br>
<br>Owen's interest in cartography became apparent in his claim that Saxton's map of Pembrokeshire (1579) gave an exaggerated view of the county and led to an unfair demand for men for the musters. He carried out a survey and produced a map of the county in 1602, bordered by lists of hundreds, baronies, towns, castles, forests, and other features, and emblazoned with the arms of the leading county families. When Camden published maps of the counties in the 1607 edition of his <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, most of them by Saxton and Norden, he invited Owen to provide the map for Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>Owen took his public duties and responsibilities seriously. He was placed on the commission of the peace about 1584 and, in 1587, when Henry, earl of Pembroke, was made lieutenant of Wales, he appointed Owen and Thomas Perrot his deputy lieutenants in the county of Pembroke. He served two terms as sheriff of the county, in 1587, and again in 1602, when he had the unpleasant duty of arranging the execution of two brothers, kinsmen of his first wife, who had killed a cousin in a brawl. He was one of the commissioners appointed to survey and value the estate of his lifelong enemy, Sir John Perrot, who had died attainted in the Tower of London in 1592. He was made deputy vice-admiral of the counties of Pembroke and Cardigan in 1598. The vulnerability of Milford Haven in the event of invasion by the Spaniards caused him concern and he conducted a survey with a view to providing coastal defence. In November 1595 the earl of Pembroke wrote to &#145;my very good cozen George Owen, esquier&#146; stating that he had &#145;long expected&#146; to receive from him a map of the Haven that he could show to the queen. Owen sent him the map, which has since been lost, together with &#145;a pamphelett conteigninge the description of Mylford havon&#146;  (Owen, <span class="italic">Description of Penbrokshire</span>, ed. H. Owen, pt 2, 531&#150;2), and he made proposals for its defence.<br>
<br>Owen was fortunate in having lived at a time when there was an awakening of interest in Welsh antiquities and although he resided in a remote part of Wales, he had a well-stocked library at Henllys. He gathered around him a coterie of antiquaries, including George Owen Harry and George William Griffith, and maintained contact with others such as the poet&#150;genealogist Lewys Dwnn, and with William Camden whom he visited at the College of Arms while pursuing his researches in London. He employed three permanent scriveners.<br>
<br>Owen's most important work, <span class="italic">The Description of Penbrokshire</span>, was begun in December 1602, soon after the appearance of Richard Carew's <span class="italic">Survey of Cornwall</span>, and it was completed on 18 May 1603. He then proceeded to write a &#145;Second Booke&#146;, giving a detailed history parish by parish, but only a fragment survives, which was published by B. G. Charles in the <span class="italic">National Library of Wales Journal</span>. Although Owen was a prolific writer, none of his work appeared in print during his lifetime, nor did any until Richard Fenton published a section of the &#145;First booke&#146; containing an account of the ancient game of knappan in <span class="italic">The Cambrian Register for the Year 1795</span> (1796). In the <span class="italic">Register</span> for the following year, Fenton produced the remainder of the work as &#145;A history of Pembrokeshire, from a manuscript of George Owen, esq., of Henllys, lord of Kemes, with additions and abbreviations by John Lewis, esq., of Manarnawan&#146;. It was indifferently edited and John Lewis's observations were so &#145;very largely interlarded with personal invective and private anecdotes&#146; that they had to be expurgated. After Fenton's death in 1821 the manuscript passed to his son who sold it to Sir Thomas Phillipps and, by 1892, it was in the hands of the marquess of Bute from whose descendant it was acquired by the National Library of Wales  (NL Wales, MS 13212). A later version of the manuscript was purchased from the bookseller Thomas Osborne by William Oldys in December 1738 for Edward Harley, earl of Oxford, at whose death in 1753 it was among his collection bought by parliament and placed in the British Museum  (Harley MS 6250). It is now in the British Library.<br>
<br>George Owen's <span class="italic">Description of Penbrokshire</span> first appeared in book form in 1892 when it was published by the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion as number 1 in its <span class="roman">Cymmrodorion Record Series</span>. The society published three further volumes under the same title. The second volume (1897) contained collections of papers relating to Pembrokeshire and to the barony of Cemais in particular, together with &#145;A cataloge and genelogie of the lordes of the baronye of Kemes seethence the conquests&#146;, accounts of suits in Star Chamber, the inquisitions post mortem of William Owen and George Owen, and &#145;The description of Milford Haven&#146;. Part 3 (1906) comprised &#145;The dialogue of the government of Wales&#146;, which took place between Barthol, a German civil lawyer, and Demetus, recognizable as the author; &#145;Cruell lawes against Welshmen &hellip; made by Henrie the ffourth&#146; following the failure of his attempts to quell the rebellion of Owain Glyn D&#373;r, laws that the author considered to be malicious; and &#145;A treatise of lordshipps marchers in Wales&#146;, and &#145;The description of Wales&#146;, which listed the lordships, towns, and features of each of the counties of south Wales. The editor stated that part 4 would include the remainder of the Welsh counties, &#145;The fragmentes of Wales&#146; (1606&#150;11), containing a collection of notes on the marcher lordships and the principality of Wales, and &#145;The treatise of marle&#146;, but he did not live to complete the work and the volume did not appear until 1936. <span class="italic">The Description of Penbrokshire</span> was next published in 1994. A facsimile edition of Owen's commonplace book, <span class="italic">The Taylors Cussion</span>, was published in 1906, containing inventories of livestock, lists of high office-holders, <i>aides-m&eacute;moire</i> and mnemonic verses, and passing thoughts.<br>
<br>Owen displayed the traditional Welsh hospitality towards the itinerant Welsh bards who came to Henllys and sang his praise during his lifetime but, strangely, no elegies survive. At his death, the main part of his collection of manuscripts passed to his neighbour and assistant, George William Griffith of Penybenglog, though some went to his natural son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21000/', "George Owen")</script>, York herald, and, after passing through many hands, they were gathered together by Edward Protheroe and acquired in 1828 by the College of Arms, where they remain as the Protheroe collection.<br>
<br>Although a protestant and an anti-papist and patron of six churches, Owen made little reference to religion, except that he upheld the sanctity of the sabbath and welcomed the translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Welsh. No likeness of him exists. It is known that he was lame as the result of an infirmity suffered in his right leg when he was four years of age and, from middle age onward, he suffered from the gout in both legs; but this did not prevent his travelling long distances in pursuit of his researches, when he had to be lifted on to his horse and to his bed. His personal character is veiled behind his insistent efforts to establish himself as a feudal lord. He died on 26 August 1613 at Haverfordwest; his body was taken to Henllys and was buried at Nevern church, where a brass plaque commemorates him.<br>
<br>Owen left no will, and the disposal of his estate by his only legitimate son, Alban Owen (1580&#150;1656), led to disputes, many of them arising from an insistence on maintaining the manorial customs as his father had done. He followed his father also in his public duties as justice of the peace, deputy lieutenant, and twice as sheriff of the county of Pembroke. During the civil war he was nominated by parliament to put the militia ordinance into execution in Pembrokeshire, but he was a royalist and signed royalist declarations which led to the sequestration of his estate. A collection of the arms of the London City companies with Alban Owen's signature attached is preserved in the Phillipps Library at Cheltenham  (MS 13140, no. 106).<br>
<br>Among Owen's natural children with Anne Obiled were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21000/', "George Owen (c.1598&#150;1665)")</script>, York herald and Evan Owen (1599&#150;1662), who matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, in 1622 and proceeded BA the same day, MA on 21 June 1625, BTh on 31 August 1636, and DTh on 12 April 1643. Evan was appointed to the rectories of Newport (17 February 1623), Llanychlwydog (14 July 1626), and Walwyn's Castle (22 May 1638), and was installed chancellor of St David's on 8 May 1645. He died on 30 December 1662 and was buried at Llawhaden church where a mural tablet was placed to his memory.<br>
