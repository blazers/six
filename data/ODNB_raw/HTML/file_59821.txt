<span class="headword">Shackleton,  Lydia</span>  (1828&#150;1914), <span class="occ">botanical artist</span>, was born on 22 November 1828 at Grisemount, Ballitore, co. Kildare, Ireland, the third of the thirteen children of George Shackleton (1785&#150;1871), a flour miller, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher (1803&#150;1873). The family were staunch Quakers. Lydia was probably taught at home by a governess, and subsequently studied in the Royal Dublin Society School of Art and Design. In her diary she recalled that &#145;When at the School of Design I copied a wild violet which was considered by myself and others a chef d'oeuvre. I painted it with excited happy feelings&#146;  (Nelson and Sayers). The earliest of her known works date from this period, the late 1840s; two drawings in pencil, of Grisemount and Ballitore, dated 15 November 1848, were reproduced in a privately printed booklet <span class="italic">Lydia Shackleton (1828&#150;1914)</span> (1947). Being one of the eldest children, Shackleton became responsible for educating her younger brothers and sisters. In the early 1850s she taught her sisters to draw while practising drawing and painting herself. Later, when she lived in Lucan, co. Dublin, she taught her infant nephews and nieces. Shackleton enjoyed teaching, but her preferred occupations were reading, painting, and gardening. She also wrote poetry. In April 1853 Shackleton moved to the family's newly acquired mill at Lyons, co. Kildare, where she was housekeeper for her elder brother Joseph. About 1860, when the Anna Liffey Mills at Lucan, co. Dublin, were purchased by the family, she moved there and lived at 7 The Mall, Lucan, for the rest of her life, except for two lengthy periods (1873&#150;6 and 1888&#150;9) when she was in the United States visiting cousins. While in America she painted; a few na&iuml;ve sketches and landscapes, and numerous botanical watercolours survive (National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin).<br>
<br>Shackleton's principal work was undertaken for the Royal (now National) Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin. She began painting plants growing at Glasnevin about September 1884. Her association continued for twenty-three years, until December 1907, when her deteriorating eyesight forced her to give up painting. In that period she completed about 1500 botanical studies. The majority portray orchids, the particular interest of Frederick Moore (1853&#150;1949), director of the gardens. More than 1000 orchid paintings, each signed L.S., survive in the Glasnevin Gardens, as well as portraits of other miscellaneous garden plants including <i>Paeonia</i>, <i>Sarracenia</i>, <i>Helleborus</i>, and <i>Lachenalia</i>. She also painted about one hundred Irish native wild species for the Science and Art Museum, Dublin; these paintings are now in the National Botanic Gardens.<br>
<br>None of Shackleton's paintings was reproduced during her lifetime. However, a plate showing the orchid <i>Moorea irrorata</i> (<span class="italic">Neomoorea wallisii</span>), published under Matilda Smith's name in <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span> (1891), and another, published in <span class="italic">The Garden</span> (16 October 1886), showing two pitcher-plant (<i>Sarracenia</i>) hybrids raised at Glasnevin, may have derived from two of her paintings. Shackleton generally used watercolour, and painted on coloured papers which allowed her to employ gouache for white flowers. As a rule she painted a single blossom face on; rarely did she depict whole plants, and very rarely were dissections of the flowers or lateral views included. Thus much of her work cannot be considered truly scientific. Her early botanical portraits are of a consistently high quality but as her eyesight deteriorated in the early 1900s, so too did the precision of her work.<br>
<br>Shackleton is said to have had views, religious and otherwise, ahead of her time which estranged her from her mother who was a &#145;Quaker of the old school&#146;  (Shackleton, [i]). She never married. She died of heart failure at her home, 11 Garville Road, Rathgar, Dublin, on 10 November 1914, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground, Temple Hill, Blackrock, co. Dublin.<br>
