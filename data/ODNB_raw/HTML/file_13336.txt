<span class="headword">Hincks, Sir  Francis</span>  (1807&#150;1885), <span class="occ">politician and journalist in Canada</span>, was born on 14 December 1807 at Cork, Ireland, the youngest of the seven children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13338/', "Revd Thomas Dix Hincks (1767&#150;1857)")</script> and his wife, Anne Boult (1767&#150;1835). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13335/', "Edward Hincks")</script> was his elder brother. Hincks's father left the Presbyterian ministry for a teaching career, and in 1821 joined the Royal Academical Institute at Belfast, where Hincks received his early education. Two of his brothers became prominent academics and a third, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13339/', "William Hincks")</script>, became a Unitarian minister; Hincks was also a Unitarian for most of his life, though about 1871 he became a member of the Church of England. After a year at the University of Belfast, Hincks worked for five years at John Martin &amp; Co., a Belfast shipping firm. Restless, he visited the Canadas in 1830&#150;31, and in September 1832 he returned there with his new bride and settled in York (renamed Toronto in 1834), Upper Canada. Martha Anne Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1874), whom he married on 29 July 1832, came from Legoniel in northern Ireland; they had five children. In premises rented from some protestants from Cork, William Warren Baldwin and his son Robert, he started a mercantile business.<h2>
<a name="Arisingbourgeoispolitician"></a>A rising bourgeois politician</h2>Despite the growth of Upper Canada's population from 75,000 people in 1812 to 450,000 by 1842, Hincks failed in his business and moved into banking and insurance. Although he managed businesses only of the second rank, he acquired a lasting reputation as a top-class financial manager. The 1830s were formative in other ways, too. Given his father's reformist political views, Hincks's close relationship with Robert Baldwin, the colony's leading moderate reformer, was predictable. The Baldwins were well-off lawyers, members of Upper Canada's patrician &eacute;lite. Hincks, while hardly poor&#151;his mother enjoyed a substantial inheritance&#151;was more the respectable man on the make with an eye for the main chance, but he was, like the Baldwins, an Irish protestant. In the increasingly bitter political conflicts that beset the colony in the 1830s, Hincks became a prominent political tactician and controversialist.<br>
<br>In 1836 Hincks was appointed secretary of Toronto's Reform Constitutional Society, which protested against the &#145;unconstitutional proceedings&#146;  (Read and Stagg, 48) of the lieutenant-governor, Sir Francis Bond Head, an avid supporter of the tory family compact. Increasingly frustrated, some reformers followed William Lyon Mackenzie in an unsuccessful armed rebellion in 1837. Although Hincks opposed rebellion and favoured a form of responsible government which would render the executive council answerable to the assembly, some of the directors of the Bank of the People, which he managed, were implicated in the affair. Hincks went into hiding until tempers cooled. Discouraged, he considered moving to Iowa, but a land deal collapsed. When the British government appointed Lord Durham (the earl of Lambton) to determine the reasons for the Canadian uprisings, reformers rallied. Hincks resigned from the bank and became owner and editor of <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, a Toronto paper dedicated, as its masthead proclaimed, to &#145;responsible government and the voluntary principle&#146;. Leading tories soon branded Hincks as the most effective reform leader: his writings, one tory lamented, are &#145;of a character to unhinge the public mind&#151;and are leading to much and serious mischief&#146;  (Sanderson, 2.283). Hincks's editorials helped move Durham towards the moderate reform camp.<br>
<br>When Durham's recommendations for closer links between the executive council and the assembly and for uniting the two Canadas reached Upper Canada in April 1839, reformers rejoiced. Realizing the importance of reform unity under the proposed union, Hincks quietly encouraged an alliance between the leading French-Canadian reformer, Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine, and Robert Baldwin, and by acting as political broker helped construct the framework within which union politics would unfold.<br>
<br>The union's first governor, the ex-businessman Charles Poulett Thomson (Lord Sydenham), had an important influence on Hincks. Thomson opposed party development and wished to govern in harmony with the assembly. Hincks initially feared that this would mean tory one-party rule and strongly opposed Sydenham's position. But after being elected as a member of the assembly for Oxford, a rural Upper Canadian community, he gradually re-evaluated his stance. In fact Hincks and Sydenham had much in common: both were pragmatists; both wished, as Sydenham put it, to &#145;take the moderates from both sides&#146;  (Mills, 117), or, as Hincks later advised Baldwin, &#145;to select [for patronage] Tories from the same class that we select our friends&#146;  (Mills, 120), and both looked to the politics of economic development as the ultimate means of effecting political and social stability. Hincks supported many of Sydenham's economic policies: a proposed Bank of Issue, the creation of district councils and a board of works, and the use of a British loan of &pound;1.5 million for canal construction. His support of Sydenham led to a temporary break with Baldwin and other Reformers and, more lasting, to his being labelled a political opportunist.<br>
<br>In 1842 Hincks sold <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> and became inspector-general (finance minister) under Sydenham's successor, Sir Charles Bagot. Baldwin and LaFontaine soon joined him in the ministry. Before conflict could emerge over whether responsible government was in operation (whether the governor or the executive council answerable to the assembly controlled patronage), Bagot, severely ill, resigned. Hincks saw responsible government as an opportunity to play an important role on an expanding colonial stage. He visualized himself fighting the &#145;battle of the middle classes against the aristocracy&#146;  (Mills, 117), and through control of the executive he hoped to effect a social revolution, putting in place a society run by respectable men of business. The imperial government had to provide sufficient scope for the realization of these ambitions. Bagot's successor, Sir Charles Metcalfe, refused to provide such scope: Baldwin, LaFontaine, and Hincks resigned in November 1843 in protest at his refusal to allow them control of patronage.<br>
<br>Hincks then moved to Montreal and founded a Reform paper, <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>, and helped unite Irish and French-Canadian workers for the Reform cause. After being defeated in the ensuing election he spent much of his own money in a struggle to keep <span class="italic">The Pilot</span> afloat. In 1848, when LaFontaine and Baldwin, victors in the 1847 election, were asked to form a ministry, Hincks sold <span class="italic">The Pilot</span> and joined them as inspector-general.<h2>
<a name="Thepoliticalascendancyofthemiddleclass"></a>The political ascendancy of the middle class</h2>Arguably Hincks was the ministry's most important member. He stabilized the government's chaotic financial affairs. When the <span class="roman">Rebellion Losses Bill</span>, which indemnified rebels for property losses in 1837, excited tory riots in Montreal, Hincks kept London investors on side. He argued for strict punitive measures against public officials who signed the annexation manifesto circulated as a response to England's repeal of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> and the apparent end to protected trade with Britain. He worked for a reciprocity trade agreement with the United States, and signed one in 1855. Following Sydenham's ideas, he promoted the immigration of Britain's surplus population, who would work on public projects financed by imperial loans. The loans would be paid off by the sale of public lands to the immigrants. But a major weakness in the programme, overlooked by Hincks, was the fact that the most valuable crown land had long since been sold.<br>
<br>Between 1848 and 1851 as inspector-general, and from 1851 to 1855 as co-leader (with A. N. Morin) of the Reform government, Hincks followed this programme. When the imperial government refused financial support, Hincks attracted leading British capitalists and railway builders by providing loan guarantees for several large railways, such as the Grand Trunk, the Great Western, and the Northern. He passed legislation which allowed Upper Canada's municipal governments to borrow money for local improvements. Unlike the government's more cautious London financial agents, Glyn Mills &amp; Co. and the Baring Brothers, Hincks correctly believed that British investors would pour capital into the colony. By 1851 Baldwin and LaFontaine, finding this speculation somewhat distasteful, retired, leaving Hincks at the helm.<br>
<br>Hincks occupied the shifting centre, opposed by Clear Grits, led by George Brown, the editor of the influential Toronto <span class="italic">Globe</span>, on the left and tories on the right. To make matters worse, he became tainted by scandal. He used his position as a public representative to further his private profit. He argued that in no case did the public lose out by such activity and that private speculation by public officials, even in areas of public policy, was in accord with much past and present practice. So it was, but Hincks, in this era of rapid change, failed to keep pace with changing perceptions of public morality, leaving his ministry open to fatal attacks.<h2>
<a name="Colonialgovernorshipsandlatercareer"></a>Colonial governorships and later career</h2>Hincks resigned in 1855, but his public career continued. The Colonial Office wished to reward colonial statesmen with imperial appointments and offered Hincks the governorship of Barbados and the Windward Islands in 1856. During his five years there he worked to better the educational and living standards of the islands' native populations. While he instituted a programme of non-sectarian education, his attempts to improve living conditions were defeated by an entrenched planter class who desired cheap labour. None the less, in 1861 England rewarded him with the governorship of British Guiana (later Guyana) and a CB. For the next eight years Hincks bickered with the colony's chief justice and with colonial businessmen known as the Bermuda clique. He did not receive a new appointment, although he did acquire a knighthood in 1869.<br>
<br>That same year Hincks became Canada's finance minister in Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservative government. The appointment angered many Conservatives, but Hincks applied his skills as a broker and financial expert to good effect. He resolved an impasse between bankers and government concerning government involvement in issuing public currency, and he allowed small banks to commence operations with a lower amount of paid-up capital. In 1874 he quit formal politics and returned to his old careers in banking, insurance, and journalism. His banking business ended in a scandal: he did not pay sufficient attention to the activities of an underling who embezzled funds, and the courts censured him for his negligence.<br>
<br>On 14 July 1875 Hincks married Emily Louisa Delatre (<i>d</i>. 1880), the widow of Robert Baldwin Sullivan. He published several partisan defences of his past politics: <span class="italic">The Political History of Canada between 1840 and 1855</span> (1877) and <span class="italic">Reminiscences of his Public Life</span> (1884). He died of smallpox in Montreal on 18 August 1885 and was buried at St Jude's Church on 19 August. After the payment of debts, he warned his executor, there would be &#145;little if any surplus&#146;  (Careless, 196) left for his heirs. He bequeathed Canada a similarly mixed legacy: railways were built, including the world's longest, the Grand Trunk, but they were not profitable. Government guarantees came due and money for such unanticipated debts proved extremely hard to find. Hincks's focus on economic development over religious and ethnic strife, however, provided a common ground on which politicians from both the Canadas could unite.<br>
