<span class="headword">Marshall,  William</span>  (1748&#150;1833), <span class="occ">composer and servant</span>, spent his life near Fochabers, Moray, where he was born on 27 December 1748, one of at least three children of Francis Marishal and his wife, Isabel Innes. At the age of twelve, after &#145;some instruction from his father&#146; and &#145;six months at a grammar-school&#146;  (MacGregor, 1), he gave up the idea of joining the army and went into service with the duke of Gordon at nearby Gordon Castle, where he advanced to head butler and house steward. He married Jean or (Jane) Giles (1740/41&#150;1825), eight years his senior, on 31 May 1773 in Fochabers. Four of their sons received commissions in the army. The deaths of Alexander (1773/4&#150;1807), John (<i>bap</i>. 1782, <i>d</i>. 1829), and George (<i>c</i>.1782/3&#150;1812) occurred during active service, while William (1779&#150;1870) lost his right arm at Waterloo but survived to die aged ninety. Francis (<i>bap</i>. 1776, <i>d</i>. before 1857) became a jeweller in London, and Jean 
    (Jane; 1778&#150;1873)
   married locally, had a large family, and died aged ninety-five years and ten months.<br>
<br>&#145;Self-taught in &hellip; mechanics and other &hellip; natural sciences&#146;  (Glen, vii) as well as on the violin, Marshall is best-known as the composer of more than 280 Scottish dance tunes for the fiddle, his two-part <span class="italic">A Collection of Strathspey Reels</span> (Edinburgh, 1781) preceding those of Niel Gow and his son Nathaniel. The tunes Marshall wrote were all based on the Scottish dance music tradition, with each one being quite short and many able to be played in less than a minute. He &#145;did not write music for bunglers&#146;  (Alburger, 84) but provided technical challenges of key and position then unusual in Scottish fiddle music. His slow airs and strathspeys (&#145;slow, when not danced&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Scottish Airs</span>, 3), reflecting a shift among his audience from dancing to listening) are still particularly influential.<br>
<br>&#145;&hellip; Above middle size, [Marshall] was compactly built, and considered handsome in his youth. In his old age he was portly and venerable &hellip; [and] particular in his dress&#146;  (MacGregor, 7). Marshall was also skilled in fishing, falconry, and shooting, and an excellent athlete. Meticulous in penmanship and speech, he was &#145;a capital dancer&#146;  (ibid., 2) and &#145;a very accurate performer &hellip; [who] stamped the instrument and semi-tones with correctness&#146;  (Grant, 2). Two of his violins and bows are in Edinburgh University's Reid Collection of Historic Musical Instruments, while a long-case clock (Fochabers Museum) and a sundial (Bourtie House, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire) show him to have been proficient in clockmaking and astronomy.<br>
<br>Marshall left Gordon Castle in 1790 after thirty years' service, ostensibly because of poor health but possibly as a punishment after he was robbed of &pound;100 17<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. belonging to the duke while in London in May 1789. Marshall spent two years farming at Burnside before being installed by the duke at his farm at Keithmore. Rehabilitation was completed when in 1794 Gordon appointed Marshall estate factor. In that post he built roads and bridges and served as a justice of the peace; the Gordons also allowed his trips to Edinburgh to work with the printers and publishers of his music. He had retired by 1823 to Newfield, a cottage he had designed and built by Craigellachie, Banffshire, where he was able to devote more time to preparing his collection <span class="italic">Marshall's Scottish Airs, Melodies, Strathspeys, Reels, &amp;c.</span>, published in Edinburgh in 1822. Marshall included a composition by the duke of Gordon in the work and was supported by other members of the Gordon family: the marchioness of Huntly ordered 700 copies for herself and her husband. <span class="italic">Volume 2nd of a Collection of Scottish Melodies, Reels, Strathspeys, Jigs, Slow Airs &amp;c.</span> was published in 1845, after Marshall's death, and enhanced his reputation for strong and characterful melodies.<br>
<br>&#145;A man of rare integrity&#146;, Marshall died at Newfield on 29 May 1833, &#145;his mental faculties &hellip; entire to the last&#146;  (MacGregor, 6). An informative tombstone marks his burial place in the parish churchyard of Bellie, in Fochabers.<br>
