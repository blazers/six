<span class="headword">Harvey,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1771, <em>d.</em> 1848), <span class="occ">writer</span>, baptized at Gateshead on 8 July 1771, was probably the daughter of William Harvey, wharfinger (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1738), and his second wife, Jane, daughter of James Marshall. According to <span class="italic">The Feminist Companion to Literature in English</span> she was the daughter of Lawrance and Elizabeth Harvey of Barnard Castle, but there seems no evidence to connect her with this place.<br>
<br>Harvey's earliest known work is <span class="italic">A Sentimental Tour through Newcastle</span>, by &#145;A Young Lady&#146;, published in 1794. This takes the form of a guide to various aspects of the city &#145;certainly in no way inferior to any provincial town in England&#146; visited by the &#145;young lady&#146;. As well as more typical sights the tour takes in the infirmary and the prison, with digressions, including political comment, on fishing and the coal trade. Her second book, <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span>, appeared in 1797.<br>
<br>Harvey continued to publish poetry throughout her life, including two collections for children&#151;<span class="italic">Sacred Hymns</span> and <span class="italic">Poems Original and Moral</span>&#151;both in 1818, but she is probably better known for her romantic novels, especially <span class="italic">The Castle of Tynemouth</span> (1806). Her books enjoyed wide currency and are represented in surviving catalogues of a number of private and circulating libraries. However, contemporary critical reaction was not always kind. The annual publication <span class="italic">The Flowers of Literature</span>, for example, says of <span class="italic">The Governor of Belleville</span> (4 vols., 1808) that &#145;there are two volumes too much of it&#146; and describes the author as &#145;lamentably deficient in the knowledge of character&#146;.<br>
<br>Little is known of Harvey's life but her obituary published in several Newcastle newspapers states that she ran a circulating library in Tynemouth for some years. At the time of her death, on 4 March 1848 in Saville Row, she was living in Brunswick Place, Newcastle upon Tyne. She was buried in the Newcastle general cemetery, at Jesmond, on 6 March. She was unmarried.<br>
