<span class="headword">Bacharach,  Alfred Louis</span>  (1891&#150;1966), <span class="occ">food scientist and musician</span>, was born in Hampstead, London, on 11 August 1891, the son of Otto Leonhard Bacharach, a stockbroker, of Hampstead, and his wife, Alice Eva Wagner. He lived throughout his life in Hampstead. Bacharach was educated at St Paul's School, where he was a foundation scholar, and at Clare College, Cambridge (1910&#150;13), where he read natural sciences. It was at Cambridge that the first of his interests, an intellectual commitment to left-wing political views, became apparent. He involved himself with the Independent Labour Party, joined the Fabian Society, and developed a concern that continued for nearly forty years with the affairs of the Working Men's College in north London. His commitment to socialist ideas was recognized during the tenure of the Labour government of 1924 by his appointment to the controlling bodies of a number of educational establishments including the Borough Polytechnic and Kynaston School.<br>
<br>Although Bacharach was deeply concerned with political theory and widely admired for his intellectual stature in this field, this was only one of his interests; many of those who came into contact with him in one sphere were only dimly aware of his other enthusiasms. His second great love was for music. He was an accomplished pianist and he gathered other musicians about him to play and talk. Out of this came the four books for which, as editor and author, his name became widely known. <span class="italic">The Musical Companion</span>, of which there was also a later edition, was first published in 1934, <span class="italic">Lives of the Great Composers</span> in 1935, <span class="italic">British Music of our Time</span> in 1946, and <span class="italic">The Music Masters</span> appeared in instalments between 1948 and 1954. These works helped to establish for Bacharach a considerable reputation as a connoisseur of music.<br>
<br>On leaving university in 1913 Bacharach worked for three years in the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories and then, for a further year, in the Wellcome Chemical Works. In 1920 he was employed by the firm of Joseph Nathan &amp; Co. Ltd, later to become the Glaxo Laboratories, where he remained for thirty-five years. At that time there were problems with artificial baby foods: even when dried cows' milk, which was imported from New Zealand, was mixed with other ingredients in order to make it resemble human milk as closely as possible, it was not uniformly satisfactory as an artificial substitute. There was, for example, the danger of rickets, caused by a lack of vitamin D. Bacharach threw himself into the study of that vitamin, one form of which, as was demonstrated by research, could be manufactured by irradiation. Bacharach attacked the problem of measuring the amount of the vitamin present both in concentrated preparations and in the mixtures in which the concentrates were incorporated. At that time the only way to do this was to administer the test substance to young rachitic rats and examine the degree to which their condition was ameliorated. Bacharach was among the first to apply rigorous statistical techniques to improve the precision of such experiments. He also introduced, at least in British practice, the use of pure-bred rats in the tests.<br>
<br>Without being a profound scientific thinker, any more than he was a great musician or a major political figure, Bacharach was a keen observer of the passing scene and an expert commentator. His agile mind was at its most sparkling in discussion, suggestion, and debate. Whether it was on the council of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, of which he became a fellow and a vice-president, as chairman of the food group of the Society of Chemical Industry, as a member of the Chemical Council or of the council of the Society of Analytical Chemistry, or as president of the Nutrition Society, which he played a part in founding and of which he was the first honorary treasurer, Bacharach could be found debating and discussing, stimulating more pedestrian colleagues to delight, despair, admiration, or exasperation. He was invariably urbane, never dull, often the catalyst bringing about the collision of ideas from which something new emerged. In 1938 he published <span class="italic">Science and Nutrition</span>; in 1941, jointly with F. A. Robinson, he produced an English translation of L&aacute;szl&oacute; Zechmeister's <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Chromatography</span>; and in 1946 he edited <span class="italic">The Nation's Food</span>.<br>
<br>There was yet a fourth strand to Bacharach's disparate interests&#151;the complement to his virtuosity as a talker. This was his passion for grammatical exactitude. He held that scientific writers, as much as any others, might from time to time benefit if their attention was drawn to syntactical order; and so unflaggingly (and in violet ink) Bacharach dealt out deserved, and good-humoured, reproof. In his later years he would visit outlying branches of the learned scientific societies to which he belonged and deliver his lecture, &#145;Writing wrongs&#146;, the principles of which guided his actions, while meting out his judgments as a member of their publications committees. In 1950 he ceased to control the nutritional laboratories at Glaxo but, as head of the publicity services group, set about improving the standard of the company's literature.<br>
<br>There are some scientists who advance knowledge by working silently in their laboratories, there are others who found businesses or build machines. Bacharach was more than a man of science, he was an outstandingly eclectic man of his time. His major contribution was to make his contemporaries think.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1931 Bacharach married Elizabeth Owen (<i>b</i>. 1902/3) and they had two sons. He died on 16 July 1966 at 26 Willow Road, Hampstead, his home for many years.<br>
