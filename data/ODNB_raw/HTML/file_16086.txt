<span class="headword">Latewar,  Richard</span>  (1559/60&#150;1601), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was the son of Thomas Latewar, a successful clothworker of London. He entered Merchant Taylors' School in 1571 and proceeded to St John's College, Oxford, on a scholarship in 1580. Latewar soon gained a high reputation as an orator, preacher, and poet. One auditor praised him as a &#145;poet lawreat&#146; as early as January 1582  (Donno, 73). He became a fellow of St John's in 1583 and graduated BA on 28 November 1584. In 1586 he composed a Latin poem in commemoration of Sir Thomas White, founder of St John's, which the college paid to have printed in gold letters for display, and the next year he made substantial contributions to Oxford's <span class="italic">Exequiae</span> for Sir Philip Sidney, edited by his friend William Gager. Latewar also contributed verses to three books of commentary on Aristotle by John Case and wrote a play, <span class="italic">Philotas</span>, which (according to Samuel Daniel) won much praise when it was performed at St John's. On 23 May 1588 he proceeded MA. When Queen Elizabeth visited Oxford in September 1592 Latewar was apparently one of the scholars chosen for a public disputation of moral philosophy.<br>
<br>Having served as a university proctor in 1593/4 and proceeded BD on 2 July 1594, Latewar joined his friend John Buckeridge in preaching away from Oxford. The two men later incepted as DD on the same day, 5 February 1597, and the books which Latewar gave to his college suggest that he shared similar theological views to Buckeridge. As a theologian Latewar was sufficiently well regarded for Oxford to nominate him (unsuccessfully) for the inaugural divinity lectureship at Gresham College in February 1597. By 1595 Buckeridge was a chaplain to the earl of Essex and Latewar himself was clearly associated with those scholars at Oxford who looked to the earl's patronage. One of his few surviving poems in English is a riposte to &#145;The Lie&#146;, a poem written by Essex's sometime rival Sir Walter Ralegh. Latewar apparently became a chaplain to Essex's friend, Lord Mountjoy, by August 1596, when Mountjoy secured him the rectory of Hopton, Suffolk. Three years later Mountjoy helped him win the richer living of Finchley, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Latewar served as vice-president of his college in 1597/8 but left Oxford in December 1599 when Mountjoy was appointed lord deputy of Ireland and given the task of crushing Tyrone's rebellion. His colleagues at St John's voted him 20 marks &#145;with a fellow feeling much tendering the state of our said fellow drawen by his love and dewtye to his L[ord] into so daingerouse and yet necessary service&#146;  (Costin, 14). Mountjoy and his entourage arrived in Ireland to begin their long campaign two months later. On 16 July 1601, during a minor skirmish at Benburb, Latewar ventured too close to the action and received a mortal gunshot wound to his head. He died the next day, aged forty-one, and was buried on 20 July at Armagh Cathedral. A monument for him was erected by his father in the chapel of St John's in 1604, for which the college paid the costs of installation. The inscription, punning on his name, memorializes Latewar's renown as a scholar and poet.<br>
