<span class="headword">Elliot, Sir  Thomas Frederick</span>  (1808&#150;1880), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in London in July 1808 and baptized on 29 January 1809  (<span class="italic">IGI</span>), the youngest son of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8664/', "Hugh Elliot (1752&#150;1830)")</script>, diplomat, and his second wife, Margaret Jones (1770&#150;1819). Elliot belonged to a titled Scottish family with extensive whig connections and a long tradition of public service. His father was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8660/', "Sir Gilbert Elliot, third baronet (1722&#150;1777)")</script>, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8661/', "Gilbert Elliot Murray Kynynmound, first earl of Minto (1751&#150;1814)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8656/', "Sir Charles Elliot (1801&#150;1875)")</script> was his own younger brother. Elliot spent six years in India following his father's appointment as governor of Madras in 1814, and considered himself fortunate to have experienced the contrasts of India and England at such a young age, believing it had taught him &#145;liberality&#146;. He was educated at Harrow School (1821&#150;5), where he found school life tedious and complained that he learned very little.<br>
<br>On the strength of his family connections and traditions Elliot entered the Colonial Office as a junior clerk on 5 July 1825. His administrative ability was soon rewarded by promotion to the position of pr&eacute;cis writer in July 1827. From June 1831 he served as secretary to the newly appointed emigration commissioners, whose brief was to assist and diffuse information to prospective emigrants to the Australian and British North American colonies. James Stephen, permanent counsel to the Colonial Office and later permanent under-secretary of state, drew attention to Elliot's aptitude and considered his advancement to be of &#145;national importance&#146;  (Grey MSS, GRE/B126/11). Upon the dismissal of the commissioners in August 1832 he was given sole responsibility for superintendence of emigration schemes to Australia. He worked closely with the London Emigration Committee, a philanthropic body which managed the practical arrangements of emigration on behalf of the Colonial Office. In April 1833 he achieved further promotion as senior clerk to the North American department. This relatively rapid progress displeased some of his longer-serving, less adept colleagues. On 16 May 1833 he married Jane Perry (1807&#150;1861), daughter of James Perry (1756&#150;1821), the former proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. They had no children. From 1835 to 1837 he served in Quebec as secretary to the earl of Gosford's commission of inquiry into Canadian affairs, where his contribution did not go unnoticed. Elliot's private correspondence to a colleague, Henry Taylor, discussing the state of affairs in Canada was forwarded to Viscount Howick, secretary at war, who, impressed by the quality of his analysis, circulated his letters to the cabinet. Despite the failure of the Gosford commission, Elliot's reputation was undoubtedly enhanced. He published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Canadian Controversy: its Origin, Nature, and Merits</span> (1838), which was essentially a defence of the government's policy.<br>
<br>Elliot returned to England in March 1837 to take up the new post of agent-general for emigration, created to manage the bureaucratic framework for government-assisted emigration to Australia. Working with only a small staff, he had to undertake many of the more mundane duties himself, but did so with enthusiasm and commitment. In January 1840 he was appointed one of three commissioners of the newly established colonial land and emigration commission, and subsequently became its chairman. Through these areas of responsibility he achieved significant and enduring influence over emigration policies for Australia. In his attempts to rationalize and organize the process of emigration, he demonstrated a keen awareness of the diverse problems and issues surrounding colonization. He took particular satisfaction in contributing to legislation for the health and safety of ship passengers, which culminated in the <span class="roman">Passenger Act</span> of 1855. His paternalistic concern for the humanitarian aspects of emigration was evident, but he rarely allowed these considerations to preclude stringently applying the criteria for selecting assisted emigrants. He always acknowledged the importance of balancing British domestic needs against colonial preferences. Wherever possible he tried to adhere to free-trade doctrines, particularly in his dealings with shipowners, where he was reluctant to interfere too much in matters which might affect the cost of passages for emigrants.<br>
<br>Criticism of Elliot's handling of emigration was unremitting and at times severe. Colonies complained about the quality of immigrants they received; shipowners worried about the increasingly restrictive passenger regulations, and some colonial reformers, such as Edward Gibbon Wakefield, condemned Elliot as being unfit for the business of colonization. Elliot patiently but firmly defended his actions and policies. In November 1847, following the retirement of James Stephen, Elliot became one of two assistant under-secretaries of state under Stephen's successor, Herman Merivale. This new appointment allowed him to maintain his interest and influence in Australian affairs such as emigration, transportation, and self-government, and also involved him in such diverse issues as colonial military expenditure and Canadian confederation. He was a major witness before the select committee of the House of Lords on emigration from Ireland in 1848.<br>
<br>Family connections secured Elliot's acceptance into the exclusive circles of London society, where he met those with influence in colonial affairs. He moved within the circle of philosophical radicals, colonial reformers, celebrated writers, literati, and liberal politicians such as Lord John Russell, whose second wife, Frances, was Elliot's second cousin. His house at 13 Chesham Place, London, was described as where &#145;most of the persons who, in those days, were writing and reading and making speeches&#146; met together  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers of &hellip; Thackeray</span>, 1.cxxvii). His lively wit and personable qualities made him a popular figure. Elliot enjoyed long-standing friendships with John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle, and helped to organize the latter's series of lectures in 1837. William Makepeace Thackeray declared the Elliot home to be one of his favourite places. Following his wife's death, on 9 January 1861, Elliot moved out of Chesham Place and was seen less frequently at social gatherings.<br>
<br>Elliot's retirement, with a pension, from the Colonial Office on 8 December 1868 was prompted by his forthcoming second marriage, on 4 January 1869, to Elizabeth Howe Bromley (1824?&#150;1880), daughter of Sir Robert Howe Bromley (1778&#150;1857) and Anne Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1873). There were no children from this marriage. On 14 August 1869 he was appointed KCMG for his long service in colonial affairs. After his retirement he indulged his love of travel and pursued his interest in science. Michael Faraday's work, both scientific and metaphysical, held a particular fascination for him. He published privately a satirical essay entitled <span class="italic">A Discourse on Table Rapping</span> and circulated it among family and friends. He was elected vice-president of the Royal Institution of Great Britain in July 1876. He died at Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, Egypt, on 12 February 1880, four days after the death of his second wife. Both were victims of an acute infection, diagnosed as typhoid fever, and were buried in Cairo. Elliot is representative of the &#145;powerful&#146; nineteenth-century civil servant (others include Edwin Chadwick, Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, and Sir Charles Trevelyan) who lived through the transition from a civil service characterized by jobbery and family connection to one whose progress was based on merit and ability.<br>
