<span class="headword">Bartley, Sir  George Christopher Trout</span>  (1842&#150;1910), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born at Rectory Place, Hackney, on 22 November 1842, the son of Robert Bartley, of the War Office and his second wife, Julia Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas. After early education at Blackheath, at Clapton, and at University College School, London, he became, in 1860, science examiner at the education branch of the Department of Science and Art in South Kensington, under <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5852/', "Sir Henry Cole")</script>. In 1864 he married Mary Charlotte, Cole's third daughter. They had four sons and one daughter. In 1866 he was made official examiner, and remained there until 1880 as assistant director of the science division, which was responsible for the establishment of science schools throughout the country.<br>
<br>Since 1870 Bartley had written several pamphlets on social questions, especially on thrift and poor law and on education. His first published work, <span class="italic">The Educational Condition and Requirements of one Square Mile in the East End of London</span> (1870) was quoted by William Edward Forster during the discussion of the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1870. In 1871 there followed <span class="italic">Schools for the People</span>, which treated of the historical development and methods of schools for the working classes in England, and, with Emily Shirreff, he edited the journal of the Women's Educational Union, which aimed at the general improvement of women's education.<br>
<br>Poverty and the harsh effects of the existing poor law system also claimed his attention and in a series of pamphlets he urged its reform. In 1872 he read a paper before the Society of Arts on old-age pensions, urging that help should be given in old age to those who had made some provision for themselves. Twenty-one years later he laid before the House of Commons a bill for old-age pensions, which embodied his earlier principles. For the encouragement of thrift among the masses he published in 1872 twelve penny &#145;Provident Knowledge Papers&#146;, which he supplemented with other homilies on the same theme. In 1872 he started the instalment club at 77 Church Street, Edgware Road, London, which enabled workmen to buy tools or clothes by regular weekly payments. The foundation of the Middlesex Penny Bank at the same address followed the same year. In 1875, in conjunction with Sir Henry Cole, the duke of Devonshire, H. N. Hamilton Hoare and others, Bartley established the National Penny Bank, so-called because the minimum deposit was 1<i>d</i>. To encourage thrift, collectors were authorized to take deposits at many workplaces, such as the London docks and schools; other local branches were open in the evenings for the workmen's convenience. The scheme was a great success. By the year of Bartley's death over 2,800,000 accounts had been opened and some &pound;25 million had passed through the bank.<br>
<br>In 1880 Bartley resigned his post at South Kensington to stand for parliament in the Conservative interest. He unsuccessfully opposed Henry Fawcett at Hackney in March of that year. From 1883 to 1885 he was chief agent to the Conservative Party. In 1885 he was returned for North Islington, and retained that seat until 1906. He was narrowly defeated in November 1907 at a by-election in West Hull. In the House of Commons Bartley, although a fluent speaker, strenuously advocated the curtailment of parliamentary speeches; in 1891 he voted against his party in opposition to the <span class="roman">Free Education Bill</span> brought in by the Salisbury government, and he played a prominent part in obstructing the chief measures of the Liberal government (1892&#150;5). Bartley was created KCB in November 1902, and served as a JP for London and Middlesex.<br>
<br>He died at Henrietta House, 14 Henrietta Street, London, on 13 September 1910 after an operation, and was buried in Holtye churchyard, near Shovelstrode Manor, East Grinstead, his country house. He was survived by his wife and by his four sons and his daughter. His second son, Douglas Cole Bartley, barrister, succeeded him as managing director of the National Penny Bank.<br>
