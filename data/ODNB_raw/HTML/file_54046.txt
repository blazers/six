<span class="headword">Rudd <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Youngson]</span>,  Margaret Caroline</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1745, <em>d.</em> in or before 1798?), <span class="occ">courtesan and accused forger</span>, was born in Lurgan, co. Armagh. Much was written of her life and exploits but little can be verified. Her father, Patrick Youngson, was reported to have been an apothecary; her mother, Marjorie Stewart, was said to be the illegitimate child of a local landowner and linen merchant, John Stewart. Some accounts say that she was orphaned early and raised by her maternal uncle, the legitimate son of her mother's father. All agreed that she went to a boarding-school at Downpatrick, where she evinced both academic and flirtatious talents. At seventeen, she met and soon married Valentine Rudd, a young soldier, in Ireland as a recruiting officer. After leaving Ireland for England, the two soon spent Rudd's small patrimony, and, gossip had it, when the money was gone Mrs Rudd eloped with another young military man who was lodger in the house in which they lived.<br>
<br>It is unclear how and with whom Mrs Rudd spent the next several years; after her rise to fame many stories were told of this time, most of them improbable. It is likely that she set up as a courtesan, or &#145;demirep&#146;, of fashion, and, for a while at least, lived with Joseph Salvadore, an important international trader and merchant. In 1770 she met and soon began living with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65814/', "Daniel Perreau (c.1734&#150;1776)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65813/', "Perreau, Robert")</script>], a bankrupt West Indies merchant and stock speculator of Huguenot descent. By 1775 they had had three children, and Mrs Rudd passed in the world as Mrs Daniel Perreau.<br>
<br>When, in March 1775, Daniel's identical twin brother, Robert Perreau, a well-established and trusted London apothecary, was found to have attempted to secure a bank loan on the basis of a forged bond, Mrs Rudd was soon implicated, and in fact denounced by both brothers, as the mastermind behind the plan. It emerged that a much more complex series of similar forgeries had occurred. When brought before the magistrates, Mrs Rudd asked for, and was granted, immunity from prosecution in order to testify against the brothers. Since forgery was a capital offence, such immunity was a valuable acquisition. Though the brothers were tried and found guilty, Mrs Rudd neither testified nor was dismissed after their trial. Instead, a case was brought against her, for, it was argued, she had been improperly given protection and was herself responsible for the crimes, of which the brothers were innocent dupes.<br>
<br>The brothers' executions were delayed while the judges pondered these issues. Throughout this period public interest was intense, and a prolific newspaper discussion occurred over who was to blame and what was to be done. The case provided the public with the opportunity to discuss the nature and workings of the law in general, and to consider the propriety of the magistrates' powers, the role of judges, and of capital punishment itself. Several months later, for what may have been the first time in Britain, a witness's immunity was withdrawn, and Mrs Rudd put on trial. The jury returned a most peculiar verdict, that on the basis of the evidence put before them, she was not guilty. The brothers' fate was sealed. After their executions Mrs Rudd was reported to have become the mistress of the rakish <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17310/', "Thomas Lyttelton, second Baron Lyttelton (1744&#150;1779)")</script>, and then disappeared from public view until the 1780s. With the publication of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2950/', "James Boswell's")</script> journals, however, it is now known that she and Boswell had become acquainted shortly after the case, and that Mrs Rudd had become his mistress for some time in the mid-1780s. She briefly surfaced with the publication of a tract denouncing Lord Rawdon for his perfidy in withdrawing support from a needy member of his family, herself, and for a novel, <span class="italic">The Victim of Prejudice</span>. The press reported her death at different times, though Valentine Rudd remarried in 1798, so she may have been dead by then.<br>
<br>Contemporaries found Mrs Rudd's case fascinating and troubling in a series of ways. A woman of very feminine mien, it was said she possessed a &#145;masculine&#146; understanding and a vigorous, sarcastic pen. Her self-defence in the press was one of the first times that a woman had written so prolifically on her own behalf under her own name. Claiming to be of aristocratic lineage and to be a much-wronged wife, she used the rhetoric of female weakness and sensibility to move the hearts and change the minds of the public. But to many she seemed to be a Circe, using and discarding men to satisfy her desires for self-promotion and material advancement. She seemed in many ways to embody both the allure and the risks of commercial credit, and to exemplify the untrustworthiness of appearance as well as the dangers of both personal and fiscal impersonation and forgery in an age of capitalism and revolution.<br>
