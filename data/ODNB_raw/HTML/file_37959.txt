<span class="headword">Simmonds <span class="st"> [Simmons; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Calvert]</span>,  Martha</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">Quaker and author</span>, was baptized at Meare, Somerset, on 28 January 1624, the daughter of George Calvert (<i>d</i>. 1628), vicar of Meare, and his second wife, Ann Collier; she was the younger sister of the booksellers George and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39669/', "Giles Calvert")</script>. Giles's shop at the Black Spread Eagle in St Paul's Churchyard, London, was the leading outlet for the works of early Quakers until 1656. Although perhaps a Seeker from about 1640 Martha was an early convert to Quakerism about 1654&#150;5, writing several pamphlets, three of which were published by her brother Giles: <span class="italic">When the Lord Jesus Came to Jerusalem</span> (April 1655); <span class="italic">A Lamentation for the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel</span> (October 1655); and <span class="italic">O England, thy Time is Come</span> [n.d., <i>c</i>.1656&#150;7]. The first two were printed together in a second edition of <span class="italic">A Lamentation</span> (1656).<br>
<br>At the time of her conversion Martha had been living in London since probably the 1640s (most likely at her brother's shop) and in <span class="italic">A Lamentation</span> she describes many years of spiritual seeking. About 1655 she married Thomas Simmons or Simmonds (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1618) who had recently returned to London after several years as a bookseller in Birmingham. In March 1655 the Quakers established the Bull and Mouth as their main London meeting place, where Thomas opened his bookshop; he became their principal publisher the following year. During his Birmingham years he had connections with George Calvert, and Giles Calvert may have supported the London venture as an extension of his own Quaker publishing. Martha, however, soon left London for Essex. By December 1655 she had been imprisoned several times in Colchester for interrupting church services and enacting signs, and walking through the town in sackcloth and ashes. She also visited Ware and Hertford and in <span class="italic">O England</span> writes of almost two years spent in crying repentance &#145;in thy Cities, Towns, and Market-Streets&#146;  (1&#150;2).<br>
<br>Martha's part in the events of summer 1656 has been variously interpreted as female hysteria, witchcraft, or a challenge to male Quaker leadership. A group of women including Martha began in 1656 to interrupt Quaker meetings led by Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough, singing and chanting &#145;innocency&#146;. The women, condemned by Burrough, William Dewsbury, and Richard Hubberthorn, turned to James Nayler for justice. Martha's powerful appeal triggered a spiritual crisis in Nayler, who stayed at her house for three days, an episode leading to accusations by George Fox of witchcraft. In July, Friends tried to part Nayler and Martha forcibly by taking him to Bristol, though George Bishop later denied her account of being thrown downstairs. Nayler proceeded towards Exeter, where shortly afterwards he was imprisoned, while Martha returned to London and offered herself as nurse to Major-General John Desborough's wife, a sister of Cromwell. As reward for her services she obtained an order for Nayler's release which, with her husband and Hannah and John Stranger, she delivered to Exeter in October.<br>
<br>Now began the series of events which would culminate in Nayler's trial for blasphemy, Martha's ostracism by London Friends, and serious damage to the reputation of the Quaker movement. While Thomas Simmons returned to London, the rest of the Exeter group&#151;Nayler, Martha, Hannah and John Stranger, Dorcas Erbury, Timothy Wedlock, Samuel Carter, and Robert Crab&#151;set off for Bristol, passing in procession through Wells and Glastonbury where they strewed the way with their garments. On 24 October they reached Bristol, entering the city in what many interpreted as a blasphemous re-enactment of Christ's entry into Jerusalem: the men went bareheaded, Nayler riding on horseback while Martha and Hannah walked at either side, singing &#145;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Israel&#146;. Ending their procession at the city's high cross they then met local Friends at the White Hart, whereupon they were immediately arrested, imprisoned, and questioned by Bristol magistrates. Martha's testimony that her actions were inspired by the Lord and that &#145;James Nayler will be Jesus, when the new life is born in him&#146; confirmed suspicions of Nayler's blasphemy  (Deacon, 27). A letter to Martha from her husband laments the rashness of the group's actions at Bristol: &#145;If there was such a glory amongst you; why were you not silent, and have let the people cry Hosanna&#146;. His suggestion that Martha was &#145;the chief leader in that action&#146; is suggestive: Martha's preoccupation with the biblical episode of Christ's entry is clear from her first publication. Thomas's postscript offers an analogy with the Levellers: &#145;part of the Army that fell at Burford, was your figure&#146;  (Farmer, 21).<br>
<br>News of the incident quickly spread and a parliamentary committee, set up on 31 October to consider Nayler's misdemeanours and blasphemies, sent for the prisoners; they left Bristol for London on 10 November. Nayler was found guilty of blasphemy and after debate the committee rejected the death penalty. On his first appearance in the pillory, on 18 December, he was whipped 300 times. Protests at this brutality included a petition to parliament that his next punishment be postponed; the only stationer who signed was Giles Calvert, Martha's brother. On 27 December, when Nayler's tongue was bored and his forehead branded, Martha, Hannah Stranger and Dorcas Erbury sat at the foot of the pillory in a tableau recalling the three Marys at the foot of the cross, while Robert Rich put up a sign reading &#145;This is the King of the Jews&#146; above Nayler's head. The following day a sympathetic and noisy Quaker demonstration gathered at the Rose in the new market place, Westminster, where Martha and the other women were in custody.<br>
<br>A report that Martha, the Strangers, and Dorcas Erbury, still undischarged and under custody, went to Westminster Abbey and listened quietly to sermons seems unreliable. <span class="italic">O England</span> (with texts by Martha, Nayler, Hannah Stranger, and William Tomlinson) is defiantly celebratory of Nayler's Christ-like suffering, and letters from Friends indicate that, with Nayler imprisoned in Bridewell, the women continued to disrupt Quaker meetings. On one occasion Martha and Mildred Crouch sang a psalm, read from <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> and performed a parodic communion. In April 1657 they attempted reconciliation with the Quaker movement: &#145;The Agents of J[ames] N[ayler] have come creeping on their Bellies to be owned yea: Martha their Miserable Mother, this day hath been [at?] us, &amp; all her witchery &amp; filthy enchantments is set at Naught&#146;  (Swarthmore MS 5.27). The group probably fragmented for, in August, Salisbury Friends &#145;received some hurt by some of Martha Simmonds company which came there about to dwell&#146;  (Swarthmore MS 2.129). By autumn Hubberthorne detected &#145;something of God stirring&#146; in Martha  (Caton MS 3.391). Although Thomas Simmons continued publishing for Quakers until 1661, Giles Calvert thereafter published few Quaker authors other than Nayler. The exact details of Martha's death in 1665 are unclear: a letter of 7 April 1665 reports her death <i>en route</i> for Maryland but her death in St Mary Magdalen's parish, Bermondsey, on 27 September 1665 and burial the same day in Southwark are also recorded.<br>
