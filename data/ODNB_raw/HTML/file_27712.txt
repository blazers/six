<span class="headword">Tresham, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1543&#150;1605), <span class="occ">gentleman and recusant</span>, was the son of John Tresham (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1546) and Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1546), daughter of Anthony Catesby of Whiston. Born in September 1543, Thomas became heir at the age of three to the Northamptonshire estates of his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27711/', "Sir Thomas Tresham (d. 1559)")</script>. As ward of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, Warwickshire, whose daughter Meriel (<i>d</i>. 1615) he later married (1566), a religiously conservative upbringing was likely. It was unobtrusive enough, however, for him&#151;after study at the Middle Temple from 1560 to 1568 (Edmund Plowden's inn, and notoriously Catholic)&#151;to become sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1573 and to be knighted at Elizabeth I's visit to Kenilworth in 1575. He was, however, implicated in an assault on an anti-Catholic informer at Kettering in 1576. Robert Persons said he received Tresham into the Roman Catholic church in 1580. If &#145;scarcely more than a formality&#146;  (Anstruther, 112), this moved Tresham to open rejection of the Elizabethan church&#151;until 1578 he was still having his children baptized in the parish church, but not Thomas in 1580.<br>
<br>In 1580 Tresham received the Jesuit Edmund Campion at his house at Hoxton, Middlesex; taken before the privy council and then Star Chamber after Campion's capture the following year, Tresham refused to answer under oath to questions tending to self-incrimination. This began his long career of fines and imprisonment: in 1581&#150;3 in the Fleet prison, then under house arrest at Hoxton (1583&#150;7, 1589&#150;93), except for the tense period of 1587&#150;8, when he was committed again. Finally he was sent to his Northamptonshire house at Rushton, which had the disadvantage that his resort to London for legal and financial business required privy council permission. As a final insult, just as recusants began to enjoy greater liberty, Tresham was subjected to legal harassment (leading to further imprisonment) by the ungrateful Catholic family of his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28165/', "William Vaux, Lord Vaux of Harrowden")</script>, after the latter died in 1595, leaving his intractable financial embarrassments for Tresham to attempt to disentangle.<br>
<br>Tresham became spokesman for lay Catholic loyalism, disavowing that temporal obedience to the crown was compromised by obligations of spiritual obedience to the pope. He was probably associated with a petition to this effect in 1583 and certainly with one in 1585. In 1588 he deplored the denial to Catholic gentlemen of their natural right to defend their sovereign; if not trusted with a weapon, he offered to do so unarmed. Such Catholic loyalism was potentially divisive enough for the government apparently to encourage reports that Jesuits &#145;regarded him as an atheist&#146;  (Renold, 255). But it can be overstated: &#145;beneath the florid and high-flown prose through which Tresham expressed his obedience was a critique of a government consistently and systematically overstepping its bounds&#146;  (Kaushik, 52), from his 1581 arrest onwards.<br>
<br>Despite Tresham's protestations, some of his papers indicate a preference for the dynastic claim of James I, whose accession he hurried to proclaim at Northampton, despite heckling about the pope. He received a promise of an end to recusancy fines and was given a commission for forests&#151;but the first was vitiated by recusants' resort to the Bye plot and their proposal to make Tresham lieutenant of the Tower; the second did not survive complaints about a tactless two-hour &#145;discourse&#146; to which he subjected his fellows when accused of harsh estate management. Certainly his estates were a particular target for enclosure rioters. Financial problems did not eliminate traditional gentry pursuits, other than public office. From 1593 he substantially remodelled both his Northamptonshire houses, Rushton and Lyveden, building with an &#145;almost frightening &hellip; intensity&#146;  (Airs, 22), though spending a relatively modest &pound;970 in seven years. His individual house and garden designs, embodying Catholic religious symbolism&#151;most notably in the remarkable triangular lodge at Rushton (1593&#150;7)&#151;have continued to attract interest, leading to the establishment of a Tresham trail. A Northamptonshire institute of further and higher education has also been named after him.<br>
<br>Tresham died at Rushton Hall after a painful illness on 11 September 1605 and was buried at St Peter's, Rushton, &#145;the foremost Catholic layman of the old school&#146;  (Anstruther, 277)&#151;too old school for the conspiratorial antics of his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27708/', "Francis Tresham")</script>, which ensured the latter survived him by only three months. Sir Thomas Tresham was long cited as the archetypal gentleman ruined by recusancy fines, but this has now been refuted. He was &pound;11,500 in debt at his death, and had &pound;3000 of debts even in 1582. Having paid &pound;7720 for recusancy clearly contributed to the increase, but not as much as his &pound;12,200 spent on marriage portions for six daughters married ambitiously, notably to Catholic peers including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21345/', "William Parker, Lord Morley")</script>. Over &pound;3000 in bribes and fines had gone in 1601 to buy the life of Tresham's son Francis after the Essex rising. Despite an aggressive and far from conservative estate policy, increasing his income to perhaps &pound;3500 p.a., he had failed to economize sufficiently to fund his recusancy. It was his younger son, Sir Lewis Tresham, bt (1578&#150;1639), who succeeded in decisively dissipating the family fortune.<br>
