<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rowe,  Arthur</span>  (1936&#150;2003), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born on 17 August 1936 at 12 Long Row, Smithies, near Barnsley, Yorkshire, the son of Arthur Rowe, a colliery worker, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Traviss. After leaving school at fifteen he became an apprentice blacksmith, a job which helped develop his renowned upper body strength. He was a keen sportsman who played full-back in the reserve team of Rotherham United and who also enjoyed swimming and cricket.<br>
<br>In 1954, when waiting to bat for a local youth cricket team, Rowe chanced on a group of trainee shotputters and, challenged to have a go, threw the shot ten feet further than any of them, while still wearing his pads. He was hooked. He practised at night after work, hurling the weight along the tarmac under the local street lamps. His potential was brought to the attention of the national coach Geoff Dyson, who advised him to begin weight-training and join the Doncaster Plant Works athletic club, where he would receive specialist training. Under Dyson's tutelage Rowe developed his fine technique and explosiveness across the throwing circle. He won his first Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) title in 1958, followed in the same year by the European shot putt championship in Stockholm and the gold medal at the empire and Commonwealth games in Cardiff. These achievements led him to become the first field event performer to win the AAA's athlete of the year award.<br>
<br>After his empire and European titles Rowe's employers at North Gawber colliery allowed him liberal time off on full pay and also provided him with a weight-training shed at his home. He also capitalized on his celebrity by becoming a &#145;shamateur&#146;, often avoiding major athletics meetings to secure appearance money at gala days and the like. He later remarked that &#145;maybe if you have gone to Eton or Oxford, you can afford to turn down such offers, but if, like me, you haven't got the brass, you take backhanders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>). It is perhaps significant that he compared an Olympic gold medal to winning &pound;200,000 on the football pools. It was widely anticipated that he would be on the podium at the Rome Olympics of 1960, but the Italian heat and a stomach upset attributed to nerves meant that he did not even qualify for the final. His initial reaction was to quit the sport but the following year he was undefeated in all competitions and raised the British, European, and Commonwealth records to 19.56 metres, which ranked him third in the world.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1961, at St Mary's Church, Lundwood, Barnsley, Rowe married a comptometer operator, Betty Lovery, daughter of James Lovery, a surface worker at a local pit. They had two daughters, Stephanie and Louise, and a son, Steven. Abruptly in July 1962 Rowe turned to professional rugby. As many British athletes of the time found, representing their country did not bring significant economic reward. In contrast his signing-on fee for Oldham produced enough money to buy a house and a new car, and still leave some in the bank. Nevertheless his sojourn in rugby league was brief. He wanted to use his speed in the backs; his employers wanted him to use his strength in the forwards.<br>
<br>After quitting rugby Rowe could not return to amateur athletics as the rules of the time, rigidly enforced by the AAA administrators, forbade a professional in any sport from competing as an amateur in track and field. He established Honeywell Building, a construction company in Barnsley, but was soon attracted to athletics in Scotland, where the highland games offered reasonable prize money and the big men of the heavy events rather than the track athletes were the stars. The organizers hit on the idea of gaining publicity (and of providing some serious competition for Bill Anderson) by inviting the Yorkshireman to compete. In his first games, at Aboyne in September 1962, wearing the mandatory kilt, which he borrowed from a fellow competitor, he even entered the long jump, in which he came fourth, with a jump of 18 ft 11&frac34; in. As in his shot putting he relied on technique as well as strength, and at the Braemar games of 1963 he smashed four records in a day, including throwing the 56 pound weight over a bar 14 ft 2 in. high. He also mastered the art of caber tossing, becoming &#145;world champion&#146; at the Aberdeen games in 1968 and retaining the title the following year. His jousts with his Scottish rival Anderson enlivened the circuit for almost a decade. He continued to compete north of the border until 1977, after which he concentrated on his construction work. He died in Barnsley General Hospital on 13 September 2003, twelve months after being diagnosed as suffering from bladder cancer. He was survived by his wife, Betty, and their three children. More than forty years after quitting the sport he was still ranked eighth on the all-time British shot putt list.<br>
