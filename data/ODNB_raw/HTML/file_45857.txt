<span class="headword">Mosse <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rouviere]</span>,  Henrietta</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in Ireland. Nothing is known of her early life or education. Her first novel, <span class="italic">Lussington Abbey</span> was published anonymously by the Minerva Press in 1804. On 4 December 1806 at St Marylebone in London she married Isaac Mosse (1766/7&#150;1828), businessman and author of <span class="italic">Enclytica, Being the Outlines of a Course of Instruction on the Principles of Universal Grammar</span> (1814). She continued to write for Minerva after her marriage, publishing under her own name. Several novels appeared in quick succession, including the well-received <span class="italic">Heirs of Villeroy</span> (1806); <span class="italic">A Peep at our Ancestors</span> (1807), a historical novel set in the twelfth century; and <span class="italic">The Old Irish Baronet, or, The Manners of my Country</span> (1808), modelled on Clara Reeve's successful Gothic novel, <span class="italic">The Old English Baron</span> (1788). <span class="italic">A Peep at our Ancestors</span> was allegedly based on &#145;records and documents&#146;, but despite the author's claim to have written a &#145;correct&#146; sketch of the times, its &#145;peep&#146; into history is thinly disguised contemporary romance. This novel is graced by a frontispiece engraved portrait of Mosse by H. R. Cook after Ramsey, a dedication to the duke of Leinster, and subscribers list. In 1812 <span class="italic">Arrivals from India, or, Time's a Great Master</span> was published, with a dedication to Princess Mary. Henrietta Mosse's reputation was that of the skilled Minerva veteran, writing highly marketable novels of indifferent quality, containing &#145;nothing to condemn, and certainly nothing very much to commend&#146;. The formulas she deployed differed little from other romance writers, &#145;with this exception that the fair author keeps in mind the good old moral of virtue rewarded, and vice punished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>). In 1816 she published <span class="italic">Craigh-Melrose Priory, or, Memoirs of the Mount Linton Family</span>, translated into French the following year. <span class="italic">A Bride and No Wife</span> appeared in 1817, with intermittent translation work from French to English.<br>
<br>The 1820s began badly, with Isaac Mosse swindled in business and paralysed by a series of strokes from 1822. Nursing her husband single-handedly, Mosse published at least four novels between 1825 and 1829: <span class="italic">A Father's Love and a Woman's Friendship</span> (1825), <span class="italic">Gratitude and other Tales</span> (1826), <span class="italic">Woman's Wit and Man's Wisdom, or, Intrigue</span> (1827), and <span class="italic">The Blandfords, or, Fate and Fortune</span> (1829) with assistance from her &#145;benevolent Patroness&#146;, Marchioness Cornwallis. With times bad for all and a deepening sense that &#145;authorship is become a very doubtful source for existence&#146;, Mosse advertised for non-literary work, trying to rally her &#145;power to exert [herself]&#146; and her innate &#145;high spirit&#146;. The Royal Literary Fund was relatively generous while Isaac Mosse lived and granted his widow &pound;20 in 1828 after an affecting appeal &#145;from the side of his coffin&#146;. All previous petitions were based on her husband's single published work, and in 1830 Mosse was obliged to appeal for the first time as author in her own right, staking her claim on past publications and several works in hand: three volumes of &#145;moral and entertaining tales founded on fact&#146;, a work entitled &#145;The distress of women&#146;, and several dramas, &#145;highly spoken of by the Principals of one or two theatres&#146;. Nevertheless, she despaired of ever seeing them performed, confessing that she felt constrained by lack of &#145;that energetic principle to urge them forwards&#146; which &#145;cannot properly belong to the female character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archives of the Royal Literary Fund</span>, reel 16).<br>
<br>The Royal Literary Fund archive charts a harrowing career up until 1834, when Mosse died &#145;in a state of great destitution in a miserable attic&#146; at 6 Somers Town Terrace, London. W. Jones of 36 Judd Street, the doctor who tended her in her final illness, appealed to the Royal Literary Fund for aid for a decent burial, but his request was ruled &#145;inadmissible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archives of the Royal Literary Fund</span>, reel 16).<br>
