<span class="headword">Cobham,  Thomas</span>  (1779/1786&#150;1842), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London. His father, who was &#145;distinguished as an algebraist, mathematician, and architectural draughtsman&#146;, died young, and Cobham was apprenticed by his mother to his cousin Joseph Aspin, an eminent printer. He rose to be reader and corrector for the press, and became acquainted with Edmond Malone, an edition of whose works of Shakespeare he read for the printers.<br>
<br>Cobham first appeared as an amateur in Lamb's Conduit Street as Shylock, a part in which George Frederick Cooke had greatly impressed him. His first professional performance was at Watford, Hertfordshire. Thereafter he played in various provincial towns, taking, like Edmund Kean, every part, from leading tragedian to harlequin. At Salisbury he married a Miss Drake, an actress at the city's theatre. When playing at Oxford, Cobham, with his wife, was engaged by William Penley for the theatre in Tottenham Street, London, where he appeared with much success as Marmion in a dramatization by William Oxberry of Scott's poem. He then went to the Surrey Theatre, and thence to the Royalty. About this time he became known as &#145;the Kemble of the minor theatres&#146;.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1816 Cobham appeared as Richard III at Covent Garden. That the experiment was a failure was in part ascribed to the supporters of Kean, and especially to the club known as &#145;the Wolves&#146;. Hazlitt, however, who was present on the occasion, declared his Richard to have been &#145;a vile one&#146;, a caricature of Kean, and continued:<blockquote>He raved, whined, grinned, stared, stamped, and rolled his eyes with incredible velocity, and all in the right place according to his cue, but in so extravagant and disjointed a manner, and with such a total want of common sense, decorum, or conception of the character as to be perfectly ridiculous. (<span class="italic">A View of the English Stage</span>, 1818, 274)</blockquote>The <span class="italic">Theatrical Inquisitor</span> (April 1816), on the other hand, said his portrayal was good and censured the audience for taking a cowardly advantage and condemning him before he was heard. The performance was repeated with some success on 22 April 1816, but Cobham then disappeared from the West End.<br>
<br>In 1817 Cobham appeared at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, as Sir Giles Overreach, and played afterwards Macbeth and Richard. He was again in Dublin in 1821&#150;2 as a member of the Hawkins Street stock company, dividing with Warde the principal characters of tragedy. After Warde's disappearance he performed, in the memorable engagement of Kean in July 1822, Richmond, Iago, Edgar in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. Early in his career Cobham had played Glenalvon to the Young Norval of Kean at the Navy tavern, Woolwich. Later, at the Coburg Theatre, London, the two actors met once more, Kean playing Othello and Cobham Iago. The reception of Kean on this occasion by the transpontine audience, the faith of which in Cobham was never shaken, was unfavourable. (A full account of the scene of Kean's indignation and Cobham's speech to the audience appears in J. W. Cole's <span class="italic">Life of Charles Kean</span>, 1859, 1.161&#150;3.)<br>
<br>Cobham had some resemblance in appearance and stature to Kean, being dark, with flexible features, and about 5 feet 5 inches in height. In spite of Hazlitt's unfavourable verdict, he was a fair actor, a little given to rant, and to so-called and not very defensible new readings. In his later life he rarely quitted the south London stage. He died on 3 January 1842, leaving a son and a daughter, both of whom worked in the theatrical profession. The latter acted under the name of Mrs Fitzgerald.<br>
