<span class="headword">Lane,  Joseph</span>  (1851&#150;1920), <span class="occ">socialist campaigner</span>, was born on 2 April 1851 in the Oxfordshire village of Benson (or Bensington), the son of Thomas Lane, a cordwainer, and Mercy Lane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Warner, who was illiterate. Lane had virtually no education, and never managed to write grammatical English. He worked on the land from an early age, and soon took an interest in politics, supporting the campaign for land reform and taking part in the general election campaign of 1865. He moved to London, where he earned his living as a carter and spent his energy on politics. He married Isabella Adams on 5 September 1874, and had children, including several sons, but his family took no interest in his public life. He took part in the radical demonstrations of the mid-1860s, and joined the agrarian and republican movements. By the end of the 1870s he was taking a leading part in several radical organizations in central London&#151;the Manhood Suffrage League, the English section of the Social Democratic Club, the Marylebone Radical Association, and the Local Rights Association. He took part in the general election campaign of 1880, and then turned to more clearly revolutionary and socialist activity.<br>
<br>In 1881 Lane moved to east London, where he was involved in producing the English <span class="italic">Freiheit</span> in 1881 and <span class="italic">The Radical</span> from 1881 to 1882. In 1881 he formed the Homerton Social Democratic Club, whose meetings were suppressed by the police in 1882; he represented it as a delegate at the International Revolutionary Congress in London in 1881 and as a signatory of a manifesto calling for the revival of the International Working Men's Association in 1883. In 1882 he helped to found the socialist Labour Emancipation League and became its secretary. He organized public meetings and working men's clubs all over east London, and produced a series of propaganda leaflets. In 1884 he led its merger with the radical Democratic Federation to form the socialist Social Democratic Federation, and joined the executive, where he made friends with William Morris and enemies with H. M. Hyndman. At the end of 1884 he joined the revolutionary majority in seceding and forming the Socialist League, signing the latter's founding documents and joining its council. He became the manager and joint publisher of its paper <span class="italic">The Commonweal</span> in 1885, and was also an occasional contributor.<br>
<br>Lane was a leading member of the anti-parliamentarian fraction in the disputes which immediately divided and eventually destroyed the Socialist League. In 1886 he was appointed to a subcommittee attempting to draft an acceptable policy statement; in 1887, when the majority report recommended parliamentary socialism, he produced a minority report reaffirming revolutionary socialism. When both reports were rejected by the annual conference in May 1887, he published his in June 1887 as a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Anti-Statist, Communist Manifesto</span>, which became a standard text of extreme revolutionary and libertarian socialism short of anarchism.<br>
<br>The internal disputes continued in the Socialist League, and in 1889 Lane quietly resigned, partly for private reasons (he was offended by personal slights) and partly for political reasons (he preferred William Morris's circle to the extreme anarchists). He took no further direct part in socialist activity, though he kept in touch with his old comrades and continued to collect and distribute radical literature. He published occasional leaflets from 1906 to 1912, returning to the campaign for land reform, opposing tariff reform, supporting the syndicalist movement, and attacking reformist socialists. He moved to Forest Gate, and worked for a furrier in the City until his sudden death at East Ham, Essex, on 3 September 1920.<br>
<br>Lane was an earnest rather than eloquent speaker or writer, but he was an inspiring agitator and organizer. He was one of the central figures in the rise of revolutionary socialism in Britain during the 1880s, and author of its most convincing exposition produced by a native working-class writer. Unfortunately he left only manuscript notes for an autobiography. William Morris wrote to him when he left the Socialist League: &#145;I always looked upon you as one of the <i>serious</i> members of the League&#146;  (Morris to Lane, 21 May 1889, <span class="italic">The Collected Letters of William Morris</span>, ed. N. Kelvin, 3, 1996, 68). And the anarchist historian Max Nettlau, who knew him in the Socialist League, wrote a decade after his death: &#145;I consider him to be the best head English socialism possessed in the years 1879 to 1889&#146;  (Nettlau, 3.349).<br>
