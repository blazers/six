<span class="headword">Church,  Arthur Harry</span>  (1865&#150;1937), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 28 March 1865 at 32 Oxford Place, Plymouth, the eldest son of Henry Church(<i>b</i>. 1830/31), a saddler, and his wife, Mary Head, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (<i>c</i>.1824&#150;1887). He was educated at Ashburton grammar school where, at sixteen, he became a pupil teacher. On the death of his mother, he received &pound;100, enabling him to go to University College, Aberystwyth, in 1887. There he met Emma Palmer Pratt (1868&#150;1916), eldest child of Henry Pratt, a Warwick chemist and relation of the Victorian botanist Anne Pratt (1806&#150;1893); they married in 1898 and had three daughters. In 1889 Church obtained an external London BSc degree and won one of the two scholarships offered to mature students by Queen's and Jesus colleges, Oxford, entering Jesus in 1891. He graduated with first-class honours in botany in 1894 and was appointed demonstrator in the department of botany. In 1897 Church did much to restore the neglected Oxford Botanical Museum (later dispersed) then at the botanic garden. In 1904 he took the London degree of DSc and acted as lecturer in natural sciences at Jesus, where he was a research fellow from 1908 to 1912. He was lecturer from 1910 until 1930, when he retired early; in 1921 he was elected FRS.<br>
<br>Church's most influential work, <span class="italic">Thalassiophyta</span>, with its celebrated opening words, &#145;The beginnings of botany are in the sea&#146;, appeared in 1919. <span class="italic">Thalassiophyta</span> was part of the flood of material Church published that year on his return to work after the deaths, in 1916, of his elder surviving daughter, Rosemary (from tuberculosis), and his beloved wife (from gastroenteritis). Their deaths led him to believe that his work had caused him to neglect them. The events of the First World War and the deaths of so many of his friends and pupils had compounded his despair, leading to a depression at times verging on insanity. By 1927 he had a wider knowledge of the facts of botany than any English botanist of his generation. He had, in addition, most of the characteristics of genius&#151;creative power, vigour, independence, and originality. The whole pageant of plant evolution was considered in his revolutionary botany. He was not one to be hampered by clinging detail, yet he was painstaking in his analysis of floral structure, phyllotaxis, and algal life cycles. His highly original, and no less controversial, ideas were mainly published in <span class="italic">Oxford Botanical Memoirs</span> (1919&#150;25). Church held that the invasion of the land was by plants with massive structure and elaborate life history, not by the then fashionable little green filaments. How he came upon his new synthesis is unclear but his thesis was taken up most wholeheartedly by his disciple, the Cambridge botanist E. J. H. (John) Corner (1906&#150;1996), in his Durian theory of the origin of the flowering plant tree (1949) and especially in his influential textbook, <span class="italic">The Life of Plants</span> (1964).<br>
<br>Church's prose style is difficult, the sentences long and involved, but nothing can be skipped in his tight argument. His early work on phyllotaxis was rejected by the Linnean Society and his findings, still quoted today, were published independently. He edited <span class="italic">Oxford Botanical Memoirs</span> himself and their conciseness may reflect his personal financial liability. He fell out with the Clarendon Press over the production of his sumptuous <span class="italic">Types of Floral Mechanism</span>, so that only one volume of the work appeared, in 1908, though he continued work on it until 1915. It was illustrated with his own drawings, many of them in colour; they are some of the finest produced in modern times. Most were subsequently preserved in the British Museum (Natural History), and their strikingly bold, almost <i>Jugendstil</i>, images were used on greetings cards in the 1980s. On field classes he would take his heavy plate camera with him; he was an outstanding photographer.<br>
<br>Church taught all aspects of botany save the directly physiological. His lectures were masterful, intellectually stimulating, and entertaining, almost theatrical, at their best, though in later years they became more garrulous and digressive. He was &#145;an unassuming, lively, genial, humorous little man of astonishing learning, almost a recluse, but with a mind that roamed the world&#146;  (Corner, 1). His humour was often cynical, irreverent, and anticlerical; his shy and retiring ways did not endear him to his senior colleagues, and university politics did not interest him, these &#145;flaws&#146; leading to Sir Arthur Tansley's referring to him as a genius manqu&eacute;.<br>
<br>Church died at his home, 246 Iffley Road, Oxford, on 24 April 1937 and his papers were dispersed. Most, many of which had been given to, or intended for, Corner, were brought back to Oxford in 1977, some having survived the looting by allied troops of Corner's house in wartime Singapore. A laboratory in the department of plant sciences at Oxford was named after him in 1993.<br>
