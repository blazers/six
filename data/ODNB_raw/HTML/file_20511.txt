<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Calvach, Don</span> <span class="st"> [Calvach O'Connor]</span>  (1584&#150;1655), <span class="occ">clan leader</span>, was the eldest son of Hugh O'Connor Don (<i>d</i>. 1632) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Brian O'Rourke, lord of Breifne (co. Leitrim). The term don (<i>recte</i> donn, or brown) was used to distinguish this branch of the sept from the collateral O'Connor Roe (<i>recte</i> rua, or red) branch. In 1610 Hugh O'Connor Don executed a deed dividing his extensive territory, known as the Maghery (<i>Irish, machaire</i>, plain) in North Roscommon between his sons Calvach and Hugh Oge. The division did not, however, receive royal sanction and was therefore delayed. Some time before 1616 Calvach married Mary, daughter of Sir Theobald Burke, or Tibbot na Long (<i>Irish, long</i>, ship). O'Connor was apparently elected member of parliament for co. Roscommon for the 1613 parliament but the presiding officer called a second vote after most of O'Connor's voters had left the premises. With O'Connor's supporters allegedly prevented from returning by soldiers posted at the door, a candidate representing the New English interest was then elected. A government commission subsequently found that no impropriety had taken place. The finding was unsurprising in view of the government's determined, and successful, efforts to secure overall New English control of the Irish parliament. On Hugh O'Connor Don's death in 1632 his lands were finally divided between Calvach and his younger brother Hugh Oge. Calvach acquired the castle and demesne of Ballintober, co. Roscommon.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the 1641 rising, Calvach O'Connor was present, on Christmas eve, at an attack on the abbey of Roscommon as the &#145;reputed general of Roscommon&#146;  (deposition of John Ridge, TCD, MS 830, fol. 4) under the overall command of Con O'Rourke of Leitrim. O'Connor received some popular acclamation as &#145;King of Connacht&#146;  (deposition of Elizabeth Holliwell, TCD, MS 830, fol. 35)&#151;a faint echo of the former prominence of the O'Connor Don lineage. Others, however, assumed a more prominent role. Con O'Rourke led the insurgent attack on Castle Coote, a strong government outpost south of Ballintober on the Galway border. In the course of this operation <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20516/', "Hugh O'Connor Don")</script>, eldest son of Calvach, was taken prisoner in March/April 1642 when Charles Coote surprised the besiegers' camp at Creggs. Calvach O'Connor was one of those subscribing in January 1642 to an appeal to the earl of Clanricarde to assume leadership of the Connaught forces. However, his brother Hugh and Lucas Dillon took the leading role in these negotiations.<br>
<br>According to Edmund Borlase, O'Connor remained inactive in the months following his son's capture &#145;though the tacit votes of that province did seem to own him as their king&#146;  (Borlase, 81). However, in July 1642 &#145;he began to awake&#146;  (ibid.) and mobilized an army of about 2000 men at Ballintober. On the approach of government forces from Athlone a body of Irish pikemen attacked without waiting for support from their musketeers. The pikemen were driven back by superior firepower and the disordered formation routed by a cavalry charge and pursued back to Ballintober.<br>
<br>O'Connor did not play a prominent part in the military or political affairs of the confederate Catholic regime established in 1642. He was elected a member of the general assembly of the confederates on three occasions during the 1640s. He was one of the individuals exempted by name from pardon by the Cromwellians in 1652. He died in 1655, leaving two sons, Hugh and Charles. His widow, as a person (notionally) transplanted to Connaught, secured 700 acres out of a total estate of about 6000 acres.<br>
