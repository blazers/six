<span class="headword">Stoughton,  Israel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1603, <em>d.</em> 1644), <span class="occ">colonist in America</span>, baptized at Great Coggeshall, Essex, on 18 February 1603, was the third son of Thomas Stoughton (<i>c</i>.1557&#150;<i>c</i>.1622), clergyman, and his wife, Katherine (<i>c</i>.1560&#150;<i>c</i>.1603). His father was deprived of his living for nonconformity in 1606 and moved to Great Totham, Essex. Israel Stoughton's marriage on 27 March 1627 at Rotherhithe, Surrey, to Elizabeth Knight (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;1681) linked him with later emigrants to New England, Thomas Clarke and David Yale, while his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66152/', "John Stoughton's")</script> marriage and first cure of Aller, Somerset, connected him with west country emigrants. Following his eldest brother, Thomas, he emigrated to Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1632. He was admitted freeman in 1633 and became the leader of protests against arbitrary and secretive magisterial authority, demanding constitutional curbs on the discretionary powers of the governor and assistants. In 1634 he was chosen an auditor of Governor Winthrop's accounts, while at the general court &#145;some of the assistants were questioned by the freemen for some errors in their government.&#146; A resolution was taken in May 1634 to include elected representatives in the Massachusetts general court and Stoughton was one of the first deputies. In turn, Governor Winthrop was replaced in office, for the first time, by Thomas Dudley. Stoughton also opposed a magisterial veto in court proceedings. In a 1635 reaction in favour of order, Stoughton, attacked by Winthrop as &#145;a troubler in Israel, a worm, an underminer of the state&#146;, was induced to propose the burning of his &#145;Twelve Objections to the Negative Voice &hellip; for peace's sake&#146;  (&#145;Letter of Israel Stoughton&#146;, 446&#150;58). He was declared incapable of holding office for three years, but this was remitted in 1636. The following year he was elected an assistant, and was re-elected until 1643. In alliance with Richard Bellingham and Richard Saltonstall he continued to resist magisterial pretensions. He represented Massachusetts in boundary negotiations with Plymouth in 1639. As captain of the Dorchester militia in the 1637 Pequot War, he was responsible for mopping up, executing, or enslaving defeated American Indians; he was promoted colony sergeant-major-general in 1641. He returned to England in 1643, became lieutenant-colonel of Colonel Thomas Rainsborough's regiment in the parliamentarian forces, but died the next year at Lincoln. He was survived by six children, including his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26607/', "William Stoughton (1631&#150;1701)")</script>, who as lieutenant-governor presided over the Salem witchcraft trials in 1692. Israel Stoughton was a key figure in the first-generation conflict between &#145;the divine right of magistrates&#146; and representative government, as a commercial company charter was adapted into a political constitution.<br>
