<span class="headword">Godolphin, Sir  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1518, <em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Sir William Godolphin (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1547), landowner, of Godolphin, Cornwall, and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of John Glynn of Morval, Cornwall. The family may reliably be connected with the parish of Breage in Cornwall from the late thirteenth century. The existing house at Godolphin was begun by John Godolghan about 1475. His son and namesake, the elder Sir William Godolphin's father, served as sheriff of Cornwall in 1504 and 1508, and the next reign saw the family consolidate its social and economic dominance over the county's remote western hundreds. Its wealth was industrial rather than agricultural, based chiefly on the extraction and smelting of tin: John Leland observed that there were &#145;no greater tynne workes yn al Cornwal then be on Sir Wylliam Godolcan's ground&#146;  (<span class="italic">Itinerary</span>, 1.191). Sir William Godolphin senior was pricked sheriff in 1533 and ingratiated himself with Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary, throughout the 1530s, forwarding information on the state of the peace and sending him Cornish wrestlers and tin miners. The principal secretary responded by taking the younger William Godolphin and two brothers into his own household. Possibly Godolphin had some legal training, since a William Godolphin was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in November 1537. In 1539, the year in which his father was appointed to the council of the west, he was nominated by Cromwell as knight of the shire for Cornwall.<br>
<br>In 1544 Godolphin was in northern France, serving as master of the mines at the sieges of Montreuil and Boulogne. Cornish tinners were highly prized as sappers, and he commanded the company that successfully undermined the walls of Boulogne. In August he was wounded in action, &#145;no less to the beautifying of his fame than the disfiguring of his face&#146;, as noted by Richard Carew of Antony, Cornwall  (Carew, 133&#150;4). He was rewarded with the bailiwick of the town, and sat on its council until Boulogne was returned to the French in 1550. He was also knighted, apparently in 1546, at which point it becomes even more difficult to separate father and son in the records. The problem is compounded by the lack of firm evidence for the year of his father's death; 1547 seems the best estimate.<br>
<br>In April 1548 Godolphin led his fellow magistrates in pacifying west Cornwall following the murder of the avaricious archdeacon, William Body, during a riot in defence of the traditional liturgy in Helston. He had little sympathy for the protesters, and in July he organized a band of mounted gentlemen and parish constables against any resurgence of sedition. He also assisted in surveying the revenues of the dissolved chantries in Cornwall and Devon. When a far more serious religious insurrection erupted in 1549 an informer sent him secret information on one of the rebel leaders, Humphrey Arundell. On 22 July Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector, and the privy council wrote to John Russell, first Baron Russell, lord privy seal, about a proclamation confiscating rebel property: &#145;a better personage to execute it can not be devised then Sir William Godolphin, who hath bene a frontier man&#146;  (Pocock, 33). Godolphin was chosen sheriff of Cornwall later in the year. In December 1549 he was bound over to keep the peace with Sir John Arundell of Lanherne. In 1551 he served as vice-admiral of Cornwall, and in March 1553 he was again elected knight of the shire.<br>
<br>Godolphin had cleaved to the protestant military establishment under Edward VI, and the accession of Mary I left him in an uncomfortable position. A William Godolphin was reported as present in the entourage of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, in Venice in the summer of 1555. The exile is unlikely to be the head of the family, since Sir William Godolphin was still listed as a JP in 1555, when he was included among the magistrates detailed to intervene in a dispute in Launceston. But his reformed religion may help to explain a challenge to the controllership of tin coinage in Cornwall that Godolphin had enjoyed since 1545. In 1555 the crown apparently granted William Isham the same lucrative office, resulting in an unseemly riot between the servants of the two parties in Truro coinage hall. Godolphin recovered his local position under Elizabeth I, serving as sheriff of Cornwall in 1568 and as deputy lieutenant in 1569.<br>
<br>The interest of the Godolphins in the Isles of Scilly dates from the mid-sixteenth century. Lying 28 miles off Land's End, this sparsely populated territory was vulnerable to French attack. Thomas Godolphin became the military captain of Scilly during Edward's reign, directing the fortification and provisioning of the islands. In August 1556 the privy council thanked Sir William Godolphin for apprehending the pirate Jacob Thomson at Scilly, though it subsequently rebuked him for acquitting several of Thomson's compatriots. In summer 1558 Godolphin petitioned the crown to farm the islands for &pound;20, Bedford acting as mediator. One of the first tasks carried out by the Elizabethan privy council was to draw up Godolphin's lease of the islands. Thus began an association between the Godolphins and Scilly that would endure until the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Godolphin married Blanche, daughter of Robert Langdon of the parish of St Martin, Cornwall; they had two daughters. He died in 1570 and was buried at Breage on 30 July. The house and estate then passed to his nephew <a name="cosubject_37464"></a><span class="headword">Sir Francis Godolphin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1534&#150;1608), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, who was the elder son of Sir William's younger brother Thomas Godolphin and his first wife, Katherine, daughter and heir of Edmund Bonython. He followed his uncle's lead, serving as JP for Cornwall from the mid-1570s and sitting as knight for Cornwall in 1589 and MP for Lostwithiel in 1593. In 1580 he was knighted. He was pricked sheriff in 1579 and 1604, was deputy lieutenant from 1585, and became receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall in 1586. Further details on him are supplied in the 1602 <span class="italic">Survey of Cornwall</span> written by his friend Richard Carew. Godolphin's pre-eminence on the commission of the peace reflected his &#145;zeal in religion, uprightness in justice, providence in government, and plentiful housekeeping&#146;  (Carew, 228). He was of the quorum by 1583. 300 men worked his tin, silver, and copper mines. Carew also shines a little light upon the library at Godolphin. Having borrowed from Sir Francis Godolphin a scientific treatise on the mind, Carew translated it from Italian into English and dedicated it to him: &#145;Good Sir, your Booke returneth unto you clad in a Cornish gabardine&#146;  (ibid., 34).<br>
<br>Invasion was a perennial fear in later Elizabethan Cornwall, and Godolphin was variously responsible for musters, the fortification of ports, and the early-warning system of beacon fires. In July 1595 he directed the defence of Penzance against a Spanish raiding party that had burned Paul church and the village of Mousehole. His greatest achievement, however, lay even further west. The lease of Scilly had been regranted in 1570, and in 1593 he was commanded to build a fort on St Mary's. His collaborator in the initial stages of construction was the architect and engineer Robert Adams, who may also be responsible for the fine symmetrical stables at Godolphin. The queen granted a miserly &pound;400 for the works, leaving Godolphin to advance &pound;600 of his own money and to use his soldiers for labour. The result was Star Castle, an eight-pointed fortification commanding the peninsula above Hugh Town and the sheltered harbour between the islands. Provision was made for a permanent garrison, with additional gun platforms, blockhouses, windmills, and a beacon pit to alert the mainland in case of attack. Finance, however, was a continuing problem. In 1600 Godolphin petitioned the privy council to replace the badly rusted and outdated ordnance brought to the islands some fifty years before. He also argued the case for outer earthworks, essential to protect the fort from enemy artillery, but in vain: they were never built. Carew praised Godolphin's castle as &#145;a sure hold and a commodious dwelling&#146;  (Carew, 156), but Sir Francis had a more sophisticated comprehension of military architecture and was all too aware of the weakness of his design in the absence of additional fortification. His letters to Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary, speak of his deep anxiety about the depleted state of the Scilly garrison and the threat of Spanish assault and occupation. Star Castle still stands, a tribute to Godolphin's energy and administrative acumen in the remotest of locations.<br>
<br>In 1552 Francis Godolphin married Margaret, daughter of John Killigrew of Arwenack, Falmouth. They had three sons and six daughters; the eldest son, another William Godolphin (<i>d</i>. 1613), served with courage in Robert Devereux, earl of Essex's army in Ireland. Sir Francis's second wife was Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Skerret, widow of John Glanville. They had no children and she outlived him. He died in 1608 and was buried at Breage on 23 April. His will of 1606 testifies to a strong belief in godly charity. He bequeathed the large sum of &pound;200 to be distributed in Penwith and Kerrier hundreds &#145;towardes the relief and settinge their poore to worke and for restrayninge them from ydle loyteringe and wandringe abroade&#146;. He reserved &pound;40 for a local &#145;howse of correction&#146;, should one be established within ten years of his death, and left 20 marks to build lodgings on Godolphin Hill for four &#145;poore decayed tynners&#146; in his service  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/111, sig. 46). He also bequeathed money to support weekly preaching in Helston church. The Godolphin estate was inherited by his eldest son, who replaced him as receiver of the duchy of Cornwall.<br>
