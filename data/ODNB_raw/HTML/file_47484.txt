<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  William</span>  (1744&#150;1808), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was the youngest son of the iron-founder <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47483/', "Isaac Wilkinson (bap. 1695, d. 1784)")</script> and his wife, Mary Johnson (<i>d</i>. 1786), and brother of the more famous <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29428/', "John Wilkinson")</script>. At the time of his birth his parents were living at Backbarrow in Lancashire. He entered Joseph Priestley's school at Nantwich, Cheshire, probably in 1759, and followed Priestley to Warrington Academy in 1761. In 1762 Priestley married Mary, sister of John and William. William's training was probably at the family ironworks at Bersham, Denbighshire, where in 1774 his brother John admitted him to a partnership on very favourable terms. The works had already a great reputation for the casting of steam engine cylinders, guns, pipes, and many other products. William briefly became managing partner at Bersham, though the advanced technology applied there was developed by John.<br>
<br>In 1775 the French brigadier Marchant de la Houli&egrave;re, who was trying to develop iron smelting with coal in France, visited John Wilkinson at his New Willey (Broseley, Shropshire) works. He was particularly interested in John's achievement in the boring of cast-iron guns from solid, and wished to bring him to France. John could not go, but proposed the services of William, who agreed enthusiastically.<br>
<br>William Wilkinson made a preliminary visit to France within weeks. It was probably at this early stage that the Isle of Indret on the Loire near Nantes was identified as a site for water-powered mills to bore cannon. Early in 1777 he returned to France, Indret works was built, and Wilkinson was granted 12,000 livres salary, soon rising to 50,000. He supplied all the plans for Indret, but quickly had difficulties with French associates who complained of &#145;le despotisme anglais&#146;. However he established better relations with the engineer Pierre Toufaire, who executed the works Wilkinson planned in France. The 2 million livres Indret had cost produced but few cannon, and this failure was investigated. The great artillery expert Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval recommended Ignace de Wendel, an artilleryman, and from a great family of ironmasters, to examine the situation. He took over Indret and decided that the problem was caused by the lack of coke iron for solid-bored cannon, not obtainable when England and France were at war. The answer was to be the creation of a great coke ironworks in France, and Wilkinson was considered to be the only man available to accomplish it.<br>
<br>The site chosen was Le Creusot near Montcenis in Burgundy. Wilkinson's payment was to be 216,000 livres, plus living and travelling expenses. His contract showed that he would need to consult his brother John and to refresh his knowledge of the rapidly changing technology in England. Le Creusot as finished had four coke-iron blast furnaces with steam-powered blast, reverberatory furnaces, large coking facilities, and 5 leagues of iron railway. Curiously Wilkinson was only on site for nine months during its building over 1781&#150;4. The Wilkinsons supplied three steam engines at high prices. The investment was enormous and the crown a major shareholder. The furnaces came into blast in 1785 but the iron made was poor, and within a few years the cannon-boring mills there were occupied with charcoal iron and bronze cannon. For several decades Le Creusot was a &#145;contre-exemple&#146;  (Woronoff, 335), dissuading the further take-up of British coke-iron technology in France.<br>
<br>After a return to Britain in 1786 Wilkinson made some further extensive European journeys, finally settling again at Plas Grono near Wrexham in 1789. He soon quarrelled with his brother John over the management of Bersham, and particularly his accrued profit from his share in this highly successful works during his absence abroad. Lawsuits began in 1794, and he was at law with John Wilkinson and other family members until his death. Wilkinson objected to John's continued development and diversification of his own industrial interests outside Bersham, and wanted the maximum return from Bersham and associated enterprises. During the dispute Wilkinson became an ally of Boulton and Watt, with whom John had long worked as a supplier of cylinders for their engines. Their interests changed, they were no longer allies of John Wilkinson and his friend Thomas Williams in the copper trade, they had just discharged a large debt to John, and were now ready to sue him over his illegal &#145;pirate&#146; sales of their patent engines. They hoped William Wilkinson would be of use to them in creating their own engine-making works at Soho, Birmingham, begun in 1795. He made available to them John's newly invented cupola furnace. John arranged to sell Bersham, moving much equipment to his new works at Brymbo. William set about seducing Bersham workers for Boulton and Watt. The case went to arbitration, and the works were put up for sale, being taken over by Thomas Jones, nephew to William and John, with capital supplied by John. Subsequently there were bitter lawsuits of great complication between the brothers over their north Wales lead-mining interests, William Wilkinson being a partner with John in the Minera mine. There were smelters at Bersham and Brymbo, the latter owned solely by John. Eventually John sold his share of the mine, ceding it to his partners. Wilkinson and his associates were not very successful in its subsequent management and it was again under John's control at the time of William's death.<br>
<br>Wilkinson married late in life, in 1791. His wife was Elizabeth Kirkes (<i>d</i>. 1808) of Liverpool, a widow, and daughter of James Stockdale of Cark Hall, Cartmel, a district with which the Wilkinsons had long associations. The Stockdales had extensive business interests, including a cotton mill. A daughter, Mary Anne, was born in 1795, and a second daughter, Elizabeth Stockdale, in 1799, the elder marrying Matthew Robinson Boulton, only son of the great Birmingham industrialist, in 1813.<br>
<br>William Wilkinson is significant for his part in the attempted transfer of a large part of British coal-iron technology to France. While eventually the cannon-boring technology devised by his brother was successfully transferred, the great iron smelter at Le Creusot was largely a failure, and Wilkinson's supercilious and overbearing manner and his failure to give enough personal supervision must take some blame. Like his father he seems to have pursued litigation too readily, and he at least matched his brother in his arbitrary disposition, while having none of his inventive or innovative ability, or the capacity to manage a large and diverse business empire. He died at Plas Grono in March 1808, having appointed the younger James Watt to be guardian to his daughters.<br>
