<span class="headword">Price,  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1574), <span class="occ">founder of Jesus College, Oxford</span>, was the son of a Brecon butcher, Rhys ap Rhys. He may have been educated in Brecon, or perhaps at Osney Abbey, and later attended Oxford University; he graduated BCL (probably in 1518), BCnL in 1524, and DCnL in 1526. He was one of a group of judges who tried and condemned James Bainham for heresy in 1532. There is no record of his ordination, but at intervals he held a number of livings: Cranbrook, in Kent (1533&#150;54); St Leonard, Foster Lane, London (1542&#150;8); and Llan-faes, Brecknockshire (1554&#150;74). In 1541 he was appointed treasurer of St David's Cathedral, with dispensation from residing there. When the see of Rochester was re-established in the same year, he was appointed as first prebendary there. He held both preferments until his death. He purchased and retained a house in Brecon, and has been identified as the Hugh Price who was bailiff of the borough in 1572. He died, almost certainly in Brecon, in August 1574, and was buried in St John the Evangelist Priory church; he never married.<br>
<br>Jesus College, Oxford, was founded on Price's initiative in 1571 &#145;for the spread and maintenance of the Christian religion in its sincere form&#146;  (Williams, 62). He provided an endowment and petitioned Queen Elizabeth, who established the college, claimed for herself the title of founder, and transferred to it the site, buildings, and property of the former White Hall. Price promised his foundation &pound;60 a year. Only part of the main quadrangle was built before he died. He bequeathed 100 marks and his books, and confirmed the &pound;60 a year to the college on condition &#145;that I remaine Founder of the same College&#146;  (Jones, 146), but there were long delays before the money was made available. In the eighteenth century Edward Yardley remembered Price, as he would have wished, as &#145;the worthy promoter or rather the founder of Jesus College&#146;. However, the college did not pay its founder the compliment of adopting his arms. Its familiar arms, originally with a blue field, which can be linked with the arms of the family of Green, were in use by 1590.<br>
