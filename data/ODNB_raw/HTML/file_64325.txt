<span class="headword">Careless,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Betty]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1752), <span class="occ">actress and prostitute</span>, was known as Mrs or Miss Betty Careless. It is probable that she was acting before her name first appeared in the extant bills for the role of Polly in John Gray's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at the Haymarket Theatre on 30 December 1728. During the years 1730&#150;32 she was an active member of a range of lesser known companies, performing such parts as Cherry in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> at the Haymarket on 18 September 1730. She acted at the Lee-Harper booth at Southwark fair on 24 September 1730, at Goodman's Fields on 26 March 1731, and at the Haymarket on 1 April 1732. It is likely that she undertook various engagements during the 1730s, such as acting the roles of Mariana in Fielding's <span class="italic">The Miser</span>, a Lady of Pleasure in <span class="italic">The Ridotto al' fresco</span>, and Miss Witless in <span class="italic">The Comical Humours of Sir John Falstaff</span> (the latter two both theatrical compilations, or &#145;catchpenny entertainments&#146;) in a booth operated by Hallam, Griffin, Bullock, and Cibber in August and September 1733 at Bartholomew fair.<br>
<br>The next notice of Betty Careless does not appear until 27 October 1741, when she was known to have danced a minuet and performed the part of Polly for her own benefit at the small theatre in James Street. Tickets could be procured from Mrs Careless's Coffee House, which was probably located in Covent Garden, where she advertised: &#145;Mrs Careless hopes her friends will favour her according to their promise, to relieve her from terrible fits of the vapours, proceeding from bad dreams, tho' the comfort is they generally go by contraries&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>). Following this she acted the role of Cherry at James Street on 31 March 1743 and an unspecified part in Thomas Baker's <span class="italic">Tunbridge Walks</span> for her own benefit on 15 April 1743.<br>
<br>The last theatrical notices known for Betty Careless were at Hallam's booth at May fair in 1744, when she was billed as the celebrated Mrs Careless. She acted various parts in a range of plays, which included Colombine in the theatrical compilation <span class="italic">Harlequin Sclavonian</span> on 1 May, Cherry in <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> on 7 June, and Rose in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> on 8 June.<br>
<br>Betty Careless had a &#145;celebrated&#146; reputation as a strumpet in the area of Covent Garden Theatre. She is depicted in a print (set in the Covent Garden piazza) by the French engraver Louis Pierre Boitard (1747):<blockquote>which showed her asleep in a [sedan] chair, attended by the rakes Captain Marcellus Laroon and Captain Montague and their link-boy, Little Cazey&#151;persons regarded by Fielding, when Bow Street magistrate, as &#145;the three most troublesome and difficult to manage of all my Bow Street visitors&#146;. (<span class="italic">BDA</span>)</blockquote>Her name was also used by Hogarth in one of the plates of <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> recorded her funeral on 22 April 1752:<blockquote>The famed Betty Careless was buried from the poor's house of St. Paul's Covent-garden. She had helped the gay gentlemen of this nation to squander above 50,000 &pound; though at last reduced to live on alms;&#151;almost the certain consequence attending women of her unhappy cast of life. (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 213)</blockquote>The burial was registered as being on 22 April 1752, where she is defined as a widow. It would appear that she spent the last years of her life in the poorhouse of St Paul's Church in Covent Garden.<br>
