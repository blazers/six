<span class="headword">Lloyd,  George</span>  (1560/61&#150;1615), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester</span>, was the sixth son of Meredith Lloyd of Llaneilian-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire, and Janet, daughter of Hugh Conway, both from old gentry families. He may have settled in Chester as early as 1566: in October 1613 he said he had &#145;known&#146; the city &#145;these forty-seven years&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 2103, fol. 8<i>v</i>). Certainly he attended the King's School, Chester, from 1575 to 1579, before entering Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1582. He became a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1585 and proceeded BD in 1593 and DD in 1598. In 1594 Lloyd was elected to the divinity lectureship in Chester Cathedral, during the mayoralty of his eldest brother David Lloyd, a wealthy merchant. Three years later he became rector of Heswall, Cheshire, and he held the parish for the next seventeen years; during that time he and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of John Wilkinson, probably of Northwich, Cheshire (given as Norwich in BL, Lansdowne MS 879), had at least seven children, the eldest of whom, John, was baptized at Heswall in October 1599. On 23 December 1599 Lloyd was presented to the bishopric of Sodor and Man, by the queen rather than the earl of Derby, there being no dean or chapter in the diocese of Man by which any election might be made. His consecration may have been at Chester, not York. Little is known of his activities on Man but the extent and promptness of the reforms introduced five years later by his successor, John Phillips, suggest that there was pressing need for them after Lloyd was translated to Chester, in succession to Richard Vaughan.<br>
<br>Lloyd was presented to the bishopric of Chester on 18 December 1604 and the royal assent followed on 9 January 1605. He was attentive to his administrative duties in his new see but his mildness of manner encouraged laxity among his officials. Visitations were held regularly, but with limited results. He deprived two ministers in 1606, and occasionally rejected others unwilling to conform to the terms of the 1604 canons, but puritan clergy in general were dealt with leniently. In the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot he treated Roman Catholics with moderation and even diffidence, at times seeking guidance from the privy council. Relations between the city and the cathedral grew fractious during Lloyd's episcopate, however, and in two sermons preached in the cathedral in 1614 he seemed to reflect adversely on the outgoing mayor, Robert Whitby, the puritanical clerk of the pentice and client of Lord Keeper Ellesmere, and his son Edward Whitby, the new recorder. Lloyd's family associations with the late recorder, Thomas Gamull, prompted the accusation that he had been &#145;an earnest labourer&#146; for a rival candidate  (Harleian MS 2103, fol. 11<i>r</i>). Lloyd, a skilful preacher, held firmly Calvinist convictions nevertheless; Sir John Harington noted how Prince Henry &#145;heard him Preach often, and very well&#146;, although none of his sermons was published  (Harington). Twice, in 1605 and 1609, Lloyd was invited to deliver a Lenten sermon at court, but on each occasion Martin Heton, bishop of Ely, deputized.<br>
<br>At the time of his appointment to Sodor and Man, Lloyd claimed his finances would not bear a journey to York; however, as bishop of Chester he had the benefit of Marian improvements to the see and held, in addition first to Heswall and then to Bangor (the living favoured by bishops of Chester) which he exchanged for Heswall in 1613, the substantial livings of Thornton, Waverton, Childwall, and Cartmel in Lancashire, while in 1608 his wife and sons leased Shotwick, Cheshire, from the dean and chapter of Chester. Like Vaughan, Lloyd struggled with the deaneries, in 1615 giving up his attempt to control those in the archdeaconry of Richmond, and granting leases of seven rural deaneries to the commissaries there. Financially there remained much for his successor, John Bridgeman, to do. Lloyd died in his rectory at Thornton on 1 August 1615 in his fifty-fifth year, and was buried &#145;swiftly&#146;  (Burne, 95) five days later in Chester Cathedral. A brass plate set up in his memory has since disappeared, but the text of its inscription has survived.<br>
