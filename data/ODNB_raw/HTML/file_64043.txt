<span class="headword">Pollard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gladstone]</span>,  Margaret Steuart</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Cornish poet</span>, was born at 2 Whitehall Court, London, on 1 March 1904, daughter of John Steuart Gladstone (1862&#150;1920), an East India merchant, and his wife, Anne Fitzgibbon, and granddaughter of W. E. Gladstone's niece Mary Ellen (who married her second cousin Robert Gladstone). After a basic education at Eversley School, Folkestone, she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1922. She became a college scholar, and obtained in 1924 and 1925 first-class honours in both parts of the oriental languages tripos, the first woman to do so. She was Caroline Turle scholar in 1925&#150;6 and received the degree of PhD in 1952. Her initial interest was Hinduism, but she learned (and taught) Russian, and became interested in the Eastern Orthodox church, later translating Old Church Slavonic Marian hymns.<br>
<br>Peggy Gladstone moved to Cornwall after her marriage on 30 June 1928 to George Francis Giffard Pollard (1905/6&#150;1968) (RNVR, known as Frank or Cap'n), a journalist and the son of John Empson Toplis Pollard, a solicitor, whom she met at Cambridge. She became interested in preserving Cornwall and its landscape from what she (and others) saw as the encroaching vandalism of the modern world, and served as Cornish secretary for the Council for the Preservation of Rural England from 1935 to 1945. She was a practical champion of the countryside through membership between 1932 and 1937 of Ferguson's Gang, the unorthodox group of anonymous fund-raisers for the National Trust, mainly women (Ferguson may or may not have existed), and Pollard used the name Bill Stickers (as in &#145;bill stickers will be prosecuted&#146;). Her donations to causes of this nature and to other charitable works cannot be calculated.<br>
<br>In accordance with her attitude towards preservation, Peggy Pollard became interested in the movement to revive the Cornish language, which had based itself upon the language of the medieval Cornish plays. Peggy Pollard learned revival Cornish and was enthusiastically involved with the Cornish bardic gathering, the Gorseth. She became a bard in 1938 with the name Arlodhes Ywerdhon, Irish Lady, after a rock at the north end of Gamper Bay, near Land's End and part of the estate of Mayon Cliff, which the National Trust purchased in 1935. The rock's eponym, who perished there, was said to appear with a lantern on stormy nights: it was a good name to choose.<br>
<br>Peggy Pollard wrote English songs and poems about the county, and in 1947 <span class="italic">Cornwall</span>, a book giving a brief but pithy impression of Cornish life; but she contributed to the continued revival of the Cornish language principally with her &#145;mystery plays&#146;. One gained the Gorseth prize in 1941, and another satirized members of the movement, but they are lost; Pollard also won the prize in 1940 with <span class="italic">Bewnans Alysaryn</span> (&#145;The life of Alysaryn&#146;) and this was published, in 1941. Now viewed as a forgotten milestone of modern Cornish, it is at once pastiche, parody, and serious play. Early Cornish drama includes a saint's life played over two days, which mixes comic and serious elements. Pollard's play is divided into eleven (pretty short) &#145;days&#146;, and parodies the medieval texts by having the stage directions in spoof early English; one character &#145;goeth completelie dottie&#146;, while some torturers (stock characters in Cornish mystery plays) are accompanied by &#145;the Press&#146;. At the end of the second &#145;day&#146; she suggests that &#145;if expense bee no object, let them set fire to the house for a spectacular curtaine&#146;. Her Cornish imitates elements (and imprecations) from the older plays, with occasional English or Latin; yet the play is also serious, with Alysaryn a reluctant and (in spite of a close encounter with Beelzebub) theologically rather modern saint, miracle worker, and martyr, between God and the devil, wanting only to be his own honest self. For all that, the play ends with hymns.<br>
<br>Pollard was much involved with Truro Cathedral and spent time as secretary to the evangelical bishop Joseph Hunkin, but converted to Catholicism in the 1950s and helped to revive in 1965 the fifteenth-century guild of Our Lady of the Portal, supporting the building of a Catholic church in Truro. Our Lady of the Portal and St Piran (the Cornish national saint) was opened in 1973 on the presumed site of a medieval chapel. In the guild she was simply Sister X, and members said their devotions on the telephone at specific times every evening. At eighty she led a group to the baroque pilgrimage church of Vierzehnheiligen in Bavaria. She exhibited watercolours and embroidered for the cathedral. Her embroidery of C. S. Lewis's <span class="italic">Narnia</span> stories is almost as long as the Bayeux tapestry. She was (briefly) a teacher in Probus.<br>
<br>Peggy Pollard is not easy to sum up: she was a linguist with strong mystical-theological interests which manifested themselves differently at different points in her life. She was literary, witty, and practical: besides painting and embroidery she was Gorseth harpist from 1948 to 1953, and she kept (and liked) goats. She was philanthropic in the best sense, donating anonymously to works in Britain and supporting a group of black nuns in South Africa. By common consent she was an eccentric, but an eccentric of a scholarly and very British kind. Concerned with preserving the national heritage, her role in the Cornish language movement typifies her, reflecting both scholarship and a pragmatic romanticism. Her husband died in 1968&#151;they had no children&#151;and she herself died at the Kenwyn Nursing Home, New Mills Lane, Truro, Cornwall, on 13 November 1996.<br>
