<span class="headword">Gould,  Arthur Joseph</span>  (1864&#150;1919), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born on 10 October 1864 at 4 Bridge Street, Newport, Monmouthshire, the fourth of the twelve children of Joseph Gould (1833&#150;1892), brass-founder, of Oxford, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards, of Newport. He was born into an athletic family. Six of the boys played rugby for Newport, three of them for Wales: Robert (Bob) won eleven international caps (1882&#150;7), George Herbert (Bert) won three (1892&#150;3), and Arthur captained both club and country.<br>
<br>Nicknamed Monkey because of his agility as a boy in climbing trees, Arthur Gould captained the Newport junior side at fourteen, and played his first game for the senior team two years later, on 20 October 1882 against Weston-super-Mare. Having been selected at full-back, he ignored instructions to kick for safety and twice ran through the entire opposition to score. He was elusive and fast, and by 1890 he had scooped &pound;1000 in prize money at athletics' meetings; he was the midland counties Amateur Athletic Association sprint and hurdles champion in 1893. His employment as a public works contractor took him to various parts of the country, and he played rugby for Southampton Trojans, London Welsh, Richmond, Hampshire, and Middlesex, as well as Newport.<br>
<br>Gould's playing career was interrupted in 1890, when work took him to the West Indies. On his return, appearing regularly now at centre, he became Newport's highest scorer in their invincible season of 1891&#150;2, and between 1893 and 1895 under his captaincy the team lost only four games out of fifty-five. He was also a successful captain at international level, leading Wales to its first triple crown in 1893 by adopting the &#145;Welsh&#146; formation of four three-quarters. This style of play, pioneered by the Cardiff club, had not been a success in international rugby and Gould was not initially enamoured of it, but he recognized its potential for the kind of attacking game he favoured. Capped twenty-seven times for Wales between 1885 and 1897, Gould was one of the outstanding sportsmen of the late Victorian era. His brilliant all-round play was crucial to Wales's emergence as a force in international rugby, while his striking good looks&#151;penetrating eyes, dark curly hair, and a lithe 5 foot 11 inch frame&#151;earned him widespread adulation. Yet his admirers' determination to reward his achievements plunged British rugby into crisis from 1896 to 1898.<br>
<br>In 1896 a public subscription was opened in Gould's honour, and this received the blessing of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and drew contributions from as far afield as Australia and America. However, since Gould was still playing, the other home unions, contrary to the wishes of their own member clubs and hostile to any notion of rewarding players, broke off fixtures with Wales and demanded that the WRU declare the testimonial illegal. The Welsh union, however, asserted its right to manage its own affairs by participating fully in a gala occasion at the Drill Hall, Newport, on Easter Monday 1897. Here the president of the WRU, Sir J. T. D. Llewelyn, in the presence of 250 guests including civic and national dignitaries, presented Gould with the deeds of the house in which he lived, purchased with money raised by the subscription. The other unions were horrified. Seeking to defuse the situation, in January 1898 Gould announced his retirement and Wales was readmitted to the international fold, although it was not until 1899 that Scotland agreed to resume fixtures. Gould became a referee and a Welsh team selector, and kept his house.<br>
<br>In 1900 Gould married Lilian Augusta Smith, daughter of Samuel Smith, corn merchant, of Newport, and they had four children: Arthur Jack, Mary, Josephine, and Gwen. After his rugby career came to an end, he worked as a brewery clerk. He died of a haemorrhage on 2 January 1919 at home, Thornbury, 6 Llanthewy Road, Clytha Park, Newport, the house which had once caused such controversy. His funeral took place on 6 January at St John's Baptist Church, Newport, where he was a sidesman.<br>
