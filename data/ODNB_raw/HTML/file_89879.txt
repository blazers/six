</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Drew,  Joanna Marie</span>  (1929&#150;2003), <span class="occ">gallery director</span>, was born in Naini Tal, India, on 28 September 1929, the only daughter of (Francis) Greville Drew (1892&#150;1962), army officer, and his wife, Sannie Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sands (1903&#150;1969), painter, daughter of Charles Sands, policeman in India. She had an older brother, Anthony. Her early childhood was spent in India, but with time back in England when her father did a stint at the War Office in London from 1930 to 1934, and again when he assumed the western command from 1938 to 1940. She remained close to her mother and brother throughout her life, and lovingly commemorated her mother's work as an artist in a book produced with her nephew John Drew before her own death.<br>
<br>From the ages of ten to thirteen Drew attended Edinburgh Ladies' College. Given her background she took for granted that she would be parked at boarding school but, unusually, she was allowed to choose one for herself, and chose Dartington Hall. She felt herself privileged to be there, forged lifelong friendships, and forever viewed Dartington as a magical place. On leaving at the age of fifteen, she studied at the Ballet Rambert school for six months, but found it a merciful release when her knee gave out. Thinking she needed a decent qualification, her father ensured she was fitted up with a maths tutor, taught embroidery, and sent to Lausanne to improve her French. Her fluency in French and love of France never left her.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1946 Drew enrolled in a new course in the history and practice of art jointly established by the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh College of Art. Never under any illusion that she would be an artist, she nevertheless revelled in the course. Her belief in the importance of artistic practice&#151;she never lost the urge to draw in order better to understand a work of art&#151;and her contempt for those who only read books, were born, along with her legendary ability to reconcile the two. Her involvement in the University Art Society also set her professional course. With a few fellow students she succeeded in organizing two extraordinary exhibitions&#151;one of French and one of British modern painting&#151;borrowing major pictures from Douglas Cooper and Roland Penrose, and trundling them to Edinburgh by the carload. It was the first time the work of many modern painters had been seen in the city.<br>
<br>While working at Dartington as school secretary during the summer of 1952, Drew heard on the grapevine of a job going as a junior exhibition organizer at the Arts Council of Great Britain. Thinking herself a rank outsider with none of the then requisite Bloomsbury/Arts Council connections, she was astonished to be offered the post (a success she put down to having worn for the interview a straw hat piled with a riot of artificial roses and cherries that had been created by her mother). At that time, the Arts Council had a virtual monopoly on the provision of exhibitions throughout the country, and a missionary zeal in bringing contemporary art to the provinces. In any given year, Drew could be working on up to six shows simultaneously, for spaces as varied as the Royal Academy, the Tate, and the Victoria and Albert Museum (all then without exhibition-making abilities of their own), museums and galleries regionally, and the premises of the Arts Council's headquarters at 4 St James's Square.<br>
<br>Drew adored the variety of the programme, and relished the challenge of every project. Gabriel White (her first boss at the Arts Council), and particularly the writer and critic David Sylvester, with whom she first worked in 1954, encouraged her sensitivity to the way works were installed, learning to look and value what they gave out, and to get them to give their best through acutely sensed placements. The projects Drew was responsible for became increasingly ambitious, notably the exhibitions of Picasso at the Tate in 1960 and 1967. The 1960 Picasso show proved a landmark: loans from Russia were negotiated for the first time; visitor numbers to the exhibition were unprecedented; the queen asked to come to see it. But it was only in 1967 that Drew met the artist himself, when she oversaw return of his sculptures to his house in Mougins. Offered the opportunity to select a drawing for herself, in a panic she lunged toward <span class="italic">The Kiss</span>; Picasso immediately pronounced it &#145;bien choisi&#146; and inscribed it to her. She willed it to the Tate.<br>
<br>In 1968 the Arts Council moved to offices at 105 Piccadilly and commenced running of the new Hayward Gallery. Drew made her mark at the Hayward later that year through her organization of paintings and drawings from the collection of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam. The Arts Council's exhibition-making activity in London was from then on concentrated largely at the Hayward&#151;the Tate and other London galleries slowly becoming more active in their own right. The Hayward had consciously to build a programme and a reputation. Drew rapidly consolidated her position as the Arts Council's consummate exhibition organizer. She became assistant exhibitions director in 1970, and director of exhibitions in 1975, but her influence was pervasive and virtually unrelated to job title.<br>
<br>As the Hayward programme matured, every show had Drew's stamp on it, and the range of exhibitions was unrivalled. Other cultures were revealed in astonishing depth, as in &#145;The arts of Islam&#146; (1976) and &#145;In the image of man: the Indian perception of the universe through 2000 years of painting and sculpture&#146; (1982); contemporary British artists, among them Anthony Caro (1969) and Bridget Riley (1971), were given their first major exhibitions; thematic exhibitions such as &#145;Dada and surrealism reviewed&#146; (1978) redefined modern art history; there were pioneering re-examinations of historical figures; and the work of artists or periods less well known in Britain was quietly championed. Curatorially reticent herself, and never keen to impose her own aesthetic, Drew had no qualms about the Arts Council's role as facilitator; she counted on subject experts, writers, critics, and artists, herself providing organizational skills, judgement, wit, vivacity, and benevolent leadership. Owing to her friendships, notably with Ir&egrave;ne Bizot at the R&eacute;union des Mus&eacute;es Nationaux, the Hayward hosted exhibitions of Millet (1976), Pissarro (1980), Renoir (1985), and Toulouse-Lautrec (1991). Having no art collection as trade collateral, the Hayward traded on Drew's brilliance, integrity, and allegiances.<br>
<br>Drew's time as the Arts Council's director of art (1978&#150;86), in succession to Robin Campbell, was perhaps less personally satisfying than her earlier career, but equally significant. She had a formidable portfolio, overseeing exhibitions at the Hayward and Serpentine galleries in London, exhibitions nationally, the Arts Council collection, subsidies to galleries regionally, photography, publications, and artists' films. Tim Hilton called her &#145;unquestionably the most powerful individual in the British art scene&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 August 1992). She could be a shrewd operator. She was good at mustering her forces, and she normally won. But as art politics became more overt, she found the work increasingly tedious and missed working in the galleries.<br>
<br>In 1986 Margaret Thatcher's abolition of the metropolitan authorities and the demise of the Greater London council resulted in the creation of the South Bank Centre. The Arts Council's areas of direct provision&#151;exhibitions in London and nationally, and the Arts Council collection&#151;were duly transferred. Drew, whose heart had always been in exhibitions, became director, Hayward Gallery and regional exhibitions, at the South Bank Centre. Although she managed to turn her hand again to exhibitions, most directly in a beautiful retrospective of drawings by Andr&eacute; Masson organized with David Sylvester at the Hayward in 1987, it was a difficult period, with the Hayward's autonomy lessened and an emphasis on marketing and sponsorship which Drew found antipathetic. In 1992 she took early retirement.<br>
<br>Drew's belief in art as a life-giving force was infectious. Virtually single-handedly she inducted a whole generation of art professionals, never making them feel as if they were being instructed. She gave people freedom to operate, to make mistakes, and could seemingly effortlessly manage the youngest of whippersnappers and the biggest of egos. A dab hand at building teams and intuiting moods and feelings, she was also an astute committee woman, though reluctant to chair them herself. She was also a sage adviser, one-to-one and as a member of the British Council fine art committee and the council of the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>Though little interested in her appearance, Drew had a wonderful ability to transform herself from the likes of some dowdy eastern European museum official to someone quite glamorous. She was not self-conscious about sellotaping her shoes when the strap on her red sandals broke moments before she was due to take the queen mother round an exhibition. Her background had attuned her to the niceties of behaviour, and instilled a sense of deference&#151;making her modest to a fault&#151;and of public service. She hated pomposity but was a great respecter of authority; she could be bitterly disappointed when those she held in high regard turned out to be men of straw. Although a product of her class, she lived life informally, and had a totally engaging way of taking human beings as they were. She was interested in politics, as a &#145;steadily inactive sort of lib/lab pinkie&#146;  (O'Ryan), and had an innate sense of justice. Although she travelled widely, she baulked at visiting apartheid South Africa despite family connections. (Her maternal grandmother, Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Breytenbach, came originally from the Transvaal.)<br>
<br>A deeply private person, Drew's professional and personal lives were nevertheless much entwined. She would trundle her bags of policy papers from office to home&#151;57 St George's Square in Pimlico, the flat she rented in March 1953, eventually bought, and never left. Untouched by the modern world (the original cooker and dial phone served her to the end; there was radio but no television), it teemed with life and had something of the air of a Parisian garret, albeit infinitely brighter. At weekends she would escape to Wallingford, in Oxfordshire, where the house her mother had bought soon after her father's death became her home for close to thirty years. The garden would absorb her from breakfast to evening. Never prone to waste a thing, she moved the compost heap between London and Wallingford, and baskets of windfall apples would arrive in the office on Monday mornings. She was generous to a fault, whether bringing home-made soup to unwell friends or caring for her brother during his prolonged illness. Her love of France manifested itself in friendships, a proclivity to sport a beret, summers spent in Lacoste with her &#145;old man&#146; and non-cohabiting partner, the painter Peter de Francia (1921&#150;2012), and her ageing bright green Citro&euml;n 2CV, which saw her to Buckingham Palace to collect a CBE in 1985.<br>
<br>On retirement Drew made a quiet resolution not to join anything that required raising money. She found giving it away a happier position to be in, and devoted herself to the Elephant Trust, of which she had been a founding trustee, and the Henry Moore Foundation, whose donations and publications committees she chaired. She was a vehement champion of good writing, and particularly mourned the loss of writers of the calibre of Andrew Forge and David Sylvester&#151;of whose estate she was executor following his death in 2001. The sale at Sothebys of works of art from Sylvester's collection provided her with a last and treasured opportunity to organize an exhibition. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on Christmas eve 2002 and, after a short illness which she bore without self-pity, died on Easter Sunday, 20 April 2003, at Edenhall Marie Curie Hospice, in Camden, London. She was cremated at Golders Green crematorium in London on 30 April. She was, in the words of her friend Monika Kinley, &#145;Just about the only person in the art world everyone respected and loved&#146;  (private information).<br>
