<span class="headword">Nugent,  Richard</span>, third Baron Delvin  (<em>d.</em> 1538), <span class="occ">governor of Ireland</span>, was the son and heir of Christopher Nugent, second Baron Delvin, and Anne Preston, daughter of Robert, first Viscount Gormanston. The title's origins are obscure, but the feudal barony of Delvin was later deemed to include a peerage, making Richard Nugent twelfth feudal baron of Delvin and third Lord Delvin. He was perhaps under age when his father died of plague in 1478, but he was among the lords of Ireland circularized by Richard III in September 1484. Perhaps first summoned to the Irish parliament in 1486, he attended the parliaments of 1491, 1493, and 1499 when he was fined 40<i>s</i>. for absence from the second session at Castledermot. In May 1488 he was pardoned with other pale magnates for his role in the Lambert Simnel conspiracy the previous year.<br>
<br>The location of Delvin's estates in the north-west marches of Meath, notably the small but strategically situated barony of Delvin, meant that he was a key figure in the defence of the Meath Englishry, and by the 1490s his military reputation was growing. On 25 June 1496, as English military activity in Ireland wound down in the aftermath of Poynings's expedition, Delvin was appointed chief captain of the king's forces, with a salary of &pound;200 a year, pending Kildare's reappointment as governor. At the battle of Knockdoe in August 1504, he commanded the English cavalry stationed on the left flank of the main battle, and in the preliminary skirmishing he slew one of the Burkes with a casting spear. He apparently also served on the peace commission for Meath, and by 1522 he was a member of the king's council, although not normally a regular attender.<br>
<br>Despite his military prowess and political reliability, however, Delvin's meagre landed patrimony and localized <i>manraed</i> hampered his attempts to play more than a local role in the lordship's politics. He was one of the five or six most prominent Meath landowners, but despite recent acquisitions of marchland there, his exposed Westmeath estates yielded no more than &pound;80 a year, with perhaps the same from lands in co. Louth, and &pound;30 annually from scattered co. Dublin estates. Thus, after the king had chosen Delvin as acting governor of Ireland&#151;in the absence of the earls of Kildare and Ormond, who were summoned to court in another attempt to reconcile their differences&#151;he was soon in difficulties. In preparation for this new role, Delvin's landed influence in Westmeath was in September 1526 consolidated by a fifty-year lease for &pound;10 annually of the manors of Belgard and Four, of which he had earlier had the custody and which were worth &pound;44 a year. He had been absent from Ireland since June, presumably at court, but he assumed office in 1527, nominally as Kildare's deputy, superseding the earl's brother, Sir Thomas Fitzgerald. His relations with Kildare were so poor, however, that in 1524 the earl had been compelled to undertake not to stir up any war against him.<br>
<br>None the less, despite the weakness of his position, Delvin dealt high-handedly as governor with the Gaelic border chiefs. In retaliation for robberies on the Englishry&#151;stirred up by Kildare's supporters &#145;in the hope he should the rather come home&#146;&#151;Delvin withheld the blackrents traditionally paid to O'Connor Faly and O'Neill, against the council's advice  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 4, no. 3698). Consequently, &#145;this poor londe hathe taken great lostes and damagies this winter&#146;, according to Archbishop Inge and Chief Justice Bermingham in February 1528. Highlighting Delvin's inadequacies, they complained that &#145;the vice deputy is nat of power [i.e. lacks tenants] to defende the Englisshrie&#146;. He extended the incidence of coign and livery, so that &#145;the poor people is ferr more chargid and oppressed by hym than they have been, thErll of Kildare being here&#146;. Moreover, Delvin &#145;hathe no great londes of his owne&#146; and without the parliamentary subsidy which had recently expired, the revenues barely sufficed to pay officers' salaries  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.126).<br>
<br>Continuing raids by O'Connor Faly eventually led to a parley on 12 May 1528, by Sir William Darcy's border castle of Rathyn, where Delvin was kidnapped by the chief, his footmen slain, and his horsemen wounded or taken prisoner. O'Connor then refused to release the baron without a ransom and restoration of his blackrent. Lord Butler, who visited him at O'Connor's house on safe conduct, reported that Delvin was closely confined and only allowed to speak with him openly in Irish, so that their conversation could be understood. In the emergency Sir Thomas Fitzgerald was initially elected chief captain in Delvin's place, until the earl of Ossory's appointment as deputy in August. Yet by February 1529, when the deputy secured the council's agreement to peace with O'Connor and the restoration of his blackrent in return for Delvin's release, much of Meath had been wasted and destroyed by the chief.<br>
<br>After his release Delvin apparently withdrew from high politics. In November 1529 he agreed the marriage of his son and heir, Christopher, to Marian or Marion St Lawrence, Lord Howth's daughter, providing a jointure worth 20 marks annually in return for a dowry of 220 marks. Christopher died in 1531 but had nine children, presumably through an earlier marriage, including Richard, later fourth baron. Following the death of his first wife, Isabella Fitzgerald, Kildare's cousin, Delvin married Elizabeth St Lawrence (<i>d</i>. 1559), presumably Marion's sister, probably on 4 February 1531. In June 1534, however, another emergency following Thomas Fitzgerald's resignation and rebellion saw the veteran captain again elected governor by the council. He served unavailingly for eight weeks as the rebels consolidated their hold on the pale. Following the arrival of Lord Deputy Skeffington with the king's army in October, Delvin's local knowledge and military experience were more fruitfully employed in breaking down rebel resistance. Given command of one of the army garrisons, Delvin had by spring 1535 a general oversight of the defence of Meath. He participated in the final expedition to the borders of Offaly, signing the letter of 27 August to the king which described Thomas Fitzgerald's surrender, and later received 40 marks as the king's reward for his services.<br>
<br>Despite his advanced age Delvin remained remarkably active in the aftermath of the revolt, supervising the defence of Westmeath and participating in occasional expeditions. In May 1536, when he came up to parliament, Lord Deputy Grey refused Delvin and Lord Butler licence to repair to court because, after Ossory, they were &#145;the best and politic captains of the Englishry&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.317). Delvin distinguished himself in the deputy's hosting against O'Connor in June 1537, detaching O'Molloy, Mageoghegan, and O'Melaghlin, the chief's <i>uir-rioghtha</i> (vassal-chiefs) from him before conducting the army by an unusual route into Offaly, where the Dangan, O'Connor's strong new castle, was captured and razed. A similar hosting the following November was less successful, however, and tension developed between Grey and Delvin, resulting in a complete breach between them during a third hosting against O'Connor in February 1538. Against the advice of experienced marchers, Grey led the army into Offaly by a dangerous ford of the River Barrow, then in flood, ordering them to swim their horses across, whereupon some were lost. The baron, &#145;being an old man and an ancient captain&#146;, with other Meath lords refused to cross, at which Grey called them traitors and had them stripped of their horses, harness, and weapons, and left to shift for themselves in enemy country. This notorious incident later formed one of the more serious charges against Grey in 1540, but Delvin &#145;toke suche grief and fantasie of the said myshandelinges, and especiallie that the lorde deputie callid him traitor&#146; that he never recovered  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 3.37&#150;8). He lingered until 28 February 1538, and was buried in the local church of Castletown Delvin. His grandson Richard, then aged fourteen, succeeded him as fourth baron; but of his surviving younger sons, Thomas had already emerged as a resourceful marcher during his father's lifetime, and William, executor of his father's will, was the last prior of Fore and rector of Trim and Ardnurgher. Delvin's widow, Elizabeth, lived until 1 March 1559.<br>
<br>Later Tudor barons of Delvin had a pronounced interest in the Gaelic language and culture, but it is unclear whether the third baron shared these, beyond speaking the language. He was certainly a familiar figure in the Gaelic world, respected as &#145;ridire cr&oacute;dha cogthach&#146; (&#145;a brave and warlike knight&#146;) who provided &#145;sgiath didin ocus cliath ghaeithe Ghall re Gaeidheluibh&#146; (&#145;a shield of shelter and a windbreak to the English against the Irish&#146;; <span class="italic">Annals of Loch C&eacute;</span>, 2.310&#150;11). Among the Englishry, Delvin epitomized the traditional virtues of a border baron&#151;a shrewd mind, a good captain, a loyal English subject with numerous retainers&#151;at a time when these qualities were in short supply among the palesmen. Sir Anthony St Leger, reporting his death (eighteen days prematurely, as it transpired), described him as &#145;oon of the best marchers of this countre&#146;, adding that &#145;the kyngis highnes hath a grete losse of hym&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.546).<br>
