<span class="headword">McKane,  William</span>  (1921&#150;2004), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born on 18 February 1921 at 42 Church Street, Dundee, the son of Thomas McKane, textile engineer, and his wife, Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. Though <i>dux</i> (leading scholar) of Stobswell School, he left at fifteen to follow his father into the local jute mill of H. and A. Scott, serving as a clerk. Born into the Original Secession church, he decided to enter its ministry. His study for university entrance was completed towards the end of his war service in the RAF (1941&#150;5). He matriculated at St Andrews University in January 1946, and graduated MA in 1949 with honours in philosophy and English, having also secured a football blue in that year. During his three summer vacations he had also studied for the ministry at the Bible Training Institute in Glasgow and in 1949 he was ordained in the Original Secession church at Kilwinning, near Irvine. While minister there he travelled into Glasgow University daily, and in 1952 graduated MA with first-class honours in Semitic languages.<br>
<br>In Kilwinning McKane met Agnes Mathie Howie, a hospital nurse and daughter of a retired farmer, James Howie. They were married in his church on 3 July 1952, and later had three sons and two daughters. In the following year he took up an assistantship in Hebrew in Glasgow University, and completed a PhD in 1956 with a dissertation on &#145;The old Israelite community and the rise of the monarchy&#146;. That same year the Original Secession church rejoined the Church of Scotland, which it had left in 1733. McKane had supported the move and became a Church of Scotland minister, although his former congregation did not follow his lead.<br>
<br>Promoted lecturer (1956) and then senior lecturer (1965), McKane prepared four substantial publications while at Glasgow. His first book, <span class="italic">Al-Ghazali's Book of Fear and Hope</span> (1962), translated part of the Arabic &#145;Revival of the religious sciences&#146; by a late eleventh-century Islamic philosopher and mystic. The next two volumes had a wide readership. <span class="italic">I and II Samuel</span> (1963), in the <span class="roman">Torch Bible Commentary</span> series, may have looked back to research for his doctoral dissertation, but it also led on to <span class="italic">Prophets and Wise Men</span> (1965), which distinguished sharply between the empirical rationality of Israel's early sages and the more charismatic intuitions of its prophets, and laid a foundation for substantial works to follow. The first of these, <span class="italic">Proverbs: a New Approach</span> (1970), substantially prepared in Glasgow, provided equally rigorous treatment of the &#145;sentence literature&#146; that makes up so much of that book, as of the more extended &#145;instruction literature&#146; prominent in the opening nine chapters.<br>
<br>McKane was appointed in 1968 to the chair of Hebrew and Oriental languages at St Andrews University, where he taught until his retirement in 1990. His <span class="italic">Studies in the Patriarchal Narratives</span> was prepared earlier in that period (1979), <span class="italic">Selected Christian Hebraists</span> (ranging from Origen to Alexander Geddes) in 1989, while the essays in <span class="italic">A Late Harvest</span> (1995) grew in part out of the seminar on <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> theology that he conducted for much of his time at St Andrews. However, the most substantial component of McKane's academic legacy was represented by the two volumes on <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span> in the prestigious <span class="roman">International Critical Commentary</span> series (1986 and 1996). These embodied the fruits of a relentless interrogation of the ancient witnesses to a text that has come down to us in two remarkably different forms, as well as of medieval and modern commentators on these witnesses; and they themselves are an immensely rewarding and often stimulating&#151;but not an easy&#151;read. After <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span>, he published a commentary on the prophet Micah (1998); and until his death he was working on a commentary on <span class="roman">Job</span>.<br>
<br>Thoroughly appropriately, two published obituaries of McKane used in their assessment a typically Scottish double negative, &#145;did not shirk&#146;: one noting his refusal to avoid administrative responsibilities; the other his willingness to confront deep textual and theological problems. The distinction of his many-sided contributions was widely recognized in the St Andrews years. He served as dean of the faculty of divinity (1973&#150;7) and as president of the Society for Old Testament Study (1978), was elected a fellow of the British Academy (1980) and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1984), and served as the principal of St Mary's College (1982&#150;6). In 1984 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Edinburgh, received the British Academy's Burkitt medal a year later, and was presented with a Festschrift, <span class="italic">A Word in Season</span>, on his sixty-fifth birthday (1986). During 1987&#150;8 he was a fellow at the National Humanities Center, North Carolina, and he became a corresponding member of the G&ouml;ttinger Akademie der Wissenschaften in 1997. He served on the advisory board of <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft</span>, and from 1980 acted as chairman of the Peshitta committee of the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament.<br>
<br>McKane remained an enthusiastic sportsman. He played cricket for the staff teams in Glasgow and then St Andrews into his sixties, supported the university and Scottish national rugby teams at Murrayfield, was a member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and a keen hill walker. These, with music and literature, but most of all his family, gave him much greater pleasure than his several honours. Though to his family he was &#145;Dad in his study as usual&#146;, he could not resist coming out to kick a ball whenever grandchildren were around. He had never been a patient in hospital until he was taken to Ninewells, Dundee, the day before his death there of a heart attack on 4 September 2004. He was buried in Cameron church, just outside St Andrews, and was survived by his wife and their five children.<br>
