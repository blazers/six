<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bourdillon,  Thomas Duncan</span>  (1924&#150;1956), <span class="occ">mountaineer and physicist</span>, was born at 24 Norland Square, North Kensington, London, on 16 March 1924, the elder son of Robert Benedict Bourdillon (1889&#150;1971), scientist, and his wife, Harriet Ada Barnes. He was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and Balliol College, Oxford (1942&#150;4, 1948&#150;50), where his studies were interrupted by military service. During the Second World War he saw service in Greece and Egypt. In 1950, after leaving Oxford, where he obtained a third-class degree in physics, he was attached to the Ministry of Supply at Westcott, Buckinghamshire, where he worked on the development of rocket engines. On 15 March 1951 he married Jennifer Elizabeth Clapham Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1929), daughter of Ronald Clapham Thomas, bank official.<br>
<br>In 1951 Bourdillon accompanied Eric Shipton on the Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition which prospected a route through that peak's formidable southern defences, the Khumbu icefall in Nepal. During the trip he also climbed with W. H. Murray to the Nangpa La, a high pass on the Tibetan border, from where a possible route on nearby Cho Oyu was discerned. This was attempted the following year as a warm-up climb for Everest, again with Shipton as leader. Experimenting with oxygen apparatus on this expedition prompted Bourdillon to investigate the practicalities of a &#145;closed circuit&#146; system. This he developed in conjunction with his father, who worked at the Electro-Medical Research Unit, Stoke Mandeville. Racing against the clock, they produced eight prototype sets for the 1953 Everest expedition, led by John Hunt.<br>
<br>The principle of the closed-circuit system is that the climber receives 100 per cent oxygen from the bottle without air entering the face mask, as it does in the standard &#145;open-circuit&#146; apparatus. Expired carbon dioxide is &#145;scrubbed&#146; by passing through soda lime so that a proportion of the breathed oxygen is available for rebreathing, thus extending the life of each bottle of oxygen and reducing the number of bottles required by those using the apparatus. Tests on the mountain were encouraging and, with this closed-circuit system, Bourdillon and Charles Evans on 26 May 1953 made their prodigious climb from the south col to the south summit (28,700 feet) of Everest and back, opening the route for Hillary and Tenzing to go to the summit with open-circuit sets three days later, as the first climbers ever to do so.<br>
<br>Bourdillon&#151;who was described by friends as generous, cheerful, unruffled, dependable, and &#145;too shy&#146;, and by Hunt in <span class="italic">The Ascent of Everest</span> (1953) as &#145;huge and hefty, built like a second-row rugby forward&#146;&#151;had climbing in his blood. His father was a founder member of the Oxford University mountaineering club in 1909. Sir Arnold Lunn told the story (in <span class="italic">A Century of Mountaineering</span>, 1957) that on the premise that &#145;a scientist must know something about electricity&#146;, Bourdillon senior was put in charge of the club's lantern for showing lantern slides; when young Bourdillon joined the club, he too was appointed &#145;lanternist&#146; to maintain the tradition. An outstanding rock climber and an enthusiast for the new vogue of &#145;artificial climbing&#146; which so shocked traditionalists, Bourdillon was at the forefront of a post-war renaissance in British alpinism. He took on some of the most difficult alpine routes of the day (north face of Dru, Mer de Glace face of Gr&eacute;pon by Aig du Roc), and he became the first president of the &eacute;lite Alpine Climbing Group (1954&#150;6), which did so much to raise the profile of British mountaineers on the international stage.<br>
<br>Bourdillon was killed&#151;along with another fine British climber, Richard Viney&#151;in a climbing accident on 29 July 1956 while ascending the east buttress of the J&auml;gihorn in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland. His widow, their daughter aged nineteen months, and son of ten weeks survived him.<br>
