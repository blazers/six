<span class="headword">Riviere <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Verrall]</span>,  Joan Hodgson</span>  (1883&#150;1962), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst</span>, was born at 52 Brunswick Square, Hove, Brighton, Sussex, on 28 June 1883, the eldest of the three surviving children of Hugh John Verrall (1854&#150;1909), solicitor, and his wife, Anna (1854&#150;1947), daughter of John Willoughby Hodgson, vicar of Chalgrave, Bedfordshire. Hugh John Verrall belonged to an established Sussex family with literary connections; an older brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36646/', "Arthur Woollgar Verrall")</script>, was an eminent classical scholar, fellow, and tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge. Joan Verrall's education was unconventional, even for late Victorian times: after being taught at home (1888&#150;94) by her mother, a former governess, and a period at school at St Michael's Hall, Brighton, she attended Wycombe Abbey School. This was followed, when she was seventeen years old, by a year in Gotha, Germany. There she gained the remarkable command of German that enabled her to translate Freud's psychoanalytic writings into fluent and expressive English. In 1906 she married Evelyn Riviere (1876&#150;1945), a barrister, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35766/', "Briton Riviere RA (1840&#150;1920)")</script>, a well-known painter of his day. They had one child, a daughter, Diana (1908&#150;1989).<br>
<br>Although she did not go to university Joan Riviere took a great interest in intellectual, literary, and artistic endeavours. Before she became a psychoanalyst she worked for a time as a court dressmaker with the firm of Nettleship. She was also involved in movements for social change, such as divorce reform and suffragette activities. She attended meetings of the Society for Psychical Research and the Medico-Psychological Society. The aim of the latter was to alleviate nervous disorders with practices derived from psychoanalysis. Therapeutic psychoanalysis was developing in England during and after the First World War, mainly through the work of Ernest Jones, a close colleague, and later biographer, of Freud. Joan Riviere sought help for her own emotional problems, which had become acute after the death of her father, by having an analysis with Jones from 1916 to 1921. Jones was so impressed with Riviere's deep and sensitive understanding of psychoanalytic principles and processes that he referred patients to her in 1919, and she became a founder member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, formed that year.<br>
<br>Riviere's analysis with Jones was not straightforward. She fell in love with him but experienced a painful rejection when she made her feelings known to him. Jones referred her to Freud for analysis and wrote:<blockquote>I underestimated the uncontrollability of her emotional reactions and in the first year made the serious error of lending her my country cottage for a week when I was not there, she having nowhere to go for a holiday. This led to a declaration of love and to the broken-hearted cry that she had never been rejected before (she has been the mistress of a number of men). From that time on she devoted herself to torturing me without any intermission and with considerable success and ingenuity, being a fiendish sadist &hellip; The treatment finally broke down over my inability to master this negative transference, though I tried all means in my power. (Appignanesi and Forrester, 355)</blockquote>Freud replied that he found her to be not &#145;half as black as you have painted her&#146;  (ibid.). Her analysis with Freud took place in Vienna in 1922; he later offered Jones his diagnosis:<blockquote>Let us turn to Mrs Riviere. If she were a sheer <i>intriguante</i> she would have insisted on her sweetness with me until she had got out of me all she needed. Now she did not. She soon became harsh, unpleasant, critical even with me, tried to provoke me as she had done with you. I made it a rule never to get angry at her. Now I cannot give you the result of our analysis, it is not yet definite or complete. But one important point soon emerged. She cannot tolerate praise, triumph or success, not any better than failure, blame and repudiation. (ibid., p. 357)</blockquote>Riviere had by this time already played a significant part in bringing Freud's work to the attention of the English. They had met for the first time in The Hague in 1920 and the first edition of the <span class="italic">International Journal of Psycho-Analysis</span>, published in the same year, contained an article by him that she had translated. She had translated other papers of Freud before she went to him for analysis. After she returned to London she translated many of the papers which constitute the five volumes of Freud's <span class="italic">Collected Papers</span>. She is also noted for the stylistic sensitivity with which she translated his monumental work <span class="italic">Civilisation and its Discontents</span>. Freud considered her to be the most sensitive and creative of his translators and preferred her work to that of all others  (&#145;Letters from Sigmund Freud&#146;). It is also clear that he admired her, describing her as &#145;clever and clear-headed&#146;, &#145;a powerful helpmate&#146;, &#145;a real power and &hellip; a concentrated acid&#146;  (Appignanesi and Forrester, 354).<br>
<br>Riviere played a very important part in the work of the British Psycho-Analytical Society. She became a training analyst in 1930; Susan Isaacs, John Bowlby, and Donald Winnicott were among those she analysed. As a supervising psychoanalyst she was an inspiring teacher as well as an original thinker, &#145;with a gift for articulating her understanding clearly and convincingly&#146; as Hanna Segal found  (Segal). Riviere set a high standard for herself and others in everything to which she turned her attention. She was generous in praise where she saw its appropriateness, although she could be scathing when she saw slipshod or careless work, as Ernest Jones discovered when she commented on his biography of Freud.<br>
<br>Riviere's contribution to psychoanalysis as a translator of Freud's works is important, but the part she played in relation to the development and expression of Melanie Klein's ideas is of greater significance. Klein extended Freud's concepts of mental mechanisms and processes to the understanding of infancy. Her analyses of young children confirmed her theories relating to the importance of the first year of life for psychic development. Klein had arrived in London from Europe in 1926. As an established member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society Joan Riviere was in a position to provide the professional support that Klein was much in need of at that time. With her excellent command of English Riviere became the most articulate exponent of Klein's theories, the most able among her colleagues to express Klein's ideas clearly, vividly, and with conviction. Her remarkable ability to put Klein's theories into the context of Freud's discoveries is illustrated in her paper &#145;The genesis of psychical conflict in earliest infancy&#146; (1936). She delivered the paper in Vienna in honour of Freud's eightieth birthday.<br>
<br>Riviere's understanding of Klein's views on child analysis led her to criticize Anna Freud's approach to the analysis of children. Her contribution to a symposium on child analysis in 1927 made Sigmund Freud extremely angry. The differences in the two approaches are fundamental and concern the timing of the development of the superego and the child's relationship to the parents in its internal world. Klein's and Anna Freud's differences in theory and technique were further clarified by Riviere's contributions at the time of the British Psycho-Analytical Society's controversial discussions in the early 1940s. Riviere's ability to make complex theoretical insights persuasively straightforward helped to resolve the conflict, and was appreciatively described by Appignanesi and Forrester in their valuable chapter on Riviere in <span class="italic">Freud's Women</span> (1992).<br>
<br>Riviere contributed many bold and original ideas to the body of psychoanalytical thought. The most important and original of these is &#145;A contribution to the analysis of the negative therapeutic reaction&#146; (1936). In this paper Riviere incorporates Klein's findings relating to the depressive position. That is, the stage in which the infant develops an awareness of his or her separateness from others, and understands that he or she has an emotional relationship with them. In this paper Riviere describes for the first time the concept of a defensive organization seen as a protection against psychic pain. This highly organized system of defence against a more or less unconscious depressive condition serves as a disguise to conceal the latter. The idea of an organized system of defence has commanded the interest of successive generations of psychoanalysts who continued to investigate the phenomenon for many years after it was first defined by Riviere.<br>
<br>&#145;Femininity as a masquerade&#146; (1929) examines an area of sexual development in which the femininity of certain women can be found to be a mask, assumed to hide rivalry with and hatred of men. Fraudulent femininity covers a wish for masculinity that must be hidden out of a fear of retribution. In her paper &#145;Jealousy as a mechanism of defence&#146; (1932) Riviere addressed further problems of female sexuality by describing the envious spoiling that underlies seeming Oedipal jealousy. In this she is paving the way for Klein's later work on envy and gratitude. Riviere greatly admired Freud's capacity to explore and to see what is unknown to us and yet what is so powerful in determining our lives, the unconscious. However, she could also take him to task for his views of women and for his emphases on their phallic insufficiencies, as in her incisive review of one of his books (1934). Although she was not directly involved in the emancipation of women, Riviere's contributions to the understanding of the complexities of women's sexual development came to be increasingly valued.<br>
<br>Riviere was an impressively handsome woman, tall, elegant, and beautifully dressed. She had what some have called a rather aloof and, at times, formidable manner, but behind the aloofness lay an essential modesty and shyness. Riviere had a deep appreciation of the function of art, drama, and literature as a form of contact between internal and external realities. She wrote two important papers on the subject in 1952. In these she showed how, through poetry and prose, art and drama, the inner world of dreams, phantasy, and the unconscious, finds expression.<br>
<br>As one of the pioneer group of British women psychoanalysts Joan Riviere played an important part in the acceptance of psychoanalytical ideas in the wider world. Her appreciation of the creative works of Freud and Klein, which she translated and interpreted with great eloquence, led her to her own considerable creativity. Through her innovative writings and teaching she originated many themes in psychoanalytical thought that continue to be explored. Riviere continued to work until her death at Flat 1, 199 Sussex Gardens, Paddington, London, on 20 May 1962. She was buried on 24 May. A memorial meeting was held later at the Institute of Psycho-Analysis.<br>
