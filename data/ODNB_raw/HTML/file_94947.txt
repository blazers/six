<span class="headword">Sarabhai family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1820&#150;<em>c.</em>2000), <span class="occ">industrialists and philanthropists in India</span>, can trace its origins to <a name="cosubject_96936"></a><span class="headword">Karamchand Premchand</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1834)<span class="occ"></span>, whose firm, Karamchand Premchand ni phedi, financed indigenous manufactures and advanced loans to the peshwas, the gaekwads, and other Indian rulers. It operated an all-India network of offices, bought opium from Malwa in central India, exported it to China, and in return purchased Chinese silk and tea which was sold in England. This trade was at first extremely profitable but by the mid-nineteenth century, because of growing competition from Chinese producers and also from Indian merchants, it was no longer so. Under the East India Company's rule the indigenous <i>sarafs</i> started losing business as bankers and as moneylenders. The finance that became available from this dwindling business now found its way to the mechanized textile industry.<br>
<br>Karamchand died when his son <a name="cosubject_96937"></a><span class="headword">Maganbhai Karamchand</span>  (1823&#150;1864) was only eleven years old, and the young Maganbhai had to take charge of the business. Among Maganbhai's investments was a share in the first textile mill in Ahmadabad, founded by Ranchhodlal Chhotalal in 1861. Apart from being a successful <span class="occ">entrepreneur</span>, Maganbhai was a philanthropist who donated Rs 20,000 for the first girls' school in Ahmadabad. He also contributed towards the funding of Gujarat College. A devout Jain, he founded a <i>pathshala</i> (school) for the study of Jainism and donated money for building Jain temples. Shortly before his death he donated a lakh of rupees (Rs 100,000) for different religious and charitable purposes. It is said that when his <i>haveli</i> (house) caught fire, diamonds and other precious stones tumbled out of the beams.<br>
<br>As Maganbhai had no son, he adopted his daughter's son, <a name="cosubject_96938"></a><span class="headword">Sarabhai</span>  (1864&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span>. When Maganbhai died Sarabhai was still an infant and was cared for by his trustees, among whom were Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, second baronet, and Sheth Umabhai Hathisingh, who also nurtured the family business. In 1876 the first mechanized cloth printing factory in Ahmadabad, the Ahmadabad Calico Printing Company Limited, was established as a small venture by eight promoters, among whom was the firm of Karamchand Premchand. The factory ran into financial difficulties and in 1880 was taken into voluntary liquidation. Karamchand Premchand, which was the largest lender, acquired the printing works from the liquidators and floated a new company, adding cotton spinning and then weaving to cloth printing. Thus the Ahmadabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Company was established. It soon developed into the thriving concern popularly known as Calico Mills, on which the Sarabhai family fortune was built. In 1881 Sarabhai left his studies to take charge of the family business. In his short life, apart from managing Calico Mills, he served as a member of the Ahmadabad municipality and was for some time secretary of the Maganbhai Kanyashala, the girls' school founded by his adoptive father. In his will he donated a substantial sum for distribution to foundlings' homes.<br>
<br>Only three months after Sarabhai's death his wife, Godavariba, died, leaving behind three children&#151;Anasuya [<i>see below</i>], then nine years old, Ambalal [<i>see below</i>], aged five, and Kumud Kishore, known as Kanta, who was still an infant. They were brought up with great affection but under strict discipline by their uncle Chimanbhai, Sarabhai's younger brother.<br>
<br>It was Chimanbhai who in 1904 built what became the Sarabhai family home, The Retreat, built on 21 acres of farmland in Shaibag, near Ahmadabad, and remodelled in 1935 by Suren Kar, the architect who designed Rabindranath Tagore's house in Santiniketan. The palatial house had a beautiful garden adorned with replicas of Greek and Roman statues, fountains, and ponds with fish and lotuses; exotic flowers, trees, and bushes were planted, and there were peacocks and birds of various kinds.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_96939"></a><span class="headword">Ambalal Sarabhai</span>  (1890&#150;1967) reached his majority at the end of 1908, the same year that Chimanbhai died, and took all affairs pertaining to family, caste, and business into his own hands. Ambalal was an <span class="occ">entrepeneurial industrial magnate</span>, who very successfully managed Calico and Jubilee Mills and started Swastik Oil Mills, Sarabhai Chemicals, Suhrid Geigy, Sarabhai Merck Ltd, and several other businesses. He believed in professional management. He had a wide range of intellectual and cultural interests and was fond of reading; about 50,000 books on a wide variety of subjects were collected in his library. He loved intelligent conversation and meeting talented people in different fields. Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Nobel laureates Rabindranath Tagore and Sir Venkata Raman all stayed at The Retreat at one time or another; indeed, the guest list there read like an Indian <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. Ambalal was a liberal rationalist and a believer in individual freedom and women's equality. In 1910 he married Rewa, later named Sarladevi (1896&#150;1975), daughter of Harilal Gosalia, an advocate from Rajkot. When Ambalal met her he asked her if she wanted to marry him of her own free will, and only when she answered in the affirmative did they agree to marry. It proved to be a very happy marriage. Sarladevi had a tremendous sense of family duty and devoted her early years to looking after her husband and children and managing a huge home. Ambalal insisted on taking her and his sisters wherever he went socially, a courtesy he extended to his cousins, Indumati and Vasumati, Chimanbhai's daughters. Ambalal also fully supported his sisters when their marriages failed. When the marriage of Kanta proved disastrous, she returned to her brother's home, but she died at a young age.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_96940"></a><span class="headword">Anasuya Sarabhai</span>  (1885&#150;1972) had an unfortunate child marriage and refused to live with her husband. An independent and rebellious woman, she wanted a life of her own. Supported by her brother, she went to England in 1911 to study medicine. When she realized that this would involve animal dissection, however, being a Jain and a vegetarian, she gave up her medical studies. Instead she attended lectures at the London School of Economics and was influenced by Fabian socialism and the suffragettes. After her return to India, she worked among the textile labourers in Ahmadabad, led the first textile workers' strike in 1917, and called on Gandhi to mediate. She set up the Ahmadabad Textile Labour Union (Majoor Mahajan Sangh) in 1920 on Gandhian lines.<br>
<br>To learn more about the English textile industry Ambalal, accompanied by his family, went to England twice, and the family became somewhat Anglicized. Ambalal wore suits tailored in Savile Row and Sarladevi wore French chiffon saris. They bought European furniture and imported crockery and silver cutlery from England. But then came Gandhi, and the Sarabhai family's life was transformed. Ambalal rescued Gandhi's ashram at Kochrab, near Ahmadabad, from a financial crisis when other funding dried up because Gandhi had admitted an &#145;untouchable&#146; family. The Sarabhai family came under Gandhi's spell and by the 1930s all foreign goods were boycotted and many members of the family took to wearing <i>khadi</i>, participated in the freedom struggle, and went to jail.<br>
<br>Ambalal and Sarladevi were devoted to their eight children, Mridula (1911&#150;1974), Bharati (1912&#150;1986), Suhrid (1913&#150;1942), Leena (<i>b</i>. 1915), Gautam (1917&#150;1995), Vikram (1919&#150;1971), Geeta (<i>b</i>. 1921), and Gira (<i>b</i>. 1923), and deeply interested in their education and upbringing. Sarladevi was influenced by the educational ideas of Maria Montessori and Tagore. Finding no suitable school, Sarladevi and Ambalal started one for their children in The Retreat and appointed the best teachers available, including two Cambridge graduates, Edwin Standing and a Miss Williams. Each child was taught individually, with the result that each of them developed his or her own talents and interests. Mridula, the eldest, joined the freedom struggle, was close to Gandhi and Nehru, went to jail several times, and served on the All-India Congress Committee as a delegate from Gujarat. At the time of the partition of India in 1947 she took up the cause of abducted women, and later became involved in the Kashmir issue. Her sister Bharati was a poet and writer. Suhrid entered his father's business, but died young. Leena's interest was in education and she started Shreyas School in Ahmadabad, providing education based on the Montessori method and the educational ideas of Tagore. Gautam was interested in mathematics, philosophy, and art. Vikram was a physicist, instrumental in establishing the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmadabad, and widely regarded as the father of the Indian space programme. (His wife, Mrinalini, and daughter, Mallika, achieved equal fame as exponents of Indian classical dance). Geeta was interested in classical Indian music and Gira's interest was in art, textiles, and architecture. Bharati and Suhrid went to Oxford, Gautam and Vikram to Cambridge, Leena to Santiniketan, Mridula to the Gujarat Vidyapith, Geeta to a music school, and Gira to Frank Lloyd Wright's school in the USA. The diverse interests of Ambalal's children led to a gradual decline of the family business. Nevertheless the family's connections with Ahmadabad remained strong, and Ambalal and Sarladevi's children contributed to the building of some leading institutions there, including Jyoti Sangh and Vikas Griha (social welfare organizations founded by Mridula), the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmadabad, the Ahmadabad Textile Research Association, the Nehru Centre for Science and Development (founded by Vikram), the Calico Museum of Textiles, and the Sarabhai Foundation (founded by Gautam and Gira).<br>
