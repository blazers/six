</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moscheles,  Ignaz</span>  (1794&#150;1870), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born in Prague on 23 May 1794, one of five children of a Jewish cloth merchant, Joachim Moscheles (<i>d</i>. 24 April 1805). He was given the Jewish name Isack, but used the name Ignaz. His main studies were with the director of the Prague conservatory, Bed&#345;ich Divi&#353; Weber. In 1808, partly impelled by what was to be a lifelong admiration for Beethoven, he moved to Vienna, where he studied further with J. A. Streicher, Albrechtsberger, and Salieri. By 1814 he was established as one of the most successful of the city's young piano virtuosos. His tours took him to many European cities, and on 26 May 1821 to England, where for a quarter of a century he was at the centre of British musical life.<br>
<br>Moscheles was first heard in England at a Philharmonic concert in London on 11 June 1821, when he played his popular variations <span class="italic">La marche d'Alexandre</span> and his second piano concerto (in E[flat], op. 56). A brilliant improviser, he based his technique (as his widely used studies show) on the classical precepts of Clementi and others while anticipating the new developments of Chopin and Liszt. The best of his music is to be found in his sonatas rather than in his concertos or virtuoso ephemera. In London he formed friendships with Clementi (whose pianos he favoured), J. B. Cramer, Ries, and Kalkbrenner, and was soon a central figure in London music-making and in the world of other visiting and immigrant musicians. Further appearances followed, and on leaving England in the following year he was given a new passport by Prince Eszterhazy with the title &#145;Kammervirtuos&#146;. He spent the summer in France, returning to London after the Paris concert season, and making his first reappearance with Cramer in a duet sonata to which he contributed a movement (on this occasion using a Broadwood piano to suit Cramer's style). He was taken up again by fashionable London and played at many soir&eacute;es but also gave his own concerts; he was elected an honorary member of the London Academy of Music and, by his own account, came to feel increasingly at home in England. After another winter in France he returned in January, spending time in Bath and Bristol as well as in London. He gave lessons, played at the oratorio concerts, and, though much of his time was taken up with trivia, worked on compositions including his fourth piano concerto (in E major, op. 64). He left England again at the end of the season, in August.<br>
<br>Further European tours brought Moscheles into contact with many musicians, among them the young Mendelssohn, to whom he gave lessons and who became his closest friend. In Hamburg he met and, on 1 March 1825, married, an amateur pianist, Charlotte Embden (1805&#150;1889); they moved to England on 2 May 1825. Country visits included stays at Stoneham Park, Southampton (where he was a guest with Palmerston), Cheltenham, and Oxford, before they settled at 77 Norton Street, London; here their household belongings included a piano presented by Clementi. In 1830 they moved to 3 Chester Place, Regent's Park. A happy and mutually supportive couple, they were generous hosts, and Moscheles always lived up to his principle that colleagues should play for one another without a fee. He showed great kindness to the dying Carl Maria von Weber, in London in 1826 for the first performance of <span class="italic">Oberon</span>, then helped Sir George Smart with Weber's funeral arrangements; and Mendelssohn, on his first visit to England, wrote in detail of the couple's careful attention to his wants, adding &#145;Beide sind die Freundlichkeit selbst&#146; (&#145;They are both kindness itself&#146;; letter to his father, 25 April 1829). Moscheles was often host to Mendelssohn, who stood godfather to his son Felix; they gave a number of concerts together, and shared the conductorship of the Birmingham Festival in 1846. Among many other artists visiting London who benefited from his hospitality were Paganini, Spohr, and Liszt. He also toured widely, including a visit to Ireland (he found the Irish more musically receptive than the English), and wrote as a consequence his <span class="italic">Souvenirs d'Irlande</span> (op. 69, 1826). This was followed by <span class="italic">Ankl&auml;nge aus Schottland</span> (op. 75, 1826) and a <span class="italic">Fantaisie sur des airs des bardes &eacute;cossais</span> (op. 80, 1828). The latter arose partly from a visit to Edinburgh and to Sir Walter Scott. Despite differences over the musical capabilities of the bagpipes, their friendly exchanges included translations of B&uuml;rger and Grillparzer which Scott made for Moscheles's album; he later gratefully accepted the dedication of the <span class="italic">Fantaisie</span>.<br>
<br>The pattern of Moscheles's London life continued in similar fashion for some years, with residence in England sometimes interrupted by summer tours on the continent. Much of his time was taken up with recitals in grand houses and at court. In 1828 he played at Kensington Palace to the duchess of Kent, the young Princess Victoria being sent to bed after his second piece. On many occasions he was irked by the English lack of respect for those performing, as demonstrated at a soir&eacute;e on 14 April 1832 after the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> where the audience included the duke of Wellington and &#145;the whole Tory party&#146;, and at another on 12 December before the king at Brighton Pavilion. He taught the piano at the Royal Academy of Music and developed a circle of talented pupils, including Litolff and Thalberg; he had many aristocratic pupils, but others included a greengrocer's daughter who had been rejected elsewhere. He conducted the Philharmonic Society (1821&#150;46, co-director 1832&#150;41), and, having raised a subscription of &pound;100 from the society to send to the dying Beethoven, continued his services to the composer he admired above all others by conducting the English premi&egrave;re of the <span class="italic">Missa solemnis</span> in 1832 (a private performance on Christmas eve at the house of the amateur musician Alsager in Queen Square). He also translated Anton Schindler's <span class="italic">Biographie von Ludwig Van Beethoven</span> (1840) into English (1841) (the jealously protective Schindler later wrote a mendacious attack upon him). His concerts included, from 1837, pioneering &#145;historical soir&eacute;es&#146; at which, well in advance of his time, he would play Bach and Scarlatti on the harpsichord. Thanks to Sir George Smart, he was enabled to attend Queen Victoria's coronation on 28 June 1838 by singing as a bass in the choir. He began to withdraw from public performance in 1840.<br>
<br>To widely expressed regret, Moscheles and his family left England in 1846 on his acceptance of the post of professor of piano at the Leipzig conservatory (though they made brief return visits). His contribution to English musical life was substantial, at least as much for his encouragement of foreign artists as for his own compositions and concerts. He was very companionable, at ease in English society, and in turn was held in warm regard: he and his wife, who was also very well liked, &#145;held weekly receptions on a large scale, at which &#147;society&#148;, musicians, painters, and literary people of distinction, were wont to foregather&#146;  (Kuhe, 76). The diaries and letters copiously quoted in his wife's biography of him, <span class="italic">Aus Moscheles' Leben</span> (1872, trans. 1873), give a lively and sympathetic account of English musical life in the twenty-five years between 1821 and 1846. Moscheles died in Leipzig on 10 March 1870.<br>
