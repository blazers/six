<span class="headword">Meyer, Sir  Carl Ferdinand</span>, first baronet  (1851&#150;1922), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born at Hamburg, Germany, on 23 December 1851, the second son of Siegmund Meyer (1815&#150;1882) and his wife, Elise Rosa (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of Reuben Hahn. He was educated abroad and went to London in 1872 to work as a clerk at Rothschilds' merchant bank. On 14 March 1883 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58576/', "Adele Meyer (1862/3&#150;1930)")</script>, daughter of Julius Levis, merchant, of London; they had a son and daughter.<br>
<br>At Rothschilds, Meyer's promotion to senior clerk was rapid and he carried a partner's workload. Particular concerns were Rothschilds' extensive yet unlikely finance of southern African diamond and gold mining and the 1886 formation of the pioneering and immensely successful Exploration Company. He handled Rothschilds' relationship from 1887 with Cecil Rhodes, which began his lifelong association with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. As a De Beers director from shortly after its formation, he experienced headlong conflict with Rhodes and his South African cronies in seeking to impose good business practice. Meyer became a major figure in mining finance, acting as director of several southern African companies. He served as deputy chairman of De Beers from 1888 to 1921.<br>
<br>At Rothschilds Meyer grew close to another of their allies, Sir Ernest Cassel, and the two worked on bond issues for foreign governments. But in the mid-1890s, when Cassel failed to persuade Rothschilds to back his Egyptian projects, such as the Aswan Dam, he drifted away from them, and in 1896 took Meyer with him. They remained lifelong friends and collaborators. Meyer, whom Rothschilds kept out of their partnership and were happy to see sit in their general office until at least 1890, was pleased to go, but he did so on good terms and continued as their representative on several boards. However, in allowing his departure, Rothschilds deprived themselves of vital leadership for a generation. He worked with Cassel on the successful Egyptian projects and in 1898 was appointed a director to watch over Cassel's substantial interest in his newly promoted National Bank of Egypt. Henceforth Meyer operated from the bank's London head office and remained a director until his death.<br>
<br>Meyer's interests also extended to China, then a battlefield on which the imperial powers fought for economic influence. He was chairman of the Pekin Syndicate Ltd, formed in 1897 to operate concessions for railways and mines, and regarded as a major instrument of British influence. This led to Meyer's 1899 appointment to the London committee of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and, in 1904, to his directorship of Central China Railways Ltd. However, the Pekin Syndicate made slow progress, and in 1910 Meyer fell victim to the machinations of French shareholders who forced his resignation, although he held on to his railway company directorship until 1914.<br>
<br>Away from business, Meyer's interests included music, shooting, and racehorse-owning, while in London his connections included the National Hospital and the Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre (which eventually opened in 1963 as the National Theatre). His promotion of the latter in 1909 with the first contribution, of &pound;70,000, to a &pound;500,000 building fund was rewarded with a baronetcy a year later. About 1905 he acquired a country estate, Shortgrove, at Newport, Essex, and he became a county figure, sitting on the bench, and supporting Newport grammar school and Saffron Walden Hospital. His wife&#151;&#145;a society beauty fashionably interested in movements and causes&#146;  (Kynaston, 2.331)&#151;was active in local affairs and, further afield, was a well-informed chair of the St Pancras School for Mothers. With his wife he was an enthusiastic patron of opera and a discriminating collector of pictures. He had a neat, dapper appearance.<br>
<br>Despite being a naturalized British subject since 1877 and having his son on active service, Meyer suffered great prejudice during the First World War. Following the torpedoing of the <i>Lusitania</i> in 1915, he led hundreds of former German citizens in declaring in <span class="italic">The Times</span> loyalty to the crown and detestation of German methods of warfare, but to little effect. Depressed by ostracism, his health broke down in 1916, when the Hongkong Bank was quick to encourage his resignation. In 1918 his fellow magistrates gave him the benefit of the doubt over the hoarding of 56 lbs of tea.<br>
<br>Meyer died at his London home, 12 Park Crescent, Portland Place, on 18 December 1922. He was survived by his wife. Although born into a Jewish family, he received a Christian burial at St Marylebone cemetery, East Finchley, on 22 December, and his death went uncommented upon by the Jewish press. His son, Frank, succeeded him in the baronetcy.<br>
