<span class="headword">Sheilds,  Alexander</span>  (1659/60&#150;1700), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Haughhead, Earlston, Berwickshire, the son of a farmer, James Shields. Alexander attended Edinburgh University, graduating MA on 7 April 1675 &#145;with no small applause&#146;. After graduation he remained to study theology at Edinburgh under the tutelage of Lawrence Charteris, the son of Principal Henry Charteris, who like his father taught divinity at the university until he resigned because of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> which forced many covenanters from office. In 1679 Sheild's own covenanting convictions led him, along with others, to flee Scotland for the Netherlands where, in 1680, he continued his theological studies at Utrecht.<br>
<br>After returning to Scotland he went to London, where he served as amanuensis to John Owen, the puritan theologian. Sheilds was licensed to preach by Scottish Presbyterians in London on the persuasion of Nicholas Blaikie, the minister of the Scottish church at Founder's Hall, Lothbury. However, Sheilds's unwillingness as a covenanter to take the oath of allegiance, and his preaching against such an oath, brought him to the attention of authorities who after 1684 sought strict enforcement of the oath. His name became linked in November 1684 to that of James Renwick initially through Sheilds's adherence to the &#145;Apologetical declaration&#146; issued by the United Societies, an affiliation of covenanters to which Renwick belonged.<br>
<br>Sheilds was arrested by the city marshal at an illegal conventicle at Embroiderers' Hall, Gutter Lane, in Cheapside, on 11 January 1685, along with seven others. He was granted bail to appear at the Guildhall on 14 January. Sheilds failed to appear before the court and consequently forfeited his bail. He did appear on 20 January, but gave no account of his views and was committed to Newgate until the next quarter sessions, which were to be held on 23 February. Following Charles II's death on 6 February the decision was made to remit Sheilds and his compatriots to Scotland's judgment on 5 March, without benefit of an English trial. He was examined by the Scottish privy council on 14 March and subsequently (23 and 25 March) also by the lords justices. In all of these appearances Sheilds reportedly declined &#145;direct answers&#146;. Finally, on 26 March, he was forced on pain of torture to sign the statement he described as his &#145;fatal fall&#146;, renouncing all activities in which he engaged &#145;in so far as they declare war against the king&#146;. Unfortunately for him, a letter to his friend John Balfour of Kinloch, in which he expressed his regret at having falsely signed this statement, was intercepted by officials who sent archbishops Arthur Ross and Alexander Cairncross and Bishop Andrew Bruce to question Sheilds. On 6 August Sheilds was again brought before the lords justices who sentenced him to imprisonment on the Bass Rock. After fourteen months' imprisonment he escaped in November 1686 disguised as a woman and sought out James Renwick.<br>
<br>Despite Sheilds's defection and &#145;fall&#146; Renwick accepted him back into the covenanters' fold and helped him to regain the trust of members of the societies. Sheilds assisted in revising the &#145;Informatory vindication&#146;, the classic apologetical text of the Cameronians or Society people. Sheilds's own book, <span class="italic">A Hind Let Loose</span>, also written at this time, offers a historical defence of the position he and Renwick took. Sheilds reveals the depths of his own struggle with this position in his 22 December confession to a gathering of Renwick's followers of the guilt he suffered for &#145;owning the so-called authority of James VII&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1687 Sheilds returned to Utrecht to seek the publication of both the &#145;Informatory vindication&#146; and his own work, travelling back to Scotland when both books were at press (both were published in 1687). Upon publication, <span class="italic">A Hind Let Loose</span> was so feared by authorities in Edinburgh that copies were ordered to be destroyed. After Renwick was executed at the Grassmarket, Edinburgh, on 17 February 1688 on a charge of treason, Sheilds engaged in the same kind of open field preaching which had characterized Renwick's work. In April 1688 he denounced the execution at a gathering at Distinkhorn Hill in Galston parish, Kyle Stewart, and memorialized Renwick in <span class="italic">An Elegie upon the Death of Mr. James Renwick</span> (1688) and at greater length in the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Mr. James Renwick</span> (1724).<br>
<br>Sheilds became a vigorous apologist for the Cameronians and, with Thomas Lining and William Boyd, served as one of the societies' three ministers. He approved of the societies' 1688 insurrection under the leadership of Daniel Ker, in which ministers of churches in the west of Scotland were forcibly removed from their charges. He was present at a gathering at the cross of Douglas, Lanarkshire, where these activities were defended, and he provided a vindication of the position taken by the societies with regard to their refusal to adhere to the ministers who had taken the declarations of indulgence, whom they regarded as Erastian. Sheilds and the societies became champions of the cause of William of Orange, in support of whom the Cameronian regiment was raised to fight against James in the revolution of 1688. On 3 March 1689, along with Lining and Boyd, Sheilds took part in a renewal of the covenants at Borland Hill, Lanarkshire, of which he wrote <span class="italic">The Renovation of the Covenant at Boreland</span> (1689).<br>
<br>In 1690 Sheilds finally decided that he should become reconciled to the Church of Scotland: thus Sheilds, Lining, and Boyd presented two documents to the first general assembly under the Presbyterian settlement. The first consisted of a collection of grievances which the assembly refused to read publicly so as not &#145;to kindle contentions&#146;. The second document set out terms of submission on the part of the societies' three ministers, marking their recognition that the reconstituted Church of Scotland was a true church and requesting that they be received into its fellowship. The submission was dated 22 October; it was accepted by the assembly three days later, when the assembly admonished Sheilds and his colleagues &#145;to walk orderly in time coming&#146;.<br>
<br>Sheilds received an appointment on 4 February 1691 to serve as chaplain to the Cameronian regiment raised in 1689 by James, earl of Angus. On the same day he was called to serve with Thomas Forrester in the parish of St Andrews, though he was not admitted to this charge until 15 September 1697. This was Sheilds only charge to a parish ministry, and he remained there for just under two years before a commission of the general assembly authorized him to accompany three other ministers and a group of colonists to the Darien (or New Caledonia) Colony in Central America &#145;to labour among the heathen&#146;. Sailing from Rothesay on 24 September the company, including Sheilds and his brother Michael, reached Darien on 30 November, but not before no less than 160 of their number had died at sea. In a letter to the moderator of the commission of the general assembly Sheilds reported that &#145;one hundred and thirty are sick on shore and forty or fifty are dead already&#146;. The colonists &#145;do scandalise the natives&#146;, Sheilds continued, &#145;by stealing from them and by teaching them both to swear and drink&#146;. The only people about whom Sheilds was able to report positively were the indigenous people themselves, whose hospitality and kindness particularly impressed him  (Barr, 243). Sheilds's work as a missionary was cut short when, after only a few inland expeditions, he travelled to Jamaica with Francis Borland and there contracted a fever. He died on 14 June 1700 in the home of Isabel Murray, a fellow Scot, at Port Royal, Jamaica. By the time of his death at the age of forty, &#145;much lamented by all those who knew his worth and parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 1.400), Sheilds had given up on the mission and was determined to return to Britain.<br>
<br>Among his other books to be published after his death were <span class="italic">Church Communion Enquired Into</span> (1706) and the autobiographical tract <span class="italic">True and Faithful Relation of the Sufferings of Alexander Shields</span> (1715).<br>
