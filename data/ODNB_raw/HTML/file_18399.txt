<span class="headword">Maxse, Sir  Henry Berkeley Fitzhardinge</span>  (1832&#150;1883), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was the son of James Maxse (1792&#150;1864), a wealthy landowner, and his wife, Lady Caroline Fitzhardinge (1803&#150;1886), the daughter of the fifth earl of Berkeley. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18398/', "Frederick Augustus Maxse")</script> was his brother. Henry Maxse entered the army on 1 June 1849 as a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, but changed on 11 June 1852 to the 13th light dragoons and on 6 July to the 21st foot. He became captain in the Coldstream Guards on 29 December 1854, and in the same year was ordered to the Crimea. He served throughout the Crimean War as aide-de-campe to Lord Cardigan, was present at the battles of Alma and Balaklava (where he was wounded) and at the siege of Sevastopol, and won the Crimean medal and clasps, besides Turkish medals and the decoration of the fifth class of the Mejidiye. In 1855 he became a major. In 1863 he was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel, but he bought himself out of the army on 22 December 1873.<br>
<br>In 1863 Maxse went to Heligoland as lieutenant-governor, and was appointed governor there on 6 February 1864. His long tenure as governor coincided with an eventful period in the island's history. The reformed constitution was established in 1868, the gaming tables were abolished in 1870, and Maxse had to face the consequent financial difficulties and complaints of the islanders. During his administration Heligoland was also linked by telegraph cable to the mainland. He was made CMG in 1874, and KCMG in 1877.<br>
<br>In 1881 Maxse became governor of Newfoundland, but he never really settled there. He was interested in Germany: he married the daughter of a Herr von Rudloff, spent a part of every year in Germany, and translated into English Bismarck's letters to his wife and sisters from the period 1844 to 1870. He was also fond of acting, and took part in amateur dramatics. He died at St John's, Newfoundland, on 10 September 1883. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34956/', "Leopold James Maxse")</script> was his nephew.<br>
