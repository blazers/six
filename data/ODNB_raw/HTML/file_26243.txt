<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Charles</span>, fourth earl of Harrington  (1780&#150;1851), <span class="occ">dandy</span>, was born at Harrington House, Craig's Court, Charing Cross, London, on 8 April 1780, the eldest of the seven sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26242/', "Charles Stanhope, third earl of Harrington (1753&#150;1829)")</script>, army officer, and his wife, the heiress Jane Fleming (1755&#150;1824). Two of his sisters married the dukes of Bedford and Leinster. One of the duchess of Bedford's nephews wrote that had the third earl of Harrington &#145;staid at home, tended his farms and educated his sons and daughters the former might not have been the disreputable scamps they are, and the ignorance and low minds of the latter would have been corrected by education&#146;  (Blakiston, 491). Viscount Petersham, as he was styled until 1829, was educated at Eton College before joining the Coldstream Guards in 1795. He was promoted captain in the prince of Wales's light dragoons (1799), major, the Queen's rangers (1803), lieutenant-colonel, 3rd West India regiment (1807), and was placed on half pay in 1812, becoming colonel in the army in 1814.<br>
<br>Petersham was a close companion of the prince regent, later George IV. He was a lord of the bedchamber to the incapacitated George III between 1812 and 1820, and to George IV from 1820 to 1829. He was a great dandy, affecting the immaculate dress, exaggerated manners, and eccentricities of behaviour of his kind, and featured frequently in contemporary prints. He wore distinctive hats, designed the overcoat that became known as the petersham, was a connoisseur of both tea and snuff, and pursued women with more drama than discretion. Princess Lieven recounted his wooing of a Mrs Brown, by purchasing &#145;a brown carriage, brown livery, brown hat, brown spurs, brown harness&#146; and brown court dress, embroidered with dead leaves; when Mr Brown discovered the affair, he thrashed Petersham in the street  (Quennell, 105&#150;6). Petersham succeeded as fourth earl of Harrington in 1829. A devotee of the stage, on 7 April 1831 he married the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9807/', "Maria Foote (1797&#150;1867)")</script>, who had been his mistress for some time; she was the daughter of the theatre manager Samuel T. Foote. Their son was born the following December, but died in 1836; their daughter, Jane, was to marry the third Marquess Conyngham. The new Lady Harrington was too notorious to appear in society, and they lived in seclusion at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire, where Harrington devoted himself to landscape gardening and gothicizing the castle. He appeared in the House of Lords occasionally and bestirred himself to oppose the repeal of the corn laws in 1842. Harrington died in Brighton on 3 March 1851 and was succeeded by his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26250/', "Leicester Stanhope")</script>.<br>
