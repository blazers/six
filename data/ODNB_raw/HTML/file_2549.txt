<span class="headword">Blackwood,  John</span>  (1818&#150;1879), <span class="occ">publisher and journal editor</span>, was born on 7 December 1818 at Salisbury Road, Edinburgh, the sixth son of Janet Steuart (1779&#150;1849) and the publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2550/', "William Blackwood (1776&#150;1834)")</script>. Educated at Edinburgh high school (1826&#150;31), the alma mater of Walter Scott, and at the University of Edinburgh (1831&#150;5), John Blackwood subsequently undertook a three-year tour of continental Europe, accompanied in part by his brothers Robert and Alexander, and chaperoned by his classics tutor, William Hay. On his return in 1838, John Blackwood began an apprenticeship with the London publishers George Whitaker &amp; Co., where he remained until 1840. In December of that year Robert and Alexander, by then heads of the Blackwood firm, decided to open a London office at 22 Pall Mall, and John, now a partner in the firm, was chosen to run it. Over the next five and a half years he established the firm's presence in the capital, making close personal connections with, among others, William Thackeray, Laurence Lockhart, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and John Delane, later to become editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Through Delane, with whom he shared lodgings for several years, he was introduced to writers who were later to form a core grouping of <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> contributors, including generals Edward Bruce Hamley and William Hamley, Frederick Hardman (French correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>), and Laurence Oliphant.<br>
<br>In July 1845, four months after the death of his brother Alexander, John Blackwood returned to Edinburgh to take over as editor of <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. In 1852, on the death of Robert Blackwood, John assumed control of the firm, working in partnership with his brother Major William Blackwood, who had returned from India in 1848 to manage financial matters. Now financially secure, John Blackwood married Julia Blandford in 1854 and moved into the New Town dwelling of 3 Randolph Crescent. They had a son, John, and a daughter, Mary, who was to write the publishing memoirs of her father in 1898. After Major Blackwood's death from pneumonia in 1861, John reorganized the family business, making his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38928/', "William Blackwood (1836&#150;1912)")</script> a co-partner, and establishing a four-strong editorial team along with William, his London office manager, Joseph Munt Langford, and the Edinburgh office manager, George Simpson. Between them, they strengthened the firm's lists and established its magazine at the forefront of mid-Victorian literary production.<br>
<br>John Blackwood's editorial flair, warmth of character, and friendly openness led to important and lasting literary relationships with leading authors of the mid-nineteenth century. Although conservative and paternalistic in manner, during his thirty-one-year career he was to gain the trust of, and publish, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Lever, Charles Reade, Richard D. Blackmore, Thomas Hardy, Margaret Oliphant, George Henry Lewes, and George Eliot, among others. Anthony Trollope, seeking a place for experimental work, anonymously serialized <span class="italic">Nina Balatka</span> (1867) and <span class="italic">Linda Tressel</span> (1868) in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. The experiments were not a success, and it would be another ten years before Trollope's work featured again in the magazine.<br>
<br>Under John Blackwood's guidance, the firm also became involved in publishing travel and exploration works. James Augustus Grant and John Hanning Speke's accounts of searching for the Nile River source in Africa were best-sellers for the firm in 1864 and 1865. Between 1852 and 1879, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> featured Frederick Hardman on Africa, Richard Burton on India and east Africa, Sir Henry Brackenbury on the Second Anglo-Asante War, Sir Garnet Wolseley on expeditions in Canada and Egypt, and Laurence Oliphant on Japan and the Crimea. But it was undoubtedly John Blackwood's connection with George Eliot, begun in 1857 with the anonymous publication in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> of <span class="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life</span>, which was to be one of his greatest contributions to British literary culture; with the exception of <span class="italic">Romola</span>, John Blackwood was to publish all of her major novels. Although relationships between the author and publisher proved at times fraught and difficult, the result was an unusually strong and personal connection that lasted until Blackwood's death on 29 October 1879 at Strathtyrum, St Andrews, his country home for twenty years. He was buried on 5 November 1879 in the family mausoleum on Calton Hill in Edinburgh.<br>
