<span class="headword">Newton,  William</span>  (1822&#150;1876), <span class="occ">trade unionist and journalist</span>, was born in Congleton, Cheshire, the son of William Newton, a skilled engineer. He began an engineering apprenticeship at Kirk's foundry, Etruria, Staffordshire, at the age of fourteen, became a member of the Journeymen Steam Engine and Machine Makers' Society in 1840, and shortly afterwards moved to London. In 1842 he married Emma, daughter of Samuel Baxter, a labourer; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In the course of the 1840s Newton worked his way up the trade to the position of foreman but his prominent role in union affairs resulted in his dismissal in 1848. Newton then took over the Phoenix tavern, Ratcliffe Cross, which was already the meeting place of the east London branch of the Steam Engine Makers, and used this position both further to extend the influence of the union and to launch himself into politics.<br>
<br>In his trade union activities Newton was a close colleague of William Allan, who became general secretary of the Steam Engine Makers in 1848, and together they led the movement towards the fusion of a number of craft organizations into the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) in 1851, with Newton's own contribution being largely that of a persuasive publicist. In 1851 and the early part of 1852 he published and edited <span class="italic">The Operative</span>, a weekly paper which pressed the case for amalgamation. On the ASE's executive council it was Newton who moved the pioneering motion &#145;that all engineers, machinists, millwrights, smiths and pattern-makers cease to work systematic overtime and piece-work after 31 December 1851&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>, 2.270). This sparked off the widely publicized &#145;lock-out&#146; by the employers, which began on 10 January 1852 with the employers in London and Lancashire closing their works.<br>
<br>During the dispute Newton gave powerful speeches at important meetings throughout the country; a gathering at the Manchester Free Trade Hall was said to be &#145;the greatest indoor meeting ever held by the working class of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>, 2.270). In accounting for the ASE's eventual defeat Newton later emphasized the contribution of hostile reports in the press. However, it is clear that the union was quite unprepared to withstand a long dispute. As a result of his experience, Newton became for several years a strong advocate of producers' co-operatives instead of unequal industrial conflicts.<br>
<br>Though not directly involved in the union's affairs after its dramatic launch, Newton continued as a prominent spokesman for its case. He was active on the committee which secured the first legal recognition for trade unions under a friendly societies' act of 1855, and he gave evidence as an engineer before the select committee on masters and servants in 1856. During the London builders' dispute in 1859 a major attack on trade unions was made by the Edinburgh MP Adam Black in a lecture entitled &#145;Wages, trade unions and strikes&#146;. A speech refuting Black's unsubstantiated allegations about the ASE was made by Newton in Edinburgh, and was later published. In 1867 Newton chaired the meeting called to formulate the engineers' response to the royal commission on trade unions.<br>
<br>In his political activities Newton played a leading part in the earliest movements for labour representation, considerably aided by his talents for speaking and journalism. In the 1852 general election in the Tower Hamlets constituency he became the country's first independent labour candidate and, though he came bottom of the poll behind two sitting middle-class radicals and a Liberal, his involvement in the engineering trade's dispute and his personal appearances on the hustings gathered him over 1000 votes. He then floated the idea of a new &#145;national party&#146; to press for manhood suffrage as the key to the solution of labour's problems but, though he received some support in trade union and Christian socialist circles in London, he failed to convince the national Chartist leaders of the value of collaborating with middle-class radicals in pursuit of a single issue at this time.<br>
<br>Undaunted, Newton continued to press for political reform through his other newspaper ventures, <span class="italic">The Englishman</span> (1853&#150;4) and the <span class="italic">East London Observer</span> (1858&#150;76), becoming president of the Labour Representation League and an enthusiastic Gladstonian Liberal. In the 1868 general election he stood again for Tower Hamlets, this time as a radical Liberal with strong local support, but once again came bottom of the poll, this time partly because of faction fighting within the labour movement itself. His final unsuccessful attempt to enter parliament was in a straight fight against a Conservative at a by-election in Ipswich in 1875; his candidature testified to his national standing, reflected both in his having been invited by the local branch of the Labour Representation League and in the wider interest shown in his campaign speeches.<br>
<br>Newton was much more successful in local politics. He was a member and subsequently chairman of the Stepney vestry, and from 1862 until his death served as the Mile End vestry's representative on the Metropolitan Board of Works, which he also eventually chaired. Both in his committee work on such public services as sanitation and water supply, and in his newspaper coverage of poor-law issues, he was a champion of coherent London-wide policies. One of his contributions to the debate on London local government in 1870, calling for &#145;one great central authority&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>, 2.273), was widely circulated, and he consistently advocated the equalization of local poor rates to prevent the heaviest financial burdens falling on the districts of the city least able to pay.<br>
<br>William Newton was an important pioneer of labour organization in both the industrial and the political spheres. He was a heavily bearded, thoughtful-looking man, remembered for his remarkable eloquence, which allowed him both to inspire masses of men with large ideas and to persuade committees about detailed schemes. However, little is recorded about his personal life. He died at his home, 41 Stepney Green, London, on 9 March 1876, having been ill for a while with a number of complaints, including Bright's disease. He was survived by his wife.<br>
