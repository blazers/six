<span class="headword">McCausland,  Dominick</span>  (1806&#150;1873), <span class="occ">judge and religious writer</span>, was born at his father's residence, Roe Park, co. Londonderry, on 20 August 1806, the third of four sons of Marcus Langford McCausland and his wife, a daughter of John Kennedy of Cultra, co. Down, and aunt of Sir Arthur Edward Kennedy. His father died when McCausland was still an infant and he was taught at the Revd Dr Moore's school, Parkhill, Gloucestershire, and for two years at the Royal School, Dungannon. In 1822 he went to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1827, winning the gold medal for science in his year. He proceeded LLD and LLB in 1859. Ill health contributed to his missing a fellowship, and he went on a tour of the continent for two years.<br>
<br>After his tour McCausland returned to Ireland to study law and was called to the Irish bar in 1835. He selected the north-western circuit, and became QC in 1860. In the second administration of Lord Derby (1858&#150;9), McCausland was appointed crown prosecutor, and immediately afterwards was elected &#145;father&#146;, or president, of the circuit bar. Notwithstanding the demands of a busy practice he found time to write several religious works, including <span class="italic">On the Latter Days of the Jewish Church and Nation, as Revealed in the Apocalypse</span> (1841), and <span class="italic">The Times of the Gentiles as Revealed in the Apocalypse</span> (1852). These works were later republished in a combined second edition as <span class="italic">The Latter Days of Jerusalem and Rome as Revealed in the Apocalypse</span>. Other works were <span class="italic">Sermons in Stones</span> (1856), which went into thirteen editions, <span class="italic">Adam and the Adamite</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">The Builders of Babel</span> (1871). McCausland died at his home, 12 Fitzgibbon Street, Dublin, on 28 June 1873, and was buried at St George's, Dublin, on 1 July. His wife, Emily, and at least three of their sons, survived him.<br>
