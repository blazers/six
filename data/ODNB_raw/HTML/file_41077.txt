<span class="headword">Champion,  Harry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>William Henry Crump]</span>  (1865&#150;1942), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was probably the William Henry Crump born at 30 Grafton Street, Mile End, London, on 8 April 1865, the son of Walter Henry Crump, a tailor who was later a butcher and licensed victualler, and his wife, Louisa Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scantlebury. He had at least one brother and sister, who both outlived him. Few personal details are known about Champion's early life, as &#145;about his real name he was secretive&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Jan 1942). He was apprenticed to a boot clicker. Nevertheless his main interest was the music-hall, and he made his d&eacute;but at the Royal Victoria Music Hall in Old Ford Road, Bethnal Green, in July 1882, as &#145;Will Conray, comic&#146;. He toured round the minor halls of London's East End, variously described as comic, character vocalist, and character comic and dancer, and the following year ventured into other parts of the capital. He probably appeared in these early days in &#145;blackface&#146;, at least in part when he sang plantation songs.<br>
<br>Late in 1886 Champion introduced a new act entitled &#145;From Light to Dark&#146;, in which he appeared alternately in black- and whiteface. This had some success, but a real change came in 1887 when he deserted the name of Will Conray for Harry Champion:<blockquote>Somebody gave it to me. It was all through a dislike the manager of the Marylebone took to me. I went on tour for a bit. When I came back, he told my agent he'd have nothing to do with me. &#145;Right&#146;, said the agent, &#145;but you might give a new man his chance.&#146; &#145;Who is he?&#146; asked the manager, and then and there my agent baptised me &#145;Harry Champion&#146; and came and told me afterwards. (Disher, 64&#150;5)</blockquote>Real success came in 1889 when Champion gave up the blackface part of his act and found the first song which came to be associated with his name: &#145;I'm Selling up the 'Appy 'Ome&#146;. His network of engagements in the country widened and he made his West End d&eacute;but at the Tivoli in September 1890. Encores of his now famous song were often accompanied with a hornpipe dance. His renown throughout his career centred on his singing with verve and gusto songs which became closely associated with his name, one of the most notable being &#145;When the Old Dun Cow caught Fire&#146;, introduced in 1893.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1889, at St Peter's Church, Hackney, Champion married Sarah Potteweld (1869&#150;1928), who accompanied him on many of his tours. They had three sons and a daughter, all of whom were alive at the time of their father's death. In 1914 Champion moved his home from the East End to 520 West Green Road, South Tottenham, and he lived in the Downhills area of Tottenham for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>His songs were in demand: &#145;Champion is a comic singer who is endowed with genuine humour, which is revealed in his several songs, of which the audience never seems to get enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Entr'Acte</span>, 13 Jan 1894). He now had many songs in his repertory, a fact which may have prompted him early in 1898 to adopt the quickfire style of delivery which he retained for the remainder of his career: &#145;At one time I used to sing songs with plenty of patter but I changed the style for a new idea of my own, and started &#147;quick singing&#148;. I think I am the only comedian who sings songs all in a lump, as you may say&#146;  (Barker, 35). With his eccentric make-up and outlandish clothes, he became known as the &#145;Quick-Fire Comedian&#146;; he also tap-danced.<br>
<br>The titles of many of Champion's songs, supplied mainly by professional writers from his ideas, have become part of the British vocabulary. Those about food were an essential part of his repertory, so much so that about the time of the First World War it was possible to go into a cheap London restaurant and ask for &#145;a Harry Champion&#146;; and be given a plate of boiled beef and carrots, echoing the title of one of his most famous songs. Other ditties praised cucumbers, pickled onions, piccalilli, saveloys, trotters, cold pork, and baked sheep's heart, all basic elements in the cockney's diet.<br>
<br>Champion's golden period was from 1910 to 1915, when he introduced successful new songs before an ever widening and appreciative audience (&#145;Ginger you're Barmy&#146; and &#145;I'm Henery the Eighth, I am&#146;, 1910; &#145;Any Old Iron&#146;, 1911; &#145;The End of my Old Cigar&#146; and &#145;Wotcher, me Old Brown Son&#146;, 1914; &#145;Little Bit of Cucumber&#146;, 1915). He took part in the first royal variety performance at the Palace Theatre, London, in July 1912. &#145;Grow some Taters&#146; (1915) was taken up by the government wartime publicity organization to encourage the home growing of vegetables.<br>
<br>However, the First World War changed tastes, and traditional music-hall went into a decline in comparison with other forms of entertainment; by 1918 Champion and his fellow entertainers from the previous century were no longer in demand. In 1920 he went into an enforced retirement and did not expect another engagement. He took this stoically, concentrating his interest on horses and on running livery stables and a taxi service. These he owned for decades, operated in conjunction with relatives, at Dalston, London.<br>
<br>The public mood had changed again by 1930 and the old-timers of music-hall once again became popular. Troupes of veterans were much in demand in the 1930s, and Lew Lake's &#145;Variety, 1906&#150;1931&#151;Stars who Never Failed to Shine&#146; went on tour throughout the country early in the decade with Champion a leading member. &#145;He almost brought the house down with three of his typical ditties&#146;, reported <span class="italic">The Performer</span> on 6 May 1931.<br>
<br>Champion appeared at the royal variety performance in 1932 with other representatives of old-style music-hall, including Vesta Victoria, Fred Russell, and Marie Kendall. That same year he returned to the London Palladium, where he always sang &#145;Any Old Iron&#146; to rapturous applause. Further royal variety performance appearances took place in 1935 and 1938, and he was seen in the successful <span class="italic">London Rhapsody</span> with the Crazy Gang at the Palladium in 1937&#150;8.<br>
<br>Champion did not try anything new because that was not required by audiences in the 1930s. On stage the words shot out of him like bullets from a gun. He rattled off several songs in a monotonous voice, whirling his arms about with his foot tapping at the same time; he was always audible. He appeared grotesque, but was the embodiment of the spirit of the poorer parts of London; there was no refinement or sophistication in his performance, which was above all a vibrant evocation of working-class life. &#145;Like music hall itself, Harry Champion was of the people, he expressed the tastes of practically all his listeners, even those who would not openly admit it, and in World War 2 he sang to troops who found him a splendid tonic&#146;  (Pope, 406).<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Champion became a regular performer on the radio, and seemed indestructible. By late 1941, however, he had overtaxed his physical resources, and exhaustion forced him into a London nursing home, at 20 Devonshire Place, St Marylebone. He died there on 14 January 1942, having in a career of sixty years added several catchphrases to the English language. His most famous song, &#145;Any Old Iron&#146;, returned to popularity in the late 1950s, sung by Peter Sellers, to engage the attention of yet another generation. He was buried with his wife (who had predeceased him on 24 January 1928) in St Marylebone cemetery, East Finchley, on 24 January 1942.<br>
