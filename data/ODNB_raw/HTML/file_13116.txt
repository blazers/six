<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hervey,  John</span>, second Baron Hervey of Ickworth  (1696&#150;1743), <span class="occ">courtier and writer</span>, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13117/', "John Hervey, first earl of Bristol (1665&#150;1751)")</script>, and his second wife, Elizabeth Felton (1676&#150;1741), was born on 15 October 1696 at Jermyn Street, London, and baptized on 25 October. Known as Jack in his youth, he had two half-siblings, including a brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13110/', "Carr Hervey")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13117/', "Hervey, John, first earl of Bristol")</script>], and sixteen full siblings, ten of whom survived to adulthood, among them the politician and pamphleteer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13119/', "Thomas Hervey")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandentryintopolitics17101750"></a>Early life and entry into politics, 1710&#150;1750</h2>In childhood Hervey honed his skills as a jockey and a card player. But since his health was poor, he acquired much of his formal education at the hands of private tutors at Ickworth in Suffolk, entering Westminster School only in 1712 at the age of fifteen. A year later he matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, and in 1715 graduated MA. Queen Anne died while he was at university, and a Latin poem he penned to commemorate the accession of George I, besides being the first surviving piece of his writing, is evidence that he had already accepted the family's allegiance to whiggery. On the accession of the house of Hanover his father was made earl of Bristol.<br>
<br>Following university, Hervey visited continental Europe, staying in Paris and then Hanover. The latter was an unusual spot on the grand tour, but Lord Bristol hoped that attendance on the new king, who was spending a vacation at Herrenhausen, might be politically useful for his son. In addition to George I, Hervey met two other persons at Hanover who would play important roles in his later life: the king's grandson, Prince Frederick, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of Edward Wortley Montagu, Britain's minister to Constantinople. For a while there was talk of a career in the army, but these designs came to nothing. On 21 April 1720 Hervey married the attractive but unwealthy Mary Lepell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13118/', "Hervey, Mary (1699/1700&#150;1768)")</script>], the daughter of an army officer and one of the maids of honour to the princess of Wales. Because the marriage was financially imprudent, Hervey kept it a secret from all but his closest relatives for six months. The first of the couple's eight children was born on 3 August 1721 and given the redoubtably whiggish name of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13112/', "George William Hervey")</script>. Their second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13109/', "Augustus John Hervey")</script>, became a naval officer and politician. Meanwhile, by selling South Sea stock in a timely way, Hervey realized a &pound;20,000 profit from the stock's meteoric appreciation. When his half-brother Carr died unmarried on 14 November 1723, Hervey acquired the courtesy title of Baron Hervey of Ickworth and became heir to the Bristol earldom. On 2 April 1725 he was elected MP for Bury St Edmunds, virtually a family seat previously held by his father and by Carr Hervey.<br>
<br>Soon thereafter Hervey purchased a house in Great Burlington Street, London, and entered the Commons as a supporter of Sir Robert Walpole. He represented the chamber in a conference with the Lords and wrote a public tract on the government's behalf. He sealed his close political friendship with Walpole in 1727 by supporting the first minister even when most observers thought the accession of George II meant the end of Sir Robert's career. But then in July 1728, just when it appeared that political opportunities were opening up for him, Hervey left England for the continent, visiting Paris, Rome, and Florence. Publicly he pleaded ill health to explain the trip; in fact it was designed to allow him to be with Stephen Fox, brother of Henry Fox, later Baron Holland, the young man for whom he had developed a passion. On his return to England in October 1729 Hervey was a reinvigorated man and resumed his activities in support of Walpole, especially during the fierce debates over French construction at Dunkirk. On 7 May 1730, in recognition of several years of assistance, Lord Hervey became vice-chamberlain to the king's household and, consequently, a member of the privy council.<h2>
<a name="Vicechamberlainandlordprivyseal17301743"></a>Vice-chamberlain and lord privy seal, 1730&#150;1743</h2>Hervey's duties as vice-chamberlain obliged him to spend much time with Queen Caroline, a person whom he liked and respected. She reciprocated, appreciative of the pleasures that his intelligent conversation introduced into a court of dullards. Soon they were almost inseparable. Hervey hoped the vice-chamberlaincy would be a stepping stone to higher office, but, precisely because his influence with the queen was considerable and his value as a conduit between court and ministry was deemed irreplaceable, Walpole kept him in his office as long as the queen was alive. The most important professional assignment to come his way during his tenure was to oversee the arrangements for the marriage of Princess Anne, the princess royal, to the prince of Orange in 1737. But Hervey also had important political assignments, serving Sir Robert during these years as a reliable member of parliament. His loyal defence of the prime minister in the heated debates over the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> in 1733 earned him elevation, in his father's barony, to the House of Lords on 12 June of that year. In subsequent years he regularly endorsed the ministry's military and financial measures, even when he privately doubted the wisdom of Sir Robert's policies. Meanwhile, in 1733 he began writing the work now known as his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>.<br>
<br>The most celebrated aspects of Hervey's life in the early 1730s, however, turned upon three notorious quarrels. The earliest involved William Pulteney and concerned politics. In casting his political lot with Walpole, Hervey had broken with Pulteney, a rising whig politician who, before 1727, had been so close a friend to Hervey that he had stood as godfather to one of Hervey's daughters. The break became violent on 25 January 1731, when the two men, having already been associated with an exchange of personal insults in a pamphlet debate, duelled at sword-point in Green Park, London. Each wounded the other; indeed, had Pulteney not slipped before the seconds intervened, he would probably have killed Hervey. The second quarrel involved Frederick, prince of Wales, and turned in part on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28083/', "Anne Vane (d. 1736)")</script>, a woman with whom Hervey and the prince conducted concurrent affairs in 1731. Like Pulteney, the prince began his relationship with Hervey on friendly terms, but the covert character of the simultaneous liaisons further complicated a friendship already burdened by Hervey's close ties with Frederick's distant mother, the queen, and the two men became cordial enemies. By the mid-1730s a common contempt for Frederick, bordering on hatred, bound Hervey and Queen Caroline. The third and most famous quarrel involved Alexander Pope and turned both on politics, Pope being a tory and Hervey a whig, and on sex, Pope having been a disappointed admirer of both Mary Lepell and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. It suffices for the present to say that by incurring the enmity of Pope, Hervey became one of literature's most celebrated satiric targets.<br>
<br>Late in 1737 Queen Caroline died. Hervey attended her during much of her brief but difficult ordeal. Shaken by the loss of his close friend, he ended the memoirs he had been drafting for a decade. He also reminded Walpole that the passing of the queen removed the chief obstacle that had stood between him and higher office. Walpole was not unappreciative of Hervey's claim upon his good offices, but he had to contend with a second obstacle&#151;the hostility of the duke of Newcastle to any promotion for Hervey&#151;and so elevation was again deferred. Hervey was thus obliged to pay the price for too openly mocking the public awkwardnesses of the aristocratic minister. Despite the disappointment, he remained faithful to the ministry, effectively defending its Spanish policies both when the convention of Pardo was drafted and then when war could no longer be resisted; he also loyally denounced opposition efforts to require MPs to declare publicly whether they received government pensions. Walpole finally determined to face down Newcastle, and on 1 May 1740, on the resignation of Lord Godolphin, Hervey became lord privy seal.<br>
<br>In his new office Hervey was entitled to attend the meetings of the cabinet council and, when the king was in Hanover, of the lords justices, but his presence was irregular. As Walpole's policy towards Spain became increasingly controversial, however, Hervey resumed his role as an unembarrassed and indomitable advocate of the ministry in the House of Lords. In return for this loyalty Walpole authorized the elevation of Stephen Fox to the rank of Lord Ilchester. But, as parliamentary opposition to the government's foreign policy mounted, Walpole's hold on power began to slip, and early in 1742 Sir Robert resigned his office. Hervey tried to retain the privy seal, but the new ministry had little trust in the sedulous defender of the fallen Walpole, and on 12 July 1742 Hervey yielded the privy seal, simultaneously declining, as a mark of his indifference to favour, the royal offer of a substantial pension. With this dismissal from the office he had so long sought, Hervey was out of the government for the first time in thirteen years.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcommentator"></a>Political commentator</h2>Politics was an abiding interest of Lord Hervey's; his comments upon it recur throughout his letters, his political tracts, and the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of King George II</span>. Although he claimed that Tacitus and Machiavelli were his instructors about political matters, he was suspicious of the utility of political theory, and his views, while often entertainingly expressed, rarely rose above the commonplace. He defined the task of government to be the sustaining of a suitable balance between civil order and personal liberty, and he approved of Walpole's court whig administration precisely because it realized that goal. He saw potential enemies of liberty lurking in all quarters&#151;in an unbounded crown, in an unrestrained church, in an unregulated army, in an unchecked mob. The responsibility of governors was to find the means to confine the tendency of king, prelate, soldier, and zealot to sacrifice liberty to their own cause or need. Walpole was successful because he read human nature aright, and by recognizing that people &#145;feel sensibly for nothing but what is conducive some way or other to their pleasure, or their interest, or their pride&#146;  (Fox-Strangways, 132), he usually contrived to create the combination of sweeteners and threats necessary to effect the confinement.<br>
<br>As a public polemicist Hervey was bold and direct, and his three greatest tracts, while striking different tones, are alike in moving quickly to an aggressive assertion of their claims. In <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Liberty Stated and Compared</span> (1734) he popularized the standard court whig argument that England had not been free until liberated by the revolution of 1688 and that the court whigs, as the true heirs of the revolutionary whigs, were the only qualified defenders of its legacy. In <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Opposition and the Tendency of Modern Patriotism</span> (1734) he mocked Walpole's opponents for their blindness to the dangers of allowing an army to be insubordinate to the monarch. In <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Thoughts</span> (1742) he defended the recently dissolved Walpole administration against charges of corruption, incompetence, and selfishness. These are not subtle works, but they were widely deemed effective. Indeed, Horace Walpole called some of Hervey's polemical efforts &#145;equal to any that ever were written&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Some Materials</span>, 1.xxxiv).<br>
<br>Hervey's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, which describe various happenings at the court of George II from 1727 to 1737 (with a gap for 1730&#150;32), are an entirely different kind of work. Though they were probably intended for a general audience, Hervey did not publish them in his lifetime, and they then languished unseen (though not unknown) for a century until the first marquess of Bristol, after suppressing some sections that spoke slightingly of the royal family, authorized their appearance in 1848. A fuller version, based on documents in the Windsor archives and including some of the earlier excisions, appeared in 1931. Even in this later edition, however, a hole remains, leading to the hypothesis that at some point someone who controlled the manuscript&#151;the same Lord Bristol looms large as a candidate&#151;destroyed some of its pages. The motive for the destruction is uncertain, though suspicion attaches itself to a concern that excessive candour about the character of Hervey's close relationship with Prince Frederick would damage the author's or the prince's posthumous reputation.<br>
<br>For historians of the eighteenth century the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> are an indispensable work. &#145;I am determined to report everything just as it is&#146;, Hervey declared, &#145;or at least just as it appears to me&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Some Materials</span>, 2.347). Despite his resort to the third person in discussing himself as a player in the drama of court life, Hervey's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> are in fact very personal, direct, and even earthy. They provide ironic and amusing character sketches of the men and women who exercised power in the 1730s and memorable accounts of such events as the marriage of Princess Anne to the prince of Orange, Frederick's virtual abduction of his wife as she went into labour, and&#151;their great set piece&#151;the hideous death of Queen Caroline. They also allow the historian to understand some of the methods Walpole employed to exercise power and especially how, in collusion with Queen Caroline, he managed George II. They tell the tale of friendships shattered, policies undone, and ambitions thwarted. Because Hervey is a good story-teller, with an eye for the useful detail and an ear for good conversation, the stories are human and gripping. Hervey's is a personal view of politics, and, if his limning of Walpole pulls forward the manipulative aspect of the prime minister's character, he still wants his readers to understand that by and large Sir Robert used his immense talent at political management for essentially useful ends.<h2>
<a name="HerveyandPope"></a>Hervey and Pope</h2>In 1735 Alexander Pope published his <span class="italic">Epistle to Arbuthnot</span>, which contained, in its section on Lord Hervey, one of literature's most celebrated examples of venomous invective. Hervey was cast as Sporus, the castrated boy whom Nero had transformed into his wife. Pope excoriated Hervey's politics, his sexual ambivalence, and his morality. Each of his words drew blood. Hervey was a &#145;mere white curd of ass's milk&#146;, a &#145;bug with gilded wings&#146;, a &#145;painted child of dirt that stinks and stings&#146;, &#145;one vile antithesis&#146;, an &#145;amphibious thing&#146;, a:<blockquote>
<div>Fop at the toilet, flatterer at the board,<br>
</div>
<div>[who] now trips a lady, and now struts a lord<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He bore &#145;a cherub's face&#151;a reptile all the rest&#146;, an almost fitting body for a &#145;familiar toad&#146;. He spoke only &#145;in florid impotence&#146;, for his &#145;buzz the witty and the fair annoys&#146;. Two couplets in particular captured Pope's vision of his subject. The first was his grand gesture of dismissal:<blockquote>
<div>Satire or sense, alas! Can Sporus feel?<br>
</div>
<div>Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The second was a summary of his contempt:<blockquote>
<div>Beauty that shocks you, parts that none can trust,<br>
</div>
<div>Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>It was Hervey's fault that the assault occurred. Although Pope and he had long since abandoned whatever friendship they may once have had when both sought the favour of Mary Lepell, the poet had in general over the years ignored the courtier in his lacerating works. The torrent of invective that cascaded into public attention in 1735 had been invited two years earlier when Hervey, in support of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, an earlier target of Pope's verbal sword, had associated himself with the cruel allusions to Pope's physical deformity in <span class="italic">Verses addressed to the Imitator of Horace</span>. Among its lines are these, representative both of the work's tone and of the authors' capacity:<blockquote>
<div>Like the first bold assassin be thy lot,<br>
</div>
<div>Ne'er be thy guilt forgiven nor forgot<br>
</div>
<div>But as thou Hat'st, be hated by mankind,<br>
</div>
<div>And, with the emblem of thy crooked mind<br>
</div>
<div>Mark'd on thy back, like Cain by God's own hand,<br>
</div>
<div>Wander, like him, accursed through the land.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>After the <span class="italic">Epistle to Arbuthnot</span> appeared, Hervey acknowledged his poetic and satiric inadequacy and withdrew from all efforts to match Pope in the art of verbal warfare. Pope, however, continued to take pleasure in savaging Hervey, even after Hervey's death, and Henry Fielding resumed many of the same themes of political, sexual, and moral depravity in his Hervey-based depiction of Beau Didapper in <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (1742). In many ways it is fair to say that through his withering barrages Pope created the persona of Lord Hervey that has endured ever since.<h2>
<a name="Herveyspersonallife"></a>Hervey's personal life</h2>In appearance Hervey was slender, a bit below average height for his era, and youthfully handsome even into his forties. The poor health that had dogged him in his childhood returned intermittently throughout his life. Though an exact diagnosis of his malady is impossible at a distance of 250 years, he appears to have been subject to epileptic seizures and to the acute pain of gallstones. The diet that he adopted in an effort to mend his body&#151;milk, tea, many vegetables, no meat&#151;was so famously bland that it became one of the peculiar habits his critics mocked. Perhaps it was some ailment and a disfiguring appearance that may have followed from it that account for another of the eccentricities for which he was famous, a fondness for applying powder to his face. (It is known by way of additional explanation for this habit that one of the facial blemishes he so disliked was a legacy of surgery he had endured while in Italy.) By the age of forty he had lost all his teeth.<br>
<br>Although not a scholar, Hervey was learned in the manner of an educated eighteenth-century gentleman, proud of his command of Latin and at ease in French. His acquaintance with, in his youth, Dr Robert Freind, headmaster of Westminster School, and, in his later years, with the noted classicist Conyers Middleton, assured that he remained in contact with scholarly circles throughout his life. He even assisted Middleton in the preparation of the scholar's <span class="italic">Life of Cicero</span>, for which help Middleton lavished praise on Hervey in the dedication.<br>
<br>The friendship that has left the fullest evidentiary basis&#151;in the form of a published correspondence&#151;is Hervey's tie with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. From the days of Hervey's visit to Hanover in 1716 (and perhaps earlier) to the last months of his life in 1743 he found in Lady Mary a person in whom he could comfortably confide. They liked and disliked the same people, they took pride and pleasure in versifying, they enjoyed gossip, and they shared a somewhat ironic view of life. Above all, they accepted each other for the flawed but interesting human beings that they respectively were, Lady Mary as a woman who at times wanted to be a man and Lord Hervey as the opposite. In his last letter to her (and almost the last surviving letter he wrote), dated 18 June 1743, a declining Hervey betrayed his fondness when he wrote that &#145;the last stages of an infirm life are filthy roads &hellip; May all your ways (as <span class="roman">Solomon</span> says of wisdom) be ways of pleasantness and all your paths peace &hellip; Adieu&#146;  (Halsband, 304).<br>
<br>Hervey and his father remained close throughout the son's life, even though, as a country whig, Lord Bristol disapproved of Hervey's court whig politics. With his mother, however, Hervey enjoyed a less happy and ultimately poisonous relationship, in part because Lady Bristol did not like Mary Lepell, in part because she supported Frederick, prince of Wales. At one point he called her &#145;the vehicle of all the ills I ever complained of&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Some Materials</span>, 3.962). Hervey's relations with his wife are more difficult to assess. She was loyal, and they often appeared to enjoy each other's company; they had eight children, whom he doted upon; but she was also very visibly his intellectual inferior, and he was frequently away from her&#151;perhaps because she did not care for London, but perhaps too because he had other romantic interests. His callous treatment of her in his will shows that at the end they were severely estranged.<br>
<br>Lord Hervey was bisexual. It is necessary to state this point directly because changing senses of propriety over the years, combined with the bite of Pope's caricature, have obscured a proper understanding of the nature of his sexual orientation. There can be no doubt that he found women attractive. In addition to his marriage to Mary Lepell, he wooed and bedded Anne Vane and claimed (along with others) to be the father of the child she bore in 1733. He may have had an affair with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and perhaps one with Princess Caroline. But there can also be no doubt that he found men attractive. He followed Stephen Fox to Italy in 1728 and frequently lived with him over the next decade. He wrote passionate love letters to Francesco Algarotti, the multi-talented Italian intellectual whom he first met in 1736 and for whose affections his chief English rival was, of all people, Lady Mary. He may have had a sexual affair with Prince Frederick before their friendship dissolved.<br>
<br>While the laws of the eighteenth century prescribed harsh penalties for men who engaged in homosexual activities, high society generally preferred being amused to being outraged when the miscreant was one of their own. Hervey, moreover, was happy to play the role of amuser, sometimes striking feminine attitudes and happily conjoining them with feminine behaviours. He was undisguisedly, even proudly, androgynous. He thus was the frequent target of salacious humour. William Pulteney called him &#145;Mr <i>Fainlove</i> &hellip; such a nice Composition of the two Sexes, that it is difficult to distinguish which is more praedominant&#146;  (Norton, 149), while an anonymous tract styled him the &#145;Lady of the Lords&#146;  (ibid., 152). And, leaving Pope's contributions aside, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu delivered the most celebrated of the contemporary judgements when she wrote that humankind was divided into three sexes: men, women, and Herveys  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Some Materials</span>, 1.xiv).<h2>
<a name="Herveysdeath"></a>Hervey's death</h2>Hervey's dismissal from government in 1742 preceded his death by only a year. He spent some of that time defending the work of the administration he had served and some of it trying to mobilize his friends and family to resist the actions of the new ministry. This latter activity cost him his friendship with Stephen Fox, who preferred place to loyalty. Hervey took ill in the spring of 1743, withdrew to Ickworth in hopes of recuperating, and died there on 5 August. He was buried at Ickworth on 12 August; Conyers Middleton later contributed the Latin epitaph for his monument. The precise nature of the disease that took his life is not known, but because he had suffered bouts of poor health since childhood, his demise was not entirely a surprise, even though he was only forty-six years of age.<br>
<br>Hervey drew up a will in the last month of his life. Although conventional with respect to his children, with his eldest son being designated sole heir and the other children receiving annuities, it was astonishingly savage in its treatment of Lady Hervey. She received only the minimum required by their marriage contract&#151;a jointure of &pound;300 per year&#151;and was further humiliated by stipulations suggesting that she might, if given freedom to dispose of property, seek to deprive their children of an inheritance. The grounds for such pettiness provoked much speculation in the succeeding months, and no generally accepted explanation for Hervey's vindictive treatment of his wife has appeared. Perhaps&#151;there is evidence of a measure of disorientation in his final year&#151;he succumbed to loss of wit before loss of life. The size of his estate is unknown, but since it was not divided upon his death and since his heirs prospered, observers concluded that it had been unencumbered.<br>
