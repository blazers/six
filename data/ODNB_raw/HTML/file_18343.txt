<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Matthew, Sir  Toby <span class="st"> [Tobie]</span></span>  (1577&#150;1655), <span class="occ">writer and courtier</span>, was born at Salisbury on 3 October 1577, the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18342/', "Tobie Matthew (1544?&#150;1628)")</script>, later archbishop of York, and Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1629) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72735/', "Matthew, Frances")</script>], widow of Matthew Parker, son of the former archbishop of Canterbury. On 13 March 1590 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where his father was dean; he graduated BA on 5 June 1594 and proceeded MA on 5 July 1597. He was selected to act in 1595 in a &#145;device&#146; presented in the queen's presence for which Francis Bacon wrote the dialogue, which was the beginning of their lifelong friendship  (Sutherland, 36). In 1598 he went to France to visit one of the Throckmortons of Coughton, but after returning was seriously ill. He showed an interest in politics after being admitted to Gray's Inn on 15 May 1599, and was returned as MP for the Cornish borough of Newport iuxta Launceston in the last Elizabethan parliament in 1601. He fell ill again &#145;with a long shrewd fit of his old infirmitie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.144) in May 1602 but later, with Bacon's help, he was returned as MP for St Albans for the first session of parliament in 1604. Before it adjourned his political interest waned for, on 3 July 1604, he secured a licence to travel for three years.<h2>
<a name="Conversion"></a>Conversion</h2>In April 1605 Matthew went to The Hague to visit his friend Dudley Carleton and then to Italy, contrary to the wishes of his parents. In Florence he associated with resident English Catholics and then proceeded to Rome, where he often met the superior of the English Jesuits, Robert Persons, as well as Cardinal Pinelli. After he returned to Paris in January 1607 a spy informed William Trumbull: &#145;Mr. Mathew is neither fish nor flesh. He discourseth with priests and hath been at the mass, but of late also at my lord ambassador's sermons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 2.223). Matthew returned to Florence to attend the Lenten services and, as he wrote later: &#145;purposed fully to become a Roman Catholic&#146;  (Matthew, &#145;True historicall relation&#146;, 156). In late March at the church of the Annunciata a Jesuit preacher, Lelio Ptolemei, performed the traditional rites.<br>
<br>Upon his arrival in England, by September 1607, Matthew's conversion created a stir in the established church. There were planned serious polemical debates with Launcelot Andrews, bishop of Chichester, Alberico Gentili, professor of civil law at Oxford, Sir Christopher Perkins, and Thomas Morton, bishop of Chester. A tenacious adversary was George Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, who after many conferences sent him to the Fleet prison when he refused the oath of allegiance. In February 1608 Matthew was brought before the privy council, where the earl of Salisbury informed him that he was granted six weeks &#145;to set his affaires in order and depart the realme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.255).<h2>
<a name="Anodysseyofnineyears"></a>An odyssey of nine years</h2>In May 1608 Matthew settled down in Florence, where he regaled Dudley Carleton with news that he was in &#145;an excellent coole terrene&#146; and able to &#145;eate good melons, drinke wholesome wines, looke upon excellent devout pictures [and] heer choyse musique&#146;  (Stoye, 79). However, a hostile visitor, Henry Wotton, ambassador to Venice, disdained him as a leader of &#145;a certain knot of bastard Catholiques &hellip; who with pleasantness of conversation and force of example do much harm&#146; in their hospitality to English visitors  (ibid., 76&#150;7). In 1609 Matthew arrived in Madrid, where he joined the entourage of Sir Robert Shirley, who was commissioned by the shah of Persia to negotiate with Philip III a military alliance against the Turkish empire. Since the Spanish court was not ready to do this Shirley left for England but Matthew remained to visit famous sites and read the works of Spanish theologians. Meanwhile, between 1608 and 1614 he was engaged in a major poetical endeavour in which he composed a series of twenty-nine sonnets of high quality, of which eighteen reflected his private devotion to the saints and eleven others some very personal experiences. Apparently he dedicated these poems to George Gage (<i>c</i>.1582&#150;1638), his close companion of these years.<br>
<br>Early in 1611 Matthew returned to Paris, where an informant wrote to Trumbull that he &#145;appeared stronger in his perversion and professing popery than ever&#146;, but in such poor health that &#145;at first we could scarce know him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 3.12). In 1612 Gage and Matthew began a two-year tour of Italy, after arriving in Venice by way of Basel and Milan, so that they did not reach Rome until a long itinerary was completed. Here on 20 May 1614 Cardinal Bellarmine ordained Matthew to the priesthood. Later they visited Leipzig, where in March 1615 Matthew confided to the second earl of Arundel that he was there &#145;to satisfy my curiosity about these northern parts&#146; and had concluded &#145;they are to be held little less than barbarous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 5.154). Afterwards they purchased paintings in Flanders on behalf of Dudley Carleton. By this time the burden of travel and poor health forced Matthew to seek help from friends so as to return to England, although there were unfriendly voices at court such as Archbishop Abbot's, who advised Trumbull: &#145;I have little to say in favour of &hellip; Toby Matthew&#146; and gave a long list of grievances  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 5.532). Finally, after his parents appealed to Buckingham to influence King James, he was allowed to return to England in May 1617.<h2>
<a name="Firsttranslations"></a>First translations</h2>Once again Matthew made an extended visit to Bacon at Gorhambury and as a token of gratitude he translated into Italian a collection of thirty-eight essays by the lord chancellor. In London his first book was printed in 1618 entitled <span class="italic">Saggi morali &hellip; con un altro trato della sapienza</span>, with a dedication to Cosimo (II) de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, wherein Matthew praised the high quality of Bacon's learning. More startling to the court was the news that Matthew had guided the conversion of Frances Brydges, second wife of the earl of Exeter, as Chamberlain lamented: &#145;I heard yt now two several wayes that he hath perverted her to become a Romane Catholique&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.128). Possibly this incident led King James to insist that Matthew take the oath of allegiance which, after his refusal, once again meant exile.<br>
<br>This, however, proved to be a productive period of writing, since between early 1619 and late 1621 Matthew published six books at St Omer: four translations of well-known Italian and Spanish writers; a fifth was his well-received version of Augustine's <span class="italic">Confessions</span>; and a sixth was his original essay in English on the value of private devotions entitled <span class="italic">The Widdowes Mite</span>. Published in 1619 this last work included his new poem of 32 pages named &#145;A Prayer for the Love of God&#146;. The <span class="italic">Confessions</span>, which appeared in 1620, was the first English translation of Augustine's thirteen books in a text of 800 pages with a long preface and annotations added to help the reader. However, while his prose was elegant Matthew's accuracy was questioned at times, since he had to rely on a flawed Latin text. For his translations from the Italian he chose two unusual biographies: in 1619 he published the text, first translated by &#145;a dying Freind&#146; of Vicenzo Puccini's <span class="italic">Suor Maria Magdalena de Patsi</span>, to which he added marginal notes and a preface (<span class="italic">The Life of the Holy and Venerable Mother</span>, sig. *3<i>r</i>); and then in 1620 he brought out a version of Giuseppe Biondi's narrative of the repentance of a former bandit called <span class="italic">A Relation of the Death of &hellip; Troilo Savelli</span>. He commented in the preface that this latter story had already been translated into other languages, &#145;though not at all into ours, nor yet as carefully into others &hellip; as I could have wished&#146;  (sig. A1<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). He also chose two leading Spanish writers. In 1620 appeared the <span class="italic">Audi filia: a Rich Cabinet of Spiritual Jewels</span> by Juan de Avila, a famous preacher of the Counter-Reformation in Andalusia, who completed this popular tract in 1557. In 1621 Matthew published twenty chapters from the <span class="italic">Imitaci&oacute;n de Cristo</span> by Francisco Arias, a Jesuit professor of theology in C&oacute;rdoba, entitled <span class="italic">The Judge &hellip; how Christ &hellip; is to Judge the World</span>. Meanwhile, when Matthew learned that Bacon had suffered his political downfall Matthew wrote such an eloquent letter to him that Bacon commented that it seemed &#145;as if it had been in old gold&#146; and it may have been a source for his essay <span class="italic">De amicitia</span>  (<span class="italic">Letters and Life of Francis Bacon</span>, 7.344&#150;5).<h2>
<a name="ThecourtsatViennaandMadrid"></a>The courts at Vienna and Madrid</h2>Although Matthew never received a diplomatic post officially he was asked twice to assist in major negotiations. In 1621 Lord John Digby asked him to be his principal agent and assistant in Vienna when he was ambassador-extraordinary to the court of Ferdinand II to discuss the palatinate crisis. Pleased with Matthew's skill in languages and political advice Digby later pleaded successfully on his behalf with King James and he was allowed to return to England by December. Back in London, Matthew completed <span class="italic">Of the Love of our Only Lord</span>, a new treatise, which was printed at St Omer in 1622 and contained ninety-six short chapters of his reflections. Of far greater satisfaction to him was the king's reception of him, which Chamberlain duly reported in September 1622. Apparently when Matthew went to visit his father he carried a message that the archbishop should &#145;now receve him to favour upon his reconciling to his Majestie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.452). Soon after this Matthew, sensing a danger to the Catholic community, revealed to the duke of Buckingham in a letter of 29 September 1622 that there was a plan by certain &#145;indiscreet English Catholiques&#146; to ask the pope to appoint five titular bishops for England that &#145;will much offend the kinge and many poore Catholiques &hellip; will yet smart for it in the end&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 1581, fol. 82). After his disclosure the plan did not proceed further.<br>
<br>Matthew's second unofficial diplomatic mission began in spring 1623 when the king asked him to assist Prince Charles and Buckingham in Madrid in the treaty to be negotiated for the marriage to the infanta. As a skilled linguist and friend of Gondomar and Digby, Matthew performed many services but an unusual one was his appeal in a letter to young Philip IV that protested the rigorous terms imposed on the prince by the &#145;theologi&#146;. He warned that they would break up the treaty and leave the English Catholics &#145;in a lamentable state&#146; unless their terms were reduced. He advised Philip &#145;to give the Prince some foot of ground &hellip; as whereupon he may with honour stay and perfect the treaty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabala</span>, 303). Upon Matthew's return to England, King James conferred a knighthood upon him at Royston on 20 October 1623, which was an extraordinary gesture to a Catholic priest. Matthew later wrote, in 1640, that &#145;a visible marke of particular honour&#146; had been given to him by James, &#145;at the instance of his Majestie that now is&#146; which implied that this was a reward for unusual services in Madrid  (Matthew, &#145;True historicall relation&#146;, 158).<br>
<br>Matthew's father, having been dismayed at his conversion, now arranged a meeting of Sir Toby with several clergymen who sought to alter his views. Matthew, however, remained unmoved and wrote later: &#145;It was strange to see how they wrung their hands and their whites of eyes were turned up and their devout sighes were sent abroad&#146;  (Matthew, &#145;True historicall relation&#146;, 158). In November 1623 he had the role of chief mourner, &#145;clad in black cotton or bayes down to the heeles&#146; in the obsequies at the Spanish embassy for the Catholics killed accidentally while attending mass at Blackfriars  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.525).<br>
<br>Early in the reign of Charles I, Matthew produced a new series of translations. He began with thirty-four chapters from <span class="italic">The Practice of Perfection and Christian Virtues</span> (1609) by the well-known Castilian Jesuit, Alfonso Rodr&iacute;guez (<i>d</i>. 1616), which appeared as <span class="italic">A Treatise of Mentall Prayer</span> in 1627. Later at St Omer he published in 1630 his second English tract anonymously entitled: <span class="italic">Charity Mistaken, with the Want Thereof Catholikes are Unjustly Charged</span>, which has been mistakenly attributed to Matthew Wilson. There followed in the same year translations of two different sections of the <span class="italic">Imitaci&oacute;n de Cristo</span> of Francisco Arias: <span class="italic">A Treatise of Patience</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise of Benignity</span>. Finally, in 1632 he published two other translations from Alfonso Rodr&iacute;guez: <span class="italic">The Two First Treatises of &hellip; Christian Perfection</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise of Humilitie</span>, that had forty chapters.<h2>
<a name="Thecourtier"></a>The courtier</h2>After 1630 Matthew appeared more frequently at the court, as can be seen in his letters to Henry Vane the elder, ambassador to The Hague, where details abound of royal favourites and of his own visits to the residences of notables. He especially admired the countess of Carlisle: &#145;the highest creature Sir Tobie has known in all kinds of excellency&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1631&#150;3</i>, 437). In June 1634 the marquis de Fontenay-Mareuil, an ambassador who had observed Matthew for three years, considered him &#145;the cleverest of the Catholic seminarists [secular clergy], a man of parts, active, influential, an excellent linguist&#146;, who was able to &#145;penetrate cabinets&#146; and &#145;insinuate himself into all kinds of affairs and knows the temper and purpose of those who govern the kingdom, especially of the lord treasurer [Richard Weston]&#146;. However, his sole ambition was &#145;the relief and benefit of the Catholics&#146;  (von Ranke, 5.448).<br>
<br>The marquis was correct in noting that Matthew had won the confidence of several influential courtiers. He accompanied Wentworth to Ireland for a brief period in 1633 and was a welcome visitor to Lord Cottington, Sir Francis Windebank, and Sir John Winter, secretary to Henrietta Maria. He was also regularly seen in the company of Endymion Porter, Kenelm Digby, and Walter Montague, who were prominent in Henrietta's court at Somerset House. However, many others resented Matthew's presence as the Newport affair in November 1637 proved. The conversion of Anne Boteler, wife of Mountjoy Blount, earl of Newport, enraged her husband, who publicly denounced Matthew and Walter Montague to King Charles for covertly influencing her. The anger of the king against the two men was so intense, although neither had been in fact involved, that Secretary Conway remarked: &#145;don Tobiah was in such perplexitie that I find he will make a very ill man to be a martyr&#146;  (Albion, 213 n. 2). It was later established that Anne Boteler had been influenced by her Catholic sister, her aunt, the duchess of Buckingham, and George Con, the papal representative to Henrietta.<br>
<br>During the first bishops' war in 1639 a political squib circulated that identified Matthew as an &#145;abettor&#146; of a popish plot at the court, who encouraged Winter and Queen Marie de' Medici to make a &#145;laughing stock&#146; of England  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 246). Later, another squib claimed that Winter and Matthew were &#145;court papists&#146; who were informants of Rome  (Hibbard, 126). In September 1640 a spy named Habernfeld disclosed to William Boswell, ambassador at The Hague, fanciful details of a &#145;Jesuitical&#146; plot to murder King Charles and Archbishop Laud, wherein Toby Matthew had a leading role, since he was &#145;a most vigilant man of the chief heads &hellip; never quiet, always in action and perpetual motion&#146;  (ibid., 158&#150;9). This sensational fiction led some radicals in the Long Parliament to denounce Matthew and others as treasonous &#145;court papists&#146; who endangered the kingdom  (ibid., 190&#150;92). By 17 March 1641 both houses had voted that Matthew and two others must be banned from the precincts of the court at once. With imprisonment also likely Matthew sought protection at Raglan Castle with the earl of Worcester, but left England for the last time in April 1641.<h2>
<a name="LastyearsinGhent"></a>Last years in Ghent</h2>Escaping the turmoil of the civil war Matthew found safety in the English Jesuit college at Ghent, where he started to write again. In 1642 there appeared <span class="italic">The Flaming Hart: the Life of the Glorious S. Teresa</span>, a translation of Teresa of Avila's autobiography. His preface noted that although it was translated earlier, that author &#145;seemed to have lost a little of the puritie of his owne Englishe tongue&#146; but &#145;not to have acquired enough of the Spanish&#146;, and so a new text was called for  (Allison and Rogers, 2.154). In 1647 his last book appeared in Louvain entitled <span class="italic">A Missive of Consolation &hellip; to the Catholics of England</span>. In eleven chapters he offered personal reflections from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and philosophy on the virtue of patience which Catholics needed during their current trials. In the same year he made his last will in which he gave a major part of his personal estate to the English Jesuits and entrusted his manuscripts to Walter Montague. After a grave illness he died unmarried on 13 October 1655 at the English Jesuit college in Ghent and was buried in its chapel's crypt with his coffin inscribed: &#145;Hic jacet D. Tobias Matthaei&#146;.<br>
<br>Matthew left unpublished two completed books. On 8 September 1640 he had finished a 234-page manuscript entitled: &#145;A true historicall relation of the conversion of Sir Tobie Matthew&#146;, which remained in private hands until lost in the nineteenth century. Before its disappearance W. C. Neligan selected excerpts at random for a limited private edition that has been used in later printings. In 1651 Matthew had made ready for publication &#145;The life of Lady Lucy Knatchbull&#146;, who died in 1629 after an exemplary career as abbess of the Benedictine convent in Ghent. This text survived unpublished until 1931 when it was edited by David Knowles.<br>
<br>Toby Matthew's career at the early Stuart court was notable for its striking reverses. Under James I he was exiled twice (1608&#150;17 and 1619&#150;22) but in 1623 was reconciled and knighted. Under Charles I he gained many influential friends but in 1641 suffered demonization as a court papist in parliament and fled to Flanders. His achievement as a writer, despite exile and illness, was significant indeed. His superior linguistic skills enabled him to prepare polished English versions of not only classic autobiographies by Augustine and Teresa, but also translations of two unusual biographies by Italian authors and nine recent treatises on spirituality by leading Spanish contemporaries. He also produced four personal essays of pastoral advice for his beleaguered fellow Catholics in Britain.<br>
