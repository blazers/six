<span class="headword">Bartlett, Sir  Charles John</span>  (1889&#150;1955), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 December 1889 at Bibury, Gloucestershire, the son of George Bartlett, a miller journeyman, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevens. After attending the village school in Bibury he completed his formal education at Bath Technical College, studying business methods and specializing in accounting.<br>
<br>Having enlisted in the Devonshire and Dorsetshire regiment in 1914, Bartlett was severely wounded at the battle of Loos, and after recovery saw further service in France and the Middle East. He was demobilized in 1919 with the rank of sergeant and in the following year joined General Motors Ltd (the American car manufacturer) as an accounting clerk at its London branch in Hendon. His leadership qualities were soon recognized, and by rapid promotion he reached the post of managing director in 1926.<br>
<br>General Motors (GM) was anxious to acquire a British manufacturing base to circumvent import tariffs on foreign vehicles, and in 1926 the board recommended the purchase of the ailing Vauxhall Motor Company in Luton. Bartlett was considered an ideal person to oversee Vauxhall and transform it into a mass producer of vehicles. A story current at the time was that when J. D. Mooney, the director of General Motors' overseas operations, was told by Alfred P. Sloan, president and chairman of GM, to pick an Englishman to run Vauxhall, he replied: &#145;Well I guess it had better be Charlie Bartlett; he's about as English as they come&#146;  (Platt, 93).<br>
<br>Under Bartlett's control the first car to be produced in the recapitalized and reorganized Luton plant was the Vauxhall Cadet, which was followed by the much more popular Light Six in 1933, and later by the outstandingly successful Vauxhall Ten in 1937. The greatest success, however, was in the light truck market; 11,200 trucks were produced in 1931, and the figure rose to a commercial vehicle output of 60,800 Bedfords in 1954. According to Sir Reginald Pearson it was Bartlett who convinced Sloan that trucks would be very profitable for Vauxhall, and by the end of the 1930s Vauxhall was one of the &#145;Big Six&#146; vehicle producers in Britain. CJB, as he was known, was summed up by a former colleague thus:<blockquote>He never lost his simple and sturdily democratic approach to industrial management. This robust attitude went well with a determined character, a strong stocky physique and a sense of humour leavened what could otherwise have been too paternal an outlook towards the Vauxhall workforce. (Platt, 93)</blockquote>A number of policies were introduced under Bartlett's management to ensure good industrial relations and the loyalty of the workforce. Rates of pay were relatively high, a profit sharing scheme was introduced in 1935, he provided greater job security so that workers were not automatically laid off <i>en masse</i> when orders were low, and in 1941 he introduced a form of works council. He pursued an active policy of promoting shop floor workers to managerial positions, among the most notable being Sir Reginald Pearson. He also encouraged the development of welfare and leisure programmes. During the Bartlett era there were no serious industrial disputes at Vauxhall. Unionists in other car firms referred to it as &#145;the turnip patch&#146; in recognition of its apparent rural tranquillity in industrial relations.<br>
<br>Despite his obvious success at managing Vauxhall, which included a huge reorganization to mass produce Churchill tanks and Bedford army trucks during the Second World War (for which he was knighted in 1944), Bartlett did not always see eye to eye with the top management of GM. These differences became more severe in the post-war years, particularly over future plans for the company. In April 1953 Bartlett was replaced by Walter Hill, a GM man, and he was offered the post of chairman without executive responsibility until his retirement in 1954.<br>
<br>Bartlett married Emily May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pincombe, on 24 October 1925. He was active in many associations, serving as president of the Luton chamber of commerce (1938&#150;45), deputy lieutenant of Bedfordshire (1952), vice-president (1946&#150;53) and president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, and council member for the British Institute of Management. He retained a lifelong love of horticulture, was a keen cricketer and golfer, and had a passion for sport which led to the strong encouragement of recreational activities while managing director at Vauxhall. He died from heart failure at his home, Whitewalls, Kinsbourne Green, Harpenden, on 10 August 1955.<br>
