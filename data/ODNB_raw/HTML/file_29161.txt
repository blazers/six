<span class="headword">Whalley,  Richard</span>  (1498/9&#150;1583), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born into a well-established Nottinghamshire gentry family, the only son of Thomas Whalley (<i>d</i>. in or after 1549), landowner of Kirton, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Strelley of Woodborough. <h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>At an unknown date Whalley was sent to St John's College, Cambridge, essentially to round out an education hitherto based largely on martial exercise and etiquette. He did not take a degree, and subsequently completed his training in the household of Sir Thomas Lovell, probably thanks to his father, who had been an archer in Lovell's retinue in 1508. Richard Whalley was a gentleman of Lovell's household by 10 December 1522 and served until 25 May 1524. Thomas Cromwell employed a Richard Whalley to investigate Cardinal Wolsey's dissolved monasteries in 1527, but this was probably Richard Whalley (<i>d</i>. 1560) of Dalby in Yorkshire, who was attorney to the council of the north from 1536. <br>
<br>Before 1540 Richard Whalley of Kirton had married Laura, daughter of Thomas Brookman of Essex. They had five children, including Richard's heir, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1582). Whalley profited from his work for Cromwell. He advised his son Hugh, also one of Cromwell's servants, to buy former monastic land in Leicestershire in 1536 and himself began purchasing Nottinghamshire properties. These included the Newark and the Welbeck Abbey estates (the latter valued at &pound;249 6<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. p.a. when he bought it on 26 February 1539), as well as other lands, among them Hardwick, Osberton, and Worksop, in 1540. He petitioned John Gates unsuccessfully in 1542 to further his suit for other property near his estates worth &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. p.a. Cromwell was probably behind his appointment as JP for the North Riding in 1538. By 1540 Laura Whalley was dead and her husband had remarried, his second wife being a woman named Ursula; they had thirteen children. Whalley quickly found a patron after Cromwell's fall and was controller of the household of Thomas Manners, first earl of Rutland, from 1540 to 1541. An esquire by no later than May 1542, he also began accumulating profitable royal offices, including the receivership of the court of augmentations for Yorkshire from 1545. On 17 September that year he bought Worksop Priory, along with the advowson of the vicarage. He was named JP for Nottinghamshire in 1546, and was already one of the wealthiest gentlemen in the county when on 25 July he was granted the reversion of the college, wardenry, and chantry of St Mary of Sibthorpe. He took possession when its warden, Thomas Magnus, died on 28 August 1550. These acquisitions brought local responsibilities, including membership of important commissions in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. At court he was an esquire of the body by 1545. <h2>
<a name="ServicetoSomerset15471551"></a>Service to Somerset, 1547&#150;1551</h2>By 1 July 1547 Whalley had been appointed chamberlain of the household of his kinsman by marriage Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector. He received no salary, but instead enjoyed lucrative perquisites as one of the ducal council. Whalley was about the same age as Somerset, and like the lord protector he was a committed protestant. During Mary I's reign he entertained the prominent evangelical scholar William Ford at Welbeck Abbey, and he married sons to the daughters of a cousin and servant of Thomas Cranmer. Thomas Fisher, Somerset's secretary, noted that Whalley was a member of the duke's intimate circle by July 1548, though, unlike William Cecil and the principal secretary Sir Thomas Smith, he did not counsel Somerset about matters of state, his role being more practical but no less useful or valued. He was rewarded with more offices. In May 1547 Whalley was added to the quorum of the peace for the North Riding and was appointed JP for the East Riding. He was MP for Scarborough in 1547 and was probably returned to the final session of parliament in January 1552. Whalley disbursed royal money for Boulogne in summer 1549. In April 1549 Somerset procured Mortlake lodge and park for Cecil and wanted Wimbledon parsonage for Whalley. He had found both men invaluable supporters during the fall of his brother Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley and lord admiral. Initially, Cecil petitioned for Wimbledon but Somerset preferred to have him &#145;ney unto hyme&#146; at Mortlake because it was closer to his own houses at Syon and Sheen  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/36, M, fol. 82<i>r</i>). Whalley got Wimbledon instead. In August Cecil solicited Somerset's steward, Sir John Thynne, for an office on behalf of the receiver of the court of augmentations, John Aylworth. He worried that Whalley might, without the steward's assistance, &#145;ride before hym&#146;  (Longleat, Thynne MS 2, fol. 116<i>r</i>). Cecil believed that Whalley would succeed to one of Sir Anthony Denny's offices in the royal household but the October coup that toppled Somerset confounded any expectations that the chamberlain may have had. <br>
<br>Whalley was active on Somerset's behalf during the October coup. He helped organize his master's defence against the London council by conveying coffers to his own house at Wimbledon on 7 October 1549 and may have sheltered his kinswoman the duchess of Somerset there. That Whalley was sent by Somerset to protect the duchess and &#145;to recomfort her&#146; underlines his closeness to them  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/9/42, M, fol. 82<i>r</i>). Not all of Somerset's people proved so loyal. On 10 October Sir William Paget, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, agreed to betray his patron by apprehending Somerset and his leading supporters, including Whalley. The following day most of them were placed under house arrest by Sir Anthony Wingfield, vice-chamberlain and captain of the guard, at Windsor Castle, but Whalley appears to have been still at large, probably at Beddington with the duchess. Eventually he was apprehended and sent to the Tower of London but on 25 January 1550 was among the first to be released, on a bond of &pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. A few days later he was ordered to pay the wages of the ducal household. <br>
<br>In mid-1550 John Dudley, earl of Warwick, now the effective head of the government, began to forge ties with Cecil through Whalley. Relations within the Somerset household were strained during this time and John Raves, its clerk comptroller, complained that Whalley had embezzled &pound;60 owed to him. Having lost his dignity as lord protector, Somerset felt vulnerable and had difficulty adapting to a new, more circumscribed role. His wife was pushing him to be more assertive, while servants and clients like Whalley solicited practical support by turning to disgruntled members of the privy council and nobility. It was against this background that Whalley wrote to Cecil on 26 June 1550, recounting a discussion with Warwick in which Somerset's arrogant behaviour was criticized sharply. This constituted a blunt warning to members of the ducal household that they should moderate their own counsel towards Somerset because they &#145;fondlie perswadyde&#146; him to take dangerous courses. Whalley expressed his own loyalty to his patron, despite the difficulty of service in the present circumstances, and asked Cecil to be Somerset's good servant and good counsellor. Warwick acted as Whalley's &#145;veare [very] goode lorde&#146; and assisted him a few days later in the purchase of crown lands worth &pound;50 p.a., probably on favourable terms  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/10/9, M, fols. 21<i>v</i>&#150;22<i>r</i>). However, soliciting another patron was common and Whalley was still Somerset's man. Cecil too, remained close to the duke, despite becoming one of Warwick's intimates. <br>
<br>Somerset sent his servants and clients to several leading noblemen and gentlemen to gain their support during late 1550 and early 1551, probably in order to reduce his sense of isolation rather than to seek restoration to the protectorate. This role suited Whalley's intense personality, being &#145;a busy headed man anxious to be set on work&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.595). On 16 February 1551 he was interrogated &#145;for perswading divers nobles of the Realme to make the duke of Somerset protectour at the next parleament&#146;. He denied it but Henry Manners, second earl of Rutland, affirmed it &#145;manifestly&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Nero C.x, fol. 29<i>v</i>). Whalley was sent to the Fleet prison, and on 18 February the privy council questioned Sir Francis Leke, Rutland's uncle, about his activities. It transpired that Whalley had been sent to talk with Rutland at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, and the earl told Leke, &#145;he [Whalley] hathe been here with me and pratled very muche, whiche I like not&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1550&#150;52</i>, 217). Whalley was released on a bond of &pound;1000 on 2 April. <h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentandfinancialdifficulties15511559"></a>Imprisonment and financial difficulties, 1551&#150;1559</h2>On 18 October 1551 Whalley was re-arrested and sent to the Tower, where he was examined several times and pressured into testifying against Somerset at the duke's trial at Westminster Hall on 1 December. He received occasional visits from his wife, who had &#145;accesse to hym at any convenient tyme, though the sayd Lieutenaunt [Sir John Markham] be not present&#146;, and from his half-brother Walter  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1552&#150;4</i>, 31). He remained in prison until 19 June 1552, when he relinquished his position as receiver of the court of augmentations and gave bonds. Edward VI recorded that Whalley confessed:<blockquote>how he lent my money upon gaine and lucre &hellip; how he bought myne owne land with my money, how in his accoumptes he had made many false suggestions, how at the time of the fall of money he borowed divers swomes of money and had allowance for it after, by wich he gained 500 pound at one crieng downe, the hole summe being 2000<sup>li</sup> and above. (BL, Cotton MS Nero C.x, fol. 65<i>v</i>)</blockquote>As a result Whalley was re-arrested and sent to the Tower on 20 September, before being moved to the Marshalsea prison; although his imprisonment was &#145;ostensibly for peculation, it was probably a political sanction&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.595). He had not handled large amounts of money, and although his accounts were in arrears there is little evidence of peculation. Probably he speculated on the foreign exchanges using the king's money, but this was commonplace. Interestingly, the privy council protected his estates during his imprisonment. In prison he encouraged Richard Eden's experiments in transmutation, while his financial problems mounted, especially because of complications over manors that he had mortgaged to Sir Maurice Denys, who claimed &pound;3000 by default because Whalley overvalued them. <br>
<br>Released on 6 August 1553 and rehabilitated by Mary, Whalley was restored as JP for Nottinghamshire in 1554, returned as MP for East Grinstead, Sussex, in April 1554 and, perhaps through the patronage of Rutland, with whom he was again on friendly terms, as knight of the shire for Nottinghamshire in November 1554 and 1555. However, on 19 February 1556 the privy council denied his petition for restoration to the office of receiver, perhaps because of the earlier accusations. He did attempt to recover his losses. In 1553 or 1554 he brought an action in the exchequer alleging that his goods to the value of &pound;126 6<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. had been seized when he was &#145;wrongly imprisoned&#146; in the Tower &#145;through the cruelty and by the malicious commandment&#146; of Warwick  (Bryson, <span class="italic">Cases Concerning Equity</span>, 1.72). By 1559 debts amounting to about &pound;4800, mainly due to fines, forced him to consider selling Welbeck Abbey, and he took up residence at Screveton, Nottinghamshire. Although he sold other manors he was able to retain Welbeck, probably through astute land management (he was a leading figure in providing the government with timber from 1559). <h2>
<a name="Finalyears15591583"></a>Final years, 1559&#150;1583</h2>Whalley's position improved after the accession of Elizabeth I, perhaps due to his protestantism and his old association with Cecil. He was added to the quorum of the peace for Nottinghamshire in 1558&#150;9. On 14 July 1561 he was granted the Nottinghamshire manors of Whatton and Hawksworth and Towton in the West Riding, valued in total at &pound;139 7<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. p.a. Despite the political and financial vicissitudes of his long life, Whalley was able to provide for his many children in his will and left a third of his fortune to his third wife and executor, Barbara (<i>d</i>. in or after 1590), the mother of his last seven children. He died on 23 November 1583, aged eighty-four, and was buried in Screveton church. Within a year his widow had raised a fine alabaster tomb to his memory, Italianate in style, with his recumbent effigy in full plate armour, and an epitaph reminiscent of the words Somerset composed on the night before his execution. His head rests on a whale&#151;a rebus which also appeared on his coat-of-arms. He was succeeded by his grandson, Richard Whalley (<i>c</i>.1558&#150;<i>c</i>.1632), the father of the regicide Edward Whalley.<br>
