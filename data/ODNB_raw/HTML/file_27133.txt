<span class="headword">Tennant,  James</span>  (1808&#150;1881), <span class="occ">mineralogist and mineral and shell dealer</span>, was born on 8 February 1808 at Upton, near Southwell, Nottinghamshire, the third child of John Tennant, excise officer, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kitchen). By 1819 his parents had moved to Mansfield, and he was educated at schools both there and at Derby. In October 1824 he was apprenticed as shop assistant to John Mawe, mineral dealer, of 149 Strand, London. Mawe had been a great traveller and his shop was a resort for men of science from all over the world. Here Tennant gained his acquaintance with minerals. Mawe also sold turned ornamental marbles worked in Derbyshire, business which Tennant continued after Mawe's death.<br>
<br>Tennant attended lectures at his mechanics' institute and, later, those given by Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution. Faraday was a Mawe customer; he bought minerals there for use in his experiments. When Mawe died in 1829 his widow, Sarah, maintained the business, with Tennant now as resident manager. In 1838 Tennant was elected a fellow of the Geological Society, and was appointed to assist John Phillips (1800&#150;1874) as lecturer in geological mineralogy at King's College, London, on Faraday's recommendation. &#145;His class here [became] the largest in the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 12 March 1881).<br>
<br>Sarah Mawe had been created mineralogist to Queen Victoria on her accession. In February 1840 Tennant purchased the Mawe business and, on 15 October 1840, he inherited this title. The business lay only three doors from Somerset House, home of the Geological Society of London from 1828 to 1860, which helped to extend his circle of customers. By 1844 Tennant's shop was already &#145;too well known to require comment&#146;  (G. A. Mantell, <span class="italic">Medals of Creation</span>, 2.987).<br>
<br>From 1850 to 1867 Tennant was also lecturer on mineralogy and geology to the gentlemen cadets in the practical class of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1852&#150;3 he was paid &pound;2 a day to arrange and catalogue minerals in the British Museum. In 1853 he was made professor of geology at King's, but he resigned in 1869 on becoming keeper of the extensive collection of minerals of Angela, Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814&#150;1906). However, he retained his mineralogy lectureship at King's until his death. His pupil John Ruskin later said that Tennant's classes were &#145;the best practical teaching I know of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 26.451). In 1848 Tennant had purchased the 6000 specimens of the Stowe collection of minerals and fossils, made by the duke of Buckingham, for &pound;68 5<i>s</i>. He disposed of many of the best specimens before trying to sell the remainder. These were bought by Ruskin in 1867 for &pound;3000. But Ruskin considered he had been swindled and sued Tennant. After he had paid legal fees of &pound;1000, Ruskin received &pound;1000 back and further specimens to the value of &pound;500 in an out-of-court settlement.<br>
<br>Tennant's practical knowledge of minerals was extensive. By 1849 he possessed the finest collection of diamonds as crystals in England. He exhibited minerals and fossils for educational purposes at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1852 he encouraged emigrants to new countries to look for minerals other than gold, especially diamonds, and he superintended the recutting of the Koh-i-noor diamond and other crown jewels. When there was debate over the first diamonds found in South Africa in 1867, he correctly maintained their genuineness. By 1860 he was selling models of Waterhouse Hawkins's reconstructions of extinct animals, including dinosaurs. Collections to illustrate Lyell's <span class="italic">Elements of Geology</span> were offered by 1866.<br>
<br>Tennant was an early member of the Geologists' Association, helping with its first field excursions in 1860. He was elected its third president (1862&#150;4). He was an enthusiast for technical education, which he supported by giving liberally from his own resources. In 1869 he was elected freeman of the Turners' Company and, in May 1873, master. He persuaded the company to offer annual prizes for excellence in turning. Tennant's private collection of fossils was offered for sale in 1875. He died, unmarried, on 23 February 1881 at his home at 149 Strand, London. He was buried at Camberwell old cemetery, London, on 28 February. After his death an extensive selection from his private collection was purchased by the British Museum. His vast stocks were sold off in a series of auctions which lasted from 1881 to 1972. He was author of a number of educational works and also active as publisher, bookseller, and as a popular lecturer encouraging his favourite science.<br>
