</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">English, Sir  David</span>  (1930&#150;1998), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 26 May 1930 in Combe, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, the only child of Alfred Joseph English (1901&#150;1930), a bank clerk and innkeeper, and his wife, Kathleen Victoria (Kitty) Brazenor (1899&#150;1964). Alfred English died when his son was less than three months old. English's mother earned a living working as a secretary for the Post Office, then running a boarding-house in Broadstairs, and her parents helped bring up the small boy. The influence of English's grandfather upon him seems to have been profound. A devout Methodist, by his beliefs and actions he instilled in his grandson a regard for the values of family life. He had been a district manager of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and read three newspapers a day. His grandson therefore grew up in a household of acute political awareness, where the press was keenly read and discussed. While English was still a child his mother and her parents bought a hotel in Bournemouth, and this was where he spent his formative years, being educated at Bournemouth grammar school.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>As soon as English left school in 1946 he became a cub reporter on a local paper, the <span class="italic">Christchurch Times</span>. Fiercely ambitious, he was also thrilled by the romance of newspapers, and his own life story&#151;moving from the bottom rung of the trade to being a multi-millionaire newspaper executive on the back of success he had largely created for himself&#151;was the stuff of that romance. Although remarkably healthy throughout his life he managed to fail the medical for national service, so his career continued uninterrupted. In 1949 he moved to the <span class="italic">Portsmouth Evening News</span> and in 1951, aged still only twenty-one, he made it to Fleet Street as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. Once established in the national press he was determined not to allow the grass to grow under him. On 30 August 1952 he married Irene (<i>b</i>. 1931), an actress and dancer, and daughter of William Mainwood, a licensed victualler. They had a son and two daughters. In 1953 English left the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> for a stint on <span class="italic">Reynolds' News</span>, a Sunday newspaper. Then in 1956 he changed tack to become features editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, and learned something of the trade of the newspaper executive.<br>
<br>English did not enjoy being tied to a desk. He had an unfulfilled ambition to travel, and was able to satisfy it in 1959 when he joined the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, then near the end of its life, as New York correspondent. It was with this widening of his experience that the English legend really began to take shape. It was a legend he played an assiduous part in creating. In New York he boasted that he was the youngest foreign correspondent in the city, though he was silenced on discovering that the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>'s man was five years younger. When he qualified for a <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry he altered the date of his birth from 1930 to 1931, and that of his marriage from 1952 to 1954, for reasons that were never entirely clear but which were dismissed by colleagues as vanity. He sent a stream of front-page exclusives back to London, not suffering from the fact that when other journalists tried to follow many of them up for Monday's daily papers the basis on which they had been written was found to have been flimsy. One colleague, Alan Watkins, arriving to take up a post in New York, was warned from all sides that English was &#145;a sharp fellow, very sharp. He would readily pull a fast one and might even, if he thought it necessary, practise deception&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 12 June 1998). As far as Watkins was concerned the warning turned out to be unfounded, but English never quite threw off a reputation for sharpness, and indeed later seemed to revel in it. He was always ruthless, and saw no reason to be ashamed of that trait. Watkins wrote of the young English that he &#145;looked a decade younger than his 29 years and had about him something of the Artful Dodger. He fizzed&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>There was no faulting English's competence or professionalism, and when the <span class="italic">Dispatch</span> closed in 1960 he fell on his feet. He was hired by Lord Beaverbrook&#151;who had been warned that English sometimes &#145;chanced his arm&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 12 June 1998)&#151;to be the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>'s Washington correspondent. In 1963, after two successful years in Washington, he was promoted to the post of the <span class="italic">Express</span>'s chief American correspondent, retaining his base in the capital. He was not with the press party that accompanied John F. Kennedy to Dallas in November 1963, though he made his way there swiftly from New York once he heard the news of the president's death. This did not prevent him, as part of his later reminiscences about the event, from gilding the personal legend by implying that he had been present at the assassination.<br>
<br>In 1965 English returned to England to serve as foreign editor of the <span class="italic">Express</span>. After two years in the post he became an associate editor of the paper, and harboured legitimate expectations of succeeding as editor. He asked Max Aitken, who had succeeded his father Lord Beaverbrook as proprietor, to make him editor, only to be told that the <span class="italic">Express</span> already had one. He disregarded hints from Aitken that he was the heir apparent and accepted, in 1969, the editorship of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>. He was still only thirty-nine.<h2>
<a name="TheDailyMail"></a>The Daily Mail</h2>The <span class="italic">Sketch</span> was not in the best of health, with a declining readership and set in a contracting market. There was nothing that even someone of English's talent could do to save it by conventional journalistic means. However&#151;and this was typical of the shrewd operator he was&#151;he sought to devise a means that would benefit the paper's owners, Associated Newspapers, and, naturally enough, himself. Early in 1971 secret talks began with Vere Harmsworth (later Lord Rothermere), the deputy chairman of Associated, to merge the paper into a new-style <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, the flagship of the Harmsworth empire. English would edit the new <span class="italic">Mail</span> and it would give the <span class="italic">Express</span>&#151;then selling 3.5 million copies a day, twice the <span class="italic">Mail</span>'s circulation&#151;a run for its money. Harmsworth agreed, even though the plan involved the radical step of changing the <span class="italic">Mail</span> from a broadsheet to a tabloid&#151;or compact paper, as it was then called&#151;as well as closing the <span class="italic">Sketch</span>. Harmsworth's condition was that the new paper should look like the London <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> (which he later came to own), then a successful and popular tabloid. English had been thinking along the same lines, and the deal was done. Harmsworth, though, deserved credit for being astute enough to realize that English's entrepreneurial skills could be put to good use in the necessary modernization of his own newspapers. He also had a vision, which English grasped, of a paper aimed at modern women.<br>
<br>The operation, in May 1971, involved substantial casualties. The combined editorial staffs of the <span class="italic">Sketch</span> and the <span class="italic">Mail</span> were cut from 830 to just 320 on the new <span class="italic">Mail</span>. English did the sacking on what became known as &#145;the night of the long envelopes&#146;. He thrived on the challenge, but the struggle to establish the new-style paper was hard. &#145;It seems like only yesterday we were all working 19 hours a day trying to give birth to a new <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>&#146;, English wrote to his news editor two months after the change. &#145;Now we're working only 14 hours a day. I told you it would get better&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 12 June 1998). He believed that &#145;in a competitive world working in a winning environment makes people happy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 12 June 1998). He would win in the end, but happiness was not always inevitable. He would not hesitate to humiliate those who did not reach his own high standards. Loyal to those who served him well, he could bear deep grudges against those who did not.<br>
<br>Despite all English's efforts, however, the circulation of the <span class="italic">Mail</span> fell from 1.814 million to 1.754 million immediately after the change. In fact, things were worse than that. The 764,000 buyers of the <span class="italic">Sketch</span>, who were supposed to move over to the <span class="italic">Mail</span>, had vanished from Associated Newspapers and been picked up by the <span class="italic">Sun</span>. By August 1971 matters had become so bad that the paper was down to just twenty-four pages, but English refused to be cowed. To reverse this trend he embarked on more, and further-reaching, changes to the nature of his product. Most of his ideas proved highly successful in maintaining and then increasing his readership. He and Harmsworth were, however, helped by the entry of the <span class="italic">Express</span> into a long period of steep decline, and by that title's failure to modernize in response to what its main competitor had done. By the time of his retirement from the editorship in 1992 English had taken the <span class="italic">Mail</span>, from being so far behind the <span class="italic">Express</span>, to overhauling that paper's circulation&#151;though the <span class="italic">Mail</span>'s had, at 1.69 million, remained fairly static, while the <span class="italic">Express</span>'s had collapsed to 1.54 million.<br>
<br>Whereas Harmsworth's and English's idea had been to boost the <span class="italic">Mail</span>'s circulation significantly by making it far more attractive to women, what they in fact did was prevent sales being eroded at a time when the middle market in newspapers was rapidly contracting. English also had the great journalistic talent of sheer opportunism&#151;spotting at long range either a promotional opportunity or a story (or best of all a combination of the two) that would pull in more readers. He introduced the <span class="italic">Mail</span>'s Femail section not just as a magnet for the largely untapped market of women readers, but ensured it had a modern edge that was a far cry from the knitting patterns and recipes of most other Fleet Street women's pages. In the paper's news and features coverage he highlighted, and campaigned on, stories that reflected the concerns of his middle-class readers&#151;about family matters, the welfare of their children, the value of their property, and the decline of the country.<br>
<br>It was in relation to the last point that English threw his paper firmly behind Margaret Thatcher even before she had become leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. It was not just in the election campaign of 1979, but in the years leading up to it, that English acted as one of her cheerleaders and, eventually, confidants. However, in this, as in much of his management of the <span class="italic">Mail</span> brand, he learned valuable lessons from the formidable editor of the <span class="italic">Sun</span>, Albert (Larry) Lamb, who led the way in conviction and flair when it came to editing a tabloid paper. Ironically, given the effect the <span class="italic">Mail</span> had on the <span class="italic">Express</span>, English also applied at his paper lessons of populism and immediacy learned from the <span class="italic">Express</span> in happier days. The key to his success was that he identified his market precisely and then ensured that his paper appealed to it.<br>
<br>Such a brazen approach to news and the selling of newspapers as English had brought with it risks. As Saigon was about to fall in 1975 he had the <span class="italic">Mail</span> sponsor an airlift of ninety-nine small children to Britain. It was a fabulous coup, typical both of English's showmanship and of his opportunism. However, it later attracted criticism because while many of the children flourished in their new environment, others did not. The low point of English's career came in 1977. He published in the <span class="italic">Mail</span> a letter alleging that Lord Ryder, the chairman of the National Enterprise Board, knew of a slush fund for British Leyland, whose contents were used to pay bribes to secure overseas orders. The letter was a forgery and the fund did not exist. English offered his resignation after 123 MPs called for it, but Harmsworth did not accept it. One Labour MP even called for English to be tried for sedition, claiming the story was a deliberate attempt to bring down the government. Later, the Press Council criticized the <span class="italic">Mail</span> for hampering the police investigation into the case of the Yorkshire Ripper, and rebuked English for refusing to attend a hearing on the matter.<h2>
<a name="Success"></a>Success</h2>There were, though, conspicuous successes that made English indispensable to his masters. Not only did the <span class="italic">Mail</span> attract favourable publicity and more readers by a long-running campaign against the influence of the Moonies, it also won the long libel trial brought against the paper in 1981 by the Unification Church after a story headlined &#145;The church that breaks up families&#146;. In addition, once Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, the paper grew in influence, as did its editor. His own conspicuous contribution to the Conservative success was rewarded with a knighthood in 1982. By the late 1980s he had, it appeared, achieved his main ambition: the <span class="italic">Mail</span> had overtaken the circulation of the once mighty <span class="italic">Express</span>. Soon the <span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span> accomplished a similar feat over the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>. The part the <span class="italic">Mail</span> played in Thatcher's three election victories was significant, English's own version of the Thatcherite vision being broadcast to a growing readership with unerring certainty throughout her eleven years in power.<br>
<br>English was not only, by this time, a formidable figure in his own newspaper, but an increasingly towering one in the industry. He had more than an element of Machiavelli, and was regarded with ambivalence by many who worked with him. Much of this can be attributed to the envy of less original and less successful men; but English was a willing practitioner of the double standard when it suited him. He terrified some journalists who were of a mind to be terrified by him, but he also at times manipulated them rather than handled them. He was thought to have learned the technique of &#145;creative tension&#146; while in America. This would involve commissioning two journalists to write the same story, and then publishing the better result. It represented an almost Darwinian approach to man management, for only the fittest survived. He hoped for his own high personal standards to be emulated by his staff, though in this he was somewhat optimistic. He once withdrew a bureau chief from New York when he learned that the man had been conducting an extramarital affair, and later tried to prevent a reporter joining the <span class="italic">Mail</span> after it had been reported that he had been caught engaging in indecent acts in a public lavatory.<br>
<br>English's ruthlessness was masked, most of the time, by a carapace of charm. He had a distinctive high-pitched laugh, a slightly rasping voice, and a talent for bonhomie that grew the longer he spent in company with the rich, powerful, and famous. He was a sophisticated gossip, hugely enjoying any tales about colleagues, which he would wait to retail (with appropriate amplifications) until the moment when the effect would be most devastating. He could switch from charm to ferocity in an instant, and it was by such caprices and unpredictability that he kept all about him wary and on their toes. He was a small figure, always immaculately dressed, who in his later years relished playing the part of a Fleet Street elder statesman, and revelled in the influence he knew he had had on the rest of British journalism.<h2>
<a name="Editorialstyle"></a>Editorial style</h2>For all his occasional faults as a man manager English commanded immense loyalty, not least because under him the <span class="italic">Mail</span> became a newspaper that generally paid its staff well, and sacked people only rarely. The key to the respect in which he was held was that everyone who worked for him knew he could do any task he asked of them. Once his trust was won&#151;and winning it was an exacting process&#151;it was rarely withdrawn. He had a tremendous talent for turning poorly written raw copy into a compelling news story or feature, and as such he shaped the voice of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. He was also a brilliant talent spotter. As well as bringing on his eventual successor, Paul Dacre, he also filled the <span class="italic">Mail</span> with the most popular and authoritative columnists available, such as Nigel Dempster, Ian Wooldridge, and Lynda Lee-Potter. By the early 1990s, shortly before he handed over to Dacre, the <span class="italic">Mail</span> had become a byword for the middle market, which it dominated. Other newspapers, and not just in the <span class="italic">Mail</span>'s own market, strove to imitate wherever possible the style, tone, and approach that English had forged at his paper. Few succeeded in any measure, not least because English had usually cornered the market in the high-calibre journalists needed to maintain such a product.<br>
<br>Although he himself was not above the occasional lapse in taste, English deplored what he saw as the sleaziness of the &#145;red top&#146; tabloid newspapers such as the <span class="italic">Sun</span>, the <span class="italic">Star</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>. When he felt he noticed, in the mid-1990s, attempts by those papers to move towards the middle of the market, he thought he deserved some credit for it. Explaining his philosophy, he once said:<blockquote>It's simple, and very complex. The core is attention to detail. My view is that no story, no headline, no design, no subbing, nothing, is perfect. It can always be improved. That's what I mean by quality, keeping at it, never giving up. We've never wavered from that. Call it mainstream journalism, call it quality journalism, call it whatever you like. It's what makes the <span class="italic">Mail</span> titles special. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 11 June 1998)</blockquote>With the growth of his eminence came wider responsibilities. English had helped launch the <span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span> in 1982, and even edited it for a while during early teething troubles. He became vice-chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1986, then joint deputy chairman and editor-in-chief in 1989, and finally chairman in 1992, when he ceased editing the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> after twenty-one years. He and Rothermere maintained a formidable double act at the helm of the group until their sudden deaths, within months of each other, in 1998. From 1988 English was chairman both of New Era TV and of Burlington Magazines. In 1993 he became chairman of the cable television company Channel One, a rare unsuccessful business venture for him, and in 1997 he became chairman of ITN. He became president of the Commonwealth Press Union in 1994 and was active on the National Council for the Training of Journalists.<br>
<br>English sat on the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) from 1993, though it was his appointment as chairman of the editors' code committee of the commission that caused controversy over accusations of hypocrisy. The <span class="italic">Mail</span> had been accused of various intrusions of privacy, not least concerning Diana, princess of Wales. The chief shareholder of the Telegraph group, Conrad Black, said that in that light putting English in charge of a standards committee was &#145;like having appointed Al Capone as head of a commission to investigate organised crime in Chicago in the 1920s&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 12 June 1998). English did, however, preside over a committee that eventually produced a code with greatly strengthened provisions. He was also responsible for appointing Lord Wakeham as head of the PCC, which was regarded as means of toughening up self-regulation&#151;something English knew would be necessary if a privacy law were to be avoided.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life English became deeply disillusioned with the Conservative Party, and wrote in a mischievous diary in the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> magazine soon after Tony Blair's rise to the Labour leadership that he could foresee the day when the <span class="italic">Mail</span> would back &#145;new&#146; Labour. Lord Rothermere, as if to emphasize the point, signalled that he would sit on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. Whether English wrote what he did just to make waves or to curry favour is not clear, but it was revealed at the time of his death that he was to have been created a life peer in the 1998 birthday honours list.<br>
<br>English had a full life outside journalism. He had bought, and successfully ran, a chain of launderettes and a chain of free newspapers. Both ventures gave him the financial independence that allowed him to back his own judgement as a newspaper editor. They also made him, as an entrepreneur, a natural soulmate of Margaret Thatcher. He was devoted to his family, and especially to his wife, who was seriously ill for several years towards the end of his life. He enjoyed skiing and, especially, sailing his 40-foot motor cruiser.<br>
<br>It was his wide combination of talents that in the end made English the success he was. These included his journalist's nose for a good story, and his carefully honed skill in presenting a story in the most arresting way possible. Crucial to his success were his self-confidence, his determination, his ambition, his political judgement, his entrepreneurialism, and above all his ability to manipulate, exploit, and extract the best from others. His legacy was not just a newspaper that continued to grow mightily after he moved on, but a template for a compact newspaper that was copied and used around the world.<br>
<br>English suffered a stroke at his home in Westminster on 10 June 1998, and died shortly afterwards at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth. After a funeral service at St Bride's, Fleet Street, the journalists' church, he was buried on 18 June at Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland, where he and his family had enjoyed many skiing holidays. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
