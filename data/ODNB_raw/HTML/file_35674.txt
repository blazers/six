<span class="headword">Raper,  Robert William</span>  (1842&#150;1915), <span class="occ">college teacher and founder of university careers service</span>, was born at Llanwenarth, Monmouthshire, on 9 March 1842, the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel Timothy Raper (1790?&#150;1862), of the 19th foot regiment, and his wife, Christian Mary (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of Robert Steavenson MD of Newcastle upon Tyne. After being highly successful in the Ceylon expedition of 1815 his father settled at Hoe Court, Colwall, Herefordshire, on the west side of the Malvern hills. Raper's youngest brother, Allan Graeme Raper (1843&#150;1906), followed his father's career to become major-general of the 98th foot and North Staffordshire regiments and assistant quartermaster-general at the War Office from 1895 to 1900. Raper had four sisters, all of whom remained unmarried.<br>
<br>After spending two years at Cheltenham College from 1857 to 1859, Raper proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1861, but in his first term was elected to a scholarship at Trinity College. There in 1862 he obtained the university prizes for Greek and Latin verse and a first class in moderations, and in 1865 a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and a fellowship at Queen's College. Having been a lecturer in classics at Trinity from 1866, he was in 1871 elected under a special statute to a life fellowship there, and thenceforth took a leading part in the administration of the college, as bursar from 1887 and vice-president from 1894, remaining continuously in residence until his death. He would probably have been elected president in 1878 if laymen had then been eligible (he was a professed agnostic); in 1887, 1897, and 1907 he declined to accept the post.<br>
<br>In the university Raper soon acquired extensive though informal influence; he only once acted as an examiner, but he was a curator of the parks from 1885, of the botanic garden from 1887, and a visitor of the Ashmolean Museum from 1895 to 1908. He lectured mainly on favourite authors&#151;Homer, Virgil, Aristophanes, and Tacitus&#151;but he published nothing except articles in the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> (1885) and the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> (1913), a remarkable imitation of Walt Whitman in <span class="italic">Echoes from the Oxford Magazine</span> (1890), and a few brilliant versions in Latin verse in the <span class="italic">Nova anthologia Oxoniensis</span> of 1899. From 1907 it was Raper who supplied the Latin formulas required by the university's chancellor, Lord Curzon, of whom Raper had been a friend since Curzon's undergraduate days, and he managed to outdo Benjamin Jowett, another early friend, in a celebrated exchange (<span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Oxford</span>, s.v. Gordouli).<br>
<br>From an early date Raper's wide acquaintance with influential Oxford men enabled him to recommend Trinity men of promise and others for tutorial, scholastic, and secretarial posts&#151;it was usual for tutors in other colleges to advise their pupils to &#145;call on Mr Raper of Trinity and tell him I advised you to do so&#146;. Eventually, finding himself with more patronage than he had candidates to recommend, and stimulated by the earlier success of Professor W. J. Lewis in establishing the Cambridge Scholastic Agency to place graduates in teaching posts, in 1892 he founded the Oxford University Appointments Committee (OUAC). This was the earliest agency for the placement of graduates set up in any British university by a representative body of dons; Cambridge followed suit in 1899. Raper was chairman of OUAC (renamed the Oxford University Careers Service in 1991) from 1892 to 1899, and a permanent member from 1908 until his death.<br>
<br>As an accomplished cricketer, rider, and skater, Raper was familiar with athletes as well as with reading men, and favoured making the services of OUAC available to women (1899); but he was best known, especially in his own college, as a genial and judicious host, a sagacious and witty counsellor&#151;&#145;silent and infinitely wise&#146; according to John Buchan  (<span class="italic">Memory Hold the Door</span>, 1940, 49)&#151;and a sympathetic and, on the whole, sound disciplinarian; his bursarial notices to undergraduates of Trinity were lucid and entertaining.<br>
<br>Raper was not drawn into public life except in connection with the preservation of open spaces. Aided by his Colwall neighbour Stephen Ballard (1804&#150;1890), he defended the rights both of the commoners and of the general public to the enjoyment of the Malvern hills. With the help of John Gent (1844&#150;1927), his colleague in jurisprudence at Trinity, he obtained the <span class="roman">Malvern Hills Conservation Act</span> in 1884, by which he was named as a conservator; he was chairman of the conservators from 1884 to 1890. Raper himself gave 16 acres of land. In later life he lost local influence and became entangled in controversy and even litigation; but he was not unsupported, and in 1905 and later he conveyed some more land and manorial rights, which he had purchased to prevent encroachments and to control quarrying. He was named by Oxford University as its representative on the council of the National Trust from 1895, serving on an important subcommittee which considered the question of the protection of places or sites.<br>
<br>Raper was a small man, with straggling hair and a pointed beard. He was unmarried. As a young man he was somewhat of an invalid, but later enjoyed life fully, until he failed rather rapidly, and died suddenly in his college rooms on 15 July 1915. He was buried at Colwall.<br>
