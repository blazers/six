<span class="headword">Spencer,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Ignatius of St Paul]</span>  (1799&#150;1864), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born at Admiralty House, London, on 21 December 1799, the youngest of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer (1758&#150;1834)")</script>, first lord of the Admiralty, and his wife, Lavinia (1762&#150;1831), daughter of Charles Bingham, first earl of Lucan. He had four brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26133/', "John Charles Spencer")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26136/', "Robert Cavendish Spencer")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26122/', "Frederick Spencer")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26136/', "Spencer, Robert Cavendish")</script>], and three sisters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38715/', "Sarah Lyttelton")</script>; one brother and a sister, however, died in infancy. After education at home, Spencer went to Eton College, before proceeding in 1817 to Trinity College, Cambridge, to read classics, mathematics, and divinity. Placed in the first class in both the 1818 and the 1819 examinations, he received his MA in 1819. He was ordained a deacon of the Church of England on 22 December 1822 and priest on 13 June 1824; in January 1825 he became rector of St Mary's, Brington, on the family's Althorp estate. After a chance encounter with Father William Foley of Northampton and subsequent discussions with him and with Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle, Spencer was received into the Roman Catholic church in Leicester by a Belgian Dominican priest, Father Charles Caestryck, on 30 January 1830. He then went to the English College, Rome, to study for the Catholic priesthood and was ordained on the feast of St Augustine of Canterbury, 26 May 1832, in the church of St Gregory the Great on the Coelian Hill. While he was in Rome he met Father Dominic Barberi, professor of theology at the Passionist retreat of saints John and Paul. Spencer returned to England and was appointed to Walsall in August 1832, and in November 1832 to West Bromwich, with responsibility also for Dudley.<br>
<br>Although massively built, Spencer was physically delicate, and it was a serious illness in 1838 which brought about the beginning of his life's work: his Crusade of Prayer for Unity in the Truth. Sent to the continent to recuperate, he was invited to address the French clergy at St Sulpice in Paris. When his request for prayers for the conversion of England was favourably received, he extended it wherever he travelled and, on his return to England, throughout the British Isles. In January 1840 he went to Oxford to ask John Henry Newman and his followers to pray for unity in the truth. Newman later wrote in his <span class="italic">Apologia pro vita sua</span> that he could have &#145;laughed for joy&#146; to see him. He refused to dine with him, however, because he regarded him as &#145;<i>in loco apostatae</i> [an apostate] from the Anglican Church&#146;. Nevertheless he did draw up prayers for reunion. The modern movement for Christian unity may be said to date from their meeting. The decree on ecumenism, <span class="italic">Unitatis redintegratio</span>, issued by the Second Vatican Council in 1964, owed much to Spencer's inspiration and writings.<br>
<br>In 1839 Spencer was appointed to St Mary's College, Oscott, as spiritual director. In 1839&#150;41 he was largely responsible for facilitating Father Dominic Barberi's foundation of the Passionist congregation in England, and in 1846&#150;7 he entered the Passionist noviciate at Aston Hall near Stone, Staffordshire, taking the religious name Ignatius of St Paul. From his profession of vows in January 1848 he travelled throughout the British Isles and Europe, preaching the passion and seeking prayers for the conversion of England and the sanctification of Ireland. He also advocated temperance. Between 1849 and 1864, in co-operation with Father Gaudentius Rossi, CP, and Elizabeth Prout, he was instrumental in founding the Sisters of the Cross and Passion, a new religious congregation with no dowry requirements for admission and no class distinctions. He also assisted this congregation to provide homes for factory girls.<br>
<br>Spencer died suddenly from a heart attack at Monteith House, Carstairs, Lanarkshire, on 1 October 1864. His remains were conveyed to St Anne's Passionist Retreat, Sutton, St Helens, where he had been rector, and his funeral took place on 5 October 1864. He was interred in the crypt, but in 1973 his remains were removed to a side chapel in the new church of St Anne and Blessed Dominic in Sutton, where they lie beside those of Blessed Dominic Barberi and Elizabeth Prout. The cause for his canonization was introduced in June 1992.<br>
