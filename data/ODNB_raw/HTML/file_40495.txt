<span class="headword">Jacson,  Frances Margaretta</span>  (1754&#150;1842), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 13 October 1754 at Bebington rectory, Cheshire, one of the five surviving children of the Revd Simon Jacson (1728&#150;1808) and his wife, Anne Fitzherbert (<i>c</i>.1729&#150;1795), elder daughter of Richard Fitzherbert of Somersal Herbert, Derbyshire. Her elder brothers, Roger and Shallcross, both took holy orders, and in 1771 her father relinquished his living in favour of Roger, the heir, who quickly became a much respected incumbent. Of the three daughters, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1805) married into the Atherton family in Lancashire, but Frances and her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40494/', "Maria Elizabetha Jacson (1755&#150;1829)")</script> remained single, moving from Bebington with their parents to Stockport and then to Tarporley, where Simon Jacson took up the rectorship. There the sisters cared for their father, particularly after their mother's death in 1795. He became increasingly infirm, and died in 1808.<br>
<br>It was during their time at Tarporley that the Jacsons became increasingly concerned about Shallcross, who, over-fond of drink and horse-racing, had run into debt and was hardly an ornament to the church or to a respected clerical family. To help him out of his difficulties the sisters turned to writing, Maria to manuals on botany and gardening, and Frances to fiction. Her popular first novel, <span class="italic">Plain Sense</span> (1795), was followed in 1797 by <span class="italic">Disobedience</span>. In 1808 the sisters had to find a new home and after much uncertainty they gratefully accepted the offer of Somersal Hall, the beautiful old partly Tudor house lent them for life by Lord St Helens, a Fitzherbert relation. Shallcross's troubles soon resurfaced, and at Somersal Frances wrote, in the same vein as her first two books, <span class="italic">Things by their Right Names</span> (1812) and the more accomplished <span class="italic">Rhoda</span> (1816). Appalled by her brother's physical and mental state, and with the help of Roger and Maria Jacson, Frances again arranged to clear his debts, now amounting to &pound;1760. His unlooked for death in 1821 was a melancholy release.<br>
<br>A period of calm followed with <span class="italic">Isabella</span>, Frances's last book, published in 1823, but then in 1829 Maria fell gravely ill, and died while the sisters were staying with friends at Chelford. Returning desolate to Somersal, the unhappy Frances eventually settled, resuming her social life among the local gentry and family connections: the Vernons at Sudbury, the Fitzherberts at Tissington, and her friends at Ashbourne. Among her many nieces and nephews, Henry Gally Knight was a special favourite and kept her in touch with the politics of the time. A firm whig, she had scant sympathy for the waverings of William IV over the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, recording that &#145;the poltroony of the King&#146; and the duplicity of the tories &#145;shocked every moral feeling&#146;  (diary, 18 May 1832).<br>
<br>However immediate a financial purpose her novels served, Frances Jacson never abandoned her moral feeling. She was a devout Christian and all her novels have a strong didactic element, as is suggested by the titles of the first three. All are set in high circles of society, moving between London (the site of temptation, libertinism, and schemers) and country estates and parsonages (havens largely though not entirely beneficial). All feature a heroine, tracing her history through varying circumstances, some of doubtful probability, but not more so than others in the genre. Plotting was not Frances Jacson's strength but what becomes increasingly evident is the author's creative insight into character and motive, exposed through her accounts of developing relationships, particularly of courtship and marriage. The rather flat Ellen in <span class="italic">Plain Sense</span> excepted, Jacson's lively heroines are convincingly shown evaluating their surroundings and coming to see the flaws in their perceptions, or those of others. Moreover, her minor characters are often presented with highly effective irony, and many of the situations depicted with considerable humour. In <span class="italic">Rhoda</span>, for example, Jacson outlines the heroine's growing worldliness, and sympathetically depicts the workings of her mind as she struggles with dilemmas; the incompatibilities in Rhoda's marriage with Sir James Osbourne are both insurmountable and sad. Offset is the clever contrast of the sourness of the marriage of Mr and Mrs Strickland, the latter who &#145;always admitted truth in the abstract and never practised it in detail&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rhoda</span>, bk 2, 160). Equally skilfully drawn is Mrs Nesbit in <span class="italic">Isabella</span>, whose self-righteous loquacity makes her a worthy sister to Jane Austen's Mrs Norris.<br>
<br>Frances Jacson died on 17 June 1842 at her home in Somersal and was buried in the Fitzherbert vault there on 24 June. Her only other known writing is a religious pamphlet, <span class="italic">Every Day Christianity</span> (1816).<br>
<br>Frances Jacson's novels enjoyed considerable contemporary popularity; <span class="italic">Rhoda</span> was singled out by Maria Edgeworth as superior to Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Emma</span>, and it was also admired by Sydney Smith, who recommended it to Lady Holland. Although her works have obvious limitations, Jacson's gifts are well worth recognition in any history of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English novel. The novels' anonymity was guarded, and her authorship faded into obscurity, so that secure assignment of the novels to her took place only in the late 1990s. Despite the twentieth-century interest in women writers of the past, Jacson has been neglected, probably in part because of an earlier confusion of her works with those of Alethea Lewis (pseudonym Eugenia de Acton). Her eclipse may also be due to the fact that her diaries, written from 1829 until her death, were originally thought to have been written by her brother.<br>
