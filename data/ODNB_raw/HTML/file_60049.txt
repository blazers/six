<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devant,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>David Wighton]</span>  (1868&#150;1941), <span class="occ">conjuror and illusionist</span>, was born on 22 February 1868 at 4 Boston Terrace, Holloway, London, eldest of the seven children of James Wighton, a Scottish artist, and his wife, Mary Ansell. After attending local schools he worked at several jobs before becoming a professional entertainer. His interest in magic was aroused when he was about twelve and was fuelled by visits to Maskelyne and Cooke's <span class="italic">Mysteries</span> at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London. At seventeen he gave his first public performance as David Devant, the surname being adopted from a French painting of David and Goliath entitled <span class="italic">David devant Goliath</span>. About 1888 he married Annie Marion Melville (1864/5&#150;1928), who as his stage assistant was known as Marion Melville; they had a daughter, Vida (<i>d</i>. 1954), but apparently neither marriage nor birth was registered. Soon Devant was appearing at music-halls, where John Nevil Maskelyne saw and engaged him. For his d&eacute;but at the Egyptian Hall in 1893 he devised a new illusion, &#145;The Artist's Dream&#146;, in which the portrait of a young woman came to life. There followed more than two decades of highly productive continuous association with Maskelyne, with whom he went into partnership as Maskelyne and Devant at St George's Hall, London, from 1905 until 1915.<br>
<br>Devant's formative years were influenced by the inventive French magician Buatier de Kolta and by the gentlemanly, humorous presentation of Charles Bertram, the leading society magician of the time. Indeed, a characteristic of Devant's presentation was his &#145;drawing-room&#146; style and his tremendous success undoubtedly derived from personal charm and a refreshingly new approach to the art. Thus he discarded the magic wand and any apparatus which might appear to have been made especially for conjuring purposes, reasoning that suspicion would thereby be allayed. He created numerous small tricks and more than twenty ingenious illusions, probably the finest being &#145;The Mascot Moth&#146; (1905), the disappearance in full view of a woman, dressed as a moth with wings, when Devant approached her with a lighted candle. Another was &#145;Biff&#146; (1913), in which a motorcycle and rider vanished from a wooden crate hoisted in the air. An outstanding feature of his illusions was that none involved the theme of mutilation: the element of horror was banished and his slogan of &#145;all done by kindness&#146; never dispelled.<br>
<br>When the Lumi&egrave;re brothers' films were first demonstrated in London in 1896, Devant immediately realized their potential. He purchased a theatrograph machine from R. W. Paul, becoming the first independent operator in Britain, with three provincial touring companies besides exhibiting films at the Egyptian Hall. Devant toured with versions of the Maskelyne and Cooke entertainment during the late 1890s and early 1900s, extending his popularity to the provinces. Later, in 1912&#150;13, when managing director of Maskelyne and Devant, he toured the music-halls, and he returned to this activity in 1915 after severing his connection with Maskelyne.<br>
<br>When the Magic Circle was founded in London in 1905 Devant became its first president and donated his personal library to the society, but he retired from office after one year due to pressure of work. As a consequence of magazine articles he wrote exposing magical secrets, contrary to the society's rules, his resignation was tendered in 1910, and requested in 1936; after the first time he was reinstated in 1912, and after the second he was elected to honorary life membership in 1937.<br>
<br>Throughout his active performing days Devant was the subject of numerous magazine and newspaper articles as well as himself being a prolific contributor. Additionally he was the author of eight substantial books, including <span class="italic">Our Magic</span> (1911), written in collaboration with Nevil Maskelyne (J. N. Maskelyne's eldest son). He appeared in the first royal command variety performance at the Palace Theatre, London, in 1912, assisted by his daughter, Vida, and Nevil Maskelyne's son Jasper. Such now was his reputation that he received a testimonial address and silver plate from magicians worldwide at St George's Hall on 3 February the next year.<br>
<br>At the height of his powers Devant was stricken with a progressive palsy and retired from public performing at the end of 1919. In retirement he gave lessons on conjuring and continued to write magazine articles and books, including his autobiography, <span class="italic">My Magic Life</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Secrets of my Magic</span> (1936), an important work on illusions. Devant's wife died in 1928 and his daughter in 1954. Progressive incapacitation, throughout which he was tended by his companion, William Curtis, led in June 1937 to Devant's admission to the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Putney, where he died (of paralysis agitans according to the death certificate) on 13 October 1941, aged seventy-three, acclaimed &#145;the foremost magician of all time&#146; by <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary. He was buried on 17 October at Highgate old (west) cemetery.<br>
