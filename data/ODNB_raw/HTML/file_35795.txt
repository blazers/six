<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  John Charles</span>  (1824&#150;1913), <span class="occ">museum curator and art collector</span>, was born on 16 December 1824 in Nottingham, the son of Alfred Robinson. He was brought up by his grandfather, a bookseller, and educated in Nottingham. Originally intending to train as an architect, he turned instead to painting, and studied in the studio of Michel-Martin Drolling in Paris. While there, he laid the foundations of his knowledge of a wide field of the fine and decorative arts. Returning to England in 1847, he taught at the School of Design in Hanley, Staffordshire. In 1852, he went to London to work as a teachers' training master, but was soon appointed curator of the Museum of Ornamental Art at Marlborough House. In 1857 the collection moved to the newly established South Kensington (later Victoria and Albert) Museum, where Robinson worked until 1867, his post changing in 1863 to that of art referee. He built up the museum's collection of Italian Renaissance sculpture, acquiring many pieces from the Gigli and Campana collections in Rome. Robinson's catalogue <span class="italic">Italian Sculpture of the Middle Ages and Period of the Revival of Art</span> (1862) was a landmark in the scholarly study of the subject. In the same year he organized the immense special loan exhibition of medieval and Renaissance works of art at the museum. He developed the collections in many other areas, and in the 1860s travelled to Spain and Portugal, where he acquired a selection of works of art from the Iberian peninsula which rendered the museum unique in Europe. In 1856 Robinson organized a collectors' club, to hold evening receptions, conversazioni, and exhibitions; in 1857 this became the Fine Arts Club, which later merged gradually with the Burlington Fine Arts Club, formed in 1866, with Robinson as first president. The club fulfilled an important function at a time when loan exhibitions were rare. With his friend Sir Francis Seymour Haden, Robinson also founded the Royal Society of Painter Etchers; a collection of etchings by Robinson is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>Robinson's taste was in many ways advanced for his period, not only in his love for earlier Italian painting and sculpture, but also in his admiration for Piero della Francesca, whose <span class="italic">Baptism</span> (National Gallery, London) he acquired in Italy in 1860, and in his interest in early Spanish painting, in particular the work of El Greco, whose <span class="italic">Christ Expelling the Money-Changers from the Temple</span> Robinson presented to the National Gallery in 1895. His own collections were vast and included paintings, drawings and prints, sculpture, medals and gems, ceramics, tapestry, and embroidery. By the age of thirty-six he had amassed a phenomenal collection of drawings which passed <i>en bloc</i> in 1860 to John Malcolm of Poltalloch; it is now in the British Museum. He helped a number of other private collectors to form their cabinets, particularly Sir Francis Cook, to whom he sold 100 paintings in 1860 and many more during the course of their association.<br>
<br>In 1870 Robinson wrote the seminal <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Drawings by Michael Angelo and Raffaelle in the University Galleries at Oxford</span>, the first <i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> of a group of drawings. He helped to organize the syndicate which attended the Fountaine sale at Christies on 16 June 1884 to prevent the random dispersal of an important cabinet of ceramics. From 1882 to 1901 he was surveyor of the queen's pictures. He was knighted in 1887 and made a CB in 1901. He continued to be active in the art world into his eighties, and was a dominant critic and controversialist. He was noted by contemporaries not just for the scope of his collections and the quality of his eye, but also for his indefatigable energy and for the tenacity of his opinions.<br>
<br>On 24 December 1852 Robinson had married Marian Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of the lawyer Edmund Newton of Norwich; they had five sons and two daughters. They lived in London, first at York Place, and then at 107 Harley Street. In 1874 Robinson had bought Newton Manor in Swanage, and he died there on 10 April 1913. He was buried at Marlborough in Wiltshire.<br>
