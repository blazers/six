<span class="headword">kings of the East Saxons</span>  (<em>act. </em>late 6th cent.&#150;<em>c.</em>820), <span class="occ">rulers in the area of modern Essex and London</span>, traced their descent from Sledd, who must have flourished in the late sixth century. He was married to Ricula, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8902/', "King &#198;thelberht of Kent")</script>, and their son <a name="cosubject_24996"></a><span class="headword">S&aelig;berht</span>  (<em>d.</em> 616/17)<span class="occ"></span> recognized the overlordship of his uncle. At the instigation of &AElig;thelberht, S&aelig;berht was converted to Christianity in 604, and Mellitus, one of the second wave of Italian missionaries dispatched by Pope Gregory to Kent, was appointed the first bishop of the East Saxons. It was &AElig;thelberht, not S&aelig;berht, who was remembered as the founder of St Paul's in London for Mellitus's episcopal seat, although London was apparently regarded as part of East Saxon territory. When S&aelig;berht died in or soon after 616, he was succeeded by his three sons, two of whom (as is known from the East Saxon genealogies) were called <a name="cosubject_25152"></a><span class="headword">Seaxred</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 617)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_57730"></a><span class="headword">S&aelig;ward</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 617)<span class="occ"></span>. The sons had not been converted to Christianity, and expelled Mellitus when, according to Bede, he would not allow them to have some of his communion bread. Mellitus was obliged to return to Kent. The brothers were killed not long after in battle with the Gewisse, which Bede saw as just punishment for their rejection of the true faith. Little is known of their successor <a name="cosubject_25530"></a><span class="headword">Sigeberht I</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Sigeberht Parvus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>626)<span class="occ"></span>, though he too seems to have been a pagan. However, the next king, <a name="cosubject_25532"></a><span class="headword">Sigeberht II</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Sigeberht Sanctus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>653)<span class="occ"></span>, who was probably the son of King S&aelig;ward, was converted through the influence of his overlord, King Oswiu of Northumbria, and was baptized <i>c</i>.653 by Bishop Finan on a Northumbrian royal estate near Hadrian's Wall. As a result of Oswiu's intervention, Cedd (who had been trained at Lindisfarne) was dispatched to become the second bishop of the East Saxons. However, Sigeberht's change in religion was not approved by all his court, and he was murdered by two brothers (who were also his kinsmen) on the grounds that by being too willing to spread Christian forgiveness to his enemies, he was not sufficiently honouring his supporters. His successor <a name="cosubject_57731"></a><span class="headword">Swithhelm</span>  (<em>d.</em> 663)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of Seaxbald, who is otherwise unknown. He too came to the throne a pagan, but was baptized by Cedd in the East Anglian royal palace at Rendlesham with King &AElig;thelwold of the East Angles as his sponsor.<br>
<br>On Swithhelm's death in 663, two kings succeeded jointly to the throne&#151;<a name="cosubject_25539"></a><span class="headword">Sigehere</span>  (<em>fl. </em>663&#150;664)<span class="occ"></span>, who was probably the son of Sigeberht Sanctus, and <a name="cosubject_24995"></a><span class="headword">S&aelig;bbi</span>  (<em>d.</em> 693/4)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of King Seaxred. They seem to have divided the kingdom between them. Sigehere and his portion of the East Saxon people reverted to paganism after the outbreak of the great plague of 664, and incurred the wrath of their overlord King Wulfhere of the Mercians, who seems to have interpreted rejection of Christianity as rejection of his own authority. Jaruman, bishop of the Mercians, was dispatched to restore the true religion. S&aelig;bbi, in contrast, appears to have been an enthusiastic convert who considered renouncing his throne to become a monk, earning the comment from Bede &#145;that a man of his disposition ought to have been a bishop rather than a king&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.11). In the end S&aelig;bbi became a monk only when he fell ill shortly before his death in 693 or 694. He was buried in St Paul's, in a stone sarcophagus which apparently miraculously lengthened in order to accommodate the king's body. He was subsequently regarded as a saint.<br>
<br>Although Sigehere does not seem to have had the same inclinations as his co-ruler, a cult did develop around his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20931/', "Osgyth (Osyth)")</script>, the founder of a nunnery at Chich, Essex. Charters surviving from the time of Sigehere and S&aelig;bbi reveal that there were other sub-kings of the East Saxons during their reigns who may have had charge of dependent territories. The area that is now Surrey was sporadically under East Saxon control in the late seventh century, and Sigehere's wife was reputedly the daughter of Frithuwald, who had been a Mercian under-king of the province. The East Saxons also attempted to extend their control into west Kent. Sigehere may have ruled there briefly, perhaps in collaboration with C&aelig;dwalla of Wessex (<i>r</i>. 685&#150;8). S&aelig;bbi's son Sw&aelig;fheard was more successful and ruled as king of part of Kent for a number of years (687/8&#150;692&times;4), until Wihtred, who had shared rule with him, gained complete control. However, in spite of these successes charter attestations suggest that Sigehere and S&aelig;bbi generally recognized Mercian overlordship, apart possibly from a brief interlude of West Saxon authority during the reign of C&aelig;dwalla. Sigehere probably predeceased S&aelig;bbi and when the latter died he was succeeded by his two sons <a name="cosubject_25538"></a><span class="headword">Sigeheard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>693/4)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_26761"></a><span class="headword">Sw&aelig;fred</span>  (<em>fl. </em>693/4)<span class="occ"></span>. Not much is known of these two kings, though Sigeheard was a patron of St Paul's and Sw&aelig;fred founder of a double monastery at Nazeing, Essex. They became embroiled in serious, but unspecified, conflicts with Ine of Wessex in the early eighth century, which the bishops of the two kingdoms attempted to resolve through mediation. The dispute is the subject of the earliest surviving original letter in Europe, from Waldhere, bishop of the East Saxons, to Berhtwald, archbishop of Canterbury. Also exercising some kind of royal authority during their reign was <a name="cosubject_20566"></a><span class="headword">Offa</span>  (<em>fl. </em>709)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Sigehere and Osgyth, whose name marks a departure from the use of names beginning with &#145;S&#146; which otherwise seems to have been rigidly adhered to by male members of the royal house. Offa abdicated and left for Rome in 709 with Cenred who had formerly been king of the Mercians and overlord of Sigeheard and Sw&aelig;fred.<br>
<br>It is not known when Sigeheard and Sw&aelig;fred ceased to rule, and their eighth-century successors are shadowy figures. Attested rulers include: <a name="cosubject_57734"></a><span class="headword">Sw&aelig;fbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 738)<span class="occ"></span>; <a name="cosubject_25062"></a><span class="headword">Selered</span>  (<em>d.</em> 746)<span class="occ"></span>, a descendant of a brother of S&aelig;berht; <a name="cosubject_57735"></a><span class="headword">Swithred</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>746)<span class="occ"></span>, grandson of King Sigeheard; and <a name="cosubject_57736"></a><span class="headword">Sigeric</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 798)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Selered, who abdicated in 798. Mercian overlordship continued, and &AElig;thelbald and Offa detached London and the surrounding Middle Saxon province from East Saxon control. However, the East Saxon rulers seem to have retained their regalian rights in Essex and issued their own <i>sceatta</i> coinage. The last independent East Saxon ruler was probably <a name="cosubject_25535"></a><span class="headword">Sigered</span>  (<em>fl. </em>811)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Sigeric, who was ruling in 811, though recognizing Mercian supremacy. Sigered may have been expelled in 825 when the East Saxons surrendered to Ecgberht of Wessex and became a West Saxon dependency. Even after the West Saxon take-over, there is a surviving reference to a Sigeric styled king of the East Saxons in the entourage of King Wiglaf of the Mercians.<br>
