<span class="headword">Vyse,  Richard William Howard</span>  (1784&#150;1853), <span class="occ">army officer and Egyptologist</span>, born on 25 July 1784, was the only son of General Richard Vyse and his second wife, Anne (only surviving daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13900/', "Field Marshal Sir George Howard")</script>), whom he married on 20 May 1780.<br>
<br>The father, <a name="cosubject_28360"></a><span class="headword">Richard Vyse</span>  (1746&#150;1825), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Lichfield on 11 July 1746, was the younger son of William Vyse (1710&#150;1770), canon residentiary and treasurer of Lichfield, and younger brother of William Vyse (1741&#150;1816), canon residentiary and chancellor of Lichfield. His mother, Catherine, was daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25732/', "Richard Smalbroke")</script>, bishop of Lichfield. He was appointed cornet in the 5th dragoons on 13 February 1763. He attained the brevet rank of colonel on 7 January 1781, received the command of the 1st dragoon guards on 28 May 1784, and during the Revolutionary War served in Flanders in command of a brigade under the duke of York. He distinguished himself on several occasions, particularly at the battle of Le Cateau on 25 April 1794, where, at the head of two brigades of heavy cavalry, he significantly contributed to the victory, and at the evacuation of Ostend, which he superintended on 1 July. Vyse was promoted major-general on 2 October 1794, and lieutenant-general on 1 January 1801. In 1799 he became the duke of Cumberland's comptroller. Frustrated in attempting to further his military career, he became MP for Beverley in 1806; he supported Cumberland and his faction, but made way for his son in 1807. He became general on 1 January 1812, and died at Lichfield on 30 May 1825.<br>
<br>His son, Richard William, assumed the additional name of Howard by royal sign manual, dated 14 September 1812, on inheriting the estates of Boughton and Pitsford in Northamptonshire through his maternal grandmother, Lucy, daughter of Thomas Wentworth, second earl of Strafford. Vyse entered the army as cornet in the 1st dragoons on 5 May 1800, and was promoted lieutenant in the 15th dragoons on 17 June 1801 and captain on 29 June 1802. In 1809 he acted as aide-de-camp to his father on the staff of the Yorkshire district, and on 5 July 1810 received the honorary degree of DCL from Oxford University. He married, on 13 November 1810, Frances, second daughter of Henry Hesketh of Newton, Cheshire. They had eight sons and two daughters. Like his father, he enjoyed the duke of Cumberland's patronage, being his equerry 1813&#150;37. He attained the brevet rank of major on 4 June 1813, and was made captain in the 87th foot on 31 August 1815 and in the 2nd Life Guards on 5 July 1816; he was appointed major in the 1st West India regiment on 4 January 1819, and in the 2nd Life Guards on 4 February in the same year. On 13 May he attained the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel, and was placed on half pay on 10 September 1825. On 10 January 1837 he was raised to the rank of colonel, and on 9 November 1846 to that of major-general.<br>
<br>Vyse was returned to parliament for Beverley on 8 May 1807. He voted against Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. In October 1812 he was elected MP for Honiton in Devon, which he retained until the dissolution of 1818. In 1824 he was high sheriff for Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>In 1835 Vyse visited Egypt and Syria, and became very interested in the excavations being undertaken at Giza. He then spent over a year excavating and exploring the pyramids. In January 1837 he obtained the assistance of John Shae Perring, and, although he returned to England in August, he provided the funds for Perring's subsequent explorations to the south of Giza and at Abu Roash. The researches of Vyse and Perring were important in surveying and measuring the pyramids. Vyse published <span class="italic">Operations Carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837</span> (2 vols., 1840), followed in 1842 by a third supplemental volume devoted to Perring's researches at Abu Roash. Vyse died at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, on 8 June 1853.<br>
