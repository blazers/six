<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martyr <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thornton]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1761/2&#150;1807), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was the daughter of Mr Thornton, a London tailor, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1788). A pupil of James Hook, she sang his music at Vauxhall Gardens in the summers of 1778&#150;80. Miss Thornton appeared at Covent Garden Theatre for a few months in 1779, making her d&eacute;but as Rosetta in the comic opera <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> on 13 February. She married Captain Martyr (<i>d</i>. 1783), whose forename is not known, a half-pay officer, before her return to Covent Garden in November 1780. She was not yet nineteen at this time  (&#145;Histories of the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te annexed&#146;, 484). An attractive brunette, &#145;sportive, playful, arch, and free&#146;  (Bellamy, 25), she excelled in lively second-woman roles in English operas and musical afterpieces, such as Lucy in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, Euphrosyne in Thomas Arne's music for <span class="italic">Comus</span>, and Phoebe in Frances Brooke's <span class="italic">Rosina</span>. William Shield composed and arranged the music for <span class="italic">Rosina</span>, as he did for many of the works by John O'Keeffe which included parts for her. She created and played for many years the roles of Kathlane in <span class="italic">The Poor Soldier</span> (1783), Flora in <span class="italic">Love in a Camp</span> (1786), and Molly Maybush in <span class="italic">The Farmer</span> (1787). In his <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, O'Keeffe recorded that he wrote the part of George Streamer, &#145;a sprightly little midshipman&#146;  (p. 413), especially for her in <span class="italic">Sprigs of Laurel</span> (1793). Her &#145;neat breeches figure&#146;  (Haslewood, 140) was also shown to advantage in one of her most popular roles, the page in <span class="italic">The Follies of a Day</span> (1784). In this adaptation of Beaumarchais's <span class="italic">Le mariage de Figaro</span> she sang to the countess the play's only song, Shield's &#145;Ah weladay my poor heart&#146;.<br>
<br>Margaret Martyr's marriage was not a success, since her husband got into debt and gossip claimed that she was unfaithful. Martyr fled to France to escape his creditors and news of his death at Calais reached his widow on 1 October 1783. Some later accounts claim that he died in the king's bench prison, but the prison records do not bear this out. A tempestuous liaison with James Wild, the company's prompter, seems to have ended in summer 1784, after which she established a lasting relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21290/', "William Thomas Parke (1761&#150;1847)")</script>, the principal oboist at Covent Garden from 1783. They were living together at 16 Martlet Court, Bow Street, by April 1790, but gossip in the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> for 31 January 1787 shows that their love affair was already common knowledge. She sang at Vauxhall Gardens, where Parke was a regular performer, in 1786 and 1789. They appeared together in the summer vacations in the English provinces and went together to Dublin, Limerick, and Cork in 1796. Parke wrote in his <span class="italic">Musical Memoirs</span> of their success when she sang Arne's &#145;Sweet Echo&#146; from <span class="italic">Comus</span> to his oboe obbligato at Birmingham and Cheltenham. They had two children, William Byrne Parke (<i>b</i>. 1799) and Henry Parke (<i>b</i>. 1800), but never married. Margaret, her daughter by Captain Martyr, trained as a singer and was described in 1801 as the favourite pupil of Madame Mara (Gertrud Elisabeth Mara). Miss Martyr sang in London oratorios and provincial music festivals for a couple of years but later became a minor actress.<br>
<br>Mrs Martyr was &#145;a very great favourite, but never a very great actress, or very great singer&#146;, who always seemed &#145;to be in a good humour with herself and the audience&#146;  (Wilson, 30, 32). At Covent Garden she received the high salary of &pound;10 a week until the 1799&#150;1800 season, but after the birth of her sons she made fewer advertised appearances. In October 1804 she was billed as playing the page in <span class="italic">Follies of a Day</span>, the lively maid Susan in the operatic farce <span class="italic">Hartford Bridge</span>, and Catherine in the comic opera <span class="italic">Netley Abbey</span>, where, disguised as a sailor lad, she performed Parke's song &#145;Yo! heave ho!&#146;. Her obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> stated that &#145;for upwards of seven months she had been in a rapid state of decline, which the most skilful medical aid was unable to resist&#146;  (p. 597), but she remained on the weekly salary list at Covent Garden Theatre until the day before her death on 7 June 1807. She was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 14 June 1807. Her will appointed Parke as her sole executor and left half of the proceeds from the sale of a farm she owned at Yalding in Kent to her daughter and a quarter-share to each of her two sons.<br>
