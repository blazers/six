<span class="headword">Fisher,  John Abraham</span>  (1744&#150;1806), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, the son of Richard Fisher. He was brought up in the home of James O'Hara, second Baron Tyrawley, in Blackheath, and had violin lessons from Thomas Pinto, principal violinist at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, London. He was admitted to the Royal Society of Musicians in 1764. Fisher made his d&eacute;but at the King's Theatre on 25 January 1765, playing a violin concerto, and started playing at Covent Garden Theatre in 1767. From about 1769 he was leader of the band at Covent Garden Theatre, and also performed violin concertos there.<br>
<br>During the 1770s he composed the music for a number of stage works performed at Covent Garden, including <span class="italic">Harlequin Jubilee</span> (1770), a pantomime, the first with all the music written by only one composer; the incidental music for the play <span class="italic">Zobeide</span> (1771) adapted by Joseph Cradock from Voltaire's <span class="italic">Les scythes</span>; the very successful overture for Kane O'Hara's burletta <span class="italic">The Golden Pippin</span> (1773); the overture for Edward Thompson's masque <span class="italic">The Syrens</span> (1777); music for the pantomime <span class="italic">The Norwood Gypsies</span> written by James Messinck (1777); and music for the witches' scenes in the first act of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1780).<br>
<br>In the summers Fisher played in concerts at the Marylebone Gardens and other pleasure gardens, and he published collections of pleasure garden songs, including four books of Vauxhall songs. His orchestral music included six symphonies, published in 1772.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1772 Fisher married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1780), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Branston, widow of William Powell (1735&#150;1769), actor and manager of Covent Garden Theatre. They had one son, Charles Longford Fisher. Through his marriage Fisher acquired a one-sixteenth share in the theatre, and he was involved in its management in the 1770s. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 26 June 1777 and was awarded the degrees of BMus and DMus on 5 July 1777, two days after he led the orchestra in the first performance of his oratorio <span class="italic">Providence</span> at the Sheldonian Theatre.<br>
<br>After his wife's death, Fisher sold his share in the theatre and set off on a continental tour during which he performed in France, Germany, and Russia. In Berlin he published three very difficult violin concertos about 1783. In the autumn of 1783 he reached Vienna, where he met the soprano <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26589/', "Ann Selina (Nancy) Storace (1765&#150;1817)")</script>, daughter of Stephen Storace (<i>c</i>.1725&#150;<i>c</i>.1783), the Neapolitan double bass player, and sister of Stephen Storace, the composer. She was <i>prima buffa</i> at the Burgtheater, and it was for her that Mozart created the role of Susanna in <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>. Fisher wooed her by drinking innumerable cups of tea with her mother, and they were married on 29 March 1784. The marriage had lasted only a few months before Emperor Joseph II ordered Fisher to leave Vienna because of his ill treatment of his wife, which had caused a public scandal. There was one child of this marriage, a daughter, born in June 1784, who died of neglect after a few weeks. Although the marriage was never annulled, Nancy Storace reverted to her maiden name after his departure.<br>
<br>Fisher returned to England and moved to Ireland, where he taught the violin and played in concerts at the Rotunda in Dublin. With William Heron he directed a series of six subscription concerts at the Rotunda in 1790. In his final years Fisher taught music to the family of Owen Wynne of Hazelwood, near Sligo, and he died in Wynne's house in June 1806.<br>
