<span class="headword">Bracegirdle,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1614), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, whose place and date of birth are unknown, matriculated as a sizar at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1588 and proceeded BD in 1602. Previous accounts of his life state that he was the son of John Bracegirdle or Bretchgirdle (<i>d</i>. 1565), vicar of Holy Trinity, Stratford upon Avon, and that he was born in Cheshire, but this seems unlikely as this Bracegirdle's will mentions neither marriage nor children. Bracegirdle was ordained priest in Lincoln by Bishop William Chaderton on 14 May 1598, after which followed a series of clerical appointments in Sussex: as rector of St John's-sub-Castro, Lewes, on 21 November 1598, which he held until 1602; rector of St Thomas-in-the-Cliffe in 1599; vicar of Rye on 12 July 1602; vicar of West Firle on 29 January 1602; and finally vicar of Peasmarsh on 31 July 1606.<br>
<br>Bracegirdle's only known work is in manuscript: &#145;Psychopharmacon, the mindes medicine, or, The phisicke of philosophie&#146;, in five books and dated 1602; it survives as BL, Add. MS 11401. This is a translation into English of Boethius with the prose translated into blank verse, and the verse into different forms of rhyme; it is dedicated to Thomas Sackville, later earl of Dorset, who as Lord Buckhurst presented him with the vicarage of Rye. This may indicate that Bracegirdle had puritan leanings which Sackville wished to promote; east Sussex was notorious for puritanism from the 1570s onwards and Rye reportedly had a puritan mayor in 1610. The gentry were known to encourage educated ministers who could preach well and Bracegirdle was licenced to preach throughout the diocese on 29 January 1604.<br>
<br>Bracegirdle was married to Sarah Blaxton (1580&#150;1639), one of nine children of Henry Blaxton (<i>d</i>. 1606), chancellor of Chichester Cathedral, and his wife, Joan Nunn (<i>d</i>. 1607). Bracegirdle and his wife had at least one son, also called John, who was baptized in 1607 in Rye, and possibly one daughter, Rebecca.<br>
<br>Bracegirdle's &#145;Psychopharmacon&#146; included a promise to produce further work but any other literary intentions he may have had were terminated with his death in early 1614, and he was buried on 8 February at St Mary's Church, Rye. As his will is missing it is not known how his finances stood; the plurality of his livings might suggest he was seeking to supplement a low income but the more learned clergy frequently held several offices. In 1614 his wife married another clergyman, William Stonard (<i>c</i>.1571&#150;1637), parson of Ashurst, Sussex.<br>
