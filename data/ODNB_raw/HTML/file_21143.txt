<span class="headword">Pakington, Sir  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1477, <em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of John Pakington and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Washbourne of Stanford-on-Teme, Worcestershire. He began his professional career as an attorney of the common pleas, appearing for a Shropshire client in 1498, and acting as deputy for the sheriff of that county in 1500; his signature is also found on a bill in chancery as early as 1500. This may explain how he came to be chirographer of the common pleas in 1508, a valuable clerical office which he held until his death, though since the office was in the gift of the crown Pakington must have acquired a significant patron. Shortly before 1505 he became a member of the Inner Temple, but he did not immediately abandon attorneyship and in 1506 represented the inn itself in a debt action. In 1512 he was appointed solicitor to the Mercers' Company. However, by 1507 he was described as &#145;counsel&#146; in the court of requests, in 1513 he became a justice of the peace for Gloucestershire, and in 1515 member of parliament for the same shire, while in 1517 he was sufficiently advanced at the bar to become a bencher of his inn without having read.<br>
<br>In 1519 Pakington is mentioned as &#145;legis peritus de consilio&#146; in a case in the London Guildhall  (TNA: PRO, CP 40/1026, m. 101d). He delivered readings in the Inner Temple in 1520 and 1528, serving as treasurer from 1528 to 1533. Some new chambers erected in the inn at this time, doubtless at his expense, were named Pakington's Rents. In 1529 he received a very remarkable patent allowing him to wear a hat in the king's presence (and on all other occasions), and exempting him from being made a knight, a baron of the exchequer, or a serjeant-at-law. Perhaps a call of serjeants was already in the offing. Pakington was indeed offered the coif in 1531, but, presumably relying on his privilege, was never created. The reason may have been that his principal activities were keeping him away from London.<br>
<br>By his marriage in the 1520s to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1563), daughter of Henry Dacres, sheriff of London, and widow of Robert Fairthwaite (<i>d</i>. 1521), Pakington acquired valuable city connections; but most of his land purchases were in his native county of Worcestershire, where in 1528 he settled at Hampton Lovett. He was a steward of estates in Worcestershire for Worcester Cathedral and Fotheringhay College; and he was active in the council in the marches in the 1530s, becoming a justice for north Wales (1532), recorder of Worcester (by 1539, when he was elected member for the shire), a Welsh judge on the Brecon circuit (1541), and recorder of Ludlow (1542). Waiving his patent of 1529, he accepted knighthood in 1545. He died on 21 August 1551 and was buried at Hampton Lovett, where there is a tomb chest. His sons having predeceased him, his daughters Bridget Littleton and Ursula Scudamore were his heirs-at-law, and his entailed estates passed to his nephew Thomas Pakington. Among various charitable bequests he left money for the marriage of between forty and sixty poor maidens, for making highways and bridges around Hampton Lovett, and for the poor-boxes of the Inner Temple and various parishes. The household servants remembered in his will included two minstrels. Dame Anne founded almshouses in Fleet Street and a charity for the poor of St Botolph, Aldersgate.<br>
