<span class="headword">Swinhoe,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1658&#150;1671), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the son of Gilbert Swinhoe (<i>c</i>.1594&#150;1644&times;51) of Chatton, co. Durham, high sheriff of Northumberland in 1642, and Dorothy Guevara, daughter of Robert Clavering and Mary Collingwood who, after her husband's death in 1600, married Sir Henry Guevara. Swinhoe's parents married about 1620.<br>
<br>By the seventeenth century the Swinhoes had become a large family scattered throughout Northumberland and co. Durham; the several different branches, and several sons with the same forename, make confident identification difficult. What is known is that the surname derives from Swinhoe, a manor in the parish of Bamburgh. Swinhoe himself was a member of the Goswick branch (a cadet branch of the Rock side of the family), some of whom moved to Chatton. The manor of Chatton was part of the Percy estates; Swinhoe may have acted as bailiff to the earls of Northumberland in 1656. His immediate family was royalist. His younger brother, James, served as a lieutenant-colonel in 1643 and their father, charged with having raised the <i>posse comitatus</i> against parliament, was excluded from employment by a resolution of the House of Commons passed on 3 October 1644; in September of the following year, moreover, Gilbert senior was taken prisoner, shipped to London, and committed to the Tower, where it is likely that he died (by July 1651 his wife is described as a widow).<br>
<br>Much of what is known of Swinhoe's life has been adduced from the life&#151;and death&#151;of his brother James. That Gilbert Swinhoe of Chatton was the author of <span class="italic">The Tragedy of the Unhappy Fair Irene</span> (1658) has been inferred from the three commendatory verses written by his kinsmen which accompany the text of the play; the first of them, &#145;To his Dear Brother the Author&#146;, is subscribed &#145;Ja. Swinhoe&#146;  (sig. A1<i>r</i>). Each in its way emphasizes the youth of the playwright. The play itself is the first extant English drama to treat of Mahomet the Great's violently passionate, fatal love for Irene, a Greek woman of incomparable beauty, a tale which had first appeared in print in Bandello's novella (1554), which was rendered into English by William Painter (1566). Swinhoe is likely to have read the tale, however, in Richard Knolles's <span class="italic">The Generall Historie of the Turkes</span> (1603, 350&#150;53). An uneven and haphazardly versified rendering, his play does not seem to have been performed publicly. His brother's intervention in a later incident helps to identify the protagonist as Gilbert Swinhoe the playwright. In February 1671 at Chillingham, a small village near Chatton, Swinhoe was provoked into striking Andrew Carr, who continued to exchange &#145;very hye and provoking words&#146; with James Swinhoe for the rest of the evening  (Raine, ed., <span class="italic">Depositions</span>, 188); the inference is that the company had been drinking for some time. After retiring, Carr sent Gilbert Swinhoe a note challenging him to a duel, but early the following morning Carr and James Swinhoe were found at swords drawn. They were parted. Later that afternoon they fought again, and James Swinhoe was wounded in the arm, from which injury he bled to death. Carr was tried for manslaughter.<br>
<br>Raine states that Swinhoe married Susanna Rookebye (<i>bap</i>. 1637), the daughter of Francis Rookebye of Mortham, Yorkshire. In 1663 he settled at Crookhouse, a property high above Bowment Water which had been in the family for a century. It is not known when Swinhoe died.<br>
