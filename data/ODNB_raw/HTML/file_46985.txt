<span class="headword">Ewart, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1817&#150;1889), <span class="occ">linen manufacturer, politician, and philanthropist</span>, was born on 11 November 1817 in Sydenham, on the outskirts of Belfast, the eldest son of William Ewart (1789&#150;1873) and Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rosen. He was educated at the Belfast Royal Academy, and was then employed in his grandfather's firm of William Ewart &amp; Son, becoming a partner in 1843. In 1840 he married Isabella Kelso, daughter of Lavens Mathewson of Newtownstewart, co. Tyrone. They had nine sons and five daughters, of whom nine children survived him. As a partner he was the dominant influence in the business and a powerful figure in the linen industry generally, so much so that when he died, the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> described him, with a touch of hyperbole, as the &#145;father of our staple trade in Belfast&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>, 5 Aug 1889).<br>
<br>Ewart's grandfather, also William Ewart (1759&#150;1851), had moved to Ballymacarret, close to Belfast, from Hillsborough, co. Down, about 1790, and became involved in the newly developing cotton industry. In 1814 he formed a partnership with his eldest son, Ewart's father. About 1840 the firm diversified into flax spinning, thus following a trend initiated by Andrew Mulholland a decade earlier and taken up by an increasing number of Belfast cotton producers, who exploited the comparative advantages that wet flax-spinning techniques offered. The Ewarts were unusual only in that they had been manufacturers of cloth rather than spinners.<br>
<br>The Ewarts' first mill, powered by water, was on the Crumlin Road. Power-loom weaving was added about 1850, and in 1852 they purchased the Glenbank bleaching works. In 1859 the firm moved to extensive warehouses at 11 Donegal Place, though it kept its mills on the Crumlin Road. On the eve of the American civil war and the subsequent cotton famine, the Ewarts were already in possession of a vertically integrated business and well placed to meet the increasing demand for linen. By now Ewart was in full control.<br>
<br>By good management, Ewarts survived the post-war depression and, indeed, prospered by buying up the assets of less enterprising competitors. For example, in 1876 it bought the premises of the Bedford Street Weaving Company and in the same year purchased the Mountain mill, Ligoniel, from Waring and Duncan. During the trade depression of 1883, in order to protect the family wealth, Ewart turned the business into a limited liability company, with a capital of &pound;500,000. There were six partners: Ewart himself, and five sons.<br>
<br>Part of the success of Ewarts can be attributed to tight family control both before and after the adoption of limited liability. Five of Ewart's six surviving sons entered the business. Two of them were resident in New York and attended to American sales. The reputation of the firm as an employer was mixed. According to a contemporary source, Ewart, on winning a legal case with a rival firm over water rights, was cheered by an &#145;enthusiastic crowd&#146; all the way from the court house to his office. After he acquired the Mountain mill he built 500 dwelling houses at Ligoniel for his employees. On the other hand, in 1870 the firm was fined &pound;13 10<i>s</i>. for employing labour between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. in breach of the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>, and had repeatedly been reported for serious infringements in its spinning mills. When Ewart died, the firm had between 5000 and 6000 employees and an annual wage bill of &pound;150,000. It operated 33,500 spindles and 2000 power looms.<br>
<br>In common with many other Belfast manufacturers during the nineteenth century, Ewart played an active part in the political, philanthropic, and religious life of the city. He was a member of the Belfast corporation for twenty-five years and mayor in 1859 and 1860. He was elected for Belfast City as a Conservative at a by-election in 1878; he held the seat in 1880. In 1885 he moved to North Belfast as a result of boundary changes. He was created a baronet in 1887. He was a justice of the peace for Belfast, Antrim, and Down, served on the boards of several charitable institutions, as well as trade bodies such as the Flax Supply Association, the Linen Merchants' Association, and the Belfast chamber of commerce.<br>
<br>Ewart was a staunch member of the Church of Ireland and was a member of the representative board set up in 1869 after disestablishment. In this role he was active in putting the financial affairs of the church on a sound footing. According to his obituary, &#145;there was hardly a church throughout Belfast which had not received of his liberality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>, 5 Aug 1889). He died in London at 14 Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, on 1 August 1889 and was buried in Belfast five days later. News of his death arrived in Belfast on a Saturday, in time for five churches to hold memorial services on Sunday and for the encomiums to be reported at length in the press the following morning. He opposed, however, the building of a cathedral in Belfast, arguing that it would detract from the erection of parish churches required by a growing population. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Quartus Ewart (1844&#150;1919).<br>
