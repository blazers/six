<span class="headword">Brockhurst,  Gerald Leslie</span>  (1890&#150;1978), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born on 31 October 1890 at 106 Summer Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, and registered as the fourth son of Arthur Brockhurst, a coal merchant, and his wife, Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward. The various mythologies surrounding his early life established a pattern of lifelong ambiguities and energetic self-promotion. By 1901 he was registered at the Birmingham School of Art, where his precocious talent won him a place at the Royal Academy Schools, which he entered in 1907. Here, among other awards, he won the gold medal and travelling scholarship, the latter enabling him to visit Paris and Italy where he studied the art of the fifteenth-century Italian painters and more specifically the work of Piero della Francesca, Botticelli, and Leonardo da Vinci. Their influence was to be central to the evolution of his own artistic development. On 5 December 1911, in Chelsea, he married his first wife, Ana&iuml;s, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Folin, a Frenchwoman whose distinctive features provided the inspiration for many of his early portraits (such as <span class="italic">Ranunculus</span>, 1914, Sheffield City Art Galleries); described on their marriage certificate as an artist and painter, she was the daughter of Jean Folin, timber merchant. From 1915 to 1919 Brockhurst and Ana&iuml;s lived in Ireland, where they were introduced by Oliver St John Gogarty to Augustus John and his circle. In 1919 the first significant exhibition of Brockhurst's work was held at the Chenil Galleries in London, where he returned to live in that year. Contemporary reviews of the exhibition spoke of his art as giving &#145;an edge to forms which vision does not experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vogue</span>, 15 April 1919). This &#145;edge&#146; was to characterize the best of all his subsequent work.<br>
<br>It was during the 1920s and 1930s that Brockhurst established himself first as a printmaker of outstanding virtuosity and second as one of the most original and successful portrait painters of his generation. Both printmaking and portraiture were notoriously over-subscribed in the inter-war years but, concentrating almost exclusively on female portraits and frequently using his wife as his model, he produced a large body of memorable etchings throughout the 1920s, often repeating the image in pencil and oil. An example of this process is his exceptional male portrait of Henry Rushbury (1927, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). By 1930, while still pursuing printmaking, he had turned increasingly to painting, establishing for himself a role as a portraitist of rare power and vision. Working with a new model, Kathleen Woodward (whom he met when she was sixteen, and renamed Dorette, and who later became his second wife after he and his first wife divorced in 1940), he was inspired to create some of his most highly charged images, as, for example, the etching <span class="italic">Adolescence</span> (1932) and the painting <span class="italic">Dorette</span> (1933, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston). Later sitters included the actresses Merle Oberon (exh. RA, 1937; priv. coll.) and Marlene Dietrich (exh. RA, 1939; priv. coll.) and the duchess of Windsor (1939, National Portrait Gallery, London).<br>
<br>In 1939, at the height of his career, Brockhurst moved to the United States, where he remained for the rest of his life, living first in New York city and later in New Jersey. Although he continued to paint and undertook many commissions, he never again attained that powerful combination of technical prowess and psychological intensity which characterized the etched and painted work of his earlier career. Brockhurst died on 4 May 1978 in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, where he and Dorette had made their home.<br>
