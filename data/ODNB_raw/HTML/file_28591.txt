<span class="headword">Walmsley,  Thomas</span>  (1763&#150;1805/6), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was descended from a family of good position at Rochdale, Lancashire. He is sometimes referred to as John Walmsley. He was born in Dublin, where his father, Thomas Walmsley, captain-lieutenant of the 18th dragoons, was stationed with his regiment. He quarrelled with his family, and went to London to earn his living. He studied scene-painting under Giovanni Battista Colombo at the opera-house, and was himself employed there and at Covent Garden Theatre and the King's Theatre; he also worked at Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, after it reopened in 1788. In 1790 he began to exhibit landscapes in London, where he lived until 1795, when he retired to Bath. He showed a Welsh landscape at the Incorporated Society of Arts in 1790 and sent many pictures to the Royal Academy, chiefly views in Wales; but in 1796, the last year in which he exhibited, three views of Killarney. He painted chiefly in body colour but also in oils in a small size and in watercolours. His trees were heavy and conventional, and he had no capacity for drawing figures, but he was skilful in painting skies, especially with a warm evening glow, which was well reproduced in the coloured aquatints by Francis Jukes and others, through which he is best known at the present day. Of these several series were published both before and after his death: <span class="italic">Views of the Dee and North Wales</span> (1792&#150;4); <span class="italic">Larger Views of North Wales</span> (1800); <span class="italic">Views of Killarney and Kenmare</span> (1800&#150;02); <span class="italic">Miscellaneous British Scenery</span> (1801); <span class="italic">Views in Bohemia</span> (1801); <span class="italic">Views of the Isle of Wight</span> (1802&#150;3); <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Irish Scenery</span> (1806); <span class="italic">Views in Scotland</span> (1810). Walmsley died at Bath either in 1805 (Edwards gives his date of death as August 1805) or in 1806. Examples of his work in gouache are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum, London.<br>
