<span class="headword">Allen, Sir  Hugh Percy</span>  (1869&#150;1946), <span class="occ">musicologist and conductor</span>, was born at Reading on 23 December 1869, the youngest of the seven children of John Herbert Allen, who was in business with Huntley and Palmers of Reading. His mother, Rebecca, was the daughter of Samuel Bevan Stevens, a member of the firm of Huntley, Bourne, and Stevens, which made the tins for biscuits manufactured by Huntley and Palmers.<br>
<br>There is not much evidence that music was seriously cultivated in the home, nor that any particular success was achieved by the boy at Kendrick School, Reading, but the arrival of Dr Frederick John Read as organist of Christ Church, Reading, when Allen was eight, was a milestone in his life. Determined to have lessons from Read, Allen played the organ at local churches&#151;Coley (1880), Tilehurst (1884), Eversley (1886)&#151;and in 1887 he combined his post at the last of these with some teaching at Wellington College. In that year he went as assistant to Read, who had been appointed organist of Chichester Cathedral. This provided valuable experience in cathedral services, the training of a choir, and the responsibilities of a cathedral organist. As yet, however, he had no paper qualifications. He therefore took his BMus examinations at Oxford in 1892, and in the same year was appointed organ scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge. Here appeared the first signs of his power to influence others musically when he gave performances of Bach cantatas in the college chapel. The college music society, the college orchestra, the university musical club, performances of Greek plays: all these gained by his infectious enthusiasm and his drive. He graduated in 1895 and in 1896 took his DMus examinations at Oxford, although he was prevented by regulations from taking the degree until 1898.<br>
<br>In 1897 Allen was appointed organist of St Asaph Cathedral, and in his one year there he vastly improved the standard of singing and radically altered the repertory. The next year he went to Ely Cathedral, where he forged musical links with Cambridge. While there he conducted notable performances of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> and Brahms's <span class="roman">Requiem</span> and <span class="italic">Schicksalslied</span>. In 1902 Allen married Edith Winifred, daughter of Oliver Hall, of Dedham, Essex; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1901 Allen was appointed organist of New College, Oxford. Like those at St Asaph and Ely, the choir at New College was soon required to sing much difficult music, and the weekly service lists show both progressiveness and catholicity. In 1908 the college showed its appreciation of Allen's work by offering him a fellowship. But research was not his m&eacute;tier, and he soon resigned the fellowship. More importantly, it was at this time that he was responsible for amalgamating two choral societies (of different traditions and understandable rivalry) into the Oxford Bach Choir, which developed a great reputation; and he formed an orchestra to accompany it. Both choir and orchestra became important in both the university and the city. Appointed choragus to the university in 1909, he began to introduce a new scheme of practical training for Oxford's music students.<br>
<br>Such was Allen's reputation that he was frequently approached by musical authorities outside Oxford. He became director of the Petersfield Festival (1906), conductor of the London Bach Choir (1907&#150;20), director of music at University College, Reading (1908&#150;18), and director of music at Cheltenham Ladies' College (1910&#150;18). In 1913, 1922, 1925, and 1928 he conducted at the Leeds Festival. In 1918 Sir Walter Parratt resigned the professorship of music at Oxford, and there was no doubt about the identity of his successor. Oxford was glad to have at last a resident professor. But when Sir Hubert Parry died later in the year Allen was appointed director of the Royal College of Music in London, and Oxford thought it would lose him. As usual with Allen, nothing of the sort occurred. He retained his professorship, kept his rooms at New College, and for another seven years conducted the Oxford Bach Choir. However, he undertook practically no other performing engagements.<br>
<br>Allen's arrival at the Royal College of Music coincided with post-war expansion. The number of students rose from 200 to 600, and many of the director's plans for extension of work, which were made quickly and, as it seemed, temporarily, eventually became permanent. For nineteen years he directed the affairs of the college, but in 1937 he felt he ought to retire. Retirement with Allen meant a change of occupation; to the end of his life he retained his Oxford professorship and made Oxford his headquarters. He continued to press for the creation of a music faculty, which the university granted in 1944. New premises and the setting up of a music school occupied him continuously from this time until his death.<br>
<br>In Oxford, Allen galvanized generations of undergraduates into musical action. He was criticized for being content with less than perfect performances, but his critics, while having a modicum of truth on their side, failed to perceive his aim. In Allen's mind, rehearsals (where he could talk and teach) were more important than performances.<br>
<br>In addition, his advice and help were sought by many musical organizations. The Incorporated Society of Musicians owes its reconstitution and its revivification chiefly to him; Kneller Hall sought his help; he was a member of the council of the corporation of the Royal Albert Hall; the Royal Philharmonic Society needed, and got, his advice; the British Broadcasting Corporation made him chairman of its music advisory committee in 1936. There was a time, just before he retired from the Royal College of Music, when it could be safely said that there were few musical happenings in the country about which Allen had not been consulted.<br>
<br>Although a gifted conductor, Allen undoubtedly &#145;owed his position less to his musical than to his organizing abilities, and to sheer energy and driving force&#146;  (Colles and Turner, 281). He received many honours, being knighted in 1920, appointed CVO in 1926, and promoted KCVO in 1928 and GCVO in 1935. Besides receiving his Oxford doctorate he was made an honorary MusD of Cambridge (1925), DLitt of Reading (1938), LittD of Sheffield (1926), and DPhil of Berlin. He was also an honorary fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge (1926); and in 1937 he was master of the Worshipful Company of Musicians.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1946 Allen was knocked down by a motorcyclist in Oxford, and the severe injuries which he received caused his death three days later on 20 February in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.<br>
