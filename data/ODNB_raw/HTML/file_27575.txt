<span class="headword">Touchet,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Anselm]</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1689?), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born at Stalbridge, Dorset, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66794/', "Mervin Touchet, twelfth Baron Audley and second earl of Castlehaven (1593&#150;1631)")</script>, who was convicted and executed for rape and sodomy in 1631, and his first wife, Elizabeth Barnham (1592&#150;1622x4). He made his monastic profession at the English Benedictine priory of St Gregory, Douai, on 22 November 1643, taking the name Anselm in religion. He worked on the English mission and may have taught, from 1657, at the College of St Vedast in Douai. However, it is possible that he remained in England, as he became chaplain to Queen Catherine of Braganza with rooms at Somerset House and a stipend of &pound;100 a year; he was performing weddings at St James's from 1662 until 1672 and at Somerset House during 1674&#150;5. In 1675 Touchet was banished, and in 1678 he was expressly excluded by an act of parliament from the succession to the earldom of Castlehaven, which passed to his brother Mervyn, in 1684. In 1682 Touchet wrote a letter to the Brussels nuncio concerning the oath of allegiance, but was &#145;never employed in official [monastic] life and appears to have died before the Chapter of 1689&#146;  (Athanasius, 1999, 103).<br>
<br>Touchet was the author of a work of Catholic controversy, <span class="italic">Historical collections out of several grave protestant historians concerning the changes of religion and the strange confusions following from thence</span>, first published (without a place of publication) in 1674; an amended edition appeared in London in 1684. Such historical work was typical of the Benedictine approach of the time: an assertion that England could be saved from perdition not so much by theology as by an exploration of historical continuity and by a demonstration of Catholic authority. In this Touchet was in the company of Hugh Serenus Cressy, James Maurus Corker, and John Dryden's <span class="italic">Defence</span> of the duchess of York's conversion. A copy of a manuscript of Touchet's, a translation of the work of the Capuchin Constantine Pauret de Barbanson (1581&#150;1632), was published in an abridged form in 1928 as <span class="italic">The Secret Paths of Divine Love</span>. Touchet's spiritual writing associates him closely with the tradition of the English Benedictine mystic, Augustine Baker.<br>
