<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray,  William Staite</span>  (1881&#150;1962), <span class="occ">potter and teacher of pottery</span>, was born on 9 September 1881 at 103 High Street, Deptford, London, the third son of the six children of James Murray, merchant, and his wife, Arabella, daughter of Abel Staite, cheesemonger, of London. From an early age he showed an aptitude for drawing, and after short periods at Haberdashers' Aske's School in New Cross and possibly at nearby Colfe's School, he was sent around the age of twelve to cousins who were professional artists. This stay lasted for two years until his father, a strict Calvinist of Scottish descent, decided that the life of an artist held little prospects, and in 1895 he arranged employment witBlokkers, a firm of bulb and seed merchants at Akersloot in North Holland. Although far removed from the life of an artist, Murray gained a useful knowledge of botany, made a small collection of Delft and Nankin pottery, then a fashionable interest, and travelled widely, visiting Belgium, Germany, and France, where he studied painting.<br>
<br>In the Netherlands, Murray was introduced to theosophy, a religious movement based on Buddhist and Hindu mysticism founded by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in the United States some twenty years earlier. Very different from his own religious background, the sect offered Murray a meaningful structure for his own ideas. Later he was to become a committed Buddhist. About 1900 Murray was sent to the USA and Canada, probably to further his knowledge of horticulture, though nothing is known of his experiences there.<br>
<br>Back in London, Murray's father made him manager of Blokker and Murray, bulb and seed merchants in New Cross, though the business was not a success. Through family connections he became friendly with Kathleen Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1952), daughter of Richard Medhurst, a ship and chandlery business owner, who shared his love of painting. They married on 6 June 1905, setting up home at 111 Tyrwhitt Road, Lewisham, Kent. Keen to develop his artistic interests Murray attended evening pottery classes at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts where its principal, William Dalton, himself an enthusiastic potter, had initiated a course. Murray also continued to paint and even tried bronze casting. Perhaps inspired by the 1910 exhibition of Song and Yuan dynasty Chinese pottery and porcelain at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in Savile Row, Murray was inspired to develop further his potting skills. In sharp contrast to the accepted court porcelains of the Ming dynasty the Song pots highlighted integration of form with glaze and decoration. The exhibition stimulated other artist potters, notably Reginald Wells and George Cox.<br>
<br>For a time Murray became closely associated with the painter Cuthbert Hamilton, who was a friend of Wyndham Lewis, founder of the Vorticists, and he became part of a loose-knit group of radical painters, sculptors, and poets. Potting took up more and more of Murray's time, and a street directory of 1916 lists him as &#145;artist potter&#146;. At this time he had a pottery at 18 Yeoman's Row, off Brompton Road, shared with Cuthbert Hamilton, where they made earthenware with painted decoration. Many of his designs carried out on shallow bowls espoused abstract Vorticist principles, often in asymmetrical compositions. The First World War curtailed production when from 1915 to 1918 Murray served in the machine-gun corps at Grantham.<br>
<br>Following the end of the war Murray found a new direction in his work by setting up his own workshop in 1919 at his brothers' foundry in Rotherhithe, building a high-temperature gas-fired kiln with the aim of producing high-fired stoneware inspired by Song dynasty wares. A fascinating link with the work of the pioneering Martin brothers, makers of individual salt-glaze wares, took place when Murray visited Robert Wallace Martin, the last surviving brother. This was possibly to seek advice on high-temperature firing, as little technical information was generally available.<br>
<br>Murray was also encouraged by the work of Bernard Leach, who in 1920 returned from Japan with the potter Hamada Shoji and set up a workshop in St Ives producing among other wares high-fired stonewares, and unlike Murray had the advantage of having spent time in Japan and China. Murray and Leach met in 1921 at an exhibition of the latter's work in London. A friendship was struck, and Murray visited St Ives, learned to throw on a Japanese wheel that was pushed round with a stick, and from Hamada learned much about high-temperature glazes and oriental brushwork. To improve the firing Murray experimented with a two-chamber oil-fired kiln, claiming in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to &#145;have successfully used crude oil for burning pottery since 1923&#146;, a system which allowed a great measure of control  (22 Sept 1926). The design was patented in 1926.<br>
<br>From this time Murray worked only in stoneware, producing wheel-thrown bowls and magnificent bottles, many with brush decoration. In 1920 he moved to Wickham Road, Brockley, near Lewisham, where he worked with his only assistant, whom he named Molly as he did not like her forename. By 1924 Murray had made sufficient technical advances to produce convincing pieces in a Song-like style, and had begun to develop an individual style, with full-bodied forms often covered with such classic glazes as &#145;temmoku&#146;, &#145;hare's fur&#146;, and &#145;chun&#146;. Patronage from such important collectors as George Eumorfopoulos and later Eric Milner-White, dean of York, helped to establish his reputation. His pots were shown at typical craft events such as the Red Rose Guild annual exhibition in Manchester, as well as in galleries usually devoted to fine art. In 1929 he moved to Court Cottage, Bray, Berkshire, taking Molly with him.<br>
<br>In 1925 Murray was appointed head of pottery at the Royal College of Art, London, in preference to Bernard Leach, a position he held until 1939. He was tall and thin, and an influential teacher, though by his own and his students' accounts he did little actual instructing, preferring instead to &#145;create an atmosphere&#146; in which students could develop. Notable students include R. W. Washington, Sam Haile, and Henry Hammond, who later became head of the ceramics department at Farnham School of Art. As a member of the radical <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96398', "Seven & Five Society")</script> and with artists including Barbara Hepworth and Ben and Winifred Nicholson, Murray showed his pots alongside paintings and sculpture, and could and did place substantial sums on his pieces. Some were left with little decoration, the thrown vessels relying on the strong form and rich glaze for their impact. Others were highly decorated with painted and incised decoration that often covered the whole piece. The finest were given titles such as <span class="italic">Persian Garden</span> and to emphasize the abstract quality of the work <span class="italic">Serenity</span>, <span class="italic">Cadence</span>, and <span class="italic">Aulos</span>.<br>
<br>In 1939 Murray and his wife went to Rhodesia to visit relatives, and frustrated in their attempts to return by the Second World War they eventually settled at Odzi, near Umtali, Rhodesia. Although intending to return to England, news of rationing and austerity kept them in Rhodesia and Murray never made another pot. Kathleen died on 25 July 1952, the same day on which Murray received a letter of greeting from the International Conference of Potters and Weavers at Dartington Hall, Devon. Much of his time was devoted to forming a Buddhist Society in Umtali. Diagnosis of cancer encouraged him to make a brief visit to England where he took the opportunity to burn virtually all his papers and hold a farewell exhibition in November 1958 at the Leicester Galleries, London. He returned to Rhodesia in December, where he died of cancer at the general hospital, Umtali, on 7 February 1962.<br>
<br>With Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray was one of the towering figures of the art and craft world in the 1920s and 1930s. As a near contemporary of Leach (Murray was six years older) they had a great deal in common in a shared interest in oriental aesthetics, in Far Eastern religions, and in high-fired stoneware ceramics, but after an initial friendship fundamental differences in approach to the role of craft in the modern world kept them apart. Murray regarded himself as an artist making art objects with no use other than to be beautiful, and did not share Leach's interest in the Arts and Crafts movement or his belief that craft could play a social role. Following a decline in his reputation as a major twentieth-century artist potter, a major retrospective in 1984 firmly established his strength as both potter and artist. His insistence that his work be seen as art is a debate that continues to engage artist&#150;makers. Examples of his work are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Milner-White Collection at York City Art Gallery and Southampton Art Gallery, and the Crafts Study Centre at the West Surrey School of Art, Farnham.<br>
