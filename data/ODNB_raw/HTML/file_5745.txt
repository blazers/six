<span class="headword">Cobham,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1265&#150;1327), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was the sixth son of John Cobham (<i>d</i>. 1300), of Cobham and Cooling, Kent, and his wife, daughter of Sir Robert Septvans [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52781/', "Cobham family")</script>]. His early career is obscure, but from 1284 he was retained by the Canterbury chapter with a pension of 5 marks. The Pauline annalist wrote that he was regent in three universities: in arts at Paris (where an elder brother James also studied), in canon law at Oxford (regent in 1291), and in theology at Cambridge (DTh by 1314). Details of his ordination have yet to be traced&#151;he was still a subdeacon in 1317&#151;but Archbishop Pecham collated him in 1288 to his first benefice, Hollingbourne in Kent. He soon became a substantial pluralist. In 1306 he was dispensed to hold a benefice additional to his rectories of Hollingbourne, Boxley, Hackney, and Rotherfield, and his canonries of St Paul's London, Hereford, and Wells. He acquired the archdeaconry of Lewes <i>in commendam</i> by 1301, and secured the precentorship of York in 1312.<br>
<br>In the meantime Cobham had become a king's clerk, and more especially a diplomat, an expert versed in the intricacies of Gascon and French affairs. He was sent by Edward I to the papal curia in 1305&#150;6, while following Edward II's accession he was deputed in December 1309 to examine the terms of the truce with France and on that account summoned to parliament the following February. Then in November 1310 he was appointed to join other envoys in Gascony, where he remained until the spring of 1311. In April he was one of the lawyers directed to examine articles concerning Guyenne (Gascony) and to report to the king's council. On 20 May he was instructed to travel to Paris and later associated with Gilbert Peche in assessing merchants' losses from breaches of the truce for consideration by the French king's arbitrators at Montreuil. February 1312 saw him with other councillors at York. He left London for France on 10 April, to return on 4 June. His mission was to excuse Edward II before his overlord, Philippe IV, from responding to a summons to enforce a citation of the count of Flanders. During the autumn he was given the task of preparing the English case <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Guyenne so that response could be made in the <i>parlement</i> of Paris concerning the negotiations conducted at P&eacute;rigueux in the previous year. He was in Paris in February 1313 as king's proctor with authority to deal with Gascon affairs.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1313 Archbishop Winchelsey died and on the 28th the Canterbury monks assembled to elect a successor. Proceeding by way of compromise, they chose Cobham&#151;termed a local man born in Canterbury province&#151;who was then with Edward II in Paris. The elect accepted on 8 June; the king prevaricated. When a delegation of monks and the elect reached the curia they found that Clement V had reserved the see on 27 April. Bulls of 1 October 1313 provided Walter Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1327), the king's confidant. Contemporary chroniclers shrilly deplored Cobham's rejection, but some modern commentators, recalling Pecham and Winchelsey, regard the move as designed to promote harmony between church and king. By way of compensation Cobham was provided to Worcester on 31 March 1317 and consecrated at Avignon on 22 May. The temporalities were restored on 20 November, and he was enthroned in his cathedral on 28 October 1319.<br>
<br>The Canterbury election virtually terminated Cobham's diplomatic career, but with his colleagues he sought to mediate between Edward and his opponents in England. He is numbered among the nine bishops who endorsed the conciliatory Leicester agreement of June 1318, was a signatory of the treaty of Leake (9 August 1318), and a member of the standing council appointed to advise the king. After the Westminster parliament of October 1320 he reported his impressions in letters to the curia. His tone was avuncular, almost patronizing, as he recounted how the king had shown a promising&#151;clearly unusual&#151;attention to business. He was soon disillusioned by the threat of civil war&#151;<i>bellum intestinum</i>. Disorder was rampant; the very shrine of St Oswald at Worcester was desecrated. Although he was in London in July 1321 he did not take any noticeable part in the mediation of his fellow bishops between Edward and the barons. When the king sought to persuade the episcopate to attend a December convocation at St Paul's to sanction the Despensers' recall, he wrote that he could not reach London in time and that the matter would be more appropriately dealt with in parliament. In 1324 he endeavoured to intervene on behalf of those bishops whose temporalities had been confiscated, and was one of the bishops who met the nuncios at London in November to discuss peace between England and France.<br>
<br>Following Queen Isabella's landing in 1326 the now-ailing bishop travelled to London to seek medical attention, to attend a convocation for papal business, to join his fellow bishops in reconciling Edward and Isabella, to press litigation in the royal court and that of Canterbury, and to fulfil a vow of pilgrimage to the shrine of St Thomas Becket. All proved vain; the king had fled; even pilgrimage was rendered impossible by the painfulness of travel. Cobham asked Bishop Adam Orleton of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1345), with whom he seems to have been on good terms, to make his excuses to the queen and offered her the use of his houses and goods, with the hint that remedy could be found by summoning a parliament. He joined the rump of bishops that assembled fearfully at Lambeth on 26 October 1326. Illness prevented his contributing to the revolutionary changes that ensued, but one entry in his register has been dated 11 January (1327) from London.<br>
<br>As a diocesan, Cobham's performance was reasonably diligent, although political business prevented him from reaching his diocese until March 1319, two years after his provision. His protracted primary visitation was launched in November of that year. Commissaries performed most of it, but he visited many religious houses personally. It was still incomplete in 1321 when he travelled north to negotiate with Robert I of Scotland. He seldom used a suffragan for ordinations, and on the second occasion that he did so (December 1323) it was because of illness.<br>
<br>Cobham died on 27 August 1327, probably at Hartlebury, after a long and painful illness. It is fair to conclude that he did not respond to political crises in the robust manner that was expected of a man of his stature. Unlike Orleton or Stratford he was not a forceful politician, though undeniably a &#145;good clerk&#146;. During his lifetime he provided money for the building of a house for the university congregation north of St Mary's Church in Oxford, but it was incomplete at his death. It should have received his library, but in the event, to defray their expenses, his executors sold his books to Adam Brome, the provost of Oriel College. He bequeathed plate and vestments to his cathedral, where he was buried.<br>
