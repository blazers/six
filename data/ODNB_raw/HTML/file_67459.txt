<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Margaret Paul]</span>  (1582<span class="mult">x</span>5&#150;1654), <span class="occ">abbess</span>, was the second daughter of Sir Francis Radcliffe (1563&#150;1622) of Dilston, Northumberland, and Derwentwater, Cumberland, and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir Ralph Grey of Chillingham, Northumberland. She was the first of Sir Francis's four daughters to enter the English Poor Clare convent at Gravelines in the Spanish Netherlands, making her religious profession on 3 July 1612 aged, according to one source, twenty-seven, and taking the name Margaret Paul. Her sister Elizabeth was professed in 1617, with Dorothy and Ann taking their vows in 1619.<br>
<br>In 1622 Margaret was sent to assist as abbess at a newly established English cloister in Brussels, accompanied by her sister Elizabeth as her deputy, the vicaress. During this secondment Margaret presided over the profession of twenty-three nuns and oversaw the implementation of the monastery's governmental and spiritual structures. The Brussels convent followed a different, and less rigorous, Franciscan rule (that of the third order of St Francis) to her own Poor Clare training. Margaret nevertheless established a strict observance of the religious life there, which she later worried might have proven &#145;more strickt then your Rule and constitutions doe require&#146;  (Franciscan MS 16, fol. 5). However, the Brussels nuns were so successfully grounded in their order's traditions that within four years it was deemed possible for one of them to assume sole governance, and Margaret and Elizabeth returned to Gravelines. The esteem with which the Radcliffe sisters were held by the Franciscan nuns can be seen in continued correspondence between Margaret and her former charges when years later she was asked for advice about the duties of the vicaress. Moreover, the English translation of the life of Franciscan visionary Joan of the Cross was dedicated to them in 1625 by Francis Bell, the convent's confessor.<br>
<br>Margaret's return to Gravelines in September 1626 was mired in controversy. Abbess Elizabeth (Sister Clare Mary Ann) Tyldesley was deposed by a Franciscan official who appointed Margaret in her place, causing considerable dissension. A week later part of the convent burnt to the ground in a devastating fire, attributed by the traumatized nuns to divine providence. An inquiry into the monastery's troubles reinstated the former abbess, and in January 1627 Margaret Radcliffe and her supporters were sent to a Poor Clare house in Dunkirk. However, the fracas at Gravelines continued until 1629 when twenty-four nuns, novices, and lay sisters, including those who had gone to Dunkirk, founded a separate cloister at Aire in Artois, with Margaret as abbess. As in many other English convents the Gravelines conflict was about clerical jurisdiction, with a minority favouring the continuing control of the English Franciscan fathers and the majority desiring to be placed under the authority of the bishop, which would allow greater spiritual diversity, namely access to Jesuit confessors. Margaret apparently led the pro-Franciscan faction. Significantly her sisters all joined the Aire filiation, suggesting a family adherence to the order, although subsequent generations joined Benedictine and Augustinian cloisters.<br>
<br>Margaret Radcliffe was abbess at Aire for seven years. She died there on 26 July or in August 1654 aged seventy-one according to two sources, and was buried there. Her modest obituary noted that she had governed with &#145;prudence, charitye, and Regular observance [of the Poor Clare rule]&#146;  (MS Aire Register). Significantly a notice of her death at Gravelines did not mention her former positions of authority, rather commending her for &#145;the well Spending of her time, and in gitting of humble work&#146;  (&#145;Registers&#146;, 40). Margaret Radcliffe is typical of the many post-Reformation English abbesses who achieved the respect of their contemporaries but whose achievements have been lost in the public memory as a consequence of strict monastic enclosure, their geographic isolation from England, and their gender.<br>
