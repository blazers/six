<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armstrong,  William</span>, Baron Armstrong of Sanderstead  (1915&#150;1980), <span class="occ">civil servant and banker</span>, was born in the Salvation Mothers' Home, Mare Street, Clapton, London, on 3 March 1915, the elder son of William Armstrong, of Stirling, and his wife, Priscilla Hopkins. Both his parents were Salvation Army officers, his father having previously been an apprentice blacksmith. He was brought up in an austere and fundamentalist religious atmosphere, and his childhood involved frequent moves as his parents' postings took them around the country. He received his secondary education at Bec School in Tooting, London, from which he won an open scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied from 1934 to 1938, and obtained a double first in classics.<h2>
<a name="Treasuryhighflyer"></a>Treasury &#145;high-flyer&#146;</h2>Armstrong entered the civil service in October 1938 as an assistant principal in the Board of Education. Soon spotted as a &#145;high-flyer&#146;, by 1940 he had become assistant private secretary to the president of the Board of Education. He was then moved into the newly formed security executive, set up to deal with so-called &#145;fifth column&#146; threats. He married in 1942 Gwendoline Enid, daughter of John Bennett, a company director, of Putney; they had one son and one daughter. In 1943 he became private secretary to the secretary of the war cabinet, Sir Edward Bridges. From that time Armstrong was always near or at Whitehall's centres of power. After the war he transferred to the Treasury, being put in charge of the machinery of government branch as an assistant secretary in 1946. Then, from 1949 to 1953, he was principal private secretary to three successive chancellors of the exchequer&#151;Labour's Sir Stafford Cripps and Hugh Gaitskell, and the Conservative R. A. Butler. In this crucial post he gained invaluable experience of central economic policy making and crisis management; and playing a linkman role in the budget process, he was on five occasions responsible for the co-ordination and (to a great extent) the writing of the chancellor's budget speech.<br>
<br>Armstrong went on to hold key policy jobs in the Treasury: under-secretary in overseas finance (1953&#150;7), dealing with sterling, the balance of payments, and external financial problems, and then (1958&#150;62), as third secretary and Treasury officer of accounts, he ran the complex home finance division, concerned with government borrowing and lending, monetary policy, and the budget. He was clearly marked out for the topmost posts, but even so his appointment in 1962 as the joint permanent secretary to the Treasury, in charge of economic and financial policy, aged only forty-seven, was a dramatic and exceptionally rapid promotion in which he leap-frogged over several more senior officials. The prime minister, Harold Macmillan, seems to have been dissatisfied with the Treasury's traditional outlook and to have looked to Armstrong as a &#145;new broom&#146;. Accompanying his promotion was a radical reorganization of the Treasury&#151;based largely on a blueprint drawn up by Armstrong himself and Otto (Sir Richard) Clarke&#151;designed to make that department a modern instrument of government and better perform the functions of economic planning and management.<h2>
<a name="Permanentsecretary"></a>Permanent secretary</h2>Armstrong was permanent secretary to the Treasury from 1962 to 1968, developing a close and influential relationship with Reginald Maudling, Conservative chancellor from 1962, and Labour's James Callaghan in 1964&#150;7. Accepting the dominant Keynesian policy framework of the period, his approach as a policy adviser was analytical, logical, and undogmatic. Ministers relied heavily on his cool and objective advice and on his skills as an operator of the Whitehall machine. To civil service colleagues he could appear informal, friendly, and approachable, but always with a certain ultimate reserve. Some &#145;insiders&#146; found him enigmatic, however, and felt that underneath his calm and detached exterior there was an inner struggle, with strong, even excitable, feelings held in check. (For instance, it is known that in 1956 Armstrong, disgusted by the Suez operation, contemplated resignation but instead wore a black tie to work for some weeks as a gesture of protest against the Eden government's actions and to let off steam.)<br>
<br>Because there were more economic policy crises than triumphs during Armstrong's six years as head of the Treasury his record has come in for criticism, and some blame for failures of policy in that period has fallen to him. Critics argue that he should have stepped in to restrain Maudling in mid-1964 when the Conservatives' pre-election boom led to a major balance of payments crisis, and that he (and the Treasury) should have taken a strong pro-devaluation line when the new Labour government came into office later that year. Armstrong liked to say that the civil servant's job was to bring the politicians face to face with what he called &#145;ongoing reality&#146;. But he always played his cards close to his chest, and even close colleagues were never sure what he personally thought about policy issues or what advice he was giving to ministers in private. In May 1965 he told Callaghan that the government would be lucky to avoid devaluation, and despite the prime minister's ban on all mention of the term, he saw to it that there was some quiet contingency planning and a devaluation &#145;war book&#146; prepared. He made clear to ministers in October 1966 (a year before the exchange rate finally went) that the decision to apply for membership of the Common Market made devaluation unavoidable.<br>
<br>Armstrong deserves credit for his role in holding the Whitehall machine together during the first years of Harold Wilson's Labour government, elected in 1964, in the face of strong fissiparous pressures, including the creation of the Department of Economic Affairs under the volatile George Brown, and an influx of politically committed and sometimes prickly economic advisers (such as Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor). He did apparently see a role for a planning department and went to considerable trouble to try to make the Department of Economic Affairs experiment work, but insiders say that he was determined that the Treasury would remain the most powerful department&#151;and in reality, there was little chance of the Treasury not coming out on top in the interdepartmental struggle.<h2>
<a name="Headofthecivilservice"></a>Head of the civil service</h2>In May 1968 Armstrong took over as head of the home civil service, becoming the first permanent secretary of the newly formed Civil Service Department that November, when responsibility for managing the civil service was hived off from the Treasury. Armstrong stands out as one of the great reforming heads of the civil service in the twentieth century, making a huge contribution of leadership in the exacting years of change after the 1968 Fulton report (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1967&#150;8, 18, Cmnd 3638). He deliberately cultivated a higher public profile and made himself more available to the media than his predecessors in the job, giving interviews and taking part in discussions on television and radio, and addressing civil service unions' conferences. At the Treasury, too, he had been accessible to the press: he gave Samuel Brittan much help with his book <span class="italic">The Treasury under the Tories</span> (1964). He was, within limits, something of an &#145;open government&#146; man, believing that senior civil servants should be prepared to explain the workings of government and even join more in public debate on policy matters. He was largely responsible for the system of green papers, consultative documents, the first of which appeared in 1967.<br>
<br>Armstrong described the Fulton report as an &#145;ice-breaker&#146; or a &#145;catalyst&#146;, providing an opportunity for reform ideas to come through. His own private evidence to the committee had included ideas about reforming the structure of government and introducing executive agencies which were far-reaching and ahead of their time. While anxious to carry through what he believed were some long overdue reforms, he also felt that some of the contemporary attacks on the civil service were unfair (particularly the then fashionable allegations about mandarin &#145;amateurism&#146;) and it needed to be defended. The critics who blame civil service sabotage and obstruction in general, and Armstrong in particular, for what they interpret as the half-hearted and patchy implementation of the report's proposals after 1968 tend to exaggerate the extent to which the Fulton committee report provided a coherent and practicable programme for &#145;reform&#146;, and tend to downplay the limitations of Armstrong's freedom of movement. The vested interests of the main civil service unions were one important constraint. There was little sustained top-level political and ministerial interest. There was also weighty opposition from certain permanent secretaries to parts of Fulton. But Armstrong's achievements included the creation of the Civil Service College to boost training; improvements in personnel management, spearheaded by the Civil Service Department; the reorganization of the civil service grading structure, abolishing the old and rigid system of classes and aiming to provide better opportunities for scientists and other professionals; and encouragement given to modern management methods and techniques.<br>
<br>Since the 1940s Armstrong had been fascinated by the machinery of government, and during his time as head of the civil service political and official interest in &#145;reorganizing the machine&#146; was at its height. Armstrong backed the creation of huge merged &#145;super-ministries&#146; such as the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry. He also supported the creation of the Central Policy Review Staff in 1970, Edward Heath's &#145;think tank&#146;. Later, by the mid-1970s, politicians and top officials became much more cautious and sceptical about the benefits of structural redesign in central government.<br>
<br>William Armstrong's role in the Heath government extended far beyond his formal responsibilities as head of the civil service&#151;and in some ways beyond what was strictly proper for any civil servant. Hankering after a central role in economic policy making again, he was able to establish a close rapport with the prime minister and carve out a place as his chief adviser and confidant. This was helped by the fact that Heath distrusted the Treasury and increasingly directed the government's economic strategy from no. 10. As unemployment rose and Heath became convinced of the need for economic and industrial expansion prior to entering Europe, Armstrong was put in charge of the small group of officials who, in the winter of 1971&#150;2, worked in great secrecy on a dramatic policy &#145;U-turn&#146;, including public spending increases and preparations for what became the interventionist 1972 <span class="roman">Industry Act</span>. Then, he was one of the chief architects of the statutory incomes policy introduced at the end of 1972. He became an active participant, on behalf of the prime minister, in talks with the employers and trade unions. Armstrong and Heath resented the tag &#145;deputy prime minister&#146; which union leaders pinned on him, but the label did in a way symbolize what was happening in the government. The 1972&#150;4 period was probably the apogee of Armstrong's influence, but his role as the prime minister's right-hand man and unusual political visibility generated considerable controversy.<br>
<br>Armstrong was increasingly drawn into the political arena, and his complicity in government policy grew all the greater. He made what he later admitted to have been a bad mistake when, on 17 January 1973, he appeared sitting on the platform alongside the premier at Heath's Lancaster House presidential-style televised press conference at which was announced &#145;stage two&#146; of the government's incomes policy. As the economic and political crisis engulfing the Heath government intensified in the winter of 1973&#150;4, Armstrong urged a tough line with the striking miners and even gave advice on the highly party political matter of election timing (telling Heath that an early election would be &#145;running away from the issue&#146;). Insiders describe him as playing more of a political than a civil service role, and Armstrong himself was later to admit to misgivings, saying that he had stepped out of line and that his relationship with prime minister Heath had &#145;got slightly askew&#146;  (Hennessy, 238).<br>
<br>Armstrong was removed from the scene at the height of the crisis, in February 1974, when his health suddenly broke down. He soon recovered but decided to leave the civil service, his early retirement being announced in April 1974. This prevented any awkwardness with the incoming Labour government, for he had in effect become too closely identified with the policies and the person of Edward Heath to make the transition constitutionally expected of civil servants from working for a government of one party to serving its successor.<br>
<br>In 1974 Armstrong joined the board of the Midland Bank, and the following year he became the bank's chairman. He was no mere distinguished figurehead, but acknowledged that it was difficult for an outsider like himself, coming to a bank chairmanship late in life and without professional banking experience, to make any distinctive impact on such a major financial institution. Nevertheless he made a real contribution to boardroom policy and he was also active in meeting staff on frequent visits to the group's offices at home and overseas. In 1978 he became chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers, playing a leading role in the City campaign against the proposals of the left wing of the Labour Party to nationalize the banks.<br>
<br>Armstrong was appointed MVO in 1945, CB in 1957, KCB in 1963, and GCB in 1968. He was sworn of the privy council in 1973 and made a life peer as Baron Armstrong of Sanderstead in 1975. He was made an honorary fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1963, and Imperial College, London, in 1977. He received honorary degrees from many universities, including Oxford (1971), Sheffield (1975), City (1974), and Heriot-Watt (1975).<br>
<br>William Armstrong was one of the great public servants of the twentieth century. His rise was meteoric, but in proportion to his abilities. He deployed his considerable powers of analysis and intellect, his creative energy and inventiveness, unswervingly in the service of his political masters and what he perceived to be the public good. He was a modest and private man. At Oxford he had become an agnostic, but later reached a real and deep personal religious faith. Armstrong died suddenly in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 12 July 1980, having lived latterly at The Downs, The Warren, Ashtead, Surrey.<br>
