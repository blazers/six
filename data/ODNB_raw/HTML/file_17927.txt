<span class="headword">Mandeville,  Geoffrey  de</span>, first earl of Essex  (<em>d.</em> 1144), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son and heir of William de Mandeville, constable of the Tower of London, and Margaret, daughter of Eudo de Ryes, royal <i>dapifer</i> (&#145;steward&#146;) and lord of Colchester. According to a charter of the 1140s in favour of Geoffrey de Mandeville, his paternal grandfather, also Geoffrey, had been constable of the Tower and sheriff of Essex, London and Middlesex, and Hertfordshire. The elder Geoffrey de Mandeville was one of William I's wealthier tenants-in-chief, eleventh (and last) among Corbett's &#145;Class A&#146; Domesday landholders, with lands worth a total of &pound;740 a year concentrated in Essex, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire, and extending into seven other counties. Unlike the ten other &#145;Class A&#146; magnates, all of whom came from prominent continental families, Geoffrey and his family were of such minor importance before the conquest that their place of origin in Normandy defies certain identification. It may have been Colmesnil-Manneville (<i>arrondissement</i> Dieppe, <i>canton</i> Offranville) but it is impossible to be certain: place names such as Manneville, Magna Villa, and Magnevilla occur in France with perplexing frequency.<h2>
<a name="Lossofthefamilyestates"></a>Loss of the family estates</h2>It was during the constableship of William de Mandeville that Henry I's dangerous prisoner, Ranulf Flambard, bishop of Durham, escaped from the Tower of London early in 1101 and fled to Normandy. There Ranulf served as chief organizer of Robert Curthose's invasion of England in summer 1101 that nearly cost Henry his newly won crown. For his carelessness (or worse) William de Mandeville was burdened with an immense fine of more than &pound;2200 and was forced to relinquish his three most valuable demesne manors&#151;Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, and Walden and Great Waltham, Essex&#151;until the debt was paid in full. The Domesday value of these manors (&pound;50, &pound;50, and &pound;60 respectively) amounted to about a third of the value of the entire Mandeville demesne in England (&pound;489), and their confiscation therefore thrust the Mandeville family from the upper ranks of the English aristocracy.<br>
<br>At some time between 1103 and 1105, but probably in 1103, Henry I notified the chief men of Essex and Hertfordshire that, until such time as the debt was repaid, he had granted custody of the three Mandeville manors to his loyal follower and steward Eudo de Ryes, whose daughter Margaret was William de Mandeville's wife. Thus control of the three manors remained in the family but out of William de Mandeville's reach. At his death some time between 1105 and 1116 his son Geoffrey, probably still a minor, stood to inherit only a truncated portion of his ancestral Domesday honour. The pipe roll of 1130 discloses that Geoffrey was burdened with a substantial relief (1300 marks in 1129) for what remained of his inheritance. His chances of having the three lost manors restored to him had been much reduced by the marriage of his widowed mother, Margaret de Ryes, to the royal favourite Othuer fitz Earl, the natural son of Hugh, earl of Chester and vicomte d'Avranches, and the tutor of Henry I's only legitimate son, William &AElig;theling. Othuer appears to have come into possession of the three forfeited manors well before the death of Eudo de Ryes in February 1120, and he had also acquired William de Mandeville's former constableship of the Tower of London. Besides these Mandeville assets Othuer probably stood to inherit some or all of the cross-channel estates of his father-in-law, Eudo, thus ascending to the heights of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy while Geoffrey de Mandeville floundered. But Othuer's rise was cut short by his death, along with that of his royal pupil, in the wreck of the <i>White Ship</i> in November 1120.<br>
<br>As a result of the disaster, which severely damaged Henry I's plans for the peace of north-western Europe, the lands of Eudo de Ryes escheated to the crown and the three Mandeville manors reverted to the king. The constableship of the Tower passed to a certain Aschuill, probably Hasculf de Tanis (south-west of Avranches), who may have been a kinsman of Othuer. The shipwreck also opened prospects for Mandeville. The death of his stepfather meant that he might hope once again to recover the family fortune.<h2>
<a name="ConstableshipoftheTowerofLondon"></a>Constableship of the Tower of London</h2>Mandeville's attestations of three royal charters during Henry I's final year in Normandy suggest that he was seeking to rise through service in the king's military <i>familia</i> during Henry's campaign against Guillaume Talvas. His hopes remained unrealized at Henry I's death in December 1135 and in the initial years of Stephen's reign, when Hasculf continued to command the Tower and the three confiscated manors remained under royal control.<br>
<br>Mandeville's fortunes suddenly improved in 1139&#150;40, at a time when the spread of rebellion far and wide across the land compelled King Stephen to delegate much of his regional power to a flock of newly created earls. Between 1138 and 1141 he added no less than eighteen earldoms to the eight that had existed at the close of Henry I's reign. One of the new earls was Geoffrey de Mandeville whom Stephen appointed earl of Essex in a charter issued at Westminster probably between December 1139 and December 1140. It was at about this time, and perhaps as a result of the charter, that Mandeville recovered his ancestral right to the constableship of the Tower of London.<br>
<br>According to the late testimony of William of Newburgh, which most historians have accepted at least guardedly, King Stephen, having negotiated the betrothal of Constance, sister of Louis VII of France, to his own son Eustace, suffered humiliation at Mandeville's hands when the latter seized Constance while she and her mother-in-law, the Queen Matilda, were in London <i>c</i>.1141. Mandeville, who was then (according to Newburgh) constable of the Tower, kept Constance as his prisoner despite Matilda's urgent protests, until at length he yielded to King Stephen's demand that she be released. Newburgh believed that Stephen, although disguising his anger for the time being, never forgave Mandeville for the affront.<h2>
<a name="DefectionfromKingStephenadisputedchronology"></a>Defection from King Stephen: a disputed chronology</h2>The rise of Mandeville to the height of his power is documented by four charters&#151;two from Stephen, including the aforementioned grant of the earldom of Essex, and two from the Empress Matilda. Round dated these charters in the order of ascending benefits to Mandeville and then reached the fearlessly circular conclusion that Mandeville gained greater benefits from each successive charter:<blockquote>To determine from internal evidence the sequence of these charters, we must arrange them in ascending scale. That is to say, each charter should represent an advance on its immediate predecessor &hellip; We find each successive change of side on the part of this unscrupulous magnate marked by a distinct advance in his demands and in the price he obtained. (Round, 43, 98)</blockquote>Playing one side against the other in the most ruthless and devious fashion, so Round supposed, Mandeville was thus &#145;the most perfect and typical presentment of the feudal and anarchic spirit that stamps the reign of Stephen&#146;  (Round, v). Having obtained from Stephen's first charter (usually designated S1) the earldom of Essex, Mandeville then received from the Empress Matilda (midsummer 1141, Westminster) a recognition of his right to the earldom and to the third penny of the shire, along with a grant in fee and heredity of all the lands of his grandfather Geoffrey de Mandeville, including presumably the three lost manors (the castle of Walden is mentioned explicitly), the hereditary shrievalty and chief justiciarship of Essex, the crown manors of Maldon and Newport in that shire, and other properties (M1). Next on Round's list is King Stephen's second charter (S2), dated Christmas 1141 at Canterbury, after the king's release from imprisonment following his capture at the battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141. Stephen confirmed in this charter all that Mandeville had received from the empress in M1, along with the Essex manors of Writtle and Hatfield and certain escheated lands, worth collectively &pound;300 a year, an additional fee of sixty knights along with other lands, and the shrievalty and justiciarship of Hertfordshire and of London and Middlesex. Finally, in the empress's second charter, issued at Oxford between mid-1141 and mid-1142 (M2), Mandeville obtained in addition to the aforesaid grants (including once again all the lands held by his grandfather Geoffrey and his father, William), the lands of his grandfather Eudo de Ryes in both Normandy and England and Eudo's office of royal <i>dapifer</i>.<br>
<br>Round's ordering of these four charters was challenged in 1964 by R. H. C. Davis  (<span class="italic">EngHR</span>, 79), who accepted, more or less, Round's dating of S1, M1, and S2, but dated M2 July 1141, thus placing it before S2 and reducing Mandeville's shifts in allegiance from three to two. If Davis is correct, Mandeville defected from Stephen only after the king had been taken captive at Lincoln in February 1141 and had released his adherents from their allegiance to him. Mandeville had then returned to Stephen's cause after the empress had been driven out of London. If this chronology is correct, Mandeville had precisely followed the shifts in allegiance of Stephen's own brother, Henry, bishop of Winchester, who in fact attested M1 for the empress.<br>
<br>Davis's chronology of the four charters&#151;S1, M1, M2, S2&#151;was challenged in 1988 by J. O. Prestwich, who argued cogently for a return to Round's sequence&#151;S1, M1, S2, M2&#151;indicating three changes of allegiance rather than only two. The disagreement turns on the question of whether M2 was issued (at Oxford) in July 1141 (Davis) or between January and June 1142 (Round and Prestwich). The factors to be considered in dating this charter are complex and depend in part on whether the persons listed as &#145;hostages&#146; were or were not present. Davis's analysis of correspondences between attestors of M2 and persons attesting for the empress at Oxford in July 1141 is very persuasive. But just as persuasive are Prestwich's arguments that Geoffrey de Mandeville, far from epitomizing the &#145;feudal and anarchic spirit&#146;, was a royalist who, in the tradition of his family, sought advancement through service to the king. The freewheeling Ranulf (II), earl of Chester, whom Round regarded as a kindred spirit to Mandeville, was in fact his opposite&#151;Ranulf was a magnate who sought independence from royal authority whereas Mandeville sought royal service and royal offices.<br>
<br>In view of the royal ministries held by Mandeville's father and paternal grandfather, and by his sons, Geoffrey and William de Mandeville, <i>curiales</i> of Henry II, Mandeville, as Prestwich sees him, fits into place. He was clearly self-seeking, and Prestwich is convincing in viewing him as striving for the recovery and advancement of his fortunes and those of his family through service to the king. Significantly he married Rohese de Vere, daughter of another ambitious royal servant, Henry I's great <i>curialis</i> Aubrey de Vere, master chamberlain of England. Mandeville fought in the royal cause at the siege of Winchester in September 1141. At King Stephen's command he drove a band of rebels from the Isle of Ely early in 1142. The author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> described him at that time as:<blockquote>remarkable for the ability of his shrewd mind and to be admired for the firmness of his unbending courage in adversity and his excellence in the art of war. In the extent of his wealth and the splendour of his position he surpassed all the chief men of the kingdom &hellip; Everywhere in the kingdom he took the king's place and in all transactions was listened to more eagerly than the king and received more obedience when he gave orders. (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 161)</blockquote>His high status aroused the jealousy of other royal councillors, who persuaded the king to arrest him at the royal court at St Albans in September 1143. Stephen, who may not have forgiven him for seizing Constance of France in 1141, was sympathetic to his enemies at court. Mandeville responded to their accusations of treason with mocking contempt, but the king suddenly had him arrested and forced him to relinquish all his castles and lands. He was then released, &#145;to the ruin of the realm&#146;, said the author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>.<br>
<br>Mandeville would have regarded himself as being betrayed by Stephen, for the customs of the time prohibited a lord from arresting a <i>fidelis</i> in attendance at his court. (Stephen had similarly betrayed Roger of Salisbury and his kinsmen four years earlier in precisely the same way, and he arrested Ranulf, earl of Chester, at his court in 1146.) Earl Geoffrey hurled himself away from the royal court &#145;like a vicious and riderless horse, kicking and biting&#146;. Gathering his knights and other followers around him he took up arms against the king. He &#145;raged everywhere with fire and sword; he devoted himself with insatiable greed to the plundering of flocks and herds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 165). He sacked Cambridge, looting its churches, and pillaged the Isle of Ely. He sacked Ramsey Abbey and made it his headquarters. With the help of his brother-in-law William de Say, and eventually of Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1176/7), he dominated the fenland and terrorized East Anglia.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>In August 1144 Mandeville was fatally wounded while attacking the royal stronghold of Burwell, and he died on 26 September at Mildenhall in Suffolk. Having been excommunicated for the desecration and plundering of church property, he remained unburied for nearly twenty years until, at the instigation of his son Geoffrey, Pope Alexander III absolved him in 1163 and he was interred at the New Temple in London.<br>
<br>Although he died in rebellion, Geoffrey de Mandeville was by no means the incorrigibly turbulent baron that he was so long thought to be. He was clearly determined to make good his father's losses and advance his family's interests, but almost to the end he sought to do so in the service of the monarchy. His changes in allegiance during the anarchy were prompted in whole or in part by Stephen's capture at the battle of Lincoln, after which he was no more disloyal to the king than Stephen's own brother, Henry of Winchester.<br>
<br>Geoffrey left three known sons. The eldest, Ernulf, was illegitimate. With his wife, Rohese de Vere, he had Geoffrey (<i>d</i>. 1166) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17929/', "William de Mandeville (d. 1189)")</script>, who were successively earls of Essex and important <i>curiales</i> of Henry II. In restoring the earldom of Essex to the younger Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1156 Henry II granted him, among other things, perpetual hereditary right to Walden, Sawbridgeworth, and Great Waltham: &#145;And the lien that my grandfather King Henry had on the aforesaid three manors is quitclaimed forever&#146;  (Round, 235&#150;6, 241).<br>
