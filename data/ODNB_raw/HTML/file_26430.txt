<span class="headword">Stevenson,  George John</span>  (1818&#150;1888), <span class="occ">hymnologist and historian</span>, was born at Prince's Yard, Chesterfield, on 7 July 1818, the son of John George Stevenson (1792&#150;1866) and his wife, Jane Aldred, both Methodists. Educated at Duttoris grammar school, Chesterfield, he became an active Methodist in 1831, while an apprentice printer. Over the next dozen years, he practised his trade in Sheffield, London, and, from 1841, in Great Yarmouth, where he managed a printing business, established a lending library in connection with the local Methodist Sunday school, and occasionally preached.<br>
<br>In 1844 Stevenson entered Kay Shuttleworth's Battersea Training College (recently taken over by the National Society), and qualified as a teacher. His first post was as general superintendent of the Philanthropic Institute's reformatory school in St George's Fields, Southwark. In 1848 the society reconstituted its school as a Farm School for the Reformation of Criminal Boys in Redhill, and Stevenson became headmaster of the endowed parochial school at Lambeth Green. On 17 July 1850 he married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1822/3), the daughter of the Revd Thomas Thompson, whom he had met in Great Yarmouth; they had at least nine children. During this period he lectured to the Church Schoolmasters' Association and argued in a publication of 1853 that the origin of alphabetical characters was divine not human. In 1854 he helped to launch <span class="italic">The School and the Teacher</span>, a periodical for elementary schoolteachers, which advertised that it was conducted by church schoolmasters. A year later he gave up teaching for bookselling and publishing in Paternoster Row, where he published periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Pupil Teacher</span> (begun 1857), and a new series of the <span class="italic">English Journal of Education</span> (begun 1861), as well as cheap school books, sermons, pamphlets, and suitable Sunday reading.<br>
<br>From 1861 to 1867 Stevenson was editor and proprietor of <span class="italic">Wesleyan Times</span>, in which appeared his series of articles on hymnbooks and hymn writers. These articles were heavily used by other hymnologists such as Josiah Miller, and were the basis of Stevenson's <span class="italic">The Methodist Hymnbook and its Associations</span> (1870) and <span class="italic">The Methodist Hymn Book, Illustrated with Biography, History, Incident, and Anecdote</span> (1883). John Julian judged the latter an &#145;indispensable&#146; resource  (Julian, 1093&#150;4).<br>
<br>In addition to hymnology, Stevenson chronicled for nearly thirty years the career of the preacher Charles Spurgeon, beginning with <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Life of C. H. Spurgeon</span> (1857), and culminating in <span class="italic">Pastor C. H. Spurgeon: his Life and Work to his Fiftieth Birthday</span> (1885). His concern for Methodist history led him to write&#151;among other books&#151;<span class="italic">City Road Chapel, London, and its Associations</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Memorials of the Wesley Family</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Methodist Worthies</span> (1884) and to accumulate a considerable collection of Wesley memorabilia. Before 1873, when he gave up publishing to concentrate on his literary pursuits, he wrote before eight in the morning and after seven at night, on top of his family and business responsibilities. In this work he relied heavily, however, on the day-labour in the British Museum of his daughter May (Mary Anne), prompting one observer to draw a parallel with Milton and his daughters. By 1886, moreover, he had lost one eye, and appeared a &#145;doubtful character&#146;  (McKenny, 25), at least to the maidservant who left him standing in the hall when he came to call on the then-minister at City Road Chapel a few months after May's death. Three of his children died in young adulthood and were commemorated in his <span class="italic">Memorial Sketch of May Stevenson</span> (1886). This book gives a clear picture of the importance of the Methodist connection in east London where the family lived. Stevenson continued his active involvement in Methodist circles, editing, for example, a short-lived <span class="italic">Union Review and Chronicle of Wesleyan Methodist Literary and Mutual Improvement Associations</span> (1882), and reading papers at one of the nearly fifty such associations in London. Despite failing health, he met his society class only three weeks before his death at his home, 12 Gore Road, South Hackney, on 16 August 1888. He was buried on the 21st in Abney Park cemetery.<br>
