<span class="headword">Caddick family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1740&#150;<em>c.</em>1800), <span class="occ">portrait painters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_65539"></a><span class="headword">William Caddick</span>  (1719/20&#150;1794)<span class="occ"></span>. The events of his life and his paintings have often been confused with those of his sons, <a name="cosubject_60711"></a><span class="headword">Richard Caddick</span>  (1748&#150;1831)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_65540"></a><span class="headword">William Caddick</span>  (1756&#150;1784)<span class="occ"></span>. Seven portraits by the family are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; of these two are definitely by the father and one is by Richard. Eleven more whose attributions are traditional but not always safe are known from reproductions (among these is a portrait of Thomas Bentley, the Liverpool-based partner of Josiah Wedgwood); a further handful are known only from early sources and exhibition records.<br>
<br>The elder William is said to have been the son of William Caddick, Liverpool mercer, but the fact that the artist spelt his name Caddock in early life casts doubt on this, and he may have been the son William born on 9 April 1719 to William Chadock, shoemaker (although at his death on 29 December 1794 his age was given as seventy-four). Later accounts state that Caddick studied alongside George Stubbs and the marine painter Richard Wright. Entries for October 1746 in a diary kept by Caddick's friend William Clarke, when both men were working in Chester, show that Caddick often saw Wright and was in contact with Stubbs. This diary, which provides a unique glimpse of Caddick's early life, chiefly describes a short trip Clarke and Caddick made to London in August 1746, when they visited artists' studios, including those of Hudson, Ramsay, and Rysbrack, bought prints, and enjoyed life on the town.<br>
<br>Caddick's first securely attributed work, a small portrait of Aaron Wood of the Burslem family of potters (who were related by marriage to the Wedgwoods), is traditionally dated to the following year. An undated portrait of Wood's sister Eliza (1724&#150;1795), whom Caddick married about this time, was probably intended as its companion. The Caddicks and Woods apparently remained close. In 1768 Aaron Wood commissioned his nephew Richard Caddick to paint a portrait of his daughter Elizabeth; and about 1770 her younger brother Enoch was sent to Liverpool for three months to be instructed by all three Caddicks &#145;in the art of drawing, Perspective, Anatomy &amp;c &amp;c&#146;  (memorandum by Enoch Wood on the reverse of the portrait of Aaron Wood, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). A group portrait of about 1790 attributed to Richard Caddick in which items of pottery are prominent probably represents members of the two families. Liverpool's growth as a centre for the manufacture of pottery undoubtedly gained momentum from their connection.<br>
<br>William and Eliza had seven children, four boys and three girls, of whom Richard Caddick, born on 7 June 1748 at Old Hall Street, Liverpool, and baptized on 4 July at St Nicholas's Church, Liverpool, was probably the oldest. He and his brother William are the only two known to have reached maturity. If the statement by later local historians is true that Richard was a founder member of the first Society of Artists of Liverpool in 1769, his youthful reputation must have been considerable; but this may represent a confusion with his father, who the same sources say was elected president of the society when it was re-constituted shortly afterwards. A similar uncertainty exists over the authorship of the Caddicks' grandest work, the portrait of the Liverpool builder Joseph Brooks (1774). This chronic confusion, as well as the fact that almost always only one of the family is recorded in street directories, suggests that they operated virtually interchangeably as a family practice.<br>
<br>During the 1780s Richard probably lived away from Liverpool. The catalogue of the Society for Promoting Painting and Design in Liverpool's 1784 exhibition, at which he showed three portraits of gentlemen, describes him as &#145;visitor&#146;; and he is absent from its exhibition of 1787 altogether. From 1790, however, he is recorded as portrait painter in Old Hall Street, Liverpool; this corresponds with his father's disappearance from the directories following his death on 29 December 1794. About this time, too, Richard married. He and his wife, Martha (who died aged sixty-five in 1829), had one daughter, also Martha, born in 1797. Richard evidently gave up painting altogether about 1800. Between 1805 and 1829 he is described in street directories as &#145;gentleman&#146;. He died about 22 May 1831, leaving his daughter an estate valued at under &pound;4000, and was buried on 27 May.<br>
<br>Of the younger William, born on 16 June 1756, and baptized in St Nicholas's Church, Liverpool, on 13 July, almost nothing is known. The register recording his death on 12 March 1784 describes him as portrait painter, but no work can be certainly ascribed to him. Probably, however, it was he rather than his father who sent <span class="italic">Portrait in the Character of Circe</span> to the Royal Academy in 1780, the only work exhibited by any member of the family in London. With the exception of this last work, all above-mentioned portraits that survive are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.<br>
