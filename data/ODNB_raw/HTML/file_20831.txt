<span class="headword">Orm <span class="st"> [Ormin]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1175), <span class="occ">homilist and Augustinian canon</span>, is known by one work only, the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span>, in the dedication to which he indicates the order of which he was a member. The Augustinian house to which he belonged cannot be definitely identified; but Orm's dialect of English has been localized in south Lincolnshire, and it is possible that the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> was written in the Arrouaisian abbey at Bourne, a house of Augustinian canons founded in 1138. The name Orm (or Orrm, as he himself spells it in the dedication) is Scandinavian in origin, and its variant Ormin may have been formed by analogy with names such as Austin.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Ormulum</span>, preserved in Bodl. Oxf., MS Junius 1, is a collection of homilies in English, in which paraphrases of passages from the gospels are followed by exegetical commentary. Its title was given by Orm himself, who may have modelled the name on Latin <i>speculum</i> (&#145;mirror&#146;) used in the title of works such as <span class="italic">Speculum ecclesiae</span>. In the dedication Orm states that he was enjoined to undertake the work by Walter, his brother both physically and in God, for Walter too was an Augustinian canon; and Orm sets out his purpose as the elucidation of the gospel for the laity. The homilies of the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> were based on gospel readings for mass, arranged to follow the chronological order of the life of Christ. The table of contents lists 242 homilies, and the dedication refers to the work as having been <i>brohht till ende</i> (&#145;brought to an end&#146;; Bodl. Oxf., MS Junius 1, line 28), though as it survives in MS Junius 1 the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> contains only homilies 1 to 32 (the last of which is a fragment). It is certain that more was written than now survives in MS Junius 1, since Jan van Vliet, who owned the manuscript in the seventeenth century, left copies of some passages no longer present in Junius 1, which itself shows clear evidence of the loss of leaves. As well as having suffered damage the manuscript is irregular in form and untidy in layout, containing many corrections and alterations made during the process of copying; it is plainly not the work of a professional scribe, and is likely to have been written by Orm himself. On palaeographical grounds the completion of Junius 1 is dated early in the last quarter of the twelfth century, though its writing may have extended over a number of years.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> is the first substantial cycle of homilies in English known to have been composed since the works of &AElig;lfric, written about the end of the tenth century. Orm's exposition of scripture, like that of &AElig;lfric, is allegorical in method, and the Latin sources on which he drew for his exegesis included the <span class="italic">Glossa ordinaria</span> to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Bede's commentary on <span class="roman">Luke</span>, and the <span class="italic">Enarrationes in Matth&#339;i Evangelium</span>, a twelfth-century compilation. The homilies are composed in an unrhymed metrical form based on the Latin iambic septenarius, and in the dedication Orm acknowledges that his phrasing has often been influenced by the need to fill out the verse. Orm's literary style is repetitive and wordy, and its effect is not enhanced by the monotony of his invariably regular metre; but in its scope the work is ambitious, and it testifies to the role of the vernacular in the spiritual education of the laity.<br>
<br>The most remarkable feature of the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span>, however, is not its substance but its distinctive spelling system. This was probably intended as an aid to preachers who would read the work aloud, and it was evidently designed to represent speech sounds in a clearer and more consistent way than conventional orthography achieved. Orm's chief innovation was the use of double consonants to signify that the preceding vowel was short; in his system the first syllable of <i>Crisstenndom</i> (&#145;Christendom&#146;), for instance, was spelt with double s since its vowel was short, whereas single s was used after the long vowel of <i>Crist</i> (&#145;Christ&#146;). This method of denoting vowel length could not be extended to all words, since by its nature it was inapplicable to syllables that did not end in a consonant, and it was supplemented by the occasional use of accents to indicate long or short vowels. Orm's concern with the exact representation of sounds is shown also by his introduction of a new form of the letter g, which he used for the initial sound of words such as <i>Godd</i> (&#145;God&#146;), while reserving inherited forms of g for the sounds now represented by y in &#145;yet&#146; and dg in &#145;bridge&#146;. As well as adopting innovations in orthography, Orm showed an exceptional concern to achieve consistency in spelling, best illustrated by his treatment of words which in Old English had been written with eo, such as <i>beon</i> (&#145;be&#146;) and <i>cneow</i> (&#145;knew&#146;). In approximately the first 13,000 of the 20,000 lines of the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> that survive, such words were often spelt with eo, though in some instances with e; but after about line 13,000 Orm ceased to use eo, and o was then systematically erased from the words that had originally been written with eo in the preceding part of the manuscript. The magnitude of this labour of correction reveals the extraordinary care expended by Orm upon details of orthography. By virtue of its special system of spelling the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> is highly revealing about the pronunciation of the time, and it provides a major source of evidence for the linguistic study of early Middle English.<br>
