<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mallet <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Malloch]</span>,  David</span>  (1701/2?&#150;1765), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of James Malloch (<i>d</i>. 1723) and his wife, Beatrix Clerk, but it is not certain which of two couples of that name were his parents: one James was an innkeeper of Crieff, Perthshire; the other was a well-to-do tenant farmer at nearby Dunruchan. David was educated first at Crieff parish school then at Edinburgh high school, where he was a janitor. In both places his mentor was John Ker, writer of Latin poetry and later professor of humanity at Edinburgh. By 1720 Malloch was tutor to four sons of a Mr Home of Dreghorn, near Edinburgh, and had entered the university, where he made friends with James Thomson (1700&#150;1748) and other budding writers whose earliest published work, including four poems by Malloch, appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Miscellany</span> (1720). He was also befriended by the established poet Allan Ramsay (1686&#150;1758).<br>
<br>Malloch spent between three and four years at college but did not at this time proceed to a degree. He was recommended by his professors to James Graham, duke of Montrose (1682&#150;1742), a whig peer in the union parliament, as tutor to the duke's younger sons William and George, aged eleven and eight; so in August 1723 he went south and for the next three and a half years lived in his employer's residences in Hanover Square, London, and at Shawford, near Winchester, enjoying a salary of &pound;30 per annum plus keep.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsinLondon"></a>Early years in London</h2>Malloch's first literary success was <span class="italic">William and Margaret</span>, which is so free an adaptation of the traditional ballad &#145;Fair Margaret and Sweet William&#146; as to be an original work. First printed with Ramsay's <span class="italic">Jenny and Meggy</span> (1723), it was reprinted many times in song and ballad collections, including Thomas Percy's <span class="italic">Reliques</span> (1765), and occasionally as a broadside with music; it first appeared over Mallet's name in Savage's <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> (1726). Malloch's English imitation of John Ker's <span class="italic">Donaides</span> (1725), a Latin poem on Aberdeen University, achieved far less notice but earned him an Aberdeen AM degree on 11 January 1726.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">William and Margaret</span> made an early appearance in Aaron Hill's <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span> (24 July 1724), after which Malloch entered Hill's literary circle and became acquainted with other English poets, including Richard Savage, John Dyer, and Alexander Pope. When Thomson and other Edinburgh friends migrated to London, Malloch, who soon Anglicized his pronunciation and changed his name to Mallet, gave them valuable introductions. Between March and September 1727 Mallet made a short tour of Europe with his pupils the Montrose boys. It was said that when he was in Italy he was challenged by a Tuscan soldier named Flobert over a girl they were both in love with, but there was no duel  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.377, 386).<br>
<br>After his return Mallet wrote <span class="italic">The Excursion</span> (1728), a blank verse poem of deistic nature description similar to Thomson's <span class="italic">Summer</span>, and <span class="italic">A Poem to the Memory of Mr Congreve</span> (1729), which has been wrongly attributed to Thomson. Pope and Mallet together wrote the prologue to Thomson's tragedy <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span> (1730), after which Pope interested himself in the writing and staging of Mallet's tragedy <span class="italic">Eurydice</span>, which opened at Drury Lane on 22 February 1731 and ran for a respectable fourteen performances. (It is about Periander, tyrant of Corinth, not Orpheus or Creon.) Aaron Hill wrote the prologue and epilogue; the printed play was dedicated to the duke of Montrose. The anonymous <span class="italic">Remarks on Eurydice</span> (1731) is a mock &#145;Key&#146;, absurdly arguing that Mallet's play is a Jacobite allegory about the 1715 rising. Also in 1731 Mallet wrote an epitaph on his friend William Aikman, the painter, and his son, who died within weeks of one another. Mallet's <span class="italic">Of Verbal Criticism</span> (April 1733), an epistle in heroic couplets addressed to Pope, satirizes Bentley, Theobald, and other so-called pedants.<h2>
<a name="FriendshipwithPopeandoppositiontoWalpole"></a>Friendship with Pope and opposition to Walpole</h2>Pope's friendship for Mallet, &#145;whom I love and esteem greatly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.511), grew in the 1730s. When Mallet left Montrose's service in 1731 it was on Pope's recommendation that he became tutor to James Newsham (1715&#150;1769), stepson of John Knight of Gosfield, Essex. Tutor and pupil were admitted to St Mary Hall, Oxford, as gentlemen commoners and matriculated together on 2 November 1733: Mallet understating his own age as twenty-eight. His congratulatory verses to the prince of Orange on visiting Oxford were published in April 1734, coinciding with his receipt of three degrees: the Oxford BA on 15 March and MA on 6 April, and the Edinburgh MA on 16 April. Mallet and Newsham travelled abroad in 1735&#150;6: their itinerary is unrecorded except for visits to Paris, Geneva, and Hanover.<br>
<br>Mallet married a woman named Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1742), probably in 1734, after Oxford. They and their two children, Charles (<i>b</i>. 1735) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4986/', "Dorothea Celesia (bap. 1738, d. 1790)")</script>, lived at Strand on the Green, across the river from Kew, where Thomson lived, and close to Pope in Twickenham. Mallet was often in their company; he associated with Chesterfield, Bolingbroke, and others who opposed Walpole, and readily lent himself to the politico-literary campaign orchestrated by Lyttelton on behalf of the prince of Wales in the later 1730s. Thus it was that Mallet became one of the earliest victims of Walpole's stage <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> when part of his prologue to Thomson's contentious opposition play <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> was censored in January 1738. Mallet's own <span class="italic">Mustapha</span>, which opened at Drury Lane on 13 February 1739 and, like <span class="italic">Eurydice</span>, ran for fourteen nights, was a typical opposition piece in its parade of high-minded patriotic sentiments and denunciation of evil ministers. Pope and Bolingbroke thought highly of it; Thomson wrote the prologue; the printed play was dedicated to the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Alfred, a Masque</span> (1740), which glorifies the ideal of a patriot king, implicitly embodied in the prince of Wales, was written jointly with Thomson; the music was by Thomas Augustine Arne. A text revised and enlarged by Mallet, with additional music by Charles Burney and spectacular stage effects, was acted fifteen times at Drury Lane in 1751 and printed over Mallet's sole name; it was the only dramatic work of his to hold the stage after his death. Queen Elizabeth, another idealized patriot, is prominent in Mallet's <span class="italic">Life of Francis Bacon</span> (1740), which Fielding commended for its judgement and &#145;nervous manly style&#146;  (<span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span>, book 3, chap. 6). Gibbon, too, admired the &#145;vigorous sense&#146; of Mallet as a historian  (Gibbon, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 121). Vivid character sketches and spirited narrative make the <span class="italic">Life</span> of Bacon the most readable of Mallet's writings and induce regret that he could not or would not complete his life of Marlborough.<br>
<br>Mallet's wife, Susanna, died in January 1742. On 27 May Mallet was appointed under-secretary to the prince of Wales at &pound;100 per annum. On 2 October he was married by licence at St Andrew's, Holborn, to Lucy Elstob (1715/16&#150;1795), spinster, aged twenty-six. She was the youngest daughter of Lewis Elstob, steward to the earl of Carlisle, and brought a dowry of &pound;10,000, of which &pound;4000 was settled on herself. According to Gibbon, Lucy was a &#145;talkative, positive, passionate, conceited creature&#146;, though &#145;not destitute of wit and learning&#146; (Gibbon, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.155; <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 94). On the evidence of several affectionate poems, the most charming of which is &#145;Cupid and Hymen&#146; (1750), describing how family and friends will celebrate his eighth wedding anniversary, Mallet loved her not only for her money. The children of this marriage were Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1743) and Arabella (<i>b</i>. July 1745). Mallet's wife took care to see that her husband, a man of diminutive stature, was always very well-dressed, usually in black velvet. These circumstances lend some support to the conjecture that Mallet is the small, black-suited, seated figure on the left in Hogarth's well-known painting of Lord George Graham in his ship's cabin (1745). Graham was Mallet's friend and former pupil. No certain portrait of Mallet has been traced.<br>
<br>In October 1743 Mallet published a collected edition of his poems and plays. In 1744 he was at Pope's deathbed. In the same year Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, died and bequeathed &pound;500 apiece to Richard Glover and Mallet to write a life of her late husband, desiring that &#145;no part of the said history be in verse&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 14, 1744, 590&#150;91). Glover refused; Mallet, who had corresponded with the duchess about Marlborough's papers, accepted the commission, but made little or no progress in the remaining twenty years of his life. In the first half of 1745 he suffered from gout and visited the Netherlands for some unstated purpose, perhaps connected with the life of Marlborough. His <span class="italic">Amyntor and Theodora, or, The Hermit</span> (April 1747) is a blank verse narrative set on St Kilda and much indebted to Martin Martin's well-known description of that island in 1698. Mallet's poem, which he had originally conceived as a stage play, is dedicated to the earl of Chesterfield and prefaced by an affectionate poem to Mrs Mallet. It was sold to the booksellers for &pound;120 (compared with &pound;25 for <span class="italic">The Excursion</span>, a poem of comparable length, in 1728).<h2>
<a name="Bolingbrokesliteraryexecutor"></a>Bolingbroke's literary executor</h2>The prince dismissed Mallet from his under-secretaryship early in 1748 when Lyttelton (Mallet's patron) joined the government, whereupon both Chesterfield and Lyttelton sought a government post for him, but without success. Mallet wrote <span class="italic">A Congratulatory Letter to Selim</span> (April 1748) to defend Lyttelton against the charge of political apostasy, but continued to associate with Bolingbroke, the unpopular doyen of opposition, who prompted him in 1749 to write an advertisement attacking Pope for having clandestinely printed a garbled edition of Bolingbroke's <span class="italic">Patriot King</span>. Bolingbroke died in December 1751 and Mallet, as his literary executor, published his works between March 1752 and March 1754. Some had been first published by Richard Francklin and now became the subject of a copyright dispute; arbitrators judged that Mallet owed Francklin &pound;200 but he never paid; Francklin's consolation was the poor sale of Mallet's expensive edition. More seriously, Mallet included certain hitherto unpublished writings of which Johnson memorably wrote that Bolingbroke was &#145;a scoundrel for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality&#146; and &#145;a coward, because he had not resolution to fire it off himself, but left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 6 March 1754). Mallet was charged with mercenary motives but he had at least the courage of his religiously sceptical convictions.<br>
<br>Since 1748 the Mallets had lived in Putney, where their neighbour and friend was Edward Gibbon, father of the historian. They made a home for the elder Gibbon's niece and ward, Catherine Elliston, and advised on young Edward's tutor. When young Edward became a Roman Catholic in 1753 his father promptly took him to the freethinking Mallets, who plied him with philosophy, by which he was &#145;rather scandalized than reclaimed&#146;  (Gibbon, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 68), but they remained friends: Gibbon accepted Mallet's advice on his reading and writings, and was a frequent guest in his house. Mallet had a more guarded association with David Hume, who asked him to point out Scotticisms in the manuscript of his <span class="italic">History of England</span>. Hume lived, as he said, on &#145;good terms&#146; with Mallet, while conceding that he could be an &#145;irascible little man&#146;, but he cordially disliked Mallet's freethinking and assertive wife, who reportedly spoke of herself and Hume as &#145;We Deists&#146; (<span class="italic">New Letters of David Hume</span>, 68; <span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.307n.).<h2>
<a name="Workingforthegovernment"></a>Working for the government</h2>Mallet's patriotic <span class="italic">Britannia, a Masque</span>, with music by Arne, was performed as an afterpiece at Drury Lane on 9 May 1755 and achieved another dozen performances over the next three years. Its prologue, written and spoken by Garrick in the character of a drunken sailor reading a playbill, was very popular. At this time Mallet was eager to serve the government. In December 1753 he had indignantly rejected an invitation to write an opposition periodical for &pound;400 per annum  (BL, Add. MS 32733, fols. 614, 616). Visiting Paris in September 1755 and having highly placed French contacts, he offered to act as a spy  (BL, Add. MS 43772, fols. 55&#150;61). He was one of the authors hired to defame Admiral Byng: his pamphlet <span class="italic">Observations on the 12th Article of War</span>, by &#145;A Plain Man&#146;, was written in October 1756 and vetted by lords Hardwicke and Anson  (BL, Add. MS 35594, fols. 103, 236&#150;7, 254); its publication on 27 March 1757 was timed to justify the execution of Byng on 14 March; it earned him &pound;300 from the duke of Newcastle's secret service fund.<br>
<br>In 1758 Mallet moved to fashionable George Street, Hanover Square, and began to grow very corpulent. In 1759 his poems, plays, and <span class="italic">Life</span> of Bacon were reprinted in a three-volume edition of <span class="italic">Works</span>; also <span class="italic">Eurydice</span> was revived at Drury Lane and acted four times. In 1760 appeared his <span class="italic">Verses on the Death of Lady Anson</span> and <span class="italic">Edwin and Emma</span>, a ballad of unhappy love similar to but less successful than <span class="italic">William and Margaret</span>, and in 1761 <span class="italic">Truth in Rhyme</span>, a compliment to Bute, the new prime minister. These three new works and others were collected in <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1763), dedicated to the fourth duke of Marlborough with the promise that Mallet's life of his great ancestor would soon be finished. On 19 January 1763 Mallet's tragedy <span class="italic">Elvira</span>, based on Houdar de la Motte's <span class="italic">In&egrave;z de Castro</span>, opened at Drury Lane and ran for fourteen performances; the printed edition carried a politically contentious dedication to Bute. Mallet's recent services to the government were now rewarded with the post of inspector of the exchequer book in the outports of London, worth &pound;300 per annum. George Canning, the statesman's father, wrote &#145;Davy Malloch the Whig in his old age turn'd <i>Tory</i>&#146;  (&#145;On the Tragedy of Elvira&#146; in G. Canning, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1767, 89).<br>
<br>Mallet's private letters to Andrew Millar, Thomas Percy, Hume, and others in the 1760s disingenuously claim that his work on the life of Marlborough is nearly complete and would fill two quarto volumes, but no trace of such a work has been found. In 1764 the duchess of Douglas made Mallet one of her commissioners in the famous Douglas cause concerning the legitimacy of her nephew Archibald James Edward Douglas (1748&#150;1827). The cause took Mallet to Paris, the boy's birthplace, in 1764. Leaving his wife in France, he returned to England in poor health early in 1765, died at home on 21 April, and was buried on 27 April in St George's burial-ground, South Audley Street. According to Chesterfield he died &#145;of a diarrhoea, which he had carried with him to France, and brought back again hither&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; Chesterfield</span>, 22 April 1765); he was said to have been aged sixty-three.<br>
<br>By his will, proved in London on 8 May, Mallet bequeathed all his property to his wife. The contents of their house in Hanover Square, which were sold in July 1765, included a fine-toned French horn with a silver mouthpiece and a chamber organ. Mallet's large library, sold in March 1766, contained as many French books as English. Manuscripts he had inherited directly from Bolingbroke and from Pope via Bolingbroke, including Pope's Homer, were given by his widow to the British Library (Add. MSS 4807&#150;4809 and 4948 A and B). Thereafter Mrs Mallet lived in France. She was imprisoned during the Revolution with her daughter Lucy (Mrs Macgregor), and died in Paris on 17 September 1795, aged seventy-nine. Mrs Macgregor died insane in Paris before her mother. The other daughter, Arabella, who married a Captain Williams RE, and parted from him after two months, was the chief beneficiary of Mrs Mallet's will. The fate of her stepson Charles is not known; his sister Dorothea died in 1790 in Italy, where she had lived since 1759, having married young to escape her stepmother's tyranny  (Gibbon, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 22 May 1764, 65).<h2>
<a name="Literaryreputation"></a>Literary reputation</h2>Mallet is best-known in Johnson's hostile <span class="italic">Life</span>, coloured as it is by an (unexpressed) detestation of freethinking. Johnson charges Mallet rightly with being vain and mercenary, though it is not true that he &#145;was the only Scot whom Scotchmen did not commend&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 3.403), for he had good friends among Scots as well as English. Mallet's poems and plays were reprinted in standard collections into the nineteenth century; French, German, and Italian translations of his <span class="italic">Life of Bacon</span> were still appearing after his death; his <span class="italic">William and Margaret</span> played a significant part in the eighteenth-century ballad revival and has remained a frequent anthology piece; nevertheless these flickers of afterlife do not refute Johnson's judgement that Mallet's works were such as could be kept alive during the author's lifetime by the &#145;personal influence&#146; of &#145;a writer, bustling in the world&#146;, but which, &#145;conveying little information and giving no great pleasure, must soon give way&#146; to &#145;other modes of amusement&#146;  (ibid., 410).<br>
