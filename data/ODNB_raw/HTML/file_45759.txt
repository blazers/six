<span class="headword">Bradmore,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1412), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was resident in London from at least 1377 until his death. He married twice; his first wife, Margaret, with whom he had a daughter, Agnes, died some time after May 1410, and he married again without delay. His son, Nicholas, was born after his death to his second wife, Katherine.<br>
<br>In 1386 John Bradmore and his brother Nicholas, also a surgeon, were accused of false coining, but were pardoned. John later supported Nicholas in another brush with the law, but appears himself to have led a peaceful and blameless life.<br>
<br>Some time between 1403 and his death Bradmore compiled a lengthy surgical treatise in Latin, which he entitled <span class="italic">Philomena</span>; this survives as BL, Sloane MS 2272. A Middle English translation of part of this work, made after his death, appears in BL, Harley MS 1736, and extracts from the Latin text in Oxford, All Souls College, MS 73. In his treatise Bradmore gives details of several cases of interest, chief among which is his treatment of Henry, prince of Wales, later Henry V, for a facial wound received at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. An arrowhead entered the prince's face beside his nose and became lodged in the bone. After various others had failed to remove the arrowhead Bradmore devised and made an instrument to remove it without further damage to the surrounding flesh. His subsequent treatment of the wound is given in detail. Bradmore had been connected with the royal household since at least 1399, in which year he treated the master of the king's pavilions, William Wyncelowe, for an extensive abdominal wound resulting from a failed suicide attempt. Full details of this case are also given in <span class="italic">Philomena</span>. Bradmore received payments from the royal household for fees and robes in 1403 and 1406, and appears also to have received an annuity of 10 marks from the prince of Wales. His appointment in 1408 to the office of searcher of the port of London brought a further annual payment of &pound;10.<br>
<br>An oath taken before the mayor and aldermen in the Guildhall in April 1390 appears to have appointed Bradmore, with three others, to be in some way overseer of surgery within the city of London. In 1390&#150;91 and again in 1402 he treated monks in Westminster Abbey Infirmary. He was clearly prosperous, and from 1391 he began to acquire property within the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, city of London, in which he was resident. From 1391 until his death he lived in a tenement situated on the east side of Aldersgate Street, opposite the parish church. In 1399 he purchased the adjoining garden. At the time of his death he owned four tenements, one of which he bequeathed to his daughter, Agnes, and the remaining three to his second wife, Katherine, and her child. Shortly after his death his widow's property was assessed in the lay subsidy roll of 1412 as having an annual rental value of &pound;4 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Bradmore and his first wife, Margaret, were among the founder members in 1377 of the fraternity of the Holy Trinity in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate. In 1400 he was churchwarden of the parish church, and in 1409&#150;10 he was master of the fraternity of the Trinity. In his will he bequeathed a cloth of silk to this fraternity and money to the lesser fraternity of Sts Fabian and Sebastian in the same church. In addition, the reversion of the property left to his daughter, his wife, and her expected child was bequeathed to the fraternity of the Holy Trinity if the child should die without legitimate heirs (and indeed the property was in the hands of the fraternity by 1447). Bradmore died on 27 January 1412 in his home parish, and was buried in the church of St Botolph, where a monument commemorating him and both his wives existed before the great fire of 1666.<br>
