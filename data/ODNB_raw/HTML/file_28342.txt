<span class="headword">Vivian, Sir  Robert John Hussey</span>  (1802&#150;1887), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Arundel, Sussex, an illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28341/', "Richard Hussey Vivian, first Baron Vivian (1775&#150;1842)")</script>. He was brought up as one of the family, and was educated at Dr Burney's academy, Gosport, and on the continent, in part at Beauvais and Dresden. He entered the Madras army as ensign on 12 June 1819, was immediately promoted lieutenant, and served in the 10th native infantry until 1824. That year he was posted to the 18th Madras native infantry for service in Burma under Sir Archibald Campbell.<br>
<br>Vivian took part in the capture of Rangoon in May 1824, was made adjutant of the battalion on 4 June, and fought in several actions between 1824 and 1826 including the battle of Pagan (9 February 1826). He was promoted captain on 1 August 1825. At the end of the war he resigned the adjutancy, and went home on leave.<br>
<br>When Vivian returned to India in July 1827 he was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the Nagpur subsidiary force, and in May 1830 was transferred in a similar capacity to the light field division of the Hyderabad subsidiary force at Jalna. After nearly four years' furlough at home he resumed this appointment until his promotion to major on 9 December 1836. On 18 January 1837 he took command at Madras of a battalion of the 10th Madras native infantry, and shortly after accompanied it to Belgaum. In February 1841 he captured Fort Napani and received the thanks of Sir Robert Dick, the commander-in-chief, and of the governor in council at Bombay.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1841 Vivian was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and on 5 January 1843 was posted to the 1st Madras European regiment (later the Royal Dublin Fusiliers). From 1844 to 1847 he was on furlough, marrying in 1846 Emma (<i>d</i>. 1887), widow of Captain Gordon of the Madras army. On his return to India he commanded several native infantry regiments in succession. On 14 August 1849 he was appointed adjutant-general of the Madras army. He was promoted brevet colonel on 15 September 1851, and resigned as adjutant-general in August 1853.<br>
<br>Vivian returned to England in January 1854, and on 28 November was promoted major-general. In 1855 he became a director of the East India Company. Several British officers served with the Turkish army in the Crimea, among them Vivian, who was the most senior. He held the Turkish rank of lieutenant-general after joining on 25 May 1855, and during the winter of 1855&#150;6 he occupied the Kerch peninsula with his troops. He received the thanks of the government and the first class of the Turkish order of the Mejidiye. While commanding the Turkish contingent Vivian clashed with Major-General W. F. Beatson, who was commanding bashi-bazouks. Beatson, an East India Company officer, went home angry, subsequently bringing an action against Vivian, which Vivian won.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1857 Vivian was made KCB, and on 21 September 1858 he was appointed a member of the new Council of India. On 30 September 1862 he was given the colonelcy of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, was promoted lieutenant-general on 24 October 1862, and general on 22 November 1870. He was made GCB on 20 May 1871. He retired from the army in 1877 and died on 3 May that year at his residence, 10 Eaton Gardens, Hove, Sussex, his wife having died four days earlier.<br>
