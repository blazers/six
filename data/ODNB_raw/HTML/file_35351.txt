<span class="headword">Page, Sir  Leo Francis</span>  (1890&#150;1951), <span class="occ">magistrate</span>, was born on 2 April 1890 at Hobart, Tasmania, the youngest of six sons, only two of whom survived childhood, of William Humphrey Page, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Richard Pope. His father had become a Roman Catholic in early manhood and Leo was educated at Beaumont College, Berkshire. At the wish of his father he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and after a year transferred to the 16th lancers. But he was not suited to the army and withdrew. He entered University College, Oxford, where he obtained a second in jurisprudence in 1914. On the outbreak of war he joined the Royal Flying Corps, but after a serious accident while bringing home a plane from France he was invalided out in 1916, having attained the rank of flight commander. In that year he married Edith Violet, daughter of Captain Frederick Cleave Loder-Symonds RA, of Hinton Manor, Faringdon, Berkshire, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Page became a member of the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1918. He practised for several years and had reason to anticipate success, but he was never robust and tuberculosis developed. Enjoying a secure private income, he abandoned practice and settled with his family at Faringdon. There in 1925 he became a justice of the peace for Berkshire and a member of the bench at Faringdon where his father-in-law had earlier been chairman for many years. In 1946 he himself was elected chairman, an office which he held until his death. He also served as chairman of the local juvenile court and for a period as chairman of the appeals committee at the Berkshire quarter sessions.<br>
<br>In all this work Page took more than the ordinary interest. While doing his full share of the court work, he made a deep study of the problems of local justice. Not content with his limited experience in a rural court, he visited many other courts in different parts of the country. This qualified him to write several books about the work of magistrates, on which he became a leading authority. The most influential were <span class="italic">Justice of the Peace</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Crime and the Community</span> (1937). In court, while always merciful, Page was a realist and more open to appeals to reason than to sentiment.<br>
<br>Although he was known primarily as a leading justice of the peace, Page also gave much time and enthusiasm to helping prisoners and former prisoners, and prisons and borstals became his main interest in his later years. From 1939 for many years afterwards he was chairman of the visiting magistrates at Oxford prison; he also became chairman of its Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society. He took a keen interest in many individual cases and kept in touch with some of them after their release. No case which Page considered deserving was too much trouble for him, although he had a quick eye for those who sought to impose on him without adequate effort to make good. He favoured probation while also recognizing the need for deterrence.<br>
<br>From 1940 to 1945 Page served in the Lord Chancellor's Department as secretary of commissions of the peace. He had a freer hand than was usual since Lord Simon was much occupied with wartime problems outside his office. Page was considerably shocked by much of what he saw. Many of those recommended for appointment as justices of the peace in local areas were, in his own words, &#145;older than was desirable&#146;, and selected in recognition of some other form of public service. It was &#145;rare to find anyone wholly without political connection&#146;. Page did all he could to improve matters. The reforms which took place after the war were not yet being planned, but Page's influence on them was apparent when they came. It was he who influenced the lord chancellor to secure the passing into law of the <span class="roman">Justices (Supplemental List) Act</span> in 1941, which empowered the lord chancellor to prevent elderly and infirm lay justices from sitting in court.<br>
<br>Page was essentially a conservative reformer. Keen and successful though he was in bringing about many reforms within the existing system, he was apparently not aware that demands were being made for radical changes in the system itself. To some extent his mind widened as his experience increased. In 1937 Page was nominated by his bench as its representative on the council of the Magistrates' Association, many of whose members, without being in any way extremists, had ideas for reform beyond what Page then considered reasonable. To such members Page seemed unwilling to pursue his ideas to their logical conclusion. For instance, while he profoundly believed that criminal courts should be better informed about the offenders whom they convicted, he was at first satisfied with the existing method whereby such social inquiries as were made about offenders took place before trial and thus before guilt was established. A substantial majority took the view that most serious cases should be adjourned after conviction for full inquiries to be made before sentence was passed. Page resigned in protest in 1940 and took no further part in the association's work. This was mainly due to the claims of his official work, but when this ceased he did not return to the association, although he later came to accept the idea that serious cases should be adjourned for inquiries only after conviction.<br>
<br>In 1946 a strong royal commission was set up under Lord du Parcq to inquire into the work of justices of the peace. Page's evidence was printed as an appendix to its minutes of evidence. The report of this commission (1948) greatly influenced the preparation of the post-war reforms and reflected many of the ideas which Page had laid before it. Valuable as the new code was, the reforms were all within the existing system and on some points were less drastic than Page himself had hoped.<br>
<br>The usefulness of psychiatry was gradually realized by Page, who wrote that &#145;medical men who have specialised in this branch of research have a very definite and valuable contribution to make to the treatment of delinquency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, April 1940). However, in his view the help of such experts applied only to abnormal cases and should be limited to examining and reporting on offenders. He did not sympathize with the idea that psychiatrists should share the responsibility of selecting appropriate sentences, a task which Page considered only those on the bench were competent to perform, although he urged that they should be better informed about the various methods of dealing with offenders. Thus in 1948 he wrote in his book <span class="italic">The Sentence of the Court</span> that all those on the bench, including professional lawyers, should receive instruction which would fit them to pass sentence. But he put forward no plan whereby lawyers appointed in mid-life to the criminal bench could receive such instruction. His last book, <span class="italic">The Young Lag</span> (1950), reviewed the treatment of young offenders.<br>
<br>Page was high sheriff for his county in 1937, and in 1948 he received a knighthood. Although afflicted by severe ill health he continued bravely with as much work as he could undertake. His consistent love, sympathy, and understanding for suffering humanity and his humility were the qualities most valued by his friends; to the end his sense of humour never left him. He died at his home at Faringdon, Berkshire, on 31 August 1951. A contemporary tribute described his life as one &#145;of service and self-sacrifice. Few men have done more for those who are, by the standard of many, the least hopeful material and the least deserving&#146;  (<span class="italic">Justice of the Peace</span>, 559).<br>
