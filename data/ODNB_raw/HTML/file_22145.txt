<span class="headword">Phillips <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Payton]</span>,  Catherine</span>  (1727&#150;1794), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, was born on 16 March 1727 at Dudley, Worcestershire, the youngest of the six children of Henry Payton (1671&#150;1746), Quaker minister, and his second wife, Ann (<i>c</i>.1673&#150;1774), daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Fowler of Evesham. Educated mainly at home, Catherine was intelligent and widely read but later she felt that reading poetry, philosophy, and history tended to lead her away from true religion. She first ministered at Dudley in 1748, aged twenty-two, &#145;in but a few words&#146;. From this small beginning Catherine embarked on a career of almost constant travel, as a &#145;public Friend&#146;, for the next thirty years. Besides repeated visits to most of the counties in England and Wales her travels extended to Ireland, Scotland, and the Netherlands. She also visited America from 1753 to 1756 and on other occasions, and travelled in total almost 9000 miles within that country.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Catherine campaigned for structures that would allow women to take their full part in the running of the Society of Friends. Her own relationships with women, both relatives and friends, some of whom travelled with her, were close and supportive. In her public role, however, Catherine did not court popularity and she conceded in later life that she may have taken this resolve too far. She had an air of command which some found difficult in a woman&#151;James Jenkins, a critical fellow Quaker, called her &#145;a great Autocratrix&#146;&#151;but she was clear in her own mind that the respect she demanded was for the ministry of God and not for herself.<br>
<br>Catherine Payton met William Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1785) for the first time at the very beginning of her ministry in Wales in 1749. He worked in the copper-mining business in Cornwall and was a widower with two young sons. He was attracted to Catherine but she was unwilling to contemplate any connection that might detract from her ministry, and so broke off communications. They met again and resumed a correspondence in 1766 but it was not until 15 July 1772, when Catherine was forty-five and William's sons had grown up, that she and William eventually married at Bewdley in Worcestershire. They moved to William's home in Cornwall, where Catherine also had numerous relatives. After her marriage Catherine continued to travel, supported by William's organizational skills; their partnership continued until William died on 12 August 1785.<br>
<br>Most of Catherine Phillips's writings appeared just before or after her death, mainly published by her stepson James Phillips. Her principal work was her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, begun after William's death, partly as a memorial to him. Several of Catherine's epistles appeared in collections of letters by eminent Quakers. Her other notable publication was <span class="italic">The Happy King: a Sacred Poem</span>, addressed to George III, which is chiefly a polemic against slavery. Catherine's travels were often punctuated by illness and she was weakened by several serious falls from horses. After her husband's death her health declined further until she died at Redruth in Cornwall on 16 August 1794; she was buried at Kea, near Truro.<br>
