<span class="headword">Tarrant,  Margaret Winifred</span>  (1888&#150;1959), <span class="occ">artist and illustrator</span>, was born on 19 August 1888 at 1 Stanley Villas, St James's Road, Battersea, London, the only child of the artist Percy Tarrant (1855&#150;1934) and his wife, Sarah Wyatt (1846&#150;1934). Encouraged by her father, she excelled at drawing and painting from an early age, and while attending Clapham high school won several awards which encouraged her to become an art teacher. However, concerned about her ability to instruct, she decided that teaching was not for her and, after discussion with her father, became a full-time artist and illustrator.<br>
<br>In 1907 the family moved to Gomshall, in Surrey, and in 1908&#151;at the age of nineteen&#151;Margaret Tarrant undertook her first commission, to illustrate Charles Kingsley's <span class="italic">The Water-Babies</span> for J. M. Dent &amp; Sons. Other commissions followed, including <span class="italic">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Fairy Stories from Hans Christian Andersen</span> (1917), and <span class="italic">Nursery Rhymes</span> (1914; 5th edn, 1922) for Ward Lock &amp; Co., and two sets of postcards for the Oxford University Press. She also illustrated some twenty books for the publisher George G. Harrap between 1915 and 1929. Always concerned with improving her techniques, she attended several courses at Heatherley's Art School during this period.<br>
<br>In 1920 Tarrant began working regularly for the Medici Society, a long and fruitful association which led to her being made a shareholder in the company in 1938. During the 1920s she illustrated a highly successful series of fairy books for the company. These were first published at the same time as the rather better known series of <span class="roman">Flower Fairy</span> illustrations by her friend and sketching partner Cicely Mary Barker, who was later to become an executor of Margaret's will.<br>
<br>In 1934 both of Tarrant's parents died within three months of each other. Her father had always been an inspiration to her, and she had written to the Medici Society during his final illness: &#145;I miss his ever ready criticism and help with my work so much &hellip; I may say that I have no other relatives&#146;  (priv. coll.). Shortly after this, Tarrant moved to Peaslake in Surrey, and she soon became a well-known figure in the community there. Although she never married, she made many loyal and long-lasting friends, both through her painting and her membership of the local church. Her friends described her as full of energy, travelling around the area on an ancient bicycle to save petrol, despite not always being in the best of health herself. Many neighbours were used as models for her pictures. She was well known for her love of animals and for her formidable cat companion, Bobby.<br>
<br>A deeply religious individual, Margaret Tarrant was inspired to paint many spiritual and scripture-based paintings, which the Medici Society published as prints and postcards. She was her own harshest critic, and later regretted the sentimentality of some of these paintings, such as <span class="italic">All Things Wise and Wonderful</span>, first published in 1925. Ironically, it is probably for these pictures that she is best remembered.<br>
<br>While her paintings and illustrations were often of fairies or religious subjects, Tarrant believed fervently in sketching from life, though her finished works often exhibit a much romanticized style. Many of her paintings were bordered with leaves and flowers characteristic of the arts and crafts movement and the art nouveau style which she much admired. Her true love lay in painting wild flowers, of which she had an extensive knowledge, and she considered the illustrations for a series of wild flower postcards published by the Medici Society between 1937 and 1952 to be among her best works.<br>
<br>Shortly before the Second World War Tarrant was finding it hard to be inspired in her work, so in 1936 the Medici Society financed a six-week trip to Palestine. It was hoped that she would produce more paintings in the same vein as <span class="italic">All Things Wise and Wonderful</span>. Bravely travelling only with a female artist friend, Margaret said of her visit to the Middle East: &#145;I think they [the Medici Society] expected some more of my children's cards but with an Israeli flavour, but they didn't get them&#151;Israel wasn't like that&#146;  (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>During the early 1950s Tarrant's eyesight began to deteriorate, a source of great frustration to her. Her health in general was not so good, although she still made the effort to go into the countryside and sketch from life whenever she could. Eventually multiple myeloma (a type of cancer causing gradual deterioration of the bones) was diagnosed, and Tarrant spent some months in hospital bearing her illness with characteristic good humour and inner strength. She died at her home, Troon, Wonham Way, Peaslake, on 28 July 1959, leaving some pictures to friends and the rest of her estate to twelve charities. Her work is still popular and much of it remains in print as greetings cards, postcards, and prints.<br>
