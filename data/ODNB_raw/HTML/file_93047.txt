<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Janou&#353;ek,  Karel</span>  (1893&#150;1971), <span class="occ">officer in the Czech air force</span>, was born in P&#345;erov, Moravia, on 30 October 1893, the son of Karel Janou&#353;ek and his wife, Adelheid. During his national service with the Austrian army he fought in Italy in the First World War, but then joined the renegade Czech Legion, fighting alongside the Russians and against the Austrians, on the eastern front. When Czechoslovakia gained independence in October 1918 Janou&#353;ek committed himself to a military career, graduating from the army academy in Prague in 1923. He joined the Czechoslovak air force in 1924, and by 1937 he had risen to the rank of brigadier-general. In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, he was awarded his doctorate in sciences by Charles University.<br>
<br>From the outset of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 Janou&#353;ek had quietly assisted the escape of many Czech and Slovak servicemen, but when Poland was invaded in September, and the German occupation became more oppressive, he along with most of the officer corps knew that they must save their own lives. Most of the Czechoslovak government and high command fled to France, and from there to England in June 1940. On their arrival there was in effect a mutiny in the ranks, which ultimately led to Janou&#353;ek replacing Brigadier-General Josef Slez&aacute;k as head of the exiled air force. It proved to be a good choice, and for the next five years Janou&#353;ek worked tirelessly for his men in their efforts to defeat the axis powers and liberate their homes and families. He supervised the creation of 310 (Czechoslovak) fighter squadron in July 1940 which, together with 312 Squadron formed in August, rendered distinguished service in the battle of Britain. In total, eighty-eight Czech and Slovak pilots flew in that great struggle, eight of them losing their lives in action.<br>
<br>As inspector-general of the Czechoslovak air force, Janou&#353;ek was a man of influence but no real power. His was a difficult task indeed. The government he served under President Edvard Bene&#353; was riven with internal rivalries and volatile personalities. A small army group of some 4000 men was largely inactive between 1940 and 1944, but the air force&#151;three fighter squadrons and one bomber squadron&#151;was frequently in the heat of battle. For its part the British Air Ministry saw no need for a fully independent Czechoslovak air force. The official reason was that the contingent was too small to function effectively without considerable numbers of British ground crew and maintenance specialists. In itself this was perfectly true, but the British also deeply distrusted the political agenda of the Czechsolovak government-in-exile, fearing that independence would fuel the demands of Bene&#353; for an exaggerated status in the post-war peace settlement. Thus the 1600 officers and other ranks were classified as volunteers within the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. This stung the pride of some of the Czech leadership who saw no reason why they should not have an independent national unit such as the Polish enjoyed. Janou&#353;ek soothed passions by patiently arguing that the British would not yield on this matter, and that to press the issue ran the risk of the dismemberment of the force and the scattering of its best pilots throughout the RAF.<br>
<br>Janou&#353;ek was also involved in fierce disputes concerning poor recruitment and the replacement of combat losses. Much of his energy was spent arguing with his superior, General Sergei Ingr, at the headquarters of the exiled government at Wingrave Manor in Buckinghamshire. Ingr consistently refused to transfer men from the dormant army group into the air force units, but Janou&#353;ek kept battering away at the political and personal obstacles to keep his men in the air. He won and lost many arguments at the cabinet table, but his air force did not wither. In 1941, a grateful Air Ministry promoted him to the rank of air vice-marshal, and King George VI conferred on him the Order of the Bath (KCB) in recognition of his military service as a foreign national. Janou&#353;ek was trusted by the British. Knowing exactly what he could ask for, and how to ask for it, he occupied an unenviable position as the intermediary between the RAF&#151;who wanted only stability and calm&#151;and his political and military masters, most of whom were hungry for prestige and personal advancement. But although he had made several enemies within his own government, the officers and men of the Czechoslovak air force recognized him for the leader that he was.<br>
<br>In 1945, at the war's end, Janou&#353;ek was promoted to air marshal for the services he and his men had rendered Britain and her allies. Over 530 Czech and Slovak personnel had died for their cause, but Janou&#353;ek and his superiors knew that their struggles were not yet behind them. The Red Army now occupied Prague, and a triumphant return of the Czechoslovak forces, including a magnificent flypast across the capital, was soon overshadowed by political machinations at the heart of government. Within weeks of the return Janou&#353;ek had been replaced by his old adversary, Josef Slez&aacute;k, and one by one the Western commanders were forced into retirement or exile by officers more sympathetic to the Communists. Janou&#353;ek's last mission was to return to England in the spring of 1946 formally to sever the links between his force and the RAF. He was offered several staff posts in the Air Ministry, all of which he refused, and he returned to Prague to meet his fate and look after his men as their units were disbanded.<br>
<br>In 1948, when the Communist <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> displaced the government of Edvard Bene&#353;, Janou&#353;ek was arrested and tried as &#145;an enemy of the people&#146;. He was sentenced to nineteen years. On appeal this was extended to life imprisonment, but he was released in 1960 as part of a general amnesty for officers who had served in the West. Stripped of his rank and his decorations, he lived as a private citizen, working in an engineering factory until he was pardoned in 1968. He died in Prague on 27 October 1971. In 1990 all his former laurels were restored after the &#145;velvet revolution&#146;, and in 1991 he was posthumously promoted to the rank of full general <i>in memoriam</i>.<br>
