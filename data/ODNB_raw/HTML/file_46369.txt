<span class="headword">Theobald,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1688, <em>d.</em> 1759), <span class="occ">merchant and antiquary</span>, was baptized at St Mary's, Lambeth, Surrey, on 21 June 1688, the eldest surviving son of Peter Theobald (1656&#150;1742) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1662), the daughter of Thomas Gleane. He was apprenticed to his father in the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company from 1704 until 1712, and, together with his brother Peter (1694&#150;1778), became a freeman of the City on 4 July 1727. They were both elected court assistants in 1745, James was master in 1750, and Peter became warden in 1753. On 22 March 1715 James married Sarah, the daughter of Josiah Kingsman of Horndon-on-Hill, Essex (to whose son William Peter Theobald was apprenticed). Of their three daughters, only Martha (<i>b</i>. 1716), the eldest, reached maturity; a son, James, was baptized at Lambeth on 9 May 1720.<br>
<br>The Theobalds were prominent timber merchants. James's grandfather, Daniel, had been a Southwark shipwright; his father, who was importing Norwegian timber by the 1680s, built up a thriving trade at Lambeth, and was joined by his two sons before 1722. In 1733 they provided the trustees for Georgia with a large model of a Dutch sawmill, which was shipped to the colony. From 1728 they acted as trustees to Archbishop Tenison's girls' charity school at Lambeth and to Peterson's charity in St Saviour's parish, Southwark, where James acquired property, including the local workhouse. In a document for 1727 the two brothers are named as lords of the manor of Old Paris Garden, Southwark. Theobald Street, Southwark, commemorates the family.<br>
<br>From 1723 Theobald lived at Belvedere House in Lambeth. By 1739 he had moved to Surrey Street, off the Strand, and in 1743 inherited considerable property from his father in London, Surrey, and Leicestershire. The following year he purchased as his country residence Hill House, which he renamed Waltham Place, at White Waltham in Berkshire. From 1728 to 1734 he was the duke of Chandos's main financial intermediary, enabling John Wood to build Queen Square in Bath; he also lent the contractor Ralph Allen capital to resurface St Bartholomew's Hospital with Bath stone between 1730 and 1732. As a governor and committee member of Thomas Coram's Foundling Hospital, he made manuscript corrections in July 1740 to a report entitled <span class="italic">A Sketch of the General Plan for Executing the Purposes of the Royal Charter</span>.<br>
<br>James and Peter Theobald's private Bank of England drawing office accounts, dating from 1727, reveal extensive Scandinavian trading. James owned wharves, docks, warehouses, and a timber yard in Southwark. He ran his own company (1742&#150;9), served as a bank director (1743&#150;56), and held bank stock. (Peter was also a director, from 1756 to 1768.) They joined the Russia Company in 1741, and James became a governor of the Merchant Seamen's Corporation in June 1747.<br>
<br>Theobald was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 4 November 1725; he later served as council member and auditor (1728&#150;42). He supplied the society with its firewood and helped to reorganize and conserve its museum collections. In February 1742 he was awarded the society's Copley silver medal for his work on a committee set up in December 1736 to produce the medal. An influential member, he made 121 introductions and signed thirty-two certificates between 1727 and 1757. He also communicated a considerable amount of material about Scandinavian natural history and antiquities to the society and the Society of Antiquaries (to which he was elected on 23 November 1726). In particular he summarized and read an account of Swedenborg's <span class="italic">Principia rerum naturalium</span> (1734) to the Royal Society at three meetings held in 1737 and 1738.<br>
<br>Theobald served as joint secretary to the Society of Antiquaries from 3 January 1728 to 1735, and became an honorary member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society on 28 June 1733. He was elected a vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries in November 1750, and was a leading force in procuring the society's deed of incorporation in 1751 and implementing numerous innovative changes (1733&#150;54). In 1754 the society published his questionnaire, designed to obtain factual data about antiquities, natural history, agriculture, and manufactures on a parochial basis; he himself compiled the histories of eighteen parishes in ten counties between 1755 and 1758, illustrating them with his own pen and wash drawings. His handwritten account of Margate in 1756, with well-executed sketches of the church, the harbour, and a horse-drawn bathing machine, is bound up with the society's library copy of John Lewis's history of the Isle of Thanet (1736). When Henry Baker suggested that members should record significant contemporary events for posterity, Theobald wrote some useful accounts of the York Street Watergate (May 1757) and the Arundel marbles, followed, in June 1758, by &#145;An account of the rise and progress of the Society of London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce&#146; (Society of Antiquaries of London, Ants. Papers 1758), on which Thomas Mortimer's anonymous <span class="italic">Concise Account of the Society of Arts</span> (1763) was largely based. This manuscript, which was rediscovered in 1994, is a valuable source of additional information about the society, which Theobald joined in December 1754 and of which he became vice-president on 5 February 1755; his brother Peter and son James were also active members. Theobald's antiquarian miscellany  (BL, Add. MS 45663) is a good indicator of his wide interests.<br>
<br>Theobald was a pallbearer at the funeral of his friend Sir Hans Sloane in January 1753 and a Sloane trustee; he had presented Sloane with seventy-nine specimens for his natural history collections. Theobald also promoted the career of the naturalist George Edwards, who singled him out as one of his earliest patrons. Theobald's magnificent lustre chandelier, presented in 1754, forms the centrepiece of Barber&#150;Surgeons' Hall. His impressive collection of natural history objects, coins, medals, prints, and drawings was auctioned in 1768. Peter Theobald's house at Kew Green later became the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens.<br>
<br>Theobald's second marriage, on 18 March 1735, to Elizabeth, the daughter of James Whitchurch and a niece of Baron Scrope, brought a dowry of &pound;10,000. In 1749 he also inherited the Somerset manors of Nunney Castle and Nunney Mawdley from the Whitchurch family, and in 1754 he bought Grays Thurrock Manor, Essex. He died on 20 February 1759, and his widow, Elizabeth, on 18 June 1759, in Surrey Street.<br>
