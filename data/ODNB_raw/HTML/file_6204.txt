<span class="headword">Coombes,  William Henry</span>  (1767&#150;1850), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born on 8 May 1767, at Meadgate in Camerton, Somerset, where his family was well established. His grandfather had been the local blacksmith, and it seems likely that George Coombes, the landlord of the Camerton Inn, was William Henry's father. It was probably his uncle, the Revd William Coombes, vicar-general of the western district, who sent him to the English College at Douai, where he was admitted on 22 July 1779. He was ordained priest in 1791 and taught at the college in 1792&#150;3. During the tumult of the French Revolution, Coombes twice escaped from Douai, the second time successfully, reaching Austrian lines on 20 October 1793. On his arrival in England he was appointed professor of theology at Old Hall Green College. He was an accomplished Greek scholar, and in 1797 he published <span class="italic">Sacred Eloquence</span>, a selection of readings from the Greek fathers. This was followed in 1799 by the publication of an account of his escape from Douai. He also published some letters on Catholic matters in William Cobbett's <span class="italic">Register</span>, under the pseudonym of &#145;the British Observer&#146;, between 1804 and 1806. On 12 December 1801 Pope Pius VII conferred upon him a DD.<br>
<br>In 1810 Coombes accepted the mission at Shepton Mallet, which he held for the next thirty-nine years. From his arrival until the sisters moved to Westbury near Bristol in 1830, he acted as spiritual director to the adjacent Convent of the Visitation, which undoubtedly stimulated his interest in the history of the order. In 1812 he published a translation of Jacques Marsollier's <span class="italic">Life of St Francis of Sales</span>; this was followed by another translation, <span class="italic">The Spiritual Entertainments of St Francis of Sales</span> (1814), which he dedicated to the Visitation sisters. In 1830 he published his own <span class="italic">History of the Life of St Jane Frances de Chantal</span>. He also published a polemical work, <span class="italic">The Essence of Religious Controversy</span> (1827), and a protest about those clauses in the 1829 <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> which related to monastic institutions. In June 1849 he retired to Downside Abbey, where he remained until his death on 15 November 1850. He was buried in the Downside cemetery. Little is known of his character, although the vicar of Camerton, the irascible John Skinner, recorded that Coombes caused &#145;much unnecessary trouble&#146; over the collection of his uncle's tithes in 1807  (Coombs, 262). Lady Jerningham, who became acquainted with Coombes in Bath in 1808, described him as &#145;A good Grecian and clever, agreable [<i>sic</i>] also and pious. Not conceited, always wears spectacles&#146;  (E. Castle, ed., <span class="italic">The Jerningham Letters</span>, 1896, 1.326).<br>
