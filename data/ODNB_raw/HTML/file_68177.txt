<span class="headword">Lloyd,  David</span>  (1656&#150;1731), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in America</span>, was born at Manafon, Montgomeryshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71100/', "Thomas Lloyd (1640&#150;1694)")</script>. Having left grammar school in the 1670s he trained under the infamous George Jeffreys. From the 1680s he was legal adviser to William Penn, at that time managing the colony of Pennsylvania, and he converted to Quakerism in 1692. Under Penn he was responsible for drawing up deeds, warrants, and sundry documents for the colony's purchasers. Having moved to Pennsylvania in 1686 he became the colony's first attorney-general. Although he held other offices throughout his career&#151;for instance as a member of the assembly and of the provincial council, and as clerk of the Philadelphia county court&#151;it was his superb legal abilities that were his making and his undoing. His aim to increase Pennsylvanian autonomy brought him into conflict with its deputy governors and, finally, with Penn.<br>
<br>Although Lloyd remained in Pennsylvania for the rest of his life his prominence in the colony's politics involved him in imperial affairs. Elected to the general assembly in 1693, when the proprietorship of Pennsylvania was taken over by Benjamin Fletcher, he played a significant role in the review and negotiations to bring the colony's laws in line with English law. He was also at the forefront in writing a petition to William III protesting against Anglican attempts at overthrowing Quaker hegemony. In 1698 he emerged as the ablest defender against charges made by the surveyor-general, Edmund Randolph, that Pennsylvania was not enforcing the navigation laws and was, as a result, colluding with smuggling. Moreover he was accused by the vice-Admiralty judge Robert Quary of defying the order of the crown in open court and of having &#145;affronted his Majty in their open Court&#146; by ridiculing the king's picture  (<span class="italic">Papers of William Penn</span>, 3.572). This last incident resulted in an order from the Board of Trade demanding the removal of the colony's deputy governor, William Markham, a justice of the peace, Anthony Morris, and particularly David Lloyd &#145;not only from the place of Attorney General, but from all public Imployments whatsoever&#146;  (ibid., 3.576&#150;7). His removal embittered him against Penn, whom he blamed for not defending his fellow Quakers against the likes of Randolph and Quary. Earlier Lloyd had been responsible, as an assemblyman, for drafting a petition demanding changes in the land policy and the regulation of drinking-houses. He also drafted the new frame of government (1696) in an effort to diminish the power of the Philadelphia merchants, who were seen as a conduit for British control. However, from 1698 all Lloyd's efforts were directed against Penn, whom he accused of lying and of undermining the government of the colony, and he opposed Penn's efforts to sell the right of government to the crown. His opposition to Penn did not deter his re-election to the assembly, his election as its speaker, or his appointment as recorder for Philadelphia. His fight against Penn was given an added boost when he was recruited by the Ford family as their agent in their suit against the proprietor. The appointment gave Lloyd power to prohibit Penn from selling land and collecting quitrents, thus weakening the proprietor's bargaining position with the crown.<br>
<br>Lloyd's fortunes changed when the 1710 elections resulted in his removal from government. Though he was elected to subsequent assemblies he no longer played as powerful a role in politics. Nevertheless he continued to promote Pennsylvania's government over British law. In 1725 he issued <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Legislative Power</span>, in which he criticized proprietary attempts to revive the role of the provincial council as a second chamber. It was also part of an ongoing attack against Penn's agent, James Logan, who condemned the unicameral assembly conceded by Penn in 1701. Logan accused Lloyd of being hypocritical in his legal judgments. He was not above compromising his defence of the colonial rights when he negotiated the passage of the <span class="roman">Affirmation Act</span> through the assembly. In doing so he introduced English statutes enacting the death penalty for minor crimes. In turn Lloyd denounced Logan as &#145;an Evil Minister, and ungrateful Servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers of William Penn</span>, 3.502).<br>
<br>Though Lloyd intended to retire from politics the feud with Logan and the critical issue of paper money saw him stand for office and returned as member for Chester county in 1725. By this time he was in his sixties. His last years were spent in a number of roles. He remained chief justice of Pennsylvania (to which he had been appointed in 1717) and participated in the state supreme court. At the same time he acted as recorder of Chester county. He kept his ties with the Society of Friends as an archivist for the Philadelphia yearly meeting, where he collected historical records. He also edited and promoted the publication of books from Europe. His encouragement in the literary sphere was recognized by the Baptist minister Abel Morgan, who dedicated the first Welsh concordance of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to him. Lloyd, who died at Chester, Pennsylvania, on 6 April 1731, was twice married. Details of his first wife, Sarah (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1661), are unknown; his second wife, Grace Growdon, whom he married in 1697, survived him.<br>
