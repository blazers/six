<span class="headword">Glover,  Thomas Blake</span>  (1838&#150;1911), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 6 June 1838 at 15 Commerce Street, Fraserburgh, in Aberdeenshire, the fifth of the eight children of Thomas Berry Glover (1805&#150;1878), a civilian chief officer of the coastguard at Fraserburgh, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Findley (1807&#150;1887), of Fordyce, Banffshire. He probably attended the parish school at Fraserburgh, and his name appears on the register of Channonry House School (The Gymnasium), Old Aberdeen, for the year 1854.<br>
<br>Glover arrived in Nagasaki via Shanghai on 19 September 1859, soon after the opening of Japan to foreign trade. In May 1861 he became established as a general commission agent, representing among others Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., and in February 1862 he formed Glover &amp; Co. At first he mainly exported refined Japanese tea, but this was not profitable.<br>
<br>Glover's fortunes began to change in late 1863, when he started to take advantage of the business opportunities offered by the domestic political rivalries of late Tokugawa Japan. With funds loaned from Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., he switched his major interests to more speculative activities, such as the sale of ships, and arms and ammunition. Glover &amp; Co. became the biggest Western firm in Nagasaki, opening branches in Shanghai and Yokohama in 1864. In 1865 Glover ordered munitions from Armstrong &amp; Co. on behalf of the shogunate; he sold ships and even arranged for some domains to have ships built in Britain. Such orders were generally made through Glover Brothers, the Aberdeen firm of his brother Charles (1830&#150;1877).<br>
<br>Glover later claimed that he had been the most rebellious of all the rebels against the Tokugawa shogunate. Although he had dealings with the shogunate, and there is no contemporary evidence as to his political convictions, his links with the Satsuma domain did grow closer as it developed an increasingly pro-trade and pro-British stance. He arranged for young samurai from Satsuma, some of whom played prominent roles in the early Meiji government, to study in England in 1865, and persuaded Sir Harry Parkes to visit the capital of Satsuma in July 1866.<br>
<br>Ironically, Glover &amp; Co. found it difficult to adjust to the changes in trade which occurred with the Meiji restoration of 1868, including the economic decline of Nagasaki. Glover attempted to shift to entrepreneurial activities, constructing a patent slip dock and developing the Takashima coalmine. He also started branches in the newly opened Hyogo and Osaka, anticipating good trading prospects. However, he was seriously undercapitalized and his new ventures did not produce results quickly enough. The firm was declared bankrupt in August 1870 and the Netherland Trading Society acted as trustees. This failure is attributable to a lack of managerial ability, probably linked to his optimistic outlook on life, as well as to the disappearance of the circumstances which had earlier brought him prosperity. After the bankruptcy he continued to work at the Takashima coalmine, which was eventually bought by Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi was founded by Yataro Iwasaki, a former Tosa samurai, who had had business dealings with Glover before the restoration. Glover acted as a consultant for Mitsubishi in various ways, playing a crucial role in the founding of what became the Kirin Brewery Company.<br>
<br>Glover was married, probably in 1867, to Tsuru Awajiya (1848&#150;1899), who is said to have been one of the models for Arthur de Long's &#147;Madam Butterfly&#148;. Although this story was the inspiration behind Puccini's opera, Tsuru was never a geisha and it is unlikely that the character of Lieutenant Pinkerton was based on Glover. They had two children, Hana (1868&#150;1938) and Tomisaburo (1870&#150;1945). In 1908 he was awarded the order of the Rising Sun (second class) by the Japanese emperor for his contribution to the establishment of the Meiji government.<br>
<br>Glover's residence in Nagasaki became a famous tourist spot and he remains a well-known historical figure in Japan, although his role in the Meiji restoration has been exaggerated. He is criticized for his arms-dealing activities and praised for his attempts to introduce Western technology. In Britain his behind-the-scenes role in liaising with anti-shogunate domains before the restoration was valued by Lord Redesdale, a diplomatic contemporary  (Redesdale, 377), but he was largely forgotten. In the late 1980s, however, local historians in the Aberdeen area, aware of his fame in Japan, began to revive his memory. Glover died of Bright's disease on 16 December 1911 at his home, 8 Fujimi-cho, Azabu, Tokyo. He was buried at Sakamoto international cemetery in Nagasaki beside his wife, Tsuru.<br>
