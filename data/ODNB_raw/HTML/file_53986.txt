<span class="headword">Carmichael,  Alexander</span>  (1832&#150;1912), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born on 1 December 1832 and baptized on 8 December on the island of Lismore, in western Argyll; his parents were Hugh Carmichael and his wife, Betty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacColl. The Carmichaels were a family of long standing in Lismore, and an earlier Bishop Carmichael, known as An t-Easbaig B&agrave;n (&#145;the fair-haired bishop&#146;), is referred to as a remote relative. Carmichael entered the civil service, and worked in the customs and excise division, with periods of service in Greenock, Dublin, Islay, Cornwall, Skye, Uist, Oban, Uist again, and finally Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Carmichael seems to have been deeply interested in collecting Gaelic lore from his early years, and he continued to make collecting expeditions well into his seventies. Several of his main working locations provided excellent opportunities for his collecting, and he made expeditions to other Gaelic areas (such as Lewis and Sutherland). He married Mary Frances MacBean (<i>b</i>. 1841)) on 13 January 1868, and they lived on South Uist in the outer isles until 1882, when they moved to Edinburgh. Mary Carmichael was greatly supportive of her husband's work, and contributed to the artistic presentation of his main work, <span class="italic">Carmina Gadelica</span>. She was not a Gaelic speaker but their children were.<br>
<br>During the family's Edinburgh years the Carmichael home was regarded as a centre of Gaelic-related activity, and Carmichael was widely admired by younger contemporaries such as the Revd Donald Lamont and the Revd Kenneth MacLeod, both well known for their Gaelic literary work. Part of MacLeod's vivid portrait of Carmichael may be quoted:<blockquote>Year in year out, for nearly sixty years, Dr Carmichael was on pilgrimage throughout Gaeldom. To many of us he seemed, both in temperament and in activity, as one of the Iona brethren re-born in the nineteenth century. His very appearance was suggestive of Iona: the stately and venerable figure undoubtedly was, while the Scots bonnet might easily be mistaken for a biretta, the shepherd's crook for a pastoral staff, and the long dark cloak half-concealing the kilt, for a monk's habit. (<span class="italic">Celtic Review</span>, October 1912)</blockquote>Carmichael's daughter Elizabeth Catherine (Ella) [<a name="cosubject_53986"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Catherine Watson</span>  (1870&#150;1928)<span class="occ"></span>] was born on 9 August 1870 and played an important part in the Edinburgh Gaelic world, helping to found Gaelic societies and a Gaelic choir. Donald Lamont recalls her as a very attractive fellow student in the 1890s, and she acted as editor of the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span> from 1904 to 1916. In 1906 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53990/', "William John Watson")</script>, who became professor of Celtic at Edinburgh University; their son, James Carmichael Watson, succeeded his father in 1938, but was killed in 1942 during the Second World War. Ella herself died on 30 November 1928. The Carmichael dynasty in Edinburgh was a distinguished one, but all too brief.<br>
<br>It is notable that Alexander Carmichael contributed at an early stage to the collections of J. F. Campbell of Islay, including his <span class="italic">Popular Tales of the West Highlands</span> (1860&#150;62) and his collection of heroic and Ossianic balladry, <span class="italic">Leabhar na F&egrave;inne</span> (1872). He supplied Gaelic proverbs for Sheriff Nicolson's collection (1881) and contributed several papers to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</span> (with drawings by Mary Carmichael). For W. F. Skene's <span class="italic">Celtic Scotland</span> he wrote a chapter on old highland land customs, and was later asked to write a more elaborate paper for the crofter royal commission report. He contributed frequently to periodicals and papers such as <span class="italic">An Gaidheal</span>, <span class="italic">The Highlander</span>, the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>. Alexander Carmichael died at his home, 15 Barnton Terrace, Edinburgh, on 6 June 1912, and was buried on Lismore.<br>
<br>Carmichael's overwhelming achievement was the collection of material which resulted in the volumes of <span class="italic">Carmina Gadelica</span>. The central core of this work is an extensive collection of runes, prayers, invocations, work songs, and so on, which touch on virtually all aspects of Gaelic communal and private life. Some aspects of that life were, of course, affected, undermined, or lost before Carmichael's time, but his patient and intimate searches often brought him into contact with some of the last repositories of ancient tradition, especially in the outer isles. This body of lore had many different aspects and sources. Some of it was securely embedded in Christian belief, often related to the early Celtic church and its saints; other items have a pagan resonance, and many grew out of the natural habitat, with its flowers, herbs, animals, weather, and seasonal changes. A short summary of the categories of the collection gives some idea of its range and flavour: prayers; seasonal hymns; addresses to the saints; blessings for household or other tasks, such as reaping, milking, and herding; incantations or charms to cure ailments such as toothache, jaundice, and indigestion; prayers to the sun and moon; blessings on stock; and waulking songs.<br>
<br>Only a very small number of these verses have ascribed authors, but it is clear from internal evidence that they originated in different parts of Gaelic Scotland, and were of both oral and literary origin. Some were presumably composed by clerics, and many by ordinary members of the community. A number of the hymns are Gaelic versions of well-known Catholic hymns. It is likely that some of the pieces had their origins in the middle ages and probably earlier. The highest rate of survival seems to have been in Catholic communities which in Carmichael's day still retained an undiluted Gaelic ethos.<br>
<br>The first two volumes of <span class="italic">Carmina Gadelica</span> appeared in 1900, with translations and annotations by Alexander Carmichael. They have a high incidence of unusual words and expressions, and some of the translations are guesswork. There is also some suspicion that the Gaelic texts were over-edited by Carmichael, and supplemented where there were gaps. These two volumes were reissued in 1928, with some light editing by Ella Carmichael, and volumes 3 and 4 appeared in 1940&#150;41, edited by J. C. Watson, the collector's grandson. Volume 5, consisting of songs rather than runes and prayers, appeared in 1954 and was edited by Angus Matheson, who also edited volume 6 (1971), consisting mainly of glossaries and indexes. In 1992 a volume was published that consisted of the translations only, with an informative preface by John Macinnes. In the later part of the twentieth century the translated versions developed a cult following.<br>
<br>Soon after the publication of the first two volumes suspicions arose that Carmichael, evidently an admirer of James MacPherson's Ossianic work, was prone to polishing and perhaps romanticizing some of the <span class="italic">Carmina</span>. In 1976 Hamish Robertson published &#145;Studies in Carmichael's <i>Carmina Gadelica</i>&#146; in <span class="italic">Scottish Gaelic Studies</span>, volume 12. This exposes some of Carmichael's dubious practices, and suggests that Watson was less rigorous than might have been expected in dealing with this problem. John L. Campbell, in an article in the same journal (vol. 13, 1978), rebuts some of Robertson's criticism, and John Macinnes gives his assessment in his preface to the 1992 edition. In sum, there appears to have been interference with both Gaelic texts and translations, but this does not seem to undermine crucially the wide-ranging and fascinating collection of verse lore which Carmichael rescued in the final decades of its secure existence.<br>
