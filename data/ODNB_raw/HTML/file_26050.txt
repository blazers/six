</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Southcott,  Joanna</span>  (1750&#150;1814), <span class="occ">prophet and writer</span>, was born on 25 April 1750 in Taleford, near Ottery St Mary, Devon, the fourth of six children, and was raised in the village of Gittisham, 16 miles from Exeter. Her father, William Southcott (<i>d</i>. 1802), was a tenant farmer, and her mother, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Godfrey (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1770), was the daughter of a respectable farmer from Ottery St Mary. William, who continued to be aggrieved over his grandfather's loss of the Southcott family estate in Herefordshire, instilled in his daughter a strong sense of pride in her ancestry and in the quality of her work, however humble. As a girl, Joanna developed a lifelong habit of reading scripture and interpreting everyday events within a spiritual frame. Although inclined when about twenty to high spirits and a taste for pretty clothes and romance, she promised her dying mother that she would commit herself to a life of piety. During her twenties and thirties, Southcott held various positions in different households in and around Exeter, mostly as a farm labourer, maidservant, and upholsterer. Although Southcott did not start publishing her writings until 1801, when she was fifty-one, most of her texts are enlivened by fascinating fragments of village lore and autobiographical detail from her early life in Devon. In <span class="italic">What manner of communications are these?</span> (1804) she recalls various encounters with desirable suitors (and at least one impudent footman) in order to elaborate on the intricate progress of her spiritual life; this is evident in the story of her first boyfriend, Noah Bishop, the farmer's son from Sidmouth, whom she teased and rejected for some time, about 1768, before regaining her holy bearings (pp. 27&#150;40; Seymour, 1.143&#150;52). The more dramatic experiences of others could also be turned to similar effect. For example, when questioned on the propriety of including such materials in her books, especially the racy ballad of Lord Burnet's discovery and murder of his wife's lover in their marriage bed (now known as the &#145;Ballad of Mattie Groves&#146;), Southcott was convinced that even this narrative could be transformed into a spiritual sign that the Lord would return in just fury against the nation that had betrayed him with Satan.<h2>
<a name="Originsofavisionary"></a>Origins of a visionary</h2>Southcott's millenarian visions first began in 1792 when she was forty-two years old. Day and night, she was spoken to by a &#145;voice&#146; predicting what would happen on earth, from the coming war in France to food shortages in the west country. These communications first happened while she was working in the household of the Taylors, who found it to their profit, both materially and spiritually, to heed her providential advice to lay in stores. Along with other Exeter witnesses, Lucy Taylor later corroborated Southcott's claim that a number of her predictions had come true during the 1790s  (<span class="italic">The Trial of Joanna Southcott</span>, 1804, 59&#150;60). To prove the authenticity of her mission, Southcott developed the bold stratagem of sealing her prophecies and sending them to clergymen or other dignitaries, so that her predictions could be tested against future events. In her first book, <span class="italic">The Strange Effects of Faith</span> (1801), she recounts her persistent efforts (between 1792 and 1800) to have her prophetic role and the truth of her visions examined and accredited by the clergy. She accuses the religious leaders she approached&#151;including a Methodist (John Eastlake), a Calvinist-Methodist (Henry Tanner), a dissenter (Mr Leach), and an Anglican (Joseph Pomeroy)&#151;of returning or burning her letters, of belittling her humble station and bad handwriting, and of forbidding her to publish her writings, even though she had been ordered to do so by her &#145;voice&#146;. Southcott saw herself as appointed to speak for the poor and working classes during a time of war and crisis, when their acute distress was being ignored by the clergy and the privileged classes. Typically, in a letter dated 23 March 1800, she attacks the Revd Pomeroy, vicar of St Kew, Cornwall, who had at first heard her petitions with respect, for his proud indifference: &#145;I hear the cries of the poor, complaining they are starving to death, for want of food&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copies of Letters Sent to the Clergy of Exeter</span>, 1813, 27). Her confidence grew, as did her local fame, when her predictions&#151;regarding the date of the death of Bishop Buller of Exeter in December 1796, and the crop failures and ensuing famines of 1799 and 1800&#151;were fulfilled.<br>
<br>Finally, in 1801, weary of admonishing the local clergy to no avail, Southcott used up her life savings, supplemented by loans, to print 1000 copies of the first part of her book, <span class="italic">The Strange Effects of Faith; with Remarkable Prophecies (Made in 1792)</span>, five more parts of which were published by the end of 1802. This first work attracted the attention of some followers of the prophet Richard Brothers, who had been at the height of his influence about 1795, when his extravagant warnings&#151;for example, that George III must surrender his crown to Brothers as God's chosen one&#151;led to an eleven-year incarceration for insanity (1795&#150;1806). In December 1801 six followers of Brothers and a seventh man (Peter Morrison, a cotton printer from Liverpool) travelled to Exeter to examine the new prophet's credibility. The seven stars, as Southcott called her judges, included three Anglican clergymen: Stanhope Bruce, vicar of Inglesham; Thomas Webster, a London cleric; and Thomas Philip Foley, rector of Old Swinford near Stourbridge, Worcestershire, who became one of Southcott's most loyal friends. The other four were Morrison; John Wilson, a coach-maker of Kentish town; George Turner, a merchant of Leeds, who became a prominent regional recruiter; and William Sharp (1749&#150;1824), the master engraver, who later created the best-known portrait of Southcott. By the next year, these men had arranged for Southcott to move to London, where they provided her with lodgings and began to promote her work. The Exeter trial of Southcott's claims was followed by two more public trials; one in a house in Paddington rented by Foley, and the third at Neckinger House, Bermondsey, at the home of Elias Carpenter, a wealthy papermill owner, who was, for a time, a tireless promoter of her mission. By 1803 the nucleus of Brothers's followers had declared their convincement. Southcott had been careful not to attack Brothers and seemed to advocate his release, but once she had secured his main followers, she declared the superiority of her mission. After consolidating her following in London during 1803 and 1804, Southcott went on a missionary tour and was particularly successful in Yorkshire and the west country in attracting people to her stunning promise of a redeemed England in which the true heirs would soon come to possess the land.<h2>
<a name="TheSouthcottianmovement"></a>The Southcottian movement</h2>One of the most significant of her London converts was Jane Townley, who not only invited Southcott, in April 1804, to become part of her household, but also did all she could to promote Southcott's writings and cause, including providing her maidservant, Ann Underwood, to act as Southcott's accomplished and devoted amanuensis. With the steadfast assistance of Foley, Sharp, and others, the three women became the nerve centre for the Southcottian movement, which generated an astonishing degree of interest, correspondence, and debate regarding Southcott's prophetic claims. Between 1801 and 1814, Southcott published some sixty-five pamphlets, totalling almost 5000 pages; moreover, her unpublished manuscripts amount to twice the number of pages in print. By one conservative estimate, a total of 108,000 copies of her various works were published and circulated from 1801 to 1816, making her one of the most popular writers of her time  (Hopkins, 84). One reason for the immediate appeal of her texts is their unique mix of apocalyptic optimism with down-to-earth narratives about everyday life, which she converts to spiritual account. Particularly vivid are her narratives of what it was like to be an unmarried maidservant negotiating the sexual politics of a household. During the early 1780s, she stayed for five years with the Wills family from whom she learned the upholstering trade. Complaining of his adulterous wife, her master Wills had tried to seduce Southcott by declaring his desire to be her Christian lover. She rejected him in no uncertain terms: &#145;no tongue can paint the horror I felt, to hear of love from a married man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copies and Parts of Copies of Letters and Communications, Written &hellip; to Mr W. Sharp</span>, 1804, 18&#150;19). She agreed to stay in his household, however, after Wills arranged to bring a Methodist minister into the house as a lodger to restore moral order. Unfortunately, the lodger turned out to be the charismatic preacher Hugh Saunderson, who violated Wills's trust by seducing the obliging Mrs Wills and by trying to turn the couple's children against their father. Southcott intervened by trying to have the Methodists remove Saunderson from the house without scandal. This ploy proving ineffectual, she was forced to inform Wills directly. Flying into a violent fit, Wills unaccountably accused Southcott of lying and drove her from his household. His malice was so great that he vindictively spread lies to prevent her from obtaining a new position. Her good name being her chief capital, she sued Wills and won the case because, although many false witnesses were paid to defame her, Wills's own son refused to come to bear false witness. Her triumph in going to court and being found trustworthy became a model of success by which her credibility as a prophet could be put to public trial.<br>
<br>Early on, Southcott developed the practice of sealing as a way to bind her scattered followers into one community of believers. The practice entailed drawing a circle on a piece of paper, within which was written a simple message of acceptance; the believer signed at the top, Southcott signed below; then the paper was folded and sealed with Southcott's special seal, which contained two stars and the initials IC (Iesu Christi). Southcott initially cast her sealing net wide, but soon it became a prerequisite that all those wishing to be sealed read two of her booklets, <span class="italic">Sound an Alarm in my Holy Mountain</span> (1804), and <span class="italic">A Caution and Instruction to the Sealed</span> (1807), to familiarize themselves with what was required of the heirs to the new Jerusalem. A safe estimate of the total number of sealed followers achieved by 1815 is around 20,000  (Harrison, 109). The practice also left Southcott open to abuse, as can be seen in the notorious case of the fortune-teller and con-artist Mary Bateman (1768&#150;1809), who obtained one of Southcott's seals in order to capitalize on the spirit of the age. In 1806 Bateman charged admission to see her display of three millennial eggs, hatched from a miraculous hen, inscribed with the message &#145;Christ is Coming&#146;. Bateman defrauded, bullied, and bribed a number of victims from York to Leeds, before being convicted and hanged in 1809 for poisoning one of her clients with arsenic. Southcott eventually denounced not only Bateman, but also the newspapers that malevolently deceived the public by insinuating that Southcott herself was somehow connected to fraud and murder (<span class="italic">A True Picture of the World and a Looking Glass for All Men</span>, 1809?, 7&#150;8; Seymour, 1.243&#150;4).<h2>
<a name="MotherofShiloh"></a>Mother of Shiloh</h2>One key element of Southcott's sect was its insistence that a female figure would bring about millennial change. Similar to Jane Lead and the Philadelphians of the 1690s, Southcott underlined the significance of such biblical passages as <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 3, in which God promises that the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head, and <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 12, in which the Woman clothed in Sun brings about a new order. This point was reinforced also by several strategic visions. In June 1804, full of self-doubt and wounded by the vicious public attacks on her character, Southcott retreated from London to a house in Bristol. She was pacing up and down when the whole house began to shake with her fury and despair, frightening those living with her; Southcott fell into a frenzy&#151;&#145;words flew too fast to utter&#146;&#151;but then she recomposed herself. Her prophetic &#145;voice&#146; asserted that, just as the house trembled, the whole earth would tremble, and powerful men and doubting clergy would fall; then the &#145;voice&#146; re-established Southcott's authority, saying: &#145;I will conquer in woman's form&#146; (<span class="italic">Copies and Parts of Copies of Letters and Communications, Written &hellip; to Mr W. Sharp</span>, 79; Seymour, 1.52). In 1814 Southcott carried the claim to a new level when she announced that she was about to become the mother of Shiloh, the name given to the expected divine incarnation. The revelation was made explicit in <span class="italic">The Third Book of Wonders, Announcing the Coming of Shiloh</span> (1814), and <span class="italic">Prophecies Announcing the Birth of the Prince of Peace</span> (1814), which collected extractions from earlier writings that seemed to anticipate this new revelation. Public incredulity reached new heights in April of that year when it was rumoured that a number of physicians were being called in to examine Southcott's body, which was said to be showing signs of pregnancy, although, as she freely admitted to her doctors, she was a virgin and sixty-four years old. In fact, for believers, the very absurdity of the situation seemed to confirm its miraculous potential. The popular press exploded with laughter and scorn as can be seen in Thomas Rowlandson's cartoon &#145;A Medical Inspection, or, Miracles will Never Cease&#146;, which shows an obese Joanna lifting her skirts to be examined by leering medical men. By November Southcott was overdue, and she was said to be enduring terrible labour pains. In hope that all that was wanting to effect delivery was a legal father, on 12 November 1814 Southcott married John Smith (1758&#150;1829) of Blockley, a respectable friend of her own age and a former steward to the earl of Darnley, who offered himself in the role of Joseph, the adopted father of the expected Shiloh.<br>
<br>The marriage was to be annulled if Shiloh did not appear; however, Southcott died on 27 December 1814 at 38 Manchester Street, London. Given the possibility that she was only in a trance, her body was wrapped in flannel and kept warm for four days. At the time, according to Dr Richard Reece, the engraver William Sharp believed that her body could be resuscitated and Shiloh produced. When Reece protested at such a delusion, Sharp retorted, &#145;Ah, Sir, you take only a <i>professional</i> view of it, but I take a <i>spiritual</i> one&#146;  (Seymour, 2.389). Finally on 31 December an autopsy took place at 38 Manchester Street at which were a number of her followers and several medical men, including James Sims, Joseph Adams, and Richard Reece. Southcott was buried at St John's Wood, Middlesex on 1 January 1815. However, her body continued to be the site of conflicting and confusing interpretations. Dr Mathias, who was also present at the autopsy, sought to give physical explanations for the symptoms of pregnancy in his <span class="italic">The Case of Johanna Southcott</span> (1815): the body, he argued, was already livid and putrid; he found four inches of fat on the abdomen, and glandular enlargement of the breasts; and he blamed the supposed quickness felt in her abdomen on extreme flatus in the intestines. On dissecting the uterus, no foetus was found. Or, as the believers put it, Shiloh had mysteriously disappeared.<br>
<br>After Southcott's death the movement splintered and prophets of Shiloh proliferated, among which John Ward's Shilohites and John Wroe's Christian Israelites were the most prominent. A core of her inner circle kept the faith quietly, remaining loyal to Southcott's work, as signified by their protection of the &#145;great box&#146;, which contained the sealed prophecies that were to be opened some time in the unspecified future by the bishops. The box had been made by William Sharp in 1801 to contain Southcott's prophecies and letters, which were opened at her second and third trials. In 1816 the box was passed to Jane Townley, and upon her death in 1825 to Thomas Philip Foley, and finally in 1835 to Foley's son, the Revd Richard Foley (<i>d</i>. 1861). In 1839, in order to gain control of Southcott's legacy, Lavinia Taylor Jones (niece of Lucy Taylor, Southcott's Exeter employer) dressed as a man to enter Richard Foley's rectory, where she tried to steal the &#145;great box&#146;. Sometime after that, rival boxes began to appear. As recently as 1977, the Panacea Society, a twentieth-century millenarian group dedicated to rehabilitating Southcott's reputation, claimed to know the secret whereabouts of the true box  (Exell, 55&#150;62). In 1966 interest of a different and scholarly sort was enkindled, when E. P. Thompson, in full appreciation of Southcott's working-class origins and enduring appeal, called her England's &#145;greatest prophetess of all&#146;  (Thompson, 382).<br>
