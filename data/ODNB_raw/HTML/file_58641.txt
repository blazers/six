<span class="headword">Dukes,  Charles</span>, Baron Dukeston  (1880&#150;1948), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 28 October 1880 at Bedcote, Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the first child of George Harry Dukes, a spade plater, and his wife, Ann Hatton. After leaving elementary school at the age of eleven he was employed as an errand boy. When he was thirteen his parents moved to Stockton Heath, Warrington, where he worked with his father in an iron forge and then had a series of labouring jobs, including one as a &#145;ripper&#146; with navvies on the Manchester Ship Canal. At the age of seventeen he joined the United Builders' Labourers' Union and later the National Union of Gasworkers and General Labourers&#151;the union which in 1924 became the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). In his early working life he took a leading part in local disputes, which made employers reluctant to employ him, and in 1911 he became full-time secretary of the Gasworkers' Warrington branch, living on commission. In three years he increased the membership from thirty to 3000, and he was appointed district officer in 1915, the year of his marriage to Emily Forster (1879&#150;1969). A tall, imposing figure, &#145;with the voice of a gentle sergeant-major&#146;  (<span class="italic">County Express</span>, 22 May 1948), he was an outstanding organizer and a thoughtful and skilful negotiator. In 1924 he was appointed temporary district secretary for the NUGMW Leeds district and in 1925 he was elected district secretary for Lancashire.<br>
<br>Throughout these years Dukes was active in politics. When he was nineteen he had joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and a year later he was secretary of the Warrington branch. He served on Stockton Heath parish council, was secretary of the Warrington Trades Council and Labour Representation Committee, and fought municipal elections. In 1912 he became a member of the national executive of the newly formed British Socialist Party (BSP), to which members of the ILP left were drawn, and he was among the majority within the BSP who opposed war. In 1916, when conscripted into the Cheshire regiment, he refused to obey military orders, was court-martialled, and served a prison sentence. None the less, in the 1923 general election he became Warrington's first Labour MP, but he lost the seat in the following year's general election. He again represented Warrington in the Commons from 1929 to 1931.<br>
<br>Dukes's election as district secretary for Lancashire in 1925 automatically placed him on the union's national executive, where he rapidly established himself as the dominant force. He supported the decision of the general council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to call off the general strike, and in 1927 vigorously enforced his own union executive's rule against members of the Communist Party or minority movement holding office in the NUGMW. When, in 1933, Will Thorne, the general secretary of the NUGMW since 1889, announced his impending retirement, Dukes was the obvious successor; following his election he took office in 1934. Between 1936 and 1938 he carried through a much needed reorganization of the union, bringing in compulsory retirement at sixty-five for full-time officers, redrawing the boundaries of the union's districts, abolishing the office of president, and enhancing the authority of national officers. Under his leadership the NUGMW was on the right of labour politics.<br>
<br>The general secretaryship gave Dukes a seat on the general council of the TUC, where, after Ernest Bevin and Walter Citrine, he was recognized as its strongest personality. After Bevin became minister of labour in 1940 it was Dukes who moved many of the council's most important resolutions during the war. He was made a CBE in 1942. In 1945&#150;6 he was president of the TUC. Following his retirement from the general secretaryship of the NUGMW in 1946 he received a peerage in the new year's honours in 1947, and was later appointed a director of the Bank of England. His career epitomizes that of many trade union leaders of his generation who, in their early days, combined militant political views with trade union activism and then, as their trade union responsibilities increased and they experienced the inter-war depression and the failure of the general strike, became political moderates.<br>
<br>Dukes died from a lympho sarcoma in Granard House Royal Cancer Hospital on 14 May 1948, and was buried in St Leonard's churchyard, Chesham Bois, near Amersham, on 19 May. He left no heir and his barony became extinct.<br>
