<span class="headword">Warburton,  Peter Egerton</span>  (1813&#150;1889), <span class="occ">explorer in Australia</span>, was the fourth son of the Revd Rowland Egerton Warburton (1778&#150;1846) of Arley Hall, Northwich, Cheshire, and his wife, Emma (1782&#150;1881), the daughter of John Croxton and the granddaughter and sole heir of Sir Peter Warburton of Warburton and Arley, Cheshire. Peter was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28678/', "Rowland Eyles Egerton Warburton")</script> and was born at Arley Hall on 16 August 1813. After being educated at Orl&eacute;ans and Paris, he enlisted in the navy in 1825. Having served over three years, he entered the Royal Indian Military College, Addiscombe, in 1829; he became an ensign in the 13th native infantry battalion of the Bombay army on 9 June 1831, and after service in India was promoted lieutenant on 18 July 1837. On 8 October 1838 he married Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1892), the daughter of Henry Mant of Bath. They had three sons and three daughters. One of their sons was his second in command in his later journey of exploration. Warburton was promoted captain on 24 January 1845 and served as deputy adjutant-general for some time. In 1853 he retired with the brevet rank of major, intending to settle in New Zealand. Ultimately he chose South Australia instead, and arrived in Adelaide in September of that year. Almost at once he was appointed commissioner of police for South Australia. This office gave him the opportunity to explore little-known districts in the arid centre of South Australia and lakes Eyre and Torrens. In 1866 he discovered a large river, since named after him, which he traced from Lake Eyre north to near the Queensland border. In 1867, after a secret court of inquiry, the government suggested Warburton resign his position. When he refused he was dismissed. A later board could find no justification for his dismissal, but he was not reinstated despite its recommendation, and had to be content with the less well paid post of chief staff officer and the rank of colonel of the volunteer force of South Australia, which he accepted in 1869.<br>
<br>In 1872 Warburton was selected by the government of South Australia to command an expedition to open up overland communication between that colony and Western Australia. When the project was abandoned by the government and taken up by two colonists, Thomas Elder and Walter Hughes, Warburton remained in command. He left Adelaide on 21 September 1872, and Beltana station on the 26th, travelling northward with sixteen camels and supplies. After he arrived at Alice Springs on 21 December 1872 he found the country suffering from drought, and decided to wait there for the rains; but he was disappointed. He started westward for the serious work of his expedition on 15 April 1873, but was in trouble for want of water on the 20th, which, with the extreme heat, caused constant anxiety. Making for the rivers Hugh and Finke in the direction of their supposed courses, he found that they were wrongly mapped. He reached Central Mount Wedge on 8 May, and soon afterwards Table Mountain. About 20 August he had attained Augustus Gregory's farthest point. The expedition continued across the arid terrain, short of food and water, losing their camels, until on 11 December they struck the Oakover River, about 200 miles from the Western Australian coast. On 30 December they were relieved by settlers from Roeborne, which they reached on 26 January 1874. They were the first explorers to cross the continent from the centre to the west and to survive a crossing of the Great Sandy Desert and nearly 1000 miles of country hitherto unknown to Europeans. On their return to Adelaide they were entertained at a public banquet, at which Warburton, who had lost the sight of one eye, attributed his survival to his Aborigine companion Charlie. The legislative assembly voted him &pound;1000, and the Royal Geographical Society awarded him their gold medal for 1874.<br>
<br>In 1875 Warburton was created CMG, elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and published his <span class="italic">Journey across the Western Interior of Australia</span> (with introduction and additions by C. M. Eden and edited by H. W. Bates). He retired from the post of colonel commandant of volunteers in 1877 and took charge of the imperial pensions establishment. He lived at Norley Bank, Beaumont, near Adelaide, where he died on 5 November 1889, survived by his widow and two sons and a daughter. He was buried in the churchyard of St Matthew's, Kensington.<br>
