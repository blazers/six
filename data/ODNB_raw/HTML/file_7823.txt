<span class="headword">Donnelly, Sir  Ross</span>  (<em>c.</em>1761&#150;1840), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Dr Donnelly. After serving under Vice-Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot on the coast of North America, and at the capture of Charlestown, South Carolina, in May 1780, he was promoted on the Newfoundland station as lieutenant of the sloop <i>Morning Star</i> on 27 September 1781. After the peace of Versailles (September 1783) he served as mate in the East India Company's service, but returned to the navy in 1793, and was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Montagu</i> (74 guns); he commanded the ship in Lord Howe's battle of 1 June 1794 in the north Atlantic after the death of her captain, James Montagu. As Howe expressed approval of his conduct and Sir Alexander Hood (Lord Bridport) wrote him a complimentary letter, Donnelly and his friends expected some more marked acknowledgement of his service than the promotion to commander's rank, which, together with the other first lieutenants of the ships engaged, he received on 6 July 1794. He had hoped (and applied) for the gold medal given to some of the flag officers and captains, but was told that it was given only to those who were post captains at the date of the battle. This rule was afterwards modified, and, after both the Nile and Trafalgar, first lieutenants who succeeded to the command by the death of their captains received the gold medal. Donnelly was, however, promoted captain on 24 June 1795, and appointed to the frigate <i>Pegasus</i> (28 guns), in the North Sea with Admiral Duncan. From her he was moved to the <i>Maidstone</i> off the French coast, in which, in 1801, he brought home a valuable convoy of 120 merchant ships from Porto&#151;a service for which the merchants of Porto presented him with a handsome piece of plate. Towards the end of the year he was moved to the <i>Narcissus</i> (32 guns), which for the next three years he commanded in the Mediterranean, attached to the fleet under Nelson. Nelson had a high opinion of him, placing his own relative, W. B. Suckling, and several other young men in whom he was interested under Donnelly's immediate care. He wrote to one father, &#145;Your son cannot be anywhere so well placed as with Donnelly&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). In 1805, still in the <i>Narcissus</i>, he accompanied Sir Home Riggs Popham to the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards to Buenos Aires, whence he returned to England with dispatches, in which his individual services were highly commended both by Popham and the general in command of the troops. He was then appointed to the <i>Ardent</i> (64 guns), and went back to the River Plate in command of a convoy of transports. At the capture of Montevideo he commanded the naval brigade, and rendered important service both in transporting the heavy guns and in erecting batteries. In 1808 Donnelly was appointed to the <i>Invincible</i> (74 guns), in which he joined the squadron off Cadiz, and, later on, the main fleet off Toulon under Lord Collingwood.<br>
<br>In 1810 cataracts in his eyes forced Donnelly to resign his command. Two years later he had so far recovered as to apply for employment again, and he was appointed to the new <i>Devonshire</i> (74 guns), which he fitted out. The conclusion of peace, however, prevented her going to sea, and Donnelly had no further service, though he was promoted rear-admiral on 4 June 1814, vice-admiral on 27 May 1825, and admiral on 28 June 1838; he was made a KCB on 28 February 1837. He died on 30 September 1840. He was married and had children; his eldest daughter, Anne Jane (<i>d</i>. 1855), married, on 18 April 1816, George John, twentieth Baron Audley.<br>
