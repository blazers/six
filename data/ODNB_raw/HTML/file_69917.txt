<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Alexander, of Dunyvaig and the Glens</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1536<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">clan chief</span>, was the eldest son of John Cannoch or Cattenach MacDonald (<i>d</i>. 1499) of Dunyvaig and the Glens, and his wife, Cecilia Savage. His father, who was hanged with his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54283/', "Sir John MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens")</script>, and two of his brothers on James IV's orders in 1499, had been the heir to the chieftainship of the clan Iain Mh&ograve;ir, also known as the clan Donald south, the senior and most powerful of the cadet lines of the clan Donald. The clan had important holdings on both sides of the North Channel, in Kintyre and Islay in western Scotland, and the Glens of Antrim in Ulster. Alexander took refuge in the latter after his father's death, while his inheritance in Islay was granted to Sir John MacIan of Ardnamurchan, who had captured John Cannoch and his sons in 1494. Alexander MacDonald is said to have defeated an expedition by MacIan into Ulster, but he remained there and established a formidable reputation as a leader of the Scottish mercenaries who flocked to Ireland from the Hebrides in the sixteenth century. He settled his feud with John MacIan and married the latter's daughter Caitirfhiona (or Katherine), with whom he had nine sons (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69919/', "James MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17465/', "Sorley Boy MacDonnell")</script>) and two daughters.<br>
<br>Following the battle of Flodden in 1513 Alexander MacDonald's forfeiture was remitted. His marriage had brought him into the orbit of the earls of Argyll, the crown's principal agents in filling the power vacuum left by the disappearance of the lordship of the Isles. On 7 March 1516 &#145;Alexander Johne Caynachis sone&#146; was described as one of the &#145;familiaris and servandis to Coline erle of Ergile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Registrum secreti sigilli</span>, no. 2722). But his reconciliation with MacIan did not last long. By March 1517 Alexander was supporting the bid by Donald Gallda MacDonald of Lochalsh to gain the lordship of the Isles, and later that year they came upon MacIan at Craiganairgid in Morvern and defeated and killed him. Donald died without an heir in 1519, and Alexander became the leading MacDonald in the Isles.<br>
<br>By now the central government was aware of the need to win Alexander MacDonald over. On 13 March 1517 the council recorded its awareness that the clan Iain Mh&ograve;ir was in revolt &#145;because thai have na heritage&#146;  (Hannay, 80), and proposed that if Alexander agreed to submit and give hostages for good behaviour he should be given a renewed remission and a grant of lands. Following the death of Donald Gallda he made his peace and recovered his inheritance in Kintyre and Islay, on condition that his followers &#145;keep guid reule and mak na extorsioun on the Kingis liegis, gevand plegis sufficient&#146;  (Macdonald and Macdonald, 2.516). Alexander also had to settle with the Campbells, and in 1520 he entered into a bond of gossipry and manrent with Sir John Campbell of Cawdor, a younger brother of the third earl of Argyll, whereby Campbell leased to MacDonald lands in Islay and Jura and the island of Colonsay. Although relations between the two men soon became strained, there is evidence that the king's government accepted MacDonald as <i>de facto</i> lord of the Isles at this time.<br>
<br>The re-establishment of the clan Iain Mh&ograve;ir threatened the position of Lachlan Cattanach Maclean, the pre-eminent islander since 1493, and Alexander MacDonald gained most from Lachlan's murder in 1523, but even more important to Alexander were his relations with the Campbells and with the king. In 1528 he went into rebellion once more. In that year James V assumed power, and Argyll was made his lieutenant in the west, where the king had ordered the annulment of recent infeftments of crown lands. The beneficiaries of these had included Alexander MacDonald, and their revocation must have been a principal cause of his revolt, reinforced by his suspicion of Argyll's ambitions. An expedition against the Isles in 1529 was cut short by the earl's death. Summoned before the king MacDonald did not appear, but as preparations were made for a royal expedition he came to James at Stirling in June 1531 and submitted, on terms which included handing over his son James as a hostage. He was rewarded with &pound;100 and a purple velvet gown. Soon afterwards the fourth earl of Argyll accused him of &#145;divers and sindry greit faltis&#146;  (Cameron, 234), but MacDonald appeared before the council in November to answer them, and when Argyll did not attend presented his own complaints against the earl, who was subsequently dismissed as chamberlain of Kintyre.<br>
<br>In 1532, in a westward extension of that year's Anglo-Scottish hostilities, MacDonald led 7000 men to Ulster, and spent most of the rest of his life there. In 1533 he and Hector Maclean of Duart attacked the Isle of Man and captured an English ship, the <i>Mary Willoughby</i>, which they handed over to King James. The king sent bows and arrows to MacDonald, who, however, was also active on his own behalf, to the extent that on 30 August 1535 he was outlawed for a piratical attack on a Glasgow merchant's ships off the Mull of Kintyre. No further action followed, perhaps because MacDonald died in 1536, as stated in the annals of Ulster, or because MacDonald was reconciled with the crown; he may have been the Alexander mentioned in a letter from Archbishop John Allen of Dublin as active in the service of James V in 1538. He was dead by 1539, when his son James was described as &#145;of Dunyvaig&#146;.<br>
