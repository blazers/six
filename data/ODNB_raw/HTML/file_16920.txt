<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lodge,  Edmund</span>  (1756&#150;1839), <span class="occ">herald and biographer</span>, was born on 13 June 1756, in Poland Street, London, the only surviving son of the Revd Edmund Lodge (<i>c</i>.1729&#150;1781), rector of Carshalton in Surrey, and his wife, Mary Garrard, the daughter and sole heir of Richard Garrard of Carshalton. Nothing is known of Lodge's early life or schooling until the age of sixteen, when, on 29 November 1771, he was commissioned as cornet in His Majesty's Own (or 3rd) regiment of dragoons under the command of the earl of Albemarle. This may have been a precipitant decision, for Lodge was not happy in the army: the regiment report records his request for &#145;Leave to sell out&#146; on 3 October 1772  (troop record, TNA: PRO, WO/12/564) and his resignation, one week later, on 11 October 1772. After this set-back, Lodge was slow to decide what path to follow. It was not until 22 February 1782 that he obtained the post of Bluemantle pursuivant-at-arms, one of the four lowest positions, in the College of Arms&#151;the ancient institution which functions as the official guardian and authenticator of pedigrees and armorial bearings. He was to spend the rest of his career as a herald and a genealogist. He rose through the ranks of the College of Arms, becoming Lancaster herald on 29 October 1793 and Norroy king of arms on 11 June 1822. His career as a herald was crowned when he was promoted to Clarenceux king of arms, the second in command at the College of Arms, on 30 July 1838. On 27 April 1808 he married Jane-Anne-Elizabeth Field (<i>d</i>. 1820) at St George the Martyr, Southwark.<br>
<br>In keeping with his antiquarian interests, which are manifest in a herald's work of tracing ancient pedigrees, Lodge was also elected a fellow of the London Society of Antiquaries on 15 March 1787 but, in practice, he made little mark on their proceedings or publications. Instead he developed as an independent antiquarian author working with commercial publishers, such as Harding and Lepard, on a number of luxury periodical publications which combined high quality engraved portrait heads of historical figures with Lodge's authoritative, &#145;pleasant and lucid&#146; accounts of their lives  (<span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, 595). Due to the patriotic fashion for collecting engraved portraits of illustrious figures, most of these lives were of secondary importance to the engravings. This was true of <span class="italic">Imitations of Original Drawings by Hans Holbein</span> (1792), with prints by Francesco Bartolozzi, and of <span class="italic">Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain</span> (1814&#150;34), advertised as &#145;an assemblage of highly furnished Engravings of the Portraits of Persons most distinguished for elevated rank or splendid talents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lodge's Illustrious Portraits</span>, prospectus). Despite the massive cost and extent of this project, which exceeded &pound;40,000 and amounted to forty folio parts, Lodge's &#145;Biographical &amp; historical memoirs&#146; did not go unremarked. In 1828 Sir Walter Scott praised the &#145;vast consequence&#146; of &#145;Mr Lodge's splendid work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portraits &amp; Memoirs</span>, prospectus). Apart from a few literary reviews, including a preface to the works of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, Lodge specialized in such historical memoirs, and, as one commentator explained in the &#145;Advertisement&#146; to the 1849 edition of <span class="italic">Portraits of Illustrious Personages</span>: &#145;it is on the Biographies attached to the &#147;portraits&#148; that his fame chiefly rests, and on them he expended his best energies&#146;. Although Lodge was a prolific author, he was renowned for his painstaking slowness and for missed deadlines.<br>
<br>As well as his formal and ceremonial duties as a herald, and his work at what he called &#145;book-making&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 33929, fol. 26), throughout his career he also took on private commissions to compile family trees; in 1808, for example, he completed one for the Kavenaghs at the apparently modest charge of a guinea. His generous and sociable nature, and his commitment to heraldic research, are further demonstrated by the fact that he was always willing to share his knowledge and do people favours. In a letter to Philip Bliss of 15 March 1814, he explained that: &#145;We of This College, are allowed, by ancient Custom, to make abstracts of Wills in the King's Office, a privilege denied to all other persons, and this fortunately, puts it into my power to save you the expence [<i>sic</i>] of a copy&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34567, fol. 418). Another act of benevolence, which also reflects his elevated reputation in the field of genealogy, was his endorsement of the <span class="italic">Annual Peerage</span> (1827&#150;9), which was published under Lodge's name but was actually the work of Anne, Eliza, and Maria Innes. His literary achievements and public service were honoured when, in 1832, he was appointed a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order of Hanover&#151;an unsolicited distinction that gave Lodge great pleasure.<br>
<br>Lodge died on 16 January 1839 at his house, 2 Bloomsbury Square, London, and was buried at St George's, Bloomsbury, on 24 January. His wife had died in May 1820, and as they had no children most of his estate was left to his unmarried sister, Mary Charlotte Lodge. An enthusiastic bibliophile, Lodge had built up an impressive topographical and heraldic library; this was sold by S. Leigh and Sotheby on 11 March 1839 and, according to their auctioneer's records, raised the sum of &pound;361 4<i>s</i>.6<i>d</i>. Given that his position at the College of Arms made him the protector of the ancient privileges and properties of the aristocracy, it is not surprising that his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> commented on the high-tory bias that tinged all his historical writings. Nevertheless, his works were commended as original, perceptive, and an &#145;ornament to our literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span> [2nd ser.], 11.1, 434).<br>
