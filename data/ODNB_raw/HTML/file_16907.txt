<span class="headword">Lockhart,  William</span> <span class="st"> [created Sir William Lockhart under the protectorate]</span>  (1621?&#150;1675), <span class="occ">diplomat and army officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16903/', "Sir James Lockhart of Lee (1588/1599&#150;1674)")</script> and his second wife, Martha Douglas of Mordington. Unhappy at school at Lanark, he played truant and at the age of thirteen ran away to Leith to sail to the Netherlands and enter the Dutch army. Tall and strong for his age, he was accepted, but soon went on to Danzig, where his relative Sir George Douglas protected him until he died in 1636. Lockhart escorted Douglas's body home from Pomerania, but remained restless and, funded by his mother, travelled across Europe to gain education. Having joined the French army, he caught the queen mother's eye and became captain of horse.<br>
<br>When William Hamilton, earl of Lanark, raised a cavalry regiment for the covenanters in April 1644, Lockhart returned to Scotland as lieutenant-colonel. He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or before 1654), daughter of Sir John Hamilton of Orbiston, justice clerk; they had one son. He served against Montrose and with Leslie in England until Charles I's surrender at Newark. The captive king then knighted him unofficially and used him as his emissary to the duke of Hamilton, to request Hamilton's intervention with the Scottish government on behalf of the defeated Montrose. Lockhart was then appointed commander of a cavalry troop on 29 January 1647 and colonel of horse for Lanarkshire on 4 May, serving on the county committee of war. He fought in the army sent against England under Hamilton in 1648 in support of the engagement with Charles I. First sent to Annan to protect Carlisle from Lambert, he then rejoined Hamilton for the Preston campaign. Unhorsed at Preston, he distinguished himself protecting Hamilton's retreat to Wigan and was one of his three commissioners to negotiate surrender at Uttoxeter. He was sent prisoner to Hull, but secured his release a year later on payment of &pound;1000 and did penance in Scotland for supporting the engagement. His recall to service as general of horse on Charles II's arrival proved abortive, as Argyll sought to constrain him through a joint command with Baillie and Montgomery, and he refused to serve on those terms. When Charles invaded England, he offered his services as a volunteer; rejected, he indignantly declared that &#145;no king on earth should treat him in this manner&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1652 Lockhart threw in his lot with the English and after an interview with Cromwell in London was appointed a commissioner for justice in Scotland in May, subsequently being trusted to help negotiate the Anglo-Scottish Union. He was one of four Scots who sat in the nominated parliament of 1653 and subsequently represented Lancashire in both Oliver Cromwell's parliaments. He sat on the new commission for administering civil justice from June 1654, and was granted Kelso Abbey. His rise owed most to his surprise second marriage, to Cromwell's widowed niece Robina Sewster on 2 July 1654. There were five sons of the marriage, the eldest called Cromwell, and two daughters. Admitted to the Cromwellian &eacute;lite, he was appointed to Cromwell's new Scottish council in May 1655 on a salary of &pound;600 p.a. On 31 August he spoke &#145;very threatening things&#146; to Johnston of Wariston condemning plans of the Protector leadership to promote a new covenant  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Archibald Johnston</span>, 7). He also became JP for Fife, Kinross, and Lanarkshire, and judge of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Following the Anglo-French treaty of October 1655 Cromwell sought alliance with France against Spain, and on 29 February 1656 Lockhart was appointed as ambassador to France on a salary of &pound;120 a month. His &#145;Instructions&#146; required him to arrange a joint campaign in Flanders, preferably financed by France, and to secure protection of Huguenots from Catholic harassment. In France his Presbyterian background and earlier service in the country prompted suspicions about his ability to stir up subversion and he had to form a secret understanding with Mazarin to counteract the deep unpopularity of the negotiations in France, to combat &#145;devot&#146; intrigue for Franco-Spanish peace, and to persuade the cardinal to surrender Dunkirk to Cromwell. Cromwell indicated his confidence by knighting him on 10 December when he reported back to London.<br>
<br>The treaty was signed on 3 March 1657, agreeing a joint campaign against Dunkirk with France financing it and surrendering Gravelines as security if that was recaptured first. Lockhart had to accept the free practice of Catholicism in English-controlled territory, and persuaded Cromwell that this concession was essential for their strategic aims. He duly attended the campaign, taking command of the English force when Sir John Reynolds was drowned, and pressurized the dilatory French to carry out their undertakings. Mardyke, the first conquest, was handed over to the English, but was not properly supplied until Lockhart's protests led Cromwell to threaten withdrawal. On 4 June 1658 Lockhart commanded the English army with distinction at the French victory of the Dunes, leading them in a courageous charge up a sandhill, and on Dunkirk's surrender on 15 June he became governor with his own new cavalry regiment added to the garrison. A forceful administrator, he secured local supplies and English military equipment and stopped his zealous troops harassing the Catholic inhabitants. Cromwell sought to use his continental foothold to spread protestantism, and Lockhart secured the services of preachers such as Hugh Peter to assist his chaplain, Fuller, while warning Cromwell &#145;as Rome was not built in a day, so it will not be pulled down&#146;. He continued to maintain good relations with Mazarin and counteract court intrigues, helped to arrange a joint naval expedition to Italy in 1658, and protested at Huguenot sufferings as in Montauban in 1657 and N&icirc;mes in 1658 despite Catholic resentment. He also assisted Cromwell personally in assessing the suitability of Lord Fauconberg as a husband for his daughter Mary.<br>
<br>Cromwell's death saw no great changes, Lockhart continuing to report to Secretary Thurloe, but Richard Cromwell's deposition weakened English power. Lockhart accepted the restored republican regime, as reported to parliament on 18 May 1659, and returned to London. Despite suspicions of his fidelity he was reappointed ambassador in July on &pound;600 a month and was sent to St Jean de Luz to attend the Franco-Spanish peace talks, though the more reliable Major Tobias Bridge served as his deputy in Dunkirk. But England's usefulness had ceased and he was &#145;coldly received&#146;, at least until Booth's rebellion failed. In October the council of state recalled him. Edmund Ludlow met him by chance at Sir Henry Vane's house in November; he &#145;very much lamented the divisions that were amongst us, affirming that if they had not provided an obstruction to him &hellip; we might have had what terms we could have asked for either from France or Spain&#146;. Meeting Monck on his arrival, he was assured of the general's republicanism and back in Dunkirk ordered his officers to accept whatever arrangements parliament decided. Accordingly he refused large royalist bribes to hand Dunkirk over to Charles II, and loyally refused similar inducements from Mazarin, who purportedly promised him the title of marshal of France.<br>
<br>With the restoration of Charles II, Lockhart was superseded at Dunkirk by Edward Harley on 31 May 1660, but through the intercession of the earl of Middleton was not proceeded against for his activities. He retired to his Scottish estates, where he was unpopular with his neighbours on account of his Cromwellian connections, and eventually lived with his wife's relations in Huntingdonshire. John Maitland, duke of Lauderdale, secured him royal employment with appointment as a &#145;secret councillor&#146; for Scotland in September 1670, and a privy councillor in 1674. In June 1671 they secured the office of justice clerk for his aged father, whom he succeeded in 1674. Having raised 1000 men for the forthcoming campaign against Holland, in 1671 he was sent as ambassador to Brunswick and Brandenburg to secure their neutrality or co-operation, in the event unsuccessfully. According to Burnet, he was opposed to this assistance to Catholic France and served &#145;from a desire to be safe&#146;. In March 1673 he was reappointed envoy to France, taking leave of the king on 1 April, and performed satisfactorily enough to be raised to full ambassadorial rank when he reported to Charles in October. His permission to draw up his own equipage and submit the bill later indicated his known probity. His return was delayed by troubles in his regiment. Back in France he funded the now exiled Clarendon. By April 1675 the duke of Monmouth was commiserating on news of his &#145;indisposition&#146;, and he died early in June. A later story attributed his demise to a pair of poisoned gloves, but Burnet reported that he had been &#145;languishing&#146; and depressed at his mission for some time. His body was returned to Scotland on the yacht <i>Merlin</i> for burial, after long delays occasioned by bad weather. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>A &#145;gallant and sober person&#146;, according to Evelyn, adventurous in youth, and a courageous officer, Lockhart was also a skilful diplomat and a capable governor, loyal beyond expectations of personal advancement in 1660 and a lifelong promoter of international protestantism. An unapologetic careerist in developing his Cromwellian family connection, his fulsome flattery of Louis XIV and obsequious letters are also notable.<br>
