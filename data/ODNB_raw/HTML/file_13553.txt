<span class="headword">Holles,  Gilbert</span>, third earl of Clare  (1633&#150;1689), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 April 1633 and baptized at Hackney on 18 May following, the second but only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13555/', "John Holles, second earl of Clare (1595&#150;1666)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Vere (<i>d</i>. 1683), eldest daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28211/', "Horace Vere, Baron Vere of Tilbury")</script>. During his father's lifetime Gilbert Holles held the courtesy title of Lord Haughton. In August 1645 he was permitted by parliament to travel overseas and he appears to have avoided formal education in England. On 12 July 1655 he was contracted to, and shortly after married, Grace Pierrepont (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of William Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire (the second son of Robert Pierrepont, first earl of Kingston).<br>
<br>In the Convention Parliament of 1660 Haughton represented Nottinghamshire; he made no speeches and was not elected to a committee. Appointed deputy lieutenant in 1660, he remained on the Nottinghamshire commission for a decade but rarely acted. He succeeded to the earldom in January 1666 and first attended the Lords the following December. A private act of 1667 enabled Clare to sell parts of his estate to pay inherited debts and raise marriage portions for his sisters. Clare came to notice in the Lords in January 1674 with his criticism of the king's attending the house and attempting to influence debates; after his second attack he had to ask the pardon of the king and the house. He was a supporter of the 1674 <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> and, in the same session, of the proposal to exclude a Catholic from the succession if they married without parliamentary approval. As a result of these activities, Clare was seen by the court as one of the most &#145;forward&#146; lords and an associate of Shaftesbury  (Christie, 156&#150;7). In September 1674 Clare, who admitted to being &#145;much addicted to a natural melancholly&#146;, was given a licence to travel abroad for his health  (Newcastle deeds collection, Ne D 67). After his return to the Lords in February 1678 he fully justified Shaftesbury's rating of him as triple worthy, a rating he gave to only twelve peers. He remained a conscientious attender and consistent supporter of the country lords' policy. In December 1679 Clare joined the presenters of a petition to the king for the calling of a parliament. He supported the attempts in June 1680 of a Middlesex grand jury to indict James, duke of York, for recusancy. Clare was among the minority of thirty lords who voted for exclusion. The decision to call a parliament at Oxford saw Clare join in a protest of the leading whigs. At the parliament Clare dissented from the decision of the Lords that the legal proceedings against the informer Fitzharris should be by due course of law and not, as the whigs wanted, by impeachment. He continued a resolute supporter of Shaftesbury, standing surety at his trial in 1681, as he did for the duke of Monmouth the same year, and also spoke as a defence witness for Algernon Sidney in 1683. In the parliament of 1685 Clare joined the small group of whig lords in protests at decisions to reverse the impeachments of the popish lords of March 1679 and the attainder of Viscount Stafford, executed for his alleged participation in the Popish Plot. His last public act was to sign a petition of 17 November 1688 asking James to call a parliament. He died on 16 January 1689 at Warwick House, Holborn, and was buried at St James's Church, Haughton.<br>
<br>Though fined for conventicles held in his London properties, Clare was not an active patron of dissent. His will of 1686 shows him to have been an orthodox Calvinist and a critic of Arminianism. &#145;In this ill world&#146;, Clare complained, he found &#145;nothing but trouble and vexation of spiritt&#146;, and he particularly criticized his wife's frequent absences and love of London life. Despite his complaints about his indebted inheritance, which led to the sale of some London properties, he was able to retain the bulk of the estates he inherited. At his death they descended to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13556/', "John Holles, who later became duke of Newcastle upon Tyne")</script>.<br>
