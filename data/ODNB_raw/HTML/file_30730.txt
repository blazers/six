</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Berry, Sir  Graham</span>  (1822&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born at Twickenham, England, on 28 August 1822 to Benjamin Berry, a retired shopkeeper, and his wife, Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graham. After basic schooling, he was apprenticed to a draper; in 1846 he married the Scottish Harriet Ann Bencowe (1804&#150;1868), and by 1849 had his own shop in Chelsea. He emigrated to Melbourne in 1852, establishing a general store and wine and spirit business in South Yarra.<br>
<br>In the turmoil following the gold rushes, however, radical politics claimed Berry. In 1854 he sat on one of the juries which acquitted rebel miners who had defied the government at the Eureka Stockade, Ballarat. Soon he became a capable speaker and political organizer, and, in the post-gold rush depression, a passionate advocate of protectionism to foster native industry and, perhaps especially as father of a large and growing family (there were eleven children, eight of whom survived, from his first marriage), to employ native youth. In 1860 he bought the <span class="italic">Collingwood Observer</span>. At his third attempt, he entered the legislative assembly in 1861, for East Melbourne, and then for Collingwood at the August general elections. He opposed the Radical Party's alliance with businessmen and pastoralists in the McCulloch ministry in 1863, and after the 1864 elections formed a small, disciplined, protectionist opposition. McCulloch's battle with the legislative council over tariff increases, however, forced Berry to support the government, and when he opposed McCulloch on a point of political strategy, Collingwood rejected him as a traitor at the January 1866 elections.<br>
<br>Berry moved to Geelong and became part owner of the <span class="italic">Geelong Register</span>, amalgamating it later with the <span class="italic">Geelong Advertiser</span>. He supported McCulloch's party when the battle against the council revived in 1867, but not until it ended did he succeed in re-entering the assembly, at the Geelong West by-election of October 1868. This success was clouded by his wife's death shortly beforehand, but next year he married Rebecca Madge, daughter of J. B. Evans of Geelong. After much hesitation, he joined the dissidents who helped defeat McCulloch in September 1869, and in January 1870 became treasurer in the Macpherson ministry. The government was defeated on his budget in April, but when McCulloch's next ministry fell in June 1871, Berry again became treasurer, and commissioner for trade and customs, under the famous Irish radical, C. G. Duffy, and passed a strongly protectionist tariff. In May 1872 this ministry fell; worse, allegations of scandal and nepotism had forced Berry to resign office shortly beforehand.<br>
<br>Opportunity suddenly reopened three years later, when the Kerferd ministry resigned, its following divided over fiscal policy. In August 1875 Berry became premier, chief secretary, and treasurer, proposing to meet the deficit solely with a land tax. Although defeated in October, when McCulloch, having helped overthrow Kerferd, rejoined him and became premier, Berry unleashed a campaign of parliamentary obstruction and popular agitation which united radical Victoria behind him and a land tax to &#145;burst up the great estates&#146;. At the May 1877 elections, helped by an extensive new party organization and by Catholics who remembered Duffy, he won a resounding victory, and became once more premier, chief secretary, and treasurer.<br>
<br>The legislative council, dominated by landowners, had to accept Berry's land tax, but opposed a bill to make payment of members (a temporary measure first introduced in 1870) permanent. Berry &#145;tacked&#146; it to the appropriations bill, which the council rejected in December; as public funds ran out, he dramatized the crisis on &#145;black Wednesday&#146;, 8 January 1878, by dismissing higher public servants wholesale, and some judges and magistrates; rumours circulated of even more revolutionary intentions. In April, however, compromise secured payment of members; Berry now concentrated on reducing the council's power to obstruct the assembly.<br>
<br>When the council rejected his first attempt, Berry went on &#145;embassy&#146; to London in December 1878, with Professor C. H. Pearson as adviser, seeking imperial legislation to allow the assembly alone to reform the constitution. The Colonial Office, despite having recalled governor Sir George Bowen for supporting Berry during the crisis, did not exclude future intervention, but preferred a local settlement. Berry returned to a public triumph, claiming victory, but his party was divided about the embassy, his reform proposals, and other matters; the assembly denied his reform bill the necessary absolute majority by one vote. He then lost the elections of February 1880, in part because a recession, called the &#145;Berry blight&#146;, was commonly blamed on his actions. However, he defeated the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of his successor, James Service, narrowly won another election in July, and resumed his former offices; eventually he passed a bill which, abandoning mechanisms for resolving disputes between the houses, merely made the council's electoral basis somewhat less undemocratic. Further radical defections brought down his government in July 1881.<br>
<br>At the 1883 elections Berry and Service won roughly equal minorities; as no outstanding issues now separated them, Service became premier and Berry chief secretary. This alliance produced much practical legislation, promoted agricultural development inland, and freed the railways and public service from political patronage. In February 1886 Berry resigned and, after attending the first meeting of the newly established but rather ineffective federal council, became Victoria's agent-general in London, and was immediately appointed KCMG. There he took a vigorous part in lobbying the imperial government to curtail French imperialism in the New Hebrides, especially at the colonial conference of 1887. Further honours followed: he was made chevalier of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur and awarded the order of the Crown of Italy.<br>
<br>In 1891 Berry returned to a Melbourne battered by economic depression, and to the unfamiliar politics of the Labor Party and the federation movement. He won East Bourke Boroughs in the April 1892 election and became treasurer in Shiels's ministry, turning in vain to the old protectionist panacea; the ministry fell in January 1893. In 1894 he became speaker until losing his seat in 1897. As his financial affairs, after unaccustomed affluence in the 1880s, had now suffered disaster, the assembly bought him an annuity of &pound;500. Although elected to the federal convention in 1897, Berry was incapable of active participation; on 25 January 1904 he died of pneumonia at Balaclava, Melbourne, and was buried in Boroondara cemetery, Melbourne, after a public funeral. Lady Berry survived him, with her seven children and eight from his first marriage.<br>
<br>Berry provided a remarkable example of what a man of humble origins could achieve in colonial politics. A man of great emotional energy and a remarkable orator, he was unusual among colonial politicians for his appreciation of political organization; as a political strategist he had, in his heyday, no equal. His ambition and persistence through political setbacks and financial difficulties were harnessed to enlarging opportunities for ordinary people, and bringing wealth and power under democratic control. Conservative caricaturists mocked his tall, skinny frame and whiskers, and his problems with the letter H; in later years he polished his speech and style, filled out into a dignified figure, and acquired a public standing beyond mockery.<br>
