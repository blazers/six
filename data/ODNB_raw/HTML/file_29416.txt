<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkins, Sir  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1749, <em>d.</em> 1836), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, born at Frome, Somerset, where he was baptized on 21 June 1749, was the son of Hugh Wilkins and Mary Wray. His mother was niece of the engraver Robert Bateman Wray and of Charles Wray, a partner in Hoare's Bank in London, who procured a writership in the East India Company's Bengal establishment for his great-nephew. In 1770 Wilkins proceeded to Bengal and became superintendent of the company's factories at Malda. Following the example of his friend Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, and with the encouragement of Warren Hastings, the governor-general, he took up the study of Sanskrit and became the first Englishman to master the language. Wilkins was one of the pioneer orientalists of British India who, under the leadership of Sir William Jones, made Calcutta the centre of a new type of orientalism, focusing on India and the Sanskrit language, which had a considerable vogue in Europe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; the study of Sanskrit and Indian antiquities, according to an idea widely prevalent in Europe, would bring about an &#145;Oriental Renaissance&#146; similar to the Renaissance that had been brought about by the revival of Greek letters.<br>
<br>Wilkins's contributions to the new orientalism began with the leading role he played in establishing, in 1778, a printing press for oriental languages, for which he was (in the words of Halhed) &#145;metallurgist, engraver, founder, and printer&#146; of types for Bengali and Persian. His Bengali types were used in Halhed's <span class="italic">Grammar of the Bengali Language</span> (1778), the first English primer for that language, at a time when knowledge of Bengali among company servants was rare; his press had a profound effect upon the people of Bengal, ushering Bengali literature into the era of printing. The same year, he tells us, his curiosity excited by the example of Halhed (who had begun the study of Sanskrit, and who had published a few brief characterizations of that language, including comparisons with Greek), he took up the study of Sanskrit. Halhed did not get very far in his study of the language, and continued to rely on Persian translations for his knowledge of the content of Sanskrit literature. Wilkins, however, succeeded, and after the arrival in Calcutta of Sir William Jones, who was already famous for the brilliance of his accomplishments in Persian and Arabic, became fast friends with Jones and assisted him in learning Sanskrit. In 1784 Wilkins was one of a small band of company servants who founded the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, with Jones as president. His publications in the first volume (1788) of the society's journal, <span class="italic">Asiatic Researches</span>, comprised three articles translating ancient inscriptions of India, which launched the modern study of Indian epigraphy, and a brief description of the Sikh religion; the second volume (1790), published after his departure from India, contained translations of two more inscriptions.<br>
<br>Besides his contributions to Indian typography and epigraphy, Wilkins undertook three projects which, though not fully realized, were to provide the foundations for the new orientalism: a Sanskrit grammar, a Sanskrit dictionary, and a translation of the great epic, the <span class="italic">Mahabharata</span>. Each of these projects was a massive undertaking in its own way: the grammar because it would have to include an extensive vocabulary, because there was no published Sanskrit&#150;English dictionary, and because a Devanagari typeface would have to be devised, the dictionary because of the vastness of the Sanskrit language and its literature, and the <span class="italic">Mahabharata</span> because it is the longest epic poem in the world, conventionally reckoned to consist of 100,000 verses. Ultimately he published the grammar but not the dictionary (of which there are some manuscript remains), and translated as much as a third of the <span class="italic">Mahabharata</span>, publishing, however, only parts of it.<br>
<br>The first of these projects to appear was his translation of a part of the <span class="italic">Mahabharata</span>, the <span class="italic">Bhagavad gita</span>, an important text of Hindu devotionalism, which was published in London (as <span class="italic">The Bhagvat-Geeta</span>) by the East India Company in 1785. He had sent it to Warren Hastings who, apparently without consulting him, forwarded it to the court of directors with a recommendation to publish, and who supplied a preface for it. It enjoyed a great response in Europe and in America (especially among the transcendentalist writers of New England), and was much translated, French and Russian versions appearing more or less immediately, in 1787.<br>
<br>Wilkins left India and the company service in 1786, for reasons that are not wholly clear but which seem to include the departure of his friend and patron Hastings, the state of his own health, and private affairs; in 1787, soon after returning to England, he married Elizabeth Keble, in London. They resided at Bath for a time, and then returned to London, where they were living in 1788 when Wilkins was elected to the Royal Society in recognition of his pioneering Sanskrit studies and his typographical achievements. His first wife died about that time, and late in 1789 he married Lucy Shingler at Hawkhurst in Kent. During this period he published a translation of the <span class="italic">Hitopadesha</span> (1787), a book of political wisdom presented through animal fables and popular tales which has ever since played a large role in the learning of Sanskrit in the West, and another part of his <span class="italic">Mahabharata</span> translation, the story of Shakuntala (1794, 1795). (At about the same time Sir William Jones published a translation of Kalidasa's dramatic version of this story which was well received in Europe and translated into many European languages.) In 1800 Wilkins re-entered the service of the East India Company as librarian, an office then established mainly for the care of its collection of manuscripts, many of them taken in the victory over Tipu Sultan at Seringapatam. On the establishment in 1806 of East India College at Hertford Castle (later Haileybury College) he accepted the offices of examiner and visitor, and continued the duties up to his death in London on 13 May 1836; he was interred in the graveyard of St John's Wood Chapel. He left three daughters; the eldest, Elizabeth, was married to the philologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18102/', "William Marsden (1754&#150;1836)")</script>, with whom Wilkins shared many scholarly interests.<br>
<br>Wilkins's literary achievements were recognized by his election to the Royal Society and by the award in 1825 of the society's gold medal, inscribed &#145;Carolo Wilkins literaturae Sanskritae principi&#146;; and by his creation of DCL of Oxford in 1805; he was also an associate of the Institut de France. He was knighted in 1833.<br>
<br>European knowledge of ancient Indian literature and the Sanskrit language owes a great deal to the pioneering efforts of Charles Wilkins. He was greatly esteemed by Sir William Jones, who stated that he took up Sanskrit himself only because Wilkins's determination to return to Europe left him without a guide in Sanskrit literature; and after Wilkins's departure he more than once described him, only slightly inaccurately, as the only person in Europe who knew Sanskrit. In addition to highly regarded translations of Sanskrit works, Wilkins soon set about establishing Sanskrit learning in England. In 1795 he designed and cast a fount of type in the Devanagari script for the Sanskrit grammar he was writing, but it was destroyed when his house burnt down; it would have been the first of its kind. He abandoned the project, but resumed it after the formation of East India College, having been encouraged by Alexander Hamilton, Sanskrit professor of the college, publishing the grammar in 1808 for the use of its students. Two others had been published in Bengal nearly simultaneously, by William Carey (1804) and Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1805). Hitherto Sanskrit could only be learned in India, from pandits, and Calcutta had had a virtual monopoly of the new orientalism; now it could be learned from books, in Europe, at a time when Sanskrit instruction had been inaugurated by Hamilton's appointment to the first European professorship in Sanskrit.<br>
<br>Although Wilkins never completed his dictionary of Sanskrit, he produced three lexicographical publications, the first of which seems to be a fragment of that project: it was a treatise on the roots of Sanskrit (1815). The second was a glossary of words in Indian languages having to do with land revenue, which was attached to the so-called fifth report on the East India Company (1812), a work that was later elaborated upon and superseded by H. H. Wilson's extensive dictionary of Indian revenue terminology. The third was his revision of John Richardson's <span class="italic">A Dictionary: Persian, Arabic, and English</span> (1806); Persian was the lingua franca of Indian diplomacy, and the medium through which the new orientalism made its first approaches to knowledge of Sanskrit literature.<br>
