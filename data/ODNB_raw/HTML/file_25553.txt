<span class="headword">Simcoe,  Henry Addington</span>  (1800&#150;1868), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 28 February 1800 in Plymouth, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25554/', "Lieutenant-General John Graves Simcoe (1752&#150;1806)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47795/', "Elizabeth Postuma Simcoe (1762&#150;1850)")</script>, the diarist and artist, only daughter of Thomas Gwillim of Old Court, Herefordshire. He was educated at Eton College and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 13 April 1818, obtaining his BA on 17 December 1821, and his MA on 3 November 1825. He married, on 8 February 1822, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1840), second daughter of the Revd Edward Palmer, vicar of Moseley in Worcestershire and Stogumber in Somerset; they had five sons and four daughters. Following his ordination Simcoe was in 1826 appointed curate at Egloskerry with Tremaine in Cornwall.<br>
<br>After the death of his father in 1806 Simcoe had inherited the estate of Wolford at Dunkeswell in Devon; in 1826 he inherited the estate of William Walcot of Oundle, Northamptonshire, the Simcoes' native county, and through his mother's family he acquired property in Herefordshire. In 1830 he purchased the picturesque Jacobean manor house of Penheale in Egloskerry, with its gardens, fishponds, and avenue of lime trees. Simcoe maintained a private printing press at Penheale, producing over twenty theological works and nine volumes of a periodical, <span class="italic">Light from the West, or, The Cornish Parochial Visitor</span>. His interests also included agriculture, chemistry, and medicine; he acted as unofficial medical adviser to his parishioners, providing them with free drugs developed in his own laboratory. Anne Simcoe died on 6 December 1840, and two years later, on 21 December 1842, Simcoe married Emily (<i>d</i>. 24 May 1877), second daughter of the Revd Horace Mann, rector of Mawgan with St Martin, Cornwall; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Simcoe was instituted perpetual curate of Egloskerry and Tremaine on 4 July 1846 (he had recently acquired the advowson) and he also served as rural dean of Trigg Major. During his long incumbency he held four services with sermons every Sunday in each of his two churches, a feat remarked upon in the sermon delivered at his funeral. Simcoe died at Penheale House on 15 November 1868, and was buried in Egloskerry churchyard on 24 November; his obituary in <span class="italic">One and All</span> described him as &#145;a much-esteemed clergyman of the Evangelical school&#146;, while an illuminated address, presented to his widow by the parishioners, praised his great physical strength, punctuality, benevolence, and &#145;uncompromising support of Protestant and Evangelical truth&#146;: he was known locally as the Apostle of the West.<br>
