<span class="headword">Holden,  Hubert Ashton</span>  (1822&#150;1896), <span class="occ">classical scholar and headmaster</span>, was born in Birmingham on 12 May 1822, the son of Hyla Holden (1792&#150;1849), incumbent of Erdington, Warwickshire, and his wife, Anne. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, first under Francis Jeune, and then under James Prince Lee. He proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, and in his first year of residence in 1842 gained the first Bell university scholarship. He graduated BA in 1845, being senior classic and junior optime in the mathematical tripos. He was fellow of Trinity College from 1847 to 1854, when he vacated his fellowship by his marriage on 18 July to Laetitia, elder daughter of R. E. Lofft of Troston Hall, Suffolk; they had three sons (the eldest of whom was the army officer and inventor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101352/', "Sir Henry Capel Lofft Holden")</script>) and five daughters.<br>
<br>Holden was ordained deacon in 1848 and took priest's orders in 1858. He was assistant tutor and classical lecturer of his college from 1848 until 1853, when he was appointed vice-principal of Cheltenham College, continuing in that post until 1858. From 1858 to 1883 he was headmaster of Queen Elizabeth's School, Ipswich, where he was chosen to succeed Stephen Jordan Rigaud. In a successful effort to raise academic standards and improve discipline he replaced the entire full-time teaching staff. He taught only the sixth form himself, but knew and followed the progress of every pupil. In 1866 all ten boys leaving the sixth form entered Cambridge, eight with scholarships. He was invited to the first conference of headmasters, convened by Edward Thring at Uppingham in 1869, and attended in the following year and every meeting thereafter. Always immaculately dressed, he took his afternoon ride on a well-groomed horse, and never appeared on foot in Ipswich without cap and gown. He inherited the antagonism towards the school among radicals on the town council that dated from his predecessor's period of office. He held no speech day after 1876, probably because he objected to sharing a platform with the governors, who disliked what they perceived as his reserved and superior manner. Their chance to be rid of him arrived in 1883 when he rashly wrote offering his resignation when building works overran into the September term and he was not permitted to defer the school's opening. His attempt to retract was rejected, and he left unthanked and unregretted by his governors, but revered by his pupils and by his colleagues, all but one of whom left just before or with him. He published a fifty page <span class="italic">Plain Statement of the Circumstances Attending my Resignation</span>.<br>
<br>In 1890 Holden was appointed by the crown to a fellowship of the University of London, where he was classical examiner from 1869 until 1874, and examiner in Greek from 1886 until 1890. In 1892 the degree of LittD was conferred on him by Dublin University. He was a vice-president of the Hellenic Society from 1893. He died on 1 December 1896 at 20 Redcliffe Square, London, and was buried on 5 December at Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Holden, who was a classical scholar of fine taste and full knowledge, was best known for his collections of English passages for translation into Latin and Greek, <span class="italic">Foliorum silvula</span> and <span class="italic">Foliorum centuriae</span> (1852), and for a selection of Latin and Greek versions of these published as <span class="italic">Folia silvulae</span> (1865 and 1870). He also produced useful editions of various classical texts, including several of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span> and Xenophon's <span class="italic">Hiero</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">Cyropaedeia</span> (1887&#150;90).<br>
<br>A cousin, <a name="cosubject_54038"></a><span class="headword">Henry Holden</span>  (1814&#150;1909), <span class="occ">classical scholar and headmaster</span>, was born at Birmingham on 7 July 1814, the second son of Henry Augustus Holden (1785&#150;1870), a clergyman, and his wife, Mary Willetts Holden. He was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33929/', "Luther Holden")</script>, surgeon and anatomist. Educated at Shrewsbury School under Samuel Butler, he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1832, the holder of one of the earliest scholarships at that college to be awarded by open competition. Gaining first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>, he graduated BA in 1837 and MA in 1839, and was ordained in the latter year. He was incumbent of Upminster from 1839 to 1845. As headmaster of Uppingham School from 1845 to 1853 (and predecessor to Edward Thring), with Richard Dacre Archer Hind he edited <span class="italic">Sabrinae corolla in hortulis regiae scholae Salopiensis continuerunt tres viri floribus legendis</span> (1850), a collection of poetical extracts with translations into Latin or Greek, which was highly influential on the practice of versification in schools and universities. Holden was headmaster of Durham Cathedral school from 1853 until 1882, then vicar of South Luffenham, Rutland, from 1881 until 1898. He was married: first, on 19 January 1847, to Elizabeth Margaret Anne (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of the Revd Richard Edmonds, and second, on 19 December 1857, to Georgiana, daughter of Byron Aldham, a merchant. He retired to Boscobel, Streatham Common, London, where he died on 30 March 1909.<br>
