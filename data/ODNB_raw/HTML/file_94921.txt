<span class="headword">Warner, Sir  Jean-Pierre Frank Eugene</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">barrister and judge</span>, was born at 39 Holland Park, Kensington, London, on 24 September 1924, the elder of two sons of Frank Cloudesley ffolliot Warner, silk and textile manufacturer, and his wife, Louise Marie Blanche, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gouet, a Frenchwoman. On his father's death in 1928 Warner's mother returned to France, taking her two sons with her; Warner received his early education in France. In 1938 he was sent to Harrow School but, after the outbreak of the Second World War and to avoid cross-channel travelling, he returned to school in France, where he remained until the fall of France in 1940 when, with his mother and brother, he escaped to England and resumed his education at Harrow.<br>
<br>From Harrow, Warner went to Trinity College, Cambridge. After four terms he left to join the rifle brigade, into which he was commissioned. Demobilized in 1947 with the rank of acting major and after service with Lord Mountbatten's staff in the Far East, he returned to Trinity and took a first in law in 1948. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1950 and on 2 September the same year, at Lincoln's Inn chapel, he married Sylvia Frances Goodale, the 23-year-old daughter of Ernest William Goodale, like Warner's father a textile manufacturer; they had two daughters. Warner had joined the highly respected chancery chambers of J. H. Stamp, and quickly established a successful practice in the fields of trust and fiscal law. In 1961 he was appointed junior counsel to the registrar of restrictive trading agreements, the official entrusted with the administration and enforcement of the <span class="roman">Restrictive Trade Practices Act</span> of 1956, a major legislative innovation in what was, for the United Kingdom, a relatively new and undeveloped field of competition law. In 1964 Warner progressed to the post of junior counsel to the Treasury (&#145;Treasury devil&#146;) on the chancery side, which involved responsibility for advising the government on a wide range of chancery and fiscal legal issues. He was appointed queen's counsel in November 1972. Despite the pressure of work at the bar, Warner found time to sit as a Conservative councillor in the borough of Kensington from 1959 to 1968 (between 1963 and 1965 he chaired its general purposes committee). He was also a non-executive director of the family firm of silk fabric manufacturers between 1952 and 1970, being elected as a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Weavers in 1952. He was a noted oenophile (chevalier du tastevin, 1952; commandeur, 1960; member, Confrerie St Etienne d'Alsace, 1981).<br>
<br>In 1972, when the United Kingdom signed the treaty of accession to the European Communities, Warner was nominated as the first British advocate-general of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (the ECJ), a post he held from 1973 until 1981. He was exceptionally well qualified for this post since he was bilingual in English and French, the latter being the ECJ's &#145;working language&#146; (as advocate-general he would read through the French translations of his opinions and correct them where necessary). He also had, unusually for a British lawyer at that time, a specialist knowledge of competition law, which then formed part of the staple diet of the ECJ. Finally, his position as Treasury junior had enabled him to observe the work of government particularly closely, again a real advantage as a member of the ECJ.<br>
<br>As advocate-general, Warner's responsibility was to deliver in open court an independent opinion on the merits of the cases assigned to him. An advocate-general's opinions provided important assistance to the judges hearing the case. By the 1970s, when Warner joined the ECJ, its case law had already begun to accumulate and Warner's experience at the English bar stood him in good stead in analysing it and, where necessary, drawing inspiration from the principles enunciated in the national courts of the member states in an eclectic and synthetic process which, especially in that period, characterized the development of EC law. Warner's contribution was not confined to proceeding down already opened avenues, however. In one case he persuaded the ECJ to take what was then the revolutionary step of declining to answer a reference made by a national court for a preliminary ruling on the ground that there was no genuine dispute before the referring court. In another it was Warner's influence that led the ECJ to give careful consideration to the principles underlying the different rules in the member states regarding the confidentiality of lawyer&#150;client communications, which led to the ultimate establishment in EC law of principles similar to the English concept of legal professional privilege.<br>
<br>Warner returned to London in March 1981, having been appointed a judge of the chancery division of the High Court of Justice. A condition of his appointment at the ECJ was that he satisfied national requirements for appointment to the highest judicial office (in the United Kingdom, the House of Lords) and, as he had served with distinction as a member of the supreme court of the European Communities, many colleagues regretted that he was appointed only as a judge of first instance. After eight years' absence from London, appointment to a first instance post was not, in any event, Warner's m&eacute;tier and, dogged as he was by worsening health, it is doubtful whether, conscientiously though he performed his judicial duties, he enjoyed them as greatly as he had his time at the ECJ.<br>
<br>With Warner's appointment to the High Court bench in 1981 came a knighthood and, in 1982, appointment as a judge of the UK restrictive practices court. In 1985 he was elected treasurer of Lincoln's Inn, of which he had been a bencher since the relatively early age of forty-two. In 1994 he retired from the High Court. In 1998 he was awarded the grand cross, order of Merit, of Luxembourg, the country where the ECJ had its seat. The United Kingdom failed to give him similar public recognition. However, three British universities, Exeter, Leicester, and Edinburgh, conferred on him honorary doctorates, which reflected also his work as vice-president and then president of the UK Association for European Law between 1975 and 1989.<br>
<br>Warner (known to his friends as J.-P.) lived latterly in Kensington, London. He died at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, on 1 February 2005. The building of the ECJ in Luxembourg was constructed with a lining of asbestos material, and this may have been the origin of the &#145;industrial disease of mesothelioma&#146; recorded, following an inquest, as the cause of his death. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. A memorial service was held at Lincoln's Inn chapel on 18 May 2005.<br>
