<span class="headword">Blund,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1175&#150;1248), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic</span>, is first recorded as one of a group of scholars lecturing on the liberal arts in the schools of Oxford at the end of the twelfth century. The only source for his early career is a Latin verse panegyric written by Henry d'Avranches in 1232 in support of Blund's election to the see of Canterbury. From this it is known that he studied arts, probably at Paris, and returned to Oxford to lecture on the arts in the last years of the twelfth century. Possibly this phase of his career was terminated by the suspension of the Oxford schools in 1209 after the summary hanging of two clerks by the city authorities. He returned to Paris to study theology and after twelve years he incepted and taught as a doctor of theology. He again suffered displacement by the &#145;great dispersal&#146; of the University of Paris in 1229, a protest at the violent repression by the provost of Paris of student disorder. Matthew Paris names Blund as one of five famous English masters who returned home at this time, perhaps in response to an open invitation made by Henry III to the aggrieved scholars of Paris. Four of them, including Blund, were promptly rewarded with royal notice and patronage&#151;though with John Blund it is necessary, but not always easy, to distinguish him from a contemporary of the same name, a royal clerk and canon of Lichfield, who died in 1239.<br>
<br>Master John Blund had acquired a prebend in Chichester Cathedral at some time before 1232, and besides this he obtained the parish livings of Horsley in Derbyshire and Barton in Cambridgeshire, which he held in plurality. He stood high in the favour of the king and the king's mentor, Peter des Roches, the bishop of Winchester. Consequently, on 27 August 1232 he was elected archbishop, by the monks of Canterbury, to succeed Richard Grant, who had died in Italy in the preceding year. The royal assent was promptly signified on 30 August, and on 10 September Blund embarked for Rome with a party from the Canterbury chapter. At the curia, however, Pope Gregory IX, acting on the advice of Simon Langton, the archdeacon of Canterbury, quashed the election. It was alleged that Blund's case failed because he was found to be a pluralist, holding two benefices involving cure of souls, without the requisite dispensations. This is implausible as he was immediately granted the necessary dispensations and received an indult allowing him to be elected to any other bishopric. He was more likely to have been compromised by the support of Peter des Roches, whose political activities were regarded with suspicion at the curia. Returning home, he continued to be favoured with gifts from the king. In 1234 he was appointed chancellor of York Cathedral by Archbishop Walter de Gray, a position he held until his death in 1248.<br>
<br>Blund wrote a treatise on the soul, the only work of his known to survive. A typical scholastic dissertation, disputatious in form, it is probably a product of his Oxford lectures in arts. The fact that Alexander Neckham borrowed from it indicates that it was composed in the years 1197&#150;1204. Although the author's analysis of cognition and the powers of the soul shows familiarity with the <span class="italic">Physics</span> and the other <span class="italic">libri naturales</span> of Aristotle, his major source of inspiration is the <span class="italic">De anima</span> of the Muslim philosopher Avicenna 
    (Ibn Sina; <i>d</i>. 1037)
  . His work thus demonstrates the absorption by the schools of Paris and Oxford at the beginning of the thirteenth century of Arabic science as well as of the newly translated scientific books of Aristotle.<br>
