<span class="headword">Lewis,  William Lillington</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1743, <em>d.</em> 1772), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was baptized on 16 August 1743 at the church of St Michael, Gloucester, the son of William Lillington Lewis and his wife, Elizabeth. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 18 November 1760, graduated BA in 1764, and became a fellow and received an MA in 1767.<br>
<br>In his short life Lewis produced a single work: the first complete translation into English of P. Papinius Statius's late first-century epic the <span class="italic">Thebaid</span> (2 vols., 1767):<blockquote>I had long considered it as the most illustrious Work of <i>Roman</i> Antiquity after the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, and consequently was concerned, that it had never appeared in an <i>English</i> Dress. &hellip; With more Ambition therefore than Prudence, I begun it soon after I entered at the University, at the Age of eighteen, and must confess, that my chief Merit consists in having had the Patience to go through with it at a Time of Life, which is too often squandered away in a Circle of Follies and Amusements. (Lewis, preface, 1.xxi)</blockquote>Various parts of the <span class="italic">Thebaid</span> had been translated before, and Lewis draws especially on Alexander Pope's version of the first book (1712) and Walter Harte's of the sixth (1727). In style of translation he is a follower of Pope, but, unlike him, Lewis is a zealous partisan of Statius, defending the Roman poet's art even when it may offend English Augustan taste. Statius's representation of cruel and monstrous behaviour on the battlefield exceeds the &#145;tolerable&#146; in Pope's view, as when &#145;<i>Tydeus</i> in the very Pangs of Death is represented as knawing the Head of his Enemy&#146; at the end of <span class="italic">Thebaid</span>, book 8  (Pope, note on <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, book 22, line 437); but Lewis marshals an array of arguments to defend his author.<br>
<br>Lewis's work, which is among the best eighteenth-century translations, ably captures the sublimity, eeriness, and violence of the original. Statius's style is highly allusive, with constant reference to his epic predecessors, especially Homer, Virgil (his acknowledged master), and Lucan. To represent this allusive quality in English, Lewis draws on Pope's <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, Dryden's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, and Rowe's <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span>, among other works. His practice is to signal an allusion in Statius by adapting the language and expressions that his English predecessors used for the very passage to which Statius alludes. For instance, in book 3 Venus tries to prevent Mars, her erstwhile lover, from inciting the Argives to begin hostilities against Thebes. Lewis notes that &#145;This Speech of <i>Venus</i> is written in the Spirit of <i>Dido's</i> to <i>Aeneas</i>; and in many Places not only the Sentiment, but even the Diction is similar&#146;  (Lewis, 1.102); he translates:<blockquote>
<div>Go then; thy Flight no longer I detain;<br>
</div>
<div>Go; bathe in kindred Blood the Theban Plain.<br>
</div> (ibid., book 3, lines 393&#150;4)</blockquote>Dido speaks thus in Dryden's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>:<blockquote>
<div>But go; thy flight no longer I detain;<br>
</div>
<div>Go seek thy promis'd Kingdom through the Main.<br>
</div> (Dryden, <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, book 4, lines 548&#150;9)</blockquote>Although Lewis makes the allusion to the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> more explicit than does Statius, his use of Dryden admirably reproduces the allusive texture of Roman epic. Lewis died in 1772.<br>
