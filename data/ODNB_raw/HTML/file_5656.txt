<span class="headword">Clifford,  Martin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1677), <span class="occ">headmaster and author</span>, eldest son of Henry Clifford, gentleman, and his wife, Cecily (<i>bap</i>. 1600), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9974/', "Bishop Martin Fotherby")</script> of Salisbury and his wife, Margaret Winter, was presumably born in London. His parents were married in All Hallows Church in Lombard Street, London, on 17 December 1623 and his younger brother, Francis, died as a baby in 1625. By the time his sister, Mabel, died in 1639 at the age of ten, his father was already dead.<br>
<br>Clifford attended Westminster School as a king's scholar and liberty boy. In 1640 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a contemporary of the duke of Buckingham and of Abraham Cowley, with whom he would conduct a lifelong friendly and learned correspondence. Like most eldest sons of the gentry, he did not graduate, but he had acquired &#145;good learning, and might have been eminent had not the wars hindred his progress&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.999). What became of him during the civil war is not known. According to Warren's contemporary life, he was &#145;always loyal to his King&#146;  (Warren, 144) and it seems that he followed the court into exile. A letter from Abraham Cowley to the duke of Ormond on 26 December 1659 suggests that at that time Clifford was in Brussels.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Clifford became Buckingham's secretary and lived at the Savoy. As an unrepentant drinker and talented and biting poet, Clifford was much sought after among the court wits. In May 1669 he mocked in verses Edward Howard's prolix and bombastic heroic poem &#145;The Brittish princes&#146;, while in four defamatory letters, probably written between January 1671 and July 1672  (Winn, 579), he charged John Dryden with plagiarism. The latter circulated by transcripts until their posthumous publication as <span class="italic">Notes upon Mr. Dryden's Poems in Four Letters</span> (1687). It was said that he had a hand, along with Cowley, Thomas Sprat, and Edmund Waller, in producing the famous &#145;Rehearsal&#146; by Buckingham, and according to Evelyn he was involved with Buckingham, Sprat, Waller, and Evelyn himself in promoting a society aimed primarily at the improvement and the polishing of the English tongue  (J. Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>, ed. W. Bray, 1906, 3.455&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1671 Clifford was elected master of the Charterhouse, probably through the influence of Buckingham. His meagre salary was raised by the mediation of the earl of Shaftesbury. During the years of his mastership he loved conversing on poetry, religion, and human nature with Dame Sarah Cowper (1640&#150;1719), who wrote that &#145;Because he treated Fools according to their Folly, it gott him the Charecter of ill Nature; but I never knew him other than Compassionate, Charitable, generous and Just&#146;. In spite of her assertion that he was, &#145;no Contemner of Religion, or such as maintain the principles of it, but wou'd express great Veneration for B<sup>p</sup> Wilkins D<sup>r</sup> Tillot: D<sup>r</sup> Barrow and the like&#146;  (Herts. ALS, D/EP F30, fol. 131), and although his office demanded adherence to the established church, Clifford seems to have been a covert deist.<br>
<br>In 1674 Clifford published anonymously in London <span class="italic">A Treatise of Humane Reason</span>, which stirred up a ten-year controversy by advancing the hypothesis of salvation even for an honest erring conscience. It was frequently reprinted. Not long after its publication Bishop Benjamin Laney of Ely dined with many &#145;persons of quality&#146; in the Charterhouse, when he was asked about his opinion on that book. Undoubtedly unaware that he was in the presence of its author, the bishop answered that &#145;twas no matter if all the copies were burnt and the author with them, knowing by what he had read in the book that the author makes every man's private fancy judge of religion&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.999).<br>
<br>On 10 December 1677 Clifford died at Sutton's Hospital in the Charterhouse, &#145;not much lamented by the Pensioners&#146;  (Warren, 144), and was buried on the 13th in the chancel of St Margaret's, Westminster. His funeral was attended by many lords including the duke of Buckingham. In 1682 the Unitarian author William Popple (1638&#150;1708) published a French translation of Clifford's treatise introduced by a longer preface justifying the opinions in it, with the title <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de la raison humaine traduit de l'anglois</span> (1682). This aroused great interest among the Huguenot refugees in Holland.<br>
