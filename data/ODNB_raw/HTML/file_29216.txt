<span class="headword">Whiston,  John</span>  (1711&#150;1780), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in London on 30 July 1711, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29217/', "William Whiston (1667&#150;1752)")</script>, theologian, and his wife, Ruth Antrobus (1671&#150;1751). Whiston's early years remain vague, though it is known that he was apprenticed to Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller in Holborn, before being made free of the Merchant Taylors' Company on 6 February 1733; he entered the livery of that company on 19 December 1746. Within a year of completing his apprenticeship, Whiston had established a bookshop in Fleet Street, London, under the sign of Mr Boyle's Head in honour of Robert Boyle and in recognition of his father's position in 1707 as the Boyle lecturer at Oxford. The shop reputedly became the rendezvous for distinguished literati and clergymen.<br>
<br>Whiston's earliest distinctions were as one of the printers of the votes of the House of Commons and as one of the original publishers of priced catalogues. In 1735 he bought and catalogued the entire library of Edward Chishull and in 1747 he catalogued the library of Bishop Moore at Cambridge University which had been bequeathed by George I in 1715. Whiston was also called upon to assist with the disposal of Nicholas Mann's library at Eton College following Mann's death in 1753. Some twelve years later Whiston purchased, seemingly for his own collection, the books which had been in the possession of Adam Anderson (1692?&#150;1765).<br>
<br>Whiston seems to have published numerous books though nothing of any real distinction. His father's writings were a primary concern and it was in 1749 that he issued the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Mr William Whiston</span>; he issued a corrected version in the year after his father's death. During 1761&#150;2, he was actively involved in promoting the <span class="italic">New and General Biographical Dictionary</span>, which was printed in twelve volumes; a copy of it in the British Library contains extensive marginalia in his hand. He was also noted by John Nichols in <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> as the source of much biographical information. It is believed that at one point his elder brother, George Whiston, was associated with Whiston's business, although this cannot be substantiated. However, between 1749 and 1765 Whiston was, in fact, in partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57016/', "Benjamin White")</script>, a former apprentice. It was during this time that Whiston most likely married and his daughters, Sarah and Sophia, were born. On 3 July 1759 Nathaniel Conant was turned over to Whiston to complete his apprenticeship; he later married Whiston's daughter Sarah.<br>
<br>About 1767 Whiston's business moved to premises at 64 Fleet Street following the dissolution of his partnership with White, who opened his own bookshop next door. By most accounts, though, Whiston had not taken an active role in conducting his business since 1759 when he was apparently forced to retire by a nervous breakdown, reputedly, though implausibly, brought on by shock occasioned by a practical joke. It is said that he spent some time in an asylum and that the bookselling business was carried on by Conant in his absence. On 20 November 1766 Whiston drew up a lengthy, complicated, and at times anguished will over which the experience of his breakdown loomed very large. He began by imploring God to &#145;supply my want of faith and hope both [of] which by a fatal accident I have for more than seven years been deprived of&#146; and concluded with the request that he be buried at Lyndon, Rutland, near the graves of his parents, with a &#145;plain stone&#146; carrying an inscription that &#145;A most unhappy [matter?] in May 1759 caused him to pass the remainder of his days in great misery of Mind and Body&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1066, fols. 71<i>v</i>, 73<i>r</i>). The bookseller Lockyer Davis is cited as one of the executors. However, despite his morbid thoughts of late 1766, Whiston did not die until 3 May 1780 and his will, several lines of which he had crossed out in the meantime, was proved on 22 May.<br>
