<span class="headword">Violante,  Pauline</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Selina Young]</span>  (<em>b. </em>1840/41), <span class="occ">tightrope walker</span>, was the second of the two daughters of Elizabeth Wild, actress, and a bandsman named Young. Her parents acted with Old Wild's, a company of travelling players from Yorkshire, but had left to marry by 1830. Trained as an acrobat, Selina Young performed at Bury with Samuel Wild's company in 1853 as &#145;Pauline Violante, the first tight-rope dancer in the world&#146;. In 1858 she became the first artist to cross a high wire at the Crystal Palace.<br>
<br>G. Van Hare (<i>b</i>. 1815), manager of the Alhambra, renamed Young the Female Blondin in 1861. She amazed audiences by ascending a telegraph wire stretched from the stage to the roof. Edward Tyrrel Smith (1804&#150;1877) contracted her to walk a tightrope across the Thames from Battersea Bridge to the Cremorne Gardens. Dressed in Albanian national costume, she made her attempt on 12 August 1861, watched by 20,000 spectators. Although a poorly weighted wire forced her to abandon her crossing, she succeeded in a second effort the following Monday.<br>
<br>During her career Young crossed the high rope in several dangerous ways: in a suit of armour, in a sack, and pushing a wheelbarrow. She had imitators using the same pseudonym, notably Madame Genieve (Selina Powell, with whom she is sometimes confused), who, eight months pregnant, was killed falling from a rope at Aston Park in July 1863.<br>
<br>Young's career came to a violent conclusion on 14 August 1862 at Highbury Barn. As she crossed the wire amid a spectacular firework display, she stumbled and fell 50 feet to the gravel below, fracturing her left leg and shoulder. Attended by several doctors who happened to be dining nearby, she was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital the following morning, emerging from Queen's ward on 24 October. Newspapers reported that she had urged surgeons to amputate the useless leg, which was 3 inches shorter than the other.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1862 an appeal was launched on Young's behalf by Felix Joseph (1840&#150;1892) and Sarah Ann Hughes, Young's aunt, the widow of Edwin Hughes (1813&#150;1867), circus proprietor. Joseph stressed that Young's career had provided support for her aged father and invalid sister (her mother had died some years previously). A total of &pound;300 was collected, allowing them to set up as shopkeepers. In 1864 she married Charles Greaves jun., and kept an inn in Surrey. Selina Young died in obscurity, her passing unrecorded by the press.<br>
