<span class="headword">Shirley,  Walter Waddington</span>  (1828&#150;1866), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25439/', "Walter Augustus Shirley (1797&#150;1847)")</script>, bishop of Sodor and Man, and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1854), daughter of William Waddington of Impington Hall, Cambridgeshire, was born at Shirley, Derbyshire, on 24 July 1828. He was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold. His closest friend at school and throughout his life was his cousin, William Henry Waddington, later the French foreign minister. In June 1846 Shirley matriculated at University College, Oxford, but in the following year he migrated to Wadham College, where he had gained a scholarship. He obtained a first class in mathematics in 1851, and in 1852 was elected a fellow of his college. He was compelled to vacate his fellowship three years later, when his mother's death brought him into possession of a small landed property. He married on 4 July 1855 Philippa, daughter of Samuel Knight, of Impington, Cambridgeshire. They had three daughters and three sons, one of whom died young. The eldest surviving son, Walter Knight Shirley, succeeded to the earldom of Ferrers, as the eleventh earl, in 1907.<br>
<br>From 1855 to 1863 Shirley was tutor and mathematical lecturer at Wadham. It was during this period that he began to devote his greatest energy to historical study. A patient and impartial researcher, the master of a clear and dignified style, he came to be regarded by many of his contemporaries, in both England and Germany, as one of the ablest of the new kind of Oxford historian, employing carefully researched evidence and maintaining a detached and objective stance. In 1858 his edition of <span class="italic">Fasciculi Zizaniorum magistri Johannis Wyclif</span> was published in the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. His introduction attracted the admiration of historical students though it was savagely reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> by a reviewer who resented what he called Shirley's &#145;endeavour to exhibit Wycliffe as little of a Reformer as possible&#146;. Thereafter he commenced the preparation of a life of Wyclif which he did not live to complete. In 1865, however, he published a <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Original Works of John Wiclif</span> and in 1862 he edited for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> <span class="italic">Royal and other Historical Letters Illustrative of the Reign of Henry III</span>, the master of the rolls, Lord Romilly, thereby demonstrating continued confidence in the scholarship exhibited in Shirley's earlier volume for the series. There has been no edition of <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span> since Shirley's and it is still very widely used though it suffers somewhat, as one would expect, from the fact that the work was done as long ago as the mid-nineteenth century. His <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, on the other hand, has been rendered out of date by more recent research and scholarship.<br>
<br>Shirley's theological views underwent considerable change and began to lean more towards the opinions of the Tractarians. Having been in his early days a disciple of Arnold, he ultimately came to regard &#145;undogmatic Christianity&#146; as a contradiction in terms. Finally, in May 1863, he preached in the university church a sermon&#151;which created a great impression at the time of its delivery and was subsequently published&#151;in which he sought to demonstrate the unreasonableness of Arnold's teaching. Two or three months after the delivery of this sermon he was made regius professor of ecclesiastical history and canon of Christ Church. His appointment met with general approval among people of very divergent views because he was regarded as scrupulously fair in controversy and free from party spirit and because of the mingled strength and simplicity of his character. He was one of the pioneers of the university extension movement, and played a prominent part in the early history of the founding of Keble College. His promising career was cut short at the age of thirty-eight. He died on 20 November 1866 at the Canon's House, Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>The theological position which Shirley occupied at the time of his death was still regarded by him as a provisional one, as he believed that any moral or intellectual position should always be open to revision. In addition to the works already mentioned, he published a lecture, <span class="italic">Scholasticism</span>, delivered before the University of Oxford in 1866. After his death a small volume of his writings, edited by William Bright and entitled <span class="italic">Some Account of the Church in the Apostolic Age</span>, was published by the Clarendon Press.<br>
