<span class="headword">Baker,  Thomas</span>  (1656&#150;1740), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born at Crook Hall, Lanchester, co. Durham, on 14 September 1656, the second of the six children of George Baker (<i>d</i>. 1677), of Crook, and his wife, Margaret Forster, of Edderstone. He was educated at the free school in Durham under the Revd Thomas Battersby, and in June 1674, at the age of seventeen, he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, which, but for a three-year period in the north-east in the late 1680s, was to be his home for the rest of his life. He graduated BA in 1678 and proceeded MA in 1681, and in 1680 he was elected Ashton fellow. Early in 1685, like Joshua Barnes and Matthew Prior, he contributed to a collection of poems by members of the University of Cambridge on the occasion of the death of Charles II and the accession of James II, <span class="italic">Moestissimae ac laetissimae academiae Cantabrigiensis</span>. Ordained deacon on 20 December 1685, he was ordained priest on 9 December 1686. In June 1687 he was appointed rector of Long Newton in the diocese of Durham by Bishop Nathaniel Crewe, a living he had to relinquish on 1 August 1690 because he refused to take the oaths to the new king, holding that his oath to James II was sacred and demanded unconditional loyalty. However, while at Long Newton he had resented what he felt to be Bishop Crewe's opportunism, and had strongly disapproved of James's attempts at Catholicizing England; although a nonjuror he continued to hold communion with the established church and was certainly not a Jacobite.<br>
<br>As he had acquired his BD degree in 1688, just before the revolution, Baker did not simultaneously lose his fellowship. He lived on as a full and regular member of the college, but the prospect of a career in the church was over. Apart from being personally disappointed, over the next decade Baker came to be increasingly alarmed at the growth of latitudinarianism and deism, clearly connected with the developments in science and philosophy. He was a conservative Anglican clergyman who felt that this dangerous spirit of modernity of the post-revolution era had to be opposed. To this end he thoroughly prepared himself to write a book that would bring out the essential inadequacy of human knowledge and the fatal consequences of an overvaluing of human reason, emphasizing instead the need for a humble and reverent belief in revelation as our only certainty. He was a well-informed amateur, not a scientist or a philosopher, and his <span class="italic">Reflections upon Learning</span> (1699), while evidently touching a chord with the general reader&#151;it went through eight editions before 1760&#151;met with severe criticism from specialists. Although the book was published anonymously Baker became involved in an acrimonious controversy over it with the geologist and physician John Woodward, and this unpleasant experience clearly played a part in his decision to turn his attention to more congenial subjects.<br>
<br>In the first decade of the eighteenth century Baker began a thorough study of the past, especially that of his college and of his university. For a nonjuror and antiquarian scholar at that period Cambridge was not the most congenial environment, yet Baker came to be one of the best informed historical and antiquarian scholars of his day. Not only was he the expert on St John's College, he was also familiar with the holdings of the other college libraries and the university library. He was sent material by scholars and friends from all over England, and he had access to books and manuscripts from some of the best collections in the country, including those of Harley, Thomas and Richard Rawlinson, John Bagford, John Strype, Thomas Hearne, White Kennett, Francis Peck, Humfrey Wanley, and the library of Bishop John Moore of Ely, which came to Cambridge in 1715. In the course of the years he transcribed many original documents, printed and manuscript, which he saw as an indispensable research tool for his work. Although he had completed the first draft of a history of St John's College by the end of 1705, he refrained from publishing it, fearful of adverse reactions in his own circle. Similarly in the early 1730s he abandoned the &#145;Athenae Cantabrigienses&#146;, a comprehensive history of Cambridge University like Anthony Wood's work on Oxford, because, cautious and perfectionist as he was, he had become daunted by the extent and the difficulty of the task. None the less, he continued to collect material, and ultimately there were forty-two volumes of transcripts. He also accumulated a valuable library of some 5000 printed books and manuscripts. Apart from works by and about St John's and Cambridge men, and an impressive number of bibliographical reference works, emphases in his library were early printed books, and the history of the church and the state, especially in the sixteenth century. Baker was a bibliophile, but a utilitarian one. He spent much time carefully correcting, repairing, and supplementing the defective and incomplete books and manuscripts that he, as a book collector of modest means, often had to be contented with. His letters, the preliminary pages and margins of his books and manuscripts, and his interleaved copy of Andrew Maunsell's 1595 catalogue abundantly illustrate his expertise as a bibliographer.<br>
<br>Baker's extensive correspondence makes clear that he was at the centre of a network of some forty scholars and book collectors from many different backgrounds, and that in this way he played a very important role in the world of historical and antiquarian scholarship. Eirenical and undogmatic, unlike his fellow nonjuror and Oxford friend Thomas Hearne, he was naturally moderate and had a gift for nuance unusual in the ideologically polarized climate of the time. In his communications with other scholars Baker was a public-spirited man with a lofty ideal of serving the cause of learning, alongside the practical consideration of obtaining information for his own work. He had a deep reverence for the past and he came to idealize certain parts of it. Yet as a historian he also had a great respect for facts. Hence the openness and fairness in his accounts of such&#151;for most nonjurors&#151;&#145;suspect&#146; figures as William Prynne and Gilbert Burnet and hence also his constant insistence on the need for original documents as the basis of history writing. He hated frivolousness, inaccuracy, and speculation in a historian, and for that reason he dismissed such foreign writers as Gregorio Leti and the historical writings of such English authors as Francis Bacon and Sir William Temple as insufficiently based on authentic material.<br>
<br>Baker's only publication as a historical and antiquarian scholar, a reprint of Bishop John Fisher's <span class="italic">Funeral Sermon of Margaret Countess of Richmond and Derby</span>, appeared in 1708, with a long and interesting preface. Both here and in his college history, his treatment of the founders and early benefactors of the college reveals his admiration for their orthodoxy, firmness, and integrity, and there is a clear element of identification on his part with these heroes of a glorious past, and also of justification of his own nonjuring position. Baker himself was a benefactor of the college. After the death of his eldest brother, George, in 1699 he had become actively involved in the management of the leasehold collieries of the Baker family in the Durham area, and mainly with the proceeds from this family business he founded the six Baker exhibitions at St John's in 1710.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1717 Baker was officially deprived of his fellowship because he refused to take the oath of abjuration. Baker, for whom loyalty to the college had always been a major driving force and who was by now sixty, experienced this as a disgrace, and the event had a traumatic effect on him. Between 1717 and his death in 1740 he went through all his books and manuscripts and branded them with the words &#145;Thomas Baker Collegii Johannis Socius Ejectus&#146;. Although in practical terms the change was not so great, as he was allowed to keep his rooms in the college, he was so bitter and disillusioned that he seriously considered leaving St John's and Cambridge for good. However, both had become too much part of his life for him to be able to take that drastic step. He had not been away from Cambridge very often, in spite of pressing invitations from several of his friends to visit them in London, Oxford, or elsewhere. There had been the necessary business visits to the north-east, which he always tried to combine with work among the Durham collections. In 1709 he had spent some time transcribing material in the state paper office in London, and occasionally he went over to Ely to search the episcopal registers there, but from 1717 onward he led a more and more retired life, spending his days among his books and manuscripts, copying material from the collections of others, and writing letters to his many friends and acquaintances. As more of his Cambridge friends dropped away he kept to his rooms, going out only sporadically for a walk in the garden or a visit to the coffee house. On 2 July 1740 he died of a stroke, at St John's, at the age of eighty-three, and three days later he was buried in the ante-chapel of St John's College next to the tomb of Hugh Ashton, one of the earliest benefactors of the college; he had never married. His library, preserved at St John's and at Cambridge University Library, stands as an impressive monument to the piety and learning of this modest and conscientious scholar.<br>
