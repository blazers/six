<span class="headword">Hurley,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1354), <span class="occ">master carpenter</span>, is first recorded <i>c</i>.1315 in the exchequer plea rolls, among a list of London craftsmen acting as &#145;sureties&#146; on behalf of imprisoned masons employed at the king's manor of Eltham, Kent. Although no works can be associated with Hurley before 1322/3, his status and income must already have been substantial for him to act as a financial guarantor in 1315. In 1322/3 Hurley's name appears in the royal accounts for works at the Tower of London and at Westminster Palace, where between 1323 and 1325 he was employed upon St Stephen's Chapel. Thereafter it is possible to trace Hurley's career as a designer and overseer of major carpentry structures undertaken for royal, noble, urban, and ecclesiastical patrons; his achievements made him a typical member of a high-status artisan class which was closely associated with court culture and aristocratic households and allow him a place in the first rank of English craftsmen of the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>As master carpenter at Westminster, Hurley's tasks at the palace chapel included the erection of scaffolding and work tables, designing the roof, the complex timber vault, and later (in 1351) the choir stalls. As was customary, the structural carpentry was prefabricated, all timbers marked, and the whole stored until the time of assembly. However, political circumstances in Edward II's reign and the resulting hiatus of works at St Stephen's Chapel delayed the erection of Hurley's ornate vault and roof until 1345&#150;8, some twenty years after their original fabrication. In the meantime, Hurley undertook carpentry works for Edward II's favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger, at Caerphilly Castle, where he may well have designed the great hall roof, <i>c</i>.1325/6.<br>
<br>In 1336 Hurley was appointed for life to be Edward III's chief carpenter at the Tower and the overseer of all works of carpentry in the king's castles south of the Trent; in that capacity he was responsible for maintenance and transport of the siege engines, as well as domestic works such as Edward III's new chapel and chamber in the privy palace at Westminster, begun in 1342. Before the king's grandiose projects at Windsor, Hurley was engaged by the city of London to work on the Guildhall Chapel and received in 1331&#150;3 the large payment of &pound;8 14<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. for his services. At this time, John Pulteney, mayor of London, lent money to the Guildhall for repairs and also built himself a grand residence at Penshurst, Kent. Because of Hurley's employment at the Guildhall when Pulteney was mayor (1330&#150;37), it has been suggested that Hurley may have designed the great roof of the hall; however, this must remain only a tempting speculation.<br>
<br>Hurley's work at Ely is documented with certainty from 1334 until 1354, but considerable disagreement remains as to what role, if any, he played in devising the ingenious support system for the octagonal lantern, with its span of just over 70 feet. The general dates of construction can be firmly established between 1322, when the Norman crossing tower collapsed, and 1340/41, when the lantern windows were glazed. How early Hurley was employed at Ely cannot be resolved because of lacunae in the accounts for the critical years 1326 to 1334. It is known, however, that the stone octagon, which provides grooves for seating the framing, was finished in 1328 and archaeological evidence demonstrates that the masonry and carpentry must have been designed together. The sacrist rolls for 1322/3 name several carpenters and masons, including an anonymous <i>quidam</i> (&#145;someone&#146;) who came from London to ordain the new work and who was paid a total of 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., that is, half a master's normal salary of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. to 7<i>s</i>. a week (which was Hurley's salary as chief carpenter at Windsor). Efforts have been made to identify Hurley with this unnamed Londoner, in a desire to credit him with the octagon and its brilliant engineering, but the documents cannot support this interpretation. But the sources do permit the assigning to Hurley of the tierceron (lower) vault of the crossing which conceals the structural framing of the lantern and which was painted in 1334/5; also the upper star-patterned vault of the lantern and the roof of the entire &#145;campanile&#146;.<br>
<br>At Windsor Castle, where Edward III provided a model for the international chivalry of Europe, Hurley was engaged in various projects until his death in 1354. His largest work there was certainly the tournament pavilion, or &#145;domus&#146; of the Round Table, erected between 1344 and 1345. The purchase of 40,000 tiles and vast quantities of laths, pegs, and nails demonstrate that this immense &#145;house&#146; was to be roofed, at least partially, in order to provide Edward's court with a sheltered space to observe the jousting. The sources, however, do not indicate the plan, or, indeed, whether the structure was ever actually completed. Apart from this romantic project, Hurley, assisted by his warden, William Herland, was responsible for carpentry works in general and particularly for the choir stalls of St George's Chapel (<i>c</i>.1350&#150;52). Hurley had a chamber in Windsor Castle and also a &#145;house&#146; where it was said that he &#145;turns the chapiters [capitals] for the stalls&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the King's Works</span>, 1.873, n. 4). As well as his salary, robe, and privileges as a member of the king's household, Hurley received &pound;1 annually from the Ely fabric accounts until his death in 1354.<br>
