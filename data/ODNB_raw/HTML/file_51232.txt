<span class="headword">Milchsack <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Duden]</span>,  Lisalotte <span class="st"> [Lilo]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">promoter of Anglo-German relations</span>, was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the daughter of Dr Paul Duden (1868&#150;1954), an industrial chemist, and his wife, Johanna Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nebe (1875&#150;1947). Her grandfather was the lexicographer Konrad Duden (1829&#150;1911), author of the Duden dictionary. She studied history at the universities of Frankfurt, Geneva, and Amsterdam before marrying Hans Milchsack (<i>d</i>. 1984), a D&uuml;sseldorf businessman and the owner of an inland shipping navigation company; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>The Milchsacks were early opponents of the Nazi regime: in January 1932 Hans walked out in protest during a meeting at the Industrieclub in D&uuml;sseldorf where Hitler was speaking, and as early as 1935 Lilo was telling her English friends that Hitler's policies were leading to war. During the war her husband was able to help some of the Dutch workers in his factory in the Netherlands, and in 1945, because of his anti-Nazi record, he was appointed burgomaster of D&uuml;sseldorf-Wittlaer by the Americans.<br>
<br>In 1947 Lilo Milchsack was introduced to Robert Birley, educational adviser to the military governor of the British zone from 1947 to 1949, and when she began holding meetings in 1948 with the idea of forming some kind of association, Birley, who by now had moved from Berlin to D&uuml;sseldorf, was a great support. The Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft (Anglo-German Association) was founded in her house in Wittlaer in March 1949 out of a desire for reconciliation between Germany and England, and with the aim that Germany should rebuild a democratic society through studying British institutions, with the help of close personal contacts with Britain. As Birley put it in 1947: &#145;we can offer the strength of our own traditions to Germany &hellip; Germans now &hellip; hunger for contacts with the outside world, from which they have cut themselves off for so long&#146;  (Uhlig, 167). The association was intended as an informal and independent political forum, where leading German and English politicians, journalists, academics, and others prominent in public life could meet and hold joint discussions. As a means of encouraging frank discussion, she established the rule that names would not be mentioned in press reports.<br>
<br>Lilo Milchsack was director of the Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft from 1949 to 1977 and chairperson from 1977 to 1982. She organized in 1950 the first of what became annual four-day conferences at K&ouml;nigswinter, on the Rhine, south of Bonn: the theme of the first conference was social work and that of the second press responsibility. Although Birley had returned to England in 1949 to take up his appointment as headmaster of Eton College, he tried to attend every K&ouml;nigswinter conference, and he chaired many of them. Over the years the conferences covered more general topics such as East&#150;West relations and the Atlantic alliance. Lilo Milchsack also started &#145;Young K&ouml;nigswinter&#146; conferences, to bring together young people in their twenties from the two countries in order to develop mutual understanding. The K&ouml;nigswinter conferences were described by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1980 as &#145;a kind of college of higher education in politics&#146;. He also said that &#145;at K&ouml;nigswinter you have always been able to balance intellectual potential and warmth of heart, in short, to create a human atmosphere&#146;  (Uhlig, 200). This was largely because of the strength of Lilo Milchsack's personality and vision and the combination of her organizational ability and her gift for friendship.<br>
<br>Lilo Milchsack retired as chairperson in 1982 but remained as honorary chair for the rest of her life, and she continued to participate in the conferences. She was awarded the Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz in 1959 by the German government, and, after being appointed honorary CBE in 1958 and honorary CMG in 1968, she was created an honorary DCMG in 1972, the first German so appointed. As Sir Alec Douglas-Home said in 1971, &#145;Germany and Britain started this century in discord. We enter its last quarter in total trust&#146;  (Uhlig, 158). The K&ouml;nigswinter conferences played a large part in the development of this trust. Lilo Milchsack died on 7 August 1992 in D&uuml;sseldorf.<br>
