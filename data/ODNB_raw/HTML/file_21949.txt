<span class="headword">Percy,  Josceline</span>  (1784&#150;1856), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the fourth son of Algernon Percy, second Baron Lovaine of Alnwick (1750&#150;1830), and afterwards (1790) first earl of Beverley, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21943/', "Hugh Percy, first duke of Northumberland")</script>. He was born in London on 29 January 1784. His mother was Isabella Susannah (1750&#150;1812), second daughter of Peter Burrell of Beckenham, Kent, and sister of Peter, first Baron Gwydyr. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21941/', "Henry Percy (1785&#150;1825)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21946/', "Hugh Percy (1784&#150;1856)")</script> were his younger and twin brothers respectively. Percy entered the navy in February 1797, on the <i>Sanspareil</i>, flagship of Lord Hugh Seymour. In 1801 he was moved into the <i>Amphion</i>, in which he went to the Mediterranean in 1803, when he followed Nelson and Hardy to the <i>Victory</i>; in August he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Medusa</i> with Captain (afterwards Sir John) Gore. In her he assisted in the capture of the Spanish treasure ships on 5 October 1804. His commission was confirmed to 30 April 1804.<br>
<br>In 1806 Percy was in the <i>Diadem</i> with Sir Home Riggs Popham at the capture of Cape Town. He was promoted on 13 January to command the brig <i>Espoir</i>, and was posted the same day to the Dutch ship <i>Bato</i>, reported to be in Simon's Bay. The <i>Bato</i>, however, was found to have been effectually destroyed, and as the <i>Espoir</i> had meantime sailed for England, Percy had to return to the <i>Diadem</i> as a volunteer. On 4 March the French 46-gun frigate <i>Volontaire</i> came into Table Bay, ignorant of the capture of the Cape. She was seized, commissioned by Percy as a British warship, and sent to St Helena, whence she took charge of the convoy to England. Percy's two promotions were confirmed, dating respectively from 22 January and 25 September 1806.<br>
<br>From 1806 to 1820 Percy was tory MP for his father's pocket borough, Beer Alston, Devon. In 1807 in command of the <i>Comus</i> (22 guns), he assisted, under Sir Samuel Hood, in the occupation of Madeira; and in 1808, then captain of the <i>Nymphe</i> (36 guns), he carried the French commander, Junot, from Portugal to La Rochelle, according to the convention of Cintra, which stipulated that the beaten French forces be returned to France with all arms and equipment. In November 1810 he was appointed to the 36-gun frigate <i>Hotspur</i>, which he commanded on the coast of France, and afterwards at Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, for five years, returning to England at the end of 1815. Percy married, on 9 December 1820, Sophia Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 13 Dec 1875), daughter of Moreton Walhouse of Hatherton, Staffordshire; they had one son and three daughters. On 26 September 1831 he was made a CB, and was promoted rear-admiral on 23 November 1841. He commanded at the Cape of Good Hope from November 1841 until spring 1846. He became vice-admiral on 29 April 1851; and from June 1851 to June 1854 was commander-in-chief at Sheerness. He died at his country seat near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, on 19 October 1856.<br>
<br>Percy's younger brother <a name="cosubject_21963"></a><span class="headword">William Henry Percy</span>  (1788&#150;1855)<span class="occ"></span>, sixth son of the first earl of Beverley, born on 24 March 1788, entered the navy in May 1801 on the <i>Lion</i> (64 guns), in which he went to China. On his return in November 1802 he joined the <i>Medusa</i>, of which his elder brother was shortly afterwards appointed acting lieutenant. He was promoted commander on 2 May 1810, and during 1811 commanded the <i>Mermaid</i>, transporting troops to the Iberian peninsula. He was posted on 21 March 1812. In 1814 he commanded the <i>Hermes</i> (20 guns) on the coast of North America; but, on 4 April, having lost fifty men killed and wounded in an unsuccessful attack on Fort Bowyer, Mobile, his ship was set on fire to prevent her falling into enemy hands. After the peace of 1815 he had no further service in the navy, but was for many years a commissioner of excise. From 1818 to 1826 he was tory MP for Stamford, Lincolnshire, returned through the influence of the second marquess of Exeter, stepson of his maternal aunt, the dowager duchess of Hamilton. He became a rear-admiral on the retired list on 1 October 1846, and died, unmarried, at the home of his brother, the second earl of Beverley, 8 Portman Square, London, on 5 October 1855.<br>
