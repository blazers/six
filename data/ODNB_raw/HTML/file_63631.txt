<span class="headword">Stevenson,  John</span>  (1695&#150;1775), <span class="occ">rhetorician and university teacher</span>, few details survive concerning his origins, schooling, or personal life. Alexander Bower asserts only that he was educated at Edinburgh, that at the time of his appointment he was tutor to the family of Hamilton of Bargany, and that he never married  (Bower, 2.269&#150;70, 281). Upon his appointment at the University of Edinburgh he took over the chair in logic and rhetoric when its possessor, Colin Drummond, one of the old regents, transferred to the Greek chair. Stevenson later commented that he and Drummond soon faced &#145;broils and contention&#146; over the rights and proper methods to teach Greek poetry  (Sharp, 41). But despite this early conflict, Stevenson established himself as a prominent teacher, who was reasonably well paid, earning nearly &pound;150 per year  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.280).<br>
<br>Stevenson's teaching innovations included being among the first in Scotland to lecture in English on rhetoric, to replace scholastic logic with the epistemology of Locke, and to introduce into the rhetoric curriculum the study of <i>belles-lettres</i> and literary style. Alexander Carlyle described Stevenson's class structure as it was in the 1730s. In the morning Stevenson read selections from French and English literary critics, as well as Aristotle's <span class="italic">Poetics</span> and Longinus's <span class="italic">On the Sublime</span>. These readings were followed at midday with an abridgement of Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> and the Aristotelian logic of Heineccius, which Stevenson would explain and correct. In the afternoon he took up the history of philosophy, using Heinnecius's <span class="italic">Historia philosophica</span> as his textbook. In later years Stevenson appears to have discarded the history of philosophy as part of the course. Among his few surviving papers is an interesting and important collection of essays written by his students for presentation to the class between 1737 and 1750. The authors represent a good cross-section of the future educated &eacute;lite in Scotland, and they illustrate the topics he treated, including philosophical subjects, taste and literary criticism, and education. There also survives a brief set of notes taken by John Campbell on Stevenson's logic lectures (conducted in Latin, not English), in which he noted particularly the role of probability and the limitations of the understanding.<br>
<br>Despite these innovations Stevenson's academic career, in many respects, was very modest: he left no published works, and he was a relatively uninspiring presence in the classroom. The brief obituary in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> observed: &#145;His lectures were solid rather than brilliant, formal rather than penetrating. But, if he wanted the boldness of invention and genius, he possessed amply the advantages which flow from study and knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine and Review</span>, 4.560). In Carlyle's astute analysis the secret of Stevenson's success was his affability:<blockquote>By civility to his Students who began to think themselves men, as he treated them as Gentlemen, he drew their respect &amp; attention, &amp; as their minds were just ripening for science &amp; belles-lettres, his Lectures on Aristotle's poetics &amp; Longinus on the sublime, captivated our opening taste &amp; made us ascribe to them what was chiefly due to our own ripening understandings. (Carlyle, &#145;Recollections&#146;, 57)</blockquote>Accordingly, though he left no important book or original idea, Stevenson made a huge impact on his students. The moderate literati, including William Robertson, Hugh Blair, Thomas Somerville, and Alexander Carlyle; adherents of the popular party, such as John Erskine; and even occasional sceptics, such as James Boswell, all left powerful testimonies to the important place Stevenson had in their lives and intellectual outlooks.<br>
<br>On 19 January 1774 Stevenson submitted his resignation, and he and John Bruce were elected conjunct professors a week later  (Edinburgh town council records, 91.102, 107&#150;8). Stevenson retired at the end of the academic year, with Bruce superseding him  (Robertson to Wordie, 10 Oct 1775, Edinburgh City Archives). According to Bower, at the beginning of his tenure as principal, Robertson made a moving commendation of Stevenson before the logic class, in which he declared the class to be the foundation of all philosophy and a lifelong source of ideas. Stevenson's impact also extended beyond the classroom. As a member of the Rankenian Club, he associated with like-minded intellectuals such as Charles Mackie, Colin MacLaurin, Robert Wallace, and William Wishart, all of whom were engaged in an effort to liberalize Scottish cultural life and to create an educational environment appropriate for landed gentlemen. Stevenson gave his library to Edinburgh University, and died, in Edinburgh, in early September 1775.<br>
