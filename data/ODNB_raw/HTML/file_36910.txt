<span class="headword">Willcox, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1870&#150;1941), <span class="occ">physician and toxicologist</span>, was born on 18 January 1870 at Thorpe End, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, the eldest of the ten children of William Willcox (1844&#150;1906), master draper and town councillor, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Barnes. He was educated at Wymondham grammar school, Oakham (1876&#150;82), and at the Wyggeston School, Leicester (1882&#150;7). He then studied chemistry at University College, Nottingham (1887&#150;90), and at University College, London (1890&#150;91). After taking the degree of BSc at London University in 1892, he taught chemistry at Queenwood College, a private school in Hampshire. In 1895 he entered St Mary's Hospital medical school with a scholarship, and he qualified as LSA (1899), MB (1900, winning a gold medal), DPH (1900), and MD (1901). At St Mary's he was awarded the Cheadle gold medal and a scholarship in forensic medicine, and was lecturer on chemical pathology (1900&#150;30), medical registrar (1904&#150;6), lecturer on forensic medicine (1906&#150;35), physician to out-patients (1907&#150;13), physician (1913&#150;35), and consulting physician (1935&#150;41). He was admitted a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry (1901), MRCP (1905), and FRCP (1910). In 1901 Willcox married Mildred (<i>d</i>. 1953), the elder daughter of William Griffin, a farmer, of Clapton, Northamptonshire; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Willcox's connection with St Mary's Hospital (then the centre of modern forensic medicine), his double qualification as a physician and as a chemist, and his temperament fitted him admirably for the role of medico-legal expert. He was junior analyst to the Home Office (1904&#150;8), senior analyst (1908&#150;19, having succeeded Sir Thomas Stevenson), and medical adviser&#151;a post created at his own suggestion&#151;from 1919 until his death, when the title lapsed. One of his most brilliant achievements was the identification of hyoscine in the Crippen case (1910). In this and in other famous cases he was associated with Bernard Spilsbury. His work in the Seddon case (1912), the first in which the electrolytic Marsh&#150;Berzelius test for arsenic was applied quantitatively for forensic purposes, was a landmark in the history of toxicology. He gave evidence for the crown at the trials of Smith (the &#145;brides in the bath&#146; case, 1915), Greenwood (1920), and Armstrong (1922). He was an authority on drugs and poisons, and was described as the most deliberate and painstaking expert witness who ever stepped into the box; his testimony was rarely shaken.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Willcox served in Gallipoli and Mesopotamia as consulting physician to the forces, and his work in controlling the incidence of disease among British and Indian troops was said by Sir Stanley Maude to be equal to two divisions. As an honorary colonel in the Army Medical Service, he contributed to the improvements made to its organization and to military hygiene, was mentioned in dispatches four times, and was appointed CMG (1916), CB (1917), and KCIE (1921) in recognition of his wartime services.<br>
<br>After the war Willcox devoted more time to clinical medicine and built up a large consulting practice. In addition to his work at St Mary's Hospital he was senior physician to the London Fever Hospital and to St Luke's Hostel for the Clergy. He took a special interest in the rheumatic diseases and gave untiring assistance to the Empire Rheumatism Council, of which he was a co-founder in 1936. Industrial toxicology also engaged his attention, and the results of his wartime studies of cases of poisoning in munition workers and those engaged in the manufacture of aeroplanes were summarized in his Lettsomian (1919) and Lumleian (1931) lectures.<br>
<br>Between 1924 and 1926 Willcox was a member of the departmental committee on morphine and heroin addiction (Rolleston committee). Its report (1926) had an important influence on British drug policy, but did not support Willcox's strong views on the control of addicts. His interest in alcoholism and addiction led to the publication of several articles in the <span class="italic">British Journal of Inebriety</span>, and to joint authorship of a book, <span class="italic">Alcoholism in General Practice</span> (with A. E. Carver and T. Hunt, 1936). Other writings and lectures on forensic medicine, chemical pathology, and medicine appeared in medical journals and the transactions of societies over a period of nearly forty years.<br>
<br>Willcox was for many years visitor for the privy council to the examinations of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. He was president of the Harveian Society (1922), West London Medico-Chirurgical Society (1923), Society for the Study of Inebriety (1924&#150;7), Medico-Legal Society (1928&#150;9), Medical Society of London (1936&#150;7), and the section of pharmacology and therapeutics of the Royal Society of Medicine (1940&#150;41). In 1932 he was president of the section of forensic medicine of the British Medical Association and in 1935, when the association's annual meeting was held at Melbourne, he was president of the section of pharmacology, therapeutics, and anaesthetics. On that occasion the University of Melbourne conferred on him the honorary degree of MD. He was master of the Society of Apothecaries in 1935&#150;6, and was a knight of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>Known as Wilks to his friends, Willcox had a reputation for great kindness and generosity. In his profession he was known for his wide range of interests and exceptional industry. The fact that he was often working at his desk long after midnight did not prevent him from riding in the park before breakfast. He enjoyed cycling and riding to hounds, and took a great interest in the Royal Academy of Dancing, doing much to further its interests, particularly on the educational side. He was of robust build and enjoyed good health until March 1940, when he had a heart attack, followed by another a year later. Willcox continued to work until he suffered a sudden stroke and died at his house at 40 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 8 July 1941. There was a funeral service at St Marylebone parish church, followed by cremation at Golders Green, on 11 July.<br>
