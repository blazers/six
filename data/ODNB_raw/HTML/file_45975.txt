<span class="headword">Trickett, Sir  Henry Whittaker</span>  (1857&#150;1913), <span class="occ">slipper manufacturer</span>, was born on 23 July 1857 at Miller Barn Lane, Newchurch, Waterfoot, in the Rossendale valley, Lancashire, the eldest of five children of Henry Whittaker Trickett (1831&#150;1904), a journeyman woollen carpet printer, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whittaker (1832&#150;1886). At eight years of age, after a very brief education at the local church school, he went to work for his uncle, Joshua Trickett, who ran a small felt-printing works a mile or so from Waterfoot. Starting as a &#145;tier&#146; boy, supplying printers with colours, he subsequently completed a five-year apprenticeship at the age of twenty-two. Meantime, at Bethel Baptist Church, Waterfoot (where he was baptized on 7 January 1877, and where he later served as deacon, Sunday school superintendent, treasurer, and trustee), he met Elizabeth Alice, daughter of John Ormerod, a cotton weaver; they were married on 23 January 1879.<br>
<br>The Greenbridge carpet works, where Trickett worked, hit hard times, and his career took a different turn. In 1881 he became a commercial traveller for Gregory &amp; Co., one of the small slipper manufacturing concerns which had sprung up in the Waterfoot area in the 1870s and originated from the crude slippers of waste felt worn by block-printers for walking on carpets in the process of manufacture. Trickett stayed with Gregory &amp; Co. for less than two years, crucially learning that the footwear industry (then mainly concerned with boots and shoes) had entered a period of revolutionary change. Large-scale factory production, the emergence of wholesale and retail networks, the rising purchasing power of the working and middle classes, the possibilities of attaining volume sales in mass markets: such developments persuaded Trickett to set up on his own in 1882.<br>
<br>Trickett borrowed &pound;75 from relatives and rented an old weaving shop, measuring barely 10 by 15 yards, and with six employees started making slippers. A vigorous marketing campaign brought orders from all parts of the country. All profits were invested in specialized machinery or stocks of material. Within about twelve months Henry Trickett employed over sixty people. In 1889 he purchased Gaghills Mill, a large disused cotton mill in Burnley Road, Waterfoot, where he installed the latest American machinery: power presses, high-speed sewing machines, heel-fixing machinery. An export drive expanded his sales into Europe (previously supplied by German manufacturers) and the Far East. A decade later he leased the latest machinery from the newly formed and monopolistic British United Shoe Machinery Company. By 1900 the Gaghills factory, with a labour force of about 1000 people, was producing 72,000 pairs of slippers monthly. In 1913 1200 employees produced 2.5 million pairs of slippers annually. Others emulated Trickett, who was widely known as the Slipper King. By 1893 there were ten slipper firms in the Rossendale district and by 1900 thirteen, none of which failed before 1914. However, Trickett's was the largest firm, employing a third of all the district's slipper workers in 1900. Trickett paid close attention to design, new materials, and marketing, including eye-catching and humorous advertisements. He set up a chain of sales offices and depots across the UK, the white-dominated parts of the British empire, and the USA.<br>
<br>Trickett genuinely cared for his workers and for Rossendale. Continuity of employment, payment of better than average wages, and provision of clean working conditions, refreshment rooms, medical facilities, a training school, sick (1893) and holiday (1897) clubs, and a bowling green and gardens next to the mill&#151;as well as a terrace of houses and an arcade of shops in Waterfoot&#151;enhanced Trickett's good reputation, eased his labour relations, and facilitated the introduction of new machinery.<br>
<br>Trickett became a Liberal town councillor for Rawtenstall (of which Waterfoot was part) in 1891, and between 1898 and 1902 he served a record five times as mayor of the borough, being elected alderman in 1900. He declined offers to stand as a parliamentary candidate (supporting Sir William Mather's candidature in 1900) but between 1901 and 1913 he served variously as president of the Rossendale Liberal Association, vice-president of the Lancashire and Cheshire Free Trade League, vice-president of the Lancashire and Cheshire Liberal Federation, and JP. He was knighted in 1909.<br>
<br>Management of his business was entrusted by Trickett to five senior employees to whom he gave a share of net profits. In 1901 the firm was registered as H. W. Trickett Ltd. Trickett relinquished sole ownership for &pound;5335 in cash, &pound;40,000 in 5 per cent cumulative preference shares, and 31 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of &pound;18,100. His managers bought shares. However, Trickett retained control by limiting share sales and preserving the lifetime right to appoint and dismiss his fellow directors. Trickett died suddenly at the age of fifty-six on 3 August 1913, and was buried in the Baptist graveyard, Waterbarn. He was survived by his wife and two daughters and left an estate valued at &pound;120,907 gross.<br>
