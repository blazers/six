<span class="headword">Scot <span class="st"> [Scott]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1558&#150;1642), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and historian</span>, was the son of Robert Scot (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1605) from Mylndeane, Fife. He graduated MA from the University of St Andrews in 1586. By 1593 he was minister of Kennoway, Fife, and two years later he first attended the general assembly. The assembly of March 1596 appointed him a visitor in Dumfriesshire and in May Scot delivered a &#145;notable exhortation&#146; to the synod of Fife concerning the general assembly's invocation to renew the covenant with God  (Calderwood, 5.433). In February 1597 he was one of two ministers from Cupar presbytery chosen to meet representatives of the other presbyteries of Fife concerning questions from the king about ecclesiastical authority. In the autumn of 1600 he attended a conference of delegates from the synods with the king, at which the first Jacobean bishops were appointed, in the absence of the contingent from Fife. Having given him further commissions of visitation in 1600 and 1602, in the latter year the general assembly also appointed him &#145;to wait upon&#146; the Catholic earl of Huntly to instruct him and his family  (ibid., 6.166).<br>
<br>In 1604 Scot became minister of Cupar and became prominent in opposition to the king's episcopal policy. In April 1605, moderating the synod of Fife, he &#145;taught powerfullie against the corruptions&#146; in the kirk  (Calderwood, 6.276). Later that year he petitioned the king in favour of ministers imprisoned for holding an illegal general assembly at Aberdeen. In the summer of 1606 Scot and seven others, including Andrew and James Melville, were summoned to court. In July, after subscribing a written protest at the Scottish parliament against the restitution of bishops, the eight went south. Discussions at Hampton Court focused on the Aberdeen assembly of 1605 and Scot is recorded as having &#145;declairit his judgement solidlie in few wordis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 660). In common with his colleagues he was warded with a bishop, in his case that of Peterborough. He remained in London until May 1607, and in the meantime various English nobles tried to engage him as their chaplain. Allowed to go home because his wife, Janet Smyth, was ill, he was then confined to his parish, although in the interim he had been appointed by the crown as &#145;constant moderator&#146; of Cupar presbytery, an innovation to which he was opposed.<br>
<br>During 1608 and 1609 Scot corresponded with James Melville, his &#145;loving and deere Father&#146; in exile in England  (Calderwood, 6.785). In spite of his confinement he attended the general assembly in 1608 and a conference at Falkland in 1609 designed to resolve ecclesiastical disputes. In July 1614 his confinement was lifted, yet he did not return to the synod of Fife until 1622 in protest at its being presided over by the archbishop of St Andrews. In Edinburgh at the time of parliament in June 1617 he was one of fifty-five ministers to subscribe a declaration in favour of ecclesiastical independence. An attempt to have him appointed minister of Edinburgh was blocked by the crown because of his opposition to its ecclesiastical policy, which had led to the assumption that he had been the author of David Calderwood's <span class="italic">Perth Assemblie</span>, asserting the illegality of the general assembly of 1618.<br>
<br>Scot spent the rest of his life out of the political spotlight. In 1620 he erected the spire of Cupar parish church which is an enduring monument to his ministry there, as is the fine silver communion plate, commissioned in the same year and in regular use at the end of the twentieth century. In 1622 he published in the Netherlands <span class="italic">The Course of Conformitie</span>, a dialogue concerning the decayed state of the kirk. Three years later David Dalgleish became his assistant and went on to marry his daughter, Barbara. In his declining years Scot wrote <span class="italic">Apologetical narration of the state and government of the Kirk of Scotland since the Reformation</span>, which concentrated on the period between 1590 and 1633, recounting events from an anti-episcopalian and anti-Erastian standpoint. It was not published until 1846, although Calderwood used the manuscript. Scot died on 20 May 1642 aged about eighty-four and was buried beside the church he had served for over forty years. He was survived by his wife.<br>
