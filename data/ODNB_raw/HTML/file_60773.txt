<span class="headword">Scott,  George Gilbert</span>  (1839&#150;1897), <span class="occ">architect and scholar</span>, was born on 8 October 1839 at 20 Spring Gardens, London, the eldest of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24869/', "Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811&#150;1878)")</script>, architect, and Caroline Oldrid (1811&#150;1872), daughter of John Oldrid, draper, of Boston, Lincolnshire. Scott won a scholarship to Eton College in 1852. In 1857 he began a three-year articled pupillage in his father's office in Spring Gardens, after which he worked there as an assistant. Friends then persuaded him to enter Cambridge University and Scott went up to Jesus College in 1863 and in 1866 headed the first class in the moral sciences tripos. In 1868 Scott won the Burney prize for an essay published in 1870 as <span class="italic">The argument of the intellectual character of the first cause, as affected by recent investigations of physical science</span>. In 1872 he was elected a fellow of Jesus College, but was obliged to resign after four months owing to his marriage that year to Ellen King Sampson (1854&#150;1953), daughter of William King Sampson, of Eastbourne, Sussex.<br>
<br>On his nomination form for election as a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (declared void in 1878), Scott stated he was in independent architectural practice from 1863, but he had continued to assist his father, who passed on to him the restoration of Cheddleton church, Staffordshire (1863&#150;6), and the restoration and enlargement of the hall and combination room at Peterhouse, Cambridge (1868&#150;71), in both of which he used William Morris and his firm for decoration and stained glass. Scott's early career, however, is difficult to document, as all his papers and drawings were destroyed in a fire in 1870 in the house in Cecil Street, London, off the Strand, where he had rooms, a disaster that may have encouraged more freedom in designing but also affected his health. Scott subsequently opened an office at 7 Duke Street, Portland Place, while in 1872 he and his wife moved into 26 Church Row, Hampstead.<br>
<br>George Frederick Bodley, his father's former pupil, was the principal influence on Scott's own architecture. With Bodley and Thomas Garner, and J. D. Sedding, Scott was responsible for changing the direction of English church design in the 1870s by using English and late styles of Gothic instead of thirteenth-century and continental models, and he went further than his friend Bodley by defending the despised Perpendicular. This was evident in his cemetery chapel at Ramsgate, Kent (1869&#150;71), and the additions to Cattistock church in Dorset (1872&#150;6); but the building which became most influential was his masterpiece, the church of St Agnes, Kennington Park, London (1874&#150;91; dem.). Designed for Anglo-Catholic worship and the English liturgy, the spare Late Gothic interior, with its characteristic arch mouldings disappearing into the piers, was filled with furnishings about which there was &#145;the mysterious but unmistakable smell of Renaissance that hung about his most Gothic details&#146;  (H. S. Goodhart-Rendel, &#145;The work of Temple Moore&#146;, <span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 35, 26 May 1928, 478). St Mark's, New Milverton, Leamington Spa (1876&#150;9), was designed in a similar style but All Hallows, Southwark (1879&#150;92; dem.), was better-known and combined the refinement of Late Gothic with the toughness of the mid-Victorian urban church. Scott's other churches included that at Eastmoors, Yorkshire (1881&#150;2), and what is now the Roman Catholic cathedral at Norwich (1882&#150;1910), built by the fifteenth duke of Norfolk.<br>
<br>Scott was described by E. W. Godwin as &#145;a master and a leader in the &#147;Queen Anne&#148; revival&#146; as he showed in his domestic architecture  (<span class="italic">British Architect</span>, 9, 5 April 1878, 156). His only country house was Garboldisham Manor, Norfolk (<i>c</i>.1868&#150;1873; dem.), but he designed a group of houses in Westbourne Park, Hull, and several vicarages. He also undertook work at Oxford and Cambridge. At Pembroke College, Cambridge, he built a new block (1879&#150;93) in a Renaissance manner and enlarged Wren's chapel with rare tact and sensitivity at a time when few were prepared to defend classical work of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Scott also designed wallpaper and furniture and, with Bodley and Garner, set up the firm of Watts &amp; Co. <i>c</i>.1874 to produce their own designs. Scott moved in artistic circles: the architect Alexander Thomson met him at a dinner in 1871, when he &#145;made his appearance in black knee breeks black silk stockings high heeled shoes with large buckles, blue coat, yellow vest white neck cloth with stiffner and frilled shirt&#151;he is one of the Queen Ann folks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alexander Thomson Society Newsletter</span>, 11, October 1994, 11).<br>
<br>Scott's diffidence towards professional practice was encouraged by a large inheritance following Sir Gilbert Scott's death in 1878. He edited his father's <span class="italic">Personal and Professional Recollections</span> (1879), and in 1881 published his <span class="italic">Essay on the history of English church architecture prior to the separation from the Roman obedience</span>; the previous year he had shocked members of his family by becoming a Roman Catholic. Scott's later years were clouded by mental instability and scandal, and he gradually withdrew from practice. In 1883 his behaviour required him to be confined in the Bethlem Hospital, from which he escaped to Rouen. In 1884, following a public examination under the 1862 <span class="roman">Lunacy Act</span> resulting from a petition by his wife and brothers, he was found to be of unsound mind although, as he wrote to a friend,<blockquote>here in France I have been examined by the official medicals, and have been pronounced with equal certainty to be perfectly sane, and quite competent to manage both other people's affairs and my own. I am thus insane in the Kingdom of England and sane in the Republic of France. (Scott to Edward Walford, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 May 1884, 14)</blockquote>Scott returned to England in 1885, but he had to be confined in St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, in 1888 and again in 1891&#150;2. His loyal pupil and &#145;coadjutor&#146; Temple Lushington Moore (1856&#150;1920) finished Scott's outstanding jobs other than the Norwich church, which was completed by his brother John Oldrid Scott. His wife moved the children to Hollis Street Farm, Ninfield, Sussex, in 1889 and Scott spent his last years in rented accommodation in London. He died on 6 May 1897 from acute cirrhosis of the liver and heart disease while a permanent resident in the Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras, designed by his father.<br>
<br>When admitted to St Andrew's Hospital in 1891, Scott was described as &#145;short of stout build, muscular and well nourished &hellip; Features regular, eyes grey, pupils equal. Hair bald on top, hair, beard, moustache and whiskers grey&#146;  (St Andrew's Hospital records). He was buried on 11 May 1897 in the Hampstead additional burial-ground in London. Of his six children, four survived infancy. One son was the radiologist Sebastian Gilbert Scott and the two other sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35987/', "Sir Giles Gilbert Scott")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60774/', "Adrian Gilbert Scott")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35987/', "Scott, Sir Giles Gilbert")</script>], achieved distinction as architects.<br>
