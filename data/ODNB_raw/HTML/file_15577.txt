<span class="headword">King,  John Duncan</span>  (1788&#150;1863), <span class="occ">army officer and landscape painter</span>, was born in the city of Waterford, Ireland, on 4 November 1788 and entered the army as an ensign in the 71st regiment in August 1806. He purchased a lieutenancy on 18 February 1808, before exchanging into the 3rd battalion, 1st (or Royal) regiment, with which he saw active service from July 1809 in the Walcheren expedition, and later that year in the Peninsular War. He was present at the battle of Busaco on 27 September 1810. On 13 June 1811 he transferred to the 7th Royal Fusiliers, engaging in various skirmishes that autumn. In 1813 he fought at the battles of Vitoria and the Pyrenees, receiving a severe wound in the right shoulder on 28 July 1813. For this he received additional pay and an eighteen-month pension. On 18 January 1815 he married Sally Tindal, with whom he had four sons, and who predeceased him. He returned to overseas duty in May 1815, was present at the capture of Paris, and remained with the army of occupation until 1818. On 20 April 1820 he exchanged to the 8th foot on half pay. Influenced by Claude Lorrain, he pursued his interest in landscape painting, exhibiting views of Spain and Portugal at the Royal Academy in 1824. He studied under Horace Vernet in Paris in 1825. On 14 May 1829 he returned briefly to regimental duty with the 75th foot, purchasing a captaincy on 16 March 1830. However, he soon retired, going on half pay on 28 December 1830; he then travelled, painting views of India, Tahiti, France, Ireland, and England. Between 1824 and 1858 he exhibited eighteen paintings at the Royal Academy, thirty-nine at the British Institution, and two at the Society of British Artists, Suffolk Street. In March 1851 King was made a military knight of Windsor, and he lived at 17 Lower Ward, Windsor Castle, until his death there on 21 August 1863. Since then his work has been largely forgotten and he is not represented in any major British collection.<br>
