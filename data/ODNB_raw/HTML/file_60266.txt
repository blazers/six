<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Horovitz <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hooker]</span>,  Frances Margaret</span>  (1938&#150;1983), <span class="occ">poet and broadcaster</span>, was born on 13 February 1938 in Princess Beatrice Hospital, Kensington, London, the elder daughter of Frank Edward Hooker (1904&#150;1975), a management accountant for ASEA Electric, and his wife, Margaret Alice Dorothy Scroggs (<i>b</i>. 1907), daughter of Arthur William Scroggs, a valet to Sir Frederick Williams Taylor. In 1941 the family moved from London to Nottingham, where during the war Frank Hooker was manager of a munitions factory. They returned in 1947 to live in Walthamstow, east London, where from 1949 to 1956 Frances attended the Walthamstow High School for Girls. School trips to the Old Vic and a sixth-form visit to Italy introduced her to Shakespeare's plays and Renaissance painting. By the time she entered Bristol University in 1956 to read English and drama, she was determined to become an artist. Graduating from Bristol in 1959, she went on to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where, between 1959 and 1961, she starred in a number of student productions. In 1960 she met the poet Michael William Horovitz (<i>b</i>. 1935), and became one of a group of Blake enthusiasts connected with Horovitz's radical journal <span class="italic">New Departures</span>; on 12 June 1964 she married him in London. They went on to live at 29 Colville Terrace, Notting Hill, London.<br>
<br>As a young actress Frances Horovitz took small parts in West End productions and spent time in repertory, but her beautiful speaking voice soon caught the ear of the poet George MacBeth, who cast her in his anti-nuclear satire <span class="italic">The Doomsday Show</span> (1963), later employing her as a principal reader in the poetry programmes he was producing for the BBC. Her unsurpassed performances as a poetry reader for radio, directed first by George MacBeth and after 1976 by Fraser Steel, ceased only with the illness that preceded her death. She came to feel that poetry reading was a different discipline from acting&#151;purer, more austere, and without egotistical self-projection. In 1975 she acted in the first performance of Ted Hughes's <span class="italic">Cave Birds</span> at the Ilkley Festival, soon afterwards beginning the long professional partnership with the literary biographer Robert Gittings that established her as one of finest interpreters of Keats and Hardy.<br>
<br>Frances Horovitz's performances, live and on the radio, won her thousands of admirers, but as a poet she eschewed self-dramatization and instead drew on an instinctive, entirely uncompromised spirituality. In December 1964 she paid the first of many visits to the Carmelite priory in Aylesford, Kent. The attraction was a circle of young artists brought together by Father Brocard Sewell under the auspices of the <span class="italic">Aylesford Review</span>. Henry Williamson, who considerably influenced her, was the guiding spirit of this group which shared a reverence for the natural world and a belief that the disciplines of art had to be commensurate with the disciplines of the spirit. When, after her marriage, she began to write poetry, the <span class="italic">Aylesford Review</span> became her first publisher. <span class="italic">Poems</span> by Frances Horovitz was printed, in an edition of 526 copies, by St Albert's Press in 1967. <span class="italic">Poems</span> was followed by <span class="italic">The High Tower</span>, published by New Departures in 1970. Ten years then lapsed before Enitharmon Press brought out her third collection, <span class="italic">Water over Stone</span>, in 1980. It was during this hiatus that her poetry deepened considerably. By the time <span class="italic">Snow Light, Water Light</span> (Bloodaxe Books) was put into her hand on her deathbed in 1983, her lyrics &#145;Rain&#151;Birdoswald&#146; and &#145;Flowers&#146; had established her as a lasting poet in the English mystical tradition of Traherne and George Herbert.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Frances Horovitz augmented her slender income by teaching English and drama part-time in a number of London schools, her favourite being the Carlyle Grammar School for Girls in Fulham. In the summer of 1970 she and her husband managed to buy Mullions, a tiny semi-detached cottage in the Slad valley, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, while still retaining their flat in London. On 27 April 1971 their son Adam was born in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London. With the establishment of the Arvon writing centres in the 1970s, she became a regular tutor at Lumb Bank in Yorkshire and Totleigh Barton in Devon. Shortly before Christmas 1980, with nine-year-old Adam, she went to live with the poet Roger Garfitt (<i>b</i>. 1944) in north-east England, spending much of that winter and the next in a farmhouse near the Roman fort of Birdoswald. Through the Li-Yuan-Chia (LYC) Gallery in Cumberland, she contributed poems to <span class="italic">Wall</span> (LYC Press, 1981) on the theme of Hadrian's Wall. Another LYC collaboration with Winifred Nicholson and others resulted in the landscape anthology <span class="italic">Presences of Nature</span> (Carlisle Museum and Art Gallery, 1982).<br>
<br>In July 1982, after a spring trip to Orkney, Frances Horovitz and Roger Garfitt moved to 2 Mount Pleasant, St Weonards, overlooking Orcop in Herefordshire. On the morning of their move, Frances learned that the pain she had been suffering in her ear was due to skin cancer. She went north again for a series of operations, but when these proved unsuccessful she was admitted in May 1983 to the Royal Marsden Hospital in Fulham, London. On 28 July her divorce from Michael Horovitz came through, enabling her to marry Roger Garfitt in her bedroom in St Weonards on 6 September 1983. Shortly afterwards she returned, much weakened, to the Royal Marsden Hospital, where she died on Sunday morning, 2 October 1983.<br>
<br>Frances Horovitz's death was mourned by thousands. After her funeral and burial in Orcop on Saturday, 8 October, memorial readings were held before huge audiences in Bristol and London. Two commemorative pamphlets were published: <span class="italic">Tenfold</span> (Martin Booth, 1983) and <span class="italic">A Celebration of and for Frances Horovitz</span> (New Departures, 1984). In 1985 Bloodaxe Books, in association with the Enitharmon Press, brought out her <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>. Remembering Frances in 1996, Roger Garfitt wrote:<blockquote>When I look back at Frances, I see that her beauty was all of a piece: her poetry, her voice, her manner, the clothes she wore, the very pots she used in her kitchen. Few of us achieve such unity. Yet it's important to see the fierceness in her poetry, the cutting through to the elemental. I see the last poems not as prophetic of her early death but as the culmination of her art&#151;the beautiful, quiet acceptance she had been working towards all her life.
