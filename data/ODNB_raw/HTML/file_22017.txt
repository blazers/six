<span class="headword">Peter the Wild Boy</span>  (<em>c.</em>1712&#150;1785), <span class="occ">curiosity</span>, was found in 1725 in the woods near Hamelin, about 25 miles from Hanover. In the words of contemporary pamphleteers, he was observed &#145;walking on his hands and feet, climbing trees like a squirrel, and feeding on grass and moss&#146;. In November 1725 he was taken to the house of correction at Celle, and in the same month was presented to George I, who was visiting Hanover. Peter then escaped and took refuge in a tree, which had to be cut down before he was recaptured. In the spring of 1726, by the king's command, he was brought to England and, according to contemporary accounts, was exhibited to the nobility. The boy, who appeared to be about fourteen years old, was baptized and committed to the care of the physician and satirist John Arbuthnot. Attempts were made to teach Peter to speak, without success. The question of how Peter came to be in the woods was fiercely debated in chapbooks and pamphlets. There was also much speculation about what sort of creature had nurtured him; possible animals included a sow, wolf, and bear.<br>
<br>Jonathan Swift, who arrived in London at about the same time, wrote to Thomas Tickell that Peter &#145;hath been half our Talk this fortnight&#146;  (16 April 1726, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.128). Swift also wrote a satirical pamphlet, <span class="italic">It Cannot Rain but it Pours</span>, which commented on London's fascination with the boy; Arbuthnot and Daniel Defoe provided similar investigations in their <span class="italic">The Most Wonderful Wonder</span> (1726) and <span class="italic">Mere Nature Delineated</span> (1726). Some of the more bizarre features of Swift's description, including Peter's neighing to express joy, were later applied by James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, for his theory of human development in <span class="italic">Of the Origin and Progress of Language</span> (1773&#150;92). Monboddo compared the wild boy with an orang-utang&#151;a species which he famously regarded as an uncivilized type of human being.<br>
<br>Following the death of Queen Caroline, who had taken an interest in Peter's education, he was boarded with a farmer, Mr Fenn, at Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, with a crown pension of &pound;35 per annum. He grew up strong and muscular and was able to do manual labour under careful supervision. Each spring he would wander away from the farm. In 1751 he walked as far as Norfolk, where he was apprehended as a vagrant and committed to the Norwich city bridewell. After his release he was given a brass collar which was inscribed &#145;Peter the Wild Boy, Broadway Farm, Berkhamsted&#146;. He returned to the farm where he was visited by Monboddo in 1782, and where he died on 22 February 1785  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 236). He was buried at St Mary's, Northchurch, Hertfordshire. Research in 2011 indicated that Peter may have been affected by the genetic disorder Pitt-Hopkins syndrome.<br>
