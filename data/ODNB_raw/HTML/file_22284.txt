<span class="headword">Pilon,  Frederick</span>  (1750&#150;1788), <span class="occ">playwright and actor</span>, was born in Cork. After receiving a fairly good education in his native city, he was sent to Edinburgh University to study medicine, but he took to the stage instead. He first appeared at the Edinburgh Theatre as Oroonoko, but with small success, and consequently joined an inferior strolling company, with which he remained for some years. He finally drifted to London, where William Griffin the bookseller employed him on the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. After Griffin's death had deprived him of this position, he seems to have worked as an obscure literary hack until he began to write for the stage.<br>
<br>Pilon was soon employed with some regularity at Covent Garden Theatre. There, on 4 November 1778, <span class="italic">The Invasion, or, A Trip to Brighthelmstone</span>&#151;&#145;a moderate farce&#146;, according to John Genest&#151;was performed, with Lee Lewis in the chief part, Cameleon  (Genest, 6.352). It was repeated twenty-four times during the season, and was several times revived. <span class="italic">Illumination, or, The Glazier's Conspiracy</span>, a prelude, suggested by the illuminations on Admiral Keppel's acquittal, was acted on 12 April 1779 for Lee Lewis's benefit. Pilon wrote many plays for Covent Garden, including: <span class="italic">The Device, or, The Deaf Doctor</span>, which, when first produced on 27 September 1779, met with great opposition, but was successfully revived with alteration as <span class="italic">The Deaf Lover</span> on 2 February 1780; <span class="italic">The Siege of Gibraltar</span>, a musical farce (25 April 1780), celebrating Rodney's victory; and <span class="italic">Aerostation, or, The Templar's Stratagem</span> (29 October 1784), which dealt with the rage of the day for balloons. Meanwhile Pilon moved on to Drury Lane, where he on 18 May 1782 produced <span class="italic">The Fair American</span>, a comic opera, which was not very skilfully plagiarized from Samuel Tuke's <span class="italic">Adventures of Five Hours</span> (1663). Pilon's last piece, a comedy, <span class="italic">He would be a Soldier</span>, after being rejected by George Colman, was performed at Covent Garden on 18 November 1786, and achieved considerable success. In addition to his plays, all of which he published, Pilon issued &#145;The Drama&#146;, an anonymous poem, in 1775, and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Character of Hamlet as Performed by Mr Henderson</span> (1771). An edition of George Alexander Stevens's <span class="italic">Lecture on Heads</span> appeared in 1785, with additions by Pilon.<br>
<br>In 1787 Pilon married a Miss Drury of Kingston, Surrey; he died at Lambeth on 17 January 1788. At least one critic, William Gifford, lamented Pilon's brand of drama, ranking him among the &#145;blockheads of the kingdom&#146; by whom the lower orders are &#145;so brutified and besotted &hellip; that they have lost all relish for simplicity and genuine humour&#146;  (Gifford, xiii&#150;xiv).<br>
