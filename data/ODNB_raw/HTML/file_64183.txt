<span class="headword">Coghlan,  James Peter</span>  (1731?&#150;1800), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic printer and publisher</span>, probably born on 22 October 1731 in Preston, Lancashire, was the son of James Coghlan (<i>d</i>. 1776), stonecutter, and Elizabeth Coghlan (<i>d</i>. 1760). In 1754, after an apprenticeship with Samuel Cope, bookbinder of the parish of St James, Westminster, Coghlan established his own business as a bookbinder and stationer. Coghlan's own &#145;Memorandum book&#146;, in which he noted down detailed technical information about the material and the tools purchased when he started his business, gives a unique insight into the practical background of the bookbinding trade in the 1750s. At least two of Coghlan's early bindings have been preserved and they are admired for their outstanding quality: Charles Barbandt's <span class="italic">Sacred Hymns, Anthems etc.</span> (1766) and Thomas Meighan's <span class="italic">The Office of the Holy Week</span> (1766).<br>
<br>On 6 February 1760 Coghlan married Elizabeth Brown (1728&#150;1799) of Clifton-cum-Salwick, near Preston. There were six children of this marriage, four of whom, Peter, Elizabeth, Ann, and William, entered the religious life, William becoming a secular priest. Coghlan soon added printing to his business. Certainly as early as 1764 he brought out his own edition of the <span class="italic">Laity's Directory</span> as a rival publication to the one published by James Marmaduke. This <span class="italic">Directory</span>, published on Marmaduke's own authority from 1758 onwards, was a simple religious calendar to which were added some small features such as lives of saints and martyrs. Coghlan's rival edition, published &#145;by permission and with approbation&#146; of the Roman Catholic episcopate, easily eclipsed Marmaduke's edition. Growing steadily from thirty pages to more than ninety by the end of the century, Coghlan's <span class="italic">Directory</span> came to contain all the elements of a Catholic newsletter: pastoral letters, instructions for the observation of Lent and other directives, obituaries, and advertisements for Catholic educational institutes, besides Coghlan's own book catalogues.<br>
<br>After Coghlan had taken over the stock of Thomas Meighan's declining firm in 1774, he was the most important printer, publisher, and bookseller for the English Catholic community. In the 1780s Coghlan published a large number of documents relating to the Catholic struggle for emancipation that were issued by the Catholic Committee. He played an important part as an intermediary in the Catholic community of his time. He had contacts with a great many prominent Catholics, notably George Hay, who was the leading prelate of the Catholic church in Scotland. For many years he took care of young students who went by ship from London to the continent to be trained at one of the Catholic colleges abroad. From 1790 onwards Coghlan was closely involved in the relief operations for the benefit of English Catholic religious orders when the revolution forced them to abandon their monasteries and houses in northern France and Belgium. Coghlan used his influence with members of parliament and customs officials to obtain passports, collect funds, and find accommodation for the refugees.<br>
<br>Coghlan's correspondence gives a very good picture of the life of English Catholics during the final quarter of the eighteenth century. Coghlan was a devout and deeply religious person and a confirmed Catholic. He died at 37 Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 20 February 1800, and the <span class="italic">Laity's Directory</span> for the year 1801 had the following obituary: &#145;Mr. J. P. Coghlan &hellip; upwards of 40 years Catholic Printer and bookseller, No 37 Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, age 68&#146;. His last will and testament, signed 18 February 1800, was proved 15 March 1800 by the oath of his son William. Coghlan's business was taken over by his nephew Richard Brown, who, soon acting under the name of Keating, Brown, and Keating, continued to use Coghlan's name in the imprints of his publications for some time.<br>
