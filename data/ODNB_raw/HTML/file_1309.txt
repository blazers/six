<span class="headword">Bannatyne,  George</span>  (1545&#150;1607/8), <span class="occ">compiler of the Bannatyne manuscript</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 22 December 1545, the seventh child and fourth (but second surviving) son of James Bannatyne of Kirktown of Newtyle (1512&#150;1584) and Catherine Telfer (1522/3&#150;1570). George had eleven brothers and eleven sisters. No offspring is known from his father's second marriage in 1573 to Jonet Cockburn, widow of James Wood, portioner of Bonnington (<i>d</i>. 1546) and, secondly, of David Forrester, merchant burgess of Edinburgh (<i>d</i>. 1572). In 1558 a George Ballenden matriculated at St Mary's College, St Andrews, where he also appears among the <i>baccalaurei</i> and <i>intrantes</i> of 1560&#150;62, this time with the name spelt Ballandyne. This is most likely to be George Bellenden, half-brother of Sir John Bellenden, justice-clerk, who was studying in Paris in 1564. However, since scribes regularly mistook the name Bannatyne for Ballenden, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out that this is in fact George Bannatyne; several of his brothers studied in St Andrews, their names likewise misspelt. Although Bannatyne was never styled <i>maister</i> in later life, he may have obtained his master's licence but not have been able to go through the required formal ceremonies because of the troubles of the Reformation, with his later career in business never requiring him to rectify this. However, it is more likely that he did not go to university altogether.<br>
<br>George's father, burgess of Edinburgh, was writer to the signet, keeper of the rolls, member of Edinburgh town council, searcher of English ships, and deputy justice-clerk. He was closely related to the poet John Bellenden and to Sir John and Sir Lewis Bellenden, consecutive justice-clerks. George Bannatyne was thus connected to the contemporary literary, legal, and political establishment, which is confirmed by the &#145;Memoriall buik&#146; in which he faithfully copied the births, marriages, and deaths of loved ones.<br>
<br>These urban and legal circles with connections to church, court, and literature enabled Bannatyne to compile the Bannatyne manuscript, the most wide-ranging of the contemporary Scottish literary miscellanies, arranging some four hundred texts, many otherwise unknown, into five sections of religious, moral, merry, amatory, and narrative poetry, for an audience that wanted such texts for a range of didactic and leisure-time purposes. Opinions are divided as to whether he copied the manuscript at his family's estate of Newtyle in Angus (Forfarshire) or at their Edinburgh residence in the Cowgate; whether he did so in the last three months of 1568 or from 1565 to 1568; whether it was meant to be printed; and whether it was intended as a conceptually focused family miscellany, or even a coterie anthology.<br>
<br>The lack of evidence for any other cultural enterprise by Bannatyne suggests that ethical and utilitarian rather than aesthetic or nationalist impulses lie behind his compilation. Merging an appreciation of vernacular texts with socially conservative yet culturally open-minded tastes, his editing presents literature as both moral counsel and entertainment in a laicized society that, based on law and education, emphasizes civic responsibility. Such &#145;vernacular humanism&#146; fits with Bannatyne's public profile as a reformer concerned with the <i>bonum commune</i> rather than with doctrinal issues; as a result, his protestant self-censorship was not rigorous and some Roman Catholic features of his copy-texts remained. In their attempt to combine the archaic dictates of courtly love with a more rational philosophy of love, the two eloquently conventional poems attributed to Bannatyne in the manuscript reflect a similar mindset.<br>
<br>In 1572 James Bannatyne gifted his son a tenement in Leith near Edinburgh, adjacent to property owned by William Fowler, elder brother of the poet of the same name and uncle to another poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden. George Bannatyne was also presented in 1582 with the income deriving from the chaplaincy of St Michael's altar in the parish church of Crieff, vacant by decease of John Bannatyne, his uncle. On 27 October 1587 he was made merchant and guild brother of Edinburgh; he was styled &#145;merchant&#146; throughout his life, but his wealth derived mainly from numerous financial transactions, especially speculation with annual rents. At an uncertain date he married Isobel Mauchan (1545/6&#150;1603), widow of the bailie William Nisbet and mother of Edward and Isobel Nisbet. They had three children, Jonet (1587&#150;1631), James (1589&#150;1598), and a stillborn daughter (1593). Jonet in 1603 became the second wife of George Foulis (1569&#150;1633), second son of James Foulis of Colinton and master of the king's mint. Through this marriage the Bannatyne manuscript passed into the Foulis family; it is now in the National Library of Scotland. The best diplomatic version is that edited by W. Tod Ritchie, <span class="italic">The Bannatyne Manuscript</span> (Scottish Text Society, 1928&#150;1934), which contains many transcripts of family documents. An excellent facsimile edition is provided by Denton Fox and William A. Ringler, in <span class="italic">The Bannatyne Manuscript</span> (1980).<br>
<br>In 1600 Bannatyne was appointed master of Trinity Hospital, just outside Edinburgh, for a year, an appointment which indicates that Bannatyne linked business acumen with charity. In 1606 he lived with his daughter's family in Dreghorn, a few miles south-west of Edinburgh. He was still alive on 10 September 1607 but had died by 5 April 1608, a document of that date stating that the deceased George Bannatyne had been searcher of customable skins, an office that had been held by several members of his family before him. His wife's testament&#151;his own has not been preserved&#151;suggests the couple enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle.<br>
