<span class="headword">Philipot,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22108/', "John Philipot (c.1589&#150;1645)")</script>, Somerset herald, and Susan (<i>d</i>. 1665), only daughter and heir of William Glover of Sandwich, Kent. He was admitted a fellow-commoner of Clare College, Cambridge, on 10 February 1634 and matriculated on 29 March 1634. He graduated MA <i>per</i> lit. reg. on 4 February 1636 and was incorporated in that degree at Oxford in July 1640. At some point he settled near Greenwich, where he lived quietly and prosperously until his death. According to Anthony Wood, &#145;he was by those that well knew him, esteemed a tolerable poet when young, and at riper years well vers'd in matters of div[inity] history and antiquities&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.518). He dedicated his <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1646) to &#145;the publike Assertor of Letters&#146;  (sig. A2) Mildmay Fane, the second earl of Westmorland. In one copy the date has been changed in manuscript to 3 February 1645. A poem by Philipot, &#145;Faire Chloris standinge by the fier&#146;, absent from the 1646 collection, appears in the commonplace book of Sir John Perceval, compiled at Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1646&#150;9 (Egmont MS). In 1659 he published as his own work his father's <span class="italic">Villare Cantianum, or, Kent Surveyed and Illustrated</span>. He may have used the time and industry expended editing his father's papers to justify this deception to himself. A British Library copy (shelfmark 578.i.21) has manuscript additions by Philipot. Two years later there appeared his <span class="italic">An historical discourse of the first invention of navigation and the additional improvements of it</span>, dedicated to Sir Francis Prujean. Philipot went on to publish several more treatises, including <span class="italic">Self-homicide-murther, or, Some antidotes and arguments gleaned out of the treasuries of our modern casuists and divines against that horrid and reigning sin of self-murther</span> (1674). He justified this treatise by pointing to the evil influence of John Donne's <span class="italic">Biathanatos</span>  (sig. A2). Philipot had many literary friends and contributed verses to Payne Fisher's <span class="italic">Marston Moor</span> (1650), William Cartwright's <span class="italic">Comedies</span> (1651), Edmund Benlowes's <span class="italic">Theophila</span> (1652), John Boys's <span class="italic">Aeneas his Descent into Hell</span> (1661), and Thomas Southouse's <span class="italic">Monasticon Favershamiense</span> (1671). Philipot was buried at Greenwich on 30 September 1682. His will, dated 11 September 1680, leaves certain premises to Clare College, Cambridge, for the creation of two Kentish fellowships, and his houses in the town of Eltham and a field to the Clothworkers' Company to establish six almshouses for four people from Eltham and two from Chiselhurst, allowing them &pound;5 each a year.<br>
