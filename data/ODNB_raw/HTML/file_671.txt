<span class="headword">Arnall,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Francis Walsingham]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1736), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, is of unknown parentage and upbringing. He trained as a lawyer before, in 1728, he took up writing for the government at Sir Robert Walpole's personal request, having &#145;vouchsafed&#146; the prime minister's protection before &#145;[his] twentieth year&#146;  (Downie, 179). For the next eight years Arnall worked as a government employee in the production of newspapers and pamphlets during an intense period of political journalism which saw pro-Walpolean publications pitted against the <span class="italic">Craftsman</span> of the opposition or &#145;country&#146; whigs. After a brief time at the <span class="italic">British Journal</span> or <span class="italic">Censor</span> (1728), where he appeared as &#145;Roger Manly of Lincoln's Inn&#146;, Arnall wrote extensively for the <span class="italic">Daily Gazeteer</span> and the <span class="italic">Free Briton</span> under the pseudonym Francis Walsingham. The government invested considerable sums of public money for a school of journalists, in which Arnall, together with James Pitt and Ralph Courteville, became a leading player. Figures from the committee of inquiry into Walpole's expenditure indicate that the prime minister provided over &pound;50,000 for his writing circle between 1731 and 1734, with over &pound;10,997 allocated to Arnall for distribution to other journalists or to meet printing costs. Arnall himself received an annual pension of about &pound;400, making him the best paid government journalist in London.<br>
<br>In return Arnall provided a series of papers which challenged country whig allegations of a supposedly corrupt, immoral, and tyrannous ministry. By contrast Arnall exposed the anachronism of a country party unaware of the benefits of modern levels of commercial enterprise dependent on private expressions of self-interest. It was, Arnall believed, the government's obligation (and present achievement) to stimulate this passion to ensure the self-preservation of the greatest number of the populace. This new responsibility demanded an end to the traditional equation of politics and morality and, indeed, as Arnall suggested in one of his more controversial pieces (<span class="italic">Free Briton</span>, 28 June 1732), the promotion of corruption by ministers to channel individual self-interest towards nationally productive ends. Though well rewarded and respected, the provocative nature of Arnall's essays meant that he was closely monitored by Walpole throughout his career. &#145;On extraordinary occasions&#146;, wrote the earl of Egmont, the prime minister even dictated Arnall's column for the <span class="italic">British Journal</span>  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.324). At other times, such as during the bank contract controversy (1735), Walpole scrutinized Arnall's work before publication, aware of the journalist's talent for intemperate comments in defence of the ministry.<br>
<br>Arnall's outspoken style and his close relationship with Walpole inevitably made him a popular target for the opposition <span class="italic">Craftsman</span> and <span class="italic">Fog's Journal</span>, as well as in verse satires such as Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> (1735, bk 2.315), where he was:<blockquote>
<div>No crab more active in the dirty dance,<br>
</div>
<div>Downward to climb or backward to advance<br>
</div>
</blockquote>or <span class="italic">Verres and his Scribblers</span>, where the &#145;trifler&#146; Arnall was said to &#145;chatter, / A flow of words, froth misinformed with matter&#146;  (Hanson, 113). In addition to his work for the Walpole press Arnall also published a number of pamphlets on political and ecclesiastical themes, including <span class="italic">Clodius and Cicero</span> (1727), <span class="italic">A Letter to the Revd Dr Codex</span> [Edmund Gibson] (1733), <span class="italic">Opposition No Proof of Patriotism</span> (1735), <span class="italic">The Complaint of the Children of Israel</span> (1736, under the name Solomon Abrabanel), and <span class="italic">Animadversions on Bishop Sherlock's Remarks on the Tythe Bill</span>, reprinted in <span class="italic">The Pillars of Priestcraft and Orthodoxy Shaken</span> (2nd edn, 1768). Arnall's death in May 1736 was reported in the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> for 3 June.<br>
