<span class="headword">Bird,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1609), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and private tutor</span>, matriculated as a sizar from Trinity College, Cambridge, in February 1565, and was elected a scholar in the same year. He graduated BA early in 1569, became a fellow in 1570, and proceeded MA in 1572.<br>
<br>Bird appears later to have served as curate in or around Saffron Walden, Essex. Here, in 1576, he encountered a group of dissenters who suggested that the moral law embodied in the commandments was no longer binding. Bird sought and received the advice of John Whitgift, then the master of his college, as to the best way of replying. Despite his marriage in the same year to Elizabeth, of whom no more details are known, he maintained his connection with Trinity, proceeding BD in 1580 and serving the college as junior bursar in 1579&#150;80 and junior dean in 1581&#150;2. Also in 1582 he acquired the rectory of Woodchurch, Kent.<br>
<br>Subsequently Bird was appointed tutor to William Cecil, eldest son of Sir Thomas Cecil, heir of the lord treasurer, Lord Burghley. On 3 November 1585, while travelling with Bird in France, the young man was reported to be attending exercises with the Jesuits, and he embraced the Roman Catholic faith soon afterwards. The conversion of the future head of a leading family was a source of grave concern, and Bird was blamed, at least by Sir Edward Stafford, the English ambassador in Paris. In January 1586 Bird wrote to Burghley that Stafford had publicly denounced him as a traitor, threatened him with a whipping, and subjected him to other indignities. Bird protested that he had endeavoured to fulfil his duties as tutor conscientiously, but had been &#145;robbed of the sowle of that young gentleman by wicked and treacherous men&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 46, fol. 18).<br>
<br>The episode was not fatal to Bird's prospects. On 21 March 1589 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Cleveland, in the diocese of York, and on 29 September 1590, on the presentation of William Woodhall of Walden, Essex, he was instituted as canon of the tenth prebend of Canterbury Cathedral. He resigned his archdeaconry on 19 April 1601. By December 1597 Bird was also vicar of Brooklands in Kent, and he held the living until his death. He was created DD in 1608. Bird died in June 1609 and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral on 19 June.<br>
