<span class="headword">Strang,  John</span>  (1795&#150;1863), <span class="occ">author and statistician</span>, was born on 10 February 1795 in Charlotte Street, Dowanhill, just beyond the then western boundary of Glasgow, the son of John Strang (<i>d</i>. 1809/10), a wine merchant in the city. His mother's maiden name was McGilp, but nothing else is known about her. He received a liberal education at Dr Boyd's school and at Glasgow grammar school, and became proficient in both French and German; he learned Italian later in life. His father died when he was fourteen, and he subsequently inherited the business of John Strang &amp; Co. and lived above the shop in Stockwell Street. Strang appears to have had little enthusiasm for the wine trade and gave up the shop before he moved to live in Woodside Place, probably in 1834. As a man of independent means, he was able to devote his energies to literature and the arts. In December 1842 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Anderson, a distinguished Glasgow physician. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1817 Strang visited France and Germany, and he retained a love for foreign travel throughout his life. He began to translate stories and poems from the French and the German for British periodicals, and published a life of Theodore Karl Koerner and (under the pseudonym Richard Holcruff) a book of translations of the works of other German writers. In 1831 he returned to the continent and wrote <span class="italic">Germany in 1831</span> (1836), a well-received two-volume work in which he set out to investigate the Teutonic character. He became a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Scots Times</span> (1826&#150;31) and a literary critic for <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (1832&#150;3). In 1832 he became the editor of <span class="italic">The Day</span>, a short-lived daily literary paper published in Glasgow, to which he contributed articles and poems.<br>
<br>Strang was an accomplished artist, and took a keen interest in local architecture. It is said that it was while sketching features of Glasgow that he became interested in the creation of an imposing &#145;garden cemetery&#146; to adorn the city. In 1831 he wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Necropolis Glasguensis</span>, advocating the scheme and publicized his idea in letters to newspapers and through his social contacts. The Merchants House undertook the task of laying out the necropolis, modelled on the graveyard of P&egrave;re Lachaise in Paris, in the Fir Park (which it owned) near Glasgow Cathedral. It opened in 1833 and it has remained one of the city's best-known landmarks.<br>
<br>After the demise of <span class="italic">The Day</span> Strang embarked on a career in civic affairs. In 1834 he was appointed Glasgow's city chamberlain, and served in that office for twenty-nine years. He won great respect for his sound management of the municipal finances, and was praised as a writer on social and economic affairs. His annual reports on the social and economic statistics of Glasgow, and a series of articles on statistics relating to the city's industries, public health, and living conditions published in <span class="italic">The Journal of the Statistical Society of London</span> were considered to be highly advanced for the day. Many of the articles were subsequently published in <span class="italic">The Economic and Social Statistics of Glasgow and the West of Scotland</span> (1851&#150;61).<br>
<br>Strang's most popular book was <span class="italic">Glasgow and its Clubs</span> (1855), an entertaining history of the city, its people, and social life, which appeared in two subsequent editions (1857 and 1864) and has been mined for anecdote and fact by generations of journalists and historians of the city. In 1843 the University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD, in recognition of his public service and of his literary work. On his retirement as city chamberlain in 1863 the citizens of Glasgow presented him with a cheque for &pound;4600 as a token of their gratitude for his services.<br>
<br>Strang died on 8 December 1863 at Woodside Place, Glasgow. He was buried in the necropolis which was inspired by his vision on 14 December. He was survived by his wife. He was one of Glasgow's greatest public servants, and his painstaking work in compiling social and economic statistics for the city provided valuable data for social reformers and advocates of municipal improvement schemes. He was also one of Glasgow's leading men of letters, with <span class="italic">Glasgow and its Clubs</span> as his most popular and enduring work.<br>
