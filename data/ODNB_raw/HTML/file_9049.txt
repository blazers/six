<span class="headword">Fabell,  Peter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>15th cent.), <span class="occ">supposed magician</span>, was popularly known in the folklore of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as the Merry Devil of Edmonton. The earliest known sign of Fabell's legend was a poem in <i>ottava rima</i> called <span class="italic">Fabyl's Ghoste</span>, printed by John Rastell in 1533. Thomas Warton described this poem in 1781, dismissing it as &#145;of no merit&#146;, but it is no longer extant  (Warton, 3.81). John Norden briefly notes in his <span class="italic">Speculum Britanniae</span> (1593) that Fabell is buried in Edmonton's church, and &#145;is said to have beguiled the Devell by pollicie for money, But the Devell is deceit it selfe, and hardly deceived&#146;  (Norden, 18).<br>
<br>Several literary works of the early seventeenth century expand on Norden's description. An anonymous comedy featuring Fabell, <span class="italic">The Merry Devil of Edmonton</span>, was written before 1604 for the King's Men and became one of the most popular plays of the century. The prologue calls Fabell a &#145;renowned Scholler&#146; who had studied at Cambridge, and claims that<blockquote>
<div>In Edmonton yet fresh unto this day,<br>
</div>
<div>Fixt in the wall of that old antient Church,<br>
</div>
<div>His monument remayneth to be seene.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Merry Devil</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>)</blockquote>The play opens with Fabell tricking a demon to whom he has sold his soul, but for the rest of the play he takes a back seat to various comic characters and mismatched lovers. The play was first printed in 1608, with five more editions in the next fifty years.<br>
<br>To capitalize on the play's success, a prose pamphlet called <span class="italic">The Life and Death of the Merry Devil of Edmonton</span>, by T. B., was written in 1608 and probably printed that year, though the earliest surviving edition dates from 1631. The author states that Peter Fabell was &#145;a man of good discent&#146; and &#145;great learning&#146; who was &#145;very pleasant, kinde, &amp; free-hearted&#146;, and who was born, lived, and died in Edmonton in the reign of Henry VII  (Abrams, 226&#150;7). John Weever cites this pamphlet sceptically in his <span class="italic">Ancient Funerall Monuments</span> (1631), adding that Fabell &#145;lieth interred under a seemelie Tombe without Inscription&#146; in Edmonton church  (Weever, 534). Thomas Fuller also mentions Fabell sceptically in his <span class="italic">Worthies</span> (1662), writing that &#145;some make him a friar, others a lay gentleman, all a conceited person, who with his many devises deceived the devil&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.327). Fuller puts Fabell in the reign of Henry VI, rather than Henry VII.<br>
<br>Despite the scepticism of these early accounts, Fabell probably was a real person, though his tricking of the devil is obviously fictional. He may be the &#145;Favell&#146; who received a BA at Cambridge in 1469&#150;70, given the claims about his education and dates  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>, 2.125). He is less likely to be the Peter Fabell who made his will in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, in 1526, given the distance from Edmonton  (Phillimore and Duncan, 205). Alternatively, Bolton suggests that the magician was Peter Favelore, who built a chapel within the Edmonton church before his death in 1360, and who left lands in Edmonton, Enfield, Tottenham, and Kent  (Bolton, 131). This man lived a century before the dates given by Fuller and T. B., but would have been entitled to a monument in the church.<br>
