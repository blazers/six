<span class="headword">Luke, Sir  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1603, <em>d.</em> 1670), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was baptized at Southill, Bedfordshire, on 27 March 1603, the eldest son of Sir Oliver Luke (<i>b</i>. 1574, <i>d</i>. in or after 1650) of Woodend in Cople, Bedfordshire, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1607), daughter of Sir Valentine Knightley of Fawsley, Northamptonshire. Samuel was born into one of the great political networks of the early seventeenth century, which encompassed not only his mother's immediate family but also the Fleetwoods, Lyttons, and Barringtons.<br>
<br>Luke attended Eton College between 1617 and 1619. He and a younger brother travelled in Europe in 1623. On 2 February 1624 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Freeman, a London merchant and member of the Haberdashers' Company. Together they had six sons and four daughters. Luke was knighted later that year, on 20 July. His name appears in 1625 listed in the burgess rolls of Bedford, which lay 3 miles from the family seat; by 1636 he was a member of the Bedfordshire commission of sewers and by 1640 a JP for the borough of Bedford.<br>
<br>In both the Short Parliament of April 1640 and the Long Parliament Luke was elected for Bedford, evidently on an anti-court ticket, while his father was one of the members for the county. Sir Samuel's election to both parliaments was a matter of dispute: four days before the Short Parliament ended he still had not been allowed to sit, and he did not begin his work in the Long Parliament until August 1641. When war broke out in England both father and son took the side of parliament. In July 1642 Samuel was wounded in endeavouring to arrest Sir Lewis Dyve. He was present at the battle of Edgehill as captain of a troop of horse, and on 4 January 1643 was commissioned by the earl of Essex to raise a regiment of dragoons in Bedfordshire. His newly raised regiment was surprised by Prince Rupert at Chinnor, Oxfordshire, on 18 June 1643; 50 were killed and 120 taken prisoner. Luke himself was absent, but fought by John Hampden's side in the defeat at Chalgrove Field, Oxfordshire, on the same day, where he greatly distinguished himself by his courage. &#145;Great-spirited little Sir Samuel Luke&#146;, says a parliamentarian paper, &#145;so guarded himself with his short sword, that he escaped without hurt, though thrice taken prisoner, yet rescued, and those to whom he was prisoner slain&#146;  (J. Forster, <span class="italic">John Pym, 1584&#150;1643&#151;John Hampden, 1594&#150;1643</span>, 1837, 371). On 5 July 1643 and again on 28 September Luke was thanked by parliament for his services. He became scoutmaster-general of Essex's army, assisted in the recovery of Newport Pagnell, Bedfordshire, on 29 October 1643, and became its governor when it was made a permanent garrison.<br>
<br>Luke co-operated with Oliver Cromwell in the capture of Hillesdon House, Buckinghamshire, of which he sent a detailed account to the speaker. On 26 May 1644 Luke surprised Fortescue's regiment of royalist horse at Islip, Oxfordshire. As both governor and scoutmaster Luke was extremely energetic and efficient. &#145;This noble commander&#146;, <span class="italic">Mercurius Britanicus</span> declared, &#145;watches the enemy so industriously that they eat, sleep, drink not, whisper not, but he can give us an account of their darkest proceedings&#146; (<span class="italic">Mercurius Britanicus</span>, 218; quoted in <span class="italic">GM</span>): a claim confirmed by the journal that he maintained of his scouts' reports, covering the period 9 February 1643 to 29 March 1644. The fall of Leicester to the royalists seemed to endanger Newport, and Luke complained that he had only 600 men at his disposal to defend works requiring 2000 men to man them. &#145;We want all provisions,&#146; he wrote, &#145;and if we escape storm we cannot hold out long&#146;  (Rushworth, 6.38). But the victory of Naseby saved Newport from attack, and on 26 June 1645 the operation of the self-denying ordinance put a term to Luke's command. On 11 January 1647 parliament ordered him to be paid &pound;4482 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for arrears of pay.<br>
<br>Luke was a strong presbyterian, and his time at Newport Pagnell was marked not only by his problems with an ill-paid and discontented garrison, but by his anxiety over the social and religious threat posed by sectaries. He suppressed conventicles and dismissed an officer &#145;for disaffection to the service and perverseness to all religious exercises&#146;  (Hill, 49). He complained that it was &#145;far easier to breed people up to wickedness than to godliness, especially when under profession of the latter they may with allowance practice the former&#146;, and edgily reported tales of sexual disorder. Unless he could rid the town of sectaries Luke feared that Newport Pagnell would go the way of Sodom and Gomorrah. He attempted to counter the threat with a roster of divines, regular sermons three times a week, and prayers and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading every morning at the changing of the guard. Matters came to a head on 15 June 1645, the day after Naseby, when Luke ordered a service of thanksgiving for the victory. Passing through the town were two New Model Army captains, the Particular Baptist preacher Paul Hobson and Richard Beaumont&#151;&#145;tailor Hobson&#146; and &#145;druggist Beaumont&#146;, as Luke, who firmly believed that officers should be gentlemen, dismissed them: &#145;Anabaptists, who cannot consent with magistracy or government&#146;  (Hill, 50). When Hobson chose to ignore the official church parade and instead himself preached openly Luke had the two men arrested for transgressing the orders of parliament against unlicensed preaching. He thus became involved in a quarrel with their commanders, Charles Fleetwood and Sir Thomas Fairfax, and continued to pursue the matter even after he had ceded the governorship, having Hobson rearrested and sent before a parliamentary committee; his efforts succeeded only in incurring the hatred of the Independent party in the army.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1647 Luke was seized by a party of soldiers on suspicion that he was raising the forces of Bedfordshire to assist the city against the army, but he was speedily released by Fairfax. On the occasion of Pride's Purge (6 December 1648) Luke was again arrested, having been readily identified as a keen supporter of the treaty of Newport, but he was set at liberty on 20 December, and no charge was brought against him. Luke took no part in public affairs during the Commonwealth and protectorate. He literally cultivated his own garden, swapping plants and cuttings with his neighbour Dorothy Osborne who described him as &#145;a nice florist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Dorothy Osborne</span>, 46). As the Restoration approached in early 1660 he received a militia command. He was returned to the Convention parliament as MP for Bedford, but was defeated in the election the following year. In his later years he was perhaps in some financial difficulty, alienating one of his main estates, at Hawnes, Bedfordshire, to Sir George Carteret. Luke died in 1670, and was buried at Cople on 30 August.<br>
<br>Luke was a very little man, and his size made him a butt for royalist satire. His reputation has suffered from the supposition that he was the original of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4204/', "Samuel Butler's")</script> Sir Hudibras. The key to <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> attributed to Sir Roger L'Estrange explained that Sir Hudibras was &#145;Sir Samuel Luke of Bedfordshire, a self-conceited commander under Oliver Cromwell&#146;  (Butler, vol. 1). However, Butler himself said that his model was a west-country knight, and a more plausible candidate is Sir Henry Rosewell of Ford Abbey, Devon. Claims that Butler had been Luke's servant seem to rest on the original misattribution. The estimate which Luke's own party formed of his character is shown by the posts with which parliament entrusted him, and by the panegyrics of parliamentarian writers such as Josiah Ricraft, to whom &#145;the valiant victorious Sir Samuel Luke&#146; was &#145;a true-hearted publike ingaged Covenant keeping and vertuous true-hearted English Knight&#146;  (J. Ricraft, <span class="italic">A Survey of Englands Champions and Truths Faithfull Patriots</span>, 1647, 78). Both Luke's journal and his letter-books have been published (as has his diary of the siege of Reading in 1643) and prove him a vigilant and energetic officer, and a man of sense and courage. His correspondence offers clues as to his personality: a mainstream puritan gentleman concerned with the maintenance of the social order, but also fond of fine clothes, good cheer, and good claret, who showed &#145;fatherly concern for the education of his son in Italy and in the Netherlands armies, and an interest in falconry which he shared with his powerful kinsman, Lord Saye and Sele&#146;  (Keeler, <span class="italic">Long Parliament</span>, 262).<br>
