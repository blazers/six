<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paul,  Herbert Woodfield</span>  (1853&#150;1935), <span class="occ">author and politician</span>, was born at Finedon, Northamptonshire, on 16 January 1853, the eldest son of George Woodfield Paul, vicar of Finedon and honorary canon of Peterborough Cathedral, and his wife, Jessie Philippa, daughter of Lieutenant Herbert Mackworth RN. From Eton College he won a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was president of the Union (1875), and obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1875). Called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1878, he never practised, though he could be imagined as a formidable cross-examiner; but he devoted himself to literary work, largely in the political field, soon becoming a skilled leader writer for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>.<br>
<br>In 1883 Paul married Elinor Budworth, daughter of William Ritchie, legal member of the viceroy's council in India, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35764/', "Sir Richmond T. W. Ritchie")</script>. She was a lady of great charm. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>From 1892 until 1895 Paul sat as member for South Edinburgh. A devoted follower of Gladstone, he was a strong party man and in particular a convinced free-trader, but although a capable debater, did not win in parliament the reputation merited by his exceptional talents.<br>
<br>Besides <span class="italic">Men and Letters</span> (1901) and a competent appreciation of Gladstone's career (<span class="italic">Life of W. E. Gladstone</span>, 1901)&#151;an expansion of his memoir in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>&#151;Paul published in 1902 <span class="italic">Matthew Arnold</span>, with whom he had many literary sympathies, as he had with a very different figure, Lord Acton, whose letters to Mary Gladstone he edited in 1904. In 1905 came a defence of Froude as a historian (<span class="italic">Life of Froude</span>). His most solid and important work was the <span class="italic">History of Modern England</span> (5 vols., 1904&#150;6), which was justly described as the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> tempered by epigrams. <span class="italic">Stray Leaves</span>, a collection of essays, was published in 1906. This book was followed by a study of the age of <span class="italic">Queen Anne</span> (a period in which he felt completely at home) for Goupil's illustrated monographs (1906; revised without illustrations, 1912), and by <span class="italic">Famous Speeches</span> (1910).<br>
<br>Meanwhile the Liberal triumph of 1906 had returned Paul for Northampton; but in 1907 a nervous collapse foreshadowed his retirement in 1909. By 1910 he had sufficiently recovered to undertake the office of second civil service commissioner (to which he had been appointed the previous year), and for which he was perfectly suited by his gifts and attainments, and which he held until 1918. The rest of his life was spent in retirement at Cherry Orchard, Forest Row, Sussex, where he died on 4 August 1935; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Paul never sought or obtained popularity in the conventional sense; his comments, often sharp, but never captious or unfair, aroused the animosity of one or two fellow writers; but he was less contemptuous than he appeared to be, and recognized all work which was not slipshod or marred by prejudice. He ignored gossip and scandal, and despised those who found pleasure in discussing the weaknesses of men whom he deemed to be essentially great. He was no lettered recluse, but a pleasant companion in leisure hours. Nurtured in a county for which fox-hunting was a religious exercise, he could appreciate the points of a well-bred horse; and he thoroughly enjoyed good cheer and a glass of choice wine. He had some enemies, but was the most loyal of friends, and it is sad that he left a slighter mark on his age than some who could not claim a tithe of his ability or his acquirements.<br>
