<span class="headword">Longley family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1860&#150;1994), <span class="occ">builders and contractors</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_50191"></a><span class="headword">James Longley</span>  (1836&#150;1915), who was born on 6 June 1836 and baptized at Lindfield, Sussex, the eldest son of fourteen children of James Longley (1810&#150;1874), a timber merchant of Turners Hill, Sussex, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beard, of Lindfield. His Sussex ancestry stretched back many generations. He was educated privately. On 13 September 1858 he married Louisa (1833&#150;1902), the daughter of Thomas Fuller of Newington, London, and Turners Hill. They had seven sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>James Longley was originally apprenticed as a carpenter to a Mr Anscombe, a builder in Lindfield. At the age of twenty-five he entered into partnership as a builder with his father-in-law, whom he bought out quite soon. In 1882 James moved to Crawley, where he established a steam joinery works, and in 1888 he took his own sons <a href="#cosubject_50189">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a> and George into partnership. The business flourished as a result of the late railway boom, the development of Brighton, and church building. A peak of activity came at the turn of the century with contracts for the West Sussex Asylum, Chichester (1895), Christ's Hospital, Horsham (1896), and the King Edward VII Sanatorium, Midhurst (1903). About 1890 the firm invented and patented an interlocking wood-block flooring which was later used throughout the country. In 1897 James and Charles established the Crawley and District Water Company to provide the first public supply in the area.<br>
<br>During this pre-First World War period the partnership carried out many works in Brighton, especially on the seafront, including swimming baths, a refuse destructor, groynes, sewers, schools, churches, roads, and bridges. The London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company commissioned dozens of stations including the whole of the Cuckoo line, Newhaven harbour (twice as a result of fire), East Croydon, Lewes, and Eastbourne. Church work, not necessarily complete churches, ranged from Bideford and Beaulieu to Harrow chapel and Eastbourne. A man of great energy, enthusiasm and ambition, James served on the local board of guardians and rural district council. He died on 23 June 1915, at his home, The Beeches, Crawley, Sussex, and was buried at St John's Church, Crawley.<br>
<br>A key role in the firm was played by James Longley's second child. <a name="cosubject_50189"></a><span class="headword">Charles John Longley</span>  (1862&#150;1931)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 1 February 1862 at Turners Hill and educated locally. He began work in his father's building business at the age of fourteen and was taken into partnership in 1888. On 6 December of that year he married Alice Amelia (1863&#150;1897), the daughter of John Howell of Newick. They had one son and two daughters, as well as three other children who died in infancy. Following his wife's death in 1897 Charles married, on 12 April 1899, Anna Gibson (1871&#150;1938), the daughter of Henry Marchant of Eastbourne. They had two sons, <a href="#cosubject_50253">Norman</a> and <a href="#cosubject_50188">Basil [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Charles's younger brother, George Thomas Longley (1863&#150;1926), also entered the firm, but he is a shadowy figure, and appears to have played a supporting role to his father and elder brother.<br>
<br>The business was incorporated in 1924 as James Longley &amp; Co. Ltd, with Charles, George, and Charles's sons Norman and Basil as directors. The next year the company's joinery works was destroyed by fire but was soon rebuilt in spite of being underinsured. Charles inherited his father's energy and took a major part in the running of the firm but he became confined to a wheelchair by 1925 and died on 17 December 1931 at The Beeches, Crawley. He was buried at St John's, Crawley. He had served as overseer of the parish of Ifield.<br>
<br>Following their father's death the two sons of Charles Longley became joint managing directors of the firm. The elder, <a name="cosubject_50253"></a><span class="headword">Sir Norman Longley</span>  (1900&#150;1994), was born on 14 October 1900 at Rathcote, Goffs Park Road, Crawley, and was educated at Clifton College. On 6 June 1925 he married Dorothy Lilian (<i>b</i>. 1903), the daughter of George Baker of Horley. They had two sons and one daughter. The company just managed to survive the depression, in which it carried out every type of building work. During the Second World War, however, it played a major role in the war effort, concentrating on invasion defences and radar stations, followed by airfield construction and repair. The joinery works made pontoons for Bailey bridges and balsa wood life-rafts. After the war the company was fortunate to be on the site of one of the first new towns, Crawley, and it also took advantage of the development of Gatwick airport, which started in 1953. In parallel with the local activities, the company specialized in department store building, first at Plymouth, and then eight stores for Debenhams. In the 1960s extensive work was carried out at Oxford, Sussex, and Surrey universities, and, following work at Eton College, other work at public schools.<br>
<br>In 1968 the company changed its name to James Longley (Holdings) Ltd. Norman Longley was successively president locally, regionally, and nationally of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers, of which he also served as treasurer, and he was president of the International Federation of Building and Public Works Contractors from 1955 to 1957. Chairman of the Federated Employers Press, he was trustee of the industry pension scheme, a director of the industry's holiday-pay scheme, and a member of the joint contracts tribunal. His service to the industry culminated in his appointment as first chairman of the Construction Industry Training Board from 1964 to 1970. He retired as a director of the family firm in 1970.<br>
<br>In local government Norman Longley served on Crawley parish council, Horsham rural district council, and West Sussex county council, retiring as an alderman in 1960. He served on the board of Crawley College, Chichester, and on Graylingwell Hospital committee and the Industrial Disputes Tribunal. He gave forty-three years' service to the special constabulary, retiring as commandant of West Sussex. Other appointments included secretary of Crawley and District community association for twenty years, chairman of Crawley disablement advisory committee, director of Redland Holdings Ltd, member of the Wilson committee on noise, and the building regulations advisory committee. He was appointed CBE in 1954, knighted in 1966, and made a deputy lieutenant of West Sussex in 1975. He died on 24 January 1994 at The Beeches, Crawley; he was cremated and his ashes were placed on his parents' grave at St John's Church.<br>
<br>His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_50188"></a><span class="headword">Basil Longley</span>  (1904&#150;1979), was born on 19 January 1904 at Rathcote, Goffs Park Road, Crawley, and educated at Clifton College. On 3 June 1931 he married Sylvia Hannah (1908&#150;1990), the daughter of F. H. Garnett of Skipton, Yorkshire. They had two sons, Oliver, born in 1933, and Richard Paul, born in 1939, and one daughter, Gillian, born in 1936. The marriage was dissolved in 1940 and on 5 December 1942 he married Phyllis Lattey, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson (<i>b</i>. 1905). They had a daughter, Charis, born in 1944. Basil Longley qualified as a chartered surveyor, but devoted his whole life to running the company. This enabled his brother Norman to participate in industry-wide organizations and public affairs. Basil was above all a technical man and involved himself closely in estimating and surveying. He was identified with the success of the company in carrying out a series of department store and university contracts in the 1950s and 1960s. He died on 13 September 1979 at West Chiltington, Sussex, and was buried at the parish church there.<br>
<br>The Longley family thus ran one of the most important building firms in Sussex from the second half of the nineteenth century. Their business flourished during the railway boom, and they constructed many stations as well as churches. During the twentieth century they benefited from the inauguration of new towns, and in later years specialized in the construction of new department stores, as well as undertaking a number of university buildings. In the late twentieth century, under the direction of the fourth and fifth generations of the Longley family, the firm continued to undertake all types of building construction.<br>
