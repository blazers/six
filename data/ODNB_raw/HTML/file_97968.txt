<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McLaren,  Bruce Leslie</span>  (1937&#150;1970), <span class="occ">motor racing driver and constructor</span>, was born at Remuera, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, on 30 August 1937, the second of the three children of Leslie McLaren (1902&#150;1985), garage proprietor, and his wife, Ruth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Caundle (1906&#150;2004). One sister was seven years his senior, the other ten years his junior. He grew up in Remuera, and attended Meadowbank primary school between 1942 and 1948.<br>
<br>Around the age of ten and a half McLaren felt a pain in his left leg which was initially thought to be poliomyelitis. After a month in hospital he was diagnosed with Perthes disease, a childhood condition caused by inadequate blood supply at the head of the femur, and transferred to the Wilson Home for Crippled Children in Auckland, where his treatment comprised immobilization in a Bradshaw frame with weights dangling from his feet. His education proceeded through correspondence courses and he remained at the home for around two years until discharged in early 1950. As a result of the disease McLaren's left leg became one and a half inches shorter than his right. Particularly when tired or wearing racing boots he walked with a pronounced limp.<br>
<br>After leaving the Wilson Home, McLaren resumed a normal life, though he was banned from playing football or rugby. He swam, cycled, and rowed; as an adult he was an enthusiastic water skier. Aged thirteen he enrolled at Seddon Memorial Technical College where his ability in mathematics led him to consider a career in civil engineering. He went on to study engineering at Auckland University in 1956&#150;8 but left before graduating in order to pursue his racing ambitions.<br>
<br>From an early age McLaren demonstrated a keen interest in motor vehicles. His father and paternal uncles had been champion motorcyclists before the Second World War. After the war his father raced cars, officiated at speedway meetings, and became a leading figure in the Auckland Car Club. Bruce, who initially aspired to do speedway, had similar interests. As a teenager he became a proficient mechanic, rebuilding with his father an Austin Ulster which he raced around the family garden before he acquired a driving licence. Once he obtained a licence, aged fifteen, he began to enter motor races and hill climbs in the Auckland area. He won his class in his first event and other successes followed.<br>
<br>In the mid-1950s &#145;big-time motor racing&#146; reached New Zealand  (McLaren, 33). McLaren senior was closely involved, and the rising Australian driver Jack Brabham based his car at the McLaren Service Station. McLaren junior made his acquaintance and they became lifelong friends. In 1956 McLaren raced in a sports car event supporting the New Zealand grand prix, competing against Stirling Moss and other luminaries of motor sport. After a promising start he retired with engine trouble.<br>
<br>Two developments helped McLaren to decide his future. First, he had the opportunity to purchase Brabham's Cooper sports car and boost his race competitiveness. Second, New Zealand International Grand Prix Inc selected him for its &#145;Driver to Europe&#146; scheme. At the age of twenty and &#145;scared stiff&#146;, he put his university studies on hold and sailed from Sydney for the UK in March 1958 accompanied by a mechanic  (McLaren, 60). He disembarked at Aden, completing his journey by air, in order to race a borrowed formula 2 Cooper at Aintree. He finished ninth and received a fee of &pound;60, less &pound;50 to insure the car.<br>
<br>Many races and substantial success followed in Britain and on the continent. As a result, &#145;all ideas of an engineering degree flew out the window&#146;  (McLaren, 44). McLaren finished the 1958 season second to Brabham in the F2 championship and received several lucrative offers for the following year. He signed a sponsorship deal with Esso and joined Cooper, initially as its number two &#145;works&#146; driver. Notwithstanding his growing success he shared a modest flat in Surbiton and, until 1961, drove between races in a second-hand Morris Minor purchased from Betty Brabham.<br>
<br>McLaren's first formula 1 race (in an F1 car) was at Monaco in 1959, where he finished fifth (of five finishers). During his career he drove in more than 100 F1 races, achieving victories at Sebring (1959), Buenos Aires (1960), Monaco (1962) and, in a McLaren car, at Spa (1968). He achieved twenty-seven podium placings and twice finished second in the drivers' championship but never became champion or gained pole position on the starting grid. His victory at Sebring made him the youngest ever winner of an F1 grand prix. Thirty-seven of his F1 races were in McLaren cars, the last at Monaco in 1970. Between 1959 and 1967 he drove in eight Le Mans 24 hour races, winning in a Ford GT40, with his fellow New Zealander Chris Amon, in 1966.<br>
<br>Charles Cooper's refusal to allow Cooper Climax Specials to go to the Tasman races of 1963 prompted McLaren to set about realizing his long-held dream of building cars and running his own team: Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. His wife, Patricia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broad, whom he married in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1961, became one of its directors. Their marriage produced one child, Amanda, born in 1965.<br>
<br>The new company was based first at New Malden in Surrey, then Feltham and, from 1965, Colnbrook trading estate near Heathrow. The plan was to race and also to build cars for public sale, though the idea of direct sales was shelved until 1967 when Trojan Cars began producing McLarens for the consumer market. McLaren continued driving for Cooper until 1965, by which time Charles was dead and the Cooper Car Company had been sold.<br>
<br>McLaren, who first raced sports cars in the USA in the early 1960s, aspired to succeed on the lucrative North American circuits. In the late 1960s the McLaren team, with McLaren's fellow New Zealander Denny Hulme in its second car, dominated the Canadian-American (Can-Am) challenge cup series, winning substantial prize money as well as the Ferodo trophy (1968) and other awards. McLaren became wealthy and moved into a large house at Burwood Park, near the old Brooklands race circuit in Surrey. At the end of 1968 <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine estimated that he and his company were worth more than $1m  (Ludvigsen, 161).<br>
<br>McLaren died in an accident at Goodwood, Sussex, on 2 June 1970 while testing a McLaren M8-D. In the Lavant Straight, at a speed of up to 180 m.p.h., a section of the car's tail worked loose, causing &#145;immediate and total instability &hellip; beyond human control&#146;  (Young, 17). The car hit a concrete marshal's post and exploded. Fire and wreckage were strewn over a large area. An inquest, which returned a verdict of accidental death, deemed that McLaren died instantly of multiple injuries and burns  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 July 1970). A memorial service was held at St Paul's Cathedral on 24 June. Posthumously, the RAC awarded McLaren the 1969 Segrave trophy for winning every race of the Can-Am series in cars of his own design and construction.<br>
<br>McLaren was slim, brown-haired, and somewhat below medium height. A relaxed, modest, thoughtful, and popular star of the world's motor racing circuits, he readily acknowledged the help that others, especially his family, gave him on his way to the top. John Cooper once questioned whether he was among the best drivers of his era but others have rejected such criticism  (Ludvigsen, 43, 46, 72). McLaren may not have been the quickest or most brilliant driver in F1 history, but as a combined driver, designer, engineer, and businessman he was peerless. After his death his company remained highly successful.<br>
