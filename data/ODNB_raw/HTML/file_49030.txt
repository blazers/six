<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ralli,  Stephen Augustus</span>  (1829&#150;1902), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Marseilles, France, on 30 January 1829, the only son (there were two daughters) of Avgoustis (1792&#150;1878) and Sozonga Ralli (<i>d</i>. 1878). His father was a Greek merchant. Stephen was educated in Marseilles. At the age of twenty-two, in 1851, he was summoned to London to assist his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39298/', "Pantia Stephen Ralli (1793&#150;1865)")</script>, the senior partner in Ralli Brothers, the foremost Anglo-Greek merchant house in London. Pantia Ralli's own sons had died in early life, so the nephew was evidently groomed for the succession. At Parkfield House, Clapham, he married on 27 October 1855 his cousin Marrietta (1838&#150;1922), daughter of Antonio Theodore Ralli, merchant, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mavrogordato, of Trieste. They had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Before S. A. Ralli took entire control of Ralli Brothers he was responsible for a major new initiative in the firm, that of trade with the United States. A new interlinking partnership was created in 1860 based on London, Liverpool, and New York, with connections to New Orleans for the supply of raw cotton. The strategy and disposition of the new development was set in the mould of the parent house. S. A. Ralli explained that the:<blockquote>business is strictly commercial and legitimate; they [the partners] neither speculate in goods, nor on the stock exchanges, but confine themselves to the import and export trade with the U. States, and receive also consignments from Alexandria, Smyrna, and Syria. They have a good commission business besides the business for their own account. (Guildhall Library, MS 23826)</blockquote>Ralli Brothers also imported cotton from Egypt, installing the first steam-powered cotton gins in a factory there in 1860.<br>
<br>At the same time, Ralli Brothers' trade in India was being energetically pushed forward. New branches were opened in Bombay and Karachi about 1860 and connections &#145;up country&#146; (with Indian traders in the interior) built up. Imports from India were mainly jute, cotton, indigo, rice, saltpetre, gunnies (sacking), and shellac; exports were &#145;Manchester goods&#146;, metals, and, later, petroleum. Perhaps this new development was partly to compensate for severe competition in the Russian grain trade, where Jewish houses (notably Dreyfus and Fribourg) were using their co-religionists to penetrate the interior. Rallis' Persian branch at Tabriz, a pioneer venture launched in 1837 to import silk, and for some years a prospering concern, had to be closed in 1871 after pebrine (silkworm disease) ruined the Persian silk trade. This closure was followed by that of the branches at Constantinople and Trebizond which had been sustained by it.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the set-backs, S. A. Ralli drove his firm forward with single-minded commitment. According to a contemporary:<blockquote>the prestige and interest of the firm absorbed the very soul of the young Stephen Ralli, and filled it with a sort of religious cult. His devotion to work became a veritable passion. &hellip; He was austere &hellip; undisturbed by the accumulation of wealth &hellip; counting ostentation as a thing derogatory to the dignity of man.</blockquote>He &#145;entirely abstained&#146; from &#145;active politics&#146;, his only relaxation being the comfort of his home and his wife, herself a Ralli  (Gennadius). He was utterly loyal to the system of strict discipline instituted by his uncle in the firm, and more financially successful with it. The partnership capital of Ralli Brothers rose from &pound;500,000 in 1850 to &pound;1.2 million in 1878, &pound;2 million in 1880, and &pound;3 million in 1901, according to the Bank of England records, keeping the firm at the top of the premier league of merchant houses in Britain. In India Ralli Brothers &#145;occupies commercially the first place: neither English nor German firms can compare with its ascendency there&#146;, Stephen Ralli's biographer fairly observed in 1902  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Ralli devoted his whole time and entire career to expanding the business, but, as his biographer insists, &#145;he did not labour for money, that he considered as an object quite secondary to the prestige of the firm&#146;  (Gennadius). The standing of the firm was not however the ultimate aim: that was unquestionably to raise the moral status of the Greek trading community in Britain. The large numbers of Greek small traders settling in London and Manchester in the 1840s and 1850s gave rise to widespread suspicions, which went as high as the Bank of England, of their probity. Publication of <span class="italic">The Bubbles of Finance</span> in 1865 featuring Mr Velardi, a Greek trader &#145;like the lowest Houndsditch Jew&#146;  (M. R. Laing-Meason, <span class="italic">The Bubbles of Finance</span>, 1865, 158), appeared to confirm the prejudices of many in the indigenous community. Stephen Ralli's achievement was to succeed his uncle, not only as head of Ralli Brothers, but more particularly as the doyen and mentor of the Anglo-Greek trading community.<br>
<br>Stephen Ralli died at Monte Carlo on 2 April 1902. His widow died at Brighton in 1922. Two of his sons having died young, he was succeeded as the head of the firm by a nephew, Sir Lucas Ralli (1846&#150;1931). This third-generation head was born in Manchester and educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, which guaranteed his place, and that of his firm, in the English establishment.<br>
