<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Modbury, Devon, and baptized there on 8 February 1723, the son of George Baker, vicar of Modbury, and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1734), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29132/', "Stephen Weston")</script>, bishop of Exeter, and his wife, Lucy. He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow and graduated BA in 1744 and MA in 1749. He proceeded MD in 1756 and in the following year was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians. He began to practise at Stamford, Lincolnshire, but settled in London in 1761; among his patients was Sir Joshua Reynolds. He became a fellow of the Royal Society, was four times censor for the College of Physicians, was appointed Harveian orator for 1761, and was physician to George III and Queen Charlotte. In this last capacity he was in attendance on the king during the whole time of his mental illness from 1788, and he recommended a visit to Cheltenham to take the waters in the early stages of the affliction. Created a baronet in 1776, he was elected president of the College of Physicians nine times between 1785 and 1795. Baker married Jane Morris (<i>d</i>. 1813), daughter of Roger Morris; they had a son and a daughter. Widely famed for his deep medical knowledge, Baker was also well known for his graceful Latin prose and amusing epigrams. There was a tradition that Gray dedicated his &#145;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&#146; to him, but the earliest extant editions bear no dedication.<br>
<br>Baker's most important discovery related to the Devonshire colic and <i>colica Pictonum</i> of Poitou. Awareness of the colic was heightened during the great expansion of the cider industry in the eighteenth century, but the cause of it was unknown. John Huxham's earlier theory that excessive acidity caused the colic was disproved by Baker, who showed that it was a form of lead poisoning. As a Devon man, Baker was familiar with the disease, and noticed that while colic was most common in his own county it was almost unknown in Herefordshire, where cider was also produced locally. He inquired into the process of manufacture, and found that in the structure of the Devon presses and vats large pieces of lead were used, whereas in Herefordshire stone, wood, and iron formed all the apparatus. Baker carried out a series of simple but brilliant experiments which demonstrated the presence of lead in Devon cider, and showed that there was none in that of Herefordshire. His findings were published in <span class="italic">An Essay Concerning the Cause of the Endemical Colic of Devonshire</span> (1767). This provoked a great storm of protest. Many pamphlets were printed, by Francis Geach and the Revd Thomas Alcock among others, to ridicule Baker's findings and revive Huxham's earlier speculations (<span class="italic">Some observations on Dr Baker's essay on the endemical colic of Devonshire, by Francis Geach, surgeon at Plymouth and F.R.S: in which are added some remarks on the same subject by the Rev. Mr. Alcock</span>, 1767). However, by extending and repeating his experiments, Baker eventually succeeded in convincing his contemporaries, and from that time lead vessels were no longer used, after which colic ceased to be endemic in Devon. In other essays Baker traced further unsuspected ways in which lead poisoning might arise&#151;for example, from lead water-pipes, from tinned linings of iron vessels, from the glaze of earthenware, and from large doses of medicinal preparations of lead. He examined the subsequent symptoms in detail, corresponding with Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia, among others, and drew general attention to the wider implications of lead contaminants in food manufacture and water supplies.<br>
<br>Baker has been fairly characterized as &#145;a pioneer in the use of chemical analysis to solve an epidemical problem&#146;  (McConaghey, 359&#150;60). His other works include <span class="italic">De catarro et de dysenteria Londinensi epidemicis utrisque an M.DCC.LXII, libellus (1764)</span>, and the preface to the <span class="italic">Pharmacopeia Londinensis</span> of 1788; in English he wrote <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Merits of a Method of Inoculating the Smallpox</span> (1766) and <span class="italic">Medical Tracts, Read at the College of Physicians between the Years 1767 and 1785</span>, collected and republished by his son, Sir Frederick Francis Baker, in 1818. Baker retired from active practice in 1798, and died on 15 June 1809. He was buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly, where a tablet was erected to his memory.<br>
