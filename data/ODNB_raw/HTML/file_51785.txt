<span class="headword">Latham,  Jane Leeke</span>  (1867&#150;1938), <span class="occ">college head and missionary</span>, was born on 3 August 1867 at Holbrooke Hall, Derbyshire, the home of the Revd William and Mrs Leeke, her mother's parents. She was the daughter of Edward Latham (<i>d</i>. 1883) and his wife, Jane Leeke. Her father was for seventeen years housemaster of Repton School, where Jane spent the first eight years of her life until 1875, when he became vicar of Matlock Bath, Derbyshire. She was the third of ten children, one of whom later wrote: &#145;I always consider that our parents brought up the first three, and they brought up the rest&#146;  (Lloyd). Jane was educated at home until in 1880 she and an elder sister were sent to Cheltenham Ladies' College. When, on the death of her father in 1883, her mother moved to Blackheath Jane continued her education at the high school there, one of the most prestigious of the Girls' Public Day School Company schools. In 1886 she won a higher local scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge, and in 1889 took a good second in the mathematical tripos (graduating MA at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1907). From 1889 to 1897 she was mathematics mistress at Cheltenham, and thus came under the influence of Dorothea Beale as both pupil and colleague. In 1897 she was appointed lady warden of the Woodard school, St Anne's, at Abbots Bromley, responsible for the girls' spiritual and moral training, the headmistress being in charge of curriculum and discipline. She was largely instrumental in founding another Woodard school at Scarborough. In 1903 she became principal and head of the training department at St Mary's College, Paddington. Founded as an Anglican school in 1874, under the care of the Wantage Sisters, it had also undertaken the training of secondary schoolmistresses. Inadequate finances caused the sisters to offer it to the Woodard trustees, who were unable to accept it as the college had a conscience clause. The warden of the Woodard schools, however, was able to form a committee which secured a scheme from the charity commissioners, and Miss Latham was offered the principalship.<br>
<br>The college now endowed, but still badly housed and precarious in finance, Miss Latham did &#145;much to raise the standard of work and to place the College on a sound financial basis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Girton Review</span>). It was inspected by the Board of Education and recognized as a training college for secondary teachers who could qualify for entry on the teachers' register, authorized by the <span class="roman">Board of Education Act</span>, 1899. In 1904 St Mary's was recognized as qualifying students to be registered as internal students of the University of London's department of pedagogy. Those who were qualified by degree or equivalent took the London University diploma, the rest the Cambridge teachers' certificate; Miss Latham superintended both college and school, lectured to the students, and conducted &#145;some criticism work&#146;. She did not however approve of public criticism lessons, which were &#145;not profitable enough to repay the strain caused to the student&#146;  (Board of Education, <span class="italic">The Training of Women Teachers</span>). There is strong testimony to the quality of Miss Latham as a teacher, and her achievement was keeping this precarious structure functioning at a time when women were in the forefront of the movement for the professional training of secondary teachers. Her methods of administration were unorthodox, handing a sheaf of letters to her secretary, it is said, with the instruction, &#145;Write nice answers, will you?&#146;  (Lloyd).<br>
<br>Miss Latham was born into the world of Victorian educational reform and until this time had been actively involved within it throughout her life&#151;the reform of a boys' public school, two of the most influential new girls' schools (boarding and day, one Anglican, one non-sectarian), the oldest women's university college, the Woodard experiment in an Anglican &#145;mission to the middle classes&#146;, and the creation of a trained teaching profession. She regarded education as a vocation which gave her great spiritual satisfaction, but she had, from her childhood, been attracted to work in the mission field, and in 1908 she resigned from St Mary's. She was asked to pay a six months' visit to India to prepare a report on women's education for the Edinburgh conference of 1910. Her gradual call to the mission field was reaching its consummation. In 1910 she was appointed head of the women's work of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel mission at Ahmednagar in the Bombay diocese (from 1929 the diocese of Nasik). A second life of dedication had begun.<br>
<br>For the next twenty years Miss Latham was in charge of all women's work, with more than twelve women missionaries under her. She lived from 1910 to 1915 at Miri and from there her influence spread in the villages around. She never became fluent in the native languages, but &#145;she had a marvellous gift for getting in touch with people&#146; and &#145;immense patience and willingness to listen&#146;  (Lloyd). In 1915 she went to live at St Monica's House at Ahmednagar, giving her main attention to education. The normal school was already recognized by government as a training college for teachers, and Miss Latham's gift for organization provided it with buildings and developed its work. For a short time in 1918, with her bishop's permission, she went to work among the English soldiers in Bangalore, and for this and for her work in the famine in Ahmednagar she received in 1919 the kaisar-i-Hind medal of the second class.<br>
<br>During these busy years Miss Latham's desire for greater simplicity of life grew, and in 1931 she resigned the headship of St Monica's and went to Malegaon in the Nasik district, where there was a derelict Church Missionary Society mission station which the bishop hoped to revitalize. With two Christian schoolmistresses she opened a small school for girls; she also began a medical relief association, and with the support of the Red Cross opened village dispensaries. While the bishop recognized that Miss Latham had brought Malegaon to life he considered the strain on her at the age of sixty-eight was too great, and before she went on furlough in 1935 he told her that on her return she must be content to lead a quiet life of prayer.<br>
<br>Before her return Miss Latham made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and when she reached India again obediently went to live a contemplative life in a tent near Kalwan. In 1936 she went far from any white people to Tarhabad, among the poverty-stricken Bhills. When the monsoon failed they faced starvation and Miss Latham set to work to arouse &#145;the conscience of the whole community, Indian and English, official and private&#146;  (Lloyd). With a small band of workers she began to open schools, founded a society for redeeming villagers from debt to moneylenders, and secured some training in horticulture and chicken farming for them. She interviewed the prime minister and got promises of food until harvest time. &#145;It is the importunate widow who comes to mind when I think of Jane Latham&#146;, said a clerical colleague. &#145;She was loved and revered throughout the whole countryside&#146; as the horrified bishop wrote when he returned from furlough and discovered that &#145;she had begun to do all the things she had promised me she would not do&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>For this work Miss Latham received the kaisar-i-Hind gold medal in 1936. In that year she became a tertiary of the Franciscan community Crista Prema Seva Sangha, whose mother house was at Poona, and to this she left all her property by will.<br>
<br>When in July 1938 Miss Latham was attacked by dysentery she was brought to the Canada Hospital in Nasik, and there she died on 5 August 1938; she was buried in Nasik cemetery. Hers had been an &#145;heroic and costly way of life&#146;.<br>
