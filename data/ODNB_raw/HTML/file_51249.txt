<span class="headword">Joly de Lotbini&egrave;re,  Seymour</span>  (1905&#150;1984), <span class="occ">broadcasting executive</span>, was born on 21 October 1905 at Elibank, Taplow, Buckinghamshire, the younger of the two sons of Brigadier-General Henri Gustave Joly de Lotbini&egrave;re (1868&#150;1960) of the Royal Engineers and his wife, Mildred Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Charles Seymour Grenfell, a stockbroker, of Elibank. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34219/', "Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini&#232;re (1829&#150;1908)")</script>, lieutenant-governor of British Columbia. As his parents were in India, de Lotbini&egrave;re and his brother spent their school holidays with their aristocratic English relatives. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a first class (division two) in part one of the economics tripos in 1926 and a second class (division two) in part two of the law tripos in 1927. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn, but after practising at the Chancery bar for three years he left in 1932 to join the talks department of the BBC.<br>
<br>In 1935 de Lotbini&egrave;re was appointed director of outside broadcasts. The outside broadcasts unit was responsible for any broadcast not transmitted from a BBC studio, and included the Christmas day royal broadcasts, the maiden voyage of the <i>Queen Mary</i> in 1936, the coronation of George VI in 1937, and major sporting events such as the Grand National, the boat race, and the cup final. In the early days of outside broadcasts the commentators tended to be experts, but de Lotbini&egrave;re realized that it was better to use an eloquent speaker, an expert with the microphone, to describe the event, helped by a second commentator, an expert on the event being broadcast, who could be invited to add his comments as required. De Lotbini&egrave;re was responsible for developing the art of the live running commentary, during which it was important to keep up the suspense, describing the action as it happened. He also believed in &#145;actuality&#146;, picking up the actual sounds of the event, to help the listener to picture the scene: the sounds of horses' feet at the trooping of the colour, or the roar of flames of the Crystal Palace fire. In &#145;The technique of the running commentary&#146; he wrote that the commentator must &#145;allow the sounds to speak for themselves &hellip; In this way, listeners who never could hope to attend coronations and cup finals will get a feeling that broadcasting has enabled them to have a share in these events&#146;  (De Lotbini&egrave;re, &#145;Technique&#146;, 37&#150;40). He listened to all outside broadcasts, usually at home, and held weekly post-mortems.<br>
<br>After eighteen months in Bristol as director of the BBC west region from 1940 to 1941, de Lotbini&egrave;re became director of empire programmes in October 1941, and he was among those responsible for setting up the front line reporting unit (later called the war reporting unit) in 1943. He was in charge of selecting and training two teams of reporters to cover operation Spartan, a big second front exercise in March 1943, which persuaded the War Office that the BBC would need a team of war correspondents to cover the invasion of Europe. As a result, the BBC reporters were given special training attachments with army units preparing for the second front. He was appointed head of the war reporting unit in May 1943.<br>
<br>De Lotbini&egrave;re was sent to Canada in October 1943 as the BBC representative in Toronto, chosen partly because his family was well known in Canada. Responsible to the director-general for all BBC policy and practice in Canada, he organized the re-broadcasting by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation of BBC programmes, and the exchange of programmes between the two countries. In 1944, in Quebec Cathedral, he married Mona (<i>d</i>. 1993), daughter of Professor T. Lewis of Brecon: she had been his secretary at the BBC. They had one son.<br>
<br>At the end of the war de Lotbini&egrave;re returned to his former job as director of outside broadcasts, and built up a strong team of commentators, including Raymond Baxter, Wynford Vaughan Thomas, Brian Johnston, and John Snagge. From 1948 to 1952 he was head of outside broadcasts, in charge of both sound and television, covering events such as the wedding of Princess Elizabeth in 1947, the Olympic games in 1948, and the Festival of Britain in 1951, and in 1952 he himself did the television commentary on the funeral procession of George VI at Windsor, his first television assignment. In 1950 the outside broadcasts unit presented the first televised election broadcast, with a programme of results from the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> results board in Trafalgar Square. He was in charge of all BBC negotiations on sports broadcasting, and persuaded the BBC to spend more on sport, thus securing better contracts.<br>
<br>Sound and television outside broadcasts were split in 1952, with de Lotbini&egrave;re choosing to take television, and he was in charge of the television coverage of the coronation of Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953, the biggest broadcasting operation in the history of the BBC. He was helped by his military and upper-class background in his discussions with the palace, which at first refused to allow cameras or commentators inside Westminster Abbey. De Lotbini&egrave;re, who was appointed OBE in 1953 for the coronation broadcast, told Richard Dimbleby, who headed the team of commentators inside the abbey, &#145;we seem to have achieved something beyond most people's dreams&#146;  (J. Dimbleby, <span class="italic">Richard Dimbleby</span>, 1975, 247&#150;8). He was appointed CVO by the queen in 1956 in recognition of the help he had given George VI with his Christmas broadcasts.<br>
<br>De Lotbini&egrave;re left outside broadcasting in 1955 to become assistant controller of programmes, television, and in 1956 became controller of programme services, television, but he found administration less and less interesting. He was appointed controller of the west region in 1963, and retired in 1967 to Suffolk, where he bought his father's former house.<br>
<br>In the 1930s de Lotbini&egrave;re had lived for several years at Toynbee Hall, taking a group from the East End hop picking and camping in Kent every summer. This concern for people characterized his whole life, and was one reason why he left his lucrative but personally unfulfilling career as a chancery barrister. Highly regarded and much loved by his colleagues, de Lotbini&egrave;re was nicknamed Lobby. At 6 feet 8&frac12; inches, he was the tallest man in the BBC, a source of amazement to George V, who claimed to have met the tallest man in Britain. Living in the flint-knapping country of the Suffolk&#150;Norfolk border, de Lotbini&egrave;re became a world expert on gun flints, and was called in during the excavations of the <i>Mary Rose</i> to date gun flints discovered in the wreck. He died on 6 November 1984 at his home, Brandon Hall, Brandon, Suffolk, and was cremated on 12 November following a funeral service in St Peter's Church, Brandon.<br>
