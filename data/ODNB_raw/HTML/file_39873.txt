<span class="headword">Lacey,  Janet</span>  (1903&#150;1988), <span class="occ">charity director</span>, was born in Sunderland on 25 October 1903, the younger child and younger daughter of Joseph Lacey, property agent, who had been born within the sound of Bow Bells, and his wife, Elizabeth Smurthwaite, from the north of England. Her father died when Janet was ten, and her sister, Sadie, died of cancer in mid-life. She went to various schools in Sunderland before going to drama school in Durham. Her family were fairly narrow Methodists, mostly teetotal, though her father &#145;drank whisky like water&#146;. It may have been her father's death that caused Janet's mother to send her to live with an aunt in Durham.<br>
<br>Although she toured in the theatre world for three years, Janet Lacey found it hard to make a living. At the age of twenty-two she applied to the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) for work, and in 1926 was sent to the YWCA at Kendal to train as a youth leader. She stayed there for six years. Her skills in drama were fully used, and she received her first introduction to theology. Later she became an Anglican. During the general strike of 1926 she saw much poverty in Durham pit villages and became a Labour supporter. In 1932 she moved to Dagenham, London, to a job which used many of her gifts, in a mixed YMCA&#150;YWCA community centre at the heart of a vast new housing estate which provided activities &#145;from the cradle to the grave&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1945 Lacey became YMCA education secretary to the British army of the Rhine, which was slowly being demobilized. It was typical of her that she used the post to bring young British soldiers together with young Germans and with refugees. She learned much about running programmes of social aid and made her first contacts with ecumenical church leaders such as Bishop Hans Lilje and Bishop George Bell. She said she would go about whispering to herself: &#145;I must not get used to this devastation.&#146; Her capacity for compassion shaped her career.<br>
<br>Lacey was appointed youth secretary of the British Council of Churches in 1947, a job which introduced her to the World Council of Churches. She was a significant presence at its four assemblies: at Amsterdam, Evanston, New Delhi, and Uppsala. For the second assembly she wrote and produced a dramatic presentation, <span class="italic">By the Waters of Babylon</span> (1956). She got to know intimately many of the leaders of the world church, such as Visser't Hooft. In Britain the peak of her work was the Bangor youth conference in 1951.<br>
<br>By 1952 Lacey needed a task which would use her full talents. In December that year she was appointed secretary (the term &#145;director&#146; was only used later) of Inter-Church Aid (from 1960 Christian Aid), a post she held until 1968. She worked from both Geneva and London, helping to establish many other important bodies such as Voluntary Service Overseas and World Refugee Year, but her greatest contribution was to conceive Christian Aid Week. This was wholly her idea and she executed it with characteristic flair. The first week raised only &pound;25,000 but by the time she retired it was raising &pound;2 million a year. &#145;Need not creed&#146; was her slogan as she stumped not only Britain but the world.<br>
<br>Lacey was tough and stocky; without being tall she confronted others as being a tower of strength. She was a formidable, autocratic leader, often infuriating, but her compassion in action caused even her critics to admire her. She was blunt to a fault. She was a skilled manager, but not as humane in her management as the really good manager needs to be, so that after she retired from Christian Aid, her years as director of the Family Welfare Association (1969&#150;73) were not a total success. She more successfully reorganized the Churches' Council for Health and Healing (1973&#150;7). Although she could run huge organizations, she could not boil an egg: nevertheless she loved entertaining her friends&#151;at restaurants. She adored the theatre, music, and sculpture.<br>
<br>After her great contribution to World Refugee Year, she was appointed CBE in 1960. In 1967 she became the first woman to preach in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1970 her autobiographical volume, <span class="italic">A Cup of Water</span>, was published. Late in life she was prepared for confirmation by Father St John Groser, the socialist East End priest. She was awarded an honorary DD from Lambeth in 1975. Her retirement in her Westminster flat was happy&#151;she would welcome her many friends from all corners of the globe&#151;until she became a victim of Alzheimer's disease. She died, unmarried, in a nursing home at 11&#150;13 Ladbroke Terrace, Kensington, on 11 July 1988, after having spent several years living there.<br>
