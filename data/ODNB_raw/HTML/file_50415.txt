<span class="headword">Macdonald, Sir  Peter George</span>  (1898&#150;1983), <span class="occ">biscuit entrepreneur</span>, was born on 20 February 1898 at Darnaway, near Forres, Moray, the son of William Macdonald, head gamekeeper to the earl of Moray, and his wife, Annie Cameron. He was educated at Forres Academy, but left early and joined a sequence of Scottish regiments during the First World War. These included the Black Watch and the Lovat Scouts, a corps of highlanders skilled in hunting and stalking.<br>
<br>After demobilization Macdonald trained with the earl's Edinburgh solicitors to become a land agent. However, with an ex-serviceman's grant he studied law at Edinburgh University and moved into wider legal spheres in the firm of W. and J. Burness, with which he was associated (latterly as a consultant) until his death. In 1927 he became a writer to the signet, and two years later he married Rachel Irene (<i>d</i>. 1990), daughter of the Revd Robert Forgan DD of Edinburgh. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Through his friendship in the 1930s with Sir Alexander Grant, also from Moray, Macdonald was made legal adviser to the biscuit manufacturers McVitie and Price. After Grant's death in 1937 he worked closely with his son and successor as chairman, Sir Robert McVitie Grant. During the Second World War Macdonald served as regional deferment officer for the Board of Trade's Edinburgh office; he was also on the staff of the regional commissioner for Scotland. When Sir Robert Grant died in 1947, Macdonald was elected chairman and managing director of McVitie and Price.<br>
<br>In 1948 McVitie and Price and the Glasgow-based Macfarlane Lang &amp; Co. Ltd amalgamated as United Biscuits Ltd; their joint pre-merger profits were &pound;450,000. As the first group chairman Macdonald set his stamp on the new enterprise through a combination of personality (he could be ruthless) and brainpower. He possessed great financial acumen, and backed the bold policy of concentrating McVitie and Price's output on a few leading brands of biscuit, most notably Digestive and Rich Tea. Group profits exceeded &pound;2 million in 1957. However, United Biscuits remained no more than a holding company, with the respective units producing and marketing independently of each other.<br>
<br>Between 1962 and 1966 three further biscuit companies, William Crawford &amp; Sons Ltd, William Macdonald &amp; Sons Ltd, and Meredith and Drew Ltd, joined the group. The resulting organizational upheavals, and the pressures of intensified outside competition, led Macdonald in 1964 to hire the management consultants McKinsey &amp; Co. They recommended the complete integration of all activities, and in 1965 Hector Laing (later Baron Laing of Dunphail), a grandson of Sir Alexander Grant, became group managing director, charged with carrying out this restructuring. In consequence, four out of the five Scottish factories had to be closed and administration was concentrated in London. By 1967, when Macdonald retired, United Biscuits was the largest biscuit company in Britain, with a turnover of &pound;67 million and pre-tax profits of over &pound;5 million. The national market leader in biscuits, it had also diversified into snack foods, packaged cakes, and bakery products.<br>
<br>A committed delegator, Macdonald undertook a range of outside activities. He became a director of several major insurance companies and chairman of various textile firms. He sat on the council of the Institute of Directors and was founder of the institute's Scottish branch. A Conservative, he was knighted in 1963 for political and public services. He supported many charities, but without publicity.<br>
<br>With large features and an impressive physical presence, Macdonald had a lawyer's concern for &#145;small print&#146; but also the entrepreneur's urge to think big. He frequently used his recreations of fishing, shooting, and golf to foster business contacts. He served as JP for the city of Edinburgh and in 1966 as deputy lieutenant for Edinburgh. An active but undoctrinaire member of the Church of Scotland, he was an elder in Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, and by his own efforts raised from industry no less than &pound;250,000 to finance an extension scheme for the Church of Scotland. He maintained his Scottish roots to the last, dying at his home, 18 Hermitage Drive, Edinburgh, on 21 July 1983.<br>
