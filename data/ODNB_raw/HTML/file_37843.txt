<span class="headword">Pemell,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">physician</span>, seems to have spent most of his working life in the cloth town of Cranbrook in Kent. He may have been connected with the Pemyll family of Egerton. Nothing is known of his education except that he did not lay claim to any degree. He was probably the Robert Pemel who obtained an archiepiscopal licence to practise medicine about 1632. He may have shared in the puritan tendency of Cranbrook: his published works were all printed for the London theological bookseller Philemon Stephens, and produced in the early 1650s, at a time when publication in both the learned languages and the vernacular greatly increased.<br>
<br>Pemell's last work, on the diseases of children, was only the second monograph on the subject in English, the first being that of Thomas Phaer a hundred years earlier. General advice books directed at women, parents, or householders were, however, already a well-established genre. At various points Pemell's book on children directs the reader to fuller discussions contained in his earlier publications.<br>
<br>Pemell's publications were all in the vernacular, but showed some knowledge of Latin, and were derived from classical and contemporary learned authors, with a few references to his own experience. As R. P. he first published <span class="italic">De morbis capitis, or, Of the Chief Internall Diseases of the Head</span> (1650). A dedicatory Latin poem was contributed by John Elmeston, schoolmaster of Cranbrook. In the same year appeared <span class="italic"><i>Pt&#333;choupharmakon</i>, seu, Medicamen miseris, or, Pauperum pyxidicula salutifera. Help for the poor</span> (1650). This was aimed less at the poor themselves than at those able to help them and &#145;not able to make use of Physitians and Chirurgians&#146;. A later edition (1653) included an appendix on whether to let blood in smallpox. Pemell's productivity continued with <span class="italic">Tractatus de simplicium medicamentorum facultatibus. A treatise of the nature &hellip; of such simples as are most frequently used</span> (1652). This was helpfully structured for &#145;the vulgar capacity&#146; and young practitioners. A second part, <span class="italic">Tractatus de facultatibus simplicium</span>, followed in 1653. His final work, on children, he advertised as fulfilling his promise to follow up the <span class="italic">Tractatus</span>, but in &#145;more hast&#146;, because &#145;I see my glasse runs apace&#146;: <span class="italic">De morbis puerorum, or, A treatise of the diseases of children &hellip; very useful for all such as are housekeepers</span> (1653).<br>
<br>Pemell's will was dated 7 April 1652, he being then in &#145;good health&#146;; he was buried in Cranbrook on 3 June 1653. He left a widow, Elizabeth, and three children, all under age. The eldest, Thomas, was to have &#145;all my books in case he betake himself to the study and practice of physic&#146;.<br>
