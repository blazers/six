<span class="headword">Tidy,  Charles Meymott</span>  (1843&#150;1892), <span class="occ">sanitary and analytical chemist</span>, was born on 2 February 1843 at Cambridge Heath, Hackney, Middlesex, the third son of William Callender Tidy, surgeon, and his wife, Charlotte Meymott. After attending Hackney Church of England school, he entered the London Hospital as a student under Henry Letheby, taking his LSA and MRCS in 1864. In 1865 he entered the University of Aberdeen, graduating CM and MB with the highest honours in 1866.<br>
<br>After returning to London, Tidy took up his father's medical practice in Hackney for about ten years. During this time he was joint lecturer in chemistry with Henry Letheby at the London Hospital medical college. Under Letheby's influence Tidy gradually became interested in questions of sanitary reform and public health, and became one of the first public analysts appointed under the <span class="roman">Adulteration of Food Act</span> of 1872, being responsible for Hertfordshire, Essex, and the boroughs of Islington and Whitechapel. When Letheby died in 1876 Tidy took over as professor of chemistry, medical jurisprudence, and public health, and also succeeded him as medical officer of health for the City of London. Tidy married Violet Fordham Dobell, daughter of Horace Dobell, physician, on 5 October 1875; they had a son and a daughter. Their son, Sir Henry Letheby Tidy (1877&#150;1960), was one-time dean of St Thomas's Hospital and an extra-physician to George VI and Elizabeth II.<br>
<br>The London Hospital had a tradition of championing defendants in poisoning trials, stemming from a rivalry between Henry Letheby and Alfred Swaine Taylor, of Guy's, which dated back to the Tawell case, in Slough, in 1845. In 1881 Tidy advised the defence counsel for Dr George Lamson, accused of poisoning his nineteen-year-old brother-in-law with aconite. Tidy asked to be present at the prosecution's toxicological analysis of the victim's remains, but his request was refused. A week after the trial, in 1882, the home secretary was asked in the House of Commons whether it would not be more satisfactory for defendants to be represented professionally at such analyses. In response, the home secretary asked the royal colleges of physicians and surgeons to appoint two independent experienced men of science who could be consulted in cases of this kind. The Royal College of Surgeons appointed Tidy to be one of the first two Home Office analysts. His fees were paid by the Home Office and his independence would seem to stem from the fact that he could appear either for the defence or the prosecution. In 1889 Tidy appeared for the defence in the trial of Florence Maybrick for the murder of her husband. Cautious, modest, and precise in court, Tidy genuinely believed that James Maybrick did not die from arsenic poisoning and that only a medicinal quantity of the substance was present in the body. Tidy wrote two books on medical jurisprudence. The first, <span class="italic">A Handy-Book of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology</span>, with W. B. Woodman, appeared in 1877. The second, <span class="italic">Legal Medicine</span>, prepared from lecture notes, appeared under his sole authorship in 1882.<br>
<br>Tidy was also keen to improve the health of the metropolis with a pure water supply. He published <span class="italic">The London Water Supply</span> in 1878, closely followed by a paper on &#145;The process for determining the organic purity of potable waters&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> (1879, 46&#150;106). This was a scholarly and painstaking analysis of monthly samples supplied by the metropolitan water companies over the previous nine years. It was followed by an equally exacting undertaking in his paper &#145;River water&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>, 1880, 268&#150;327). In 1881 he, together with Professor Odling and William Crookes, was appointed by the London water companies to examine the quality of the city's water.<br>
<br>Tidy's position as professor of medical jurisprudence and his frequent experience in courts of law convinced him that a counsel thoroughly acquainted with medicine and chemistry was an urgent requirement. He therefore took up the study of law and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1885; he was later appointed reader in medical jurisprudence to the inns of court. Tidy received the Royal College of Physicians' Swiney prize for legal medicine in 1889. He was on the examining boards of the royal colleges of physicians and surgeons, and was a fellow of the Chemical Society, being at one time vice-president of the Institute of Chemistry. In 1888 he gave the Christmas lectures to young people at the London Institution and took as his theme &#145;The story of a tinder-box: the romance of science&#146;, in which he described the history of matches and firelighting methods. These lectures were published as a book under the same title in 1889. Besides the works mentioned Tidy wrote <span class="italic">A Handbook of Modern Chemistry</span> (1878, 1887) and contributed many journal papers on chemistry, medicine, and toxicology. He died at his home at 3 Mandeville Place, London, on 15 March 1892, having suffered from cancer for the previous five years.<br>
