<span class="headword">Dennie,  William Henry</span>  (1789&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Deptford, Kent, on 22 June 1789, the son of Henry Dennie, barrister, of London, and his wife, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1856), daughter of William Steele and granddaughter of Laurence Steele of Rathbride, co. Kildare. Through General the Hon. Edward Fox, Dennie's widowed mother obtained for him an ensigncy in the 22nd foot, dated 1 January 1800. He became lieutenant in August 1804 and captain on 4 October 1810. He first joined the regiment after its arrival in India in 1802, and won Lord Lake's approval by his conduct during a minor regimental mutiny.<br>
<br>Dennie served with the regiment throughout Lake's campaigns in India in 1804&#150;5, at the capture of Mauritius in 1810, and afterwards in Mauritius, the Channel Islands, and Ireland. While in Mauritius, where he commanded the coastal defences at Black River, he married, on 20 May 1818, Marie Genevi&egrave;ve Aim&eacute;e Butti&eacute;, the divorced wife of Jean Jerome Toussaint. They had two sons and a daughter. After obtaining his majority in April 1821 he exchanged to the 13th foot (soon made light infantry) and went to India. With the 13th light infantry he served during the First Anglo-Burmese War, in which he distinguished himself and was severely wounded; he was awarded a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy and a CB. He served with his regiment in the army of the Indus in 1838&#150;9.<br>
<br>When General Nott was appointed to the 2nd division of the army, Dennie succeeded to the command of Nott's sepoy brigade, and was employed in Sind, Baluchistan, and Lower Afghanistan. He quarrelled with General Keane early in the Afghan campaign and General Nott took an instant dislike to him. His services were unacknowledged at headquarters, where there appears to have been a desire to make him a scapegoat for the administrative blundering of the Afghan campaign. He led the storming party at the capture of Ghazni but, as he was at the time in disfavour at headquarters, the Ghazni honours conferred on some of his juniors were withheld from him. He complained respectfully but bitterly to the Indian authorities and the Horse Guards, without redress. Fiery and romantically chivalrous, as a writer in the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazette</span> described him, Dennie appears to have been irritably impatient of acts of injustice which would scarcely have moved a less sensitive man. During the occupation of Kabul, Dennie was dispatched with a small force in September 1840 against part of the army of Dost Muhammad, which, after a series of brilliant manoeuvres and though greatly outnumbered, he decisively defeated at Bamian on 18 September. Dost Muhammad surrendered immediately afterwards and the campaign ended.<br>
<br>In October 1841 a brigade under Sir Robert Sale was sent from Kabul against Afghan insurgents who had occupied the Khurd Kabul Pass. This brigade, which included the 13th light infantry, seized the ruined fortress of Jalalabad and rendered themselves &#145;illustrious&#146; by its subsequent defence from November 1841 to April 1842. Dennie commanded the rear-guard in the operations in the Khurd Kabul between 9 and 30 October, and, when Sir Robert Sale was wounded, succeeded to the command of the force, which he held during the greater part of the defence of Jalalabad. In the sortie of 7 April 1842 Dennie was shot through the body when riding at the head of his regiment and died soon after. He was buried in a bastion used as a graveyard by the garrison. Tablets to commemorate his bravery were erected at St Peter's Church, Fort William, Calcutta, and St Mary's Church, Carisbrooke, Isle of Wight. His services had been recognized by his appointment as aide-de-camp to the queen. He died after forty-two years' military service, mostly in India, during which he had purchased every step of regimental rank. After his death, Dennie's letters from the Anglo-Afghan War were published as <span class="italic">Personal Narrative of Campaigns in Affghanistan, Sinde, Beloochistan</span> (1843); they reveal that his courage and military qualities notwithstanding, Dennie was quick to take offence and frequently at odds with his superiors. He appears to have been assertive, sometimes obstructive, and often quarrelsome, but a fine fighting soldier.<br>
