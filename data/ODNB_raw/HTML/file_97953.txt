</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lindsay,  Lionel Arthur</span>  (1861&#150;1945), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at Mansion House, St Mary's, Brecon, on 27 March 1861, the third son in the family of six sons and one daughter of Henry Gore Lindsay (1830&#150;1914), army officer and chief constable, and his wife, Ellen Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1912), the fourth daughter of Charles Morgan Robinson Morgan, MP for Brecon, who was created first Baron Tredegar in 1859. The theorist of mechanized warfare <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34540/', "Major-General George Mackintosh Lindsay")</script> was his youngest brother.<br>
<br>Lindsay's father, Henry Gore Lindsay, belonged to a landowning family, of Glasnevin House, co. Dublin, and served as a captain in the rifle brigade in the Cape Frontier War of 1852&#150;3, the Crimean War, and the Indian mutiny. After his marriage he settled in south Wales, where he was lieutenant-colonel in the Brecknockshire rifle volunteers, and was the second chief constable of Glamorgan from 1867 until 1891, when he retired to Glasnevin House, which he had recently inherited.<br>
<br>Lionel Lindsay was educated at the Royal Academy, Gosport, and in Germany. From 1884 to 1889 he served as adjutant-major and inspector of the Egyptian gendarmerie. In 1889 he became police superintendent of the Merthyr Tudful division of the Glamorgan constabulary, succeeding his father as chief constable in 1891.<br>
<br>Lindsay's significance lies in the turbulent relationship he had with the labour movement for over forty years. An avowed Conservative, Lindsay aligned himself with the employers and landed gentry, in whose social circles he moved. He looked upon strikers, demonstrators, and union activists as lawbreakers and sedition-mongers. He was an enthusiast for the use of force to break up demonstrations (believing it to have a salutary effect upon protesters) and compiled dossiers on those he regarded as potential subversives.<br>
<br>Lindsay's aggression was noted in 1898, when a body of striking but peaceful colliers crossed the county boundary from Monmouthshire into Glamorgan, to be met by baton charges led by Lindsay himself. This episode generated widespread criticism, but such notoriety was exceeded during the disputes in the Rhondda and Cynon valleys in 1910&#150;11, the epicentre being the rioting outside the Cambrian colliery in Llwynypia and the looting of shops in Tonypandy in November 1910. The seriousness of the dispute led to 1500 police being concentrated in the coalfield and to the arrival of regular infantry and cavalry who stayed for months to provide the police with vital support.<br>
<br>Lindsay has been criticized for his one-sided commitment to defending the coal owners' position while being unsympathetic to the workers, even to the point of objecting to peaceful picketing. The union leaders had no faith in Lindsay's even-handedness, and it was widely believed that his close identification with the employers generated alarmist overreaction. It was considered that Lindsay vindictively pursued prosecutions against miners' leaders widely regarded as having done their best to exercise a moderating influence. Finally, Lindsay's preference for the strategy of violent confrontation spilled over into instances of police brutality.<br>
<br>In Lindsay's defence, police action in 1910&#151;unlike many other times in his career&#151;was mainly responsive, not provocative. These were large-scale disturbances involving thousands of rioters determined to intimidate working colliery officials and committing extensive damage to property. The police had little choice but to intervene and call for military assistance if they thought themselves in danger of being overwhelmed. Lindsay's physical courage was undoubted: always in the thick of the action, he suffered injuries to his right leg and hand. Finally the home secretary, Winston Churchill, found it convenient to give the impression that Lindsay had acted immoderately, deleting from official accounts Churchill's own instructions to utilize &#145;vigorous baton charges&#146;. General Nevil Macready, initially cautious when taking overall control of the dispute, increasingly came to adopt the direct methods favoured by Lindsay.<br>
<br>At the time Lindsay was regarded as a hero by his fellow chief constables, but the Home Office came to view him as bellicose and provocative. This reputation was accentuated by Lindsay's behaviour during the First World War, in allowing patriotic crowds to break up anti-war meetings and ferociously instigating prosecutions against socialist activists. The Home Office was reluctant to join in a crusade regarded as expensive, indiscriminate, and potentially counter-productive. Whereas Lindsay had successfully brought thirty-five cases up to the end of 1916, only one of forty he recommended in 1917 was followed through.<br>
<br>Lindsay's campaign against socialism and trade unionism continued into peace time, climaxing during the seismic industrial disputes of the 1920s. In 1921 Lindsay used troops and &#145;flying squads&#146; of police in often stage-managed physical confrontations with pickets. He followed this with arrests of union activists, who sometimes had their houses ransacked by the police for good measure. At the end of the dispute the total of summonses in Glamorgan was much higher than those of other coalmining districts, despite its relatively peaceful nature. The vast majority of those committed for trial subsequently had the charges against them withdrawn for lack of evidence, Lindsay feeling aggrieved at what he regarded as half-hearted support from the Home Office and dismayed by the leniency shown by the courts.<br>
<br>From 1926 Lindsay was sympathetic to the &#145;non-political&#146; South Wales Miners' Industrial Union, which was threatening the longer established South Wales Miners' Federation. He urged his subordinates to protect working miners against intimidation from South Wales Miners' Federation loyalists, and again resorted to mass prosecutions: 395 charges were brought at the Glamorgan assizes of November 1926. The antipathy between the two unions eventually came to a head in the mid-1930s, with bitter and intense battles in collieries and communities between rival groups. Lindsay relished the conflict: in October 1935 he took direct control of the situation at the Taff-Merthyr colliery, supervising baton charges into a crowd hostile to the South Wales Miners' Industrial Union, action that triggered further disturbances in proximate valleys. Fifty-seven summonses were in due course issued in the biggest mass trial of industrial workers ever held in Britain, in March 1936. All were found guilty, but many observers complained at the &#145;political&#146; nature of much of the evidence levelled against the accused.<br>
<br>Lindsay never enjoyed an easy relationship with his standing joint committee. He was insulated from democratic accountability, happily ignoring repeated censures issued by Labour county councillors, often magistrates themselves, who saw Lindsay as articulating a distinctive anti-working-class ethos.<br>
<br>Never married, Lindsay was devoted to his career, and expected his men to emulate his dedication and commitment. He was a vigorous advocate of their interests in matters of pay and conditions, founding a mutual benefit association in 1914. He was capable of inspiring deep loyalty in his subordinates (&#145;one of the finest Chief Constables in the country&#146; was how one remembered him in 1973), but by the 1930s some were uneasy with his inflexible approach to industrial conflict. When he passed the age of seventy-five, pressure from the standing joint committee on him to resign intensified, and he did so on 7 December 1936.<br>
<br>Lindsay was appointed MVO in 1912 and OBE in 1920. Dedicated in his pursuit of personal fitness, he enjoyed sports, including boxing, cricket, cycling, hockey, horse riding, hunting, ice skating, polo, rowing, rugby football, shooting, swimming, and tennis, many of which he pursued well into his old age. He sang, played the violin, and participated in amateur dramatics and operatics. An Anglican, he died at his home, 94 Cardiff Road, Llandaff, on 15 April 1945 and was buried on the 20th at St James's Church, Leckwith, Cardiff.<br>
<br>Lindsay remains a controversial figure&#151;&#145;the apotheosis of the atmosphere of conflict between police and labour&#146;  (Morgan, &#145;Police and labour&#146;, 16). Under his leadership the Glamorgan constabulary acquired a reputation for violence and brutality in industrial disputes. He was labelled an &#145;arch-thug&#146; by Arthur Horner, president of the South Wales Miners' Federation, and many have concluded that he was autocratic and militaristic, his approach increasingly anachronistic and unnecessarily confrontational in a democratic society. The miners' historian Page Arnot provides an uncharacteristically witty verdict: &#145;Captain Lindsay had begun his career as part of the British Army of Occupation in Egypt: and &hellip; he never quite disabused himself of the notion that he was part of a Coalmasters' Army of Occupation in South Wales&#146;  (Arnot, 182).<br>
