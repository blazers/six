<span class="headword">Petillius Cerialis <span class="st"> [Petillius Cerialis Caesius Rufus]</span>,  Quintus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60&#150;<em>c.</em>74), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, was related by marriage to the emperor Vespasian, almost certainly as the husband of Vespasian's only daughter, Flavia Domitilla. The consul of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 83, Quintus Petillius Rufus, is generally considered to be his son from a previous marriage; another possible son is a senator called Petillius Firmus, who came from Arretium (Arezzo)&#151;if the conjectured relationship is correct, this was Cerialis's home town. From the presumed marriage with Domitilla there was a daughter of the same names as her mother. Cerialis's presumed father, Petillius Rufus, was a senator in the reign of Tiberius, when &#145;he stooped to a shameful deed in the hope of becoming consul, but later met his just deserts&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, iv.68 ff). This story in the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, combined with the tone of numerous references in the <span class="italic">Histories</span> and the account in <span class="italic">Annals</span> xiv. of Cerialis's conduct in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60, suggests that Tacitus heartily disliked Cerialis, the former chief of his own father-in-law, Agricola. In the fashion of the time, Cerialis himself had two extra names, which indicate kinship with a family of Caesii. One of his predecessors as legate of the ninth legion, Caesius Nasica, might well have been a kinsman.<br>
<br>Cerialis's first known appointment was as legate of the ninth at the time of the great rebellion in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60 or 61. After the destruction of the Roman capital, Camulodunum (Colchester), by Queen Boudicca's forces, Cerialis, &#145;coming to help, was routed and his infantry was slaughtered; he himself with the cavalry escaped to his base [presumably Longthorpe near Peterborough], where he was protected by the fortifications&#146;, according to Tacitus, who further described his defeat as &#145;a disaster&#146; (<i>clades</i>)  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.32). The ninth legion had to be brought up to strength after the revolt by the dispatch of two thousand men from the Rhine army. In spite of this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, Cerialis had &#145;a not inglorious military reputation&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Histories</span>, iii.59) nine years later (his activity in the intervening years is unknown), when he was chosen to command a special force of one thousand cavalry in the Flavian advance guard's assault on Rome in December of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69, the so-called &#145;year of the four emperors&#146;. Further reasons for his selection, mentioned by Tacitus, were his kinship with Vespasian and his local knowledge, suggesting that he had property in Etruria or Umbria (which accords with the probable origin at Arretium). As it turned out, he bungled the task, being heavily defeated by the Vitellians in the outskirts of Rome and failing to prevent the burning of the Capitol, &#145;the most shameful deed in the history of Rome&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Histories</span>, iii.72). Shortly afterwards, when a delegation from the senate arrived to negotiate, Cerialis was unable to prevent his men from mishandling the senators.<br>
<br>No doubt because of his kinship with Vespasian, Cerialis was none the less within a few weeks given an important new mission. He was made consul (presumably <i>in absentia</i>) or perhaps simply given the rank of ex-consul, the necessary qualification for appointment as governor and commander-in-chief of the Lower German army, with the task of suppressing the dangerous revolt of the Batavians and other German or north Gallic peoples. His operations in the Rhineland are described in detail by Tacitus in his <span class="italic">Histories</span>. A famous speech before an assembly of rebellious Gauls, put in the mouth of Cerialis, who begins with the immortal phrase &#145;neque ego umquam facundiam exercui&#146; (&#145;unaccustomed as I am to public speaking&#146;; Tacitus, <span class="italic">Histories</span>, iv.73), has been called the finest justification of Roman imperialism ever written. There is of course no guarantee that it represents anything that Cerialis himself actually said. He is also given some credit for his tactful handling of the embarrassing attempt by Vespasian's younger son, Domitian, then only nineteen, to assume command of the campaign. But in general the impression conveyed is that Cerialis succeeded rather by good luck than by good generalship. On one occasion he narrowly escaped capture by the enemy, who seized the flagship of the Rhine flotilla during the night in the belief that the Roman commander was on board. However, Cerialis &#145;was sharing a bed on land with an Ubian woman, named Claudia Sacrata&#146; (as Tacitus drily reports in <span class="italic">Histories</span>, v.22). The final outcome of the campaign is not recorded; the last surviving page of Tacitus's account has Cerialis negotiating on an island with the rebel leader Julius Civilis in the second half of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70. Cerialis's settlement evidently guaranteed the maintenance of certain privileges for the Batavians, whose fighting qualities continued to be highly prized by Rome, in return for them laying down their arms.<br>
<br>Cerialis proceeded straight from the northern Rhineland to take over the governorship of Britain from Marcus Vettius Bolanus, who had been struggling to keep the peace with a diminished garrison. Cerialis brought extra troops and at once began a forward policy, aimed at subduing the Brigantes of the Pennines, who had overthrown their pro-Roman ruler, Cartimandua (Bolanus had had to rescue the queen), and were now openly hostile under her ex-husband, Venutius. The archaeological record shows that Cerialis established bases at Eburacum (York) for his old legion, the ninth, and a forward post at Luguvalium (Carlisle); he probably penetrated into southern Scotland as well. The other legions were now based at Lindum (Lincoln), at Viroconium (Wroxter) or Deva (Chester), and at Isca (Caerleon). Cerialis's governorship of Britain is only briefly described by Tacitus, in the <span class="italic">Agricola</span>, the sole source. He is said to have overrun, if not to have completely conquered, the Brigantes; and Gnaeus Julius Agricola, serving under Cerialis as legate of the twentieth legion, had the opportunity for gaining distinction, even if &#145;the glory had to be reserved for his chief&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Agricola</span>, 17). Cerialis had probably been replaced by the summer of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 73; he was at any rate back at Rome by the spring of 74, when he held a second consulship (the record of which is the sole evidence for his full names). Nothing is heard of him thereafter. That the consul of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 83, Quintus Petillius Rufus, Cerialis's presumed son, was one of the first consular colleagues of the new emperor Domitian (<i>r</i>. <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 81&#150;96), suggests that the family enjoyed that ruler's favour, at least initially. But Cerialis's presumed daughter, Domitilla, a niece of Domitian, was married to the emperor's cousin Titus Flavius Clemens, who was executed in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 95; and Cerialis and his family seem to have disappeared from the scene by the early second century, for the poet Martial refers to the &#145;Petillian mansion&#146;  (Martial, <span class="italic">Epigrams</span>, xii.57, 19) at Rome as the residence of another senator at this time.<br>
