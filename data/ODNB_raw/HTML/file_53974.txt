<span class="headword">Chapman,  David Leonard</span>  (1869&#150;1958), <span class="occ">physical chemist</span>, was born on 6 December 1869 in Wells, Norfolk, the eldest son of David Chapman, merchant, who later became a builder in Manchester, and his wife, Maria Wells. The economist and civil servant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32368/', "Sir Sydney John Chapman")</script> was his younger brother. He attended Manchester grammar school, from where he won an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, taking first-class honours in chemistry in 1893 and second-class honours in physics in 1894. After a short period as science master at Giggleswick School he was appointed in 1897 to the chemistry staff at Manchester University. In 1907 Jesus College, Oxford, which had just equipped itself with a large teaching and research laboratory, elected him fellow and tutor to take charge of the scientific work. This laboratory, the last to be run by an Oxford college, remained open until three years after Chapman's retirement in 1944. He acted as senior proctor, served on university boards and committees, and was vice-principal of his college in 1926&#150;44. He was elected FRS in 1913. In 1918 he married <a href="#cosubject_53974">Muriel Catherine Canning Holmes [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>As a tutor Chapman was devoted to his pupils, as they were to him. Research, however, was his first interest, and this he pursued over many years, assisted by his wife and his students. His approach to research problems was cautious, critical, thorough, and penetrating, relying for inspiration and technique very little on the work of others. Because his standards of proof were very high, he was not disposed to accept readily fresh outlooks put forward by newcomers to his subject, although he never rejected them outright.<br>
<br>The problem which occupied Chapman for the longest period was the mechanism of the photochemical combination of hydrogen and chlorine, which turned out to be extraordinarily difficult to resolve. Chapman established that minute traces of impurities were the cause of the capricious behaviour of the reaction. In 1913 he first suggested the &#145;steady-state hypothesis&#146;, and applied it to intermediates in a chemical reaction. He found that if the light is interrupted by a rotating sector, the rate of the hydrogen&#150;chlorine reaction varies with the sector frequency, and he was the first, in 1926, to work out and use the theory of this effect to measure the &#145;mean life&#146; of a reaction intermediate. The method has since been much used by others.<br>
<br>Chapman carried out research on a variety of other problems in physical chemistry and physics. In 1899 he published an important paper on the theory of detonation in gases, and was able to make reliable calculations of detonation speeds. His name is still associated with the theory, known as the Chapman&#150;Jouget treatment. In 1913 he published an important paper on the distribution of ions at a charged surface, and the surface layer he envisaged is still called the Gouy&#150;Chapman layer.<br>
<br>Chapman was reserved and somewhat eccentric in manner, particularly in his later years. In his scientific work he was somewhat of a recluse, but he could demonstrate an informal but effective administrative ability when he so wished. His outdoor hobbies were golf and cycling; when he gave these up he continued to be an active walker until the age of eighty-two. Chapman died (of cancer) at his home, 253 Cowley Road, Oxford, on 17 January 1958.<br>

<a name="cosubject_53974"></a><span class="headword">Muriel Catherine Canning Chapman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Holmes]</span></span>  (1894&#150;1988)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 16 September 1894 in Rampisham, Dorset, the eldest daughter of Samuel Holmes, and his wife, Mabel Hoare Canning. About 1900 her father became a scholar, and later a theology lecturer, at Jesus College, Oxford, and she was educated at the Oxford High School for Girls, and then at Royal Holloway College, London, where she gained a BSc degree in 1916. In 1917 she became attached to the Society of Home Students, Oxford (later St Anne's College), and carried out research in chemical kinetics under the supervision of David Leonard Chapman. She matriculated at Oxford in 1920 (the first year that women were permitted to do so).<br>
<br>Muriel Holmes married her supervisor, D. L. Chapman, in 1918, and they had their only child, Ruth, in the following year. Muriel Chapman carried out research on the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine in the laboratories of Jesus College, and was awarded the Oxford BSc degree in 1923. Two research papers based on this work were published in 1923 and 1924. Ten years later she carried out further laboratory work, and a joint paper with her husband appeared in 1937. After about 1927 she became active with the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports. She died at her home, 6 Bainton Road, Oxford, on 23 March 1988.<br>
