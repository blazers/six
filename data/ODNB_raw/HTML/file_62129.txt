<span class="headword">Crowdy,  Edith Frances</span>  (1880&#150;1947), <span class="occ">travel agent and member of the Women's Royal Naval Service</span>, was born on 25 August 1880 at 79 Victoria Road, Wandsworth, London, one of the four daughters of James Crowdy, solicitor, and his wife, Mary Isabel Anne Fuidge. Educated at home, in 1912 she joined her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32647/', "Rachel Eleanor Crowdy")</script> in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), a nursing organization affiliated to the Red Cross, becoming deputy to Katharine Furse, commandant-in-chief. When Furse was appointed director of the newly formed Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) in 1917 Crowdy also left the VAD and joined Furse as deputy director. In this role she was deeply involved in drafting and implementing new regulations for the WRNS. In her tribute written after Crowdy's death in <span class="italic">The Wren</span>, the magazine of the Association of Wrens which Crowdy had helped to found in 1920, Dame Katharine Furse acknowledged Crowdy's contribution to the success of the WRNS in its brief existence, commenting that Crowdy had instilled confidence in everyone by her bold but calm behaviour. Crowdy had been made an honorary serving sister of the order of St John of Jerusalem in recognition of her work with the VAD; in 1919 she was appointed CBE for her services to the WRNS, which was disbanded at the close of hostilities.<br>
<br>Between the wars Crowdy worked for the travel service created by Sir Henry Lunn, and from 1926 she acted as secretary of the Hellenic Travellers Club, enjoying many voyages to the Mediterranean. Although she liked this work, Crowdy left Lunn in 1928 to become the general secretary of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, founded that year, and in 1930 she helped to organize the association's first world conference. But these duties did not fully occupy her, and she soon rejoined Lunn's travel business and took up again the secretaryship of the Hellenic Travellers Club. She also renewed her association with Katharine Furse, who had also joined Lunn's company.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Crowdy joined her sister Isabel who was working as a secretary of the Children's Country Holiday Fund. She helped to organize holidays for children, especially from London, who would not otherwise have the opportunity to visit the countryside. At the same time she advised the government on evacuation plans for children under the age of five. She was still a special case worker for the fund in 1947, with a London address at 100 Beaufort Street, Chelsea, but had been living near Blandford, Dorset, when she suffered a heart attack and died at Herrison House, Charminster, Dorset, on 23 July 1947. She was buried at Blandford on 26 July 1947.<br>
