</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marot,  Daniel</span>  (1661&#150;1752), <span class="occ">architect, designer, and engraver</span>, was born in Paris in 1661, the son of the protestant Jean Marot (1619&#150;1679), engraver and architect, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of the Dutch cabinet-maker Abraham Garbrand. Daniel assisted his father on his engravings of contemporary French architecture, published in 1670 as <span class="italic">L'architecture fran&ccedil;oise</span>, known as the <span class="roman">Grand Marot</span>. From 1677 Daniel worked independently as an engraver for the designers Jean Le Pautre (1618&#150;1682) and Jean Berain (1637&#150;1711), then <i>dessinateur du cabinet et de la chambre</i> to Louis XIV. Marot's prints after Berain included the designs for Lully's opera <span class="italic">Le triomphe de l'amour</span> (1681) and for the funeral in 1683 of Queen Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, wife of Louis XIV. Marot's reputation was enhanced by the engraving of the celebrations marking the birth of the dauphin, 25 August 1682:<blockquote>Faite par un jeune homme qui &eacute;gale deja les plus habile graveurs, et qui se sera autant conna&icirc;tres par luy-mesme, qu'il est connu &agrave; Paris par le nom de feu son pere. Il est fils du Sr Marot, architecte et graveur, qui a laiss&eacute; beaucoup ouvrages au Public. (<span class="italic">Mercure de France</span>, Sept 1682)</blockquote>Daniel Marot left France as a consequence of the persecution of protestants that led to the revocation of the edict of Nantes in October 1685. He went to Holland to join his mother's relatives. There, Jacob Gole, Marot's future brother-in-law, engraved <i>c</i>.1700 Marot's portrait by James Parmentier.<h2>
<a name="MarotatthecourtofWilliamandMaryinHolland"></a>Marot at the court of William and Mary in Holland</h2>The earliest recorded print by Marot in Holland commemorates the ball held in December 1686 at the huis ten Bosch, near The Hague, given by Mary, princess of Orange, to celebrate her husband's birthday. The festive scene, set in the famous Oranjezaal, is framed with allegorical figures and an ornamental cartouche. This etching is signed by Marot as both draughtsman and printmaker and was sold from his house in The Hague and by Jacob Gole in Amsterdam. It carries an effusive dedication to the princess demonstrating that Marot was anxious to attract her patronage.<br>
<br>Two years later Marot engraved <span class="italic">The order of the fleet of his serene highness the lord prince of Orange coming to the help of the English protestants on 11 November 1688</span>, an impression of which is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The forty-nine warships are depicted diagrammatically so that individual vessels can be identified. The coat of arms indicates that the print was published after William and Mary had been crowned joint English monarchs in April 1689.<br>
<br>Marot's role as a visual propagandist for William and Mary was not limited to the production of prints of royal or political events. He became active as a designer encouraging a taste for unified interiors and gardens for royal palaces and for the stately homes of courtiers, in Holland and in England. A wide range of furnishings and decorative paintings were executed to Marot's designs by teams of artists and craftsmen. His first such commission in 1686 was for the staircase, Willemszaal, and marble room at Slot Zeist, near Utrecht, built to the designs of Jacob Roman (the town architect of Leiden) for Willem Adriaan, count of Nassau-Odijk (1632&#150;1705), ambassador to France and a cousin of William of Orange. At Zeist, Marot was also responsible for the layout of the gardens. In the same year, Mary of Orange had laid the foundation stone for the hunting lodge at Het Loo near Apeldoorn. Also built to the designs of Jacob Roman, after 1689 it was extended as a royal palace. In 1692 Daniel Marot designed the illusionistic painting for the staircase inspired by the escalier des ambassadeurs at Versailles. This was painted by a team of decorative artists including the French protestant refugees Pierre Berchet and James Parmentier, both of whom had previously worked in England and were to return there.<br>
<br>At Het Loo, Daniel Marot was responsible for most of the interior decoration. The original painted decoration in the audience room has survived intact, with landscapes painted by Glauber and figures by Gerard de Lairesse. Further evidence for Marot's role is provided by the printed versions of these designs which appeared in The Hague in 1703. They include the new dining-room and the king's library&#151;which was originally intended as a porcelain cabinet for Queen Mary, with a mirrored ceiling&#151;it was only adapted for the king after Mary's early death in 1694. These prints were published in Holland by Marot after William III's death in an endeavour to compensate for the loss of royal patronage and to encourage new commissions. A later print of a state bedchamber which appeared in the <span class="italic">Second livre d'appartements</span> in 1712 may have been based on the original design for the king's bedchamber at Het Loo. It shows the extent to which such a room depended on upholstery for its effect. The walls are draped in fabric which echoes that on the state bed. The set of upholstered chairs is, like the wall hangings, enriched with appliqu&eacute; motifs.<h2>
<a name="Marotpatronageandcontemporaryfurniture"></a>Marot, patronage, and contemporary furniture</h2>In England as in Holland, courtiers were swift to realize Marot's potential and supported his role as a designer of interior furnishings. A rare design drawing signed and dated 1700 by Marot for a mirror, table, and candlestand for William III at Het Loo is endorsed on the back &#145;table at miroir dore pour Loo 17 Sept 1701&#146; (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Similar mirrors with applied carving at the corners and middles were supplied for English patrons. Examples were made for Thomas Coningsby's seat at Hampton Court, Herefordshire.<br>
<br>There is no distinction in quality between the furnishings made to Marot's designs for the monarch and those for leading courtiers. A set of upholstered chairs, dating from the 1690s, with a daybed and paned hangings <i>en suite</i>, survive at Penshurst, Kent. They may have come from one of the English royal palaces, for they belonged to Henry Sidney, first earl of Romney, who was William III's groom of the stole. Or they may have been commissioned for Leicester House, London, refurbished for Lord Romney's elder brother. A daybed and sofa (Temple Newsam, Leeds) made for Thomas Osborne, first duke of Leeds, after 1694 by Philip Guibert may have been designed by Marot; the same maker produced very similar pieces for William III in 1697.<h2>
<a name="Marotandgardendesign"></a>Marot and garden design</h2>As at Zeist, Marot was responsible for designing the garden layout at Het Loo under the supervision of Hans Willem Bentinck, first earl of Portland. The grotto in the corner of the queen's garden consisted of three rooms. The first room was lined with shells and paved with black and white marble; the second room contained a couch or daybed for repose; the third was decorated with porcelain. The king's garden was dominated by a bowling green and the fountain in the centre of the upper garden rose to a height of 45 feet, with thirty-two jets around it.<h2>
<a name="MarotinEngland"></a>Marot in England</h2>It was Marot's skill as a garden designer which led to his first documented English commission, the design for the parterre at Hampton Court Palace, dated August 1689. The design was apparently sent by Marot from Holland and was not executed until 1698. Marot's presence in England is not documented until 1694, although a payment to &#145;Mr. Maro&#146; in September 1693 (Petworth) may indicate that he was already in England. He was not paid for work on the Hampton Court parterre until after he had returned to Holland. In March 1698 Caspar Frederick Henning (paymaster of the money for the use and service of his majesty's gardens at Hampton Court and Newmarket) wrote to the council of Nassau demesne suggesting that Mr Marot should be paid &pound;236 11<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. sterling . In London, Marot was employed by the francophile Ralph, first earl of Montagu, at Montagu House, Bloomsbury, rebuilt after a fire in 1686. Marot also worked for Montagu's son-in-law, Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset (1662&#150;1748), at Petworth, Sussex. As master of the king's wardrobe from 1689, Montagu was aware of Marot's work as an interior designer in both the Dutch and English royal palaces. William III's visit to Montagu's London house in May 1689 stimulated the wish to emulate that unity of interior decoration in his own royal palaces.<br>
<br>A set of record drawings of decorative panels at Montagu House, Bloomsbury, is annotated in Marot's hand (V&amp;A). They relate to five painted panels at Boughton, Northamptonshire, that originally lined a closet in the London house. These drawings were not subsequently published by Marot. One is inscribed &#145;la hauteur de la tapisserie de monsieur Loire est de 7 pied 6 pouce&#146; indicating that the panels were probably based on designs by Alexis Loir (1640&#150;1713), Parisian engraver and goldsmith. Similar drawings in the National Museum, Stockholm, correspond to Loir's <span class="italic">Nouveau desseins d'ornemens de paneaux, lambris, carosse etc</span>. As Loir is not recorded in England, Montagu may have imported the panels from France. Marot's contribution to the interior decoration at Montagu House was as co-ordinator of design although he may have directed operations from Holland. Decorative painting was bordered by architectural woodwork and matching picture frames. Although the house was demolished in the 1840s, surviving picture frames demonstrate that their design answers to Marot's later published designs for frames. The Montagu House frames may have been made from original drawings by Marot.<br>
<br>As at Montagu House, London, Daniel Marot's work at Petworth for the duke of Somerset is largely undocumented. Similar to the second Montagu House, Bloomsbury, said by Colen Campbell to be the work of &#145;Pouget&#146;, the exterior originally had a pronounced central squared dome (destroyed by fire in 1714). The interior&#151;in particular the marble hall realized during 1692, with its giant doorcases, huge bracketed frieze, and overmantels crowned by segmental pediments&#151;is similar to Daniel Marot's Tr&egrave;veszaal in the Binnenhof at The Hague, completed in 1698. The west front is similar to Marot's De Voorst, designed from 1697 for William III's favourite Arnold Joost van Keppel, first earl of Albemarle; the busts on fluted tapering plinths over the ground-floor windows of the pavilions are reminiscent of an overmantel there. The central section of the frieze is close to one of Marot's prints in his series <span class="italic">Trois diferentes corniches</span>. Marot's influence is present in the military trophies on the gates to the forecourt, a form of trophy which reappears in his published designs for triumphal arches.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1693 John Bowen the agent &#145;received of my Lord Duke twenty Pounds which was paid to Mr. Maro&#146;  (sixth duke of Somerset's personal receipt book, W. Sussex RO). Marot is also recorded as borrowing a book from the duke's library.<h2>
<a name="RoyalpatronageinEngland"></a>Royal patronage in England</h2>Probably inspired by the interior of Montagu House, William III entrusted the earl of Montagu with the supervision of his palace interiors. At some time in the early 1690s Daniel Marot became involved, indeed Marot later referred to himself as &#145;Architecte des appartments de sa Majest&eacute; Britanique&#146;. Correspondence from Constantijn Huygens dated April 1694 records that Marot had been sent for from Holland by Queen Mary. In October he was back in Amsterdam where he married Catherine Mary, daughter of Adrian Gole, but the registers note that Daniel was resident in London. His brother Isaac witnessed the marriage. Daniel, Catherine, and Isaac returned to London. The records of Queen Mary's privy purse document annual fees paid to Daniel Marot and specific payments to Daniel's younger brother, Isaac, in 1694 for &#145;designing and drawing 3 large pieces of silk during 3 weeks at 5s a day. For designing during 6 days some ornaments for a bed and cushions&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5751). Thus the series of eight embroidered panels in Queen Mary's closet, Hampton Court Palace, traditionally believed to have been designed by Daniel Marot for the queen, may have been the work of Isaac Marot&#151;they were probably not completed and therefore not hung until after Mary's death. It was Daniel who probably took overall responsibility for the decoration of Queen Mary's water gallery at Hampton Court, a suite of private apartments on two floors overlooking the River Thames, adjoining the privy garden. The <i>piano nobile</i> had a gallery and a great room with four closets at the corners; the lower floor housed a dairy and a bathing room. Celia Fiennes described the closets opening off the great room as &#145;panelled all with Jappan, another with Looking Glass and two with work under panells of glass&#146;  (C. Morris, ed., <span class="italic">The Travels of Celia Fiennes</span>, 1947, 59&#150;60). Could this &#145;work under glass&#146; be the hangings embroidered to Marot's designs which have now returned to Hampton Court? The upper floor was decorated in blue, white, and gold; the gallery furnished with four couches upholstered in sky-coloured satin, twenty-five cane chairs, and twelve round stools japanned blue and white. In addition two sets of tables, mirrors, and stands, decorated <i>en suite</i>, were supplied for the piers. One of these tables has been identified and carries the inscription &#145;La Galerie Thames&#146; on the underside of the stretcher (priv. coll.). The dairy was furnished with tiles (examples in the Rijksmuseum, and in the V&amp;A) and Delft milk pans (V&amp;A; Hampton Court Palace) made in Delft to Daniel Marot's designs. There were also urns, vases, and tall pyramids, made up of tiers of box-like units, each with a number of protruding nozzles. Usually referred to as tulip vases, they were probably used to grow hyacinths (see A. Pavord, <span class="italic">The Tulip</span>, 1999, 182). The delftware bears the &#145;AK&#146; monogram of Adrianszoon Koex (who ran the Greek A factory at Delft from 1687 to 1701) and the &#145;PAK&#146; monogram of his son Pieter Adrianszoon who ran the factory until his death in 1703, when it was managed by his widow until 1722. Marot also designed some features of the interiors for William III at Hampton Court&#151;a ceiling design in the collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects incorporating a royal crown is thought to be part of this commission&#151;but in the main palace Marot worked under the supervision of William Talman (1650&#150;1719).<br>
<br>Marot almost certainly designed interiors for Queen Mary at Kensington Palace. There the queen's bed was of seven-colour velvet, lined with gold satin and adorned with green and silver <i>passementerie</i>, with an embroidered gold satin counterpane. Her closet was hung with Indian damask and furnished with a blue and gold embroidered couch, with a tented canopy of gold and gauze curtains. These could be raised up and down with pulleys round a framework. The design of the latter may have been inspired by Turkish practice. Recent research has indicated that Daniel Marot was also responsible for the layout of the twelve-acre slope garden to the south of Kensington Palace from 1689 to 1690. A broad gravel walk centred on the south front of the palace was flanked by arrangements of grass and gravel forming &#145;parterres &agrave; l'Angloise&#146; with <i>plates bandes</i> and topiary. This formal garden was cleared in 1727.<br>
<br>Daniel Marot was based in London for at least two more years. In June 1695 his eldest son, Daniel, was baptized at the Huguenot church of Leicester Fields and his daughter Marianne was baptized there in June 1696. The family were still in London in December 1696 when Daniel's wife (then named as Catherina Maria van Goolen) witnessed the baptism of Abraham, son of her cousin the cabinet-maker Cornelius Gole, at the same church. By the autumn of the following year, Daniel, Catherine, and their two young children had returned to Holland; their second son was baptized in Amsterdam on 1 September 1697. How was Marot's time in England occupied for the two years that he is definitely recorded in England and in particular from January 1695, after the death of Queen Mary?<h2>
<a name="OtherEnglishcommissions"></a>Other English commissions</h2>Leading courtiers created in their own country palaces suites of apartments worthy of their monarch. They commissioned grand beds in imitation of those made for the royal palaces. Other furnishings also imitated royal decoration. Delftware believed to have been made to Daniel Marot's designs survives at Boughton and Drayton in Northamptonshire, Castle Howard, Yorkshire, Dyrham, Gloucestershire, and Petworth and Uppark in Sussex. One courtier, Thomas Coningsby (1656&#150;1729), appears to have commissioned the king's own designer to achieve the necessary effect. At Hampton Court, Herefordshire, the king's state bedroom was hung with the same crimson damask that was used to upholster the state bed and the accompanying set of seat furniture. The damask was identical to that used in William III's presence chamber at Hampton Court Palace. Woven in Genoa, it was provided by the London-based Huguenot merchant William Portal. The state bed (Het Loo Palace, Apeldoorn, Netherlands) with its flying tester has little cantoon wings at the end corners, a feature also found on the great crimson velvet bed from Melville House, Fife (V&amp;A), made for William III's former secretary of state for Scotland, George, earl of Melville. Melville House was designed from 1697 by the Scottish architect James Smith. Not satisfied with creating a bed for the king's use, Coningsby ordered for himself a four-poster bed upholstered in blue silk damask (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).<br>
<br>Both the Melville state bed and those from Hampton Court, Herefordshire, are attributed to the London-based Francis Lapiere, the leading French &eacute;migr&eacute; upholsterer of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, although no bills have survived to prove this. The attribution is based on a comparison with the remaining canopy, headboard, and cloth of a crimson damask state bed embellished with silver braid (Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire) originally made for William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire's seat at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, for which Lapiere charged &pound;497 in 1697. Another state bed, created about 1704, two years after William III's death, can be seen at Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire, the seat of William Blaythwayt, former secretary of war to that king. Upholstered in crimson and yellow velvet, and lined with a sprigged satin, it was created for the &#145;Best Bed Chamber above Stairs&#146; where the walls were lined with tapestry and the windows had matching yellow damask silk curtains and red and white striped case curtains. Even the doors had similar curtains and valances. The names Lapiere and Marot are directly associated with the provision of upholstered furnishings for Montagu House, London, and Boughton House, Northamptonshire. In 1705 Lapiere was paid &pound;6 0<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. for &#145;taking a crimson &amp; gold damask bed all to pieces &amp; new making it up again to go to Boughton&#146;  (MS, Boughton House), a reference to the Boughton state bed (V&amp;A). Lapiere also made new beds for Montagu and in 1706 supplied a bed of striped tapestry needlework and charged for &#145;Mr. Marrot&#146; for &#145;drawing the Cornishes and for drawing the Cupps&#146;  (MS, Boughton House). This rare reference to the designer is unexpected, as by 1697 Daniel Marot had returned to Holland. The most likely explanation is that this refers to Daniel's younger brother, Isaac, the &#145;dessinateur&#146; whose son Charles was baptized at the Huguenot chapel at the Savoy in September 1707.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>In England, it was Daniel Marot's skill as a designer which resulted in a unified approach to interior decoration. This was realized under his supervision through a team of other designers, artists, and craftsmen. The importance of Daniel Marot's younger brother, Isaac, as a designer has only recently emerged and as yet no drawings have been firmly attributed to him. But there were other designers working in a similar style. Mr Boujet signed drawings for the overmantel at Dunham Massey, Cheshire (drawings collection, RIBA), and a sculptured relief for a pediment (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). A series of elaborately carved walnut hall benches at Dunham Massey are Dutch in inspiration and, if not imported from Holland, may well have been designed by Marot, or another member of his circle. Many of those who worked with Marot in England were foreigners; some were Huguenot refugees from France, others came to England via Holland. Apart from the upholsterer Lapiere, they included the cabinet-makers Gerrit Jensen and Cornelius Gole, the carvers and gilders Jean, Thomas, and R&eacute;n&eacute; Pelletier, and the goldsmith Peter Archambo. Through his published designs, Daniel Marot's influence in England was long-lived, and inspired the work of later designers including the architect William Kent. Marot's published designs were reissued in 1892, and the resulting resurgence of interest produced a spate of articles and Marot revival interiors, of which the blue drawing-room at Stansted, Sussex, designed by Goodhart Rendel in 1926, is most remarkable in its close adherence to Marot's printed designs.<h2>
<a name="MarotsreturntoHolland"></a>Marot's return to Holland</h2>On his return to Holland, Daniel Marot worked for Arnold Joost van Keppel, first earl of Albemarle (1669&#150;1718), at De Voorst (destr.) near Zutphen. Here Marot supervised the interiors of a building designed by Jacob Roman and designed the garden layout. The drawing for the <i>trompe-l'&#339;il</i> staircase decoration (Cooper Hewitt Museum, New York) is signed by the decorative artist Isaac de Moucheron. This demonstrates how closely Daniel Marot worked with his team of artists and craftsmen.<br>
<br>Although Marot continued to receive annual payments from William III until 1701  (TNA: PRO t38/193, fol. 98), the king's death in 1702 led Marot to seek patronage from citizens of The Hague and Amsterdam. He lived in The Hague until 1704, then moved to Amsterdam and developed his career as an architect. There his clients included the stadholder of Friesland, John William Friso, for whom he created new state apartments and a staircase at Oranienstein Castle between 1707 and 1709.<br>
<br>From 1687 Marot issued series of printed designs in suites of about six sheets. The first collected edition consisting of 108 plates appeared in 1703; many of the prints proclaim Marot's former appointment as &#145;architecte de Guillaume III, Roy de Grande Bretagne&#146;. The second edition of 1712 consisted of 126 plates and was published in The Hague as <span class="italic">&#338;uvres de Sieur D. Marot</span>. His sets of designs included <span class="italic">Nouveaux livre da partements</span> (first published in The Hague in 1700&#150;01); <span class="italic">Second livre dappartements</span> (1702); <span class="italic">Nouveaux livres d'ornements</span> (before March 1702); <span class="italic">Second livre d'ornaments</span> (1702&#150;3); <span class="italic">Nouveaux livres de pintures de salles et d'escaliers</span>; <span class="italic">Nouveaux livre de tableaux de portes, et chemin&eacute;e utiles aux peintres enfleurs</span>; <span class="italic">Nouveaux livres de placfond</span>; <span class="italic">Nouvelles chimin&eacute;e de la Hollande</span> (before March 1702); <span class="italic">Nouveaux livre de bo&icirc;tes de pendulles de coqs et estuys de montres et autres nec&eacute;ssaire au orlogeurs</span> (1706); and <span class="italic">Nouveaux livre d'orf&egrave;vrerie</span> (before March 1702). The latter included designs for silver tables. Some of Marot's printed designs from the library of Ralph, first duke of Montagu (priv. coll.), bear contemporary annotations. They include his <span class="italic">Livres de statues propres a tailli&egrave;re en marbre</span> and <span class="italic">Vases de la maison royalle de Loo</span>&#151;some are similar to a set of four lead vases with relief decoration which survive at Boughton which were probably supplied by Thomas Pelletier in 1705. There are designs for gardens, coaches, embroidery, stage sets, and funerary monuments.<br>
<br>With the help of Isaac Marot and the Huguenot booksellers David and Pierre Mortier who maintained shops in both Amsterdam and London, Daniel Marot's designs were successfully marketed in Britain as well as in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and Austria. In England they were used by artists and craftsmen who had already worked to his drawings. They continued to inspire&#151;a set of seventeen painted panels incorporating the Montagu arms and garter star and ribbon (priv. coll.), which were painted for the second duke of Montagu after 1718, bear witness to their influence fifteen years after they were first published.<br>
<br>In Holland, Marot developed a second career as an architect. At The Hague, his patrons were government officials and members of the cultivated upper class. For Fran&ccedil;ois Fagel (1659&#150;1746), secretary of the states general, he rebuilt a house at Noordeinde in 1707. In 1715 for Cornelis van Schuylenburch (1683&#150;1763) Marot converted two town houses into one mansion&#151;here he applied typical Louis XIV interior ornament to exterior architecture. About 1717 Johan Hendrik van Wassenaer-Obdam (<i>d</i>. 1745), a member of the council of state, commissioned a house on the Kneuterdijk. In 1734&#150;6 Marot designed the interiors of a palatial residence for Adriana Margareta Huguetan (<i>d</i>. 1752) on the Lange Voorhout; the fa&ccedil;ade was the work of Jan Pieter van Baurscheit. One of his last important commissions was to extend the huis ten Bosch for William Charles Henry Friso of Orange Nassau (later Stadholder William IV). He added two wings and a new entrance hall in 1745&#150;7.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Marot continued to draw on late seventeenth-century French design for inspiration and it is surprising how little his style changed and developed. This must reflect conservative taste in Holland and the extended dominance of the Louis XIV style. Daniel Marot's eldest son, also Daniel (1695&#150;1769), assisted his father. His earliest drawing dates from 1716. He continued to paint decorations for garden pavilions after his father's death on 4 June 1752.<br>
