<span class="headword">Houghton,  Joseph Henry</span>  (1876&#150;1949), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at Northampton on 27 March 1876, the second son of Joseph Houghton, riveter, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trusler. By the age of fifteen he had followed his father into the shoe industry, working as a clicker in Northampton, and by 1901 he had moved to Scotland, where he was working as a clicker in Kilmarnock. He married, in Kilmarnock on 31 December 1902, Elizabeth Martha (1884/5&#150;1921), daughter of Henry Simcoe, manager in a boot factory.<br>
<br>Houghton worked in the leather industry in the manufacture of footwear and represented the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives as delegate to Glasgow Trades Council (GTC), and the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC). Houghton was to become a leading political activist within the council; he was elected to the parliamentary committee of the GTC in 1907 and to the trades disputes committee the following year. As an active trade unionist he argued continually for workers' rights. As an active socialist he tirelessly promoted any campaign which would challenge the conditions of poverty experienced by the working classes on Clydeside and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1910&#151;still representing the boot and shoe operatives&#151;Houghton denounced the &#145;scandalous sentences&#146; passed against the former dockers' organizer Jim Larkin, of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL). Larkin had been accused by James Sexton, leader of the NUDL, of attempting to defraud the union. Houghton testified to Larkin's honesty and integrity but he was nevertheless found guilty and imprisoned for twelve months. When shortly afterwards the Glasgow dockers finally decided to leave the NUDL, James Kessack approached the GTC for assistance in encouraging men &#145;back into the union&#146;, and in December 1910 a ten-man committee, which included Joseph Houghton, was set up to help reform Glasgow dockers. By January 1911, however, the Glasgow docks branch of the NUDL was closed down and within six months the men were reorganized into a new union, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers (SUDL). Houghton played a leading role in this development and in 1911 was elected general secretary of the SUDL.<br>
<br>During the labour unrest between 1910 and 1914 Houghton was to become closely associated with the London activists Tom Mann and Ben Tillett, the French syndicalist Madame Sorgue of the Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration G&eacute;n&eacute;rale du Travail, and Captain Edward Tupper of the seamen's union, as well as other socialist and industrial activists in Scotland, including Kessack and James Keir Hardie. By 1916 Houghton was a member of the parliamentary committee of the STUC and was office bearer on that committee between 1917 and 1919. He was the Clyde district secretary and executive council member to the National Transport Workers' Federation (NTWF) and a fervent supporter of the Triple Industrial Alliance. He served on several wartime governmental bodies, and in 1919 gave evidence on behalf of the Glasgow dockers to the transport workers' court of inquiry&#151;where he worked closely with Ernest Bevin. It was at this inquiry that he stated he was the only Englishman among the Scots and Irish who made up the dock labour force at Glasgow.<br>
<br>Houghton remained leader of the SUDL until the membership (reluctantly) transferred to the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1923. During that time he witnessed the membership of the SUDL double from 5000 to 10,000 and extended to cover other workers&#151;most notably female munitions workers at Nobel's chemical factory at Ardeer in Ayrshire. In 1923 Houghton became docks secretary of the TGWU in Scotland, a position he held until his retirement in 1941. During that time he remained active in Scotland and represented the TGWU at the Trades Union Congress. He was brought out of retirement briefly in 1942. Following the death of his first wife he married, in Glasgow on 14 November 1930, Elizabeth Mair (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), a laundrymaid, daughter of Archibald Mair, police constable. Latterly they lived at Carbeth, Blanefield, Stirlingshire. Houghton died at the Killearn Hospital on 9 June 1949.<br>
