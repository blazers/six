<span class="headword">Mikes,  George</span>  (1912&#150;1987), <span class="occ">writer and humorist</span>, was born Gy&ouml;rgy Mikes on 15 February 1912 in Sikl&oacute;s, Hungary, the son of Alfred Mikes, lawyer, and his wife, Margit, <i>n&eacute;e</i> G&aacute;l. During the First World War the family moved to P&eacute;cs, where Alfred Mikes worked in a military court; they returned to Sikl&oacute;s when Alfred was invalided out of the army, and he died when his son was ten. The Mikes family were non-practising Jews; aged seventeen, George became a Roman Catholic. After attending the Cistercian school in P&eacute;cs and the Mad&aacute;ch Gymnasium in Budapest, he studied law at the University of Budapest. There he dabbled in theatre criticism, and on graduation he worked for the Budapest newspaper <span class="italic">A Reggel</span> (<span class="italic">The Morning</span>), covering all subjects except politics and sport.<br>
<br>In 1938, following Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia, Mikes was sent to London to report on what he would later describe as the &#145;more and more deafening&#146; portents of war. The assignment was expected to last two weeks, but Mikes stayed for good; in his autobiography he remarked that &#145;Some fortnights are longer than others&#146;  (Mikes, 97). He continued to work for <span class="italic">A Reggel</span> until 1940, and from 1941 to 1951 was employed by the BBC's Hungarian-language service. At the BBC he met George Orwell, whom he introduced to Andr&eacute; Deutsch, another Hungarian, who was then working for the publisher Nicholson and Watson; Orwell twice offered <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span> to Deutsch, but no deal was forthcoming.<br>
<br>Mikes's first book, <span class="italic">The Epic of Lofoten</span>, about the experiences of Norwegian islanders overrun by the Nazis, appeared in 1941. It was published under the name &#145;Dr H. George Mikes&#146;&#151;an error resulting from his attempting to delete the title &#145;Dr&#146; from the proof pages. On 17 December 1941, at Marylebone register office, he married Isobel Estelle Cl&eacute;mence Gerson (1916/17&#150;1986), programme assistant at the BBC, and the daughter of Frank Gerson, shipping agent; one of the witnesses was the screenwriter Emeric Pressburger, a fellow Hungarian who had recently begun his collaboration with the film director Michael Powell. The marriage lasted exactly five years and the couple had a son, Martin (<i>b</i>. 1945).<br>
<br>In September 1947 George Mikes became a British subject. The previous year saw his first real literary success, with <span class="italic">How to be an Alien</span>, subtitled &#145;A Handbook for Beginners and More Advanced Pupils&#146;. The book was rejected by an editor at Nicholson and Watson, who is alleged to have said, &#145;A funny book about aliens, eh? I'm afraid you'd better try elsewhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Nov 1976). Mikes had more luck with Andr&eacute; Deutsch, who now had his own publishing company; it was Deutsch's idea for Nicolas Bentley to provide illustrations. Mikes divided his study into two parts: a survey of specific English personality types&#151;including the &#145;Bloomsbury Intellectual&#146; and the &#145;Mayfair Playboy&#146;&#151;preceded by a survey of &#145;How to be a general alien&#146; in which he considered subjects such as English understatement, mistrust of cleverness, and love of queuing, &#145;the natural passion of an otherwise dispassionate race&#146;  (p. 44). Mikes expected to inflame the reading public with his laconic assessment of British foibles. Among the book's more notable moments of pithiness was the observation that &#145;Continental people have a sex life; the English have hot-water bottles&#146;  (p. 36). But one-liners of this kind delighted an austerity-ridden Britain where laughs were in short supply, and Mikes's bank manager, who apparently threw the book in the fire, was a rare dissenting voice. The first printing of 5000 copies sold out in a week, and <span class="italic">How to be an Alien</span> went on to be published in seventeen languages.<br>
<br>Mikes would attempt to repeat the formula, with books about the French, Italians, Germans, Swiss, Israelis, Australians, and Japanese. None was as successful, though his capacity for epigram and for gentle but unsettling insight remained. On 2 January 1948, again at Marylebone register office, he married Lea Hanak (1921&#150;1986), a colleague at the BBC and the daughter of Martin Hanak, merchant. Together they had a daughter, Judith (<i>b</i>. 1949). In the 1950s, while maintaining a prolific literary output, Mikes began working for the BBC's <span class="italic">Panorama</span>, for which he covered the 1956 Hungarian revolution. That led to more sober publications: his <span class="italic">The Hungarian Revolution</span> (1957) was the first volume in English to document the event, and <span class="italic">A Study of Infamy</span> (1959) examined the operations of the Hungarian secret police. His first novel, <span class="italic">Mortal Passion</span> (1963), was less serious yet afforded a disturbing portrait of a man who could not stop eating. In 1970 Mikes returned to Hungary to make a documentary for the BBC. Incensed by the BBC team's filming the graves of people killed during the revolution, the Hungarian authorities demanded he leave the country. Nevertheless, he was able to return to Hungary in 1979.<br>
<br>Many of Mikes's later books were in a flippant vein. They included a collaboration with Ian Russell, thirteenth duke of Bedford, <span class="italic">How to Run a Stately Home</span> (1971), and the novel <span class="italic">The Spy Who Died of Boredom</span> (1973). He published in 1982 an autobiography, <span class="italic">How to be Seventy</span>, and in the following year a memoir of his long friendship with Arthur Koestler. Other friends included J. B. Priestley and the cartoonist Victor Weisz (Vicky). His social life revolved around the Garrick Club and the Hurlingham Club&#151;the latter enabling him to indulge his &#145;one and only mania&#146;, for tennis  (Mikes, 226)&#151;while his more public-spirited side was reflected in his being president of PEN in Exile from 1972 to 1980, as well as a governor of London Oratory School.<br>
<br>Mikes lived latterly at 1b Dorncliffe Road, Fulham, London, where he put up his own blue plaque, removed after his death. He died of pneumonia, a complication of leukaemia, on 30 August 1987, at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea. He was survived by his two children, Lea Mikes having died in October 1986.<br>
