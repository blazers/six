<span class="headword">Bryce,  (John) Annan</span>  (1843&#150;1923), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born in Belfast on 12 August 1843, the son of the mathematician and geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3799/', "James Bryce the younger (1806&#150;1877)")</script> and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Young (1813&#150;1903). His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32141/', "James Bryce, Viscount Bryce (1838&#150;1922)")</script>. Educated at Glasgow high school, he studied from 1858 at the University of Glasgow, graduating MA in 1866, and at the University of Edinburgh. He went on to Balliol College as Brackenbury history scholar, graduating BA in 1872, after serving as first the secretary, then treasurer, and in 1871 the president of the Oxford Union Society. He married Violet (<i>d</i>. 1939), daughter of Captain Champagn&eacute; L'Estrange RA. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1875 Bryce joined Wallace Brothers, East India merchants, and was sent to work as an assistant for the Bombay-based arm of the company, Wallace &amp; Co. The firm held leases of extensive teak forests in British and Upper Burma through its subsidiary, the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation, and in 1878 Bryce moved to Rangoon to assist in extending its activities. In 1880 he and a colleague, H. Maxwell, visited King Thibaw in Mandalay, and after prolonged negotiations they were able to confirm existing leases, and obtain new ones, to teak forests in Upper Burma. The following year Bryce travelled extensively in the Chindwin forests, identifying areas suitable for further expansion. In 1884 he visited upper Siam to explore opportunities for working the teak forests of that country, and his report was instrumental in Wallace Brothers' decision to open an office in Bangkok in 1886.<br>
<br>Bryce took an active part in the business life of Rangoon, serving as a chairman of the Rangoon chamber of commerce, and on the legislative council of Burma. In 1881 he was made a resident partner in the head office of Wallace &amp; Co. in Bombay, and in August 1884 he returned to London, on becoming a partner in the parent company, Wallace Brothers. Bryce's knowledge of Burmese and Siamese affairs proved invaluable to the London partners, and his analysis of the political situations at the royal courts in Mandalay and Bangkok was sent to British government officials in 1884, when the company lobbied for action to counter French moves to extend their commercial interests in the region.<br>
<br>It seems that Bryce was sent abroad only rarely after 1888, when he visited the Caucasus to investigate the state of the oil industry there, prior to Wallace Brothers' negotiation of contracts for the supply of refined kerosene. Maintaining his interest in travel and exploration, however, Bryce was a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society, 1886&#150;9, and frequently contributed to discussions at their meetings in the 1880s and 1890s. He also served as a member of the council of the London chamber of commerce, 1891&#150;1902.<br>
<br>Bryce retired from Wallace Brothers in 1906, on his election as the Liberal MP for the Inverness burghs. He represented the constituency until 1918, when he declined to seek re-election. Although his political career effectively ended, he remained active in business, and was a director of London, County, and Westminster Bank; the Bombay, Baroda, and Burma railway companies; the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank; and the Atlas Assurance Company. He was also chairman of British Westinghouse Company.<br>
<br>Possessing a strong interest in Irish affairs, Bryce served on the royal commission on congestion in Ireland, 1906&#150;8, and he spoke frequently in favour of home rule. In October 1920 he wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> from Glengariff, co. Cork, complaining of reprisals carried out against the local population by soldiers seeking revenge for republican attacks on troops and loyalists. Later that month, his wife, Violet, was arrested at Holyhead, <i>en route</i> for Tonypandy, where she had been invited to speak about reprisals. Violet Bryce was detained under the <span class="roman">Restoration of Order in Ireland Act</span>, on the grounds that she was in possession of documents (the notes for her speech and a copy of a cartoon from an English newspaper) which libelled the Royal Irish Constabulary. She was deported to Dublin and held in the bridewell for several hours, before being released without charge&#151;a situation Bryce deplored in a series of letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. The issues raised by his wife's arrest, and Bryce's denunciations of the increasing authoritarianism of British rule in some areas of Ireland, fuelled controversy in the press and in the House of Commons over the government's policy in Ireland.<br>
<br>Bryce died at his home, 35 Bryanston Square, London, on 25 June 1923, and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex. He had been an enthusiastic collector of art throughout his adult life, and his collection of oriental <i>objets d'art</i> was so highly regarded as to merit exhibition at the Imperial Institute in 1892. In November 1923 the contents of his home, consisting of 2200 lots, which included Italian masters, English furniture, and Persian rugs, were sold at auction.<br>
<br>To his contemporaries in the world of business, Bryce was probably best known for his services in opening up and protecting British interests in the teak forests of Burma and Siam. However, his support for Irish home rule and his outspoken criticism of British policy in Ireland after the First World War brought him a degree of wider fame, or notoriety, late in life.<br>
