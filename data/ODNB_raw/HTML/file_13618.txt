<span class="headword">Holt,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, was probably a member of the Holt family of Bury St Edmunds, though he does not appear in its heraldic pedigree of 1561. In his will he styled himself &#145;Master&#146;, suggesting that he had graduated from a university, but it is not known which. Although he may have been the &#145;Master Holte of London&#146; recorded in September 1526 as supplying money to Thomas Cromwell for works on Cardinal College, Oxford, the first certain reference to him comes from 15 June 1528, when as bishop of Lydda <i>in partibus</i> he laid the foundation stone of Cardinal Wolsey's projected college at Ipswich, as the stone itself, preserved in the chapter house of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, records. Holt's episcopal style is puzzling, for there was already a bishop of Lydda active in England, namely Thomas Bele, who was suffragan in the diocese of London from no later than September 1521 until at least 17 December 1529. And Bele's tenure of the &#145;diocese&#146; overlapped with that of Roger Smith, abbot of Dorchester, who was papally provided to it in 1513 and may have held it until his death <i>c</i>.1535. Probably neither popes nor bishops were particularly careful about the titles borne by English suffragans.<br>
<br>Holt was most likely employed as suffragan in East Anglia, as is suggested by his role at Ipswich and again by his performing ordinations at Norwich on 22 May 1535. His will, which he drew up on 11 August 1540, shows that he was then living in Bury and had property at Great Barton near by. Still styling himself bishop of Lydda, he made a traditional bequest of his soul to God, the Virgin, and the heavenly host, and requested burial in St Mary's parish church, Bury, &#145;in our Ladys Ile next unto the hedde of John Holt gent&#146;  (will). The latter, who must have been the John Holt whose memorial stone in that church records his death on 13 July 1539 and his interment in its south chancel aisle, is the only man of that surname referred to in the will. Bishop Holt's most substantial bequests, including his property in Great Barton, were to two servants. He also left money to three parish guilds, and disposed of chimere, mitre, and rochets, largely to pay for his funeral and for a distribution of alms to the poor. He had died at Bury St Edmunds by 19 August, when his will was proved.<br>
