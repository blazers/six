<span class="headword">Page,  David</span>  (1814&#150;1879), <span class="occ">geologist and author</span>, was born on 24 August 1814 at Plantation Street, Lochgelly, Fife, the son of a mason, builder, and contractor. Educated at the parish school, he entered the University of St Andrews in 1828 to study for the ministry in the Church of Scotland. He pursued a literary career upon leaving St Andrews in 1834, although he remained a lifelong adherent of the moderate party in the church. He lectured, edited, and wrote for the newspapers, publishing a geological essay on Fife and Kinross in 1834 and a volume of poems in 1838. His switch of allegiance from the liberal whig <span class="italic">Fife Herald</span> to the tory <span class="italic">Fifeshire Journal</span> led to Page's being known as the &#145;Judas&#146; editor and &#145;a literary prostitute&#146;  (Campbell, chap. 6). In 1843, on 16 October, he married Annzella Maria Wetier, daughter of Thomas Snooks, a captain in the Fifeshire militia.<br>
<br>From 1843 until 1851 the Edinburgh publisher W. and R. Chambers employed Page to contribute to its ambitious programme of popular education. The anonymous <span class="italic">Rudiments of Geology</span> (1844) was the first of Page's hugely successful series of geological primers. In the course of his work for the firm, he was told the great secret of Robert Chambers' authorship of the anonymous <span class="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> (1844), and he corrected scientific mistakes in early editions of this evolutionary best-seller. Page was willing to consider creation through secondary causes, as long as this was subsidiary to the divine plan. Enraged by &#145;the moral cowardice that shrinks from avowing its paternity&#146;  (Page, 209), he exposed Chambers as the <span class="italic">Vestiges</span> author in 1854, although many continued to attribute the work to others.<br>
<br>By this time Page had left his position after a bitter disagreement about terms of employment. He returned to journalism and rewrote his textbooks, which henceforth appeared under his own name as <span class="italic">Introductory Text-Book of Geology</span> (1854, 11th edn, 1877) and <span class="italic">Advanced Text-Book of Geology</span> (1856, 5th edn, 1872). From the late 1850s a torrent of geological titles appeared from his pen, usually brief and often repetitive: among the most important were a <span class="italic">Handbook of Geological Terms</span> (2nd edn, 1865); <span class="italic">The Earth's Crust</span> (1864, 6th edn, 1872); and <span class="italic">Geology for General Readers</span> (1866, 12th edn, 1888). His books on physical geography were equally successful.<br>
<br>Although Page presented over a dozen research papers to scientific societies, his reputation as a prolific writer led to accusations of book-making. As the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> (12 June 1869, 801) said in reviewing <span class="italic">Chips and Chapters</span>, &#145;It is the business of working geologists to make Chips, as it seems to be that of Dr. Page to make Chapters&#146;. Readers, however, appreciated Page's flair for clarity and logical organization, and his writings introduced a generation to the fundamentals of a rapidly developing and controversial science. He also became a popular lecturer, and in 1871 moved from Edinburgh to Newcastle upon Tyne to take up an appointment as professor of geology and mineralogy at the Durham University College of Physical Science.<br>
<br>Page had two sons and a daughter. He died on 9 March 1879 at his home, 6 Pleasant Row, Newcastle, from a paralysis which had been in progress for several years. His widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in 1890.<br>
