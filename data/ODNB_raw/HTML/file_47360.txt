<span class="headword">Halliday,  Thomas</span>  (1835&#150;1919), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 18 July 1835 at Prestolee near Bolton in Lancashire, the son of a coalminer who was killed in an accident when Thomas was only two years of age. His mother, who had been born in Wales, worked in a textile mill following her husband's death.<br>
<br>Halliday's working life started at the age of eight, and he toiled in the coal industry in various parts of the north of England until August 1863, when he became the full-time agent of the newly created Farnworth and District Miners' Union. Together with William Pickard from Ince in Lancashire, Halliday struggled to build up support for mining unionism in the Lancashire coalfield. Trade unionism in the Lancashire coalfield had briefly flourished in the 1840s, when the systematic use of localized strike action supported by neighbouring union branches had led to some improvements in wages and conditions. But the later years of that decade saw unionism decline, and revival was delayed by bitter local rivalries and the absence of solidarity engendered by the social and geographical exclusivity of mining communities in other coalfields. In Lancashire miners tended to live among workers in other trades, and were more vulnerable to the importation of migrant, especially Irish and Welsh, labour.<br>
<br>The two men became leading figures in the Miners' National Association, with Pickard as treasurer and Halliday as vice-president. This organization was dominated by the strategy and personality of its president, Alexander Macdonald, who tended to favour redress of grievances and improvement of conditions through parliamentary action, conciliation, and collaboration with employers. It was a policy which was not without its critics who advocated a more confrontational strategy, and in 1864 this led to schism in the ranks of mining trade unionism when critics of Macdonald withdrew from the national association and established the Practical Miners' Association which pursued a more aggressive industrial policy. This breakaway organization collapsed within two years, and during these disputes Pickard and Halliday remained loyal to Macdonald. The Miners' National Association was, in effect, a loose confederation of local unions which provided Macdonald with a platform from which to lobby parliament and the government for reforms in the conditions of employment in the coal industry. Halliday was among those who felt the need for an organization which could also co-ordinate industrial action, offer financial aid to members in disputes with employers, and organize sympathetic action if necessary.<br>
<br>Although relations with Macdonald never deteriorated into deep personal hostility, Halliday led a new challenge to Macdonald's supremacy within mining trade unionism in the late 1860s. It was the difficulties encountered by Halliday in trying to organize the miners of Lancashire, where the systematic use of strike-breakers, and female and child labour, made effective trade unionism very difficult, that convinced him that only a genuinely amalgamated national union of coalminers would result in significant improvement in wages and conditions. By July 1869 Halliday and Pickard had created the Amalgamated Association of Miners. Macdonald addressed a conference called to discuss the proposed new body; differences over strategy, however, prevented him from supporting the new organization which was formally launched the following month, with Halliday as its president.<br>
<br>Although the Amalgamated Association soon attracted support in Lancashire and some other parts of England, it was in the rapidly expanding but largely un-unionized coalfield of south Wales that the amalgamated miners' union was to have its greatest impact and leave a profound legacy. Until 1870 there had been only sporadic and spontaneous forms of organization among the colliers of south Wales, with no permanent coalfield-wide or even district bodies to co-ordinate activities. Halliday and his amalgamated union provided the catalyst for the creation of effective trade union organization in the south Wales coalfield. Under the amalgamated union a structure emerged, based on lodges organized into district committees, each with its own full-time agent, which was to characterize south Wales mining trade unionism for sixty years. Halliday enjoyed considerable initial success, with two large and successful disputes in 1871 and 1873. With a weakening market for coal, and concerted action by the coal owners, however, the period after 1874 was one of rapid decline for the Amalgamated Association. A strike early in 1875 against major wage reductions in the south Wales coalfield bankrupted Halliday's union, and it never recovered from the effects of this dispute. There was also growing hostility to the lack of rank-and-file control over the executive of the Amalgamated Association, which led to a series of secessions by district miners' associations. In south Wales, the 1875 strike resulted in the creation of a sliding scale for wages administered by a conciliation board, and subsequently coalmining trade unionism in south Wales, where it existed, operated on a highly sectionalized, valley-based, district system until the creation of the South Wales Miners' Federation in 1898. Attempts in 1877 by Halliday to revive the Amalgamated Association failed. Halliday served briefly as the secretary of a reunited Miners' National Association, but by the late 1870s Halliday's career as a national leader of the miners was over and he slipped into an obscurity from which he never re-emerged.<br>
<br>Halliday left no written records, and details of his personality and private life are very sparse. It is not known whether he was married. He must have possessed inspirational qualities; he certainly had a profound impact on rising miners' leaders in south Wales such as William Abraham (Mabon). It is a reflection of the dramatic impact he had on many Welsh miners, that Halliday was put forward as a Liberal candidate for Merthyr Tudful in the general election of 1874. He gained nearly 5000 votes, but proved unable to break the hold of the sitting members for that overwhelmingly working-class borough.<br>
<br>For Halliday the Merthyr Tudful election was the high-water mark of his career. From 1880 he disappears from the annals of the British labour movement, thereafter he seems to have eked out an existence as a small businessman trading in the accessories of employment in the coal industry of south Wales. Halliday died in Cardiff on 24 November 1919.<br>
