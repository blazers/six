<span class="headword">Paton,  Catherine  Forrester-</span>  (1855&#150;1914), <span class="occ">philanthropist and a founder of women's missionary training in Scotland</span>, was born on 1 June 1855 at Claremont Bank, Alloa; she was the second child and only daughter of Alexander Forrester (1823&#150;1883), merchant and woollen manufacturer, and his wife, Mary (1813&#150;1881), youngest daughter of John Paton of Kilncraigs, Alloa, founder of the woollen manufacturing business of John Paton &amp; Son, and his wife, Catherine Kirk. Her father, by then partner and accountant in the family firm, assumed the name Paton in 1860. Her formal education, at Alloa Academy and then at Grange House School, Edinburgh, finished when she was fifteen, and she returned home to help ageing parents. Sharing their evangelical outlook and devotion to the United Presbyterian church she gained experience of social problems at home and knowledge of foreign mission work, and she learned to handle business affairs&#151;it was said she had the efficiency of a commercial businessman. Following the deaths of her parents she inherited a considerable fortune. Unable because of uncertain health to fulfil her dream of becoming a missionary, she devoted herself to service for others.<br>
<br>The women's temperance movement was for Catherine a lifelong cause; from 1876, when the Alloa branch of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA) was formed and she, aged twenty-one, became secretary, to her death in 1914 she played an influential part, both locally and nationally. From 1906 she was president of the BWTA Scottish Christian Union. Her work for temperance was indicative of the growing independent activity by women for women in social, health, educational, and political fields.<br>
<br>In Alloa, besides the usual temperance meetings&#151;the prayer meetings were for her the powerhouse of the work&#151;she organized practical courses in cookery, laundry, and nursing of the sick, soup kitchens for the unemployed, and a centre for young people; she also ran refreshment tents at the local and national agricultural shows. Through the branch she started a district nursing service, one of the earliest in Scotland, which, with its emphasis on health education, became a model. Her interest in nursing and the needs uncovered by the district nursing service led her in 1899 to build and present to the people of Clackmannanshire, at a cost of over &pound;10,000, the well-equipped County Accidents Hospital.<br>
<br>A natural affinity with young people led Catherine to help to found, about 1880, a YWCA branch, which met in her home, as did a Sunday afternoon class. Shortly before her death she planned an institute with meeting-rooms and tea-room for the benefit of the townspeople, especially the young women. Throughout her life she continued church work, becoming well known nationally as a speaker at church and temperance meetings.<br>
<br>Her long-standing interest in foreign missions coincided with a growing demand for trained women for work among women abroad and at home&#151;piety and good intentions were no longer enough&#151;but there was in Scotland as yet no specific training. In 1891 she set up her own undenominational home, the Lady Missionaries' Training Home in Glasgow. Her courses were practical, equipping students with domestic, business, and nursing skills as well as biblical training and basic knowledge of the countries where they would work. The women came from Europe and America as well as from the British Isles. She knew them personally and continued to keep in touch by prodigious correspondence as well as by welcoming them to her home when they came on furlough. When the home closed, at Catherine's death, 220 women had passed through.<br>
<br>Catherine's portrait suggests the strength of character and serenity, based on her strong evangelical faith, that enabled her to accomplish so much. Cultured, widely read, and musical, she was also greatly loved and gentle, while formidable in her imaginative vision and practical abilities; bequests of over &pound;53,000, from her estate of &pound;117,855, reveal the breadth of her interests. Though not involved in the &#145;women's movement&#146; she was still a leader; unusually, at her funeral, among the cord-holders customary at a Scottish graveside were two women. She died on 8 August 1914 at Grantown-on-Spey, where she had gone to convalesce from pleurisy. She was buried beside her parents in Greenside cemetery, Alloa, on 12 August.<br>
