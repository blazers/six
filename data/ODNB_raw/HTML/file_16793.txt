<span class="headword">Liverseege,  Henry</span>  (1803&#150;1832), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 4 September 1803 at Manchester, where his father was employed in a cotton mill; he had at least one sister. Neglected by his father, he owed his early education to his uncle, Mr Green, a wealthy mill owner who encouraged him to pursue the profession of artist, for which he showed an early inclination at school. He was initially self-taught, copying in order to learn. His earliest attempts at painting were in portraiture, for which he received instruction from Mr Knowles; these included miniatures, silhouettes, and inn signs, but he soon devoted himself to genre painting including subjects from works by Sir Walter Scott, Shakespeare, and Cervantes. He also excelled as an amateur actor. Liverseege exhibited three small pictures of &#145;Banditti&#146; at the Royal Manchester Institution in 1827 which attracted attention, and at the end of that year he went to London to study at the British Museum, and also to copy the works of old masters at the British Institution. He visited Thomas Lawrence's collection of paintings and Lawrence offered him an introductory letter to the Royal Academy. Through some informality in his application he failed to gain admission and returned to Manchester in 1828 where he resumed portrait painting. He visited London again in 1829, but in 1830 returned to Manchester, where his mother died early the next year. He paid one more visit to London, where the duke of Devonshire purchased his <span class="italic">Sir Piercie Shafton and Mysie Happer</span> (exh. RA, 1831; Chatsworth, Derbyshire). In four years he exhibited eighteen works in London, between the Royal Academy, British Institution, and Suffolk Street. He also showed works in exhibition at Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, and Norwich.<br>
<br>Liverseege was considered to be a painter of some promise. His <span class="italic">The Recruit</span> (exh. RA, 1832; Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester) shows the influence, in both subject and treatment, of works by Sir David Wilkie. His works were published in mezzotint in twelve parts under the title <span class="italic">Recollections of Liverseege</span> (1832&#150;5) and a set of thirty-five mezzotint engravings from his pictures was published in 1875, with a portrait engraved from a painting by his friend William Bradley. Many of his works are now in Manchester City Galleries.<br>
<br>Liverseege suffered throughout his life from a collapsed lung and as a result was often tired and melancholic. After he returned to Manchester in 1831 his health broke down completely, and he died of a lung disease on 13 January 1832; he was buried on 19 January in St Luke's churchyard, Manchester. He was unmarried. Liverseege was 5 feet tall, slightly built, with deformed shoulders and a pale complexion.<br>
