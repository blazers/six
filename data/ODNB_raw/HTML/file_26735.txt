<span class="headword">Stubbes <span class="st"> [Stubbs]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1605/6&#150;1678), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was the son of Henry Stubbes of Bitton, Gloucestershire. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 16 April 1624, aged eighteen, graduated BA on 27 January 1628, and proceeded MA in June or July 1630. Within eighteen months he became rector of Partney, Lincolnshire; about this time he married Mary Purefoy, but it is not clear whether this was before or after the birth of their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26734/', "Henry Stubbe (1632&#150;1676)")</script>, at Partney on 28 February 1632. &#145;Being anabaptistically inclined&#146;, according to Anthony Wood, Stubbes was later compelled to leave his rectory; taking his family to Ireland, he found employment as a &#145;beadle of the beggars&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1067).<br>
<br>The Irish rising of 1641 induced Mistress Stubbes, and presumably within a short time Stubbes himself, to return to England. His movements over the next few years are unknown, but by July 1647 he was vicar of St Philip and St Jacob, Bristol, and in 1648 he signed the <span class="italic">Testimony</span> of the Somerset ministers. He then became vicar of Chew Magna in that county. By September 1652 he was one of the ministers of St Cuthbert, Wells, where in 1654 he assisted the commission of triers and ejectors in the work of regulating the ministry. He lectured at St Philip, Bristol, every month in 1658.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Stubbes was still at St Cuthbert, Wells, but he left when the sequestered minister was restored and served as assistant minister to Joseph Woodward at Dursley, Gloucestershire, until August 1662, when he was again ejected. On 20 November the presbyterian but conformist MP John Birch sympathetically promised Stubbes a &pound;5 a year allowance while he remained in need. Over the next decade he appeared throughout London, establishing his reputation as a learned and energetic preacher, but he retained links with the west country: in 1669 he preached in five Wiltshire parishes, including Chippenham, and at Winsham, Somerset. Fellow ministers who later celebrated his life reminded his congregations that &#145;We have often known him to continue five or six hours together in Preaching, chiefly in prayer on fasting-days&#146;, and that he had accomplished this &#145;without impertinencies, tautologies, tedious repetitions, or any crude, raw, rude, and nauseating expressions&#146;  (Vincent and others, 6). Richard Baxter, who recorded meeting him on 13 May 1671, noted his unusually charitable attitude towards other ministers. On 2 April 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian minister at his house in Jewin Street, London, but in or before 1675 he left the city. His farewell sermon to his congregation, published as <span class="italic">A Disswasive from Conformity to the World, as also God's Severity Against Impenitent Sinners</span> (1675), was a call to repentance and holy living in the mode of many contemporary devotional works.<br>
<br>Stubbes's last charge was in Gloucestershire. John Prichett, who had been consecrated bishop of Gloucester in November 1672, awarded Stubbes the long-vacant vicarage of Horsley, not far from Dursley, at a salary of &pound;8 a year. Here he &#145;preached for some years &hellip; in peace&#146; and &#145;used part of the Liturgy&#146;  (Baxter, 27), despite the criticism of some who thought this an unacceptable compromise. His <span class="italic">Conscience the Best Friend upon Earth</span> (1677) bears out his fellow ministers' emphasis on his &#145;constant secret Devotions, his dayly prayers with his Wife, and in his Family&#146;  (Vincent and others, 5) and his careful catechizing, and Baxter's observations on his peaceableness and humility: &#145;His studies, and parts, and labours lay not in the Critical or Controversial way&#146; and he did not make &#145;himself of a sect or faction, nor Preacht for this party against that, except for Christ's party against the Devils&#146;  (Baxter, 25&#150;6).<br>
<br>While on a preaching visit to London in the summer of 1678 Stubbes was taken ill with fever and dysentery. He died on 7 July and was buried at Bunhill; two funeral sermons were delivered, one on a Sunday by Thomas Watson, the other on a weekday by Richard Baxter. His will, drawn up on 31 May and proved on 5 September, was sprinkled with biblical references and contained prayers for his kin, congregation, fellow ministers, and country. He left property at Dundry, Somerset, and Uley, Gloucestershire, and money to the poor of several Gloucestershire parishes for books and teaching poor children to read. He was survived by his second wife, Dorothy, three sons (Robert, Samuel, and John), and a daughter (Dorothy); his eldest son and namesake had drowned two years earlier.<br>
