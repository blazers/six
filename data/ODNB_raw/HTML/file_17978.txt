<span class="headword">Manning,  Thomas</span>  (1772&#150;1840), <span class="occ">traveller and writer on China</span>, born at Broome, Norfolk, on 8 November 1772, was the second son of the Revd William Manning, successively rector of Broome and Diss, who died at Diss on 29 November 1810, aged seventy-seven, and his wife, Elizabeth, the only child of the Revd William Adams, rector of Rollesby, Norfolk, who died at Diss on 28 January 1782, aged thirty-four. Because of ill health, Thomas was educated at home as a boy, and in 1790 matriculated as a scholar at Caius College, Cambridge, where he spent the following five years studying mathematics. However, having adopted the plain dress of the Quakers, and sharing their antipathy to oaths and tests, he did not take a degree. He stayed for some years at Cambridge, studying medicine, teaching mathematics privately, and publishing his <span class="italic">Introduction to Arithmetic and Algebra</span> (2 vols., 1796&#150;8) and other works on mathematics. He also met Charles Lamb there in 1799. Lamb described Manning as his friend &#145;M., who with great painstaking got me to think I understood the first proposition in Euclid, but gave me over in despair at the second&#146;  (&#145;The old and new schoolmaster&#146;, <span class="italic">Elia: Essays</span>).<br>
<br>While at Cambridge, Manning became interested in the language and people of China, and in 1802 he went to Paris to study Chinese under Dr Hagar at the Bibloth&egrave;que Nationale. There he became friendly with several scientists, and especially the elder Carnot, with whom he corresponded regularly on the subject of algebra. When war broke out between France and England in 1803 Carnot and Talleyrand are said to have persuaded Napoleon to allow Manning to return to England, which he did in 1805.<br>
<br>Manning decided to go to Canton (Guangzhou) to perfect his Chinese, and in May 1806 obtained permission from the court of directors of the East India Company to travel there and live in the English factory as a doctor, having spent the previous six months gaining practical medical experience, mainly at Westminster Hospital, to complement his theoretical knowledge of the subject. In May 1806 he left England, and later that year arrived at Parijong. He made several unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the interior of China and, with the exception of a visit to Cochin China in February 1808, stayed at Canton until 1810. Early that year he went to Calcutta, where for a few months, with his flowing beard, eccentric dress and manner, and witty conversation, he was the centre of society. Then, without government permission, with one Chinese servant, he set off to Rangpur heading for Lhasa. He entered Bhutan by the Lakhi Duar in September 1811 and reached Parijong on the frontier of Tibet on 20 October. There he found a Chinese general, some of whose troops he cured of illness, and in their company he travelled as a doctor to Lhasa, where he arrived in December 1811, the first and for many years the only British traveller to reach the holy city. Ignoring the fact that he had been refused permission, he rode up to the <i>potala</i> (the Dalai Lama's palace), heavily but ineffectually disguised. Surprisingly he was permitted to stay for five months and was even granted an audience with the Dalai Lama, then a boy of seven. Manning was far from overawed by Lhasa. &#145;If the palace exceeded my expectations, the town as far fell short of them&#146;, he wrote.<blockquote>There is nothing striking, nothing pleasing in its appearance. The habitations are begrimed with smut and dirt. The avenues are full of dogs &hellip; growling and gnawing bits of hide which lie about in profusion and emit a charnel-house smell. (Hanbury-Tenison, 1995, 49)</blockquote>Under peremptory orders from Peking, Manning was sent back to India; he left Lhasa on 19 April 1812 and arrived at Calcutta the following summer. His original narrative of the journey was lost, and he refused to give any details to officials at Calcutta, so nothing more was known of this remarkable visit to one of the most politically sensitive and tantalizing areas of the world until his journal was edited by Clements Markham and published in 1879 as <span class="italic">Narrative of the mission of George Bogle to Tibet and of the journey of Thomas Manning to Lhasa</span>, with an introductory memoir.<br>
<br>Manning returned to Canton to live in the factory. In 1816 he accompanied Lord Amherst's embassy to Peking as junior secretary and interpreter, despite Amherst's initial objection to his flowing beard as &#145;incongruous&#146; in a British embassy. When the embassy was over, he set off for home in the <i>Alceste</i>, but the ship was wrecked near Sunda on 17 February 1817. Continuing homeward in the <i>Caesar</i>, in July 1817 he reached St Helena, where he met Napoleon. He returned to England, left again in 1827 to live in Italy until 1829, and thereafter lived in strict retirement, first at Bexley, Kent, and afterwards at a cottage called Orange Grove, near Dartford. The house was never furnished and Manning lived in a library of Chinese books said to be the most extensive in Europe at the time, and which he later bequeathed to the Royal Asiatic Society. He had a stream of visitors attracted by his scholarship and conversation. In 1838 a stroke disabled his right hand, and to secure better medical attention he moved to Bath, but before leaving his cottage he is said to have plucked out the whole of his beard by the roots, although this and other of his eccentricities may be simply the product of his habitually humorous tone, especially in his letters to Lamb. He died at Bath of apoplexy on 2 May 1840 and was buried in the abbey church there on 8 May.<br>
<br>Manning's scientific and mathematical work is now judged of little importance. For many years he was best remembered for his friendship with Lamb. Manning's were the only letters which Lamb did not destroy, and both they and Lamb's letters to Manning were published. The letters show the two men to have been good friends, but Manning's are remarkably uninformative about the places he visited. His journey to Lhasa has recently been the focus of more interest, although he himself regarded it simply as a necessary stage on his route into China.<br>
