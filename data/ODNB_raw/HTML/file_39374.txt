<span class="headword">Smith,  Edward Tyrrel</span>  (1804&#150;1877), <span class="occ">impresario and showman</span>, was born on 26 August 1804, the son of Admiral Edward Tyrrel Smith (<i>d</i>. 1824). Intended to follow his father's profession, he was appointed a midshipman in Lord Cochrane's ship, but at the last minute was fetched back from Chatham at his mother's insistence. He then joined the Metropolitan Police, as a red-waistcoated Bow Street runner, but subsequently became an auctioneer, restaurateur, licensed victualler, music-hall and theatre manager, land agent, picture dealer, bill discounter, and newspaper proprietor. It was rightly said of him that he was everything by turns, but nothing for long.<br>
<br>As a speculator, Smith turned Crockford's gaming house in St James's Street into a first-class restaurant which he called the Wellington. This venture fell through, however, and eventually it became the Devonshire Club. Smith then acquired an interest in Vauxhall Gardens, during their notorious days of decline. In 1849 he became the proprietor of several taverns, including the Coal Hole, in the Strand, where the tragedian Edmund Kean formed his Wolf Club. When the American Mrs Amelia Bloomer gave the world a new garment, he made the barmaids of his tavern wear it.<br>
<br>Smith's connection with theatres began in 1850, when he took the Marylebone, in Edgware Road, which he held for two years. At the end of 1852 he became lessee of Drury Lane, at a rental of &pound;3500. This theatre was in poor condition and had been on the market for some time, with the ground lessee even having considered demolishing it, but Smith kept it going for a full decade. He opened with <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span>, based on Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, and the pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Hudibras</span>, later mixing opera with Shakespeare, variety, and circus entertainment. Smith introduced morning performances there, and claimed thus to have invented the matin&eacute;e. In 1855 he became the proprietor of Hernandez and Stone's circus, and E. T. Smith's Leviathan Company, as it was known, toured the provinces, with Eaton Stone as manager.<br>
<br>In 1858 Smith acquired the Royal Panopticon in Leicester Square, which he reopened on 7 February as the Alhambra, with the <i>Cirque imperial</i>, starring one of the Berri brothers and James Leach, rivals of Jules Leotard on the trapeze. The company was then sent tenting on a provincial tour. Smith next took over Her Majesty's Theatre in the Haymarket, opening in 1860 with Sims Reave in opera and that Christmas producing <span class="italic">Tom Thumb</span>, the first pantomime to be staged there. It is said that he lost &pound;21,000 in the first year. Nevertheless, Smith was able to lease Cremorne Gardens from 1861 to 1869, meanwhile becoming lessee of Astley's Theatre (1863&#150;4) and of the Royal Lyceum (1867&#150;9). He introduced the sensational Adah Isaacs Menken at Astley's as Mazeppa on 3 October 1864, for a season of ten weeks. Smith worked her engagement for all it was worth, at one point advertising her as &#145;the saucy wench in tights&#146;  (W. Mankonitz, <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span>, 1982, 142).<br>
<br>Smith ran the Surrey Theatre for a short season from October 1870, Highbury Barn Gardens, with the associated Alexandra Theatre, from 1871, and not long afterwards the Regent Music-Hall, Westminster. At the sale of any place of entertainment Smith would make the highest bid, flourish a &pound;1000 note to demonstrate his means, and trust to luck to raise the funds afterwards. It was said he hired his &pound;1000 note from a moneylender, for &pound;1 per day. His friends believed that it was spurious. One of them, at a luncheon, produced a genuine &pound;1000 note. Smith took it, rolled it into a ball, dropped it into his soup, and swallowed it.<br>
<br>Smith then turned his attention again to restaurant catering and opened the Cremorne Supper Rooms in Leicester Square, and the Radnor on the corner of Chancery Lane, as well as a dining hall under the vaults of the Royal Exchange which was a conspicuous failure. He owned the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> from 1856 to 1858, and he also started another newspaper, the <span class="italic">Bedfordshire Independent</span>, but he soon gave up both of these business ventures. He stood for parliament in Bedford in March 1857 but was soundly beaten by a brewer.<br>
<br>Smith was a most wonderful and indefatigable impresario, a kind of English Barnum. He certainly made many friends, who seemed always ready to assist him in his various speculations. Although these were not always successful, his friendships were lasting and his faith and honesty were never doubted. He was a noted character in his day, who liked to see his name in print, and a generous supporter of charities; a great many of his acts were motivated by genuine kindness. He was also a jocular sort of fellow, always ready for a lark.<br>
<br>Smith married late in life and left behind a large family. He died on 26 November 1877 at his home, Oval House, Kennington Park, London, an old man, forgotten and in near poverty; his wife, Isabel, survived him. He was buried in Brompton cemetery on 1 December 1877. Despite the great numbers of people he had helped, there were barely half a dozen at his funeral.<br>
