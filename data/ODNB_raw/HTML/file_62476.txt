<div class="para">
<span class="headword">St Leger,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1731, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">army officer and racing enthusiast</span>, was baptized in February 1731, presumably at or near Grangemellon, co. Kildare, the fourth of five sons of Sir John St Leger (<i>d</i>. 1743) of Grangemellon, twenty-eight years a baron (or judge) of the Irish exchequer, and his second wife, Levinia, daughter of Kingsmill Pennefather of Cashel, co. Tipperary; Arthur St Leger, first Viscount Doneraile, was his uncle. Educated at Eton College between 1745 and 1748, St Leger entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1750 but left without taking a degree. On 21 August 1754 he was gazetted sub-lieutenant in the 2nd troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, before transferring to the 3rd King's Own dragoons as a captain-lieutenant on 25 December 1755. On 5 May 1756, as a captain, St Leger took command of the regiment's newly raised troop of light dragoons. The British army's light dragoons, which placed a premium on horsemanship, were rapidly established as an &eacute;lite force by their actions during the Seven Years' War, and in June and August 1758 nine troops, drawn from nine different cavalry regiments and including St Leger's, took part in combined operations against the French coast at St Malo and Cherbourg. When in 1760 John Manners, marquess of Granby, offered to raise a new regiment of &#145;light armed cavalry&#146; called the Royal Foresters, St Leger was selected by him as one of three field officers, each of whom was recommended as &#145;being such as are well affected to His Majesty, and are most likely by their interest and connections to assist in raising the said corps&#146;  (TNA:PRO, WO 4/60, 434&#150;5). The new regiment was taken onto the establishment as the 21st light dragoons, St Leger being gazetted major on 5 April. A number of his old command transferred to the 21st light dragoons alongside him.<br>
<br>The Royal Foresters never saw action and on 13 February 1762 St Leger took the opportunity to secure further advancement by becoming lieutenant-colonel of the 124th regiment of foot. When, with the ending of the Seven Years' War the following year, this regiment was disbanded, St Leger retired to civilian life with his new wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1776), daughter and coheir of William Wombwell of Wombwell, Yorkshire, whom he had married in October 1761. In 1765 he purchased the estate of Park Hill at Firbeck in the West Riding of Yorkshire. St Leger now entered politics and, with the marquess of Granby's support, was returned unopposed to parliament in 1768 for the borough of Great Grimsby. He sat for six years and although he was never reported as having spoken in the House of Commons, he voted throughout for the opposition. The one exception was on 8 May 1769 during the debate over the Middlesex election when, in an echo of the notoriously indecisive conduct of his patron Granby on this issue, he voted for the government.<br>
<br>St Leger's chief claim to fame, however, is as a racing enthusiast; his Park Hill estate even had its own racecourse. In 1776 he had the idea of a 25 guinea sweepstake for three-year-old horses run over 2 miles. The inaugural race, held on Cantley Common outside Doncaster, was won by a horse owned by the great whig magnate Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham. Two years later, on the eve of the third running, when it was suggested that the race should be named after him, Rockingham is said to have replied: &#145;No, it was my friend St Leger who suggested the thing to me&#151;name it after him&#146;  (St Leger, 66). The St Leger stakes, run annually at Doncaster racecourse, remains, in the first decade of the twenty-first century, one of five British classic flat races.<br>
<br>Although St Leger had been promoted colonel in the army on 29 August 1777, it was only in 1779, after the entry of France and Spain into the American War of Independence, that he resumed his active military career. Just as the marquess of Granby had done nineteen years previously when he raised the Royal Foresters, his son Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, offered to raise a regiment at no expense to the government. As before, St Leger was given an appointment, this time as colonel (gazetted 30 September 1779). The unit was subsequently taken onto the army's establishment as the 86th regiment of foot. In April 1780 St Leger sailed with his new regiment to the West Indies, where he eventually took command of the forces on the island of St Lucia. When, in May 1781, St Lucia was menaced by a French fleet under the comte de Grasse, St Leger's &#145;most soldierly dispositions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 24, 110) proved sufficient to deter a serious attack. Promoted major-general on 19 October 1781, he was to remain in the West Indies for the rest of the war, the request made by him in February 1782 to be allowed to return to Europe for the sake of his health having been refused by the government.<br>
<br>The 86th regiment of foot was disbanded after the peace of 1783 and St Leger went on half pay, but in 1785 he received a position as a general officer on the staff in Ireland, where the duke of Rutland was now viceroy. He died on 19 April 1786 in Dublin, and was buried in St Anne's Church, Dublin. As he had no children, his nephew <a href="#cosubject_89477">John Hayes St Leger [<i>see below</i>]</a>, succeeded to his estate and an income of &pound;2000 a year.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_53718"></a><span class="headword">Barrimore Matthew <span class="st"> [Barry]</span> St Leger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was Anthony's younger brother. He was baptized on 1 May 1733, probably at or near Grangemellon, co. Kildare, like his brother, and followed his elder brother to Eton (1745&#150;8) and Peterhouse, Cambridge (1751&#150;5) before being commissioned an ensign in the 28th regiment of foot on 27 April 1756. His regiment sailed to America in 1757, and it was while there, on 24 March 1758, that St Leger succeeded to a captaincy in the 48th regiment of foot, serving at the capture of Louisbourg in 1758, and the victory at Quebec the following year. The lieutenant-colonel of the 48th regiment was Ralph Burton, who in 1750 had married St Leger's sister Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1753); and when Burton was given command of the right brigade at Quebec for the advance on Montreal in July 1760, St Leger was appointed his brigade major. Similarly, after Burton received the colonelcy of the 95th regiment of foot in December 1760, St Leger eventually joined him as the regiment's major (16 September 1762).<br>
<br>With the end of the Seven Years' War the 95th regiment was disbanded. Barrimore St Leger may now have returned to Cambridge, as he was elected Ramsey fellow at Peterhouse in 1763. Although promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 25 May 1772, St Leger did not succeed to command of a regiment until he received the 34th regiment of foot on 20 May 1775. On 7 or 18 April 1773 he married Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayley, Lady Mansel (<i>d</i>. 1788), widow of Sir Edward Mansel, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1754), of Trimsaran, Carmarthenshire; they had no children. Lady Mansel had inherited her husband's estate and Trimsaran probably became their country residence, though they also had a London house in the parish of St George, Hanover Square. In 1776 St Leger led his regiment to combat the rebellion in America and was present during the opposed landings at Trois-Rivi&egrave;res, Canada, on 8 June. St Leger's previous experience of warfare in North America then recommended itself to General Sir John Burgoyne in the planning of his 1777 campaign in the Hudson Valley: St Leger was given command of the secondary thrust in the Mohawk Valley. Advancing from Oswego, on Lake Ontario, on 26 July 1777, St Leger led his force of 340 regular troops, 360 provincials and Canadian militia, and 1000 Native Americans against Fort Stanwix, held by 750 Americans. The strength of the garrison and the fortifications surprised St Leger, and having failed to bluff the enemy into surrender by holding a review of his army within their view, he settled down to a siege. An attempt by 850 American militia under General Nicholas Herkimer to relieve Fort Stanwix was defeated at Oriskany on 6 August. However St Leger's Native American forces suffered heavy losses, and a simultaneous sortie by the besieged garrison against the British camp and the looting of their effects increased the disenchantment. St Leger's endeavour to stampede Fort Stanwix's defenders into surrender by suggesting that he might not be able to restrain the Native Americans from massacring the Mohawk Valley's civilian population was rejected with contempt. His small calibre artillery had no effect on the fort's defences, and, when news came of the approach of another American relief force under Benedict Arnold, the Native Americans, alarmed by an exaggerated report of enemy numbers, deserted <i>en masse</i>. St Leger was forced to withdraw on 22 August. Retracing his steps to Canada, he was unable to unite with Burgoyne's main force before the latter's surrender at Saratoga on 17 October. The most recent historian of St Leger's expedition suggests that its British commander suffered from a drink problem.<br>
<br>Barrimore St Leger spent the remainder of the American War of Independence in Canada, commanding troops at Sorel and St John's. He was promoted colonel on 17 November 1780 and, in October 1781, led a 1000-strong force to Crown Point to make contact with Vermont separatists, a negotiation brought to an abrupt end by news of the British defeat at Yorktown. In November 1784 he succeeded General Frederick Haldimand as commander of British troops in Canada; but suffering ill health, and without waiting for orders, he resigned his command the following year and retired from the army. He then disappeared and even his elderly wife was forced to draw up her will in March 1787 on the assumption that he was dead. St Leger, however, reappeared either shortly before or immediately after his wife's death and proved her will on 8 November 1788. On 12 May 1793 he married, at the abbey church, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Frances Lindley, his long-standing companion, with whom he had two children, John Lindley St Ledger (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1766, <i>d</i>. in or after 1804) and Catherine (1782&#150;1801). He died at Worksop on 26 December 1793 and is commemorated in the abbey church by a memorial. His son received a commission in his father's old regiment, the 34th foot, in 1787, and was transported in 1797 after supporting the United Irishmen in Armagh. He fled Australia in 1804 and was not heard of again.<br>
<br>Anthony and Barry's nephew, <a name="cosubject_89477"></a><span class="headword">John Hayes St Leger</span>  (1756&#150;1800), <span class="occ">army officer, courtier, and rake</span>, was born on 23 July 1756, the eldest son of John St Leger (1726&#150;1769) of Grangemellon, co. Kildare, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Colonel Thomas Butler. Educated at Eton College (1767&#150;70), he received a commission on 24 September 1778 as captain in the 55th regiment of foot. He was promoted major in the 90th foot on 26 November 1779 before transferring to the 80th foot in 1780, in which regiment he was made lieutenant-colonel on 25 October 1782. By this time &#145;Handsome Jack&#146; St Leger was an intimate of George, prince of Wales. Already an accomplished rake, having some years earlier cut a swathe through the <i>demi-monde</i> of Louis XVI's court in France, St Leger's roistering incurred the disapproval of George III, who warned the prince against emulating &#145;conduct that makes all good men despise a St Leger&#146;  (Aspinall, 1.44). The prince, in contrast, considered St Leger &#145;one of ye best fellows yt. ever lived&#146;  (ibid., 1.57), commissioned portraits of them both by Thomas Gainsborough, and in February 1784 appointed him a groom of the bedchamber in his household. Eventually, however, St Leger's expenses outran his income, and in 1785 he retired to Ireland to recoup his fortune. While there he is credited&#151;in company with Buck Whaley&#151;with the revival of the Dublin Hell Fire Club, notorious for its black masses and orgies. He also renewed the St Legers' connection with the Manners family and was a familiar face at the viceregal court of Charles, fourth duke of Rutland. Indeed so extravagant were the compliments paid by St Leger to the duke's beautiful wife, Mary Isabella&#151;on one occasion at a dinner party he drank the water with which she had just cleaned her teeth&#151;that the gossip was that they were having an affair. Certainly after the duke's death in 1787 they did become lovers (although she soon switched her attention to Frederick, duke of York, to the concern of the prince of Wales, who expressed anxiety as much for St Leger's sake as his brother's).<br>
<br>By now, at least, St Leger was solvent, having in 1786 inherited his uncle Anthony's estate. After returning to England in 1787 he was reappointed to the prince's household, as well as receiving a commission as captain and lieutenant-colonel of the 1st foot guards. In 1791 he was elected to parliament for the borough of Okehampton, leaving behind him the political hooliganism that six years before had seen him lead a whig mob in smashing the marquess of Buckingham's windows. By 1793, as the whig split became increasingly apparent, he gravitated towards the duke of Portland's wing of the party; he stood down from parliament three years later. St Leger's military interests were instead now uppermost, and having accompanied the duke of York to Berlin in 1791, he became the duke's deputy adjutant-general, and later barrack-master, during the Flanders campaigns of 1793 and 1794. A brevet colonelcy in 1793 was followed by promotion to major-general on 26 February 1795, while St Leger's brief period as lieutenant-colonel of the 16th light dragoons in 1794&#150;5 gave way to a colonelcy of the 80th regiment of foot on 16 June 1795. In August 1796 St Leger sailed to take command of the troops at Trincomalee in Ceylon. He died, unmarried and childless, at Madras on 31 January 1800 following a convulsive fit; his estate passed to his brother, Anthony Butler St Leger.<br>
