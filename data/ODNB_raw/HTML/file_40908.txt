<span class="headword">Kable,  Henry</span>  (1766/7&#150;1846), <span class="occ">transported convict and merchant</span>, was born and lived in Suffolk, like his father, Henry Cabell (<i>d</i>. 1783). Both were illiterate and unskilled labourers, and little is known of Henry Kable's early life. He joined a rural gang notorious for thefts from farms, and in 1783 he, his father, and an accomplice were found guilty of house burglary and sentenced to death. The elder two were hanged on 5 April 1783, but sixteen-year-old Kable was reprieved on condition of transportation.<br>
<br>Confined to Norwich Castle gaol, Kable fathered a son, Henry, in 1786. The mother, another convict, Susannah Holmes (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1825), was an illiterate Norfolk spinster of no trade, also reprieved from execution and awaiting transportation. With her baby a few months old, Susannah was ordered to Plymouth to join the first fleet bound for New South Wales. When her baby was refused permission to join her and Kable refused permission to marry her, the English press reported the distress of this young convict family so sympathetically that a public subscription was opened and &pound;20 subscribed to assist the family in their exile. Lord Sydney himself was approached and intervened, personally ordering that both father and son should embark with Susannah.<br>
<br>After arriving at Sydney Cove in January 1788, Kable married Susannah at the first religious service performed by the colony's chaplain, on 10 February 1788. They subsequently had ten children, all baptized by the Church of England chaplains. Such close family life was both unexpected and unrecognized in a penal colony reputed infamous for the criminality, depravity, and immorality of its convict inhabitants.<br>
<br>In July 1788 Kable and Susannah issued a writ against the master of the <i>Alexander</i> for withholding the goods that they had bought in England. Their case was the first to be heard in the colony's court of civil jurisdiction. Although convicts were arguably ineligible to sue or be sued, they won their case and the master was ordered to make restitution. It is argued by legal historians that this favourable verdict was Kable's &#145;greatest impact&#146;  (Neal, 177) on England's convict colony, the verdict &#145;establishing a foothold &hellip; for the rule of law tradition&#146;  (ibid., 190), thus ensuring that the exercise of power by an arbitrary governor was not automatically dependent on either prison discipline or martial law but rather on legal principles.<br>
<br>Kable's working life did not conform with the traditionally accepted pattern for convicts. In 1789 Kable and some of his associates established the night watch to maintain law and order. He was overseer of the watch (1791) and chief constable (1794&#150;1802) and was deeply involved in procedures and practices in both civil and criminal cases. Business prospered. By 1800 Kable's colonial-built vessels promoted sealing, whaling, and inter-colonial trade, and by 1807 Cable &amp; Co. owned both colonial and foreign-built ships carrying goods and passengers to England. In 1820 he was one of twenty &#145;most important emancipist landholders&#146; in New South Wales  (TNA: PRO, CO 201/123/D5).<br>
<br>In 1805 Kable clashed with Governor William Bligh, who refused permission to trans-ship goods between two of Cable &amp; Co.'s vessels. Bligh imprisoned Kable and his wealthy ex-convict partners in Sydney gaol for one month and fined them &pound;100 each for addressing him &#145;improperly&#146; and in a derogatory manner. After Bligh's deposition (1808) Kable energetically supported the rebels, and, with his two partners, publicly subscribed &pound;500 to assist John Macarthur's English defence against charges of rebellion. (Macarthur later wrote to his wife that this promissory note could not be honoured in England.) During the interregnum (1808&#150;10) Kable continued to increase his land grants and town allotments, and all his grants were confirmed by Governor Macquarie in 1810. By 1819 Kable was one of the colonial emancipists who, describing themselves as the &#145;wealthy middle class&#146;, petitioned the prince regent for civil rights denied them in the colony to whose economic development they had contributed so greatly. The accumulated wealth and landholdings of these ex-convicts far exceeded those of the free settlers.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife (8 November 1825) Kable lived with his son John at Windsor until his own death, at Hawkesbury, on 16 March 1846. He was buried with Susannah at St Matthew's, Windsor. They had been married for thirty-seven years, during which time Kable, the notorious transported felon, had become the wealthy colonial settler. The text at that first marriage ceremony at Sydney Cove had been: &#145;What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?&#146;  (<span class="roman">Psalm 116</span>: 12) which would have been more appropriate at his funeral. Despite lack of education or skill, and despite the infamy of being a convict, his positive response to and exploitation of the unique colonial environment was influential on the economic and social development of early Australia. As an entrepreneur, a businessman, and a family man, Kable, the ex-convict first fleeter, helped to lay the foundations for the new and respectable society which was to become Australia.<br>
