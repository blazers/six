<span class="headword">Rashleigh,  Philip</span>  (1729&#150;1811), <span class="occ">mineralogist and antiquary</span>, was born on 28 December 1729 at Aldermanbury, London, the eldest son of Jonathan Rashleigh (1693&#150;1764), a London merchant, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clayton. Rashleigh matriculated from New College, Oxford, in 1749 but left without taking a degree. Members of the family, owners of estates throughout Cornwall, had represented the borough of Fowey in parliament for generations. On the death of his father, Rashleigh was elected member for Fowey in 1765 and sat continuously, despite various contests and disputes, until retiring in 1802, by which time he had become the &#145;father&#146; of the House of Commons. &#145;A thoroughly independent country gentleman, critical of general reform and of radicals&#146;; only three speeches of his are reported, all of very minor importance  (Namier, 3.348). &#145;His attendance was poor&#146;; in 1796 he wrote, &#145;I have no inclination to fling away &pound;50 on a journey to add one more to a majority&#146;  (Thorne, 5.9).<br>
<br>The expansion of tin and copper mining during his lifetime led to Rashleigh's interest in mineralogy. Initially through his own efforts, he amassed a significant mineral collection, but later added to it by exchange and purchase from British and European collectors and dealers. It was, and still remains, unrivalled for its content of Cornish specimens. The upper zones of the rich Cornwall deposits were being exploited when Rashleigh formed the collection and he obtained a tremendous variety of unusual and rare minerals, many of them known only from this region and several only from his specimens. He was ahead of his time in cataloguing the source and locality of the specimens. He attempted moderate scientific experiments and analysis, but as the science became more technical he declared, &#145;I think we shall Refine Mineralogy too much&#146;  (letter, 22 March 1789, Russell bequest, NHM); but he assisted in its development by providing material for others. In 1797 Rashleigh published the first volume of his <span class="italic">Specimens of British Minerals</span>, with the second volume appearing in 1802. In this he achieved his ambition to provide accurate coloured illustrations of minerals&#151;the first successful attempt in Britain, which has also become bibliographically significant owing to its typography  (Bethel). His knowledge of mineralogy led to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1788. The threat of invasion by Napoleon made him consider giving up collecting and the increase in competition and prices reduced the number of acquisitions but he continued to make substantial purchases up to 1809.<br>
<br>Rashleigh had an interest in antiquities, particularly artefacts obtained from tin streamworks that related to the prehistory of Cornish mining and his collection once contained the late Saxon hoard of metalwork from Trewhiddle (later moved to the British Museum). He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and published several papers in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>.<br>
<br>From 1756 Rashleigh virtually retired to Cornwall, and upon inheriting the estates he was forced to live modestly while he restored the family's position and by prudent management cleared the debts arising from his father's excesses. He managed the estate and finances of his several wards until they came of age. To settle the family's finances he exploited the family's involvement in local mining activities. Such financial difficulties had reduced his own marriage prospects but on 17 April 1782, at the age of fifty-two, he married his first cousin, Jane Pole (1720&#150;1795).<br>
<br>Letters reveal that Rashleigh was often confined to the house, Menabilly, near Fowey, during the latter years of his life: &#145;My time of Life draws fast to an End and my Infirmities grow likewise&#146; (10 July 1792, Russell bequest, NHM; 6 April 1804, Sowerby archive, NHM). However, he remained active until 1811, when he died at his home on 26 June &#145;without a single groan or Struggle&#146;  (Charles Rashleigh, Antony House Archives, CC/M/44), having made meticulous bequests to all his relatives, friends, and servants. He was buried at Tywardreath, Cornwall. Through his management the Rashleigh family was reinstated as one of the leaders in mining and agricultural reforms within the county and, his being childless, his estates passed to a nephew, William Rashleigh (1777&#150;1855).<br>
