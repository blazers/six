<span class="headword">Rattigan, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1904), <span class="occ">jurist in India</span>, was born at Delhi on 4 September 1842, the youngest son of Bartholomew Rattigan, who left his home, Athy, co. Kildare, at an early age and entered the ordnance department of the East India Company, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Abbott, of Deptford. Educated at the high school, Agra, Rattigan entered the &#145;uncovenanted&#146; Bombay civil service in youth and was an extra assistant commissioner at Lahore in the Punjab, acting for a short time as judge of the small causes court at Delhi. Dissatisfied with his prospects he resigned, against his family's wishes, to study law. Enrolled as a pleader of the Punjab chief court on its establishment in 1866, he built up an extensive practice, first in partnership with Mr Scarlett, and then on his own account.<br>
<br>Rattigan was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 3 November 1871, and was called to the bar there on 7 June 1873, also studying at King's College, London. He returned to Lahore where he speedily rose to be head of his profession. He was for many years government advocate, and in 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1886, for varying short periods acted as a judge of the chief court. In November 1886 he resigned his acting judgeship to continue his practice without interruption. A linguist of unusual ability, he mastered five European languages, several Indian vernaculars, and Persian. German he studied assiduously, and he translated as <span class="italic">Jural Relations</span> (1883) the second book of Savigny's work on modern Roman law. In 1885 he took the degree of DL, with first-class honours, at G&ouml;ttingen.<br>
<br>In February 1887 Rattigan became vice-chancellor of Punjab University, then on the verge of bankruptcy. He succeeded in regenerating it and was reappointed biennially, retaining the vice-chancellorship until April 1895. He was made a DL of the university in January 1896, and LLD of Glasgow in 1901. In 1891 he accepted the presidentship of the Khalsa College committee, and by his energy and influence overcame dissension among the Sikhs, with the result that an institution for their higher education on a religious basis was established at Amritsar in 1897. When he retired from India in April 1900 the Sikh council appointed him life president, and on his death a memorial hospital was erected at the college (opened in 1906). He was an additional member of the viceroy's legislative council in 1892&#150;3 and of the Punjab legislative council in 1898&#150;9.<br>
<br>A self-made man, without advantages of family influence, Rattigan made substantial contributions to legal literature amid his professional and public labours. He published <span class="italic">Selected Cases in Hindu Law Decided by the Privy Council and the Superior Indian Courts</span> (2 vols., 1870&#150;71), <span class="italic">The Hindu Law of Adoption</span> (1873), and <span class="italic">De jure personarum</span> (1873), and he collaborated with Charles Boulnois (1832&#150;1912) of the Punjab chief court in <span class="italic">Notes on the Customary Law as Administered in the Punjab</span> (1878). His most important book, <span class="italic">A Digest of Civil and Customary Law of the Punjab</span> (1880), which reached a seventh edition (1909), was designed to classify material for a future codification, and rendered Rattigan a foremost authority on customary law in northern India. His other works were <span class="italic">The Science of Jurisprudence</span> (1888), which, chiefly intended for Indian students, reached a third edition (1899); <span class="italic">Private International Law</span> (1895); and a pamphlet on the international aspects of the case of the Netherlands South African Railway (1901). Rattigan was knighted in January 1895, made QC in May 1897, and elected bencher of his inn in June 1903.<br>
<br>Rattigan was married twice: first, on 21 December 1861 at Delhi to Teresa Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of Colonel A. C. B. Higgins CIE, examiner of accounts, public works department; and second at Melbourne&#151;in a marriage that could not then legally have taken place in England&#151;on 1 April 1878 to her sister Evelyn. By his first marriage he had two daughters and four sons, and by his second three sons.<br>
<br>Rattigan settled in England in 1900, and practised before the privy council. In the 1900 &#145;khaki&#146; general election he contested as a Liberal Unionist the largely mining constituency of North-Eastern Lanarkshire and was defeated by the Liberal candidate. However at a by-election there on 26 September 1901, with the anti-Unionist vote split between the Liberal candidate and Robert Smillie of the Scottish Workers' Representation Committee, Rattigan was elected on a minority of votes and sat until his death. Speaking rarely, and chiefly on Indian subjects, he was respected by all parties. He was killed in a motor accident at Langford near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, on his way to Scotland, on 4 July 1904, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London. He was survived by his second wife. A memorial window was placed in the chapel of Harrow School, where his sons were educated, and a tablet in Lahore Cathedral.<br>
