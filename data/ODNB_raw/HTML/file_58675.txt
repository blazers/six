<span class="headword">Bathurst <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Meeking]</span>,  Violet Emily Mildred</span>, Lady Apsley  (1895&#150;1966), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 3 Cavendish Square, London, on 29 April 1895, the elder of two daughters of Lieutenant Bertram Charles Christopher Spencer Meeking (1864&#150;1900) of the Royal Hussars, and his wife, Violet Charlotte Fletcher (<i>d</i>. 1921). Her father died of enteric fever at Bloemfontein, during the South African War, when she was not yet five; in 1912 her mother married Herbert Johnson. On the death of her grandfather Charles Meeking in 1912, she succeeded to the family estate, Richings Park, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, which she sold in 1922. During the First World War she served with a Voluntary Aid Detachment.<br>
<br>Violet Meeking was active in Conservative politics from the 1920s, an involvement which was reinforced by her marriage on 27 February 1924 to Allen Algernon Bathurst, Lord Apsley (1895&#150;1942); they had two sons. Her husband was the elder son of Seymour Henry Bathurst, seventh Earl Bathurst, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65832/', "Lilias Margaret Frances Bathurst, Countess Bathurst")</script>, who, as daughter of Algernon Borthwick, Baron Glenesk, had inherited the proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. Lord Apsley was Unionist MP for Southampton (1922&#150;9) and National Conservative MP for Bristol Central (1931&#150;42); Lady Apsley, as she was now known, served as president of the women's Conservative associations in his constituencies (1924&#150;9 and 1932&#150;52). When, as parliamentary private secretary to the department of overseas trade, Lord Apsley was sent to Australia to investigate complaints about the treatment of emigrant settlers, Lady Apsley convinced him that she should accompany him to investigate the women's point of view. They published their experiences in the jointly written <span class="italic">Amateur Settlers</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Lady Apsley was a lifelong participant in equestrian sports, and rode with hounds. She wrote three books on the subject: <span class="italic">To whom the Goddess</span> (1932), on hunting and riding for women, written with Lady Diana Shedden; <span class="italic">Bridleways through History</span> (1936), a history of hunting from prehistoric times, written with her husband; and <span class="italic">The Fox-Hunter's Bedside Book</span> (1949), a compilation of stories about the sport. From 1946 to 1956 she was joint master of Earl Bathurst's hunt. Inspired by her husband, who was a keen aviator and had commercial interests in airlines, she obtained her aircraft pilot's licence in 1930.<br>
<br>Lady Apsley was county commandant for the Auxiliary Territorial Service for Gloucestershire, where the Apsleys lived, in 1938&#150;9, and group commander in 1939&#150;40. She was ATS welfare officer for the county from 1940 to 1943. After the outbreak of war she became increasingly involved in local politics, serving on Sudbury rural district council (1941&#150;3). On her husband's death, on 17 December 1942, on active service on Malta, she was nominated to succeed him as Conservative candidate for the Bristol Central parliamentary constituency. Because of the wartime electoral truce between the parties, no official Labour candidate stood against her, but there were three independents, including Jennie Lee. As a result she had to undertake a great deal of campaigning, despite being confined to a wheelchair following a hunting accident. She won the seat (18 February 1943) with a slightly larger majority than her husband had enjoyed.<br>
<br>Lady Apsley made a profound impact on the House of Commons when she appeared in her wheelchair, dressed in mourning. Her maiden speech (23 March 1943), in a debate on war pensions and disablement, drew upon both her personal experience and her position as national chair, since 1942, of the women's section of the British Legion. Her parliamentary career was, however, short, for she lost the Bristol seat in the 1945 general election. She subsequently contested Bristol North-East as Conservative and National Liberal candidate, but without success. She died on 19 January 1966.<br>
