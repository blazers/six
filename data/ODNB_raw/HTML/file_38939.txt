<span class="headword">Cropper,  James</span>  (1823&#150;1900), <span class="occ">paper manufacturer and politician</span>, was born on 22 February 1823 in Duke Street, Liverpool, the eldest of the three surviving sons and six daughters of John Cropper (1797&#150;1874), merchant of Liverpool, and his wife, Anne (1797&#150;1876), daughter of John and Mary Wakefield of Sedgwick, Kendal. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6781/', "James Cropper (1773&#150;1840)")</script>, philanthropist and slavery abolitionist. The family were of Lancashire Quaker yeoman stock from Bickerstaffe from at least the early seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Cropper passed his boyhood at the family home of Dingle Bank on the Mersey where he was introduced early to the world of letters through family connections with Lord Macaulay, whose sister Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1834) was the second wife of Cropper's uncle Edward Cropper (1799&#150;1877). After school in Liverpool he went on to Edinburgh University, where he decided against going into the family business in Liverpool in favour of paper manufacture, which he learned first with Alex Cowan &amp; Sons at Penicuik, near Edinburgh.<br>
<br>At the same time Cropper made the other important decision of his career: to leave the Society of Friends and enter the Church of England. Both actions, in business and in religion, were not entirely uninfluenced by his devotion to his cousin Fanny Alison Wakefield (1825&#150;1868), whom he had known since childhood and to whom he was formally engaged in 1843. At her wish he was baptized and they were married at Heversham parish church, near Kendal, on 25 November 1845. Fanny was the second of four daughters and two sons of John Wakefield (1794&#150;1866) of Sedgwick House, Kendal, and was born at Broughton Lodge, Cartmel, on 10 April 1825. The marriage consolidated the close links with the leading banking and manufacturing family in Westmorland.<br>
<br>The Croppers lived near Kendal, first at the mill house adjoining the Cowen Head paper mill until after the birth of their elder daughter, Frances Anne (1846&#150;1934), when they moved to a new house, Ellergreen, they had built in 1847 at Burneside; there a second daughter, Mary Wakefield (1849&#150;1943), and a son, Charles James (1852&#150;1924), were born. The marriage was close and happy but cut short by the early death of Fanny on 3 February 1868. Cropper filled the gap left by this loss largely by devoting himself to a prodigious range of public service in education, religion, and politics. He built and endowed a new hospital in Kendal in her memory in 1870, later the Westmorland County Hospital.<br>
<br>The basis of Cropper's power and influence lay in his paper-making business, which he entered in July 1845 by leasing the Cowen Head and Burneside mills from Cornelius Nicholson. He did not gain full control until 1854, but had formed a private company in 1852 and set about expanding and modernizing the mills, aided by an increase in demand for paper and by improved transport links (the Kendal to Windermere line opened in 1847 alongside the Burneside mill and he was an influential director of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Company). Despite heavy losses when a fire destroyed the Burneside mill in 1886, production reached 3000 tons by the time the limited company was established in 1889 and had doubled to 6000 tons by 1900 when the firm was established as a leading paper manufacturer in the north of England.<br>
<br>Cropper came to exert great influence in the community, but as an <i>arriviste</i> in local gentry terms, though well connected, he felt it necessary to build up a landed estate to give greater substance to his social position and political interests. Over 2000 acres had been acquired by 1900, centred on Ellergreen. Under his energetic leadership he dominated every aspect of social life in the locality, providing housing for his workforce, building the new school, and influencing moral standards through the temperance movement, the Mutual Improvement Society, and the church. His strong sense of social duty was based on Christian principles, but he did not care for his leadership to be questioned. He was strongly opposed to disestablishment.<br>
<br>Cropper had long wished to enter parliament. His public service began early with the chairmanship of the Kendal board of guardians (1853) and as JP (1863), but as an active Liberal of great organizational ability he was an obvious potential candidate. Following the death of John Whitwell shortly after the 1880 general election, he served as the last MP for the borough of Kendal (1880&#150;85), but although he contested the new county division of South Westmorland in December 1885 he lost to the Conservative, Lord Bective, by 277 votes. His political position shifted in 1886 when hostility to home rule pushed him into the Liberal Unionist camp, although his respect for established authority did not sit easily with Liberal demands for change. However, his appetite for public service was undimmed when in 1889 the first Westmorland county council was elected and he became its chairman (1889&#150;1900) and threw himself indefatigably into the work of its committees. He also served as high sheriff of Westmorland in 1875&#150;6 and was a deputy lieutenant.<br>
<br>Cropper was ever hopeful of improving the human condition and was a tireless pamphleteer and lecturer for education and the church. Among many benefactions he founded an open scholarship at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. He was taken ill while visiting the Paris Exhibition and died at 157 rue de la Pompe, Paris, of acute pneumonia after four days on 16 October 1900. He was buried in Burneside churchyard beside his wife on 20 October.<br>
