<span class="headword">Onions,  (George) Oliver</span>  (1873&#150;1961), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 29 July 1873 at 37 Ripon Street, Bradford, Yorkshire, the eldest child of at least three children of George Frederick Onions, a cashier, and his wife, Emily Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fearnley. His interest in art took him to London and Paris to study, and he tried to make a living at posters, book designing, and similar work. It was poorly paid, so he turned to writing for periodicals. Sketches and other pieces were collected in <span class="italic">The Complete Bachelor</span> (1900), and short stories of Yorkshire written for magazines were collected in <span class="italic">Tales from a Far Riding</span> (1902) before he leapt, as he said, from the frying pan of journalism into the &#145;fire of authorship&#146; with the autobiographical novel <span class="italic">The Odd Job Man</span> (1903).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Odd Job Man</span> was followed by a string of mostly realistic fictions: <span class="italic">The Drakestone</span> and <span class="italic">Back o' the Moon</span> (both 1906), <span class="italic">Admiral Eddy</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Pedlar's Pack</span> (1908), <span class="italic">Draw in your Stool</span> and <span class="italic">Little Devil Doubt</span> (both 1909). On 10 June 1909 Onions married the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31633/', "Amy Roberta (Berta) Ruck (1878&#150;1978)")</script>. <span class="italic">The Exception</span>, a tale of blackmail, was published in 1910, and the supernatural work <span class="italic">Widdershins</span> followed in 1911. <span class="italic">Widdershins</span> gained him critical approval&#151;he always maintained an uncritical popular readership by following the fashions&#151;which the weakness of his next novel, <span class="italic">Good Boy Seldom</span> (1911), could not destroy.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Good Boy Seldom</span>, like <span class="italic">Little Devil Doubt</span>, concerned an ambitious and not over-scrupulous young man, a favourite theme of Onions. He used it again in <span class="italic">In Accordance with the Evidence</span> (1912), a popular book that was followed by two more along the same rather sensational lines: <span class="italic">The Debit Account</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">The Story of Louie</span> (1914). They were successful in Britain, from Secker in London, and from Doran in New York. Frank Swinnerton and others liked their &#145;veracity&#146;, a term which at the time covered a multitude of sins (and exculpated some sinners, too).<br>
<br>The readership this trilogy established stuck with Onions through the rest of his busy career as he moderated his early preachiness (J. B. Priestley had complained of intrusive &#145;author's remarks&#146; in a <span class="italic">London Mercury</span> review; Ashley, 233), embraced topicality, titillated with somewhat sordid relationships, introduced new women and fellow authors as characters, toyed with psychological analysis, and entertained with historical novels and ghosts and misty moors. In 1918 Onions changed his name by deed poll to George Oliver, but by then he had established himself as a popular writer and all his work was signed both before and after that date Oliver Onions. Ever striving for success, he remained inventive&#151;and industrious, although it was said that he &#145;wrote with difficulty, even with anguish&#146;, perhaps over-sensitive to adverse criticism of his work  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Yet Onions published some forty books, including collections of short stories, ending with the posthumous <span class="italic">A Shilling to Spend</span> (1965).<br>
<br>A reviewer in <span class="italic">The Atlantic</span> hailed Onions in 1914 as &#145;the cleverest&#146; and &#145;the most advanced of the younger English novelists&#146;  (Ashley, 233), but in the event, Onions had to compete with Conrad, Galsworthy, Joyce, Woolf, and D. H. Lawrence, among others. However, he entertained a public who did not read such giants of literature. When Onions died on 9 April 1961 at Bronglais Hospital, Aberystwyth, British fiction had left him behind. <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Tapestry</span> (1946) is his best historical novel. <span class="italic">The Collected Ghost Stories of Oliver Onions</span> (1935) is his work most likely to last.<br>
