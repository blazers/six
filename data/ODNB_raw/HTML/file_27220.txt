<span class="headword">Thomas,  George Housman</span>  (1824&#150;1868), <span class="occ">painter and wood-engraver</span>, was born in London on 17 December 1824, the son of William Thomas, a shipbroker. He was educated at Mr Lord's school in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and later served an apprenticeship under the wood-engraver George Bonnar. In 1839 the Society of Arts awarded him with a silver palette for <span class="italic">Please to Remember the Grotto</span>, an illustration of his depicting the commencement of the oyster season. He moved to Paris with his brother-in-law Henry Harrison, a fellow pupil of Bonnar's, to set up an engraving business which employed six or seven assistants. In 1846 he went to New York with Harrison and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27248/', "William Luson Thomas (1830&#150;1900)")</script>, to work on illustrated newspapers, printing one <i>en route</i> for the amusement of those on the ship. In the two years he spent in the United States he also sketched the country's slave districts and designed vignettes for American banknotes.<br>
<br>On his brief return to England in 1848, due to ill health, Thomas began a long working association with the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. As an illustrator of newspapers he was an innovator: George and Edward Dalziel noted in their <span class="italic">The Brothers Dalziel: Record of Fifty Years' Work</span> (1901) that he was &#145;One of the first, if not the first, to draw on wood direct from life&#146;  (Dalziel and Dalziel, 41). He travelled to Rome later that year to draw the French siege of the city for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. His ambition to be recognized as an artist of note led him to consider his visit to Italy as a source for future paintings. He returned to England in 1849 to marry Ellen Harrison and to begin painting from his Italian sketches. In 1851 he exhibited <span class="italic">St Anthony's Day in Rome</span> at the British Institution in London, which was followed by <span class="italic">Garibaldi at Rome, 1849</span>, shown at the Royal Academy in 1854. He gained the patronage of Queen Victoria, who had seen his work in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> and on exhibition at the Royal Academy. The first commission, <span class="italic">The Presentation of Crimean Medals by Queen Victoria, 18 May 1855</span> (exh. RA, 1858; Royal Collection), was called by the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> &#145;one of the best of the modern ceremonial pictures we have ever seen&#146;  (20, 1858, 171). Other important commissions included <span class="italic">Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort at Aldershot</span> (exh. RA, 1866; Royal Collection) and <span class="italic">The Investiture of the Sultan with the Order of the Garter, 17 July 1867</span> (exh. RA, 1868; Royal Collection), as well as more intimate portrait drawings of the queen. He also painted many genre scenes such as <span class="italic">The Ghost Story</span> (exh. RA, 1866).<br>
<br>As an illustrator Thomas was prolific: as well as contributing to <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">The Quiver</span>, and <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, he illustrated Harriet Beecher Stowe's <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> in 1852 (from his American sketches), Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</span> in 1857, and Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">Armadale</span> in 1866&#151;three of his best-known book illustrations. His influence on his brother William was immense and a very great number of illustrations by George were engraved by William. After suffering some time from the consequences of a riding accident, he died on 21 July 1868 at Boulogne, France. He left nine children and a widow who was awarded a pension. He was a popular man of energy and humour, though his career was dogged by ill health. The <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> of 22 August 1868 observed his &#145;keen sense of humour&#146;  (177), and his brother William, in an <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> volume of 1869 on George, wrote: &#145;to all who knew him, his character cannot fail to form a model on which to mould&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">Drawings</span>, 15). A retrospective exhibition of his works was held at the German Gallery, Bond Street, London, in 1869.<br>
