<span class="headword">Leslie,  George</span>, first earl of Rothes  (<em>c.</em>1417?&#150;1489/90), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son of Norman Leslie of Fythkill in Fife, who died about February 1440, and Christian, daughter of Sir John Seton of Seton. He inherited a considerable collection of lands, mainly on the east coast: Leslie in the Garioch; Rothienorman, Fowlis Mowat, and Cushnie in the adjoining earldom of Mar; Rothes in Moray; Fythkill and Tacis in Fife; and Cairny in Perthshire. Consequently he was among the first Scottish nobles elevated to the new rank of lord of parliament in the minority of James II, becoming first Lord Leslie of Leven probably in 1445&#151;a creation, if not a date, confirmed by two extant charters issued by him with this style in 1448. He further increased his status through important marriage alliances and by providing local support to the adult James II in the king's dealings in north-east Scotland.<br>
<br>On 5 November 1457 Leslie served on the Aberdeen assize of error which found against the claim of Thomas, Lord Erskine (of whom Leslie held lands), to the earldom of Mar, so confirming it as a crown possession. Leslie was rewarded by James II on 20 or 21 March 1458 with the earldom of Rothes (based on his castle barony in Moray), the barony of Ballinbreich in Fife, confirmation of all his other lands, and the erection of Leslie-Green into a burgh of barony. James II clearly intended Rothes to be a royalist counterweight in north-east Scotland to the earls of Orkney, Crawford, and Huntly. But the remainder of Rothes's career seems to have been low-key and troubled. In May 1459 his annulment of his second marriage on the grounds of relationship within the fourth degree was disputed by William Sinclair, third earl of Orkney (<i>d</i>. 1480), whose son and daughter were by then married to Rothes's children from this marriage. Arbitration by the chapter of St Andrews Cathedral allowed the annulment, granted on 22 May 1459, and legitimation of the offspring. The latter was presumably Sinclair's concern, along with some &pound;500 Scots which by &#145;certain contracts&#146; of marriage Rothes had been bound to pay Sinclair in 1459. (Sinclair's successor would litigate against the second earl of Rothes for this in 1498&#150;9.) That on 15 October 1464 the privy council declared Rothes not guilty of forging the signet of the late James II on a royal acquittance of debt of 200 merks may also point to financial problems.<br>
<br>Rothes attended parliament often between 1467 and 1481 and on 8 February 1476 received the barony of Balmain in Kincardineshire after the forfeiture of John MacDonald, earl of Ross and lord of the Isles. But he was never a regular royal charter witness and seems to have withdrawn from national affairs into neutrality just before the first of the civil wars of James III's reign, in 1482. At some stage, though, there was an apparent rift within the Leslie family (perhaps dating back to Rothes's marriage annulment in 1459): on 10 February 1487 James III ordered Rothes&#151;who suffered &#145;personal apprehension&#146; by the sheriff of Aberdeen&#151;on pain of immediate ward in Dumbarton Castle to provide for his grandson and heir, <a href="#cosubject_54255">George, master of Rothes [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was to continue in the king's retinue.<br>
<br>The earl's subsequent fortunes are uncertain, but he died between 31 August 1489 and 24 May 1490 and was probably buried in Leslie churchyard, Fife. He and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of John Lundin of that ilk, whom he married <i>c</i>.1435, had a daughter, Margaret. About 1440 he married Christian, widow of Alexander Leslie, earl of Ross, and daughter of Walter Haliburton of Dirleton and Isabel Stewart (daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany). They had three children: Andrew, who died before January 1478, having married Elizabeth, daughter of William Sinclair of Orkney; Elizabeth, who married William Hay, third earl of Erroll, another north-east magnate; and Christian, who married William Sinclair, later Lord Sinclair. Rothes's third wife was Elizabeth Campbell.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54255"></a><span class="headword">George Leslie</span>, second earl of Rothes  (<em>d.</em> 1513), second surviving son of the first earl of Rothes's only son, Andrew, was infefted on 25 May 1490 in his grandfather's lands, with the addition of Balmullo in Fife. But his career was racked by legal actions over feudal casualties and criminal activity, and he was pursued by the crown and several individuals (including his wife, the bishop of Moray, and the earl of Orkney and Caithness). Probably as a result of his support for James III in 1487&#150;8, Rothes was pursued before the lords of council on 22 October 1490 for arrears of non-entry (payment due to the crown by a tenant-in-chief when lands are first acquired) for Ballinbreich, for which he was to pay over &pound;800 Scots and more in kind to Patrick Hepburn, earl of Bothwell (<i>d</i>. 1508), then guardian of James IV; three days later he was pursued by his grandfather's widow for two years' wrongful occupation of Ballinbreich, which she claimed to own. Rothes failed to compear, and his lands were seized and distrained to yield the sum required. Significantly, about this time Rothes's father-in-law, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1514), was gradually being displaced from his political and territorial offices.<br>
<br>Rothes, though, was as much a crook as a victim. On 23 April 1498 he was fined &pound;100 Scots for non-compearence at Cupar justiciar's court to answer for the murder of one George Leslie, or Dunlop, and he subsequently became a fugitive, failing to compear in court to face the charges four times between 1500 and 1509. On each occasion he was fined &pound;1000 Scots, declared an outlaw, and had his goods forfeited to the king. This was despite crown attempts to rehabilitate Rothes: on 2 March 1506 James IV granted to William Leslie, brother and heir of George, the right to counsel the earl not to waste &#145;so noble and famous a house&#146;, so disinheriting his rightful heir. But Rothes's intractability left him open to royal fiscal opportunism. In March 1508 Rothes lost his Fife lands for alienating some of them without royal licence and was fined &pound;2210 Scots for eighty-five years' non-entry to Balmain (which the first earl had been given only in 1476, unaware of the previous tenant's debts). The king granted out many of Rothes's other lands and collected their feudal revenues anew, until the Leslies recovered them after the battle of Flodden.<br>
<br>The second earl of Rothes died between 24 February and 31 March 1513. Some time between 1484 and 1488 he married Jane or Janet (<i>d</i>. before 10 July 1494), fifth daughter of the fifth earl of Angus. They had no children, and Rothes was succeeded by his brother William.<br>
