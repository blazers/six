<span class="headword">Corfield,  William Henry</span>  (1843&#150;1903), <span class="occ">sanitarian</span>, born on 14 December 1843 at Shrewsbury, was the eldest son of Thomas Corfield, chemist, and his wife, Jane Brown. Educated at Cheltenham grammar school, he gained a demyship in natural science at Magdalen College, Oxford, and matriculated on 12 October 1861; he gained a first class in mathematical moderations in 1863. While studying at Oxford Corfield was selected by C. G. B. Daubeny to accompany him to Auvergne, France, where he investigated the volcanic landforms in the Montbrison district. He graduated BA at Oxford in 1864, and from 1865 to 1875 he held the Sheppard medical fellowship at Pembroke College, Oxford. Corfield entered University College, London, as a medical student in 1865; in 1866 he won the Burdett-Coutts scholarship at Oxford for geology, and in 1867 he was elected Radcliffe travelling fellow.<br>
<br>Influenced by Sir Henry Acland and by George Rolleston, Corfield had by this time directed his attention to hygiene and sanitary science. He spent some time in Paris, where he attended Apollinaire Bouchardat's lectures and studied hygiene under Professor Berthelot at the Coll&egrave;ge de France. He proceeded afterwards to Lyons, worked in clinical medicine and surgery, and made a special study of the remains of the aqueducts of ancient Lugdunum. He also visited some of the medical schools in Italy and Sicily. He graduated MB at Oxford in 1868 and MD in 1872. In 1869 he was admitted MRCP, and in 1875 he was elected FRCP. He became a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry in 1877. Corfield married in 1876 Emily Madelina, youngest daughter of John Pike FSA; they had six children.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1869 Corfield had been appointed professor of hygiene and public health at University College, London, and in 1875 he opened the first laboratory in London for the practical teaching of hygiene. In memory of E. A. Parkes, in 1876 Corfield actively helped to found a museum of practical hygiene, which was situated first at University College, then at Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, and after 1909 at Buckingham Palace Road, Westminster. Corfield was medical officer of health for Islington (1871&#150;2), and for St George's, Hanover Square (1872&#150;1900), and he was at one time president of the Society of Medical Officers of Health.<br>
<br>A member of the committee appointed in 1869 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to inquire into the treatment and utilization of sewage, Corfield worked as reporter to the committee until 1875, and he became an ardent advocate of land filtration and sewage farms. At the Royal Society of Arts in 1879 he delivered the Cantor lectures, entitled &#145;Dwelling houses, their sanitary construction and arrangements&#146;; in 1893 he gave the Harveian lecture before the Harveian Society of London, entitled &#145;Disease and defective house sanitation&#146;; and in 1902 he gave the Milroy lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, &#145;On the aetiology of typhoid fever and its prevention&#146;.<br>
<br>Corfield shares with Rogers Field the honour of being a pioneer in house sanitation and of being the first to enunciate the hygienic principles of a healthy home. Public interest was aroused in 1871 when the prince of Wales (the future Edward VII) contracted typhoid fever at Londesborough Lodge, Scarborough. For the next thirty years Corfield enjoyed a large consulting practice throughout England, in connection with the sanitation of public and private buildings. In 1899 he was the first holder of the newly established office of consulting sanitary adviser to the office of works.<br>
<br>With John Netten Radcliffe, Corfield was joint secretary of the Epidemiological Society from 1870 to 1872, and he was president in 1902&#150;3. He was also president of the public health section of the British Medical Association meeting held at Bristol in 1894 and of a section of the sanitary congress of the Sanitary Institute held at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1896, and he originated the successful International Congress of Hygiene held in London in 1891. He represented the office of works at the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography, of which he was honorary president, at Paris in 1900; and he presided at the conference held by the Sanitary Institute at Paris in August 1900 under the auspices of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise d'Hygi&egrave;ne.<br>
<br>Corfield belongs to the second generation of sanitary reformers in England. Entering professional life after a general education, he took up the subject of public health where it had been left by Edwin Chadwick, John Simon, Sir George Buchanan, Netten Radcliffe, Richard Thorne-Thorne, and others, and carried it forward into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Corfield was a collector of rare books and a connoisseur of bindings. His library was especially rich in works on fishing. He was also a lover of prints, and made a fine collection of Bewick woodcuts. For more than twenty years he was chairman of the committee of the Sunday Society, which promoted the opening of museums, picture galleries, and public libraries on Sunday. Corfield died on 26 August 1903 at Marstrand in Sweden, during a visit for his health.<br>
<br>In addition to his numerous appointments and large practice Corfield published many works, mostly on sanitary dwelling arrangements and the problems presented by sewerage. <span class="italic">Laws of Health</span> (1880) reached nine editions, and <span class="italic">Dwelling Houses: their Sanitary Construction and Arrangements</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">Disease and Defective House Sanitation</span> (1896) were both translated into other European languages.<br>
