<span class="headword">Marre <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gilling]</span>,  (Romola) Mary</span>, Lady Marre  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">voluntary worker and public servant</span>, was born on 25 April 1920 at 2 High Street, Chelmsford, Essex, the eldest child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Aubrey John Gilling, bank manager, and his wife, Romola Marjorie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Angier, the daughter of a sailmaker in Brightlingsea, Essex. She was educated at Chelmsford County High School for Girls, and went on to Bedford College, University of London, graduating with a second-class degree in philosophy in 1941. During the war London University was evacuated to Cambridge, where along with many other students she was attracted to communism, and may have joined the Communist Party. After leaving university she worked as a civil servant in the Ministry of Health for a year before joining the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1942. On 24 December 1943 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39883/', "Alan Samuel Marre (1914&#150;1990)")</script>, son of Joseph Moshinsky, a Russian Jewish immigrant who ran a tobacconist's shop in the East End of London. Marre was a civil servant: he was knighted in 1970 and was appointed parliamentary ombudsman in 1971. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>While her children were young Mary Marre did voluntary work locally in north London, and in 1962 she became the organizer of the West Hampstead Citizens' Advice Bureau. In 1965 she was appointed deputy general secretary of Camden Council of Social Service, and through her work there became known to those working in the voluntary sector as an excellent committee chairman. From 1974 to 1984 she served as chairman of the London Council of Social Service (renamed in 1978 the London Voluntary Service Council), which provided advice for local councils of social service, which co-ordinated links between voluntary organizations and the local authorities. She was founder president of Barnet Voluntary Service Council from 1979. Among the many other voluntary organizations and committees she was involved with were the Prince of Wales's Advisory Group on Disability, of which she was a member from 1982 to 1984. She was also deputy chairman of the Royal Jubilee Trusts from 1981 to 1988. As a trustee from 1975 and vice-chairman from 1989 to 1993 of the City Parochial Foundation, which funded charities which were tackling poverty in London, she was particularly closely involved with the work of the Trust for London. Set up by the government in 1986, after the abolition of the Greater London council, with the City Parochial Foundation as trustee, the Trust for London concentrated on making small grants to locally based community groups, especially to black and ethnic minority organizations, refugee committees, and women's groups, at a time when there were very few other sources of money for such groups: these included the Haringey Muslim Women's Council, the Centre for Armenian Information and Advice, the Tamil Action Committee, and the Kurdish Charitable Association. She was instrumental in the awarding of grants to supplementary schools, run by minority ethnic groups outside school hours to help children keep up with their school work, and mother-tongue schools, which helped children to remain fluent in their original languages. She was appointed CBE in 1979.<br>
<br>When the Law Society and the Bar Council set up the Committee on the Future of the Legal Profession in 1986 they appointed Lady Marre as chairman. As a lay person, but a former member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Legal Aid (1975&#150;80), and with her reputation as an efficient chairman, she was a good choice to head the committee of six barristers, six solicitors, and six independent members, whose object was to look at the changes necessary to improve the legal profession and its ability to meet the needs of the public. The Marre committee presented its report, <span class="italic">A Time for Change</span>, two years later, with a note of dissent attached from five of the barristers and one independent member. Its main conclusion was that it was not in the public interest that the crown courts should continue to be the exclusive preserve of the bar, and it recommended that solicitors should be able to plead in the crown courts, and should be eligible for appointment as High Court judges: it was over these encroachments on the traditional preserve of the bar that the committee could not agree. Because the committee had failed to find a solution acceptable to both sides, and because of the acrimonious public debate that followed publication of the report, the lord chancellor, Lord Mackay, introduced three green papers on the future of the legal profession. These led to the introduction of the <span class="roman">Courts and Legal Services Act</span>, which became law in 1990 and implemented many of the proposals of the Marre committee.<br>
<br>After the death of her husband in 1990 Mary Marre found great happiness in her relationship with Alan Lipfriend (1916&#150;1996), a retired crown court judge, with whom she lived in Edmunds Walk, East Finchley, from 1991 until his death. Lipfriend was a practising Jew, a member of the New London Synagogue in St John's Wood. Mary Marre had converted to the Jewish faith before her marriage, but neither she nor her husband was a practising Jew: she now reconverted, and became very interested in and committed to Judaism, and involved in Jewish charities. This continued after Lipfriend's death.<br>
<br>A lively, intelligent woman, Mary Marre was rooted in the voluntary sector, and saw that it was no use giving money for projects unless there were good people there to run them. She had a deep understanding of London and its needs. Astute and shrewd, with a terrier-like mind, she was greatly respected by her colleagues and staff, who listened to and valued her advice, and she in turn was a conduit for other people's ideas. Alongside her serious concern for disadvantaged people she had a sense of humour and a light touch, and with a very wide network of friends and contacts she was extremely effective in getting things done. Having moved to Kingsbarns, near St Andrews, Fife, she died of heart disease on 6 March 2005 in St Andrews Care Home, 1 James Foulis Court, St Andrews. She was survived by her son and daughter.<br>
