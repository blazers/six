<span class="headword">Watson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wall]</span>,  Edith Mary</span>  (1888&#150;1966), <span class="occ">suffragist and police officer</span>, was born on 6 November 1888, in the infirmary, Hackney union workhouse, the illegitimate daughter of Martha Wall, a domestic servant. With her mother and stepfamily, Edith lived in Marylebone, helping with her mother's sweated labour, sewing buttons on shirts. She was educated at Bell Street board school and Hampden Gurney School. Leaving school at fourteen she travelled to South Africa as a children's nurse, later becoming a Salvation Army captain. At this time she was attacked and almost raped by a fellow officer, a decisive factor in her views on sexual violence. Chestnut-haired and tall, she married Ernest John Watson (1883&#150;1969), a Post Office sorter, on 1 February 1912; they were divorced about 1926. Their only child, Bernard John Watson, was born on 29 July 1919.<br>
<br>Returning to England in 1909, Edith Watson abandoned her religious beliefs, became interested in socialist politics, and joined the Social Democratic Federation. She soon became involved in the Edwardian suffrage campaign and in 1911 enlisted in the Women's Freedom League, a militant, non-violent suffrage society. She was imprisoned for chaining herself to the doors of Marylebone magistrates' court and wrote a column for the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, &#145;Sketches in green, gold and white&#146; (the Women's Freedom League colours) for a time. She was particularly concerned about the treatment of women in the judicial system and outraged at the ways in which victims of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and abuse were treated in court. She felt very strongly that the legal system was weighted in favour of the perpetrators of violence, rape, and incest, that crimes against women were punished more leniently than crimes involving property, and that the experiences of women and girls were discounted. For three years from 1912, using the Women's Freedom League journal, <span class="italic">The Vote</span>, she recorded details about cases of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and harassment and compared their sentences with those handed down for other crimes. Patchy and inconsistent as the methods were, the work was an early attempt to quantify and analyse intractable social problems, hitherto withheld from the public domain. This all added to the demand for a judicial system fairer to women and for women to serve throughout police and judicial systems.<br>
<br>When the First World War began in 1914, Edith Watson and her colleague Nina Boyle (Constance Antonina Boyle, suffrage campaigner and writer, later a founder member of the Save the Children Fund) started a women's police service under Women's Freedom League auspices. Adapting late-Victorian morality campaigners' use of volunteer patrols to rid the streets of prostitutes, Watson and Boyle aimed to protect women's interests and guarantee their rights of access to public space. Edith Watson was the first woman to wear a police uniform, designed by Boyle&#151;&#145;a useful blue serge Norfolk jacket with pockets, straw Panama hat with blue ribbon and white armlet&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Vote</span>, 10, 252, 21 Aug 1914, 286). As the war progressed and military activity disrupted civilian life, other groups, similar to the volunteers though with rather more repressive attitudes, emerged and amalgamated with the women's volunteer police. Generally unpopular with regular police services, the volunteers patrolled the streets assisting women and children. Other tasks included supervising servicemen's wives and ensuring curfews were obeyed, which led to disagreement about whether women police should be used to preserve women's rights or to service the state. Ultimately, despite the original aims, women police were mainly used by the authorities to control the behaviour of working-class females. By 1915 Boyle and Watson acknowledged that their vision of a feminist framework to policing was untenable and relinquished their claims on the women police volunteers, most of whom became part of the renamed Women's Police Service, which continued in an uneasy relationship with official police bodies. It was not until 1923 that women police were officially sanctioned and given powers of arrest.<br>
<br>Active in the Independent Labour Party for many years, Edith Watson was a branch secretary in Marylebone and an election agent, standing unsuccessfully at local council elections. She helped union efforts to improve working conditions in mental hospitals, disguising herself as a nurse to obtain evidence. For many years she campaigned for the Divorce Law Reform Union&#151;a small but vocal pressure group. In the early 1930s Nina Boyle had investigated the cruelties inherent in the practice of female genital mutilation, demanding its abolition in countries under British rule. One of Edith Watson's last campaigns was to publicize and criticize the practice in Kenya in the 1950s. She died in a nursing home at 3 St Botolph's Road, Worthing, Sussex, on 25 March 1966. Born illegitimate and poor, the victim of sexual harassment, a divorced lone parent, Edith Watson voiced the experiences of such women, campaigning on their behalf for over forty years.<br>
