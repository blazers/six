<span class="headword">Embleton,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1273&#150;1333), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of Newcastle</span>, is believed to have come from Embleton near Dunstanburgh, a barony given to Edmund, earl of Lancaster, after its forfeiture by Simon de Montfort. His parents are unknown, but he may have been related to the Richard of Sweethope who in 1296 had the highest assessment in the liberty of Embleton, where he was one of the assessors. By 1296 Embleton was in business in Newcastle, where he was assessed in the parish of St Nicholas, listed next to Sampson Cutiller, the wealthiest merchant in the town, for whom, with Sampson's wife, Agnes, Embleton endowed two chantries in 1332. This suggests a family relationship, probably matrimonial. Embleton married three times: first, before 1305, Alice, and second Isabel (their surnames are unknown); his third wife, who survived him, was Christian, daughter of John (I), Lord Mowbray.<br>
<br>Embleton appears in the Newcastle customs accounts for 1295&#150;7 as shipping wool, wool-fells, and hides; and in the detailed customs of 1308 he is the leading shipper of wool. Entries in the royal wardrobe books show him supplying Edward II with stores, including grains, malt, and wine (1311/12), and oxen and sheep (1312/13). He was still shipping wool in 1325. In December 1330 he was granted a personal freedom from all tolls throughout the realm, in consideration of his losses during the wars with Scotland, while in October 1332 he was granted a safe conduct for two years to buy wine in Gascony.<br>
<br>In 1301 Embleton was one of the four town bailiffs, who served under the mayor, and he represented Newcastle in the convention of burgesses held at York in 1303. Many times mayor between 1306 and 1333, often for several years in succession, he was also one of Newcastle's representatives in parliament in 1311, 1314, 1324, 1325, 1328 (twice), and 1332. In 1314 and 1315 he was ordered to supervise the sheriff of Northumberland in garrisoning Newcastle Castle. He was responsible for maintaining order in Northumberland in 1317, following the plot to seize the cardinal legates on embassy to secure peace between England and Scotland (and the subsequent insurrection led by Gilbert Middleton), and was authorized to receive into the king's peace such rebels as submitted. In 1322, immediately before the final rebellion of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, Embleton was made joint custodian of the town of Newcastle with the mayor, and, after the earl's defeat, was made keeper of the lands of the earl and his followers within Northumberland, with responsibility for their management. This included the garrisoning of Dunstanburgh Castle with forty men-at-arms and forty hobelars. In June 1323 he was granted for his services interim possession of two parts of the manor of Silksworth in co. Durham, forfeited by Robert Holland, subsequently confirmed with the remaining third in March 1324. At the same time he was appointed, with Ralph Neville of Raby, a keeper of the truce with Scotland. His responsibilities in maintaining the king's peace in Northumberland and Durham were renewed in June 1324, and widened to include reconciling men who had joined the Scots and rebels through poverty and now wished to return to their first allegiance. In June 1333 he brought eleven men-at-arms and twenty-one hobelars from Newcastle to serve Edward III at Berwick against the Scots. He was then ordered back to Newcastle on royal business, but later returned with seventeen men-at-arms and thirty hobelars and other armed men, and was killed at the battle of Halidon Hill outside Berwick on 19 July 1333.<br>
<br>By then Embleton held the manor of Silksworth in co. Durham and lands throughout Northumberland, from Jesmond by Newcastle to Newton on the Moor, Embleton, and Mindrum, some of them acquired by purchase. He was commemorated in the chantries which in 1332 he was licensed to found at St Nicholas's, Newcastle, and at Embleton, to be served by two priests each. He used two seals. One was an antique gem. The other showed a sleeping lion with the motto &#145;Ci dort le [lio]n fort&#146;. Embleton was unusual in the frequency and lengths of his tenures of office as mayor of Newcastle, and also in the use which successive kings made of his services to supervise the maintenance of law and order in Northumberland and Durham. This strongly suggests his origins were in a landowning family of administrators, a conclusion supported by his final marriage alliance with Christian Mowbray. Although his failure to produce a male heir frustrated any hopes of founding a local dynasty, the thirds of his estate which passed to daughters formed an important element in the capital of later merchant grandees of Newcastle&#151;Bertram Anderson (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1570), Richard Hodgson (<i>c</i>.1516&#150;1585), and, through Sir Reginald Carnaby, William Cavendish, first earl of Ogle and duke of Newcastle (1593&#150;1676).<br>
