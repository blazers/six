<span class="headword">Solomons <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Starkey]</span>,  Estella Frances</span>  (1882&#150;1968), <span class="occ">landscape and portrait painter</span>, was born on 2 April 1882 at 32 Waterloo Road, Dublin, the elder daughter of Maurice E. Solomons, optician, and his wife, Rosa Jane Jacobs. As a girl she attended the Misses Wades' school in Morehampton Road, Dublin. She then went to a school in Hanover, Germany, and on her return spent some time at Alexandra College, Dublin. She studied under William Orpen at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and at the Royal Hibernian Schools under Walter Osborne. She first exhibited with the Young Irish Artists in 1903 and at the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1905. Her visit to Amsterdam in 1906 to see the Rembrandt tercentenary exhibition was deeply influential. It has been claimed that the exhibition turned her from &#145;the subdued impressionist manner of her early landscapes to <i>chiaroscuro</i> in portraits, and a quality of introspection which she retained even after her portrait style lightened to become colourful and expressive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Women Artists</span>, 187). She returned to Holland in 1911, and sketched at Volendam. In Ireland Solomons painted in Dublin, in the Dublin hills, and in Donegal and co. Kerry. In her landscape paintings her manner &#145;is rapid and expressionist, using wedges of gleaming colour, with brilliant highlights&#146;  (ibid., 118).<br>
<br>Solomons joined the nationalist organization Cumann na mBan (&#145;Council of Women&#146;) in 1915. It was through this organization that she met Kathleen Goodfellow (1891&#150;1980), whom she painted several times, and who became a lifelong friend. Goodfellow was to provide funding for the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span>, founded by the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62940/', "James Sullivan Starkey (pseudonym Seumas O'Sullivan) (1879&#150;1958)")</script>, Solomons's companion and later husband. The couple did not marry until 1926, after the deaths of Solomons's parents, who would not have accepted her marrying outside the Jewish faith. Both Solomons and Starkey were at the centre of Irish cultural and artistic life until the 1950s. After the 1916 rising various men &#145;on the run&#146; were sheltered in her family home, and she painted some of them. She became widely known as a portraitist. She painted the writers James Stephens, George Russell, and Alice Milligan. Of her portrait painting it has been observed that she was &#145;never interested in background, only in the personality she painted, and often attempted a peremptory thrust of the figure so as to create a moment of immediacy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Women Artists</span>, 118).<br>
<br>Solomons taught etching at the Dublin municipal technical schools, and in 1922, refusing to take the obligatory oath of allegiance to the British crown, she resigned from her post. Etchings by her illustrated J. S. Starkey's <span class="italic">Mud and People</span> (2nd edn, 1918); Padraic Colum's <span class="italic">The Road Round Ireland</span> (1926); and the third edition of D. L. Kelleher's <span class="italic">The Glamour of Dublin</span> (1928). In 1925 she was appointed an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy. She exhibited there at the annual members' exhibition for sixty years. Solomons ceased painting in the mid-1950s. She was bedridden for some time before her death at her home, 2 Morehampton Road, Dublin, on 2 November 1968. An exhibition of her work entitled &#145;&#147;Works from an artist's studio&#148;: Estella Solomons, 1882&#150;1968&#146; was held at the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork, in 1986. Her life was the subject of a film, <span class="italic">Estella</span>, directed by Steve Woods and screened at the Galway Film Fleadh in 2000. Her works can be found in many public collections including the Ulster Museum, Belfast, the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork, the Sligo County Museum and Library, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, the Irish Jewish Museum, and the National Gallery in Dublin.<br>
