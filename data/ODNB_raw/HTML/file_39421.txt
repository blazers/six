<span class="headword">Sands,  Robert Gerald <span class="st"> [Bobby]</span></span>  (1954&#150;1981), <span class="occ">Irish republican and hunger striker</span>, was born in Abbot's Cross in Newtownabbey, a northern suburb of Belfast, on 9 March 1954, the son of John Sands, a Post Office worker, and his wife, Rosaleen. The eldest of four children, he was educated at Stella Maris primary school and the local Catholic secondary school. He left school in June 1969 and attended Newtownabbey Technical College for nine months before getting a job as an apprentice coach builder. Sands, who was a keen and able sportsman, played football for a local team with a mixed membership and was also a member of Willowfield Temperance Harriers, a well known and predominantly protestant running club. His family moved into the Rathcoole housing estate in Newtownabbey when he was seven. Rathcoole was a new public authority estate, the largest in western Europe, and until the outbreak of the troubles in August 1969 it had a substantial number of Catholic tenants. By the time Sands left school the deepening political crisis was generating tense inter-community relations and the beginning of the ugly process of intimidation of minorities in housing estates and workplaces throughout Belfast. Catholics were the minority in Newtownabbey and Rathcoole, and from 1969 onwards there was a growing exodus to areas such as the Catholic Twinbrook estate in west Belfast, where Sands's family was forced to move in June 1972.<br>
<br>There was no history of republican involvement in his family, and Bobby Sands was typical of a generation of young working-class Catholics whose republicanism was born out of the sectarian conflagration of August 1969 which brought British troops onto the streets of Belfast and Londonderry. Sands joined the provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1972 and was arrested for the first time in October 1972. While on remand he married on 3 March 1973 Geraldine Noade, a seventeen-year-old shop assistant. They had a son. Geraldine Sands moved to England after Sands was imprisoned in 1977. Charged with possession of four handguns and sentenced to five years in April 1973, he was sent to Long Kesh prison (renamed the Maze in 1976) near Lisburn. Granted special category status by the British government in June 1972, the paramilitary groups controlled their own compounds inside the prison. Sands was in cage 11. It was here that Sands and other young republicans acquired a political education that was a mixture of traditional republicanism and revolutionary theories then current in the developing world. Sands became &#145;officer commanding&#146; one of the huts in the compound and took a leading role in organizing political education and Irish language classes as well as beginning his own attempts at political analysis and politicized verse.<br>
<br>Released in April 1976, within six months Sands was involved in an IRA attempt to bomb a furniture showroom in south-west Belfast which was interrupted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Sentenced to fourteen years in September 1977, he was sent back to Long Kesh (as republicans continued to call it). In the interim special category status had been abolished for all new paramilitary offenders and Sands was put in the new cellular accommodation known as the H blocks. Republican prisoners had launched a campaign for the restoration of special category status which involved the refusal to wear prison uniforms: the &#145;blanket protest&#146;. This developed into the &#145;dirty protest&#146; as, refused permission to leave their cells to go to the toilet unless they wore prison uniform, they began to smear their cells with excrement. By late 1980 there were 837 republican prisoners in Long Kesh, of whom 341 were on the dirty protest. Frustrated by the failure of the protest to shift the British government and the lack of active support in the Catholic community for their demands, seven prisoners began a hunger strike on 27 October 1980. It ended after fifty-three days with an ambiguous understanding between the government and the leadership of the republican movement. This soon broke down and a second hunger strike began on 1 March 1981. Ten men had been chosen to follow one another in a phased process, with Sands, who was now the IRA leader in Long Kesh, the first.<br>
<br>Sands had now become the prisoners' most effective literary voice, with a stream of prose pieces and poems smuggled out for publication under the pseudonym of Marcella. These were written during his involvement in the prison protests, which he had joined as soon as he entered Long Kesh in September 1977. They reveal a literary talent wedded to a romantic&#150;fatalist acceptance of death rather than compromise. He died on 5 May 1981 after sixty-six days without food (the government rejected the possibility of force-feeding the prisoners), and nine more prisoners were to die before the hunger strike was called off. More than 100,000 people attended his funeral at Milltown cemetery, Belfast, on 7 May. Even before his death he contributed powerfully to the emergence of Sinn F&eacute;in, the IRA's political wing, as a significant political force in Northern Ireland. Sinn F&eacute;in organized for him to be nominated as H block candidate in a by-election for the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat at Westminster. His victory on 9 April 1981 was a powerful impetus for the group of republican revisionists around Gerry Adams who, while still wedded to the armed struggle, believed that it could be defeated unless assisted by a political breakthrough. The victory of Sands allowed Adams to persuade the traditionalists in the movement that Sinn F&eacute;in's involvement in electoral politics would complement and not undermine armed struggle.<br>
