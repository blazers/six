<span class="headword">Pearson,  (Edward) Hesketh Gibbons</span>  (1887&#150;1964), <span class="occ">actor and biographer</span>, was born on 20 February 1887 in Hawford, Worcestershire, the second of the two sons and four children of Thomas Henry Gibbons Pearson (1853&#150;1942), gentleman farmer, churchwarden, and amateur sportsman, and his second wife, Amy Mary Constance (1855&#150;1934), eldest daughter of George Hesketh Biggs, vicar of Ettington. He attended Bedford grammar school.<br>
<br>As a man without qualifications Pearson drifted towards a commercial career but, after two and a half years in a City shipping office, he was rescued by a legacy of &pound;1000 from an aunt. Having spent almost all this money on adventurous travelling in South America, the United States, and Canada, he returned in 1908 and was rescued this time by his brother, who employed him as manager of his motor-car showroom in Brighton. Pearson used these years to provide himself with an artistic education, listening to music, reading widely, and growing increasingly responsive to the beauties of the English countryside. He was particularly influenced by the works of Oscar Wilde and of Bernard Shaw, and by the Shakespearian productions of Herbert Beerbohm Tree: Wilde, Shaw, Shakespeare, and Tree, the four authors of what he called his &#145;revelations&#146;, were all to be subjects of his biographies. In 1911, despite his lack of training and regardless of parental disapproval, Pearson joined Tree's company and he subsequently acted also in the productions of Harley Granville-Barker and Sir George Alexander, whom he often understudied.<br>
<br>Though invalided out of the infantry in 1915 with tuberculosis, Pearson volunteered the following year for the Army Service Corps, and served for three years in Mesopotamia and Persia. He rose to the rank of captain and was awarded the MC. He almost died from a combination of dysentery, malaria, septic sores, and a head wound, and he attributed his unexpected recovery to reciting Shakespeare's plays, several of which he knew by heart.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Pearson resumed his acting career but he also began to publish short stories, essays, and journalism. His anonymous volume of pen portraits, <span class="italic">The Whispering Gallery being Leaves from the Diary of an ex-Diplomat</span> (1926), led to his arrest on a charge of &#145;obtaining or attempting to obtain money under false pretences&#146;, but under cross-examination his engaging candour appealed to the jury, which found him not guilty. In 1931 he left the stage to write biographies, beginning with a life of his maternal ancestor Erasmus Darwin, and he followed this with <span class="italic">The Smith of Smiths</span> (1934), a still popular biography of the Revd Sydney Smith, which carried an inviting introduction by G. K. Chesterton. Pearson's technique as a biographer derived from his career on the stage. To some extent he acted his subjects on the page. He did not take his readers back into history so much as bring Thomas Paine, William Hazlitt, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Walter Scott, and others forward, as if they had suddenly walked in from the street. His treatment was informal and impressionistic, depending on entertaining anecdotes, skilful use of quotation, and the dextrous building up of incidents for its effect. Over the 1930s and 1940s he became the most popular biographer in Britain. Assessing his impact on the reading public, Graham Greene wrote that he had &#145;some of the qualities of Dr Johnson&#151;a plainness, an honesty, a sense of ordinary life going on all the time&#146;.<br>
<br>Pearson's work owed something to the influence of his Johnsonian friend Hugh Kingsmill. He was to pay tribute to Kingsmill after his death in an exchange of letters with Malcolm Muggeridge, published as <span class="italic">About Kingsmill</span> (1951), and he recalled what had been the deepest friendship of his life between the lines of <span class="italic">Johnson and Boswell</span> (1958), the last book written at the height of his powers.<br>
<br>Impetuous, opinionated, athletic, good-looking, and full of fun, Pearson was an attractive figure to many women. He felt no competitiveness with other writers and was encouraging to people younger than himself. His genial temperament was, however, punctuated by uncontrollable flashes of temper. These sudden rages, which he attributed to his head wound but which may have been connected with the suppression of inherited melancholy, always passed quickly and disappeared in late life. On 6 June 1912 Pearson married the actress Gladys Rosalind Bardili (1882/3&#150;1951), daughter of Julius Carl Bardili, a German brewer, and his English wife, Emma Gardner, whose surname Gladys used on stage. They had one son who died in 1939. Shortly after his wife's death in 1951 he married on 14 June 1951 Dorothy Joyce Ryder (1912&#150;1976), bank cashier, daughter of Frank Bonham Ryder, an electrical engineer. Pearson died on 9 April 1964 at his home, 14 Priory Road, Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>Pearson wrote two autobiographical books, <span class="italic">Thinking it Over</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Hesketh Pearson by Himself</span> (published posthumously in 1965). After his death, from the 1970s into the new century, several of his biographies were reissued, including his lives of Shakespeare, Tree, Shaw, Wilde, and Whistler, with new prefaces by Anthony Burgess, Sir John Gielgud, Richard Ingrams, Peter Quennell, and Benny Green. These biographies and others have now been overtaken by recent scholarship, but they remain excellent introductions to their subjects' lives, and have begun to appear as audiobooks.<br>
