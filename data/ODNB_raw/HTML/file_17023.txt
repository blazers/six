<span class="headword">Lort <span class="st"> [Lorte]</span>, Sir  Roger</span>, first baronet  (1607/8&#150;1664), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was the eldest son of Henry Lort of Stackpole, Pembrokeshire. He was admitted as a gentleman commoner to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1624, aged sixteen, sharing a chamber there in 1625 with his brother Sampson. He matriculated on 3 November 1626, graduated BA on 11 June 1627, and proceeded to the Middle Temple. In 1632 he married Hester, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/563/', "Francis Annesley, second Viscount Valentia (bap. 1586, d. 1660)")</script>. The &#145;ambidextrous&#146; Lorts played a leading role in Pembrokeshire. In 1643 Lort was an active royalist, commissioned by Lord Carbery to raise a regiment, and on 19 April of that year Lort and Robert Rudd, archdeacon of Carmarthen, were sent for as delinquents by parliament. In August 1643 Lort secured possession of Tenby for the king, by threats and lavish financial guarantees. Carbery's royalists then dissipated their forces and Lort's fortified house at Stackpole, a few miles south of Pembroke, was the first garrison attacked, falling on 30 January 1644. He rapidly submitted to parliament, agreed to serve on parliamentary committees (like many other former royalists), and was freed from delinquency and restored to his estates on 26 July 1644, though a fine of &pound;1000 was imposed on 8 September 1645.<br>
<br>While in London securing his future Lort published his &#145;first book&#146; of Latin epigrams, <span class="italic">Epigrammatum Rogeri Lort, armigeri, Cambro-Britanni, Oxoniensis &hellip; liber primus</span> (1646), comprising fourteen pages of reasonably accomplished elegiacs&#151;evidence of the value of Latin for furthering personal ambition. The book was rare by Wood's time, though Nicholas Lloyd &#145;commended the poems therein to be very good&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.232). Lort reveals a genuine interest in poetry (including Christopher Ocland's <span class="italic">Anglorum praelia</span>), and close friendship for Archdeacon Rudd and former Middle Temple colleagues. He presents himself as a loyal parliamentarian, moderate in religion, lamenting the cruelties of civil war (worse than the conduct of wild bears or boars; Lort, <span class="italic">Epigrammatum</span>, 1), the proliferation of newspapers, and the unsightly brawls of Independents and presbyterians. Driven from home and family by Sir Charles Gerard, leader of a royalist counter-offensive, he describes how he undertook a perilous sea voyage to London. Fairfax receives extravagant praise, as equal to Gustavus Adolphus. The fiercest scorn is reserved for &#145;J. P. Pembrochiensem rapacissimum&#146; (John Poyer, parliamentary governor of Pembroke Castle), who resented the Lorts' successful trimming. The feud with Poyer continued and Poyer imprisoned the Lorts in 1647, refusing Fairfax's order for their release. Soon afterwards Poyer was in revolt against parliament, with the Lorts now acting as loyal parliamentary commissioners and suppliers. One contemporary thought Roger Lort &#145;of any principle or religion to acquire wealth&#146;, and Sampson no better  (Leach, 221); another that Roger fought &#145;in preservation of no cause but his own&#146;  (Jenkins, 26). By the Restoration, Lort was a royalist again, and in 1662 he was created a baronet. He died in 1664, survived by his second wife, Ann Wyndham (who later married Sir Edward Mansel); Lort was buried at St Petrox Church, Stackpole. The baronetcy passed to his son John; it died out in 1698 with Lort's grandson Gilbert. Lort's final epigram of 1646 promises further compositions, if they please the reader (if not, he says, that is more than enough); for whatever reason, there was no second book.<br>
