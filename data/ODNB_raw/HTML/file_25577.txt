<span class="headword">Simon,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1618, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">medallist and seal-engraver</span>, was baptized on 26 April 1618 at the French protestant church in Threadneedle Street, London. He was the fourth son of Peter (or Pierre) Simon, a merchant, a native of London but of French descent, and his wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1588), the daughter and heir of Gilles Germain, a merchant of St Peter Port, Guernsey, and the brother of the wax modeller and engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25574/', "Abraham Simon (bap. 1617, d. c.1692)")</script>. His other siblings were Peter (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1612&times;14), Hannah, William (<i>bap</i>. 1616), Samuel (<i>bap</i>. 1619), Nathaniel, and Laurence. On 30 August 1633 Thomas was apprenticed for eight years to a London goldsmith, George Crompton. However, in 1635, probably through the commendation of Sir Edward Harley, he began a seven-year apprenticeship to Edward Greene, also a goldsmith, and chief engraver at the mint. Greene was himself subject to the direction of Nicholas Briot, whose artistry undoubtedly influenced Simon. Simon's first attributed work was the Scottish rebellion medal of 1639 commemorating the treaty of Berwick.<br>
<br>The apprenticeship ended during the civil war, when Simon's French protestantism ensured his loyalty to parliament. Although he was not yet a member of the mint establishment he continued to work there, making, on the order of parliament, a new great seal, for &pound;100 (which had been taken to the king at York in 1642). After the death of Edward Greene in 1644, Thomas Simon and Edward Wade were appointed joint chief engravers on 4 April 1645. The quality of the coinage during the latter half of the 1640s is not impressive: it is assumed that Wade did this work and Simon the medals. On 15 February 1649 Simon married Elizabeth, the daughter of Cardin Fautrart. They were married at All Saints', Maidstone, Kent, though his wife's family originated from Guernsey. They had three sons and two daughters, of whom Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1 April 1653), Elizabeth, and Ann survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>Simon became a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company on 12 June 1646: his first apprentice was his brother Laurence. From that time he produced portrait medals of eminent contemporaries, often working in collaboration with his brother Abraham, who produced many of the wax models from which they were cast. Examples include <span class="italic">Sir James Harrington</span> (1653), <span class="italic">John Thurloe</span> (1653; British Museum), and <span class="italic">Edward Hyde, First Earl of Clarendon</span> (1662).<br>
<br>Wade died in 1648 and, in the appointments that followed the execution of Charles I, Simon was appointed chief engraver. He engraved a great seal bearing the arms of the Commonwealth, but the haste in which it was required is evident in the artistry. His second great seal of the Commonwealth produced in 1651 was of much greater complexity and of magnificent craftsmanship. In 1650 the committee of the army sent Simon to Edinburgh to sketch Oliver Cromwell for the medal to commemorate the battle of Dunbar. The lord-general in his reply declared that his own portrait should not appear: gratitude to the army might better be expressed by having &#145;Parliament on one side, and on the other an Army.&#146; In the same letter Cromwell asked the committee to confer upon Simon &#145;the imployment in your service which Nicholas Briott had before him, indeed the man is ingenious and worthie of encouragement&#146;  (Farquhar, &#145;Thomas Simon&#146;, 274). On 27 November 1656 Simon was ordered by the council at Whitehall to produce portrait coinage of Oliver Cromwell, for 5<i>s</i>. in silver and 20<i>s</i>. in gold&#151;the obverse showing the protector in profile and of bust length, and the reverse showing the heraldic arms of the Cromwell family. These were struck on the newly designed mill and screw press of Pierre Blondeau.<br>
<br>Simon made many seals for the public service, including, in 1655&#150;6, the great seals for Scotland and for Ireland, and seals for the English, Scottish, and Irish councils, the English law courts, and the admiralty. On 14 January 1657 he laid before the council his account for making medals, badges, silver boxes for treaties, and presses for seals amounting to &pound;1728 5<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. In the following year he was still asking that the debt be honoured. &#145;I beg you&#146;, he writes, &#145;to consider that I and my servants have wrought five years without recompense, and that the interest I have to pay for gold and silver eats up my profit.&#146; In 1658 he was employed to model the face of the effigy of Cromwell, carried in the protector's funeral procession on 23 November 1658.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Simon petitioned Charles II &#145;for the employment as Chief Engraver to His Majesty and the Mint &hellip; and for Pardon because by order of Parliament he made their Seal in 1643.&#146; He was refused, as the title was restored to Thomas Rawlins, who had held it under Charles I. None the less, it was Simon who was instructed to prepare the patterns for the new coinage of 1660. On 31 May 1661 he obtained the grant of the office of one of the gravers of the king's arms, shields, and stamps; and on 2 June 1661 he was made by patent one of the king's chief gravers of the mint and seals, with the salary of &pound;50. At this time he prepared the great privy seal, the great seal of Ireland, the great seal of Jamaica, and seals for the Order of the Garter, the lord high admiral, the council in the marches of Wales, and the Royal Society. In 1661 he visited Paris on official business of the mint.<br>
<br>In January 1662 Simon and John Roettiers were ordered to engrave dies for the new &#145;milled&#146; coinage. However, they could not agree &#145;by reason of a contest in art between them&#146;  (Farquhar, &#145;Thomas Simon&#146;, 297), and so on 7 February they were each instructed to submit to the king a trial piece for a silver crown. Charles decided in favour of Roettiers. The following year Simon engraved the Petition Crown, so called because of its two-line edge inscription: &#145;Thomas Simon most humbly prays your Majesty to compare that his tryll piece with the Dutch and if more truly drawn and embossed more gracefully ordered and more accurately engraven to relieve him&#146;  (ibid., 298). This was a magnificent example of Simon's abilities, but his petition went unheeded. A specimen is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the king continued during 1662 to employ Simon as &#145;one of Our Cheife Gravers&#146;. He was granted warrants to make the great seal of Charles II and the seal of the court of exchequer; on 25 August the king's silver and gold coinage; on 18 September an angel golde showing St George slaying the dragon and, on the reverse, a man-of-war; and the Scottish coinage, of which only two silver coins were completed. His last known work is the dominion of the seas medal commemorating the English naval victory over the Dutch in June 1665. He died, possibly of the plague, that same year and was buried on 26 July at the parish church of All Saints, Maidstone, Kent. His body was probably later reinterred at St Clement Danes, in accordance with his will, proved on 23 August 1665. He left his son, Samuel, a farm at Shorne, Kent, together with paintings, drawings, and medals. To his nephew William, the son of his brother Nathaniel (deceased), he left his punches and graving tools. Simon's widow petitioned the king about 1669 for the sum of &pound;2164, claimed by her as arrears of payment due to her husband.<br>
<br>Simon's outstanding achievement was to bring together exquisite artistry and technology at the mint: this received national recognition in 1753, when the publisher Vertue was instructed by act of parliament to produce a major account of his work. Simon's sketchbooks containing figure, portrait, and animal studies, and the designs for his seals and coinage, which passed into the possession of his daughter Mrs Hibberd, were sold at Christies, London, on 14 July 1987.<br>
