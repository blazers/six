<span class="headword">Marten, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1561&#150;1641), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and judge</span>, was the eldest son of Anthony Marten, citizen and grocer of London and gentleman of Berkshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Yate of Lydford, Berkshire. Henry was born at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.43), although he was described as of St Michael Bassishaw, London, at the time he entered Oxford University  (ibid.). He was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, where he matriculated as the son of a commoner on 24 November 1581, aged nineteen, and was admitted a fellow the following year. He graduated BCL in 1587, proceeded DCL in 1592, and was admitted a member of the college of advocates (Doctors' Commons) on 16 October 1596. With his wife, Elizabeth (1573/4&#150;1618), whom he married in August or September 1597, he had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18168/', "Henry Marten (1601/2&#150;1680)")</script> and George, and three daughters, Elizabeth, Jane, and Mary.<br>
<br>Marten had a long and distinguished career under the first two Stuarts but like many public officials who served both he found himself somewhat more comfortable with the former than with the latter. His legal career developed with notable speed and success. He had distinguished himself in the profession sufficiently to be invited to participate in the disputations before King James at Oxford in 1605 and three years later made a presentation against the use of prohibitions before the privy council. Perhaps as a consequence of those performances, he was named king's advocate on 3 March 1609. Appointments to a succession of important offices followed in due course: in 1616 he was named chancellor of the diocese of London; in January 1617 he was knighted at Hampton Court and in October that year he was appointed judge of the high court of admiralty; in 1620 he was named to high commission; and in 1624 he was made judge of the prerogative court of Canterbury and dean of the arches. As a civilian he had by 1625 reached the pinnacle of his profession. As James I once remarked to him, he was now &#145;a mighty monarch, in his jurisdictions over land and sea, the living and the dead&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Clearly he had also established a personal rapport and a significant level of trust with James I. The king sent him on a mission to the Palatinate in 1613 to help negotiate the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth to the Elector Frederick. Six years later Marten was asked to serve as a commissioner in the trade negotiations between the English and Dutch East India companies, and his success in securing a treaty no doubt led James to call on him again in 1624 when relations between English and Dutch merchants deteriorated disastrously in the so-called Amboyna Affair. The seemingly unprovoked and senseless massacre of English subjects by principals of the Dutch East India Company created a diplomatic nightmare for James on the eve of England's entry into the Thirty Years' War, when the alliance with the Dutch took on singular importance, and Marten's attempts to finesse the crisis were no doubt of considerable help.<br>
<br>Marten's political career began in 1625 when he was elected to parliament as a member for St Germans, Cornwall&#151;an election he owed to fellow Cornish MP Sir John Eliot. He served again in 1626 (St Germans), 1628 (Oxford University), and in the Short Parliament of 1640 (St Ives). He started in parliament rather inauspiciously by criticizing the duke of Buckingham for his failed &#145;ambassadorship&#146; in Spain the previous year, but his criticism was particular and did not reflect anything like ideological opposition to the crown. Marten can be found days later supporting the king's requests for supply, suggesting, quite logically, that since parliament had pressured the king into the war they were morally obliged to offer him financial support&#151;&#145;let us take heed how we discontent a prince whom we have put into a course of war&#146;  (Gardiner, <span class="italic">Commons Debates</span>, 121&#150;2). In the 1626 parliament Marten again became involved (this time inadvertently) in the parliamentary proceedings against the duke of Buckingham. As judge of the admiralty court he had frequently crossed swords with the duke as lord admiral, and MPs had come to focus on one such incident involving cargo in a French ship called the <i>St Peter</i>. The ship had been taken as prize along with a number of others in September 1625, and its cargo, including nearly &pound;10,000 in gold and silver, had been sequestered on orders from Buckingham. King Charles subsequently ordered the gold and silver to be confiscated to the government's use&#151;ostensibly as contraband&#151;and the remaining goods sold at auction, this without investigation, proper due process, or any decree from the court of admiralty, and over the protests of Marten. In the event the sale did not go forward, the goods were restored, and the ship eventually released, only to be suddenly rearrested a week later on orders from Buckingham when relations with France took a sudden turn for the worse. The matter was eventually resolved, but Buckingham's (and the king's) cavalier treatment of the French vessels and their merchants' interests had provoked retaliation against English merchants in France and the episode was seized upon by the duke's enemies as further evidence of his venality and incompetence. Marten was caught in the middle and was forced to stage a vigorous defence of his own part in the matter in the House of Commons. The episode did little to improve relations between Marten and the lord admiral. The following year Buckingham again attempted to interfere with Marten's deliberation's in the court of admiralty on matters of prize and in so doing provoked a bitter quarrel which led to Marten's resignation. The quarrel was resolved very quickly, but Marten returned to his place only after he had been reassured (albeit implicitly) of his future independence as an officer of the court.<br>
<br>This incident seems to have accentuated Marten's growing concerns about Charles I's government. He took an active role in the 1628 parliament, and while he cannot in fairness be described as an &#145;opposition&#146; MP&#151;he staunchly defended the king's discretionary right to declare martial law&#151;he did play an active and important role in the passage of the petition of right. Together with John Glanvill, a prominent common lawyer, Marten was chosen to draft and present the Commons' objections to the Lords' so-called &#145;saving clause&#146;, a proposed amendment to the petition which reserved to the king the discretionary exercise of his &#145;sovereign power&#146;. Marten's speech in conference on 23 April pointed out the logical inconsistency of the Lords' amendment, suggesting that it contradicted the language of the petition and hopelessly undermined its intent by robbing its specific provisions of any persuasive power&#151;&#145;Sovereign Power&#146;, he claimed, &#145;is a transcending and a high word&#146;  (Levack, 119). His speech certainly contributed to the decision to drop the saving clause and it was later printed for public consumption.<br>
<br>During the years that followed Marten also found himself increasingly at odds with Charles I's religious policies. A confirmed moderate, he often used his position as dean of arches (and, before that, as official of the archdeaconry of Berkshire and as chancellor of the diocese of London) to mitigate the harsh treatment meted out to puritans for religious nonconformity. In 1628 he publicly supported a parliamentary bill which would have prevented prosecution for &#145;gadding to sermons&#146; and claimed that as dean of arches he had in the past assessed damages against prosecuting ordinaries and &#145;would ever do it&#146;  (Levack, 191). He also became the focal point of the notorious controversy surrounding the position of the communion table. In 1633 the parishioners of St Gregory's, London (a peculiar of St Paul's), appealed to the court of arches to overturn the decision of the dean and chapter to remove their communion table to the east end of the church and rail it in &#145;altarwise&#146;. Marten was sympathetic to their position and ordered the table to be returned to the chancel but before he could pronounce sentence the king himself intervened&#151;at the urging of Bishop William Laud&#151;and removed the case for hearing before the privy council. The king eventually declared his support for the ordinaries' decision (and for their authority to determine such matters) and consequently ordered Marten to reverse himself and declare against the parishioners. The incident left Marten embarrassed and clearly out of step with official policy and, perhaps not surprisingly, he was summarily removed as dean of arches later that year when Laud replaced George Abbot as archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>Marten found himself at odds with Laud again in the autumn of 1640 when he appeared before the council to argue against the controversial canons of 1640. His opposition on this occasion had less to do with doctrinal matters than with professional concerns. A number of the new canons were designed to circumscribe the jurisdiction and powers of diocesan chancellors and officials in favour of their bishops. These offices were almost always filled by civilians and Marten, together with Sir John Lambe&#151;ironically his replacement as dean of arches&#151;staged a spirited, if ultimately unsuccessful, defence of their professional class.<br>
<br>Despite these disagreements Marten appears to have remained in good standing with the king. He retained his membership on the high commission until its abolition, and kept his posts in both the prerogative court of Canterbury and in the admiralty until his death in London on 26 September 1641 &#145;in the yeare of his Age 81&#146;  (Ashmole, 1.160). He was generally admired for his professionalism and his integrity, though as with other members of Charles I's administration his behaviour came under intense scrutiny during the Long Parliament. Marten was fined &pound;250 by the House of Lords for his part in the high commission prosecution of Sir Robert Howard, and proceedings in at least a half-dozen other cases in the admiralty were being reviewed in the upper house at the time of his death. Marten was reportedly one of the wealthiest men in Doctors' Commons&#151;he lent the king &pound;3000 in 1639&#151;and he left substantial properties in Berkshire to his eldest son, the future regicide Henry Marten. He was buried at Longworth, Berkshire.<br>
