<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  James, of Dalkeith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1420), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Douglas and his wife, Agnes. His father came from a minor branch of the Douglas kindred, whose importance was raised in the 1330s and 1340s through the activities of James's uncle, William Douglas of Lothian. John Douglas was killed in 1349, and by 1351 James was named as William's heir-male for his lands of Aberdour in Fife and Dalkeith. In return James served as a hostage for his uncle's release from English captivity and returned to Scotland only after William was killed in 1353. His killer, William, first earl of Douglas, proceeded to occupy many of his victim's estates, including Liddesdale and Dalkeith.<br>
<br>Through the 1350s James Douglas was powerless to recover his uncle's lands. His principal connections during this period were with his five brothers and his more distant kinsman, Archibald Douglas, known as the Grim, another associate of William Douglas. It was probably through Archibald that James obtained access to David II's favour. In the early 1360s the king confirmed James's right to Aberdour and other lands of William and granted him holdings in Annandale&#151;minor patronage, but a sign of growing royal support. In 1367 James claimed the lands of Mary, daughter of William Douglas, who had died in childbirth along with her child. Her husband, Robert Erskine, claimed the estates in right of the dead infant, James, as Mary's heir. A judicial duel between the claimants was planned over the lands, and, before this, James was knighted by Archibald Douglas. The king ultimately decided the dispute in James's favour. In late 1369 and early 1370 David II granted James lands near Kinghorn, Fife, and confirmed his rights to Dalkeith and to lands at Buittle in Galloway. These latter rewards reflected David's animosity towards Earl William, who lost these estates, but they were also royal compensation. James had been betrothed to Agnes Dunbar, David's mistress and intended third wife.<br>
<br>Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith was linked to the king's southern allies, Archibald Douglas and George Dunbar, earl of March. On David's death in 1371, James strengthened these bonds. He married Agnes Dunbar and received the lands of Morton in Dumfriesshire, Mordington in Berwickshire, and Whittingham in Haddingtonshire from her sister March. In 1372 he accompanied Archibald on an embassy to France. Tensions with Earl William were eased by James's agreement to become the earl's retainer in 1372, while following the death of Agnes, James's marriage to Egidia (<i>d</i>. before 1406), the widowed sister of Robert II, secured his acceptance in 1378 by the new king, who gave his brother-in-law a series of rights and privileges, including the erection of Dalkeith and other lands into a regality. However, when the earl of Douglas was killed in 1388, James Douglas exploited the crisis. It was his horse that kicked the lieutenant, John, earl of Carrick, precipitating a change of regime; but more directly, James renewed his claims to Liddesdale, and to lands in Eskdale, as heir to William Douglas of Lothian. James occupied these lands and gained limited acceptance of his rights. The next decade saw James seeking to defend these gains both on the royal council and locally, against pressure which may have encouraged James to produce detailed wills in 1390 and 1392. In 1397 a series of attacks led by George Douglas, son of Earl William, devastated James's Lothian estates in an attempt to force him to surrender Liddesdale. In a negotiated settlement, James relinquished Liddesdale but retained his Eskdale lands.<br>
<br>After 1400 Sir James Douglas continued his association with the Black Douglases. When the new earl was captured at Homildon Hill in 1402, Douglas of Dalkeith sent his son and grandson to act as hostages for him and was associated with the earl's servants in border negotiations. He was rewarded by the erection of his lands at Buittle in Galloway into a regality. By the early fifteenth century he was recognized as a major Scottish magnate and was one of a small group who received a letter from James I in 1415. When he died in 1420, in his eighties, of a disease called &#145;le Quhew&#146;, James Douglas had assembled a major collection of southern Scottish estates later valued at 1500 merks, a figure which placed the Douglases of Dalkeith among the richest Scottish barons.<br>
<br>This picture of Dalkeith's wealth is supported by the exceptional survival of Sir James Douglas's records, especially his wills and a rental of his lands. These give a unique picture of the activities, concerns, and tastes of a late fourteenth century Scottish nobleman. The wills of 1390 and 1392, in particular, demonstrate that, far from being backward and uneducated, a Scottish magnate could possess objects of value and learning. For example, Douglas possessed a small library. He owned books of grammar, dialectic, statutes of the realm, and romances. His &#145;best book&#146; was red and embroidered and clasped with fetterlocks. An entry thoughtfully instructing his executors to return those volumes which James had borrowed to their owners, suggests he was a reader and not simply an owner of books. Armour for jousting and war, golden circlets, collars, rings and belts, jewels and fur robes, at least one of which came from Flanders, and relics of the true cross and St Mary Magdalene indicate that James possessed many objects of opulence and luxury. Among the beneficiaries of the will were his immediate family and magnate friends like the earls of Douglas and March. Remembered too were a number of his servants, who received money and gifts. James instructed that all his household servants should be paid their fees up to the day of his death. Religious institutions were also prominent among the beneficiaries. Newbattle Abbey in Edinburghshire, where James wished to be buried alongside his first wife, received money for the repair of the buildings, while the chapel of St Nicholas in Dalkeith was bequeathed a missal, vestments, and money by Douglas. James's patronage of the chapel culminated in 1406 with its erection into a collegiate church. By founding the college James was following a growing trend among Scottish lords.<br>
<br>The rental, drawn up in 1376&#150;7, is one of only two such documents from this period. It does not include all of James Douglas's estates, only those in Peeblesshire, Dumfriesshire, and Fife, while an extent detailing the lands of Liddesdale, Westerkirk, and Staplegordon in Dumfriesshire was added in the decade after 1388, when these estates were in James's possession. The rental provides unique evidence of local landholding. It records eighty-eight holdings each held by one or more tenants, the vast majority of whom held their lands under twelve-month leases. Such short leases seem to have been a standard feature of Scottish landholding. The value of the lands included in the rental was &pound;483.<br>
<br>Sir James Douglas was succeeded in his estates by his namesake, another <a name="cosubject_54169"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1441)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of his father's marriage to Agnes Dunbar. In 1378 James was betrothed to Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of John, earl of Carrick (later Robert III), and the marriage took place before 1387. Knighted between 1390 and 1392, in 1402 he was captured with the fourth earl of Douglas at the battle of Homildon Hill, and after his own release acted as a hostage for the earl's temporary parole. His second marriage, to Janet, daughter of William Borthwick, some time before 1439, linked James to an Edinburghshire neighbour who was a councillor of the Douglas earl before 1424. However, after his succession to his father's lands, James's links to the Black Douglases diminished. His eldest son, William, died as a hostage for James I's ransom, and his second son, James, was later declared unfit to hold the family's lands. Towards the end of his life James himself may have been under the influence of his ambitious neighbours, the Crichtons. In 1440 he granted William Crichton lands in Dumfriesshire, while within weeks of James's death in early 1441 Janet Borthwick married George Crichton, later earl of Caithness, who laid claim to her lands. She died some time after 1460. Subsequent years would see conflict over the Dalkeith estates between the Crichtons and James's third son, Henry.<br>
