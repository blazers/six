<span class="headword">Lambart,  Charles</span>, first earl of Cavan  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1660), <span class="occ">army officer and landowner</span>, was the eldest son of Oliver Lambart, first Baron Lambart in the Irish peerage (<i>d</i>. 1618), servitor in co. Cavan, and Hester, daughter of Sir William Fleetwood of Carrington Manor in Bedfordshire. He became second Baron Lambart on his father's death between 1 and 10 June 1618 and was given in wardship to his mother on 26 April 1619. The Lambarts were lineally descended from Ralph de Lambart, a soldier of fortune, who fought at Hastings in 1066. Prior to his death Oliver Lambart had sold and mortgaged the lands he had been granted in co. Cavan and elsewhere. However, in the plantation schemes for the province of Leinster in 1622 his son Charles had a grant of 1296 acres in co. Westmeath and King's county. In 1626 and 1628&#150;9 Charles sat in the English House of Commons representing the borough of Bossiney in Cornwall. On 4 November 1634 he spoke for the first time in the Irish House of Lords, where he was to become a leading speaker. He married Jane, daughter of Richard Robartes, Lord Robartes, of Truro, and sister of the first earl of Radnor. They had a large family of whom Richard, the second earl, died a lunatic in the same year as his father. Oliver, their third son, having survived the second son, succeeded to the family estates under the terms of his father's will. The family maintained possession of their estates in Beauparc, Slane, co. Meath, until late in the nineteenth century, thereby living up to the family motto <i>Ut quocunque paratus</i> (&#145;Prepared on every side&#146;).<br>
<br>On 6 March 1627 Lambart was made seneschal for the government of co. Cavan and the town of Kells in co. Meath. The seneschals were established in the mid-sixteenth century in Ireland and the powers of the office included the exercise of martial law. Although intended to be a temporary expedient, the system continued late into the Tudor century to stabilize Gaelic lordships until conventional sheriffs could be appointed. Lambart's military expertise was recognized when he took over Lord Moore's infantry company on 17 May 1628. He was not, however, a provident estate manager, for in 1633 he conveyed various manors around Carrick in co. Westmeath, and Crover and Mountnugent in co. Cavan&#151;a few of his father's inheritances&#151;to a Richard Nugent. The Lambart estates suffered much on the outbreak of the 1641 Ulster rising.<br>
<br>In the Irish House of Lords Lambart played a prominent part in pressing home the attack for the impeachment of Wentworth. This was a courageous action because the Irish lords were predominantly Old English. Lambart was particularly vocal on the side of the New English to back up the English House of Commons in the attack on Wentworth. His speeches in the House of Lords and his letters indicate a forthright temperament and a just and fair man devoted to the public good. His support was important constitutionally because under Poynings' law (1494) the Irish parliament could claim the right of impeachment only by claiming that English precedents were legally binding in Ireland. Wentworth had used that ancient law as a weapon against the legislature in his tyrannical government of Ireland.<br>
<br>When the Ulster rising of 1641 threatened to engulf the entire country Ormond ordered Lambart to raise a regiment of foot, one of three such regiments, in November 1641. Many of his recruits were refugees from Ulster, and Richard Lambart, his brother, was appointed to a captaincy. Lambart's diplomatic skills were also now recognized when the government chose him as one of the commissioners to negotiate peace with the Ulster rebels. Their efforts failed. In the ensuing warfare that preceded Oliver Cromwell's descent on Ireland, Lambart distinguished himself as a military commander. When Sir Charles Coote left Dublin in 1642 Lambart became military governor of the city, and on receipt of the news of Coote's death he was confirmed in that post by order of council of 12 May 1642. At the same time he was appointed a privy councillor. In February 1643 he aided Ormond in the rout of the rebels at Kilsallaghan, 8 miles north of Dublin near Swords. By May 1643 his cavalry incursions into the south Dublin suburbs at Dean's Grange, Carrickmines, and north Wicklow cleared the Dublin environs of rebel activity. In the disposition of his troops for the defence of the city, Lambart's men were stationed in the streets surrounding the castle&#151;especially in Francis, Thomas, and Patrick streets. As a commander, Lambart inevitably clashed with the civil authorities because he often rode roughshod over the dictates of the common law in precipitate military procedures.<br>
<br>Charles I sent Edward Somerset, earl of Glamorgan, as his personal envoy to Dublin to assist Ormond, but more immediately to get troops sent into England to aid the king as quickly as possible. The northern confederates distrusted Glamorgan; so too did Ormond, who had him arrested in December 1645 six months after his arrival in Ireland. Lambart then became involved in the examination of Glamorgan and may have helped to procure his release in January 1646. Throughout Ormond's peace efforts in 1646 Lambart supported him. He pointed out to him that those opposed to peace were planning an attack on Kilkenny, where the supreme council held its sessions, &#145;to keep moderate and well affected men from attending the assembly&#146;  (J. Lowe, ed., <span class="italic">Clanricarde Letter Book</span>, 1983, 342). He was made earl of Cavan and Viscount Kilcoursie in April 1647, but under the parliamentary army control of Ireland the royalist earl of Cavan was reduced to straitened circumstances.<br>
<br>For the last decade of his life Cavan seems to have lived in comparative obscurity. He got a lease of the manors of Clontarf and Arlaine with a pension of 30<i>s</i>. a week for himself and &pound;1 for his wife, who died in 1655. Cavan died on 25 June 1660, in Dublin, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.<br>
