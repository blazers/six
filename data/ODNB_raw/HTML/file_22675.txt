<span class="headword">Pownall,  Robert</span>  (1520&#150;1571), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and translator</span>, was born in Dorset, not Somerset as formerly believed&#151;a detail furnished by his signature on the list of English exiles at Aarau. Little is known of his life and career before the reign of Mary. He fled abroad as a student, but soon achieved a certain prominence through his activities in several exile centres. On reaching the continent he settled first in Calais: in 1557 he penned to his former fellow citizens <span class="italic">An Admonition to the Town of Calais</span>  (<span class="italic">STC, 1475&#150;1640</span> 19078) threatening them with plagues such as had afflicted Israel in the time of Jezebel:<blockquote>When as I call to remembrance how many wayes God hath sought to induce thee to repentance, &hellip; and on the other side thine indurate rebellion in following in the footsteps of thy mother England, I cannot but with tears lament thyne emynent destruction. (sig. A1<i>r</i>)</blockquote>But Calais, at this time still under English rule, was hardly a safe haven, and by 1556 Pownall had moved on to Wesel, a small German Rhineland town which had already earned a reputation as a hospitable place of safety for religious exiles. Now a considerable colony of English gathered in the city, and the young Pownall soon found himself raised to a leadership role. The first ministers of the church were Miles Coverdale and William Barlow, both former bishops, but this notwithstanding the Wesel church adopted a church order modelled not on the Edwardian prayer book but on John &agrave; Lasco's <span class="italic">Forma ac ratio</span>, the church order of the Edwardian London stranger churches. Barlow as minister was assisted by two &#145;adiutors&#146; or under-ministers, seven elders, and two deacons; Pownall was named among the elders.<br>
<br>Alongside his duties in the management of the congregation, Pownall's most signal service during his time in Wesel came in the form of his writings and translations. During these years a concerted effort was made to make Wesel, alongside Emden, one of the two centres of production for vernacular protestant propaganda aimed at those left behind in England. Its strategic location on Europe's principal artery of trade in one respect made it well suited for this task, although, like Emden, there was no previous tradition of printing within the city. Unlike Emden, the exile community did not number among its members veterans of the London printing trade, and were therefore forced to rely on local men with little previous experience of English-language work. These Wesel editions tend to be of a more rudimentary appearance than the accomplished Emden work; nevertheless, the exiles managed to bring some twenty editions to the market during the course of little over two years. To this Pownall contributed four significant works: the <span class="italic">Admonition to Calais</span> and three translations from the French. Of these, the most substantial was an edition (1555) of Wolfgang Musculus's famous work, <span class="italic">The Temporiser</span>, first translated into French from the original Latin by Val&eacute;rand Poullain, minister of the French church in Frankfurt and a fellow refugee from England. This was a work entirely typical of this phase of the exile, an admonition to those true Christians who had remained behind in England to abandon their temporizing or &#145;Nicodemism&#146; and join the exodus abroad. In an introductory epistle Pownall attempted to fathom what had brought about such a transformation in England, &#145;where worthy Magistrates, nobility and rulers turned into faint hearted persons &hellip; and thy infinite number of gospellers and faithful Christians, into dissembling hypocrites and hollow-hearted persons&#146;  (sig. A4). In his perplexity Pownall spoke for many of the exiles, but he had little to propose but admonition to rejoin the right path: &#145;Wo worth those oxen, that farme, that wife, or any other worldly pleasure, that shall stay us from coming to that celestial supper&#146;  (sig. A7).<br>
<br>Pownall also translated from the French two further works in the same vein: <span class="italic">A most Pithy and Excellent Epistle to Animate All Trew Christians unto the Cross of Christ</span> (1556) and the <span class="italic">Little Dialogue of the Consolator</span> of Pierre du Val, minister of the French church in Emden. Where Pownall learned his French is unknown, possibly even in his short stay in Calais (in the <span class="italic">Admonition</span> he refers to Calais as &#145;thow towne of myne education&#146;), but there was also a sizeable French exile congregation in Wesel. The fact that Pownall chose for translation works of du Val and Poullain, ministers of the French churches in Emden and Frankfurt respectively, is an indication of the close communication between the various exile groups.<br>
<br>Wesel proved ultimately an unhappy refuge for the English and French exile congregations. The Lutheran town council soon appeared to regret the privileges they had extended and, as relations deteriorated, members of the congregation began to look for a new place of refuge. In the summer of 1557 the bulk of the congregation migrated in a body to Aarau, in the Swiss confederation. Here Pownall was appointed one of the ministers of the church under Thomas Lever, whom he had earlier accompanied on a visit to the English community in Geneva. He had by this time married and had three children, one of whom died in Aarau. On 5 October 1557 Pownall and seven of his companions wrote to Heinrich Bullinger, thanking him for the dedication of a volume of his writings to the dispersed English congregations. On 16 January 1559, after the death of Mary, he again joined his companions in a letter to the English church of Geneva accepting their proposition that all English exiles should adopt a uniform attitude on disputed ceremonies.<br>
<br>After the accession of Elizabeth, Pownall returned to England, and was ordained priest by Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, on 1 May 1560. Perhaps surprisingly in view of his distinguished service in exile, Pownall's name never features among those discussed for high office in the new church, notwithstanding his willing conformity. On 31 January 1563 he subscribed the newly prepared <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and from 1562 until his death he was rector of Harbledown in the Kentish hundred of Westgate. In 1570 he was one of the six preachers of the cathedral church of Canterbury. He died in the following year, having asked in his will for burial in the cathedral, next to the vehemently protestant antiquary John Bale, another of the six preachers, who had died in 1563. Pownall's widow was given a life pension by the cathedral authorities.<br>
