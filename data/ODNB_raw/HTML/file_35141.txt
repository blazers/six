<span class="headword">Muir,  Edwin</span>  (1887&#150;1959), <span class="occ">poet and literary critic</span>, was born on 15 May 1887 at The Folly, Ayre, on the Orkney mainland, the youngest of six children of James Muir (1833&#150;1902), farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Cormack (1843&#150;1907). Two years later the family moved to the Bu, a 100 acre farm on the small island of Wyre, where there was a strong sense of community among its few families. Edwin also felt a larger unity&#151;between the human community and the animals and the natural surroundings. In his home the evenings were filled with story-telling and singing. When he was eight the family moved to Garth, another 100 acre&#151;but less good&#151;farm, 4 miles from Kirkwall, on the mainland. He went irregularly to Kirkwall burgh school and began to read voraciously. When he was fourteen the family moved to Glasgow&#151;a sudden transition from a pre-industrial community into the modern world. His father and his second brother, Willie (1877&#150;1902), died within a month of each other. His mother then died three months after his third brother, Johnnie (1879&#150;1906). Muir worked as an office boy in a law office and then in a publishing office; in a beer-bottling firm in Glasgow; and from 1903 to 1914 as a clerk in a bone factory in Greenock. He then returned to Glasgow and worked in a shipbuilding office in Renfrew during the war, having been rejected by the army as physically unfit. As a boy he had experienced two conversions at revivalist meetings but his early religious faith was undermined by what he saw in the slums and by the deaths of his brothers, and was replaced by faith in socialism and later by Nietzscheanism, two philosophies which he desperately tried to reconcile. He was a member of the Clarion scouts, of the Independent Labour Party, and of the guild socialist movement. He contributed to the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, from 1913, propagandist verses and, later, aphorisms in the manner of Nietzsche, which were collected in <span class="italic">We Moderns</span> (1918).<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49250/', "Willa Muir, n&#233;e Wilhelmina Johnston Anderson (1890&#150;1970)")</script>, remembered Muir at their first meeting in 1918:<blockquote>[his] eyes and mouth promised well; his brow was an intellectual's, disproportionately wide and high, very noticeable above the slight, even meagre body, yet his eyes were dreamy looking, sea-blue, with a hint of distance in them, and his mouth was well cut, with full, sensitive lips. (W. Muir, <span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 15)</blockquote>On 7 June 1919 they married: &#145;My marriage&#146;, said Muir, &#145;was the most fortunate event of my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 147). He left Glasgow for London, where he became assistant to A. R. Orage on the <span class="italic">New Age</span> and reviewed for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and (drama) for <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>. The unhappiness of the Glasgow years had brought him close to nervous breakdown and he underwent a course of psychoanalysis. The analysis, more congenial work, and especially Willa Muir helped him to find inner peace in the years that followed, in Prague, Germany, Italy, and Austria (1921&#150;4). Aged thirty-five he began to write poetry seriously, his <span class="italic">First Poems</span> (1925) being published by the Hogarth Press.<br>
<br>In Montrose and Buckinghamshire (1924&#150;5), France (1926&#150;7), Surrey (1927&#150;9), Sussex (1929&#150;32), Hampstead (1932&#150;5), and St Andrews (1935&#150;42) Muir made his living by voluminous work as a critic and reviewer; he also wrote three novels, <span class="italic">The Marionette</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Three Brothers</span> (1931), and&#151;possibly the most successful&#151;the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Poor Tom</span> (1932). Muir shared with Willa a dislike of Calvinism, which was confirmed for him by working on his <span class="italic">John Knox: Portrait of a Calvinist</span> (1929). He and Willa also had mixed feelings about Scotland, some of which were expressed in his <span class="italic">Scottish Journey</span> (1935), and even more so in <span class="italic">Scott and Scotland: the Predicament of the Scottish Writer</span> (1936), where his criticism of Scottish literature and doubts about the viability of Scots as a language for intellectual thought led to the ending of his friendship with C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid). His torn feelings about being Scottish and a writer had already been expressed in 1931 to James Whyte, editor of the <span class="italic">Modern Scot</span> (to which both Muirs contributed): &#145;we are neither quite Scottish &hellip; nor are we quite delivered from our Scottishness &hellip; The very words &#147;a Scottish writer&#148; have a slightly unnerving ring to me; what they come down to &hellip; is a writer of Scottish birth&#146; (10 Sept 1931, NL Scot., MS 19703.7; <span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 71). He and Willa Muir, a better linguist who did much of the work, produced about forty volumes of translations, mostly from German authors, including Hermann Broch, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Gerhart Hauptmann; they were particularly known for introducing Franz Kafka's works to the English-speaking world.<br>
<br>Muir's criticism is contained in about a thousand reviews, in numerous articles&#151;some collected in <span class="italic">Latitudes</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Transition: Essays on Contemporary Literature</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">Essays on Literature and Society</span> (1949), and posthumously in <span class="italic">Edwin Muir: Uncollected Scottish Criticism</span> (1982) and <span class="italic">The Truth of Imagination: some Uncollected Reviews and Essays</span> (1988)&#151;in broadcast talks, and in <span class="italic">The Structure of the Novel</span> (1928), <span class="italic">The Present Age, from 1914</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Estate of Poetry</span> (1962), his Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard University. His criticism is marked by scrupulous fairness and independence of judgement; T. S. Eliot thought it &#145;the best of our time&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Jan 1959). In <span class="italic">An Autobiography</span> (1954), a longer version of <span class="italic">The Story &amp; the Fable</span> (1940), an impressionistic narrative as much concerned with dreams and his intellectual development as factual detail, Muir took a more philosophic approach than Willa Muir was to take in <span class="italic">Belonging</span> (1968). His mature prose reflects his character&#151;quiet, lucid, witty without striving for effect. In 1954 he sent three poems to Janet Adam Smith:<blockquote>in doubt and trembling, for I have been writing prose so long, finishing my autobiography, that verse is now awkward to me: one seems to write prose and poetry with different hands, and whether the right or the left is the poetic one is hard to say &hellip; You mustn't think I am unhappy because the poems are; they came from I don't know where.(25 Oct 1954, NL Scot., MS 19703.17; <span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 169)</blockquote>Muir's poetry is generally seen as his great achievement. Coming to the form late (&#145;[initially] I wrote in baffling ignorance, blundering and perpetually making mistakes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 201) he went on maturing to the end, and wrote his best poems when over fifty. He used traditional metres and made no startling innovations in technique, being concerned only to convey his vision clearly and honestly. Beneath the story of his life he saw the fable of man&#151;Eden, the fall, the journey through the labyrinth of time. He made much use of his dreams and of myths, for in them the fable is most clearly seen. In his later poems he was able to relate a widening range of temporal experiences&#151;the Second World War, the communist victory in Prague, fears of atomic war, his marriage&#151;to his perception of an underlying timeless reality. He experienced to the full the doubts and fears characteristic of the twentieth century and came to see the incarnation as the answer to the problems of time and eternity, necessity and freedom; but his poetry embodied vision rather than belief. Immortality was to him a state of being, something immediately experienced. He wrote in 1939 that he had:<blockquote>believed for many years in the immortality of the soul; all my poetry springs from that in one form or another; and belief of that kind means belief in God, though my God is not that of the churches, and I can reconcile myself to no church &hellip; I look upon myself as an anti-Marx socialist; a man who believes that people are immortal souls and that they should bring about on this earth a society fit for immortal souls.(to Sydney Schiff, 16 Jan 1939, BL, Add. MS 52920, fols. 179&#150;80; <span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 107)</blockquote>The apparently simple words in his poems carry a great weight of meaning. The poems themselves are mostly short but are not fragments&#151;all are related to his central vision of the mystery of our common humanity. T. S. Eliot was struck by &#145;the power of his early work&#146; but thought his late work was &#145;the most remarkable&#146;  (Eliot, 10); Willa Muir asked Kathleen Raine, who was to review him in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, not to &#145;forget the sweet, lighter poems he wrote. Eliot, in his desire to present Edwin as an orthodox Christian, overdid, I think, the desolations and the saintliness. Edwin's wine could never be contained in any orthodox creed&#146;  (7 April 1960, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 109). His collected poems, co-edited by Willa Muir, were published in 1960.<br>
<br>From 1942 to 1945 Muir worked for the British Council in Edinburgh, after which he was director of its institutes in Prague (1945&#150;8) and Rome (1949&#150;50), and warden of Newbattle Abbey (1950&#150;55), an adult education college near Edinburgh. After a year as Charles Eliot Norton professor at Harvard (1955&#150;6) he and Willa settled at Swaffham Prior, near Cambridge. He was appointed CBE in 1953 and received honorary degrees from Prague (1947), Edinburgh (1947), Rennes (1949), Leeds (1955), and Cambridge (1958): &#145;He is now five times a doctor&#151;quite enough&#146;  (Willa Muir to Violet Schiff, 1 Nov 1958, BL, Add. MS 52920). He died in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 3 January 1959 and was buried at Swaffham Prior. He left one son, Gavin (1927&#150;1991), and Willa Muir, who died in 1970.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Complete Poems of Edwin Muir</span> was published in 1991. Muir was a man of complete integrity; gentle, unassuming, and vulnerable, but with firm tenacity of purpose; sometimes abstracted, but strongly affectionate and quick in sympathy. He spoke in a soft, lilting voice and sang almost in tune.<br>
