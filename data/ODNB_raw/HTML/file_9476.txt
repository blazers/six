<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meath,  saints of</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>400&#150;<em>c.</em>900), <span class="occ">holy men and women who were subjects of a cult within the lands of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill</span>, flourished mainly between the fifth century and the early seventh. The area (the early medieval Brega, Mide, and Tethbae) is approximately represented by the modern counties of Meath, Westmeath, the part of the old co. Dublin north of the Liffey (more recently co. Fingal and the northern part of Dublin itself), co. Longford, and parts of co. Offaly and co. Louth. In the case of saints who had churches both within and without the lands of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, only those who were probably buried within the area are included. The saints can be divided into three groups: early saints, generally associated, often falsely, with St Patrick; those saints who, in the mid- and late sixth century, were the founders of the principal monastic churches of the area; and, finally, the smaller group of seventh-century and later saints. The first group is known from the Patrician material, chiefly T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> in the late seventh century and the tripartite life of St Patrick in the tenth; the main saints of the second group are the subject of lives and are all recorded in the ninth-century martyrologies; those in the third group are usually known only from the martyrologies and the annals (for more on these sources, <i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/51008">Munster,  saints of</a>).<h2>
<a name="Saintsattributedtothefifthandearlysixthcenturies"></a>Saints attributed to the fifth and early sixth centuries</h2>The evidence for the early saints is predominantly from the Patrician texts, beginning with T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>, written in the last quarter of the seventh century, but <a name="cosubject_18521"></a><span class="headword">M&eacute;l</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;early 6th cent.)<span class="occ"></span> of Ardagh (Ardachad) in modern co. Longford, is also a character of some importance in what has been claimed as the earliest life of Brigit, the so-called <span class="italic">Vita prima</span>, and in her mainly vernacular life, <span class="italic">Bethu Brigte</span>. The heirs of these saints, Patrick and Brigit, were competing for influence within the kingdom of southern Tethbae; Ardagh was the episcopal church of southern Tethbae, and the competition naturally centred on the principal church of the kingdom. Although there is no life of M&eacute;l, his cult seems to have been resilient. In the ninth century his feast day, 6 February, is recorded in the martyrology of Tallaght, and also in the text of the <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>: the <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire</span> chose the most important saints to include within its brief verses, one to each day of the year, and it is thus significant that the Irish saint chosen for 6 February was M&eacute;l. The connection between M&eacute;l and Patrick seems to have strengthened in the viking period: according to the saints' genealogies, his mother, Dar Erca, was Patrick's sister.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64425"></a><span class="headword">Lomm&aacute;n mac Dall&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;early 6th cent.) of Trim, whose feast day was celebrated on 17 February, but also on 11 October, is one of the clearest cases of an early British saint being drawn into a subordinate position within the cult of St Patrick. This appears to have happened for reasons of dynastic politics within the kingdom ruled by the dynasty of Cen&eacute;l L&oacute;egairi, in which Trim was the principal church. Up to the early eighth century, the church of Trim belonged to a cadet branch of the dynasty; in the early eighth century, however, their position came under threat from the ruling branch. The subjection of Lomm&aacute;n, the patron saint of the church, to St Patrick first appears at that date, in a text included in the <span class="roman">Book of Armagh</span>; it seems to have been a defensive measure by the cadet branch, seeking to gain the influence of Armagh in order to defend its control. The text also asserts that Lomm&aacute;n was related through his mother, not just to Patrick, but to a string of minor local saints across Meath and into Connacht, all of presumed fifth-century date, including <a name="cosubject_64426"></a><span class="headword">Munis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.?), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, &#145;in Forgnaide among the Cuircne&#146;, that is, buried at Forgney in the modern barony of Kilkenny West, Westmeath (feast day 18 December), and <a name="cosubject_64427"></a><span class="headword">Mo Gen&oacute;c</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.?) in Cell Dumai Glinn in southern Brega (Kilglinn, Meath; feast day 26 December). Although the manoeuvre failed to defend the cadet branch of Cen&eacute;l L&oacute;egairi, in that the ruling branch took control of Trim, the subordination of Lomm&aacute;n to Patrick is still there in the tenth-century tripartite life of Patrick. Once this hagiographical weapon had been given to Armagh, it was retained for possible use.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_4343"></a><span class="headword">Cairnech</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;early 6th cent.) of Dulane (Tul&eacute;n, or Tuili&aacute;n), Meath, another early saint of probable British origin, is with little doubt identical with the British saint, Carannog (Carantocus). They have the same feast day, 16 May, and the first life of the latter explicitly identifies the two saying that &#145;he changed his name in their [the Irish] language to Cernach&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vita prima</span>, ed. Wade-Evans, chap. 2). It also admits that Carannog was buried in his chief Irish monastery. On the other hand, the first life's understanding of the geography of Cairnech's Irish cult is limited: it plainly thinks that he was primarily a Leinster saint, probably being led astray by the proximity of Leinster to Ceredigion in Wales, where the life appears to have been written. In one of the notes to the <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span> he was said to be of the Cornishmen, but the Welsh lives associate him with Ceredig ap Cunedda, the eponymous founder of the kingdom of Ceredigion. They thus connect him with his principal Welsh church at Llangranog, Cardiganshire; on the other hand, the first life also makes him the saint of Carhampton, 3 miles south-east of Minehead in Somerset, although it fails to mention Crantock (from &#145;Carantoc&#146;), just to the west of Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall. The <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso</span>'s notion that Carannog was a Cornishman may stem from some link between Ireland and Crantock. In Brittany a parish in Finist&egrave;re was dedicated to Carantec; so also Tregarantec in L&eacute;on. The cult was, therefore, widespread by the twelfth century, the latest possible date for the Welsh life and the date also of the Irish saga of the triple death of Muirchertach mac Erca, king of Tara, in which Cairnech is a principal character (<span class="italic">Aided Muirchertaig meic Erca</span>). It is likely that this saga was written at Cairnech's main Irish church, Dulane.<br>
<br>Cairnech was already, however, a saint of some importance in Ireland by the ninth century. In the later, probably ninth-century, prologue to the <span class="italic">Senchas M&aacute;r</span>, the principal early Irish law book, it was claimed that a panel of bishops, poets, and lawyers compiled the book; the three bishops were Patrick, his successor, Ben&eacute;n, and Cairnech. The origins of Cairnech's role as lawgiver may perhaps lie in local ecclesiastical rivalries. At much the same period, another Patrician text, the tripartite life, claimed that <a name="cosubject_64428"></a><span class="headword">Erc mac Dega</span>  (<em>d.</em> 513), the patron saint of Slane (about 12 miles east and a little south of Dulane), whose feast day was 2 November, was Patrick's judge. The ninth-century collection of monastic anecdotes about C&eacute;ili D&eacute; reformers known as &#145;The monastery of Tallaght&#146; mentions Slane as a particularly, even discreditably, wealthy church. Erc's, and thus Slane's, connection with Patrick and Armagh goes back at least to the late seventh century, so that Dulane may have been making an attempt in the ninth century to supplant Slane as an ally of Armagh. Such a policy might have something to do with the construction, at the beginning of the ninth century, of the new Columban monastery of Kells, only 2 miles to the south of Dulane. As Kells enjoyed the favour of the kings of Mide (Meath), so Dulane might be led to look with hope at the rival power of Armagh. A possible corollary may be that Dulane was where the later prologue was composed.<br>
<br>Both Dulane and Slane lay within the immediate territories of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill rulers of Brega (the eastern part of modern Meath), namely S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine. Duleek, however, the church of <a name="cosubject_64429"></a><span class="headword">Cian&aacute;n mac S&eacute;tnai</span>  (<em>d.</em> 489), although close to Slane, was one of the three principal churches of the Ciannacht Breg, perhaps the most powerful client kingdom within Brega. Cian&aacute;n, whose feast day was 24 November, is attributed to the Ciannachta in the saints' genealogies, a connection suggested by his name (the Ciannachta were thought to be descended from Cian, while Cian&aacute;n means &#145;little Cian&#146;). The tripartite life of St Patrick has Patrick blessing Cian&aacute;n in the northern kingdom of Ciannacht Glinne Geimin (around Dungiven, D&uacute;n Geimin, in modern co. Londonderry), although his church Duleek was in the southern kingdom of Ciannacht Breg. Although the leading saint of Ciannacht Glinne Geimin came to be <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4338/', "Cainnech moccu D&#225;lann")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51008/', "Munster, saints of")</script>], Cian&aacute;n's cult had a minor role in binding together the two Ciannacht kingdoms. His obit in the annals of Ulster is also found in the annals of Tigernach and thus goes back to the chronicle of Ireland, the hypothetical parent text compiled in or soon after 911. It connects him with St Patrick by saying that he received his gospels from the saint of Armagh.<br>
<br>The second major church of the Ciannacht Breg was Monasterboice (Mainister Bu&iacute;te), the monastery of <a name="cosubject_3893"></a><span class="headword">Bu&iacute;te <span class="st"> [Boetius]</span> mac Br&oacute;naig</span>  (<em>d.</em> 519/20), whose feast day was celebrated on 7 December. This lay north of the River Boyne in an area which remained under Ciannacht control even after, in the early eighth century, the territory around Duleek was taken from them by the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill of Brega. A cadet branch of the ruling dynasty of the Ciannacht Breg held the abbacy of Monasterboice for much of the eleventh century and included the important Middle Irish poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9672/', "Flann Mainistrech (Flann of Monasterboice)")</script>. The strength of the church in the post-viking period is also demonstrated by the surviving high crosses. The annals fix Bu&iacute;te's obit by asserting that it occurred in the same year as the birth of St Columba; the information may, therefore, have been part of the Iona annals which seem to have covered the period from the sixth century up to the 740s. His genealogy attributes Bu&iacute;te to the Ciannacht Breg. The Latin life is post-Norman, seeking to associate Bu&iacute;te with Mellifont, the Cistercian monastery founded close to Monasterboice in 1140. Unusually for an Irish saint, there is special mention of the finding of his relics, both in the twelfth-century martyrology of Gorman and also in the Latin life. The first part of the life ends, first, with Bu&iacute;te being taken up to heaven &#145;like a second Elijah&#146; on 1 May  (Plummer, <span class="italic">Vitae sanctorum Hiberniae</span>, vol. 1), then being returned to earth after unusual divine attention had been paid to the complaints of the brethren; finally, the saint died on 7 December having thus been enabled to live to see and declare the day on which Columba was born. The life further claims, via prophecy on the part of Bu&iacute;te, that, thirty years after Bu&iacute;te died, Columba came to Monasterboice, revealed the site of the saint's burial and prescribed the bounds of the cemetery. The life's version suggests, therefore, that the saint's body remained buried in the cemetery but was indicated by some sign. The treatment would thus be the same as that accorded to Columba himself in the time of Adomn&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 704) and would not reflect the growing practice of elevation and enshrinement found in the eighth century. It is possible that the appearance of a second feast day, 16 May, in the martyrology of Tallaght, may indicate that a form of this story was already current in the ninth century, even though the days do not agree (1 and 16 May).<br>
<br>The third principal church of Ciannacht Breg was Lusk, north-east of Dublin, said to be the episcopal see of <a name="cosubject_64430"></a><span class="headword">Mac Cuilinn mac Cathmoga</span> <span class="st"> [Maculinus, Cuindid]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 496). He himself is given a Ciannacht pedigree in the genealogies of the saints; moreover, the close identification of church and dynasty is indicated by the consequences of the loss of royal status by the local branch of the Ciannachta in the early eighth century: they reinvented themselves as the kindred controlling the church of Lusk. The amenities of Mac Cuilinn's feast day (6 September) appear to have included horse-racing, since in 800 a king of southern Brega was thrown from his horse in a race on the feast day and died immediately. The only life of Mac Cuilinn to survive was described by Charles Plummer (<i>d</i>. 1927) as an impudent forgery, having been lifted from a life of Finnbarr.<br>
<br>The cults of the Ciannacht saints may sometimes, as in the case of Lusk, have gained in significance from the decline of local dynasties. They offer a striking contrast with the cults of the saints associated with churches closer to the centres of royal power among the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill themselves. It is broadly true of the midlands that the greatest churches were to be found in the minor kingdoms. The exception is Kells, and that church was not founded until the early ninth century, after the first viking attacks on Iona. The principal &#145;seat of kingship&#146; among the rulers of southern Brega in the eighth and ninth centuries, one of whom suffered the unfortunate riding accident on 6 September 800, was the crann&oacute;g&#151;or lake-fort&#151;of Lagore. Three churches were ringed around this royal seat: the old church of Domnach Sechnaill (Dunshaughlin), 2 miles to the west; Tre&oacute;it (Trevet), just over 2 miles to the north-west; and Cell Fhoibrig (Kilbrew), just over 2 miles to the north-east. None of these churches was insignificant: bishops and scholars are recorded for Trevet in the eighth century and for Kilbrew in the ninth, while an obit of an abbot of Domnach Sechnaill is recorded in 833. Yet their cults were relatively weak: no saint was attributed to Cell Fhoibrig in the martyrologies; <a name="cosubject_64431"></a><span class="headword">Lon&aacute;n mac Talmaig</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th&#150;6th cent.) of Trevet, whose feast day was 1 November, is said to have been of British descent on his mother's side, but there is no surviving paternal pedigree and no life. Domnach Sechnaill may well have been the principal early church of the region, as suggested by the term <i>domnach</i>, borrowed from the early Latin word for a church, <i>dominicum</i>; its saint, <a name="cosubject_64432"></a><span class="headword">Sechnall mac Restiti&uacute;it</span> <span class="st"> [Secundinus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.), bishop, whose feast day was celebrated on 27 November, was said by the tenth century to be the son of Restitutus and Culmana, who was identified as one of Patrick's sisters. Sechnall was of secure reputation as one of the principal episcopal assistants of St Patrick. Yet the only surviving life was copied in the seventeenth century from a humanist compilation in the possession of an Irish Jesuit exile, Henry FitzSimon. This contained some plausibly medieval material, but nothing to demonstrate an especially active cult. It is likely that Sechnall's connection with Patrick was created by the development of the Patrician legend; he may have been the principal bishop of the northern province of what, in the fifth century, was still a greater Leinster including most of Brega; and, if he was anyone's assistant, he was more likely to have been Palladius's rather than Patrick's. His cult, therefore, may have been damaged by being made dependent on that of Patrick, and yet, given his new role as Patrick's lieutenant, his cult was never likely to decline beyond that of a second-rank local saint.<br>
<br>Sechnall may be contrasted with <a name="cosubject_64433"></a><span class="headword">Mochtae <span class="st"> [Mauchteus]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 535) of Louth, whose feast day was 24 March. He was always considered to be both a Briton and a disciple of St Patrick, as in Adomn&aacute;n's second preface to his life of St Columba. The annals of Ulster, in his obit s.a. 535, quote the beginning of a letter purporting to have been written by him, in which he describes himself as &#145;Mauchteus, a sinner, priest, disciple of the holy Patrick&#146;; and there is a reasonable chance that the letter is genuine, given the relationship between Mochtae and Columba disclosed by Adomn&aacute;n and the Iona provenance of the early annals. There is an apparently abbreviated life preserved in the part of <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span> that contains a string of lives of northern saints for August and September, arranged in the order of their feast days. The church of Louth was one of the principal churches of the client kingdom of Conailli Muirthemne; it was sometimes linked to Slane, and even to Lusk, by joint abbacies; and it may have been the Irish monastery of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10252/', "Fursa")</script> of P&eacute;ronne.<h2>
<a name="ThemajorchurchesofthesouthernUNill"></a>The major churches of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill</h2>The most important churches of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill were, however, strung out along their southern frontier, from Finglas just north of Dublin to Clonmacnoise on the Shannon. Finglas had three saints in the martyrology of Tallaght, of whom one is of historical importance, <a name="cosubject_64434"></a><span class="headword">Dublitter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 796), abbot, <i>scriba</i> (principal scholar and teacher), and probably also bishop, whose feast day was 15 May. Dublitter was one of the main leaders of the C&eacute;ili D&eacute; reform movement in the late eighth century, a movement given a major impulse by the &#145;assembly of the synods of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and the Leinstermen in the <i>oppidum</i> of Tara, where there were many anchorites and <i>scribae</i>, whose leader was Dublitter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 780). His name, which means &#145;Black Letter&#146;, was evidently a religious name, following a characteristic practice of the C&eacute;ili D&eacute;. He is not included, under that name at least, in the genealogies of the saints.<br>
<br>Clonard lay on the very frontier between Leinster and Mide. Indeed, it may have belonged more to Leinster in the lifetime of its founder, <a name="cosubject_9476"></a><span class="headword">Finni&aacute;n mac Findloga</span> <span class="st"> [Finnio moccu Thelduib, Vinniauus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 549/51), whose feast day is celebrated on 12 December. His pedigree, as given in the genealogies of the saints, attached him to the descendants of Celtchair mac Uithechair, one of the Ulster heroes who provided popular ancestors for saints of uncertain lineage. His obit's ascription of him to a group (what Adomn&aacute;n called a <i>gens</i>) D&aacute;l or Corcu Thelduib is paralleled in the ascription of Bishop Colm&aacute;n moccu Thelduib, abbot of Clonard (<i>d</i>. 654) to the same people. If the Finni&aacute;n of Clonard were merely one local manifestation of the Ulster saint <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50114/', "Findbarr moccu Fiatach")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51011/', "Ulster, saints of")</script>], as has been argued, it would be necessary to suppose that he was called &#145;moccu Thelduib&#146; as a consequence of later connections, illustrated by the obit of Bishop Colm&aacute;n, between Clonard and D&aacute;l Thelduib.<br>
<br>It has been argued that the Latin lives of Finni&aacute;n go back to an Anglo-Norman text, whereas the two, closely related, Irish lives contain material of ninth-century date. The lost Irish life that was the parent of the two surviving versions was apparently written by a Leinsterman and thus stresses the saint's early connections with that province. A corollary of the view that Clonard was originally a Leinster house is that the annal entry recording the violent imposition of his authority over the monastery in 775 by Donnchad mac Domnaill, southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill king of Tara, caused a decisive change of allegiance: from then on Clonard looked to the Cland Cholm&aacute;in kings of Mide. Yet Clonard was already by 775 a house of wide connections and considerable wealth. When, in 788, &#145;Dub d&aacute; Bairenn, abbot of Clonard, visited the <i>paruchia</i> of the land of Munster&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 788), he appears to have been going on a visit round the churches and other property subject to Clonard in Munster. The tripartite life of Patrick mentions a church claimed by Armagh being exchanged by Clonard for other churches belonging to Clonmacnoise: by the ninth century there was a market in minor churches and the great monasteries such as Clonard might seek to rationalize their holdings. In the mid-ninth century, during the reign as king of Tara of the Cland Cholm&aacute;in king M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac M&aacute;ele Ruanaid, Clonard seems to have occupied a position as head of the churches of Meath on a level with the pre-eminence of Armagh among the churches of the north, the kingdoms subject to Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain. At the period, therefore, when the earliest materials detected within the Irish lives may have been written&#151;materials concerned especially with the monastery's property interests in Leinster&#151;Clonard was already firmly part of the Cland Cholm&aacute;in kingdom of Mide. Just as Dub d&aacute; Bairenn's 788 visit to Munster was probably designed to protect the material interests of Clonard in that province, so the hypothetical ninth-century hagiographical material may have played a role in protecting Clonard's rights in Leinster.<br>
<br>The hagiography of Clonard contains two further significant themes: the first is the reputation of Finni&aacute;n as the teacher of many of the most famous Irish saints, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3321/', "Brendan of Clonfert")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51012/', "Connacht, saints of")</script>], <a href="#cosubject_3320">Brendan of Birr [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6001/', "Columba of Iona")</script>. In the last case, at least, there is evidence to suggest that the claim is false, but it does imply the continuing intellectual aspirations of Clonard. If the later ascription of the scholar Ailer&aacute;n (<i>d</i>. 665) to Clonard were correct, it would show that the monastery was already a centre of scholarship in the seventh century. The other major theme is the link between Finni&aacute;n and the Welsh saint <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4306/', "Cadog of Llancarfan")</script> in Glamorgan. The latter's importance for the Irish is suggested by the early life of St Cainnech, where he is mentioned as a teacher of the saint. The late eleventh-century Welsh life of St Cadog itself appeals to the authority of the scholars of Clonard.<br>
<br>Immediately to the west of Clonard, the borderlands between Leinster and Meath were an area in which the cult of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3427/', "St Brigit of Kildare")</script> was solidly entrenched, both in the north-western part of the medieval Leinster kingdom of U&iacute; Fhailgi and in the neighbouring kingdom of Fir Thulach subject to the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. Beyond this cross-frontier extension of the cult of Brigit, further south-west, came two kingdoms dotted with major churches, Cen&eacute;l Fiachach and Delbnae Bethra. Cen&eacute;l Fiachach was a once-powerful branch of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, victim of more successful cousins, while Delbnae Bethra, in the low-lying lands of the River Clodiagh, was a lowly client kingdom. Their fate is demonstrated by the later name of much of the kingdom of Cen&eacute;l Fiachach, T&iacute;r Cell or Fir Chell, &#145;the land [or men] of churches&#146;.<br>
<br>The great saint of Cen&eacute;l Fiachach was <a name="cosubject_50073"></a><span class="headword">&Aacute;ed mac Bricc</span>  (<em>d.</em> 589), bishop, of Rahugh and Killare in the midlands, and Slieve League on the south-west coast of modern co. Donegal, whose feast day was 10 November. The site of the church of Killare, close to the legendary centre of Ireland and of Mide at Uisnech, is an indication of the earlier power of Cen&eacute;l Fiachach. His more important church, however, was Rahugh, a few miles to the east of the Columban monastery of Durrow. In spite of having a neighbouring house which was favoured by the Cland Cholm&aacute;in kings of Mide, Rahugh retained enough importance to be the church of an abbot who was also a bishop, Dub d&aacute; Thuath (<i>d</i>. 788), and to be chosen as the site of a major royal assembly in 859 at which Osraige was alienated to Leth Cuinn (effectively, the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill) by the king of Munster. &Aacute;ed mac Bricc's life in the <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span> is early, probably eighth-century. Its political stance is ambiguous: on the one hand, it presents &Aacute;ed as a peacemaker between Munster and the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and between Mide and Tethbae, befitting his cross-border descent through his mother, Eithne, from the neighbouring Munster people of M&uacute;scraige T&iacute;re (north-west co. Tipperary) and his foundation of a church, Enach Midbren, in their kingdom; it also declares that &#145;kings were always hostile to him and used to be compelled by divine power to be obedient to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vita sanctorum</span>, ed. Heist). However, the life also glosses over &Aacute;ed's descent on his father's side from Fiachu mac N&eacute;ill, ancestor of Cen&eacute;l Fiachach, preferring to say, more generally, that he belonged to the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. That &Aacute;ed mac Bricc was influential among the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill is suggested by his having founded a church by Slieve League in the lands of Cen&eacute;l Conaill in the far north-west. Although the life borrows from Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba, a copy of which may have been obtained from the nearby monastery of Durrow, it is more small-scale in scope: its central concerns are with local violence and with the poverty and insecurity of women, especially nuns, but it also gives &Aacute;ed a special role as a healer of headaches. An episode in the life in which he heals Brigit of headache is echoed in the ninth-century Irish life of Brigit. A stone close to the existing church is still associated with the curing of headaches; it may be the stone mentioned in the Irish life of Brigit in association with &Aacute;ed mac Bricc.<br>
<br>Durrow was probably the burial place of <a name="cosubject_39202"></a><span class="headword">Cormac ua Liath&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.), whose feast day was 21 June. He belonged to the royal kindred of the kingdom of the U&iacute; Liath&aacute;in in the east of modern co. Cork (where Castlelyons is Caisle&aacute;n ua Liath&aacute;in). No life of Cormac survives but he is an important character in Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba. He was included together with three other &#145;holy founders of monasteries&#146;, Comgall moccu Araidi of Bangor, Cainnech moccu Dalonn of Aghaboe, and Brendan of Clonfert, who together visited Columba on the island of &#145;Hinba&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Columba</span>, 3.17), but his best-remembered role was as a navigator, &#145;a holy man who sought with great labour not less than three times a desert in the ocean, and yet found none&#146;  (ibid., 1.6). By Adomn&aacute;n's time, it is quite likely that some of the settlements of Irish monks in the Atlantic (Faeroes and Iceland), recorded by the geographer D&iacute;cuil in the early ninth century, had already been established. Adomn&aacute;n, therefore, may have had good reason to believe that none of the land discovered in the Atlantic was inhabited. One detail given by Adomn&aacute;n, however, raises the question whether Cormac sailed in the same frame of mind. Cormac sailed from Eirros Domno (Erris) beyond the River Moy, namely from the north-western part of Mayo. This included the district in which Patrick lived as a slave, by the &#145;Silva Vocluti&#146;. Moreover, Patrick is likely to have included that district in those lands beyond which there was only the ocean, the western edge of the inhabited world, to which he was proud to have brought the Christian faith, in fulfilment of an eschatological passage in Paul's epistles implying that once the inhabited world had all been evangelized the last Judgment would come. By Cormac's time it would have been apparent that, though Ireland was on the edge of the world, &#145;a pimple upon the face of the world&#146;, as Cummian (possibly Cumm&eacute;ne Fota) was to call it in his letter to S&eacute;g&eacute;ne, abbot of Iona, and B&eacute;cc&aacute;n the anchorite, the last Judgment had not come. Some may well have concluded that there might be inhabited land to the west still unevangelized, land which it was their Christian duty to discover. Cormac, who came from Munster and had no connection with north-western Connacht, may have chosen to sail from Erris, in Mayo, because it was perceived as the western edge of the known world, from which a voyage to discover if there were any more land in the Atlantic might properly begin.<br>
<br>Beyond Durrow, a few miles further south-west, lay Lynally (Lann Elo), the monastery of <a name="cosubject_5974"></a><span class="headword">Colm&aacute;n Elo</span> <span class="st"> [Colm&aacute;n moccu Sailni, Colm&aacute;n mac Beognai]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 611), whose feast day was 26 September. He came from an Ulster people to which the founder of the church of Connor, Mac Nisse, also belonged. Colm&aacute;n himself was described in one of his lives as the second patron of Connor. In his <span class="roman">Salmanticensis</span> life, however, although it is probably eighth-century, it is claimed that he belonged to the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. No doubt this reflects the situation of Lynally within the lands of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, but it is also paralleled by the generalized reference in the life of &Aacute;ed mac Bricc to his descent from Niall. Both churches, under the shadow of the Cland Cholm&aacute;in kings of Meath, were tending to conceal other loyalties. Yet, in spite of the life, Colm&aacute;n's membership of D&aacute;l Sailni, attested in Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba, remained well-known: not only is there the reference in the life of Mac Nisse to his kinship with that saint, but his pedigree in the genealogies of the saints reveals his northern origins and his kinship both with Mac Nisse of Connor and with Sen&aacute;n of L&aacute;thrach Bri&uacute;in, near Maynooth (both also attested by joint abbacies). The claim in the martyrology of Donegal that his mother was M&oacute;r, sister of Columba of Iona, is demonstrably late, since neither Colm&aacute;n nor M&oacute;r is mentioned in the account of Columba's sisters' sons written <i>c</i>.700; presumably it reflects the proximity of Lynally to Durrow and the association with Columba revealed by Adomn&aacute;n, from whose work the life of Colm&aacute;n Elo borrowed incidents. The same concerns governed the account of the foundation of Lynally. According to the life, the decision was taken at an assembly of the kings of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, including &Aacute;ed Sl&aacute;ne of Brega and &Aacute;ed mac Ainmirech of Cen&eacute;l Conaill, Columba's cousin. At this assembly were also present Columba, Cainnech of Aghaboe, and Colm&aacute;n Elo. &Aacute;ed Sl&aacute;ne's gift of land &#145;in the Wood of Ail [<i>Fid Elo</i>]&#146; on his southern frontier was dictated by Columba. Moreover, the site for the monastery was chosen jointly by Colm&aacute;n Elo himself and Columba's disciple Laisr&aacute;n, presumably the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39266/', "Laisr&#233;n or Laisr&#225;n")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51141/', "Iona, abbots of")</script>] of whom Adomn&aacute;n relates that he was the head of Durrow during Columba's lifetime and who was also third abbot of Iona. Otherwise the prevailing theme of the life is Colm&aacute;n Elo's friendship with neighbouring saints, notably <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17166/', "Mo Lua moccu &#211;che")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51008/', "Munster, saints of")</script>], the founder of Clonfertmulloe on the southern side of Slieve Bloom, and with Mo Chutu of Rahan, just over 2 miles to the west of Lynally (see further below). The concentration of major churches within a few miles of each other, with the supply of good land limited by surrounding bogs, determined the concerns of the life.<br>
<br>There is good manuscript evidence in favour of Colm&aacute;n Elo's authorship of the <span class="italic">Apgitir Chr&aacute;baid</span> (&#145;Alphabet of piety&#146;), a vernacular text in verse and prose, both an exceptionally polished piece of writing and one of the central texts within the early Irish tradition of spiritual and moral teaching. If the text is indeed by Colm&aacute;n Elo, he would appear to have deliberately avoided the archaisms of language found in early legal texts, while at the same time employing most of the stylistic artifices, other than archaism, to be found in the laws. It has also been suggested that he may have been the author of the Latin hymn on St Patrick ascribed to Secundinus.<br>
<br>Further south-west, on the southern boundary of the kingdom of Cen&eacute;l Fiachach, was Kinnitty (Cenn Etig), the church of <a name="cosubject_50113"></a><span class="headword">F&iacute;n&aacute;n Cam mac M&oacute;enaig</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th&#150;early 7th cent.), whose feast day is 7 April. Although Kinnitty was on the north side of Slieve Bloom, it was said to have been on the very border between Munster and the lands of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. F&iacute;n&aacute;n Cam himself came from the Corcu Duibne, the ruling group of the Dingle peninsula in west Munster. His mother is named as B&eacute;cnat, daughter of Cian, but it is not said to what kindred she belonged. In the <span class="roman">West Munster Synod</span>, a propaganda text written in west Munster <i>c</i>.800, in which particular saints were so closely identified with their peoples that they could swear on their behalf, F&iacute;n&aacute;n Cam swore allegiance to the alliance on behalf of Corcu Duibne. Like &Aacute;ed mac Bricc and Colm&aacute;n Elo, F&iacute;n&aacute;n Cam was the subject of an early, probably eighth-century, life in the <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span>. The life portrays him as the defender and representative of his people: he protects them from the attacks of the U&iacute; Fhidgeinte (modern co. Limerick) and secures a remission of tribute from Fa&iacute;lbe Flann, king of Munster (<i>d</i>. 637). He was a disciple of Brendan of Clonfert and Ardfert, but it is not made clear whether this was in the southern church, Ardfert, or in Connacht, Clonfert being much closer to Kinnitty, Ardfert to Corcu Duibne. The principal surviving physical testimony to the church of Kinnitty is the high cross, now in the grounds of a hotel.<br>
<br>A distance of 8 miles west of Kinnitty is Birr, the site of the church of <a name="cosubject_3320"></a><span class="headword">Brendan mac Nemainn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 565/73), whose feast day is 29 November, and who was an older contemporary of Brendan of Clonfert. In the <span class="roman">West Munster Synod</span>, Brendan of Birr swore on behalf of the Cuirigi, an exceedingly obscure group of peoples; in a genealogy he is assigned to D&aacute;l nAuluimm to whom Erc of Slane is also assigned. In the genealogies of the saints he is attributed to the widely distributed but politically weak descendants of the Ulster hero, Fergus mac Ro&iacute;ch. No life survives, though apparently a fragmentary text still existed in the seventeenth century. Yet in spite of his undistinguished and uncertain lineage and the lack of a surviving life, Brendan of Birr came to be reckoned in the post-viking period as one of &#145;the twelve apostles of Ireland&#146;. Much earlier, in Adomn&aacute;n's life of Columba, Brendan was the only person to rise up as Columba approached a synod at Tailtiu (Teltown) that was all set to condemn him; Adomn&aacute;n also devoted a chapter to Columba's miraculous perception of the angelic welcome given to Brendan's soul: &#145;in this past night I have seen the sky suddenly opened, and companies of angels coming down to meet the soul of the holy Brendan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Columba</span>, 3.11). The chapter demonstrates that it was the day of death and not the day of burial that was commemorated as the (celestial) birthday of the saint.<br>
<br>North of Birr and Kinnitty lay the three major monasteries of Delbnae Bethra: Rahan, Lemanaghan, and Clonmacnoise. The principal saint of Rahan, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4808/', "Mo Chutu")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51008/', "Munster, saints of")</script>], died at his Munster monastery of Lismore on 14 May 637, having the previous year been expelled from Rahan on account of his paschal views. He was, however, largely to displace an earlier saint, <a name="cosubject_64435"></a><span class="headword">Camulacus</span>  (<em>fl. </em>5th cent.?), who is attested in the late seventh-century <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> of T&iacute;rech&aacute;n and in the hymn in his honour preserved in the antiphonary of Bangor. Camulacus must, on the evidence of his name, have been a Briton, and Rahan thus offers an unusually well-attested example of the submerging of an early cult of a British saint in Ireland. Unless he is the Mo Chamal of 16 May, Camulacus was not included in the martyrologies.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_5413"></a><span class="headword">Ciar&aacute;n mac int Sha&iacute;r</span>  (<em>c.</em>515&#150;548/9) of Clonmacnoise (feast day 9 September), was described as <i>mac int sha&iacute;r</i> (&#145;son of the wright&#146;), but his father's name was B&eacute;o&aacute;n; he came from the Cruithnian people of Latharnae, who gave their name to the modern town of Larne; his mother, Dar Erca, was later said to be Patrick's sister, but this was Patrician propaganda of a familiar kind. The monastery of Clonmacnoise (Cluain Moccu Nois) was founded a year before his death. Its border location on the east bank of the Shannon and the comparatively humble, and distant, situation of the Latharnae were exploited in two directions. First, as with the monastery of Clonfertmulloe in the north of Munster, the abbacy was not attached to any one family. Abbots were recruited from a wide variety of kindreds, so creating links with many kingdoms. Second, Clonmacnoise extended its influence not just in Meath but also, and especially, in Connacht. In the Middle Irish genealogies of the saints, it is said that the Connachta followed Ciar&aacute;n, the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Columba. The acquisition of lordship over Connacht churches by Clonmacnoise was said by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, writing <i>c</i>.690, to have spread in the recent past. The prestige of Clonmacnoise within Connacht is demonstrated by the ecclesiastical edicts, <i>c&aacute;nai</i>, promulgated in the province in the name of Ciar&aacute;n in the eighth century. But the monastery was also patronized by the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and especially by Cland Cholm&aacute;in; the west cross was put up at the expense of a late ninth-century king of Tara, Flann Sinna, who is very probably represented, together with the abbot, on one of its panels.<br>
<br>None of the three Latin and one Irish lives of Ciar&aacute;n is early. They fall into three main sections: first comes the saint's origins and education; then his period at Inis Aingin (Hare Island at the southern end of Lough Ree); and finally his foundation of Clonmacnoise and, only one year later, his death. The first section was mainly designed to buttress alliances between Clonmacnoise and other great churches; Ciar&aacute;n was thus among the pupils of &Eacute;nda of Aran and Finni&aacute;n of Clonard. But the version edited by Charles Plummer, a thirteenth-century reworking of older materials, also reveals a political allegiance. Ciar&aacute;n's father, initially working as a wright in Meath, left that province for Connacht because of the heavy taxes imposed by a king of Tara, Ainmire mac S&eacute;tnai. This early tax exile then established himself in Mag nA&iacute;, where Ciar&aacute;n was born. Ainmire, of Cen&eacute;l Conaill in the north, was not king of Tara until well after Ciar&aacute;n's death. He may have been chosen as a king associated both with Columba of Iona and Durrow, and therefore with the new monastery of Columba at Kells, to make tactfully coded suggestions to Cland Cholm&aacute;in, the royal dynasty of Meath. The implication is, presumably, that the kings of Meath (Cland Cholm&aacute;in) should forbear to impose heavy taxes, or perhaps taxes at all, on Clonmacnoise. The second section is centred on Inis Aingin, his first monastery, situated in Lough Ree (much favoured by monastic founders) and thus between Connacht and Meath. Finally, in the third section, with the foundation of Clonmacnoise, the saint returned to Meath from where his father had been driven by the tax collector.<br>
<br>Plummer rightly noted the sentiments expressed by Ciar&aacute;n before death as unusual for Irish saints. Many of the latter saw their own sanctity from afar, with angels anxious to escort them to heaven. Not so Ciar&aacute;n for whom death was a subject of anxiety about the unknown and trepidation at the judgment of God. It is possible, as Plummer guessed, that this is a fragment of early, unformulaic material which survived into the late medieval text. Much of the matter in the lives, however, had more to do with the history of Clonmacnoise than with Ciar&aacute;n; in placing the saint's birth in Mag nA&iacute;, they were probably seeking to align the monastery with the dominant dynasty of Connacht from the eighth century, the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in A&iacute;.<br>
<br>Ciar&aacute;n's first foundation, Inis Aingin, remained within the jurisdiction of Clonmacnoise to judge by an annal entry recording the profanation and insulting of the island in 899, where a synod was being held, headed by <a name="cosubject_6348"></a><span class="headword">Coirpre Crom mac Feradaig</span>  (<em>d.</em> 904), <span class="occ">bishop of Clonmacnoise</span>, whose feast day was 6 March. A story probably put into circulation by Clonmacnoise declared that this Coirpre, who was himself included in the martyrologies as a saint, had succeeded in bringing to heaven, by dint of prolonged and intense prayer, the soul of M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac M&aacute;ele Ruanaid, king of Tara. Although, therefore, Clonmacnoise flourished by dint of good relations, genuine and fictional, with the most powerful kings of both Meath and Connacht, it also sustained a reputation as the home of holy men and scholars, such as Coirpre and also <a name="cosubject_5838"></a><span class="headword">Colcu ua Duinechda</span>  (<em>d.</em> 796), <i>scriba</i> and probably bishop of Clonmacnoise, whose feast day was 20 February. He has been identified with the Colcu who was Alcuin's correspondent and teacher of Alcuin's pupil, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61650/', "Joseph Scottus")</script>, but this is improbable: Alcuin's friend was evidently resident in England. The martyrology of Donegal ascribes to him &#145;the kind of prayer that is called the Broom of Devotion&#146; (Scuab Cr&aacute;bhaidh), referring to the litanies of Jesus (nos. 4 and 5 in Plummer's <span class="italic">Irish litanies</span>). His inclusion in the martyrology of Tallaght suggests that he was venerated by the C&eacute;ili D&eacute; reformers of the late eighth century, although they had little time for many of the wealthier and more secularized &#145;old churches&#146;; he may, therefore, be the Colcu referred to, in terms of respect, in &#145;The monastery of Tallaght&#146;. Such houses as Clonmacnoise were probably tending to divide between an abbatial administration, set upon defending and expanding the material interests of the monastery, and the <i>scribae</i> (leading scriptural scholars), anchorites, and bishops whose concerns were more spiritual. Yet the split was not complete, for some abbots were also venerated for their religious manner of life and scholarship.<br>
<br>As the most important churches of the midlands were in the client kingdoms to the south of the main lands held by Cland Cholm&aacute;in, so the church of <a name="cosubject_4335"></a><span class="headword">Caill&iacute;n <span class="st"> [Caill&eacute;n]</span> mac Niataig</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.?) lay to the north of the heartlands of Mide, at Fenagh, in modern co. Leitrim. Fenagh is in the drumlin belt, in an area of poor lands and, in the early period, marginal dynasties. Once the area had been conquered by what claimed to be a cadet branch of the U&iacute; Bri&uacute;in of Connacht&#151;a branch that became the &Oacute; Ruairc (O'Rourkes) of Br&eacute;ifne&#151;however, the fortunes of Fenagh and of St Caill&iacute;n improved. The main information comes from the <span class="roman">Book of Fenagh</span>, written in 1516 for the family regarded as the heirs of Caill&iacute;n, the U&iacute; R&oacute;daigh (O'Roddys). Its concern is with the dues and fees paid to Fenagh; stories about Caill&iacute;n serve to justify such claims. His feast day was celebrated on 13 November.<h2>
<a name="Laterfoundations"></a>Later foundations</h2>The saint of Lemanaghan, <a name="cosubject_64436"></a><span class="headword">Manch&aacute;n mac Sill&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 665), whose feast day was 24 January, was not the subject of a life; his church, a late arrival in the kingdom of Delbnae Bethra, was apparently overshadowed by its neighbour to the west, Clonmacnoise. There are only two obits of abbots during the eighth and ninth centuries. On the other hand, there are six early gravestones and there is the twelfth-century tomb-shaped shrine containing Manch&aacute;n's relics, which seems never to have left the district and is preserved in a neighbouring Catholic church at Boher.<br>
<br>Although it is a general rule that the more important churches of Meath lay on its borders, a partial exception is the monastery of Fore, to the north-east of Lough Leane in Westmeath, and within a client kingdom close to the centre of power of the Cland Cholm&aacute;in kings. Fore (Fobar) was the monastery of <a name="cosubject_9244"></a><span class="headword">F&eacute;ch&iacute;n moccu Ch&aacute;e</span> <span class="st"> [Mo Fh&eacute;ccu mac Ca&iacute;lcharna]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 665), whose feast day was 20 January. The genealogies contain rival claims associating him with the Gailenga (of Meath and northern Connacht) and the Fothairt (mainly of Leinster). The latter claim may be connected with his church of L&aacute;thrach Ca&iacute;n, probably one of the places named Laragh in Leinster. The first Irish life (the printed text, from a single fourteenth-century manuscript, is a combination of two earlier lives) associated him with the Luigne of Connacht and, in particular, with the church of Achonry and its patron saint, Nath &Iacute;. Similarly, Fore itself is said to have been within the bounds of the Luigne of Meath. Just as Cian&aacute;n of Duleek linked together the Ciannachta of Brega and of Glenn Geimin, so F&eacute;ch&iacute;n linked together the Luigne of Connacht and Meath. As befitted the saint of an important client kingdom, F&eacute;ch&iacute;n was shown as taking a firm line with over-kings, such as Diarmait mac &Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ne, king of Tara. The second Irish text shows rather more interest in Leinster and provides a story of a usual kind to justify the payment of rents of F&eacute;ch&iacute;n from Leinster. In the Latin and Irish lives his mother was called Lassair; according to the first Irish life, she was of the royal family of Munster. F&eacute;ch&iacute;n also founded a monastery on the island of Omey near Clifden in Connemara, confirming his Connacht connections, but Fore was his principal church and &#145;the place of his resurrection&#146;.<br>
<br>A saint similarly closely identified with a client people was <a name="cosubject_27987"></a><span class="headword">Ult&aacute;n moccu Chonchobair</span>  (<em>d.</em> 657), bishop of D&aacute;l Conchobair (Conchuburnenses) and abbot of Ardbraccan, whose feast day was 4 September. An addition to his pedigree in the genealogies of the saints says that his mother, Collo (Colla) ingen D&iacute;mmai, was of the Gailenga (a neighbouring client kingdom), and thus Ult&aacute;n (that is, Ardbraccan) was entitled to a share of dues from them. In the Rheims prologue of the ninth century, Ult&aacute;n was the first named hagiographer of Brigit, preceding Ailer&aacute;n and Cogitosus. A hymn to Brigit, <span class="italic">Brigit b&eacute; bithmaith</span>, was ascribed to him (the ascription is probably of the eleventh century, and, although almost certainly false, it attests his continuing reputation as a supporter of the cult). He also, however, possessed a book from which T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, in the late seventh century, took his information about the four names of Patrick. The Latin phrase used by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n may imply that Ult&aacute;n was the author of the book. In any case, Ult&aacute;n was certainly an oral source for T&iacute;rech&aacute;n and was also his teacher. Ult&aacute;n is thus important in that he demonstrates that a bishop of a client people within the lands of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill could be concerned with the hagiography of both Patrick and Brigit.<br>
<br>The only important female saint within the lands of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, and also one of the later saints to be given a cult, was <a name="cosubject_64437"></a><span class="headword">Samthann ingen D&iacute;ar&aacute;in</span>  (<em>d.</em> 739) of Clonbroney (Cluain Br&oacute;naig) in the northern Tethbae kingdom of Cen&eacute;l Coirpri, whose feast day was 19 December. Samthann was not the founder of Cluain Br&oacute;naig. In her Latin life that honour is reserved for <a name="cosubject_64438"></a><span class="headword">Funech</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 7th cent.), whose feast day was 11 December. Funech, however, is made responsible for bringing Samthann to Cluain Br&oacute;naig; the suggestion, therefore, is that Cluain Br&oacute;naig was founded in the second half of the seventh century. In the tripartite life of Patrick, however, it was claimed that the founders were two sisters of <a name="cosubject_64439"></a><span class="headword">Guasacht maccu Bu&aacute;in</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 5th cent.), <span class="occ">bishop of Granard</span>, and thus of the kingdom of Cen&eacute;l Coirpri in northern Tethbae to which Cluain Br&oacute;naig belonged, whose feast day was celebrated on 24 January. This is coupled with a claim that the head of the church of Granard had the right to veil all the nuns. There may be some connection, not easy to decipher, between this claim and the pedigree given to Samthann in the genealogies of the saints, namely that she was great-granddaughter of D&iacute;chu mac Trichim, the founder of the ecclesiastical family of Saul in co. Down (Patrick's claimed burial place). Both claims are made within the language of Patrician hagiography, specifically its Ulster branch; the connection with D&iacute;chu is quite impossible chronologically, but what it probably signifies is a rejection of the story in the tripartite life, the latter being favourable to Granard. In the Patrician legend, D&iacute;chu was Patrick's friend while M&iacute;liucc maccu B&oacute;in was his owner when he was a slave and refused to be converted. The pedigree thus aligned Samthann with the church of Saul and with the D&aacute;l Fiatach of co. Down, and was opposed to the kindred of Guasacht maccu Bu&aacute;in of Granard. The pedigree is echoed by the life's assertion that Samthann came from the Ulaid. It neatly gets her to the right part of Ireland by going on to say that her foster father was Crid&aacute;n, king of Cen&eacute;l Coirpri.<br>
<br>The broad lines of her career as a nun are set out in the life. Samthann was given to a man in marriage by her foster father, put up stern resistance, and thus compelled him to accept that she should be betrothed to God. She thereupon entered the monastery of &#145;Airnaide&#146; (perhaps the Urney near Lifford, modern co. Donegal, or the Urney of co. Cavan), where she was in charge of the material sustenance of the monastery. From there she was summoned by Funech to succeed her at Cluain Br&oacute;naig. Perhaps the most striking point made by the life is that Niall mac Fergaile (Niall Frossach), king of Tara (<i>d</i>. 778), was so attached to her memory that he enshrined her staff. Niall was from Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain, while Cluain Br&oacute;naig was within a client kingdom of Cland Cholm&aacute;in of Mide. It suggests that a northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill king of Tara might extend his power in the midlands, not his normal sphere of influence, by patronage of churches.<br>
