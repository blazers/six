<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Linley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Sheridan]</span>,  Elizabeth Ann</span>  (1754&#150;1792), <span class="occ">singer and writer</span>, was born on 5 September (some sources give 4 or 7 September) 1754, probably in her parents' house on Abbey Green, Bath, Somerset, the eldest daughter of the musician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16737/', "Thomas Linley (1733&#150;1795)")</script> and his wife, Mary Johnson (1729&#150;1820). She probably sang in Bath concerts from 1763, and sold tickets for concerts from an early age. After a short stint at a boarding-school in Bristol  (Bor and Clelland, 26) or Wells  (Black, 15), Elizabeth probably made her stage d&eacute;but with her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16736/', "Thomas Linley the younger")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16737/', "Linley, Thomas")</script>] in Thomas Hull's <span class="italic">The Fairy Favour</span> at Covent Garden, London, in 1767. Thomas Linley fully exploited his children's talents: in 1768 Mary Dewes noted that Elizabeth sang in Bath's weekly concerts and that &#145;she has a sweet voice; but he makes her sing <i>too much</i> and <i>too hard</i> songs, for she is very young&#146;  (Delany, 2nd ser., 1.133). Thomas Linley retained tight control over his children's performances in Oxford and London and at the Three Choirs festival: in 1770 he accepted George Colman's contract for a daughter (probably Elizabeth) to sing in the Covent Garden oratorios, but would not let her act there, as he did not &#145;relish giving the prime of my Daughters performance to support the schemes of others&#146;  (Colman, 151).<br>
<br>In 1773, when Elizabeth was at the height of her fame, Frances Burney commented that her voice was:<blockquote>soft, sweet, clear &amp; affecting, she sings with good Expression, &amp; has great Fancy &amp; even taste in her Cadences, though perhaps, a finished singer would give less way to the former, &amp; prefer few &amp; select Notes. She has an exceeding good shake, &amp; the best &amp; most critical Judges pronounce her to be infinitely superiour to <i>all</i> other English singers. (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters</span>, 1.249&#150;50)</blockquote>Burney's sister Susan, however, noted that she was &#145;without the soul or refinement of a great Italian singer&#146;  (Black, 94&#150;5). Elizabeth's voice, enhanced by her beauty, intelligence, and modesty, fostered the cult that surrounded her throughout her life. David Garrick affectionately named her &#145;the Saint&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Garrick</span>, 3.1163). Joshua Reynolds painted her as Saint Cecilia, as Charity for the window of New College, Oxford, and as the Virgin in the nativity. She was also a frequent subject for Thomas Gainsborough, and Richard Samuel painted her as Terpsichore in <span class="italic">The Nine Living Muses of Great Britain</span>. Charles Burney called her a:<blockquote>&#145;Sancta Caecilia rediviva&#146; &hellip; The tone of her voice and expressive manner of singing were as enchanting as her countenance and conversation &hellip; she was possessed of the double power of delighting an audience equally in pathetic strains, and songs of brilliant execution, which is allowed to very few singers.</blockquote>He said that her range extended &#145;a fourth above the highest note of the harpsichord&#146; (which was <i>f</i>''')  (Rees, 5.21).<br>
<br>This &#145;saint&#146; had certainly had her trials. In December 1770 the wealthy, elderly Walter Long became engaged to Elizabeth, indemnifying her parents against their loss of her earnings. He resigned his claim in 1771&#151;apparently abruptly, shortly before the intended wedding&#151;avoiding a lawsuit by paying her &pound;3000 and leaving her about &pound;1000 of jewellery and clothing already gifted  (<span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, 27 June and 1 Aug 1771). The reason for his actions are uncertain: Elizabeth may have refused to retire from public life, or may have begged him to release her from the match, or he may have been scared off by Samuel Foote's popular play <span class="italic">The Maid of Bath</span> (premiered 27 June 1771), which dealt with her relationship difficulties. These difficulties also included an importunate married suitor, &#145;Captain&#146; (in fact, Ensign) Thomas Mathews, a friend of her father's. Mathews's pursuit became so overbearing that she ran away to France in 1772. She was escorted by the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751&#150;1816)")</script>, brother to her confidant, Alicia Sheridan (later Alicia Le Fanu). According to Alicia's report, Elizabeth intended to board in a convent, but once in France Sheridan persuaded her that, given appearances, she should marry him  (Moore, 50). The &#145;marriage&#146;, putatively in March 1772, went unrecorded, was kept secret, and is unlikely to have been valid. On their return to Bath, Sheridan fought two duels with Mathews, and Elizabeth was kept under strict parental surveillance. When Sheridan's father sent him to Waltham Abbey, forbidding him contact with Elizabeth, and when Sheridan consequently began dalliances with other women, their relationship cooled.<br>
<br>In 1773 Thomas Linley took his family to London for the oratorio season. Elizabeth took principal parts in the oratorios, and at two performances the <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> reported that &#145;their Majesties paid great attention both night's to Miss Linley's singing, and seemed much pleased&#146;  (11&#150;13 March 1773). Horace Walpole said that the king &#145;ogles her as much as he dares to do in so holy a place as an oratorio&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 32.106). Frances Burney exclaimed: &#145;The whole Town seem distracted about her. Every other Diversion is forsaken&#151;Miss Linley Alone engrosses all Eyes, Ears, Hearts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters</span>, 1.249). Meanwhile, Elizabeth resigned herself to accept her father's choice of London suitor (who had agreed to leave her fortune with her father). Sheridan's interest was rekindled, however, and he somehow won her and her father round, perhaps partly through promising she could sing again (for Garrick) if the family were in need. Their widely anticipated marriage occurred on 13 April 1773 at St Marylebone.<br>
<br>Once married, Sheridan ended Elizabeth's public career, explaining to her aggrieved father that &#145;your daughter's marriage [marked] &hellip; quite as natural a period to your rights over her as her death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan</span>, 1.80). The <span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span> of 19 April 1773 estimated that her father had made nearly &pound;10,000 from her voice. Sheridan certainly declined large sums for various appearances&#151;some say &pound;3200  (Sichel, 1.425), others &pound;2000 per annum for seven years  (Watkins, 1.143). On 4 February 1774, however, he advertised a twice-weekly series of exclusive &#145;private&#146; subscription concerts  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.84). Elizabeth's feelings about her career are unclear: her father apparently had promised her a lighter workload on returning from France, and her constantly delicate state of health must have made the strenuous schedule of concert and oratorio tours all the more daunting. She had joked of fainting during a performance of <span class="italic">Samson</span> in Cambridge in June 1772, causing &#145;no small bustle among the Cantabs&#146;  (Rae, 1.195). Sheridan's refusal to let her sing for family and friends on their first Christmas cannot have pleased her, however. After the initial failure of his play <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1775), she wrote to him:<blockquote>My dear Dick, I am delighted. I always knew that it was impossible you could make anything by writing plays; so now there is nothing for it but my beginning to sing publickly again, and we shall have as much money as we like. (Sichel, 1.500&#150;01)</blockquote>Amid family concerns and poor health&#151;she had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25372/', "Thomas (Tom) Sheridan")</script>, and several miscarriages&#151;Elizabeth devoted herself to furthering Sheridan's career. When Sheridan, Thomas Linley, and Dr Ford bought Garrick's share in Drury Lane Theatre in 1776, Elizabeth kept accounts, auditioned singers, and read and advised Sheridan on play manuscripts. Michael Kelly stated that she adapted <span class="italic">Richard Coeur de Lion</span> for the English stage&#151;this was presumably the version of which the libretto is usually credited to John Burgoyne&#151;and wrote English words to a Gluck song that he performed. Sheridan's letters regarding <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (1775) demonstrate Elizabeth's hand in the music, and according to Watkins she composed for Sheridan's <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>. When Sheridan and Thomas Harris took over management of the King's Theatre opera house in 1778, Elizabeth was apparently also engaged in selecting music for that venture. Elizabeth had a bent for verse (much of her output&#151;particularly her courtship and elegiac poetry&#151;became public), and Sheridan said of their early married life that &#145;Mrs. Sheridan and myself were often obliged to keep writing for our daily leg or shoulder of mutton&#146;  (Watkins, 1.144). While the couple's courtship furnished the material for Sheridan's plays, Elizabeth may also have had an active role in their creation. In 1775 her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16734/', "Mary Linley")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16737/', "Linley, Thomas")</script>] speculated that Elizabeth had written the &#145;much admired&#146; epilogue to <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>  (Moore, 101), and Watkins said that <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> was &#145;by some &hellip; attributed to the pen of Mrs. Sheridan&#146;  (Watkins, 1.159).<br>
<br>As Sheridan turned from the theatre to politics, winning the seat of Stafford with Edward Monckton in 1780, his wife assisted him, and became one of the leading politically active whig women. In 1784 and 1790 she electioneered for Charles James Fox, her &#145;passionate admirer&#146;  (Sichel, 1.186); in 1789, during the Regency crisis, she wrote out the letter from George, prince of Wales, to the ministry, accepting the Regency, and jokingly said to her friend Mehetabel Canning that &#145;I intend when he is Regent to claim something good for myself for <i>Secret Service</i>&#146;  (Gillaspie, 201). Elizabeth continued her own writing; in December 1782 she told Alicia Sheridan, &#145;I have begun my book and you cannot think what a respectable figure it cuts already&#146;  (Sichel, 2.392). William Linley apparently told Thomas Moore that she had written &#145;an entertainment called the &#145;Haunted Village&#146;, which she gave Sheridan to add some touches to&#146;, but which he never returned, suppressing it (so Linley thought) out of jealousy  (Bor and Clelland, 109).<br>
<br>Although in 1779 Frances Burney noted that Sheridan &#145;evidently adores her,&#151;and she as evidently idolizes him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters</span>, 3.230), their marriage did not continue happily. Burney also noted that &#145;Mrs. Sheridan's Beauty is unequaled by any I <i>ever</i> saw except Mrs. Crewes&#146;  (ibid., 3.226), and indeed Sheridan's first notable affair, beginning as early as 1775, was with Frances Anne Crewe, a prominent whig hostess. Over his later liaison with Harriet Ponsonby (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cavendish), Lady Duncannon, Elizabeth wrote to Canning proposing &#145;an amiable separation&#146;, as &#145;we have been sometime separated <i>in fact</i> as Man and Wife &hellip; the duplicity of his Conduct to me, has hurt me more than any thing else, and I confess to you that my Heart is entirely Alienated from him&#146;  (Gillaspie, 324).<br>
<br>Elizabeth suffered depression not only from Sheridan's alienation, but also from the death of several of her siblings, particularly her beloved sister Mary in 1787. Caring for Mary's children distracted her, and the eldest, her namesake, was made her ward: &#145;the Legacy of her ever Dear and lamented Mother &hellip; constitutes all my Happiness&#146;, she wrote  (<span class="italic">A Nest of Nightingales</span>, 80). Distraction also came in the form of a dalliance with the infatuated duke of Clarence (later William IV). She claimed to Canning that:<blockquote>tho' I own to you I am not indifferent to his devoted Attachment for Me, and have thought more favourably of him still, since I have had reason to make Comparisons between his Conduct and S&#151;' &hellip; you may rely on the propriety of my Conduct in regard to him for many sakes&#151;but I will in future live by myself, and to my own Tastes. (Gillaspie, 324)</blockquote>By the end of 1790 Elizabeth had all but separated from Sheridan. Only pressure from her friends, including Fox, had prevented her from making the break obvious, and she continued to accompany Sheridan at Foxite whig social events. About that time she began a sexual relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9546/', "Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1763&#150;1798)")</script>, then a Foxite nobleman with leanings towards the radicalism of Thomas Paine. In Fitzgerald's words, &#145;She managed me&#146;  (Tillyard, 124). She became pregnant with his child in summer 1791, but was soon obviously ill with tuberculosis, and the pregnancy probably hastened her own death. Her daughter, Mary, was born on 30 March 1792. Elizabeth died at Bristol Hotwells in Clifton, Gloucestershire, on 28 June 1792. Her dying wish was that Sheridan should recognize Mary as his own child, but that Canning should have charge of her. Elizabeth's independence of mind extended to religious matters: she told Canning, &#145;there is nobody has more true Religion <i>at Heart</i> than I have, tho' I profess to think less seriously of forms and Ceremonies than some do&#146;  (Gillaspie, 190). None the less, she was buried on 7 July in Wells Cathedral next to her sister, in front of a great crowd of onlookers.<br>
