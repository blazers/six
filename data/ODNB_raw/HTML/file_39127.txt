<span class="headword">&AElig;thelstan &AElig;theling</span> <span class="st"> [Athelstan the Atheling]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1014), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8915/', "&#198;thelred II (c.966x8&#150;1016)")</script>, king of England, and of &AElig;thelred's first wife, &AElig;lfgifu, daughter of Thored (Thorth), who held office as earl of Northumbria from <i>c</i>.975 to <i>c</i>.992. &AElig;thelstan was born probably in the early or mid-980s, and made his first appearance as a witness in a charter of King &AElig;thelred for Abingdon Abbey issued in 993. Little is known of his childhood and youth, though there is reason to believe that he may have spent some part of it on a royal estate at &AElig;thelingadene (Dean &#145;of the athelings&#146;, identified as Dean in west Sussex), and that his paternal grandmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/194/', "&#198;lfthryth")</script>, may have played a significant part in his upbringing. &AElig;thelstan continued to attest charters in the later 990s and in the early years of the eleventh century, invariably positioned ahead of his younger brothers; his last appearance is in a charter dated 1013. King &AElig;thelred's marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8794/', "Emma")</script> of Normandy, in 1002, does not appear to have affected &AElig;thelstan's position as his father's prospective successor, and it must be assumed that sooner or later &AElig;thelstan became a significant political force in the kingdom. He would have witnessed the increasing influence at court of Ealdorman Eadric Streona, and may well not have approved; he seems also to have formed a friendship with Sigeferth and Morcar, two of the leading thegns of the &#145;Five Boroughs&#146; in the east midlands. In 1013 King &AElig;thelred was forced into temporary exile in Normandy; and while it is not known for certain what became of &AElig;thelstan and of his surviving younger brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8502/', "Edmund (Ironside)")</script> and Eadwig, during the reign of King Swein Forkbeard (1013&#150;14), it seems likely that they remained somewhere in England.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelred returned from exile in the spring of 1014, whereupon &AElig;thelstan would have resumed his position as his father's prospective successor. It would appear, however, that &AElig;thelstan fell ill during the early summer of that year. He received his father's permission to draw up his will on 25 June 1014, and died later on the same day. It emerges from the will (copies of which were preserved in the archives of Christ Church, Canterbury, and the Old Minster, Winchester) that &AElig;thelstan held land in at least ten counties of south-eastern England, and that he took special interest not only in the religious houses at Winchester and Canterbury, but also in those at Shaftesbury and Ely. His personal possessions included no fewer than eleven swords (one of which had belonged to Offa, king of the Mercians), a coat of mail (which had been lent to Morcar), two shields, a drinking-horn, a silver-coated trumpet, and a string of fine horses. &AElig;thelstan was buried at the Old Minster, Winchester. His untimely death meant that his younger brother, Edmund Ironside, entered the political arena as King &AElig;thelred's prospective successor. Edmund was soon forced, in effect, to take a stand against the regime personified by his ailing father but controlled by Eadric Streona, prompting Eadric to transfer his allegiance to Cnut, and leading ultimately to the defeat of the English at the battle of Ashingdon in 1016.<br>
