<span class="headword">Aiken,  Joan Delano</span>  (1924&#150;2004), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 4 September 1924 at Jeakes House, Mermaid Street, Rye, Sussex, the younger daughter and youngest of three children of Conrad Potter Aiken (1889&#150;1973), an American Pulitzer prize-winning poet and writer, and his Canadian-born first wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDonald (1889&#150;1970), who was also a writer. Her parents' marriage was dissolved in 1929 and another writer was added to Aiken's family the following year with her mother's marriage to the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56879/', "Martin Armstrong (1882&#150;1974)")</script>.<br>
<br>With her older sister Jane (1917&#150;2009), the writer Jane Aiken Hodge&#151;their brother John Aiken (1913&#150;1990) was also a writer&#151;Joan was educated at home by her mother until she was twelve, when she was sent to Wychwood School in Oxford (1936&#150;40). Her education at home included learning Latin, Greek, Spanish, and German as well as being read the English classics, including Charles Dickens, whose <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> was to have a particularly strong influence on her. She began writing stories when she was five; from this early age, she and her sister Jane swapped details of the imaginary worlds they created throughout their childhood while also providing entertainment for their younger stepbrother, David.<br>
<br>At sixteen, while away at school, Aiken wrote her first full-length novel and at eighteen she had &#145;The Dreamer&#146;, her first short story for adults, accepted for publication. From then on, she wrote three distinct categories of children's books: short stories, fiction for ten to fourteen year olds, and short novels for younger readers. In 1941 she had her first public success when her short story &#145;The Parrot Pirate Princess&#146; was broadcast by the BBC in their <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> programme. Between 1943 and 1949 she worked as an information officer, and later as the librarian, at the United Nations' London information centre. On 7 July 1945 she married Ronald George Brown (1911&#150;1955), a news agency journalist and the son of Albert Brown, engineer; the couple had a son, John, and a daughter, Elizabeth, before Brown's death from tuberculosis. In the years following her husband's death Aiken worked as a journalist, including five years as features editor at <span class="italic">Argosy</span> magazine (1955&#150;60), and as a copywriter for J. Walter Thompson (1960&#150;61).<br>
<br>Aiken's first two published works, <span class="italic">All You've Ever Wanted and Other Stories</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">More Than You've Bargained For and Other Stories</span> (1955), were both collections of short stories for children. Aiken was to become renowned for collections of this kind and in particular for <span class="italic">A Necklace of Raindrops and Other Stories</span> (1968), <span class="italic">A Small Pinch of Weather and Other Stories</span> (1969), and the <span class="italic">Last Slice of Rainbow and Other Stories</span> (1985), all of which include some magical and fantastical &#145;fairy stories&#146;, which were her preferred style for this genre.<br>
<br>Aiken made her name as an exceptional writer for children with her second novel, <span class="italic">The Wolves of Willoughby Chase</span> (1962). Set in an imaginary nineteenth-century Britain that was already linked to Europe by a tunnel through which wolves freely roamed, this is a dramatic gothic adventure with a strong Dickensian feel, especially in the naming of the characters: Miss Slighcarp, the evil governess, Mrs Brisket, the cruel headmistress, and Mrs Bloodvessel, the landlady who was ready to fleece poor children of all they had. The title launched a series of novels that was to occupy Aiken for the rest of her life. In the second, <span class="italic">Black Hearts in Battersea</span> (1964), she introduced Dido Twite, a resourceful and feisty girl from a poverty-stricken background whose morals and intelligence led her socially upwards. Although she was not always the central character, Dido Twite's story lies at the heart of the sequence of titles that includes <span class="italic">The Whispering Mountain</span> (1969), which won the 1969 <span class="italic">Guardian</span> children's book prize, <span class="italic">Dido and Pa</span> (1986), and the concluding volume, <span class="italic">The Witch of Clatteringshaws</span>, which was published posthumously in 2005. She wrote other stories for this age group, including <span class="italic">Night Fall</span> (1969), which won the 1972 Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe award.<br>
<br>Aiken's stories for younger, or newer, readers were launched by a commission from the BBC's children's programme <span class="italic">Jackanory</span>. For them she created Arabel and her constant companion the monstrous raven Mortimer. They made a marvellous double act. Aiken later described them in the following terms: &#145;Arabel is the ego, the perfectly sensible good side and Mortimer is the id, unrepressed passion, and they kind of balance each other&#146;  (M. Rosen and J. Burridge, <span class="italic">Treasure Islands 2</span>, 1993, 19). They appeared first in <span class="italic">Arabel's Raven</span> (1972) and then in <span class="italic">Mortimer's Tie</span> (1976), followed by a number of sequels including <span class="italic">Mortimer Says Nothing</span> (1985). In addition to her writing for children Aiken wrote adult novels, the first of which was <span class="italic">The Silence of Herondale</span> (1964). Among her adult titles were eleven crime novels including <span class="italic">Trouble with Product X</span> (1966) (entitled <span class="italic">Beware of the Banquet</span> in the United States) and <span class="italic">Foul Matter</span> (1983). In 1999 she was appointed MBE for her services to literature. After becoming a full-time writer in the early 1960s she lived at Petworth, Sussex, moving finally to The Hermitage on East Street. On 2 September 1976 she married the American artist and teacher Julius Israel Goldstein (1918&#150;2001), whose father of the same name had been a company director, and following her marriage also spent time in New York. She died at The Hermitage on 4 January 2004 after a fall. She was survived by her two children.<br>
