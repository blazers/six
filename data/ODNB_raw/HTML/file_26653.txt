<span class="headword">Stratton,  John Proudfoot</span>  (1830&#150;1895), <span class="occ">surgeon and civil servant</span>, son of David Stratton, a solicitor in Perth, was born in the parish of Caputh, near Dunkeld, Perthshire, on 2 July 1830. He was educated in his native town and afterwards at North Shields, where he became an apprentice to Dr Ingham in 1840. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1851, and graduated BM and MD at the University of Aberdeen in 1852 and 1855, respectively. At Aberdeen he gained either a medal or a first class in every subject of study. In May 1852 he was awarded a bursary from the East India Company.<br>
<br>After holding various posts in the Indian Medical Service (IMS) (Bombay) from 1852 onwards, Stratton was appointed in December 1854 residency surgeon in Baroda, where he took an active part in founding the Maharaja Gaikwar's hospital and in vaccinating the local population. In May 1857 he was, in addition to his medical post, appointed to act as assistant resident. He performed his duties with ability during the uprising, and received the thanks of the resident, Sir Richmond Campbell Shakespear. After Shakespear's departure for England, Stratton acted as resident until the arrival of Colonel Wallace. In 1859 he was selected to take political charge of Bundelkhand, a district embracing several minor states which were experiencing unrest. Stratton's services were again acknowledged by the government, while the East India Company marked its appreciation by awarding him extra pay. Stratton married Georgina Anne Anderson on 12 April 1859. They had six children.<br>
<br>In 1862 Stratton was appointed commissioner and sessions judge for Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand, and he was promoted in June 1864 from political assistant to political agent; from May to July 1876 he was officiating resident. On 4 March 1881 he was appointed officiating resident in Mewar, and in July he was posted to the western states of Rajputana; on 27 January 1882 he moved to Jaipur in the eastern states. In 1885 he retired from the service, being under fifty-five years of age and following the rule, with the rank of brigade surgeon.<br>
<br>Stratton served Britain well in his capacity of political agent. He obtained from the local rulers free remission of transit duties and he established the Bundelkhand Rajkumar College for their sons. He also organized the building of hill roads and instituted vaccination in central India.<br>
<br>Stratton died on 8 August 1895 at his home, 51 Nevern Square, South Kensington, London, and was buried in Brookwood cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
