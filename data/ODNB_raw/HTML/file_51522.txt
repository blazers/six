<span class="headword">Bufton,  Sydney Osborne</span>  (1908&#150;1993), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 12 January 1908 at Teviot, Temple Avenue, Llandrindod Wells, Radnorshire, the second son in the family of four sons and one daughter of James Osborne Bufton, a tobacconist, and later an estate agent, alderman, and JP, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peters. Educated at Llandrindod Wells community school (1920&#150;22) and Dean Close School, Cheltenham (1922&#150;6), he showed an early aptitude for radio, constructing one of the first crystal sets in Wales. In 1926&#150;7 he was an engineering pupil at Vickers; he attended evening classes at Erith Technical College and in June 1927 gained an intermediate BSc.<br>
<br>Bufton then successfully applied for RAF pilot training, reporting to Uxbridge on 16 December 1927 for an initial drill and discipline course, and was posted to 4 flying training school, Abu Sueir, Egypt. Instructed on Avro 504Ks, he gained his wings on 22 October 1928; then, as a pilot officer, he was posted in December to 100 squadron, which had Horsley day bombers. After seventeen months there he was sent to the Central Flying School, and in August 1930 he was posted to 5 flying training school as an instructor. But in order to gain a specialist qualification and a permanent career in the RAF he applied for an aeronautical engineering course at the home aircraft depot in Henlow. In September 1932 he was awarded a permanent commission, and in July 1933 he completed his course.<br>
<br>In October 1933 Bufton was posted as engineering officer to the aircraft depot in Hinaidi, Iraq. Having bought a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost for &pound;8, he had it shipped out to Basrah, then drove it to Baghdad. It proved to be an invaluable unit transport. In June 1934 he passed a colloquial Arabic exam; and while on UK leave in August that year he was cabled by Lady Hoare, the wife of the British minister in Tehran, asking if he would fly out a DH Gipsy Major Moth. He agreed and made the flight with Flying Officer Jack Larking of 55 squadron, based at Hinaidi. Then in June 1935 he was asked by the Iraq Petroleum Company if he would fly a DH Dragon back to the UK, which he did in July after applying for twenty-eight days' annual leave. When in July 1936 his overseas tour ended he was posted to the department of training in the Air Ministry, where his work involved overseeing the practical implications of the RAF expansion schemes.<br>
<br>In January 1939 Bufton was sent on the Staff College course at Andover and completed it just before the outbreak of war, when he was posted to France with no. 2 mission. He then served at the British air forces headquarters until they were ordered to move to Nantes; he left there as the Panzers rolled in and was flown back to the UK on 17 June 1940. Bufton was posted to nos 19 and 20 operational training units to fly Whitleys before being sent to command 10 squadron, with which he undertook nineteen operations. In November 1940 he was awarded the DFC. On the night of 24&#150;5 October his youngest brother, John, flying with 49 squadron, had been lost when his Hampden came down in the sea near Skegness.<br>
<br>On 12 April 1941 Bufton was posted to Linton on Ouse to form 76 squadron with Halifaxes. He converted to the new type but was then promoted group captain and ordered to open up Pocklington, which he commanded to the end of October. With effect from 1 November he was deputy director, bomber operations, at the Air Ministry. In this appointment, and as director from March 1943 to June 1945, he deployed his considerable writing skill to bring about operational improvements in Bomber Command&#151;the provision of three emergency airfields, radar navigation, and target-finding aids, and the establishment of a Pathfinder force (which he proposed, despite opposition from the commander-in-chief, Sir Arthur Harris, and in which his younger brother Hal served with great distinction). In 1944 he advocated attacks on precision targets such as oil supplies and the ball-bearing industry rather than area bombing of German cities. Arguing cogently and with clarity, he was &#145;beating Bert [Harris] at his own game&#146;, as the chief of the air staff, Sir Charles Portal, put it.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1943 &#145;the little Air Commodore&#146; (as Churchill called him) married (Maureen Anthony Osra) Susan Browne (<i>b</i>. 1921), who served in the WRNS and modelled for recruiting photographs; she was the daughter of Colonel Edgar Browne, army officer. They had two daughters, Carol and Marilyn. In the 1945 new year honours he was made a CB; he was also made a commander of the Legion of Merit by the president of the USA in October 1945, and a commander (with swords) of the order of Orange Nassau by the queen of the Netherlands in November 1947.<br>
<br>Bufton held a succession of important post-war appointments: air officer commanding Egypt (1945&#150;6); officer commanding tactics wing, central bomber establishment (1946&#150;8); assistant chief of air staff (operation/plans), air forces, Western Europe (1948&#150;51); director of weapons, Air Ministry (1951&#150;2); air officer administration, Bomber Command (1952&#150;3); air officer commanding British forces, Aden (as an air vice-marshal) (1953&#150;5); senior air staff officer, Bomber Command (1955&#150;8); and finally assistant chief of air staff (intelligence) (1958&#150;61). He retired in October 1961.<br>
<br>Bufton then returned to one of his youthful interests, radio, and founded Radionic Products, which after eight years' successful trading was bought out by Philips. He was often called upon to comment upon books and programmes about the bombing offensive in the Second World War, telling a BBC researcher that &#145;without Bomber Command the war would have been lost&#146;  (private information). In 1967 he was appointed high sheriff of Radnorshire, and three years later he was elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, sponsored by Dr Barnes Wallis and Sir Frank Whittle.<br>
<br>Buf Bufton was a keen sportsman, playing hockey for Wales, the combined services, and the RAF, and excelling at other sports; he was also an amateur artist and poet. He died at Epsom General Hospital on 29 March 1993 following a stroke, shortly after he and his wife had celebrated their golden wedding; he was survived by his wife and their two daughters. At a service of thanksgiving for his life in St Mark's Church, Reigate, on 6 April his poem &#145;Flight&#146;, extolling the airman's freedom in his element&#151;&#145;Gods now, not men. No longer bound to earth&#146;&#151;was read by his grandson Alex Hieatt.<br>
