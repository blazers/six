<span class="headword">Wickham,  William</span>  (1761&#150;1840), <span class="occ">politician</span>, diplomatist, and founder of a British foreign secret service, was the elder son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Wickham (1731&#150;1804) and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1815), daughter and heir of William Lamplugh of Cottingley, vicar of Dewsbury, Yorkshire. Henry Wickham had been educated at Leipzig and Neuchatel universities and began his military career with two years in the army of Piedmont. William was born in October 1761 at Cottingley, Bingley, Yorkshire, and baptized on 11 November 1761. He was educated at Winchester College (1773&#150;6), Harrow School (1776), and Christ Church, Oxford (1779&#150;82), where he was a younger contemporary of William Wyndham Grenville, John King, and Charles Abbot (Baron Colchester). At Geneva University (1782&#150;6) he studied law under Amedeo Perdriau, and graduated MA in February 1786. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in November 1786.<br>
<br>Wickham married Eleanore Madeleine (1763&#150;1836), daughter of Professor Louis Bertrand and Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mallet, in Geneva Cathedral on 10 August 1788. This linked him with the leading families of Geneva and laid the foundation of his career. His brother-in-law Professor Marc Auguste Pictet was related to Isaac Pictet, British charg&eacute; d'affaires at Bern (1772&#150;4), while Eleanore's cousin, the Syndic Rigaud, became an influential friend.<br>
<br>Wickham served as a commissioner of bankrupts from 1790 to 1794. On 7 July 1792 his name (misspelt) appeared in the fiats for appointment of magistrates. He was attached to the Whitechapel police office  (TNA: PRO, C234/25). Wickham again visited Switzerland in 1792. On his return he wrote to John King, under-secretary at the Home Office, asking to be remembered if anyone was to be sent out to Switzerland and indicating that his communication &#145;must <i>be</i> and <i>remain</i> in strict and perfect confidence between you and me&#146;  (Wickham to King, 4 Dec 1792, Hants. RO, 38M49/6/5/2). This refutes the long-held belief that it was Lord Grenville's friendship that procured Wickham his diplomatic employment; rather, it was King's friendship with both.<br>
<br>As a government magistrate Wickham worked at the Home Office and employed informers to discover possible treasonable activities. He was commended by ministers for his ability in this field, which included procuring information on the activities of &eacute;migr&eacute;s as well as of the London Corresponding Society. This was probably the secret service carried out for Lord Grenville from August 1793, concerning which Wickham wrote that to avoid comment all communication passed through the office of the lord chancellor, Lord Rosslyn, and that all trace was removed from the records  (27 March 1831, Hants. RO, 38M49/1/56/24). His information led to the arrest of the London Corresponding Society officers in May 1794  (E. Nepean to Wickham, 10 May 1794, Hants. RO, 38M49/6/6/1).<br>
<br>The third duke of Portland, who was then home secretary, appointed Wickham as superintendent of aliens in July 1794. This position officially linked his work as a police magistrate with Lord Grenville and William Pitt. To Pitt, Wickham made regular visits as an intermediary with Portland: &#145;I was often received in his dressing room, more than once in his bedroom&#146;. Pitt generally &#145;either minuted down or desired me to report verbally his observations to the Duke of Portland&#146;  (Hants. RO, 38M49/1/56/24).<br>
<br>Wickham's diplomatic career began in October 1794. His request for a post in Switzerland was remembered on the arrival of a memoir, forwarded by Lord Robert Fitzgerald from Bern. It purported to be a proposal for peace from two members of the French national convention. Wickham was dispatched on 15 October with Grenville's unsigned instructions to investigate the authenticity of the memoir  (Hants. RO, 38M49/1/26/1). The secrecy and haste of his departure precluded any possibility of a secretary to accompany him, and the only funds provided were &pound;200 for travelling expenses. Investigation led Fitzgerald and Wickham to conclude that the memoir was a clever intrigue. But Wickham remained in Switzerland, where he began the build-up of an extensive network of secret service agents throughout central Europe and France. Fitzgerald was granted leave of absence on 9 December 1794. He presented Wickham to the Bern Council as charg&eacute; d'affaires, lent him &pound;100, and left in January 1795  (TNA: PRO, FO74/4 1794, 38M49/1/27/3).<br>
<br>Wickham had no financial resources, public or private; his immediate necessity was to find a friend, a secretary, and funds with which to entertain &#145;small quick parties to a few friends. It is liked here, and without it you are without consideration&#146;  (Wickham to Grenville, Hants. RO, 38M49/1/27/3). Initially Grenville, with no precedent for funding a foreign secret service, could only pass money through his private account, with the Treasury's obligatory three-month delay. So Wickham had to accept help from his wife's banker relatives. But as an impoverished country gentleman he had a careful approach to money, telling Grenville in March 1795 that his expenses were greater than expected&#151;and rising. His bill at the post office &#145;regularly exceeded &pound;2 per week &hellip; and travel was extravagant&#146;. Wickham hoped that the delay on payments of public funds could be relaxed in his case, &#145;otherwise I really know not how I must go on&#146;. Two months later his na&iuml;vety had evaporated, and he was sending Grenville's secretary receipts for &pound;6000&#151;exclusive of his own expenses  (Grenville's &#145;separate account&#146;, 24 May 1795&#150;27 Jan 1796).<br>
<br>Promoted to minister-plenipotentiary in March 1795, Wickham resided alternately at Bern and Lausanne, with a privileged position in relation to the Bern councils. By appointing Swiss officials as British officers in the Swiss regiments paid by Britain, Wickham achieved control over passports on the Jura frontier with France  (Cavin). He set up a regular correspondence with Lyon and Paris, and, via Francis Drake and John Trevor, British diplomats at Genoa and Turin, also with northern Italy and the Midi  (Hants. RO, 38M49/1/10&#150;11). At the same time Lord Grenville directed Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Gregan Craufurd, on a special mission at the Austrian army headquarters, to liaise with Wickham from June 1795 both for political purposes and as a method of passing funds&#151;via army extraordinaries&#151;authorized by parliament. Wickham took on several secretaries&#151;all French&#151;for the different aspects of this work, while Grenville sent the Foreign Office clerk Charles William Flint to assist in May 1795 (TNA: PRO, FO 29/5, FO 74/9, nos. 50 and 51; BL, Add. MS 69440, fols. 72&#150;3; Hants. RO, 38M49/1/27/12).<br>
<br>Wickham's intentions were to assist royalist insurrections within France, to provide funds to manipulate elections to the Paris councils, and to suborn a French republican army to support a restoration. By May 1797 he appeared to have achieved his purpose. General Pichegru, supported by senior officers, was well placed to head the overthrow of the Directory, but proved incapable of the revolutionary action required. Wickham's plans were destroyed by the Director Barras, who, advised by General Bonaparte, carried out the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797). The Director Barth&eacute;lemy and generals Pichegru and Willot, with a total of forty deputies, were deported to the penal colony of Sinnamary in French Guiana. Wickham's funding of anti-Directory espionage was disclosed, leaving his credibility as a diplomat in shreds and his networks temporarily paralysed. Friends in the Bern Council asked him to &#145;withdraw quietly without waiting for orders&#146;  (Hants. RO, 38M49/6/13/1, 17 Oct 1797, 38M49/1/56/25). He left Switzerland on 7 November to visit the wounded Charles Gregan Craufurd at Frankfurt.<br>
<br>Grenville ordered the withdrawal of the Bern mission, but the continuation of the correspondence with royalists of the interior of France  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Talbot c. 14, fols. 60&#150;61, b 21, fols. 71&#150;5). With these arrangements in place, Wickham and his first secretary, James Talbot, returned to London in January 1798, when Portland appointed Wickham under-secretary at the Home Office with John King. But Thomas Carter, Portland's private secretary, disputed the position of superintendent of aliens that he had held in Wickham's absence. This was resolved, and in July 1798 a king's warrant appointed Wickham, John King, and Charles Flint joint superintendents (Hants. RO, 38M49/6/2/1&#150;2/; TNA: PRO, HO38/7/573). Meantime, the immediate task was to arrange for Talbot's secret return to the Swabian frontier with Switzerland. He left in February 1798, while Wickham reorganized and increased the status of the alien office.<br>
<br>In May 1799 Wickham returned to Switzerland to liaise with the subsidized Russo-Austrian armies and to replace Talbot, who had lost control of the Swabian agency, which included the Paris deputies proscribed in the purge of September 1797, and Swiss &eacute;migr&eacute;s. A coherent force had been formed under General Hotze. The result&#151;the assassination of the French envoys at Rastadt in April 1799&#151;had shocked Europe  (Sparrow). Wickham was to control the Swiss corps and liaise with Austria, Bavaria, and Wurtemberg for the supply of further subsidized troops, while continuing the secret networks within France. General Pichegru joined Wickham at Z&uuml;rich to meet an envoy from Director Barras, who had agreed to a restoration of Louis XVIII in return for a large bribe and letters patent providing a pardon for his regicide. Due to the French victory at Z&uuml;rich on September 1799, the meeting never took place. Incriminating papers were seized at General Korsakov's headquarters and Pichegru fled (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, vol. 5; Archives Nationales, F7 6217, dos. 4064, 19 Feb 1801).<br>
<br>Wickham's next plan was to raise a French royalist army in the Midi, to be commanded by General Willot, supported by Pichegru. This extremely expensive project was destroyed by Bonaparte's victory at Marengo on 14 June 1800. The apparent defeat of all his plans, combined with the suggestion by George Rose, the secretary to the Treasury, that he had misused public funds, caused Wickham to retreat to a monastery, close to a nervous breakdown. Portland praised his actions, but the second coalition and the Swabian agency were effectively finished. Wickham returned to England in 1801  (Hants. RO, 38M49/8/11, 38M49/1/27/12, 38M49/8/21/1&#150;3).<br>
<br>Wickham hoped for a diplomatic appointment at Berlin. However he was <i>persona non grata</i> in Prussia, just as he was in Switzerland. In February 1802 he was appointed a privy councillor and chief secretary in Ireland, and returned as MP for Heytesbury, which he shortly exchanged for Cashel. As chief secretary he continued the work of his predecessor, Charles Abbot, in reducing government expenditure. His resignation in January 1804 was a complicated decision. Although he used the excuse of ill health, his true reasons were horror at the execution of Robert Emmet; a belief that suppression of the Catholics was morally wrong; and a conviction that the duke of York's decision to give Lord Cathcart sole command of the military in Ireland, over the head of the lord lieutenant, was in contempt of the constitution  (Hants. RO, 38M49/1/48/6, 7, 38M49/1/56/15&#150;16).<br>
<br>From 1806 to 1807, as MP for Callington and a lord of the Treasury, Wickham defended his use of public funds  (Hants. RO, 38M49/1/137, 38M49/1/138). But his resignation as chief secretary had ended his career, and, feeling a failure, he spent much time in later life vindicating that decision. He could not see the far-reaching effects of his secret service organization, not only on the Napoleonic war but also on twentieth-century wars, through the resurrection of its principles in 1908 (Hants. RO, 38M49/1/56/15&#150;16, 31, 35&#150;8; TNA: PRO, KV 1/1).<br>
<br>In 1810 Wickham was made an honorary DCL at Oxford. He had a house close to Lord Grenville's Dropmore and bought Binsted Wyck, in Hampshire, but after 1815 he spent much time in southern France or Switzerland, having no settled home for the last fifteen years of his life. He died at Brighton on 22 October 1840.<br>

<a name="cosubject_29349"></a><span class="headword">Henry Lewis Wickham</span>  (1789&#150;1864)<span class="occ"></span>, the Wickhams' only son, was born at Cottingley, Yorkshire, on 19 May 1789. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, and called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 13 May 1817. He was appointed receiver-general of Gibraltar by Lord Grenville in lieu of an extra pension for his father, and served as principal private secretary to Viscount Althorp (third Earl Spencer) during the latter's stint as chancellor of the exchequer (1830&#150;34). He served as a commissioner of excise enquiry, chairman of the board of stamps and taxes (1838&#150;48), and as a commissioner of public loan. With his cousin John Anthony Cramer he wrote <span class="italic">A Dissertation of the Passage of Hannibal over the Alps</span> (1820). He married Lucy, daughter of William Markham of Becca Hall, Yorkshire, and they had three children: William of Binsted Wyck, editor of <span class="italic">The Correspondence</span> (1870) and MP for Petersfield, Hampshire (1892&#150;7); Leonora Emma; and Henry Lamplugh. Henry Wickham died in Chesterfield Street, Mayfair, London, on 27 October 1864  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1864 (vol. 2)).<br>
