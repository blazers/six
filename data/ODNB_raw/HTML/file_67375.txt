<span class="headword">Walcott,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1683), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was a native of Warwickshire and (according to Roger Boyle, earl of Orrery, who knew him from the 1650s) a relative of Edmund Ludlow. His father became a settler in Ireland, and the memory of 1641 was to burn itself into Walcott's political identity. In 1672 he was to recall to his interrogators, &#145;how the Irish Papists had in 1641 murdered his father, and turned all his children a-begging, whereof he being one and a spectator, he believed their principles were the same now as then&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672&#150;3</i>, 152&#150;3).<br>
<br>Walcott served in Cromwell's army in Ireland in the 1650s, possibly initially in Henry Ingoldsby's regiment of dragoons, certainly as a captain-lieutenant in Edmund Ludlow's regiment of horse, for he acted as Ludlow's agent in obtaining land for troopers' arrears upon its disbandment in 1655. He commanded a troop of horse in the brigade dispatched to England in August 1659, and though he had supported the reinstatement of the Rump Parliament, he was arrested by Daniel Redman, its new commander. General Monck permitted Walcott to return to his family and estate in Ireland, &#145;supposing (as affaires were) he could doe less hurte there than in England&#146;, according to Ludlow's account  (Ludlow, 86). Ludlow speaks approvingly of his former officer and possible kinsman in <span class="italic">A Voyce from the Watch Tower</span>: Captain Walcott was &#145;an honest and faithfull officer of the Irish brigade, having gained an interest in the officers and souldiers by his sincere deportement and good conduct&#146;; he was &#145;a faithfull servant of the Comonwealth&#146;  (ibid., 85, 177).<br>
<br>By May 1660 Walcott was back in England and on 22 May he appeared at the bar of the House of Commons to accuse the Irish Catholic Sir Edward Fitzharris of having told him in Westminster Hall &#145;that the Irish were the King's best subjects, and that they would have their lands againe&#146;  (Ludlow, 177). Perhaps he had returned to England with Sir John Clotworthy, who had gone over in March to represent the interests of the Irish adventurers and the soldiers settled in Ireland: when Walcott went to the Commons to accuse Fitzharris and a Mr Johnson, he was accompanied by Clotworthy. Indeed, Walcott's information seems to have played its part in the declarations by the Commons two days later that all Irish rebels and papists in England were to depart and that no Irish Catholics were to disturb the possession of any English protestant in Ireland except by due course of law until parliament had decided the future of such properties.<br>
<br>The Restoration brought Walcott incarceration in Dublin Castle on suspicion of having been Charles I's executioner, but he was acquitted. About 1661 he sold his property and went to London, but had returned by early 1663. Following the disclosure of the Dublin plot early that year, Orrery, who had already required him to be bound over in &pound;1000 for his good behaviour, sent him to Dublin for interrogation. In early 1666 Thomas Blood recruited Walcott for the abortive Liverpool plot, allegedly placing him in charge of Clare and Limerick. In November 1672 Walcott was again accused of conspiring to seize Limerick. Reportedly, he intended to acquire weapons from the Netherlands and had a declaration calling for the Long Parliament's return and the abolition of popery, prelacy, and the hearth tax. He was arrested, upon which he vividly described his panic at the thought of a new Irish rising and implied his fear of the king's pro-Catholic intentions, for otherwise, &#145;If the king would stand neuter, he doubted not but we were able to beat them into the sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672&#150;3</i>, 153). Walcott was sent to England and confined in the Tower of London on 8 February 1673, notwithstanding his professions of innocence and his assertion that the English monarchy was the best in the world. In May 1673 the earl of Essex, the lord lieutenant, who deemed Walcott &#145;a great man with the Anabaptist Partie here&#146;, thought he would be useful as an informer against dissidents in Ireland, but nothing came of this  (BL, Stowe MS 213, fol. 196<i>r</i>). After his release, the date of which is uncertain, Walcott returned to Limerick and his estate in co. Clare, which was now worth approximately &pound;800 per annum.<br>
<br>Walcott returned to England in June 1682 at the invitation of the earl of Shaftesbury, to whom he had been introduced by William, Lord Howard of Escrick. Walcott would later admit that the earl had enlisted him in his proposed insurrection. In October 1682 the barrister Robert West, as he subsequently confessed, learned about Shaftesbury's plans from Walcott, who invited West to draft a manifesto. When Shaftesbury fled to the Netherlands in November 1682 he was accompanied by Walcott and the minister Robert Ferguson. After returning to England in February 1683 Walcott and Ferguson participated in the cabal that included Colonel John Rumsey and the whig attorneys Richard Nelthorpe and Richard Goodenough. This group plotted to assassinate Charles and James at the Rye House, near Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93794', "Rye House plotters")</script>]. According to West, Walcott agreed to lead the party that would attack the royal guards, though Walcott later insisted he had opposed assassination. He admitted attending three or four meetings of the cabal, at which they asserted that their &#145;liberties and properties as English men &hellip; were &hellip; violated&#146;  (Walcott, 2). After the Rye House scheme collapsed, Walcott participated in meetings to plan a general insurrection.<br>
<br>When the plotters learned that Josiah Keeling had disclosed the conspiracy to the government, eight of them met at Walcott's house on 18 June 1683, but he opted not to flee overseas because he suffered from gout. Walcott, said West, &#145;comforted himself with a prophetick faith, saying he was perswaded that God would yet deliver the Nation but did not approve of the Instruments who had at present undertaken it&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 38847, fol. 119<i>v</i>). Arrested on 8 July, he was the first person tried, probably because he had been involved with both Shaftesbury and West, and had sent a letter to Sir Leoline Jenkins offering a full confession in return for a pardon. Although he had effectively admitted his involvement, he pleaded not guilty when a pardon was not forthcoming. West, Rumsey, Keeling, and Zachary Bourne testified against him. Denouncing their credibility, Walcott insisted that he was guilty only of misprision of treason. Found guilty of treason, he was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 20 July. His son John received permission to bury the body, but the head was affixed to Aldersgate.<br>
<br>Walcott, described as &#145;a very stout man&#146; in 1672, was depicted as a tall, rather slender man with a dark complexion eleven years later (TNA: PRO, SP 63/332/47; SP 29/429/32). Although a Baptist, he once referred to himself as &#145;being for the Congregational way&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/332/47, 53.1). Michael Boyle, archbishop of Dublin, deemed him &#145;a very considerable person under the usurper [Cromwell] and a by-got in his perswasions&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/332/49); in fact, he was a man whose convictions prompted him to risk his estate and ultimately his life to save England and Ireland from the perceived threat posed by James and Catholicism.<br>
