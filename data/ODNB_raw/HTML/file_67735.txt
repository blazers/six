<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rainier,  (Ivy) Priaulx</span>  (1903&#150;1986), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 3 February 1903 at Howick, South Africa, a hamlet in the Natal midlands, the population of which was predominately Zulu. In 1913 she entered the South African College of Music, Cape Town, and studied violin. Her progress was quick and in 1920 she won a scholarship to attend the Royal Academy of Music, London, where she studied harmony and counterpoint with J. B. McEwen and violin with Rowsby Woof. She then worked as a violinist, chamber musician, and teacher until a grant from an anonymous benefactor in 1935 enabled her to concentrate on composing. But her interest in performance continued, and she later coached chamber music groups at the summer school of music at Bryanston.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Rainier's potential as a composer was obvious and, after impressing Sir Arnold Bax with her talent, she spent three months in Paris with the renowned teacher Nadia Boulanger in 1937. But by the end of her studies her portfolio was small, as she had written only a handful of works: an early string quartet in 1924, <span class="italic">Two Archaic Songs</span> for unaccompanied chorus in 1927, a duo for violin and piano in 1932, the <span class="italic">Incantation</span> for clarinet and orchestra in 1933, and the <span class="italic">Three Greek Epigrams</span> for soprano and piano in 1937. With the completion of her string quartet no. 1 in 1939, her career reached a watershed, and her reputation was secured. In the quartet she juxtaposed European techniques with an interest in African music; utilized a traditional four-movement plan; employed adventurous rhythmic repetition and alteration; limited her harmonic range; and emphasized the tritone, an interval that was common to many of her compositions. The Amadeus Quartet recorded the work with the support of the British Council in 1951 and later it was used as the basis for a ballet.<br>
<br>In 1943 Rainier was appointed professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music and composed a suite for clarinet and piano. The suite elicited a poor critical response: some commentators argued that the work relied too heavily on rhythm and lacked melodic invention, while others suggested that the piano writing lacked skill. She responded quickly to these criticisms and tried to address some of them in her viola sonata of 1945. By employing extended melodic lines and by drawing upon her experiences as a string player, she produced a work of strength and beauty. But she never abandoned her interest in rhythm and the last movement of the sonata employs vital, dance-like structures. Rhythmic drive, small melodic units, and triadic harmony continued to dominate her style in the late 1940s, and these techniques can be found in <span class="italic">Sinfonia da camera</span>, broadcast by the BBC on 21 November 1947, and in the <span class="italic">Barbaric Dance Suite</span> for piano, written in 1949. The suite draws upon her early experiences in Natal, evoking the rhythms and melodies of the Zulu nation. Rainier claimed that her evocation of African music was subconscious and not the result of formal studies. But her assertion should be treated with caution, as her song <span class="italic">Ubunzima</span> (1948), a setting of Zulu words for voice and guitar, suggests a deeper understanding of the cultural practices of her homeland than that to which she admitted.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Rainier moved to St Ives, Cornwall, and became friends with the artists Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. Her relationship with Hepworth and Nicholson affected her style, and their influence is apparent in the suite <span class="italic">Aequora lunae</span>. Dedicated to Hepworth, the piece is written for large orchestra and is divided into seven movements, each of which is named after a sea of the moon. The Cheltenham festival commissioned the work, and there it received its premi&egrave;re on 18 July 1967. In 1952 Rainier was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music and in 1953 she helped establish the St Ives festival of arts and composed <span class="italic">Cycle for Declamation</span>, a setting of words by John Donne for solo voice. The cycle was commissioned by Peter Pears, who also gave the first performance of <span class="italic">Requiem</span> for tenor and chorus at the Aldeburgh festival in 1956 and commissioned <span class="italic">The Bee Oracles</span> in 1969. Rainier was made a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1955, and in 1960 she wrote <span class="italic">Phalaphala</span> for the tenth anniversary of Sir Adrian Boult's appointment as music director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Boult conducted the premi&egrave;re on 17 January 1961 but was baffled by Rainier's style. In a letter to the author and violist Bernard Shore, he wrote:<blockquote>I'm afraid I have no opinion of Miss Rainier's effort&#151;I can't make head or tail of it. It was rather good as we had been rehearsing some time, and went on and on with the stuff, when someone said &#145;When is the soloist coming?&#146; A beautifully orchestral remark. (Kennedy, 250)</blockquote>Rainier retired from the Royal Academy of Music in 1961 but remained active as a composer. In the following year she composed the oboe quartet <span class="italic">Quanta</span>, which was recorded by Argo, and in 1963 she was commissioned by the BBC to compose her cello concerto. Performed by Jacqueline Du Pr&eacute; at a Prom in September 1964, the work failed to excite the interest of other performers and promoters and it was soon moribund. But the reception of the concerto did not affect her relationship with the BBC and, with the support of her friend William Glock, the controller of music, her position was unassailable. It is unsurprising, therefore, that the BBC commissioned her <span class="italic">Plo&euml;rmel</span> for the 1973 Proms. In that year, <span class="italic">Vision and Prayer</span> was written with funds from the Arts Council of Great Britain, and four years later she completed <span class="italic">Due canti e finale</span> for violin and orchestra. Yehudi Menuhin commissioned the work and gave its first performance at the Edinburgh festival in September 1977. In 1981 Rainier's <span class="italic">Concertante duo</span> for oboe, clarinet, and chamber orchestra was given its premi&egrave;re, and in June 1982 the University of Cape Town awarded her an honorary DMus. In that year she composed the <span class="italic">Grand Duo</span> for cello and piano, and in 1983 she became the first lady liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians.<br>
<br>Rainier composed approximately thirty works. Though a relatively small <i>&#339;uvre</i> for a career spanning six decades, some of her music was performed by leading musicians. Her works benefited from her originality and her strong musical personality. She did not excel when writing for the orchestra, but her chamber music is of a high standard. The Priaulx Rainier fund for young composers was established by the Royal Academy of Music and the University of Cape Town after her death, and many of her manuscripts and papers are held at those institutions. Priaulx Rainier died at Besse-en-Chandesse, Auvergne, France, on 10 October 1986.<br>
