<span class="headword">Livingstone <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hay]</span>,  Helen</span>, countess of Linlithgow  (<em>d.</em> 1627), <span class="occ">royal tutor</span>, was the only daughter of Andrew Hay, eighth earl of Erroll, and Jean, his first wife. Helen and her brother's financial and marital interests were represented by the king (to whom they were said to be &#145;of kyn&#146;; Pitcairn, 2.546), after her father's second marriage. In 1584 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16801/', "Alexander Livingstone (d. 1621), seventh Lord Livingstone")</script> from 1592 and created earl of Linlithgow in 1600; they had five children, of whom two daughters married in 1609 and 1612.<br>
<br>In 1587 the &#145;Grieves of the Kirk&#146;, presented to James VI, described Lady Livingstone as a &#145;malicious papist&#146;. Her brother Francis [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12715/', "Hay, Francis")</script>] was an active Catholic and their family had had a resident Jesuit priest. She was cited to appear before the presbytery for failure to attend church and confess her faith in 1594 and 1596, but James VI and his wife, Anne of Denmark, entrusted her and her husband to educate their daughters, the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, in 1596. In 1597 she was threatened with excommunication, although a deputation found that she was reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span> daily, and attending church. Nevertheless, the general assembly's concern, both with her recusancy and with her position of influence over the royal daughters, meant that she continued to be targeted for her religious beliefs. In 1601 they cited: &#145;the education of their Majesties' children [in] the company of obstinat and profest Papists sic as the Ladie Livingstoun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Universall Kirk</span>, 3.965) as a major cause &#145;of the deflection from the purity, zeal and practice of true religion&#146;  (ibid.). The king, despite the order to remove his daughters, did not, suggesting that religious affiliations were inconsequential, relative to his daughters' safe care. In 1602 the countess's husband gained her a stay of excommunication so long as he &#145;deal with her at all times carefully for her conversion&#146;  (ibid., 1004). James VI's accession to the English throne in 1603 ended Helen Livingstone's care of his daughters, which may explain the kirk's silence until 1611, when the visitation to the kirk of Linlithgow recorded her recusancy. In 1612 the presbytery called her to appear on an excommunication charge and, despite her non-appearance, enjoined their brethren to &#145;give her public admonition and prayer&#146; to convert. She was described as a kind and hospitable woman by the imprisoned ministers who were lodged at Linlithgow Castle in 1606.<br>
<br>In 1627 Helen Livingstone's daughter, the countess of Wigtown, wrote to John Livingstone, requesting his presence at her mother's deathbed. He wrote afterwards that &#145;[she] had been all her days a papist, but some while before had deserted that religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Relation</span>). She died in 1627 at her daughter's house in Cumbernauld.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The confession and conversion of the right honourable, most illustrious and elect lady, my lady C. of L.</span> (1629), printed by John Livingston (no known relation), gives little flavour of individuality, being an orthodox, conventional confession of Calvinist faith and rejection of Catholicism. The countess speaks of how Catholicism &#145;this many years contented mee, till at last in my old dayes GOD so happily moved my heart to heare the trueth of better and sounder instructers and their warrand&#146;  (sig. B2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), and how she now hopes to hear &#145;a hundreth sermons in GOD's true Kirk&#146;  (sig. B4<i>r</i>). The confession is appended by a collection of psalms and prayers, focusing on the experience of rebirth and salvation. John Livingston claims her words were &#145;most joyfullie, and constantlie uttered and declared before many honourable men and women&#146;  (sig. B7<i>v</i>).<br>
