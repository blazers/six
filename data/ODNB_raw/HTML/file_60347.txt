<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watkinson,  Harold Arthur</span>, Viscount Watkinson  (1910&#150;1995), <span class="occ">businessman and politician</span>, was born on 25 January 1910 at Manor Cottage, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, the elder son in the family of two sons and one daughter of Arthur Gill Watkinson, master draper, and later the owner of a light engineering business, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Casey. The family were of staunch Methodist persuasion, and Watkinson later recalled that the local minister &#145;would go down on his knees, quite naturally, to pray in our sitting room with a simple saintly dignity that touched the heart&#146;  (Watkinson, 3). The minister's son Wilberforce Allen was a Liberal member of parliament and gave the young Watkinson his first lessons in politics. Historically, the Methodist tradition has usually led those of a political bent to espouse the Liberal or the Labour Party, but Watkinson from an early stage was drawn to the Conservative Party. He did not, however, become seriously involved in politics until after the Second World War.<br>
<br>Watkinson was educated at Queen's College, Taunton, and at King's College, London, where he studied engineering. He left without taking a degree and entered the family business at the age of twenty. Outside work, his passion was for climbing. In his autobiography he wrote that at school &#145;I had been one of the instigators of scrambling at night over the high roofs and battlements (that were strictly out of bounds)&#146;  (Watkinson, 4). Later he was encouraged by one of Britain's first professional climbers, Jerry Wright, to take up the activity more seriously. In 1939 he met and became engaged to Vera (Peggy) Langmead, youngest daughter of John Langmead, of Ford, Sussex. When war broke out Watkinson joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve: he had learned to sail on family holidays at Bournemouth and Poole, where he was taught by one of the local fishermen. Before he went on active service he and Peggy decided to get married; they did so on 18 November 1939. They had two daughters, Sarah Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1944) and Rosemary Jane (<i>b</i>. 1947). Watkinson served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve throughout the Second World War. His engineering experience led him inevitably to the Royal Naval Gunnery School, where he was occupied for the whole of the war in the defence of merchant shipping. He ended the war with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>In 1948 Watkinson became chairman of the Dorking Conservative Association. He was selected to stand for Woking in the February 1950 general election and was duly elected. With the return of a Conservative government in October 1951 he was given the junior, non-ministerial job of parliamentary private secretary to the minister of transport and civil aviation. In May 1952, owing to the personal intervention of Winston Churchill, who wanted to promote young men with a sound background in industry, he was appointed parliamentary under-secretary to the minister of labour and national service, Sir Walter Monckton, a post he held until December 1955, when he was appointed to the more senior post of minister of transport and civil aviation, not then a cabinet post. When in January 1957 Harold Macmillan succeeded Sir Anthony Eden as prime minister, he brought Watkinson into the cabinet (still as minister of transport and civil aviation) and in October 1959 promoted him to be minister of defence, where he succeeded Churchill's son-in-law Duncan Sandys. This appointment later led to his political downfall.<br>
<br>Initially, Macmillan thought of Watkinson in the same way as Churchill had: a thrusting young industrialist who could bring fresh life to a government of old men. However, it turned out that there were serious differences of policy between the prime minister and his defence minister. Despite the demise of the British empire, Macmillan believed that a worldwide role for the British armed services could be sustained. Watkinson did not. He was determined that Britain's responsibilities should be reduced, and very sharply so. His view was influenced by his reading of the unhappy episode of Britain's intervention in the Suez War of 1956. In July 1962 Macmillan decided to reshuffle his cabinet. This resulted in the sacking of seven cabinet ministers and numerous junior ministers and came to be known as &#145;the night of the long knives&#146;. In the press it was generally agreed that this was an act of panic in the face of falling Conservative popularity. The dismissal of Watkinson, however, was as much a result of the fundamental difference of opinion between Macmillan and Watkinson, as of the prime minister's desire to bring new blood into his government. In his autobiography Watkinson made it clear that he felt a deep sense of personal hurt at his peremptory&#151;as he saw it&#151;dismissal, and did not dwell on the important policy differences between himself and the prime minister. He was, after all, only fifty-two, and could justifiably have anticipated a long career in government. Most of the other ministers dismissed by Macmillan at that time were elderly, and happy to retire&#151;though one of them, Selwyn Lloyd, made a somewhat spectacular return to politics as speaker of the House of Commons under the prime ministership of Sir Alec Douglas-Home. When in June 1964 Watkinson decided not to stand for re-election to the House of Commons in the general election of October that year, it was Douglas-Home who rewarded him with a viscountcy for his services to government and party.<br>
<br>Watkinson thereupon threw all his considerable energy into business affairs, concentrating on promoting Britain's economic interests abroad. From 1964 to 1970 he was a member of the British National Export Council and from 1964 to 1967 chairman of the Committee for Exports to the United States. For ten years he was a key figure in the British Institute of Management, serving as its chairman from 1968 to 1970, its vice-president from 1970 to 1973, and its president from 1973 to 1978. It was during this time that he published his <span class="italic">Blueprint for Industrial Survival</span> (1976), large parts of which were incorporated into his autobiography, <span class="italic">Turning Points</span> (1986). He was group managing director of Schweppes Ltd from 1963 to 1968, chairman of Cadbury's Schweppes Ltd from 1969 to 1974, a director of British Insulated Callender's Cables from 1968 to 1977 and of Midland Bank from 1970 to 1983, and president of the Confederation of British Industry from 1976 to 1977. He was also a member of the National Economic Development Council from 1976 to 1977. In all his business activities Watkinson followed the policies which he had so passionately espoused during his time in government, of building up Britain's economic potential abroad. While he had differed from Macmillan on the military potential of the United Kingdom overseas, he was convinced none the less that economic power was crucial to his country's future, and he made a worthy contribution to that future. He was a member of the Falkland Islands review committee from 1982 to 1983. He died on 19 December 1995 at his home, Tyma House, Bosham, Chichester, Sussex, of cancer of the prostate. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. There was no heir to the viscountcy.<br>
