<span class="headword">Mauny <span class="st"> [Manny]</span>, Sir  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1310&#150;1372), <span class="occ">soldier and founder of the London Charterhouse</span>, was the fourth of five sons of Jean le Borgne, lord of Masny in the imperial county of Hainault, and Jeanne de Jenlain. The brothers probably passed their youth in the household of Jean de Beaumont, brother of William I, count of Hainault. In December 1327 Mauny came to England as a page in the household of the count's daughter, Philippa of Hainault, the new queen of England, and settled there for the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="Careeratcourt"></a>Career at court</h2>Mauny enjoyed a rapid rise at court. Starting as the queen's trencherman, he became the keeper of her greyhounds. In 1331 he was knighted on the king's command, and retained at a large annual fee as a member of the king's household. Mauny's chance to prove himself as a soldier came in August 1332, when he joined the small private army which invaded Scotland with Edward Balliol and Henry Beaumont, and took part in the remarkable victory over the much larger army of the Scots at the battle of Dupplin Moor. Shortly afterwards, in a skirmish at Roxburgh Bridge, he captured John Crab, the celebrated Flemish seaman and military engineer in Scottish service, whom he later sold to Edward III for 1000 marks. Mauny returned to Scotland in the following year with the English army, and took part in the siege of Berwick. He followed Edward III on the winter campaign of 1334&#150;5 and the equally fruitless march to Perth in July and August 1335. Between June and September 1336 Mauny accompanied the king on his spectacular raid into north-eastern Scotland, which resulted in the destruction of Aberdeen. For part of this campaign he served as Edward's standard-bearer. Almost nothing is known about Mauny's personal contribution to these campaigns, but Jean le Bel says  (1.110) that he distinguished himself by his extravagant gestures and reckless disregard of his own safety, both qualities which were much admired by Edward III.<br>
<br>The king's admiration for Mauny is borne out by the evidence of his growing wealth and influence. Edward appointed him keeper of Harlech Castle and sheriff of Merioneth for life in December 1332, and over the following years he acquired almost viceregal powers in this part of north Wales. Among other favours he received a large part of the Buckinghamshire and Norfolk estates of David Strathbogie, earl of Atholl, in 1335, after the latter's defection to the Scots. He also received valuable patronage from the king's uncle, Thomas of Brotherton, earl of Norfolk, who gave him a pension and appointed him marshal of the king's Marshalsea court.<h2>
<a name="Admiralofthenorth"></a>Admiral of the north</h2>On the outbreak of the war with France, in August 1337, Mauny became admiral of the north. The office, which he held for a year, gave him jurisdiction over all the east-coast ports of England from the Thames to Berwick. Edward III appointed him to command the advance guard of the great army that he intended to dispatch to the Low Countries, and to escort to Holland the cargoes of wool that it was proposed to sell there in order to finance the invasion of France. Mauny sailed from Sandwich at the beginning of November 1337 with a fleet of 85 ships carrying some 1450 troops, 2200 seamen, some prominent wool merchants, and a small group of royal councillors. The operation was conducted with the utmost recklessness. On the way to Holland, Mauny launched a surprise attack on the Flemish port of Sluys, which was repulsed. Then, on 9 November 1337, he landed his men on the nearby island of Cadzand at the entrance to the Hondt, and spent several days in killing and plundering the inhabitants. When the Flemings from the mainland tried to intervene, they were defeated with great slaughter and their commander, Guy, half-brother of the count of Flanders, was captured. Mauny personally made &pound;8000 in ransoms out of this enterprise, but lost many of his men and achieved nothing of any military value. He landed his army and his cargoes at Dordrecht at the end of November 1337, and returned shortly afterwards to England.<br>
<br>As admiral of the north Mauny had the main responsibility for assembling the fleet that carried Edward III to Brabant in July 1338. He himself joined the expedition with a company of 10 knights, 33 squires, and 50 archers, one of the larger personal retinues in the army. In addition he was joined by two of his brothers with their own retinues from Hainault. When, after long delays, the invasion of France eventually began in September 1338, Mauny was determined to be the first in action. As Edward III marched from Valenciennes to Cambrai, he separated himself from the main army and led fifty men on a raid against the undefended town of Mortagne which he plundered and partly burned before withdrawing. On 20 September 1339, as Edward III laid siege to Cambrai, Mauny captured the nearby fortress of Thun-l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que on the Scheldt by bribing the commander. During the next two months he accompanied the king's army in its destructive raid through the Cambr&eacute;sis and the Thi&eacute;rache. Characteristically, on the night of 22 October 1339, the last of the campaign, it was Mauny who led small companies of scouts and men-at-arms past the French lines at Buironfosse, killing sentries and attacking isolated groups of soldiers a few hours before Edward's army retreated northward and dispersed.<br>
<br>Mauny accompanied Edward III's second invasion of the Low Countries in 1340, and fought at the naval battle of Sluys on 24 June. The patriotic poet Laurence Minot sang of him:<blockquote>
<div>Sir Walter the Mawnay, God gif him mede!<br>
</div>
<div>Was bold of body in batayl to bede &hellip;<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 38)</blockquote>The main operation of the campaign was the long, costly, and unsuccessful siege of Tournai, which lasted from 26 July to 25 September 1340. Mauny's contribution to the siege was to lead a succession of lucrative and destructive raids against the towns of the Tournaisis and neighbouring areas of France. When the siege was abandoned, for want of money, he was one of the intimates who shared Edward III's humiliating captivity at the hands of his creditors in Ghent. Mauny lent the king some &pound;4000 in his extremity. He was with Edward when he escaped from the Low Countries in a small boat, and was present at the famous scene in the Tower of London on 30 November 1340, when the king arrived unannounced by the Watergate to confront his ministers in the middle of the night.<h2>
<a name="Soldiering13411347"></a>Soldiering, 1341&#150;1347</h2>In October 1341 Mauny was appointed, jointly with Robert d'Artois, to command the expeditionary force that Edward III intended to send to Brittany to intervene in the war of succession there on the side of John de Montfort against the forces of his French-backed rival, Charles de Blois. This plan was replaced in February 1342 by a more ambitious one, involving the dispatch of no less than three successive English armies to Brittany in the next four months. Mauny was given the sole command of the first of these armies, whose objects were to secure a landing place for the others and to keep the Montfortist cause alive until they could arrive. His mission was not a success. As a result of the delay in requisitioning ships, he arrived at Brest about early May, six weeks later than he had intended, and with only 34 men-at-arms and 200 mounted archers, less than half the force that had been planned. By this time Charles de Blois had already overrun much of Montfortist Brittany. The chronicler Jean le Bel  (1.301&#150;5, 315&#150;22) gives a dramatic account, borrowed and embellished by Froissart, of Mauny's deeds. But it is largely fictional. Mauny's only notable exploit was a raid into Finist&egrave;re to capture Herv&eacute; de L&eacute;on, the principal Breton lieutenant of Charles de Blois, and other valuable prisoners. At about the end of June he made a truce with Charles's representatives and sailed back to England. Edward promptly repudiated the truce and, although Mauny remained in high favour at court, he was never again given an independent military command.<br>
<br>In October 1342 Mauny returned to Brittany with Edward III and the main body of the English army. He was given the dangerous task of reconnoitring the defences of Vannes. He took part in the siege of the city which ended in failure in January 1343. In August 1345 Henry, duke of Lancaster, landed with an English army in Gascony and attacked French positions in the valleys of the Dordogne and the Garonne. Mauny served in this campaign as one of Lancaster's principal subordinate commanders. He took part in the victories at Bergerac and Auberoche and in the capture of La R&eacute;ole, events that turned the tide in favour of the English in the south-west for the next three decades. While he was at La R&eacute;ole, Mauny discovered the grave of his father, who had been murdered there twenty years before on his return from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and had his body disinterred for reburial in the Franciscan convent of Valenciennes. In 1346 he served as one of the captains of Aiguillon during the four-month siege of the place by the army of Jean, duke of Normandy. Mauny led the most dangerous sorties of the siege, and when the duke eventually withdrew, on 20 August 1346, he was the first to invade the abandoned encampment of the French army and plunder what they had left there.<br>
<br>Mauny left the south-west with twenty companions at the end of August 1346 and travelled overland to join the army of Edward III in northern France. This rash enterprise was made possible by a safe conduct from the duke of Normandy which he had bought by remitting the ransom of one of Jean's friends. Even so, Mauny was captured near St Jean-d'Ang&eacute;ly. He escaped from his prison but was arrested again at Orl&eacute;ans and taken under guard to Paris, where he was briefly imprisoned in the Louvre. Several months after his departure he found his way to Edward III's siege works outside Calais.<br>
<br>Mauny played a prominent part in the long siege of Calais. In July 1347, when the English strength reached its peak, he had 326 men serving under him, including 19 knights and 91 squires. Only the king, the prince of Wales, and the earls of Lancaster and Warwick had larger retinues. Mauny was one of the commissioners who represented the king of England in the brief negotiations with the leaders of the French army at the end of July 1347. And, when the negotiations failed and the French left Calais to its fate, it was with Mauny that the garrison asked to speak to negotiate the surrender of the town. He understood the shared values and bonds of mutual self-interest that united men of rank on either side and articulated it as clearly as any of his contemporaries. &#145;By Our Lady,&#146; he is said to have told the king, who was contemplating putting them to death:<blockquote>I tell you that we shall not go so willingly on your service if you kill these men, for they will surely do the same to us on some other occasion when we are doing no more than our duty. (<span class="italic">Chronique de Jean le Bel</span>, 2.162)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Diplomacyadministrationandmarriage"></a>Diplomacy, administration, and marriage</h2>After 1347 Mauny was increasingly drawn into the administrative and diplomatic business of Edward III's government. He served on judicial commissions of oyer and terminer. He sat regularly in the royal council. He was summoned to every parliament between January 1348 and his death, and was regularly appointed to the committees which heard petitions. He was an influential adviser on relations with the Low Countries, where he retained many connections. He was one of Edward III's ambassadors at the diplomatic conferences with the representatives of France and Flanders at Calais and Dunkirk in November and December 1348 and returned to represent the king at the next conference with the French ministers, at Gu&icirc;nes in March 1349. In 1351 Edward sent him to his native Hainault to try to reconcile the dowager empress, Margaret of Hainault, with her son.<br>
<br>Mauny was by now a rich man. In Hainault he had inherited the lordship of Jenlain, south of Valenciennes, from his mother. In 1340 he had obtained a grant of Wasnes from the count of Hainault while both men were engaged in the siege of Tournai. At some time after the death of his elder brothers at the battle of Stavoren in 1345, he succeeded to his family's principal domains at Masny and acquired several castles in the southern part of the county. He continued to receive largess from the king, including property at Calais and in Gascony. In late 1353 or early 1354 he married Edward III's cousin Margaret Marshal [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53070/', "Brotherton, Margaret")</script>], the daughter of his old patron <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27196/', "Thomas of Brotherton")</script> and widow of John Seagrave, thereby temporarily incurring the displeasure of the king, whose licence had not been sought. Margaret, one of the two coheiresses of the earldom of Norfolk, was among the richest women in England. Mauny devoted much effort to the litigious business of getting her considerable domains into his possession.<h2>
<a name="Soldiering13471360"></a>Soldiering, 1347&#150;1360</h2>Mauny's military career was less busy and less well recorded after 1347. Froissart  (4.74, 77, 89) says that he fought with Edward III in the battle beneath the walls of Calais on 2 January 1350 and in the naval battle off Winchelsea on 29 August 1350, but there is no reliable evidence on either point. He certainly took part in the raids across Picardy and the Boulonnais mounted from Calais in the summer of 1351 by the English. But for the remainder of the 1350s he took the field only when the king was in command and his status at court demanded it. In 1355 he fought with Edward in Artois and Picardy. On his return, in November, he acted as the king's spokesman at the opening of parliament, reporting on the diplomatic and military affairs of the past eighteen months. At the beginning of the following year Mauny commanded the advance guard of the army which went north to recapture Berwick from the Scots. He organized a brief and vigorous siege of the town and succeeded in forcing the Scots to surrender within a few days of his arrival. But he took no part in the great campaigns in France in 1356. He was in council with the king when the news arrived of the capture of the king of France by the prince of Wales at the battle of Poitiers.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1359, after the failure of Edward III's attempts to negotiate a treaty with the captive king of France, Mauny was sent to the Low Countries to recruit troops in preparation for the great campaign by which Edward III hoped to force the issue. He recruited a force reckoned at 1500 men in Hainault and the neighbouring principalities of the empire, and led them to Calais in the autumn, where they rioted and did a great deal of damage to the town while waiting for the rest of the army to arrive from England. On the eve of the campaign Mauny became a knight of the Garter. He then accompanied Edward III during the unsuccessful siege of Rheims in December and January, and in the <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> east and south of Paris that followed. In April 1360 he led the attack on the suburbs of the French capital in person.<br>
<br>Mauny's facility for maintaining amicable relations with the enemy no doubt accounted for his inclusion among the delegation chosen to negotiate the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny, which brought this campaign to a close in May 1360. Five months later he was present when the treaty was confirmed at Calais, and when, on 1 November 1360, the king of France was finally released from captivity, he was one of the four knights of Edward III's household on whom Jean II bestowed lavish grants as he left.<br>
<br>For most of the 1360s England and France were at peace, and there is little trace of Mauny's activity. In 1361 he made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and he spent some time in Hainault in 1364. But he remained an active member of the council, close to the king and, increasingly, to the king's ambitious younger son, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. When the war with France broke out again in 1369 Mauny, now some sixty years of age, served as one of the military advisers who accompanied Gaunt's destructive raid through Picardy.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropyandfinalyears"></a>Philanthropy and final years</h2>Mauny's principal enterprise in the last two years of his life was the foundation of the London Charterhouse. This was an old project renewed. The site, beyond the city wall north of Smithfield, had been leased by Mauny from St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1349. He set it aside as a burial-ground for victims of the black death and built a small chapel on it. More ambitious plans were made for a college of priests but never executed. It was Michael Northburgh, bishop of London and former keeper of Edward III's privy seal, who suggested to Mauny the foundation of a charterhouse and asked to be associated with it. When Northburgh died in 1361 he left a contribution of &pound;2000 towards the endowment. After prolonged negotiations with Northburgh's executors and with the general chapter of the Carthusian order in England, Mauny finally bought the site from St Bartholomew's in November 1370. His charter of foundation is dated 28 March 1371. The existing chapel became the church of the new house. The foundations of the conventual buildings were begun almost at once.<br>
<br>Mauny died at his wife's manor at Great Chesterford in Essex on 14 or 15 January 1372, before the new buildings had risen from the ground. By his will, which was made on 30 November 1371, he left a large bequest to the Charterhouse and directed that he should be buried in its chapel in a tomb of alabaster carved with his arms and bearing his effigy dressed as a knight. Although Mauny wished his funeral to be without pomp, it was a great occasion, attended by the king, all his sons who were in England, and a great concourse of prelates and noblemen, as well as by poor men who were entitled under his will to receive a penny each from his executor. John of Gaunt had 500 masses said for the repose of his soul.<br>
<br>Mauny was in some ways the model soldier of his age. He was gallant and courageous. He observed the chivalrous conventions of his class. He was one of the few prominent figures in the early part of the Hundred Years' War to receive unqualified admiration from both sides. But the truth was that he was a poor commander with little strategic grasp, whose military achievements were more spectacular than useful. He was among the first to make a large personal fortune out of loot and ransoms, but he perfectly illustrated Geoffrey de Charney's observation that an excessive interest in ransoms made a poor soldier. He owed his fame in large measure to Jean Froissart who, like Mauny, came from Hainault and to whom Mauny supplied generous gifts and tall stories during the chronicler's visit to England in the early 1360s. &#145;My book is decorated with his deeds&#146;, said Froissart  (8.287).<br>
<br>Mauny was survived by his wife and by a daughter, Anne, aged sixteen at the time of his death, who had married John Hastings, earl of Pembroke.<br>
