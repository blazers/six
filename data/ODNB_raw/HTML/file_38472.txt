<span class="headword">Rycaut, Sir  Peter</span>  (1578&#150;1653), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was born at Antwerp, the son of Andrew Rycaut (son of Peter Rycaut of Brabant) and his Spanish wife, Emerentia, daughter of Garcia Gonsala. He settled in London in 1600 and used his connections in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Low Countries to build up a thriving Mediterranean trade. He also allied himself with leading Dutch merchants in London through his marriage to Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1660), daughter of Roger van der Colge (or Vercolge) and stepdaughter of Walter Artson the elder. Their ten sons and three daughters were baptized between 1611 and 1634; ten children survived into adulthood, including the youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24392/', "Paul Rycaut")</script>. The couple were active in the Dutch, French, and Italian reformed churches in London, as well as in their local Anglican parish of St Christopher-le-Stocks after moving from St Swithin's Lane to Cornhill.<br>
<br>By the 1620s Rycaut was a multiple shipowner, with a controlling interest in the <i>Centurion</i>, <i>St George</i>, <i>St Peter</i>, <i>Peter and Andrew</i>, <i>John and James</i>, <i>Benjamin and John</i>, and other substantial ships. He had also become a merchant banker, corresponding in particular with his Annony relatives in Antwerp and the Spinolas in Genoa, part owners in his ships. He came accordingly under suspicion of being a front for foreign interests, or at least a pawn, vulnerable through his birth as a Spanish subject. In 1621 he lent a large sum to his friend Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador in London, to enable him to purchase and ship to Lisbon 100 pieces of ordnance for the service of the king of Spain. The arrangements for repayment in Portugal failed, and subsequent attempts to recover the debt with interest were to preoccupy the Rycaut family for more than forty years. When their cause was taken up by Cromwell, it was to contribute to the breach with Spain in 1655. In the shorter term Peter Rycaut's attempts to attach goods at Genoa belonging to Gondomar's successor led the Spanish viceroy of Naples to seize his 500 ton flagship, the <i>St George</i>, and Rycaut was suspected of selling her clandestinely to Spain. It took four years to clear his name; but he then defended himself so ably that it proved a turning point in his career.<br>
<br>Henceforth Rycaut's money and contacts were increasingly employed in the government's service. As an agent for the <i>asentistas</i> he helped to arrange that Spanish silver for Flanders, formerly routed via Genoa, was instead brought to Dover, where two-thirds was unladen and reminted in London against bills of exchange redeemable in the Low Countries. This resulted in a regular flow of silver into the kingdom from 1631 to 1647. In 1635 he headed the group of merchants granted a monopoly to import and refine the gold and silver used in the manufacture of wire thread. He invested substantially in the government's West Indies venture of 1636. He was the treasurer of the royal fishing association, at considerable personal loss, while both in his own name and indirectly he lent heavily to the crown in 1639&#150;40. In return he received letters of denization on 27 July 1637 (although his naturalization bill was lost in committee in 1641), and was knighted on 30 April 1641. Shortly afterwards the husband of his eldest daughter, Mary, John Mayney, received a knighthood and baronetcy, and his eldest son, Peter, was contracted to the sister of a crown ward, Viscount Strangford. Rycaut himself had joined the landed gentry in 1639 with the purchase of two fine properties of 500 acres each: The Friars, Aylesford, a former Carmelite priory on the Medway near Maidstone, in Kent; and King's Barns Manor, Upper Beeding, in Sussex, on the Adur beside Bramber Castle.<br>
<br>Rycaut was arrested at The Friars in August 1642 when parliamentary troops led by the notorious Colonel Sandys discovered arms and plate hidden in the roof. He was taken under guard to Upnor Castle and thence to London, where he managed to purchase his release. But in 1643, after raising a royalist troop of five hundred horse and lending &pound;1000 to Sir John Mayney to buy arms in Holland, he had to escape to Rouen, which remained the family's continental base for some years. He was declared a delinquent and his estate sequestered, the first &pound;5000 of his assets going straight to Sir William Waller's army. Over &pound;2000 of this sum was in East India goods; and a further &pound;1600 in the form of a bond by the East India Company (to which he had sold the <i>Peter and Andrew</i>) was also surrendered. Rycaut retaliated with actions to arrest the company's goods in Genoa, Venice, and Leghorn, which gave his friends on the board an excuse to resist further parliamentary demands.<br>
<br>Letters from Rycaut were captured at Naseby in 1645 and he was exempted by name in the Newcastle propositions of 1646 from holding office or approaching the court again. His London house and the priory were both turned into parliamentary magazines, and the latter also served as headquarters for the committee of Kent&#151;plans for recapturing it played a large part in royalist conspiracies. Nevertheless he was allowed in 1647 to return to England, and then to The Friars, and his sequestration was lifted in 1648 after he had taken the covenant and compounded for a sixth of his remaining estate. But in 1650 the family was suspected (rightly) of remitting money to Charles II, and his books were again impounded. He died in Cornhill, London, on 22 February 1653 and was buried on 1 March in the church of St Peter and St Paul at Aylesford, where his wife later joined him. What little remained of his great wealth was mismanaged by his sons, and in 1657 they had to sell The Friars. As they complained at the Restoration, probably with little exaggeration, but to equally little avail, &#145;Sir Peter for his Services and Loyaltie &hellip; was sequestred his houses rifled plundred and his Family turned out of doores, soe that he suffred in his Estate to the value of One Hundred Thousand Pounds&#146;  (SP 29/17, fol. 91).<br>
