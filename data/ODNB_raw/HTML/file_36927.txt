<span class="headword">Williams,  Norman Powell</span>  (1883&#150;1943), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 5 September 1883 at Durham, the eldest son of the Revd Thomas Powell Williams, for many years vicar of St Mary's Church, Tyne Dock, South Shields, and his wife and first cousin, Jane, daughter of Edward Williams, farmer, of Radnorshire. Williams, who was the third of six children but the only one to survive, was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Durham School, and in 1902 he was elected scholar of Christ Church, Oxford. After taking a first class in honour moderations (1904) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1906) he held a prize fellowship at Magdalen College from 1906 to 1909, and during part of that time studied at the universities of Strasbourg and Berlin where he made the acquaintance of C. G. A. V. Harnack and Albert Schweitzer. He was ordained deacon in 1908, on the title of his Magdalen fellowship, and priest in 1909, having in the meantime been elected chaplain fellow of Exeter College.<br>
<br>Williams was a brilliant tutor and lecturer, and was fortunate in having some able pupils, among whom were Geoffrey Fisher (later archbishop of Canterbury) and the Revd Philip Thomas Byard Clayton. His initial discourse to a new pupil was summarized in his chapter &#145;What is theology?&#146; in the book <span class="italic">The Study of Theology</span> (1939), edited by Kenneth Kirk, bishop of Oxford. During the First World War Williams held three appointments as schoolmaster, at Eton College (1916&#150;17), Malvern College (1917), and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (1918&#150;19).<br>
<br>Williams was a notable Bampton lecturer at Oxford for 1924; his lectures were published as <span class="italic">The Ideas of the Fall and of Original Sin</span>. The historical part, which occupied the first six lectures, was a contribution of permanent value, but the last two lectures in which he turned from history to reconstruction, and in which he made great use of the new study of psychology, won less approval. These lectures formed the thesis with which Williams took the degree of doctor of divinity, and in the year in which they were published (1927) he was elected to the Lady Margaret professorship of divinity with a canonry of Christ Church.<br>
<br>Williams devoted much of his time to the improvement of the services and furniture of the cathedral. He was made treasurer of the chapter, and for the last four years of his life was subdean. He was also active in regard to the affairs of the church at large, being intimately concerned with the establishment of communion between the Church of England and the Old Catholic churches in 1932, and with the work of the Westminster Group and the Church Self-Government League. He was one of the first two proctors for Oxford University in the convocation of Canterbury (1936).<br>
<br>Theologically Williams belonged to what is sometimes called the liberal catholic school in the Church of England. In his early life he engaged in some controversy in defence of the traditional belief in the resurrection and in defence of the use of the Athanasian creed. Throughout his life he was particularly concerned with the problem of authority in matters of belief and in public worship. His principal writings in this connection were: <span class="italic">Form and Content in the Christian Tradition</span>, a correspondence with William Sanday, published in 1916; an article, &#145;Tradition&#146;, in James Hastings's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</span> (1926); and &#145;The theology of the Catholic revival&#146; in <span class="italic">Northern Catholicism</span> (edited by him in conjunction with Charles Harris in 1933). At the time of his death he was engaged upon a commentary on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>.<br>
<br>In 1927 Williams married Muriel de L&eacute;risson, daughter of Arthur Philip Cazenove, stockbroker. They had two sons, and three daughters of whom the youngest died in infancy. In manner Williams generally appeared cold and reserved. He was shy and did not make friends easily, while his concise and emphatic manner of speech, combined with a certain impatience of stupid people, made approach to him difficult. In his sermons he was able to give expression more easily to his feelings. He was a most eloquent preacher, admirably lucid, impressive, and stimulating. His writings were marked by an equal lucidity and great power of logic. Williams died at Christ Church on 11 May 1943; he was survived by his wife.<br>
