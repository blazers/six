<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Townley,  Charles</span>  (1737&#150;1805), <span class="occ">collector of antiquities</span>, was born on 1 October 1737 at Towneley Hall, near Burnley, Lancashire, the eldest in the family of three sons and a younger daughter of William Towneley (1714&#150;1742) and his wife, Cecilia (1714&#150;1777), the fifth daughter and eventual heir of Ralph Standish and his wife, Lady Philippa Howard, the daughter of Henry, sixth duke of Norfolk. The spelling Towneley is now usual for both the family and the place, but Charles, his brother Edward, and their mother all signed themselves Townley. <br>
<br>Townley was four when his father died on 2 February 1742, and he did not take control of the estate until he came of age. The family had remained Catholic after the Reformation, and Townley was sent abroad to the English College at Douai, entering with his brother Ralph (1739&#150;1766) in 1747. After leaving Douai in 1753, he was tutored in Paris by the Revd John Turberville Needham and was introduced to Parisian society by an uncle of his father's, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27604/', "Chevalier John Towneley (bap. 1697, d. 1782)")</script>. Having taken possession of Towneley Hall about 1758, he spent some years in the social and sporting activities of a country squire before undertaking the grand tour. <br>
<br>Townley arrived in Rome on 25 December 1767 and stayed until the following August, visiting Naples and Paestum during March. In Rome he began to collect antiquities, especially marble sculptures. Many early acquisitions were mere tourist souvenirs or outright fakes, but he gradually established himself as a serious collector with purchases from the printmaker Giovanni Battista Piranesi and other Roman dealers, and especially from the English dealer in art and antiquities Thomas Jenkins. Shortly before leaving Rome he paid Jenkins &pound;400 for a fragmentary group of two boys quarrelling over a game of knucklebones, <i>Astragalizontes</i>. <br>
<br>During Townley's second and longest visit to Italy, in 1771&#150;4, he spent a year in Rome and nine months based in Naples, and made extended journeys in southern Italy and Sicily. In Naples he acquired from the family of Prince Laurenzano a marble bust traditionally identified as the nymph Clytie, which later appeared with busts of Homer and Pericles on an ornate calling card engraved by William Skelton. In Rome he bought antiquities including sculptures from Jenkins, Thomas Byres, and several Italian dealers, and began to buy direct from the painter and excavator Gavin Hamilton. From 1773 some expensive items were bought on credit from Jenkins, on whose death in 1798 Townley was hard pressed to settle a debt of over &pound;500 with his heir. Among these expensive sculptures were a statue of Diana at &pound;250 and a group with a nymph struggling to escape the attentions of a faun, for which Townley paid &pound;350, perhaps influenced by the group's erotic qualities. Although this work doubtless had a certain piquancy for an eighteenth-century collector, in a British Museum inventory of 1848 the group is annotated &#145;not exhibited&#146;. <br>
<br>After returning to London, Townley corresponded regularly with Jenkins and Hamilton and expanded his collection with purchases from both, especially with sculptures excavated by Hamilton at Monte Cagnolo, Ostia, and elsewhere. Correspondence with Hamilton was sometimes acrimonious, as Townley complained of the quality of the sculptures he sent. With Jenkins he was on better terms: for many years Jenkins supplied Roman gossip as well as sculptures, and Townley undertook purchases in London for him and his friends, obtaining anything from scientific instruments to silk stockings. In 1777 Townley spent another three months in Italy, mainly in Rome, buying as before from Jenkins, Hamilton, and Italian dealers. Following this last trip to Italy the rate of Townley's acquisitions decreased, but he continued to receive consignments of antiquities of all kinds from Jenkins, including a monumental caryatid (BM), similar to one retained for the papal collection, and other sculptures from the Montalto collection at Villa Negroni in 1786 and a Roman marble copy of the bronze discus-thrower (<i>discobolus</i>) by the Greek sculptor Myron (fifth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>), found in Hadrian's villa in 1791. He also bought sculptures, coins, and other antiquities in London, either privately (for example, from Lyde Browne in 1773) or at auction. Over a period of more than twenty years Townley bought at some of the most important public sales of antiquities, among them those of Henry Constantine Jennings (1778), the duchess of Portland's museum (1786), Lord Cawdor (1800), and Lord Bessborough (1801). <br>
<br>From about 1771 Townley lived in a house in Crown Street (now Whitehall). Early in 1778 he moved into 7 Park Street (now 14 Queen Anne's Gate), designed by Samuel Wyatt and built for him by Michael Barrett. Townley was a compulsive collector. A financial summary drawn up in 1779 shows that he had by then spent about &pound;11,600 on his collections and almost as much on successive houses, accounting for almost three-quarters of the &pound;27,700 that he had borrowed on mortgage and bonds. With experience he became discriminating in his purchases, rejecting objects wrongly restored with alien heads. <br>
<br>In 1783 Johan Zoffany painted Townley in the midst of an imaginary arrangement of his sculptures in the library at Park Street, along with the Hon. Charles Greville, Thomas Astle, and Pierre Hugues, better known as the Baron d'Hancarville. Having fallen under the spell of d'Hancarville's over-ingenious speculations on ancient religion and mythology, Townley engaged him to catalogue his marbles and supported him for some years from 1777 with hospitality and frequent &#145;loans&#146;. <br>
<br>Townley was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1786 (and to its council in 1798) and fellow of the Royal Society in 1791. In 1786 he was also elected to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script>, and from 1799 served on a committee appointed to publish engravings and descriptions of <span class="italic">Specimens of Antient Sculpture</span> (drawn largely from his own collection and that of Richard Payne Knight), which eventually appeared in 1809. In 1791 he was elected a trustee of the British Museum, where he influenced the design of the extension planned to house the museum's growing collection of antiquities. <br>
<br>Townley's youthful sojourn in Paris has been seen as the origin of a dissolute lifestyle. To his mother's distress he remained unmarried, but very explicit letters from Richard Payne Knight and various ladies confirm a hint in his travel diary that he led a far from celibate life. He even became a freemason, but towards the end of his life he returned to the practice of his childhood faith. <br>
<br>Townley was reputed a good landlord, considerate of his tenants. He improved the estate, overseeing the planting of many trees, and was involved in the construction of the Leeds&#150;Liverpool canal. In London he lived relatively frugally, having few servants and keeping no carriage (his coach house provided storage for sculptures). He was, however, a generous host, his Sunday dinners being highly praised by the sculptor Joseph Nollekens. Other members of his circle included Sir Joseph Banks, Richard Payne Knight, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Richard and Maria Cosway. <br>
<br>Townley's collection became one of the sights of London. Dr Johnson wrote for an appointment, and in <span class="italic">The Picture of London for 1802</span> visitors to the metropolis were advised to apply at the house to learn the hours of admission to &#145;the finest collection of antique statues, busts, etc, in the world &hellip; collected with the utmost taste and judgment&#146;  (Cook, <span class="italic">The Townley Marbles</span>, 7). While no private collector outside Italy could in fact hope to rival the great Roman collections, it remains true that the Townley marbles could bear comparison with any collection in the noble houses of England, even Lansdowne House and Petworth, both of which included sculptures rejected by Townley's taste and judgement. Visitors were freely admitted to see the collection. Some were given conducted tours by Townley himself; for others from about 1786 he provided manuscript catalogues, which were rewritten as the collection grew and the arrangement changed. <br>
<br>Barred from public life for his religion, Townley devoted much time and energy to learning, but his only publication was an account of an ornate Roman helmet found in 1796 at Ribchester in Lancashire, first issued in 1799, and later appearing in <span class="italic">Vetusta monumenta</span> (4, 1815, 1&#150;11, pl. 1&#150;4). He was also a talented amateur artist. Some of his sculptures are now known only from the drawings he made before disposing of them, and a miniature of the Medici Venus on ivory remains in the possession of the Towneley family. <br>
<br>Townley died without legitimate issue at his house in Park Street on 3 January 1805 and was buried in the family vault at St Peter's Church, Burnley, on 17 January. His estates passed first to his brother Edward Townley Standish (1740&#150;1807), to whom he had already made over the Standish estates when their mother died, and then to an uncle, the bibliophile John Towneley (1731&#150;1813). <br>
<br>In his will, dated 29 November 1802, his marbles were bequeathed to the British Museum, but in a codicil dated 22 December 1804 he left them in trust for his brother or his uncle on condition that a gallery be built to display them either at Towneley Hall or in London, and failing that for the British Museum. John Towneley wished to build a gallery, but Edward was unwilling to undertake the expense, and a compromise was eventually negotiated under which the marbles (including all those mentioned above), with some terracottas and bronzes, passed to the British Museum for &pound;20,000 and (until the passage of the <span class="roman">British Museum Act</span>, 1963) the right to nominate a trustee. After John Towneley's death the small antiquities and drawings were sold to the British Museum by his son Peregrine Edward Towneley (1762&#150;1846). The arrival at the British Museum of more than 300 antiquities transformed its collection. From 1808 the marbles and terracottas were exhibited in a new wing, which had been planned in Townley's lifetime, but within a decade Townley's mainly Roman sculptures, many of them copies of earlier Greek works, were overshadowed by the museum's acquisition of Greek originals, the Bassae frieze and the Elgin collection. New acquisitions were merged with Townley's sculptures, and, although they remained &#145;the nucleus of the Graeco-Roman series&#146;  (Smith, 3.v), it was many years before the intrinsic value of Roman sculptures was fully appreciated, and it was not until 1984 that the museum again had a gallery dedicated to the Townley marbles.<br>
