<span class="headword">Lynn,  George, the elder</span>  (1676&#150;1742), <span class="occ">astronomer and antiquary</span>, was born at Southwick House, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, the second son of George Lynn (1647/8&#150;1682), lord of the manor of Southwick, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1722), the eldest daughter of Walter Johnson of Spalding. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17271/', "Walter Lynn (1677/8&#150;1763)")</script> became a medical writer. George Lynn married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1742), the daughter of Humphrey Bellamy of London; they had two daughters, who died unmarried, and a son, also <a href="#cosubject_17268">George Lynn [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Lynn possessed a 13 foot telescope, with which he made a variety of astronomical observations. Those of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, made in 1724&#150;6 and 1730&#150;35, he sent to the Royal Society. He also sent to the society his account of the aurora borealis of 8 October 1726 and his meteorological register covering the fourteen years up to 1740.<br>
<br>Lynn became in 1719 a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, to which he gave an extensive table of logarithms which he had compiled. With the noted antiquary William Stukeley, he was in 1745 one of the founders of the Brazen-Nose Society, so named after a famous &#145;university&#146; at Stamford, on whose site they met weekly. About this time a ploughman at Cotterstock, a mile from Lynn's house, uncovered a Roman tessellated pavement, of which Lynn and his son prepared a drawing which Vertue engraved for the Society of Antiquaries. Lynn died on 28 June 1742 and was buried at Southwick on 5 July. His son, <a name="cosubject_17268"></a><span class="headword">George Lynn the younger</span>  (1707&#150;1758), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in London. After attending school in Spalding he entered St John's College, Cambridge, and was in 1723 admitted to the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1729. He joined the Spalding Gentlemen's Society in 1723 and the Society of Antiquaries in 1726. He married in 1734 Anne (<i>d</i>. 1767), the eldest daughter of Sir Edward Bellamy of Frinton Hall, Essex, lord mayor of London in 1735, and through her inherited the manor of Frinton. Lynn died childless on 16 May 1758; a handsome monument by Roubilac was erected to him in Southwick parish church.<br>
