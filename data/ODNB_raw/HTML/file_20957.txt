<span class="headword">Ouseley, Sir  William</span>  (1767&#150;1842), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in Monmouthshire, the eldest son of Ralph Ouseley, army officer, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Holland of Limerick. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20955/', "Sir Gore Ouseley")</script>, diplomatist, was his brother. Ouseley was educated privately until 1787, when he went to Paris to study. The following year he became a cornet in the 8th regiment of dragoons. After serving in the 1794 campaign under the duke of York, he sold out and went to Leiden to resume the oriental, and especially Persian, studies which had already fascinated him during his time in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1795 Ouseley published <span class="italic">Persian miscellanies: an essay to facilitate the reading of Persian manuscripts &hellip; with engraved specimens</span>, a treatise on the various styles of Persian handwriting, enriched with many illustrations of manuscripts, and numerous notes showing considerable research. On his return to England in 1796 Ouseley was gazetted major in Lord Ayr's regiment of dragoons stationed at Carlisle, and there he married, on 6 March 1796, Julia, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Irving. They had three daughters and six sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20958/', "Sir William Gore Ouseley (1797&#150;1866)")</script>, diplomatist and writer. Soon afterwards Ouseley took up residence at Crickhowell, Brecknockshire, where he remained until at least about 1820. In 1801 he wrote to the earl of Chichester dwelling on his ambition to become an envoy to some eastern court, and asking the earl to use his influence in procuring a government subsidy and approval for a proposed journey to Persia.<br>
<br>In 1797 Ouseley received the honorary degree of LLD at Trinity College, Dublin, and that of PhD from the University of Rostock. He was knighted in 1800. The Persian journey did not take place until 1810, when Sir William accompanied his brother, Sir Gore Ouseley, as private secretary, on his mission to the shah of Persia. By way of preparation for his eastern observations, he had lived some months in 1810 in the house of the Persian envoy, Mirza Abul Hasan, in London, where he learned to speak Persian. In July of that year they started from Portsmouth on HMS <i>Lion</i> for India and Persia, from where William Ouseley returned to Britain with the new treaty in July 1812. He published his account as <span class="italic">Travels in Various Countries of the East, More Particularly Persia</span> (3 vols., 1819&#150;23), whose title-page states that the author was an honorary fellow of the royal societies of Edinburgh, G&ouml;ttingen, and Amsterdam, and a member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. His valuable collection of Persian manuscripts was offered for sale, and the catalogue, written by himself and printed in 1831, contains notices of 724 manuscripts. Ouseley died at Boulogne in September 1842.<br>
<br>Besides the works already mentioned Ouseley published numerous other books on oriental subjects, notably his <span class="italic">Oriental Collections</span> (3 vols., 1797&#150;9). He translated several works from Persian, including an <span class="italic">Epitome of the ancient history of Persia, extracted from the Jehan Ara</span> of Ahmad al-Kazwini, the author of the <span class="italic">Nigaristan</span> (1799). He also edited volumes by J. L. Burckhardt and contributed extensively to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
