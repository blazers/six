<span class="headword">Lennox, Lord  Nicholas Charles  Gordon</span>  (1931&#150;2004), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 31 January 1931 at 12 Norfolk Crescent, London, the younger son of Frederick Charles Gordon Lennox, ninth duke of Richmond and fourth duke of Gordon (1904&#150;1989), and his wife, Elizabeth Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hudson (<i>d</i>. 1992), youngest daughter of Thomas William Hudson, vicar of Wendover, Buckinghamshire. He spent a happy childhood at Goodwood House, particularly under the influence of his mother, whom he described as the funniest woman he knew. In June 1940 he was sent with his brother to Canada and later to the United States. They became boy scouts in Montreal and learned to sing the &#145;Marseillaise&#146;, a skill that was no doubt useful to him in later life. Later they went to an excellent day school in Princeton, New Jersey, where they learnt to play baseball. They returned to Britain on a battleship in 1943 with some thirty other British boys.<br>
<br>At Eton College and Oxford (entered through an exhibition to Worcester College) Gordon Lennox gave himself a wide education which went well beyond the requirements of examinations. His social success and air of easygoing achievement concealed plenty of hard work and clear thinking. Between his time at these two institutions he carried out his national service as an officer in the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Given his informal attitude to matters of dress and every kind of technical equipment, he was not a natural soldier; but he liked the army and the army liked him, as was shown later by his appointment as honorary colonel of the 4th battalion Royal Green Jackets. He graduated from Oxford with a second-class degree in modern history in 1954.<br>
<br>Gordon Lennox entered the foreign service in 1954. His first overseas posting, from 1957 to 1961, was as private secretary to the ambassador in Washington, where he married (on 14 January 1958) Mary Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1934), daughter of Brigadier Hudleston Noel Hedworth Williamson, army officer; they had three daughters, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1960), Henrietta (<i>b</i>. 1962), and Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1965), and a son, Anthony (<i>b</i>. 1969). From 1961 to 1963 he served as second then first secretary at the British embassy in Santiago. After spells as private secretary to the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office (1963&#150;6) and head of chancery in Madrid (1966&#150;71) he was seconded to the Cabinet Office from 1971 to 1973. He was then head of the news department at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1973&#150;4), head of the North American department (1974&#150;5), counsellor and head of chancery in Paris (1975&#150;9), and assistant under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in charge of cultural and information matters (1979&#150;84).<br>
<br>Apart from his spell in Chile, Gordon Lennox's postings were all close to the centre of policy making, whether in Paris, Washington, Madrid, or the Foreign Office itself. Nevertheless he did not achieve any of the half-dozen or so positions at the very top of the service. Whether this was because he was the son of a duke or because he never pushed himself forward or encouraged others to sing his praises it is hard to say. Because his approach to diplomatic problems was permeated by a gentle sense of humour, it was possible at first to dismiss him as somewhat lightweight. This was not an impression that lasted long among those who experienced his work at close hand. For example he was an outstandingly successful head of chancery in Madrid and then Paris. The task of directing ambassadors without appearing to do so and keeping a widely disparate staff under control was far from easy. He was greatly helped by his wife, Mary. Later he was unexpectedly successful as head of the news department&#151;unexpectedly because no one could accuse him of excessive appetite or admiration for the modern media. Perhaps because he was not temperamentally bewitched or subservient to them, the press offered him their trust, which was the indispensable component of the job. His shrewdness was revealed in another episode when he was under-secretary for cultural and information matters. He drew the attention of Peter Blaker, the minister of state, to the dangers presented by an apparently innocuous international project entitled the &#145;New world information order&#146;. If that project had flourished the results for the freedom of the press from government control could have been formidable. By alerting ministers before it was too late Gordon Lennox helped to muster the necessary opposition to frustrate it.<br>
<br>Gordon Lennox spent the last five years of his career, from 1984 to 1989, as ambassador in Madrid. This was a happy and successful appointment. The steady strengthening of the friendship between Britain and the new Spanish democratic monarchy was reinforced by state visits in both directions. State visits vary a good deal in importance but between Britain and Spain at this stage they had real political substance. Gordon Lennox and his wife moved in this world of court and ceremony with ease and assurance. But always in the background was the painful dispute over Gibraltar, which if not skilfully handled by both sides could at any time have burst into the foreground and spoiled the whole relationship. No one could accuse Gordon Lennox of &#145;going native&#146; or in any way failing to uphold the British case. But with his advice British ministers handled the matter with tact and care. The question of sovereignty could not be dodged but could be discussed amicably at intervals under the so-called Brussels process, without calling into question all the other matters on which Britain and Spain needed to work together. He was knighted KCMG in 1986 and KCVO in 1989 (having been appointed LVO in 1957 and CMG in 1978), but continued to be known as Lord Nicholas Gordon Lennox, the inherited title taking precedence.<br>
<br>After his retirement Gordon Lennox took up several financial appointments and also became a director of Sothebys and a governor of the BBC. He developed his skill as a watercolourist and until his final illness thoroughly enjoyed life at South Nore, Snow Hill, West Wittering, on the sea below Chichester, surrounded by his wife, children, and a great circle of friends. This was a house of much friendship and laughter. He died there on 11 October 2004 of bronchopneumonia and prostate cancer and was survived by his wife, Mary, and their four children. A service of thanksgiving was held at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 19 January 2005, and another, attended by an extraordinary gathering of Spanish notables, at the protestant church in Madrid.<br>
