<span class="headword">Dunne <span class="st"> [Donne]</span>,  Gabriel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1490&#150;1558), <span class="occ">abbot of Buckfast</span>, was one of four surviving children of Angel Donne, grocer and alderman of London (<i>d</i>. 1506), and therefore belonged to a leading city family. His father's will of 1505 describes Gabriel as a monk and implies that he was still an adolescent, since it provides a sum of &pound;10 to finance his education at a university. He was probably already a member of the Cistercian abbey of Stratford Langthorne, Essex, to which he belonged by 1517, and whence he proceeded to the order's college of St Bernard, Oxford. There he supplicated for the degree of BTh on 26 October 1521, on the ground of having studied logic, philosophy, and theology for twelve years, a course of instruction that may have begun at Stratford. On 28 March 1530 he matriculated at the University of Louvain, perhaps in order to earn a doctorate in theology, but it is not certain that he received such a degree, although the London writer Henry Machyn refers to him as a doctor at the time of his death.<br>
<br>In May 1535, when Dunne was still living in Louvain, the English cleric Henry Phillips succeeded in decoying the <span class="roman">Bible</span> translator, William Tyndale, from Antwerp into the hands of the authorities in the Netherlands, an event that led to Tyndale's execution. In the following month Dunne left Louvain to become abbot of the Cistercian abbey of Buckfast, Devon, thanks to the patronage of Thomas Cromwell. These events caused nineteenth-century historians to portray Dunne as Phillips's active confederate in the betrayal of Tyndale, and to interpret his abbacy as a reward for his service, but the evidence to support such conjectures is lacking. Thomas Theobald, who wrote from Antwerp on 31 July 1535 to his godfather Archbishop Cranmer, does indeed say that Phillips and Dunne lived in the same house in Louvain. He also states that Phillips told him that Dunne was his sole confidant in the plot, but that was merely Phillips's assertion. Phillips was hostile to Henry VIII and fearful of Cromwell, whereas Dunne enjoyed Cromwell's favour, making it unlikely that they took part in a joint plot, and Dunne's promotion to Buckfast is as plausibly ascribable to his learning and family connections. In 1524 his sister Elizabeth had married Sir Thomas Denys, a leading Devon magnate who was also a close associate of Thomas Cromwell. Dunne's promotion to Buckfast strengthened the influence of Cromwell and Denys in Devon, and Dunne had good relations with Cromwell in later years. There was eventually a marriage between Dunne's niece Frances Mirfin and Cromwell's nephew Richard Williams, alias Cromwell.<br>
<br>Dunne and his fellow monks surrendered Buckfast Abbey to Henry VIII on 25 February 1539, and he received the generous pension of &pound;120 a year. He subsequently settled in London and pursued a career as a secular priest, becoming a canon of St Paul's Cathedral and prebendary of Mapesbury in 1541; rector of Stepney, Middlesex, in 1544, on the presentation of Richard Williams; and rector of Langtree, Devon, in 1549, on that of his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Denys. In the latter year Cranmer appointed him &#145;keeper of the spiritualities&#146; (the acting head) of the diocese of London, following the deprivation of Edmund Bonner as bishop. His death took place on 5 December 1558, and he was buried three days later before the high altar of St Paul's Cathedral, beneath a tombstone inscribed with eight lines of Latin verse. He died as a man of some property, including the advowson of Grantham church, Lincolnshire, and gave generously to charities in his will, dated 5 February 1558. He bequeathed to his former college of St Bernard, recently refounded as St John's College, such of his books as his executors should approve; forty-five volumes were later delivered to St John's, including works of classical literature and theology. The residue of his goods was willed to provide dowries for poor maidens and support for poor scholars and students, especially those intending to become priests. One of his executors, Henry Harvey, used &pound;120 from this source to found a scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and to hold a commemoration on St Nicholas's day in memory of Dunne's death. Dunne's will also made bequests to provide silver plate for the high altar of St Paul's Cathedral, an iron railing to fence off the laity from the sanctuary, and an altar or monument commemorating the Archangel Gabriel's salutation to the Virgin Mary. This suggests that he took a close interest in the restoration of the cathedral to Catholic worship under Mary Tudor, and that he died an adherent of the faith in which he had spent the greater part of his life.<br>
