<span class="headword">Falconbridge,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1760&#150;1792), <span class="occ">doctor and slavery abolitionist</span>, whose family was associated with Bristol, where he grew up, spent twelve months in 1779&#150;80 as a pupil in Bristol Infirmary. Too poor to start his own practice, he became a surgeon on board a slave ship&#151;a potentially lucrative employment since surgeons received, as well as their salary, 1<i>s</i>. a head per slave landed, and the chance of eventually becoming a ship's captain. Between 1780 and 1787 he sailed on four ships which took him along the west coast of Africa, chiefly to the Niger delta, and to the Caribbean. On his first two voyages he served under a captain whom he later described as one of the best in the trade. Then, under a brutal captain named Mactaggart, he became sickened by its conditions. In 1787 he left it in disgust and went back to working as a pupil with a Bristol doctor.<br>
<br>In spring 1787 Thomas Clarkson, one of the founders of the committee for effecting the abolition of the slave trade, went to Bristol to gather evidence. Falconbridge, alone among those he questioned, was courageously ready to testify publicly to the horrors of the traffic in slaves. He accompanied Clarkson to Liverpool to gather more information, and also to act as his bodyguard&#151;Clarkson called him &#145;an athletic and resolute-looking man&#146;  (Clarkson, 1.318)&#151;then to London to report his findings to the committee. He also gave evidence to a privy council committee, and underwent four days of hostile grilling by a House of Commons committee. With the help of Richard Phillips, an abolitionist lawyer, he reduced his voluminous material to a substantial pamphlet, published in 1790 as <span class="italic">An Account of the Slave Trade, on the Coast of Africa</span>, the first piece of published abolitionist propaganda. He sold the copyright to the abolition committee which printed 6000 copies, and with the proceeds set up as a doctor at Lodway, near Bristol. There on 16 October 1788 he married Anna Maria Horwood (<i>b</i>. 1769) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9105/', "Falconbridge, Anna Maria")</script>].<br>
<br>In 1790 Clarkson recruited Falconbridge to go out to Sierra Leone on behalf of the St George's Bay (renamed later Sierra Leone) Company, a company that blended commercial profit with abolitionist philanthropy, to refound a colony of free black settlers, established there three years earlier, but dispersed after a quarrel with their Temne neighbours. His wife accompanied him, and in 1794 was to describe their experiences in her <span class="italic">Narrative of Two Voyages</span>. A passionate abolitionist, he quarrelled with the local slave traders, but managed to reassemble the dispersed settlers, and to persuade Naimbana, the Temne ruler, to let them return. He and his wife then sailed home in a tiny boat, narrowly escaping shipwreck.<br>
<br>The Sierra Leone Company was controlled by its chairman, Henry Thornton, a London banker. Realizing that Falconbridge, with his knowledge of the country, was indispensably necessary to the project, Thornton tempted him to return as commercial agent with a &pound;300 salary, even though he knew he had no commercial experience. Falconbridge accepted, returned with his wife, and got Naimbana to approve the foundation of what was now named Freetown. The company's employees soon began quarrelling and all was in confusion until order was restored by Clarkson's brother John, a naval lieutenant, who arrived from Nova Scotia in 1792 with over a thousand black American loyalist settlers, and was eventually appointed governor.<br>
<br>During the first months many settlers fell ill. Mortality was high and Falconbridge was active as a doctor. But he made no attempt, as commercial agent, to initiate trade with the neighbouring peoples. He had by now taken heavily to drink: even on the voyage out, at Tenerife, he had been noisily and publicly drunk. Thornton saw him as expendable and sent out a new commercial agent to replace him. A few days after the new agent's arrival at Freetown, Falconbridge, now in a state of almost permanent intoxication, died, on 19 December 1792, in Freetown, where he was buried.<br>
<br>Falconbridge's reputation suffered posthumously. Thornton singled him out as a scapegoat in his published report on the colony (1794), making him responsible for its early misfortunes, while his widow presented him in her <span class="italic">Narrative</span> in a most unfavourable light. Both thus diminished the memory of his courageous pioneer achievements in the campaign against the slave trade.<br>
