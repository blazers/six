<span class="headword">Braybrooke,  Neville Patrick Bellairs</span>  (1923&#150;2001), <span class="occ">writer and editor</span>, was born at 22A Devonshire Street, London, on 30 May 1923, the only child of Patrick Philip William Braybrooke, journalist and biographer, and his first wife, Lettice Marjorie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bellairs (1890&#150;1986), who had been a nurse before her marriage. His father left his mother when Braybrooke was three; by his father's second marriage Braybrooke had a half-sister, whom he met in later years. He did not see his father again until a chance encounter in the 1950s. He was brought up by his mother, who after her conversion to Roman Catholicism had her son rebaptized in that faith, giving him the additional names of Ignatius Anthony. He was educated at St Benedict's School, Ealing, and at Ampleforth College, where his fees were paid by a woman friend of his mother and he was one of the poorer pupils.<br>
<br>At Ampleforth, Braybrooke showed a keen interest in literature and the theatre. In his last year he became an associate editor of a little magazine, <span class="italic">The Wind and the Rain</span>, founded originally in aid of the Red Cross by a fellow pupil, Michael Allmand, who was subsequently killed in the Second World War. After he left school Braybrooke continued to edit this. Called up into the army, he served as a private in the Royal Army Service Corps. Because of the ill health of his mother, in 1943 he was given a compassionate posting to Kensington barracks, opposite his home in Kensington Church Street. At this time he formed a close attachment to Elizabeth King (later Elizabeth Rosenberg), sister of the novelist Francis King. She worked with him on <span class="italic">The Wind and the Rain</span>, co-edited two volumes of translated verse, and founded with him a small publishing firm, the Phoenix Press. This issued for the first time in England the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi, <span class="italic">The Story of my Experiments with Truth</span> (1949), for which they had high hopes. Unfortunately sales were very small, and after a few years the Phoenix Press had to close. Braybrooke continued to edit <span class="italic">The Wind and the Rain</span> as a quarterly until 1951. For a time he also worked on a political and economic magazine, <span class="italic">Soundings</span>.<br>
<br>In 1953, with the help of his mother, Braybrooke bought a small house, partly occupied by tenants, in Gardnor Road, Hampstead. On 5 December 1953 he married June Guesdon Orr-Ewing, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jolliffe (1920&#150;1994), the writer Isobel English [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54948/', "Braybrooke, June Guesdon")</script>]. Although she was divorced, by a technicality they were able to marry in the Roman Catholic church, of which Braybrooke was a communicant member all his life. There were no children of the marriage, but Braybrooke had a stepdaughter, Victoria Orr-Ewing (<i>b</i>. 1943). In 1969 they bought Grove House, Castle Road, in Cowes, Isle of Wight, and divided their time between this handsome but ramshackle house and the one in London. After his wife's death in London on his birthday, 30 May 1994&#151;he wrote a poem, &#145;Two Birthdays&#146;, in 1995&#151;Braybrooke was eventually persuaded to sell the Hampstead house and thus for the first time in his life to have money. With characteristic generosity and family feeling he bought houses in Yorkshire for both his stepgranddaughters, while he continued to live in Cowes with his stepdaughter.<br>
<br>Braybrooke's first publication was a small volume about London, <span class="italic">This is London</span>, in 1953. This was followed in 1959 by <span class="italic">London Green</span>, about the London parks, and his only novel, <span class="italic">The Idler</span> (which was not a success) in 1961. A play for the BBC, <span class="italic">The Delicate Investigation</span>, followed in 1969, and poems in 1986, 1989, and 1995. At the time of his death he had just completed a biography of the novelist Olivia Manning, a close friend, on which he and his wife had been working together for some years. He contributed articles and reviews to <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>. Many of these were syndicated in periodicals in other countries. In 1958 he edited a symposium for the seventieth birthday of T. S. Eliot; in 1960 <span class="italic">A Partridge in a Pear Tree: a Celebration for Christmas</span>; in 1962 <span class="italic">The Wind and the Rain: an Easter Book</span>; in 1966 <span class="italic">Pilgrim of the Future: a Teilhard de Chardin Symposium</span>; in 1975 <span class="italic">The Letters of J. R. Ackerley</span>; and in 1989 <span class="italic">Seeds in the Wind: 20th Century Juvenilia from W. B. Yeats to Ted Hughes</span>.<br>
<br>As a magazine editor Braybrooke was inspired, securing as his contributors not only little-known or promising writers, but also many distinguished ones, who contributed for a pittance. His later editing, for instance of the Ackerley letters, was slow but meticulous. As a writer his output was small. Many years of research went into the life of Olivia Manning, and the writing of it was very slow, but it was published late in 2004.<br>
<br>In later life the ambitious, go-ahead, and industrious young man became the leisurely, unworldly man of letters. Braybrooke was very widely read, the owner of a vast library, with a quirky interest in the odd, the out-of-the-way, and the little known&#151;reflected in the annual Christmas alphabets which for several years he contributed to <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, the fruit of much reading and ingenuity. As a young man he was willowy&#151;his mother used to say that a puff of wind could blow him away&#151;and very good-looking, indeed beautiful. In later life he became very overweight, lame, and arthritic, but never lost his look of boyish innocence or his charm. He was a devoted son, husband, and stepfather, and a kind and generous-spirited friend to many. Early in 2001 it was clear that he was far from well, but he refused to seek medical advice until he had completed his last book. When finally he did so, cancer was diagnosed, and he died, after surgery, at St Mary's Hospital, Newport, Isle of Wight, on 14 July 2001. A requiem mass was celebrated on 25 July in St Thomas of Canterbury Church, Cowes, and he was buried the next day, 26 July, in his wife's grave in Hampstead cemetery. He was survived by his stepdaughter.<br>
