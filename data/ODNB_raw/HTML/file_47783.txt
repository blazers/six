<span class="headword">Heath,  John Benjamin</span>  (1790&#150;1879), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born on 6 June 1790 at Genoa, Italy, the eldest son in a family of two sons and three daughters of John Heath (1749&#150;1830), a merchant, and his wife, Jane Louise Pasteur (1736&#150;1834). His father came from a nonconformist family which during the 1720s had been involved in the west-country wool trade. This Exeter family had religious and filial ties with continental Europe, and in 1764 John Heath was apprenticed to Doxat et Aubert of Genoa. In 1774 he became a partner in Robert Aubert et Cie of Geneva&#151;his mother, Rose Mary Michelet, having connections with this city's Huguenot community. Charles Heath followed his brother John, and in 1781 went to Genoa, where he was joined in a business partnership by Lyle Gibbs of Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons. In 1798 John Heath established the London house of Heath &amp; Co. In consequence of all these trading and social links, Heath &amp; Co. became one of the Anglo-European mercantile houses responsible for the transmission of funds from England to Austria during the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.<br>
<br>John Benjamin Heath attended Harrow School (1798&#150;1806) and for a time was fag to Lord Byron. He then entered his father's business, and in 1816 was appointed consul-general for the kingdom of Sardinia, a reflection of the firm's commercial ties with northern Italy. During the first half of the nineteenth century Heath &amp; Co. became an established part of the City. This can be traced through the positions held by John Benjamin Heath, who was chairman of both the London Life Association and the Society of Merchants Trading to the Continent; most importantly, he was a director of the Bank of England for fifty years. A member of the bank's internal committee of 1838 which considered the restructuring of its business, he served as deputy governor between 1842 and 1845. No doubt because of his deep involvement in the preparation and first consequences of the 1844 <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span>, in 1845 Heath was appointed governor of the bank in succession to William Cotton.<br>
<br>A man of wide-ranging interests, Heath was master of the Grocers' Company in the City of London in 1829, and in the same year he published <span class="italic">Some Account of the Company of Grocers</span>. An accomplished musician and linguist, he was active in literary and archaeological circles. He was a member of the Roxburghe Club and also of the Dilettante Society.<br>
<br>In 1811 Heath married Sophia (1793&#150;1863), the daughter of Robert Bland MD, of London. The couple had a large family, of whom four sons and three daughters survived their parents. Heath was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1832 and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1843. A barony in the kingdom of Italy was bestowed on him in 1867 (and later inherited by his eldest son). His wife predeceased him in 1863, and was buried in a vault at Highgate cemetery. He was laid to rest alongside her following his own death, on 16 January 1879 at 66 Russell Square, London.<br>
<br>Heath's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_48554"></a><span class="headword">Robert Amadeus Heath</span>  (1818&#150;1882), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was born in London on 12 December 1818. He was educated at Harrow School and shared a number of his father's interests: in 1879 he was elected a member of the Roxburghe Club. In 1847 he married Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1826), the daughter of Thomas Keen of Croydon and Coulsdon, Surrey; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Robert Amadeus Heath entered the family firm in 1837, where he was the junior partner until his father's death in 1879. During the mid-nineteenth century Heath &amp; Co. remained important in Anglo-Italian trade, with Robert appointed vice-consul of Sardinia in 1844. The firm developed into a merchant bank through Heath's interest in Russian state finance and then Brazilian affairs, marked by his becoming chairman of the S&atilde;o Paulo Railway in 1861, three years after its establishment. Heath &amp; Co. was located at 31 Old Jewry in the City, and it was there in May 1863 that the informal and private meetings were held that led to the creation of the International Financial Society (IFS), one of the first English corporate investment banks.<br>
<br>The first initiative came from a French merchant bank, Cr&eacute;dit Mobilier; however, a group of leading bankers and financiers from the City of London decided to establish their own independent concern. This was chaired by Heath, and involved the participation of a number of City firms, including Robert Benson &amp; Co., Samuel Dobree &amp; Sons, Fruhling and Goschen, Frederick Huth &amp; Co., George Peabody &amp; Co., Stern Brothers, and Heath &amp; Co. An interest in art led Heath, together with Sir William Drake, a City solicitor, and Sir Austen Henry Layard, the archaeologist who, with Drake, had been responsible for the creation of the Ottoman Bank in 1856, to resuscitate the Venetian glass trade. This eventually resulted in the formation of the Venice and Murano Glass and Mosaic Company to safeguard future production.<br>
<br>Most of Heath's business life from 1863 was devoted to the affairs of the IFS, and from 1865 he became the linchpin of its permanent management committee. During 1863 he had overseen the society's reconstitution and reflotation of the Hudson's Bay Company. He conducted the society's ill-fated involvements in the Italian Land Company and the Italian Building Society, property companies which were to rebuild Turin as Italy's capital, and, similarly, he worked with the merchant bank Glyn Mills to float the loan that financed the emperor Maximillian's bid for a Mexican empire.<br>
<br>The IFS was a major force in the City during the boom of the mid-1860s, but the investment bank fell prey to the 1866 crisis, and for fourteen years thereafter Heath was largely responsible for its reconstruction, a task which at times, as in 1872, he found &#145;irksome&#146;. He was thus obliged to run the English Erie Committee between 1869 and 1871. The objective of this association was both to protect British investors' interests and to dislodge Jay Gould from the management of the Erie Railroad Company in an episode that has been dubbed the &#145;Erie wars&#146;. More positive was Heath's role as a founder of the Syndicate Union during the early 1870s, which institutionalized the relationships between the IFS, the Ottoman Bank, and the Anglo-Austrian Bank.<br>
<br>On the death of his father Robert Heath succeeded to the family's Italian barony. It would appear that he had lived largely under his father's shadow and the chairmanship of the IFS had been the only major outlet for his considerable energies, together with his chairmanship of the S&atilde;o Paulo Railway and a directorship of the Royal Exchange Assurance. There is every indication that Heath's business career over its last sixteen years was one of disappointment. The family firm never regained, during John Benjamin Heath's declining years, the status that it had held during the mid-century, and although Robert Amadeus Heath nursed the IFS back into liquidity, his early death prevented him from capitalizing on this considerable success.<br>
<br>Robert Heath died at 42 rue des Mathurins, Paris, on 5 June 1882, survived by his wife, and was buried at Highgate cemetery, Middlesex.<br>
