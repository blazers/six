<span class="headword">Perceval,  Alexander</span>  (1787&#150;1858), <span class="occ">politician and serjeant-at-arms of the House of Lords</span>, was born on 10 February 1787 at Temple House, Ballymote, co. Sligo, the second son and eventual heir of the Revd Philip Perceval, who succeeded his elder brother Guy Carleton Perceval in the family estates in 1792, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Alexander Carroll of Dublin. The first of the family to migrate from Somerset to Ireland had been <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21914/', "Richard Perceval (c.1558&#150;1620)")</script>, who as the confidential agent of Lord Burghley was credited with deciphering the communications which gave the first intelligence of the Armada. Philip Perceval had died by the time his son Alexander entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 7 November 1803  (Burtchaell &amp; Sadleir, <span class="italic">Alum. Dubl.</span>, 662); the latter's landed inheritance in co. Sligo, where he largely resided, was a substantial one, and he later became an active justice of the peace. On 11 February 1808, the day after he came of age, Perceval married Jane Anne (<i>d</i>. 1847), eldest daughter of Colonel Henry Peisley L'Estrange of Moystown, King's county. They had a large family, of whom four sons and six daughters survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Perceval was lieutenant-colonel of the Sligo militia from 1809 until 1851. At the general election of 1831 he was returned to parliament for co. Sligo after a contest. He was re-elected unopposed in 1832 and 1835, was again victorious in a contest in 1837, and came in without opposition in 1841. As &#145;an earnest and zealous Conservative&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 3rd ser., 6, 1859, 209), he opposed the Grey ministry's reform bills, and as a member of the Orange Association of Ireland he was in the minority against the grant to the Catholic college of Maynooth of 26 September 1831. In January and February 1832 he was prominent in successful protests in the Commons against the practice whereby the Irish lord chancellor exacted fees from justices of the peace for the renewal of their commissions on a demise of the crown  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 9.794, 10.33&#150;45). A founder member of the Carlton Club in March 1832  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 March 1832), he was treasurer of the ordnance in Sir Robert Peel's first administration from December 1834 until April 1835. The following year he acquiesced and aided in the dissolution of the Orange Association, of which he was by then treasurer, at the behest of the Melbourne ministry  (BL, Add. MS 40424, fol. 267). During his ten-year Commons career he was a regular speaker, mostly on Irish subjects: some 500 interventions by him were reported. When Peel formed his second administration in September 1841 he appointed Perceval a lord of the Treasury, having been unable to effect a preferred arrangement to place him in the household  (BL, Add. MS 40487, fol. 356). Perceval held the post for only twelve days before replacing Admiral Sir George Seymour as serjeant-at-arms of the House of Lords, which obliged him to relinquish his seat.<br>
<br>Perceval, who was created a DCL of the University of Oxford on 13 June 1834, served the upper house capably for more than seventeen years until his death, after &#145;two attacks of paralysis&#146;, at his home, 28 Chester Street, London, on 9 December 1858. He was described in an obituary as &#145;a highly educated gentleman, full of Irish humour and well-told anecdote&#146;, whose &#145;temper was one of deep unfeigned devotion&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 3rd ser., 6, 1859, 209).<br>
