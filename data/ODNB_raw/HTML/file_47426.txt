<span class="headword">Wright,  Thomas</span>  (1839&#150;1909), <span class="occ">engineer and social commentator</span>, was born on 12 April 1839 in Burlington Street, Liverpool, the eldest of at least three sons of Charles Wright, a blacksmith, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McArla. He attended local schools until the age of fourteen when he began a seven-year apprenticeship as an engineer. Once this was completed he set out on a particularly extensive version of the traditional &#145;tramp&#146; around manufacturing centres in the north, midlands, and south of England, eventually settling in London where he lived in a series of rented properties in the more respectable parts of Deptford. At first he continued to work at his manual trade in the blacksmith's shop of a medium-sized engineering firm in Gravesend. He seems to have been a fairly active member of the appropriate trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, but was less interested in union or political affairs than in pursuing his own course of self-education through extensive reading and debates in the local Mechanics' Institute. By 1872 this equipped him to pass the relevant examinations and become one of the area's first school board visitors appointed under the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, staying in this reasonably secure, but not particularly well paid, non-manual position until his retirement in 1906.<br>
<br>By the time of his transition into the lower middle classes, Wright had already established himself as an authoritative commentator on the ways of life of his colleagues among the manual working classes. Writing under the pseudonym of the Journeyman Engineer, he had begun with descriptive and anecdotal pieces for literary journals, such as the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, but was soon working under his own name and producing sustained analyses for more heavyweight periodicals, above all the liberal and social-reforming <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. As a result of the increasing public interest in the implications of the extension of the franchise and the rise of the trade unions, combined with his unique position as a highly literate participant observer, most of his essays were immediately collected into three substantial volumes: <span class="italic">Some Habits and Customs of the Working Classes</span> (1867), <span class="italic">The Great Unwashed</span> (1868), and <span class="italic">Our New Masters</span> (1873).<br>
<br>Wright's approach was characterized by a typology of ranges of behaviour in each distinct area of experience, avoiding both simple polarization and the temptation to consolidate his findings into an overarching total structure. As his work contained sympathetic and thoughtful coverage of all aspects of life, from workplace customs and gender roles to popular leisure and political attitudes, it has subsequently been widely cited by historians of the period. Meanwhile, he was also busy on three novels, the first of which, <span class="italic">Johnny Robinson: the Story of the Childhood and Schooldays of an &#145;Intelligent Artisan&#146;</span> (1868), was apparently widely read at the time, but more for its autobiographical content than for its narrative power.<br>
<br>Once employed as a visitor by the local school board, Wright was exposed to what was for him a whole new milieu: that of the poorer, casual labourers living in overcrowded slum dwellings along the banks of the River Thames. His social commentary therefore turned in this direction with a flow of articles under a new pseudonym, the Riverside Visitor, many for the social-reforming magazine <span class="italic">Good Words</span>. Although he was something of a pioneer in this field before it was a subject of much public attention, his essays were soon collected in two volumes as <span class="italic">The Great Army: Sketches of Life and Character in a Thames-side District</span> (1875). Almost twenty years later, when there was more widespread interest and a serious public debate about social conditions in the capital, he was well-placed to produce a further volume, <span class="italic">The Pinch of Poverty: Sufferings and Heroism of the London Poor</span> (1892). As with his earlier work on the better-paid and more respectable groups among the manual working classes, Wright's essays on the poor contained detailed descriptions of housing conditions and ways of life, and approached their subjects as generally decent, hard-working and often religious, if not churchgoing, people who helped each other more than they were helped by the rest of society. In the ambitious multi-volume survey of metropolitan poverty, <span class="italic">Life and Labour of the People in London</span> (1902), Charles Booth made use of reports from school board visitors, so it seems likely that Thomas Wright was the source of some of the evidence which was included for the Deptford area.<br>
<br>Around the time he moved into white-collar work, Wright married, on 28 March 1872, Matilda Hopkins (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Rogers), a widowed dressmaker already living at the same address with her young son. It does not seem that they had any more children together, but are recorded in the census as sharing accommodation with his niece, or living in flats in multiple-occupancy houses. Not long after his retirement Wright died of a stroke at his home, 46 Tyrwhitt Road, Deptford, on 19 February 1909.<br>
