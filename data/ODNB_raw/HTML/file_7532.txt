<span class="headword">Dering,  Heneage</span>  (1665&#150;1750), <span class="occ">dean of Ripon and Latin poet</span>, was born in St Bride's parish, London, on 7 February 1665 and baptized on 14 February, the eldest of four sons and five daughters of Christopher Dering (1625&#150;1693), barrister of the Inner Temple, of Wickins in Charing parish, Kent, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1724), daughter and heir of Thomas Spackman of Wiltshire. Heneage was named after his father's friend and patron, Heneage Finch, later earl of Nottingham, who was also his godfather; from 1673 Christopher Dering acted as Finch's secretary. He was educated at St Edward's Grammar School in St Albans (1674&#150;8), where he was taught by Charles James, a former pupil of Richard Busby at Westminster School. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1678, and as a pensioner to Clare College, Cambridge, in 1680, leaving in 1682 without taking a degree. In February 1683 his father bought him a set of chambers in Figtree Court, Inner Temple, for &pound;140, and Heneage was called to the bar in 1689  (Inderwick, 260) or 1690  (Dering, 338). In 1691 he became secretary to John Sharp, chaplain to Heneage Finch, on his promotion to the archbishopric of York, and in 1692 took up residence at Bishopthorpe Palace.<br>
<br>Early in 1701 Dering decided to take holy orders and, with this object in mind, he was created LLD of Clare College, <i>per literas regias</i>, in January 1701. On 9 February he was appointed Sharp's chaplain on being ordained deacon in Bishopthorpe Chapel, and was ordained priest on 20 July. Preferment after preferment now followed through Sharp's patronage. He was archdeacon of the East Riding (1702&#150;50) and a canon of York Minster, holding the prebend of Grindal from 1705 and the richer one of Fridaythorpe from 1708. He was instituted to the rich rectory of Scrayingham, East Riding, where he rebuilt the parsonage house for the resident curates, in 1704, and to the deanery of Ripon on 3 March 1711. In June 1712 Sharp appointed him master of the hospitals of St Mary Magdalene and St John the Baptist in Ripon. Since, on his father's death, he had inherited the manor of Wickins, and the family estates in Westwell, Kent, he had become one of the wealthiest clergymen in England. He married, at Bishopthorpe Chapel on 9 January 1712, Anne Sharp (<i>bap</i>. 1691), eldest daughter of Archbishop Sharp and his wife, Elizabeth Palmer, whom he had known all her life. Their eldest son, John (1715&#150;1774), became rector of Hilgay, Norfolk, and prebendary and subdean of Ripon; Heneage was born and died in 1718; the third son, also Heneage (1719&#150;1802), was successively vicar of Tadcaster, West Riding, and of Burley on the Hill, Rutland, perpetual curate of Wye, Kent, rector of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and finally prebendary of Canterbury. Two of their five daughters, Elizabeth (1713&#150;1777) and Mary (1721&#150;1798), married, respectively, Charles Elsley of Patrick Brompton, North Riding, and Dr John Sharp, archdeacon of Northumberland. Anne (1716&#150;1780), Philadelphia (1723&#150;1806), and Judith (1730&#150;1813) did not marry.<br>
<br>Dering was conscientious in performing his duties as dean and, though installed by proxy, he came to Ripon a few months later and thereafter resided continually at the deanery with only brief absences on ecclesiastical or family business. Punctilious in his care for the church, he was solicitous in securing the best vicars-choral for the choir and ensuring the welfare of his clergy and parishes. He regularly conducted visitations of his archdeaconry and arranged for confirmations to be held in Ripon in 1723 and 1737. He also ensured that the church registers, which had fallen into some neglect, were properly made up. He made additions to the deanery and alterations to the minster: the font was moved to make room for a new ecclesiastical court (1722), a clock was erected (1723), the surviving fragments of medieval glass from the east window were restored (1724), and the monument to the last wakeman of Ripon, Hugh Ripley (1637), which had been defaced during the civil war, was repaired (1730). He agreed to give Edward Harley, earl of Oxford, a fifteenth-century miscellany manuscript from Dean Anthony Higgin's collection in the minster library and received in exchange a number of valuable printed books.<br>
<br>Dering published two poems in Latin hexameters. The first, <span class="italic">Reliquiae Eboracenses</span> (1743), was a ninety-five page history of Yorkshire under Roman rule, which was originally intended to cover the period of Saxon and Danish rule as well. An English translation in heroic couplets was made by the York printer Thomas Gent &#145;for his private amusement&#146; in the winter of 1760&#150;61 or 1761&#150;2 and survives interleaved in a copy of the Latin text in York Minster Library. Gent proposed to issue his translation in eight or so sheets if he succeeded in attracting a hundred subscribers. The proposal evidently failed but Gent produced a few copies in octavo in 104 pages on his usual coarse paper, without title-page or introduction, but with over fifty crude woodcuts. Dering's other publication was a slender folio entitled <span class="italic">De senectute</span> (1746). While the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span> is a fragment of pseudo-historical epic, ostensibly the later work is purely fanciful and is the lament of one of a pair of oak trees in Studley Royal Park about their approaching doom of being felled. This poem may have been an oblique criticism of the drastic remodelling of the park carried out by the Aislabies.<br>
<br>Dering lived to a great old age and even in 1739, eleven years before his death, he remarked that he was the oldest member of the York chapter and the oldest dean and archdeacon in the northern province. He died at the deanery on 8 April 1750 and on 14 April was buried at the east end of the north choir aisle in Ripon Minster, where a marble wall tablet was placed in his memory. His widow was buried beside him on 19 November 1771.<br>
