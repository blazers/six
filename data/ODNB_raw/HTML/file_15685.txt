<span class="headword">Kirwan,  Owen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, is of unknown origins and family. Sometimes described as a tailor, he was a dealer in secondhand clothes and living at 64 Plunket Street, Dublin, in early 1803 when contacted by the agents of the United Irish leader Robert Emmet. While there is no evidence that Kirwan participated in the rising of 1798, his early initiation into the plot of 1803 strongly indicates that he was none the less a respected United Irishman in the south city. He belonged to the same revolutionary cell as Patrick Street publican Thomas Maguaran and was related to Patrick McCabe, both of whom played significant roles in the rising.<br>
<br>Kirwan worked in an illegal arms depot run by Scottish republican John McIntosh in June and July 1803 at 26 Patrick Street. Hinged pikes, signal rockets, and other munitions were manufactured and concealed behind false partition walls. An explosion of loose powder wrecked the building on 16 July 1803 and killed one of Kirwan's co-workers. This setback persuaded the leadership coterie attached to Emmet to attempt a coup in the capital the following week without awaiting the arrival of their French allies. Upon sighting a rocket in the sky on 23 July Kirwan donned a green jacket presented to him by his wife and led about ten associates to a rallying point on Thomas Street. They were present when skirmishing broke out and Chief Justice Kilwarden was killed. Dismayed by this and other unexpected reverses, Emmet went into hiding in the Dublin mountains leaving the city men under the control of secondary commanders. Kirwan's greatly augmented force returned briefly to his home for refreshments before assisting in the attack on the Coombe barracks of the 21st regiment. The eventual dispersal of the lightly armed rebels brought the abortive rising to a close.<br>
<br>Kirwan was arrested at home on 25 July and tried on 1 September by a special commission convened at Green Street courthouse. Given the quality and quantity of eyewitness testimony against Kirwan, the capital sentence imposed by Judge Baron George on the 2nd was almost inevitable, notwithstanding the characteristically robust defence mounted by John Philpot Curran. Kirwan was executed on Thomas Street on 3 September 1803. He was survived by his wife, about whom nothing further is known.<br>
