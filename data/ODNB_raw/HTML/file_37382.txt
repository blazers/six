<span class="headword">Ealdred <span class="st"> [Aldred]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1069), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, may have come originally from the west country, although little is known of his background. Since his career progressed, both ecclesiastically and politically, in the footsteps of Lyfing, bishop of St Germans, of Crediton, and of Worcester, it is likely that they were kinsmen. If so, Ealdred would also have been related to Brihtwald, bishop of St Germans (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1027).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Like Lyfing, Ealdred began his career as a monk at Winchester and followed Lyfing as abbot of Tavistock in 1027 when the latter was elevated to the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a lifelong interest in Tavistock, where Lyfing was buried, and is named as the previous holder of two estates held by the abbey in 1086. Lyfing had been a great benefactor to Tavistock and it is possible that Ealdred's estates were part of their family holding. By 1044 Ealdred was witnessing royal charters as bishop, probably as suffragan to Lyfing, whom Ealdred succeeded after his death on 23 March 1046. In July 1049 Ealdred, with the men of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, was called upon to repel an invasion force of Irish and Welsh. However, they were taken by surprise in the early hours of 29 July and Ealdred narrowly escaped with his life. In April 1050 he and Bishop Hermann of Ramsbury visited Rome on an errand of Edward the Confessor, most probably to seek dispensation for the removal of the see of Crediton to Exeter; according to later and possibly unreliable sources it was to secure the king's release from a vow of pilgrimage made before his accession. The E version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> says the two bishops were sent to a great synod, probably the Easter Synod which began on 29 April. Returning the same year, Ealdred reconciled Earl Swein Godwinsson with the king and brought him back from Flanders. In 1051 almost the entire Godwine family was exiled and Edward sent Ealdred with troops to intercept Earl Harold Godwinsson as he fled, but, according to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, &#145;they could not or would not&#146;  (text D, s.a. 1052). Undoubtedly, the events of 1051 and Ealdred's known partisanship with the Godwines caused him to be passed over as the successor to &AElig;lfric Puttoc at York in favour of the king's chaplain, Cynesige. However, with the return of the Godwines the following year, it was not long before Ealdred's fortunes were restored. This was aided, perhaps, by his appointing Godric, son of Godman the king's chaplain, to the abbacy of Winchcombe in 1054. Ealdred consecrated Godric on 17 July, having held the abbey himself since the death of Abbot Godwin in 1053. Later in 1054, the king sent him to Germany to arrange the return from Hungary of Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside. He was received with honour by Archbishop Hermann of Cologne and Emperor Henry III and remained there for a year, being presented, among other gifts, with a psalter and sacramentary sent there by Cnut. Ealdred later presented these books to his prior and successor at Worcester, Wulfstan. While he was in Germany, Ealdred gave permission to Bishop Leofwine of Lichfield to consecrate the rebuilt church of Evesham on 10 October in his stead.<br>
<br>On his return in 1055, possibly as a reward for his diplomatic success in Germany, Ealdred was entrusted with the diocese of Ramsbury after Bishop Hermann's resignation and departure from England, until his return in 1058.<br>
<br>On 12 April 1056, Ealdred dedicated a chapel built by Earl Odda at Deerhurst in memory of his brother, &AElig;lfric, who had died three years earlier. Two months later, on 16 June, Leofgar, bishop of Hereford, was killed fighting against the Welsh at the battle of Glasbury-on-Wye and Ealdred was called upon, with the earls Leofric and Harold, to negotiate peace terms with King Gruffudd of north Wales. The successful outcome of these talks resulted in Ealdred being rewarded with the vacant see of Hereford.<h2>
<a name="Travelsabroad"></a>Travels abroad</h2>In 1058 Ealdred consecrated the abbey church of St Peter in Gloucester, which he had rebuilt from its foundations. He maintained his influence over the abbey by installing a kinsman, Wilstan, a monk of Worcester, as abbot and retaining several estates belonging to the abbey under his control. These estates remained under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of York long after Ealdred's death. Following the consecration of St Peter's, Ealdred travelled by way of Hungary to Jerusalem &#145;in such state as none had done before him&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, text D, s.a. 1058). Ealdred's visit to Hungary may have been to arrange for Edward the Exile's family (which included his son Edgar &AElig;theling) to be brought to England, as Edward had died soon after his arrival in England in 1057. While Ealdred was in Jerusalem he gave a gold chalice worth 5 marks to the church of the Holy Sepulchre. He was elected archbishop of York on Christmas day 1060, and gave up the see of Hereford, while intending to hold York and Worcester in plurality like earlier archbishops, including St Oswald. In 1061, accompanied by Earl Tostig Godwinsson, he went to Rome to receive his pallium, but was denied it and deprived of episcopal rank by Pope Nicholas II because his transference from one see to another was against church law. However, he and Earl Tostig were robbed by brigands on their way home and forced to return to Rome, where Nicholas reinstated Ealdred and gave him the pallium, while insisting that he give up Worcester. Papal legates were with Ealdred in England in 1062 to see this implemented, and on 8 September at York he consecrated Wulfstan bishop of Worcester.<h2>
<a name="Crowningmonarchs"></a>Crowning monarchs</h2>Ealdred's known support of the Godwine family suggests that it was he who crowned Harold Godwinsson on 6 January 1066, contrary to the scene portrayed in the Bayeux tapestry. After Harold's death at Hastings, he joined with the earls Eadwine and Morcar in promoting the succession of Edgar &AElig;theling, but on the earls' withdrawal, Ealdred was among the English leaders who submitted to the Normans at Berkhamsted. He accompanied Duke William to London and crowned him king at Westminster on Christmas day 1066; but not, according to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, before he exacted a promise &#145;that he would rule this people as well as any king before him best did&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, text D, s.a. 1066). On 11 May 1068 Ealdred also crowned William's queen, Matilda.<h2>
<a name="Diocesandisputes"></a>Diocesan disputes</h2>The evidence for Ealdred's tenure of Worcester is overshadowed by the later veneration accorded to St Wulfstan. However, three out of the four leases issued by Ealdred survive in the original and he is said to have made several grants of land to the monks. After his elevation to York, it is clear that Ealdred was reluctant to release his hold over Worcester and intended Wulfstan to act as his suffragan. The life of Wulfstan suggests that this desire governed Ealdred's choice of the more malleable Wulfstan as his successor rather than the &#145;worldly&#146; &AElig;thelwig, abbot of Evesham. The life tells that, initially, Ealdred withheld all but seven of Worcester's estates from Wulfstan and that Wulfstan was able to regain all but twelve vills after lengthy negotiation. Indeed, Wulfstan was only able to obtain full control of his dioceses after litigation against Ealdred's successor at York, Thomas of Bayeux. In fact, Thomas, as Ealdred's heir, claimed jurisdiction over the whole diocese of Worcester. There is evidence in <span class="roman">Domesday</span> to suggest that the division of Worcester's lands between the bishop and the cathedral clergy reflects, in part, the original alienation by Ealdred. It was Ealdred, rather than Wulfstan, who took out lawsuits, both before and after 1066, to reclaim Worcester estates from unlawful tenants, and when the building of the castle by the Norman sheriff, Urse d'Abetot, encroached upon the cathedral's cemetery, it was Ealdred who, it is said, uttered the famous words &#145;Hattest thu Urs, have thu Godes kurs&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis pontificum</span>, 253).<br>
<br>For two years Ealdred simultaneously held the dioceses of Worcester, Ramsbury, and Hereford without censure. No sources survive to illustrate his guardianship of Ramsbury. However, while bishop of Hereford, he was able to ensure the protection of the lands of the monks of St &AElig;thelbriht, Hereford, by royal writ.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYork"></a>Archbishop of York</h2>As archbishop of York, Ealdred was active within his archdiocese, building refectories for the communities at York and Southwell, completing the building of a refectory and dormitory begun by his predecessor, and erecting a presbytery at Beverley. The church at Beverley was decorated with paintings and given a bronze, silver, and gold pulpit and crucifix in the German style. Ealdred also commissioned Folcard, a continental monk under his protection, to write a life of St John of Beverley. His building works were part of an attempt to introduce a more regular life to the chapters of these churches, apparently inspired by his observations in Cologne. He also gave lands to them and had those of Beverley protected by royal writs. Folcard recounts &#145;that during the time of Ealdred the church of York shed its former backwardness and, inspired by Ealdred's teaching, grew to handsome maturity&#146;  (Raine, 1.241).<br>
<br>There is also evidence to suggest that Ealdred pursued the claims of his predecessors to jurisdiction over the see of Dorchester and the old diocese of Lindsey. A bull of Pope Nicholas dated 3 May 1061 states that Wulfsige of Dorchester is to hold his see free from the control of the archbishops of York, both past and future. Due to the paucity of northern sources, Ealdred's role in this dispute is shadowy. However, it would appear that he attempted to extend York's interests within Wulfsige's diocese through the purchase of estates, including several from Ulf son of Topi, who appears as a Lincolnshire tenant in <span class="roman">Domesday</span>. Distrust of Ealdred's intentions towards the see of Dorchester may well have influenced the pope's refusal to accept readily Ealdred's candidature for York and it is clear that the bull issued in Wulfsige's favour was made while Ealdred was in Rome. Just as Thomas of Bayeux, at York, laid claim, as Ealdred's heir, to the bishopric of Worcester and his estates in Gloucester, so he was also to be more vociferous in his attempts to acquire control over the see of Dorchester.<h2>
<a name="EaldredandtheAngloSaxonChronicle"></a>Ealdred and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</h2>Much more is known about Ealdred than most Anglo-Saxon churchmen, partly because both the D version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> and the chronicle of John of Worcester were written in his former dioceses not long after his death. He is, in fact, probably the most prominent non-royal individual in the entire D text. The particular interests of this version, in Scotland and the north, with the west midlands until 1061&#150;2 but in the north alone thereafter, parallel Ealdred's career as bishop of Worcester and archbishop of York. The parallel is so close as to suggest that the D text was compiled largely from sources associated closely with Ealdred. It is no surprise, then, that the D text, as well as John of Worcester and Folcard, speaks well of him, and William of Poitiers thought him &#145;wise, good and eloquent&#146;  (Poitiers, <span class="italic">Histoire</span>, 221). The Worcester sources, including the hagiographical life of Wulfstan, have presented a picture of Ealdred as one whose major concerns were not with holy matters but with secular affairs, and as such his reputation is coloured by comparison with Wulfstan, whose canonization was sought as early as 1118.<br>
<br>However, the anonymous chronicle of the archbishops of York tells how Ealdred, influenced by his travels, instigated liturgical reform &#145;which he subsequently caused to be observed in the churches of England&#146;  (Raine, 1.345). He is thought to have been responsible for the introduction of a copy of the <span class="italic">Pontificale Romano-Germanicum</span> into England, on which the composition of the third coronation ordo is based. Ealdred is considered to have composed the ordo, or at the very least instigated its composition, for the coronations of Harold Godwinsson and William I.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>Ealdred was the most widely travelled bishop of the Anglo-Saxon age and appears to have been a skilled diplomat earning the respect of both Anglo-Saxon and Norman contemporaries. There is a York tradition that just before his death he admonished William the Conqueror for the imposition of harsh taxes, contrary to his coronation oath. It is said that the king sent messengers to appease the archbishop but they arrived three days too late. Ealdred died at York on 11 September 1069, and was buried there.<br>
