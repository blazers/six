<span class="headword">Paget,  Thomas</span>, fourth Baron Paget  (<em>c.</em>1544&#150;1590), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic layman and exile</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21121/', "William Paget, first Baron Paget")</script>, the noted Tudor statesman (1505/6&#150;1563), and Anne, Lady Paget (<i>d</i>. 1587), the daughter of Henry Preston. He matriculated as a fellow-commoner of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 27 May 1559, and was admitted to the Middle Temple two years later. He succeeded to the family estates on the death of his elder brother in 1568, and (according to the decision of the House of Lords governing the succession of this title in 1770) succeeded his niece Elizabeth as the fourth holder of the Paget peerage in 1570, accordingly receiving a summons to parliament in 1571. He is mentioned in Ridolfi's memoranda about this time as having Catholic sympathies. Nevertheless, throughout the 1570s he was used by the privy council for various local government purposes in Staffordshire, where he principally resided, partly rebuilding Beaudesert House. He married, about 1570, Nazareth, daughter of Sir John Newton, and widow of Thomas Southwell of Woodrising, Norfolk (whose family was noted for its Catholicism). Their eldest son was the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21122/', "William Paget")</script>.<br>
<br>By 1580 Paget's own religious views seem to have hardened. In July, when the Jesuit Edmund Campion landed in England, Paget arranged for him to preach a sermon to a gathering of London notables. In August he was summoned before the privy council and confined to a house in Windsor for fourteen weeks, where he was instructed in the doctrine of the Church of England by the dean. Early in 1581 he is to be found writing to Walsingham, asking to be excused attendance at St Paul's. The following year the bishop of Lichfield and Coventry wrote to complain of his conduct in providing &#145;singing cakes&#146; rather than bread for use by the parishioners of Burton upon Trent, and of the behaviour of his servants in disrupting Easter Sunday service in Colwich parish church. Paget's life was in turmoil at this point: in 1582 he separated from his wife, telling Burghley that this was &#145;less ill than &hellip; living together with continual jars&#146;. His wife died a year later. When the Throckmorton plot was uncovered in 1583 he fled abroad to join his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21103/', "Charles Paget")</script>, who was in Paris, acting as agent there for Mary, queen of Scots. He presumably feared that his brother's connection with Mary and perhaps other links of his own with the plotters, who came like himself from the midlands, placed his life in England in danger. He wrote to Burghley from France that he had long had it in mind to travel, partly to find a cure for his gout, but also because for the past three years he had been much troubled in conscience.<br>
<br>Paget's time in exile seems to have been a miserable one. The English ambassador in Paris, Stafford, described him a few weeks after his arrival there as &#145;toungue-tied &hellip; cold and patient &hellip; [he] governs himself either wisely or extremely cunningly&#146;. A proclamation was issued in England commanding him to return, and there was a formal&#151;and unsuccessful&#151;request to the French authorities for his extradition. His estates in England were quickly seized by the government and in 1587 he was convicted of treason by the act of attainder which also condemned the Babington plotters. When he arrived on the continent he found himself in the middle of disagreements between the exiled English, with his brother in one camp and the leading Catholic exile clergymen, Robert Persons and William Allen, in another. He travelled from Paris to Milan and then to Rome, where he stayed in the spring of 1585 at the English College, along with his two servants. He was rather coolly received there, on account of the strength in Rome of the faction opposed to his brother. He then went to Spain where Philip II gave him a pension of 180 crowns a month. He next moved to the Spanish Netherlands in the hope of being restored by the Armada, and was consulted by Parma over the invasion plans. It was at Brussels that he died, some time in 1590.<br>
