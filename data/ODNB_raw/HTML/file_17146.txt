<span class="headword">Luckombe,  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1730, <em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">printer and writer</span>, was born in Exeter and baptized in the church of St Lawrence, Exeter, on 8 November 1730, son of John Luckombe, tailor. His brother John was baptized on 17 November 1728 in the same church. Philip, a printer by trade, was made a freeman of Exeter by succession in 1776, probably in order to vote in the general election of 1776. A report that he entered one of the Oxford colleges  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>) seems highly doubtful and is not corroborated by any university register. Luckombe did leave Exeter but settled in London, from where he did much miscellaneous literary work; in 1803 he was resident in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West in the City. Besides editing several dictionaries and encyclopaedias, he wrote books on printing and made a special study of conchology. His collection of shells was large, and his learning brought him into contact with Thomas Percy, bishop of Dromore and author of the famous collection of ballads <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span>.<br>
<br>Of Luckombe's several works, perhaps the liveliest was <span class="italic">A Tour through Ireland in Several Entertaining Letters</span> (1748), which he co-wrote with William Rufus Chetwood. Chetwood knew Ireland well through his links with the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. The letters are addressed to &#145;Ned&#146;, that is &#145;E. H. esq&#146;, in his chambers in the Middle Temple. There are several lively incidents, from the party's being surrounded by straw plaiters and having to buy a woman's hat to make their escape, to stories of grizzly murders, and hanged men brought back to life, all recalled with relish and showing Chetwood's sense of the dramatic. This <span class="italic">Tour</span> seems to have relied at least in part on firsthand information, though antiquarian details are culled from elsewhere. Luckombe's <span class="italic">Tour through Ireland</span> of 1780 is more extensively plagiarized from others, including Richard Twiss, though Luckombe was in Ireland in 1779. Luckombe also wrote guides to England and Wales.<br>
<br>Luckombe published anonymously in 1770 <span class="italic">A Concise History of the Origin and Progress of Printing</span> and the following year published a second edition under the title <span class="italic">The History and Art of Printing</span> (2 parts) which went out over his name. The work was based on his own firsthand experience of the printing trade, and the technical information it provides led to its being reprinted in 1965.<br>
<br>Luckombe died in September 1803. He seems to have been unmarried, as his will (January 1803) mentions only male friends and his brother, John Luckombe of Exeter, his executor and the main beneficiary of his will.<br>
