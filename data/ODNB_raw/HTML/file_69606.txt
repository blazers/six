<span class="headword">Selvon,  Samuel Dickson <span class="st"> [Sam]</span></span>  (1923&#150;1994), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 20 May 1923 at 42&#150;44 Mount Moriah Road, San Fernando, Trinidad, West Indies, the sixth of seven children of Bertwyn Fraser Selvon (1889&#150;1951), cocoa merchant, and his wife, Daisy Irene Dickson (<i>c</i>.1887&#150;1951). Bertwyn was of Madrasi Indian stock. Daisy Irene was of mixed race, the fourth of six children born to a Scotsman, George Van Buren Dickson, and Keasoo (later Laura), a woman of Indian origin. Selvon spent his childhood in a middle-class family home at 42&#150;44 Mount Moriah Road in San Fernando close to the canelands (worked by descendants of Indians) and oilfields (worked by descendants of Africans), the two mainstays of the island's economy. His early schooling was at Miss Douglin's primary school, in Mount Moriah Road, and at the Vistabella Canadian Mission primary school, San Fernando. He completed his primary education at the San Fernando Canadian Mission school in 1937 and entered Naparima College, where he wrote impressive English compositions, but left in 1938, without taking the school certificate examination. In 1939 he enlisted in the Trinidad Royal Naval Reserve and became a wireless operator.<br>
<br>From 1945 to 1950 Selvon worked in Port of Spain and lived on its outskirts in Barataria. He edited the <span class="italic">Sunday Guardian</span>'s literary magazine, and wrote regular columns of a social and philosophical nature in the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> under the pseudonyms Ack-Ack, Denmar Cosel, Michael Wentworth, Esses, and the Big Buffer. Similar material appeared in the near-autobiographical <span class="italic">An Island is a World</span> (1955) and the collection <span class="italic">Foreday Morning: Selected Prose, 1946&#150;1986</span> (1989).<br>
<br>The tall, handsome, light-skinned young man married Draupadi Persaud (1915&#150;1972) from Essequibo, British Guiana, on 2 August 1947 at Susumachar Presbyterian Church in San Fernando. They lived in Barataria up to 1950 when Selvon led the post-war movement of West Indian writers that made London the West Indian literary capital for most of the fifties, sixties, and seventies. Draupadi joined him in London in 1951 and their only child, Shelley Sarojini, was born there on 4 February 1952. The couple divorced in 1962.<br>
<br>On 6 January 1963 Selvon married a Eurasian woman, Althea Nesta Daroux (born in Bhopal, India, in 1931), prototype of the girl immortalized in one of his finest short stories, &#145;My Girl and the City&#146; and the family's breadwinner for many years. They had three children: Michael Dickson, Leslie Gordon, and Debra Jane. On 14 March 1978, after twenty-eight years in England, Selvon migrated to Canada, where his wife had relatives. The family settled in Calgary, Alberta. Selvon was held in high regard by those interested in West Indian literature and he still had many friends in Britain, but a growing dissatisfaction with life in the mother country prompted him to leave, never to return.<br>
<br>Selvon's familiarity with people of all classes and ethnicities fostered his notion of the Trinidadian person as &#145;a creature born of all the peoples in the world&#146;  (Selvon, <span class="italic">An Island is a World</span>, 1955, 257): all ethnic groups are projected in his writings and they are seen primarily as people in the complex process of becoming creole or &#145;of the island&#146;. Some of his stories, however, notably &#145;Cane is Bitter&#146; and the novels <span class="italic">A Brighter Sun</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Turn Again Tiger</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">The Plains of Caroni</span> (1972), give face and voice to Indians who form half the population of Trinidad but were regarded until recently as a minority needing to prove their allegiance to Trinidad. Outstanding among these works is <span class="italic">A Brighter Sun</span>, set during the war years and introducing Tiger, a peasant at war with himself as he seeks knowledge, experience, and identity. The novel also addresses the political issue of African&#150;Indian relations.<br>
<br>The travails and the ebullient spirit of the first wave of West Indian migrants to London are depicted with humour and pathos in <span class="italic">The Housing Lark</span> (1965), in some of the stories in <span class="italic">Ways of Sunlight</span> (1957), and in Selvon's most celebrated novel, <span class="italic">The Lonely Londoners</span> (1956), which is the first of three books with a central character called Moses. In these works he used dialect for both narration and dialogue; and narrative structure and tone openly proclaim the symbiotic relationship between popular and literary, folktale and fiction, oral and scribal, that makes Selvon an original, the country's calypsonian in prose.<br>
<br>Although Selvon wrote poems and plays, it was his short stories and novels that restored a sense of self-worth to the descendants of enslaved Africans and indentured Indians, reflecting them in fiction as main characters and full human beings. He released dialect from its stereotyping as comic or pathetic, and united West Indian writing and orality, enabling writing to own up to the West Indian tone of voice and thus shake off its imitative character. The popular creator of characters like Tiger and Moses was generous but never far from poverty, was outwardly happy-go-lucky but often morose and introspective.<br>
<br>Selvon held a fellowship in creative writing at Dundee University in 1975&#150;7; he became the first writer-in-residence at the University of the West Indies in 1982; and he took up writer-in-residence appointments at the universities of Victoria, Winnipeg, Alberta, and Calgary, where incidentally he had worked for a while as a janitor on first arriving in Canada. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Warwick University (1989). He was also awarded the honorary degree of DLitt by the University of the West Indies in 1985 and, for achievement in literature, the country bestowed upon him two of its highest awards in 1969 and 1994.<br>
<br>A lifelong smoker not averse to the bottle, Selvon returned to Trinidad in late 1993. He died of respiratory failure due to extensive bronchopneumonia and chronic lung disease on 16 April 1994 at Piarco international airport, Trinidad. After cremation at St James crematorium, Trinidad, on 19 April his ashes were interred in the University of the West Indies cemetery, St Augustine, Trinidad.<br>
