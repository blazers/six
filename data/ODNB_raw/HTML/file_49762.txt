<span class="headword">Halstead <span class="st"> [Tarlo]</span>,  (Lambert) Beverly</span>  (1933&#150;1991), <span class="occ">palaeontologist</span>, was born in Pendleton, Lancashire, on 13 June 1933, the son of Lambert Halstead (1907&#150;1983), painter and decorator, and his wife, Elizabeth (Betty), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Waring (1911&#150;1991), railway clerk. He was brought up in circumstances of social isolation. His mother was the dominant parent; she believed in treating children without overt affection and as young adults. Moreover, she was an atheist and practising communist, at a time when such views were anathema to Lancashire country folk. His father was a talented artist and a much gentler person, without such strong views. When, during the Second World War, Betty met Maurice Tarlo, a young solicitor who shared her ideals, she abandoned her husband and moved south to Eastbourne, Sussex, to live with him, soon marrying him and insisting that her son adopt the surname Tarlo. Halstead's upbringing was thus harsh, forcing him to be independent and a loner. However, he did gain from his mother a capacity for intellectual exploration and the courage to endure unpopularity when standing up for his beliefs. This did not endear him to the headmaster of Lewes grammar school; the report on him was so adverse that he had trouble in finding a university place. However, its virulence intrigued Professor Leslie Moore of the University of Sheffield, where Halstead was admitted as an honours student in geology&#151;fortunately, since Halstead's interest was in palaeontology, a discipline in which (exceptionally at that time) Sheffield excelled. Upon finding plesiosaur bones during a field excursion on the Yorkshire coast, Halstead determined to specialize on fossil vertebrates. A fellow student, John R. L. Allen, became his close friend; they were soon undertaking joint researches on the Old Red Sandstone strata of the Welsh borderland. By that time Halstead was not only a prominent member of the student Communist Society, but also contributing notes on rocks and fossils to the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>. His political sympathies facilitated a visit in 1955 to Poland, during which he contrived to visit classic Devonian fish localities, making discoveries that culminated in two massive monographs published in <span class="italic">Palaeontologica Polonica</span> in 1964 and 1965. However, he was not impressed by Poland's social climate&#151;a first stirring of the doubts that caused him to abandon the Communist Party, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956.<br>
<br>Upon gaining his honours degree Halstead moved to London, to study Jurassic pliosaurs at University College. He elected to present, for his doctorate, a group of published papers instead of a thesis&#151;a permissible alternative, but unpopular with his departmental superiors; their hostility delayed until 1959 the award of his PhD but before then Halstead had gained a three-year research fellowship at the British Museum (Natural History) and resumed research on Palaeozoic fishes. His studies of fossil teeth next earned him a Nuffield research fellowship, enabling researches at the Royal Dental Hospital and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford. A series of important papers on Palaeozoic fishes and their dentition culminated in two books, <span class="italic">The Pattern of Vertebrate Evolution</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">Vertebrate Hard Tissues</span> (1974).<br>
<br>Halstead's early papers were published under the name L. B. Tarlo, but he had never become close to his stepfather. By 1965 he was styling himself L. B. Halstead Tarlo and by 1968, he had reassumed his born name, L. B. Halstead. He had also, on 27 November 1957, married a dentistry student, Beryl Joan Morris (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), daughter of Rex Alfred Shalson, musician, and a divorcee with two daughters from her earlier marriage. In 1963 they moved to Reading University where Halstead had gained a joint appointment in the departments of geology and zoology&#151;a congenial move, since John Allen was already there. Halstead proved an excellent and inspiring teacher, beloved by his students and very supportive of them. These were years of high scientific productivity, with visits to Estonia and Russia to study fossil fishes (1961) and writings on such diverse topics as Triassic reptiles and protomammals, a supposed Eocene whale, and amino-acids in Oligocene tortoiseshell. His personal life proved less satisfactory. After some years of increasing marital strife he and Beryl separated, but the divorce proved long and costly; it was not achieved until 1975.<br>
<br>Halstead's restlessness caused him to travel to Nigeria in 1967 at the time of its civil war. Undeterred by an episode of arrest and interrogation, he conceived a liking for its people. He went also to Tunisia (1968) and then to Rhodesia and South Africa (1969), where his defiance of racial prejudices brought both admiration and problems. Desiring to develop co-operative researches between Reading and the University of the Witwatersrand, he returned again to South Africa in 1970, but was instantly expelled as a political subversive. Predictably, this made him a hero among black Africans. A second, brief visit to Nigeria (1970) was the prelude to a three-year appointment as head of zoology at the University of Ife (1971&#150;4), during which he also spent three months at the Punjab University, Chandigarh, India. At both universities he strove to develop low-budget research projects&#151;in Nigeria on the ecology of lizards and fruit-bats and, in India, on the geology of the Siwalik Hills. An expedition into the Sokoto region, north-western Nigeria, brought the discovery of a new fossil crocodile (<i>Sokotosuchus</i>).<br>
<br>Halstead had met in 1970 a talented medical illustrator, Jennifer Anne (Jenny) Middleton (<i>b</i>. 1941/2), daughter of Wilfred Middleton, a surveyor. They collaborated on a book on the functional and artistic significance and folklore of bones, <span class="italic">Bare Bones</span> (1972) and, when she joined him at Ile-Ife, on a series of dissection guides for students. They were married on 23 May 1975, after Halstead's return to Reading: their son and only child, Thomas Atlay James, was born on 2 September 1980. Endeavouring to alleviate the straitened circumstances resulting from divorce and remarriage, Halstead began to write books on palaeontology for a general audience, often illustrated by Jenny. They included <span class="italic">The Evolution and Ecology of the Dinosaurs</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Fossil Hunting</span> (1977), <span class="italic">The Evolution of the Mammals</span> (1978), <span class="italic">Hunting the Past</span> (1982), and four fictionalized biographies of extinct creatures for children. He also contributed to a number of compilative volumes, such as <span class="italic">Elsevier's Animal Encyclopaedia</span> (1972) and Hallam's <span class="italic">Atlas of Palaeobiogeography</span> (1973).<br>
<br>Eager for further discoveries, Halstead conducted an international palaeontological expedition to Nigeria in mid-December 1977 with fourteen members (including his wife). Upon arrival in Sokoto, however, they were arrested by the military governor and sent in custody to Lagos. Though soon released and permitted to proceed, the expedition fell apart. Not until late January 1978 did its residual three members&#151;Halstead, Jenny, and Cyril Walker&#151;return to Sokoto where, with belated official assistance, significant discoveries of fossil turtles were made. A journey to China in 1979 resulted not only in the discovery of a new group of Palaeozoic fishes (galeaspids), but also of mineral replicas of their internal anatomy. In 1983, against Jenny's advice, Halstead went again to Nigeria, on official invitation. All went well until he was leaving but then, between air terminal and plane, he was arrested by the security police and sent to prison in Lagos. Though he was released after a week it was a frightening ordeal which aged him considerably. His appearance&#151;slim and intense, with black hair and fiery eyes&#151;had always been mephistophelean; henceforward, with hair prematurely white and lessened energy, he seemed more like an elder satanic statesman.<br>
<br>Yet Halstead's concerns did not diminish; rather, they diversified. He became an increasingly vocal opponent of creationism, engaging in a much-publicized debate with the creationist Duane Gish and writing many critical articles. A visit to Japan in 1984 caused him to challenge the equally erroneous concepts of Kinji Imanishi, in a book published only in Japanese (1988). He opposed the concept of a catastrophic cause for dinosaur extinction and castigated Fred Hoyle's idea that life on earth had an extraterrestrial origin. He was also a participant, always outspoken and courageous, in many other controversies: the efficacy of underground nuclear testing; cladistics as a means for determining evolutionary relationships; the administrative and scientific structure of the Natural History Museum; the concept of &#145;test-tube&#146; nuclear fusion; the Piltdown hoax; the dangers of AIDS; and, more lightheartedly, the reality of the Loch Ness monster.<br>
<br>Other professional activities continued apace. Halstead was editor for seven years of the <span class="italic">Nigerian Field</span>, co-editor of <span class="italic">Palaeontology</span> for five years, and a highly innovative editor of <span class="italic">Modern Geology</span> from 1983 until his death. He addressed many national and international meetings and was a proud member of London's Athenaeum. His enthusiasm for informing the public at large about geology made him a vigorous and enterprising member of the Geologists' Association and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. At one of its meetings, in 1985, he encountered a psychologist from the University of Bath, Helen Haste; he travelled with her to Canada and the United States in 1987 and shared his latter years with her, although he never completely severed his relationship with his wife, Jenny, and son, Tom. The physical stresses of that North American visit perhaps hastened the onset of cancer of the bladder, shortly after their return to England. Though Halstead's recovery was slow, he was soon involved in fresh controversies. His vigorous advocacy of the abandonment of thesis-writing as a PhD qualification and of the Thatcher government's plans for &#145;rationalizing&#146; geology departments outraged his Reading colleagues. There was also a confrontation with that university's vice-chancellor, whose actions Halstead had criticized; his formal apology was manifestly insincere. Consequently, when the teaching function of Reading's geology department was eliminated, Halstead lost his academic base. Thereafter, he commuted between Reading, Bath, and London, where he had gained an honorary research position at Imperial College, writing articles on the train.<br>
<br>Halstead's career should have attained its apogee in 1991. He was president of the Geologists' Association and president-elect of section C (geology) of the British Association. He was to be a principal speaker at a special session at the Plymouth meeting, to commemorate the sesquicentennial of Richard Owen's first recognition of the dinosaurs. Instead, driving to Bath on the evening of 30 April 1991, he died in a motor accident caused by the error of a lorry driver.<br>
<br>Halstead's researches transformed understanding of Palaeozoic fishes and of the environment of the earliest vertebrates. His popular writings and lectures on palaeontology and evolution brought scientific enlightenment to many, while his willingness to challenge dogmas stimulated thought among students and public alike. His published bibliography lists 414 publications. The many tributes paid to him at his funeral on 9 May 1991 showed how he had surmounted all the controversies and become widely beloved.<br>
