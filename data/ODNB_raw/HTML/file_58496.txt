<span class="headword">Scotson,  James</span>  (1836&#150;1911), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born in Manchester, the son of Robert Scotson, a working man. From the age of seven he attended the New Jerusalem School, Peter Street, Manchester (founded for boys in 1827 and opened for girls in 1844). He was apprenticed as a pupil teacher at the school, then attracting some 600 pupils, in 1849 and appointed assistant master from 1854. Having been awarded a first-class teacher's certificate, he was appointed headmaster with effect from 1 January 1858. On 14 August 1857 he married Betsey (<i>b</i>. 1836/7), daughter of John Taylor, at the New Jerusalem Church, Bolton Street, Salford.<br>
<br>From 1862, under payment by results, reading, writing, and arithmetic were examined in six standards, but Scotson extended the curriculum and began to develop a specialist school for older pupils. In 1880 Peter Street was merged with the Lower Mosley Street British School as the Central School under the Manchester school board and consolidated into one of the first higher grade schools for pupils who had passed standards I&#150;IV and wished to prolong their education. Scotson was appointed headmaster.<br>
<br>In 1884 the royal commission on technical education, chaired by Bernhard Samuelson, recorded the emergence of higher grade schools where additional subjects were taught more satisfactorily than in schools containing children of all ages and all stages of progress. Scotson's school was described as remarkable  (Samuelson commission second report, 1.425). There were 320 boys and 200 girls taking mathematics, science, physical geography, and French. On 7 July 1884 a four-storey building, complete with two laboratories and a machine-drawing room, was opened in Deansgate by A. J. Mundella, the minister responsible for education. Bringing together picked intellects in higher schools from great towns and cities, he said, would stimulate all the elementary schools below them  (<span class="italic">School Board Chronicle</span>, 41).<br>
<br>In December 1886 Scotson gave evidence to the Cross commission and urged that schools similar to his own should be set up in every town of from 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants. In his view their purpose was either to form a connecting link between the ordinary elementary school and existing secondary schools, or where the latter were either inferior or did not exist at all, to take their place. Pupils could stay until they were sixteen; fees were 9<i>d</i>. per week. There were now 208 boys and 129 girls in standard VI, 215 boys and 103 girls in the new standard VII; also retained in the school were 300 boys and 50 girls who had passed standard VII who were assembled in a so-called organized science school under the auspices of the Department of Science and Art (South Kensington), which granted the school 10<i>s</i>. a year for every pupil who attended 250 times and passed its science examination. These pupils were also taught French, arithmetic, and composition; their day began with an hour's religious instruction. Twenty-five per cent of the boys left to go into engineering, chemical laboratories or architecture. Two-thirds of recent girl leavers went into teaching. By 1891 Scotson had 1400 pupils: 1000 boys and 400 girls. His staff consisted of sixteen masters and assistants; the headmistress had a staff of six and there were special teachers for science, engineering, French, German, and cookery. Two former pupils, one male, one female, had recently been awarded a BSc from Victoria University of Manchester; another had gained a double first at Oxford.<br>
<br>Though he was on the executive of the National Union of Elementary Teachers in the 1870s Scotson of Manchester, as he was known  (Christian, 48), preferred not to rise further, but when twenty headmasters of higher grade and organized science schools met in Manchester on 5 November 1892 and set up an association he was elected first annual president. Two years later, answering a circular letter from the Bryce commission addressed to some twenty distinguished educationists, Scotson outlined his plans for connecting higher grade schools' boys' departments with grammar or secondary schools. Higher grade schools would have a lower part, into which former elementary pupils could enter having passed standard IV. If a boy wished to prepare for a profession he would complete standard V, then be prepared for the classical department of a secondary school. The majority would progress into the organized science school, most for a two-year course in science, mathematics, and modern languages, a few for three or four years to compete for national or county scholarships. The Bryce report, however, favoured a system in which the higher grade school would be an institution made distinct from grammar or secondary schools by the intended leaving age of its scholars. In 1897 a joint memorandum drawn up by the Association of Headmasters (representing the grammar schools) and the Association of Higher Grade Schools agreed this principle which was incorporated in the Board of Education's higher school minute of April 1900. Higher grade schools' function as a conduit by which able elementary school pupils could pass upwards without encountering a selective bar had ended: a few, including the Central School, were awarded secondary status.<br>
<br>Scotson, who had been awarded an MSc in 1902 by the Victoria University of Manchester, <i>honoris causa</i>, remained in charge of his school until the change took place. He retired in July 1904. Bearded, tall, and well built, with a thunderous voice, he was a genial man of powerful intellect, forcible yet sympathetic. In 1884 Mundella had provided him with a famous epitaph: &#145;When I want to point to some first-rate schoolmasters in England I generally begin with Mr Scotson. Mr Scotson I consider the prince of our elementary schoolmasters&#146;  (<span class="italic">School Board Chronicle</span>, 41). Scotson died at his home, 19 Wellington Road, Whalley Range, Manchester, on 4 June 1911. His remains were cremated two days later at Manchester crematorium.<br>
