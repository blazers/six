<span class="headword">Bogan,  Zachary</span>  (1625&#150;1659), <span class="occ">classical and biblical scholar</span>, was born about 24 June 1625 at Gatcombe House, Little Hempston, Devon, the third son of William Bogan (<i>bap</i>. 1582, <i>d</i>. 1658), gentleman, and his wife, Joane Irish, daughter of Zachary Irish. His paternal grandmother was Prothesia (Prothesy) Bodley, sister of Sir Thomas Bodley; the Bogans were originally merchants from Totnes. Having been &#145;excellently grounded in Grammar, and the Classick Authors&#146; by an eminent local schoolmaster, Mr Batten  (Prince, 118), Bogan became a commoner of St Alban Hall, Oxford, in Michaelmas term 1640, matriculating on 13 November, and was tutored by the puritan Ralph Button. On 26 November 1641 he entered Corpus Christi College as a scholar but a year later, the city having become a royalist garrison, he retired to his parents' home. After parliament captured Oxford in 1646 he returned and graduated BA on 21 October. He was elected a probationary fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1647.<br>
<br>When summoned by the parliamentary visitors on 9 May 1648, most college members objected on legal grounds. Bogan answered, &#145;When I shal be satisfied in conscience that I may lawfully doe it, I will readily submitt&#146;, and was listed for expulsion with the rest  (Burrows, 62). He escaped on account of illness: James Metford, one of those expelled, recalled that Bogan was &#145;consumptive and his death daily expected&#146;; the visitors left him &#145;by their Charity&#146; as one whom &#145;twas plain inhumanity to drive out&#146;  (Fowler, 217). He was formally readmitted as a fellow on 2 November 1648, and is named in the visitors' register for 1649 and 1651. He became MA on 19 November 1650. Wood described him as &#145;a retired and religious Student, and much noted in the University for his admirable skill in the Tongues&#146;; he mentioned him with Edward Pococke for excellence in Hebrew and the oriental languages  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.237, 160). Bogan was an outstanding tutor, whose students included Daniel Agas, to whom he left his library, and the antiquary William Fulman. After years of ill health, he died on 1 September 1659 at Corpus Christi College and was buried to the south of the college chapel. He had inherited &pound;1500 from his father, and in his will, dated 1 August 1659, he left most of it to his elder brother William. He bequeathed &pound;500 to sponsor apprenticeships in five Oxford parishes, in appreciation of which his portrait, &#145;drawn more to the Death, than to the Life (so wan and pale it looks)&#146;  (Prince, 121), hangs in the city council chamber.<br>
<br>Bogan greatly enlarged Francis Rous's <span class="italic">Archaeologia Attica</span>, a popular companion to Greek studies. His additions (published in 1649 and acknowledged by Bogan in 1654) deal with &#145;customes in Marriages, Burialls, Feastings, Divinations &amp;c.&#146; A postscript apologizes for this product of &#145;my <i>Tyrocinium</i>&#146; (first attempt) written &#145;to divert my humor of Melancholy&#146; but impeded by illness and want of time. In 1652 he recalls being &#145;in a manner buried alive in melancholy&#146;, for months unable to read and for years to remember what he had read. That is in the dedication &#145;To my honoured father&#146;  (sig. *3<i>r</i>) of <span class="italic">A View of the Threats and Punishments Recorded in the Scriptures, Alphabetically Composed</span> (1653), drafted with surprising energy &#145;in very little more than a fortnight's time&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>). Bogan had already written <span class="italic">Meditations of the Mirth of a Christian Life</span> (1653): not his own experience (&#145;whole yeares altogether in <i>Sadnesse</i>&#146;) but what &#145;other Christians better than I am, <i>may</i> have&#146;, and definitely not &#145;<i>carnall merriment</i>&#146;, which he would have castigated at greater length but for &#145;a troublesome, and dangerous sicknesse&#146; (&#145;To my honoured mother&#146;; sig. &para;2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). In 1655 Bogan contributed to Edmund Dickinson's <span class="italic">Delphi Phoenicizantes</span>, a Latin dissertation that connects the giants in <span class="roman">Job</span> 26: 5 with Hesiod's Typhon. This line of speculation led to his <span class="italic">Homerus <i>Hebraiz&#333;n</i>, sive, Comparatio Homeri cum scriptoribus sacris quoad normam loquendi</span> (1658). Structured as a commentary on Homer, this substantial Latin discourse accumulated comparable expressions from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and also the <span class="roman">New</span>. Bogan wrote it for pleasure when illness forced him to discontinue a treatise on Greek particles. He never finished that book, or another on the use of the poets. His last publication was posthumous, edited by Daniel Agas: <span class="italic">A Help to Prayer, both Extempore, and by a Set Forme</span> (1660). This was another collection of scriptural texts similar to <span class="italic">Threats and Punishments</span>, unpublishable when written in 1651 on account of its impressively open-minded preface in which Bogan compared the old forms of his childhood worship with the extempore prayer that he now found more affecting.<br>
