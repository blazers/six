<span class="headword">Smith,  Benjamin Leigh</span>  (1828&#150;1913), <span class="occ">Arctic explorer</span>, was born in Whatlington, Sussex, on 12 March 1828, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25779/', "Benjamin Smith (1783&#150;1860)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25931/', "Smith, William (1756&#150;1835)")</script>], MP for Norwich, and Anne Longden (1801&#150;1834), a milliner. His sister was the artist and women's activist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2755/', "Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon")</script>, a co-founder of Girton College, Cambridge. His paternal grandfather was the politician William Smith. The family was wealthy and radical in its views. His parents were unmarried, his father believing that the marriage laws were unjust to women; but because the children were illegitimate many of their relatives refused to associate with them. After the death of his mother from tuberculosis in 1834, Benjamin was brought up by his father first at Pelham Crescent, Hastings, and then at his London home, 5 Blandford Square. Educated first at home by progressive tutors and then at the Unitarian Bruce Castle School, in 1848 Smith was elected a pensioner of Jesus College, Cambridge; he was senior wrangler in 1852. As a nonconformist he was not granted the BA degree until 1857, when he was the first dissenter to be admitted. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1856.<br>
<br>Smith travelled widely in his youth. He took the Board of Trade licence to command his own ships and, probably inspired by James Lamont, from 1871 to 1882 he sailed in Arctic waters. In 1871 he took the yacht <i>Sampson</i> to Spitsbergen and to the Seven Islands, reaching lat. 81&deg;30' N. In 1872 he could not get beyond the north-west capes of Spitsbergen. His interest was always scientific and not merely that of a hunter or traveller. He had invented an instrument for computing time at sea and, with Captain J. C. Wells, did valuable oceanographic work on the Gulf Stream during his two voyages. On his 1873 voyage he met A. E. Nordenski&ouml;ld, the Swedish explorer and scientist, but bad weather forced him home. In 1878 he tried vainly to reach Spitsbergen but it was a close season.<br>
<br>In 1880 Smith built the screw brigantine <i>Eira</i> in which he sailed from Peterhead, but because of mist and pack ice failed to make Jan Mayen or east Greenland. Learning that ice on the north coast of Spitsbergen made it impossible to pass Amsterdam Island, he made for Franz Josef Land, recently discovered (in 1873&#150;4) and only partly mapped. He reached and named May Island in August, adding the south-west coast of the new land to the chart. He also made some additions to the chart of the east coast of Spitsbergen. For these discoveries he was awarded the patron's medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1881. His paper on the voyage of 1880 was read at a meeting of the society and its importance agreed.<br>
<br>In 1881 the <i>Eira</i> sailed from Peterhead and sighted Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land, but on 21 August the yacht was nipped between pack ice and land floe off Cape Flora, and sank within two hours. The crew lived in a makeshift hut, built from materials they had previously deposited on Bell Island, for ten months, before taking to their boats in June 1882 for the homeward passage. They reached Novaya Zemlya where they met the <i>Hope</i>, commanded by Sir Allen W. Young, who had been sent to find them following considerable speculation in England as to their whereabouts. The whole crew landed safely at Aberdeen at the end of August 1882, having survived the winter because lack of provisions led them to live on a much healthier diet of fresh meat, and because of Smith's quiet leadership.<br>
<br>Back in England, Smith gave &pound;1000 to the Royal Geographical Society in gratitude for the mounting of the search party. In 1882 he was made an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. He made no further Arctic expeditions, and revoked the bequest of &pound;80,000 he had left to the Royal Geographical Society in 1887, in frustration at their neglect of polar exploration. None the less, in 1892 he worked with the society to promote scientific investigation of the Antarctic.<br>
<br>In 1882 Smith married Charlotte Annette (<i>b</i>. 1862/3), daughter of Frederick William Seller, wine merchant of Paddington. They had two sons and two daughters, and lived quietly at Scalands, near Robertsbridge, Sussex. He died on 4 January 1913 at 43 Frognal, Hampstead, and was buried in Brightling, Sussex.<br>
