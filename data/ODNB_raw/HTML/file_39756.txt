<span class="headword">Angel,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1673), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, first came to public notice in winter 1659&#150;60, when he joined the troupe assembled by John Rhodes at the Cockpit in Drury Lane. Angel's earliest recorded appearance was as Florimel in Fletcher and Rowley's <span class="italic">The Maid in the Mill</span>, a part which required the young actor to dress as a woman. Following Charles II's return to England, Angel joined the Duke's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields. In November 1662 he appeared before the king, playing the part of Pyropus in Ferdinando Parkhurst's translation of George Ruggle's Latin comedy <span class="italic">Ignoramus, or, The Academical Lawyer</span>. During the next few seasons Angel took on a variety of parts, including serious dramatic roles such as Warwick in the earl of Orrery's <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (1664) and Viche in Orrery's <span class="italic">Mustapha</span> (1665). However, it soon became apparent that Angel's particular talent lay in scenes of low comedy and farce. In November 1667 he played Stephano in Dryden and Davenant's adaptation of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, a role which he reprised throughout the season. In February 1668 he again appeared before King Charles, this time taking the lead comic part in a revival of Thomas Tomkis's <span class="italic">Albumazar</span>. The role of the country farmer Trincalo, whose imitation of the airs of a city gentleman results in a series of farcical episodes, proved a perfect vehicle for Angel's talent as a mimic and a clown. The actor's success in <span class="italic">Albumazar</span> was noted by Samuel Pepys, who recorded that &#145;The King here, and, indeed, all of us, [were] pretty merry at the mimique tricks of Trinkilo&#146;  (Pepys, 9.85&#150;6).<br>
<br>As a member of the Duke's Company, Angel often appeared onstage alongside James Nokes, an actor with a similar gift for low comedy. In an attempt to rival the physical humour of the French and Italian comedians popular at court, Angel and Nokes took to the stage in a series of outlandish costumes. In the central comic scene of Orrery's <span class="italic">Mr Anthony</span> (1669) the two comedians acted out a mock battle, Angel wielding &#145;two Crab-tree Cudgels with Basket-hilts&#146;, Nokes carrying a bow and arrow  (<span class="italic">Dramatic Works</span>, 2.542&#150;5). Several of Angel's contemporaries regretted the actor's success in such roles as furthering the trend towards visual and slapstick humour in Restoration comedy. In the prologue to the first part of <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span> (performed 1670) John Dryden describes Nokes and Angel as &#145;the best Comedians of the Age&#146;. However, he protests at the tendency of the two actors to debase the productions in which they appear, observing that &#145;A broad-brim'd hat, and wastbelt&#146; are no substitute for true comic wit  (<span class="italic">Works of John Dryden</span>, 11.19). The playwright Edward Howard likewise saw Angel's love of physical humour and ridiculous costume as symptomatic of declining dramatic standards. In the prologue to Howard's <span class="italic">The Womens Conquest</span> (1671), Angel, Nokes, and another leading comic actor, Cave Underhill, appear together on stage, where they plot to replace the subsequent play with an extended farce. Angel boasts that the entertainment he has devised contains &#145;sixteen Mimicks in it, several Jack-Puddings, and Punchinellos, never presented before, with two and thirty Dances and Jiggs a-la-mode besides&#146;. Before they can usurp Howard's play, however, the conspirators are scared away by the ghost of Ben Jonson, which rises from the grave to reassert the rules of true comedy  (Howard, sigs. c2<i>v</i>&#150;c4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>The reservations expressed by Dryden and Howard as to the puerility of Angel's brand of low comedy were shared by Aphra Behn. In her prologue to <span class="italic">The Amorous Prince</span> (1671), Behn castigates those:<blockquote>
<div>Who swear they'd rather hear a smutty jest<br>
</div>
<div>Spoken by <i>Nokes</i> or <i>Angel</i>, than a Scene<br>
</div>
<div>Of the admir'd and well-penn'd <i>Cataline</i>.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Works of Aphra Behn</span>, 5.87)</blockquote>Despite such reservations, Angel's talent for exaggerated mimicry and physical humour continued to attract London audiences. Within a few months of his attack upon the &#145;Mimikry and other ridiculous Gestures&#146; favoured by Angel  (Howard, sig. b3<i>v</i>), Howard sought to accommodate the actor's talent for farcical humour in his new play, <span class="italic">The Six Days Adventure</span> (1671). Here Angel took the role of Peacock, a preening buffoon who appears onstage in a gaudy suit of parrot and parakeet feathers. The following spring Angel again appeared alongside Nokes, this time as Don Diego in Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Gentleman Dancing-Master</span> (1672). As this was the only play by Wycherley to be performed by the Duke's Company, it seems likely that the dramatist was attracted both by the elegance of the new playhouse at Dorset Garden, and by the opportunity it afforded to exploit the talents of Angel and Nokes. The play itself contains a reference to Angel's talent as a comedian, Wycherley's Hippolita suggesting that &#145;Angel is a very good Fool&#146;. Although Wycherley's Monsieur disagrees, preferring the talents of Nokes, he none the less concedes that in England &#145;all the beaux monde&#146; go to learn the art of foolery from the two comedians  (<span class="italic">Plays of William Wycherley</span>, 174&#150;5).<br>
<br>In addition to his fame as a mimic and clown, Angel had a reputation for improvisation. During the winter of 1667&#150;8 the actor's habit of interpolating topical innuendo while on stage may have landed him in trouble. On 2 January 1668, during the intermittent run of Dryden and Davenant's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, the lord chamberlain issued a warrant for the comedian's arrest. Although the reasons behind the order remain unclear, one possible explanation is that Angel had repeated the offence of James Lacy the previous season, causing offence with his talent for unscripted political satire. Several years later Aphra Behn expressed her own annoyance at Angel's propensity for comic improvisation. In the preface to <span class="italic">The Dutch Lover</span> (1673) she notes that the actor &#145;spoke little of what I intended for him, but supplied it with a great deal of idle stuff, which I was wholly unacquainted with until I heard it first from him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Aphra Behn</span>, 5.163).<br>
<br>In March 1673 Angel appeared as DeBoastado in Edward Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Careless Lovers</span>. This appears to have been his final performance, though the circumstances of the actor's death are unknown. Angel was buried in the burial-ground of St Clement Danes on 26 April 1673. Following his death <span class="italic">An Elegy, upon that Incomparable Comedian, Mr. Edward Angell</span> was printed and sold as a folded single-sheet poem. The lines, &#145;Written by C. B.&#146;, praise Angel's talent for comedy, calling him &#145;the best of mimiques&#146;. The elegist records how Angel's performances for the Duke's Company &#145;Rung Peals of Mirth, in Gallery, Box, and Pit&#146;, and insists that the loss felt by the actors and audiences at Dorset Garden will be shared by the court of Charles II. The poem concludes with a fitting epitaph:<blockquote>
<div>Here lies Ned Angel, who rul'd as he thought fit,<br>
</div>
<div>The English Stage of Comick, Mimick Wit.<br>
</div> (C. B., 38&#150;9)</blockquote>
