<span class="headword">Ashe,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1556&#150;1618), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, who first appears as a student of Barnard's Inn, was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1574; nothing is known of his parents or early life. He was called to the bar in January 1583 and was raised to the status of ancient of the inn in 1589. There is no record of his having practised the law. In 1588 there appeared his first work, a table to the <span class="italic">Reports</span> of Sir James Dyer, which was successful enough to be reprinted in 1600 and 1622; this was followed by an <span class="italic">Abridgement</span> of Edmund Plowden's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> (1597?; repr., 1607). In 1605 he published a table to the first five volumes of Edward Coke's <span class="italic">Reports</span>, dedicated to Coke, in the preface to which he made explicit the reasons why these reports were of such paramount importance. This volume was subsequently expanded to cover the full eleven volumes of Coke's <span class="italic">Reports</span> published in his lifetime (1618; repr., 1652). At the same time he culled from the reports a collection of useful maxims, publishing these in 1617 as <span class="italic">Fasciculus florum, or, A handfull of flowers gathered out of the severall bookes of the Rt. Hon. Sir Edward Coke</span> (1617). This appears to have attracted a degree of criticism, or ridicule, from a member of the North family, against which Ashe defended himself in a preface to an expanded second edition of the work in 1618, addressed &#145;to the captious and malicious detractors&#146;. More originally he had compiled from the year-books and other reports a collection of cases in which statutes had been extended by equitable interpretation, organizing these analytically and publishing them in 1609 under the title <span class="italic">Epieikeia</span>. The introduction to this work, a highly intelligent discourse on the nature of equity in English law, reveals Ashe's considerable skill as a lawyer. Five years later, in 1614, he described himself as &#145;Professor&#146; of the law in the title-page to his best-known work, <span class="italic">Le primer (second) volume del Promptuarie</span>. This was an analytical index to the year-books, complementing the abridgements of Fitzherbert and Brooke without in any way superseding them; it was well received by the legal profession. Throughout his life Ashe retained his connections with Gray's Inn, which came to his rescue as he discovered that, in terms of worldly success, legal writing was no substitute for legal practice. He was given an entitlement to free commons at the inn in 1614 while overseeing the production of his <span class="italic">Promptuarie</span>, and in 1617 he was granted an annual pension of &pound;5 on account of his indigence. He died at Gray's Inn in 1618, seemingly without any family; his administration, dated 20 October, valued his estate at &pound;5 10<i>s</i>., but noted him as a &#145;pauper&#146;.<br>
