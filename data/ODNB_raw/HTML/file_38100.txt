<span class="headword">Wallich,  George Charles</span>  (1815&#150;1899), <span class="occ">military surgeon and oceanographer</span>, was born on 16 November 1815 in Calcutta, India, the eldest of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28564/', "Nathaniel Wallich (1785&#150;1854)")</script>, a Danish-born surgeon and botanist, and his second wife, Sophia Collings. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine and graduated MD in 1836; he became a licentiate of the College of Surgeons (Edinburgh) the following year.<br>
<br>Wallich returned to India in 1838 as assistant surgeon in the Indian army and saw considerable active service during the next nineteen years, taking part in the Sutlej and Punjab campaigns of 1842 and 1847 and acting as field surgeon during the Santal rebellion of 1855&#150;6. In 1851, during his single furlough spent in England, he married Caroline Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Norton, a solicitor in Lowestoft. They had four sons and four daughters. Wallich returned to England on sick leave in 1857 and retired from the Indian army in 1859 with the rank of surgeon-major.<br>
<br>During the homeward voyage Wallich collected a variety of marine organisms, thus beginning the study of oceanography which was to dominate the remainder of his life. His reports on the collections brought him to the notice of the British scientific establishment and led to his appointment as naturalist in HMS <i>Bulldog</i> during a voyage under the command of Sir Leopold McClintock in 1860 to investigate a possible northern route for the proposed north-Atlantic telegraph cable.<br>
<br>Wallich reported the results of the <i>Bulldog</i> cruise in his most important publication, <span class="italic">The North-Atlantic Sea-Bed</span> (1862), which included his general views on deep-sea biology and in particular a refutation of the &#145;azoic theory&#146;, put forward by Edward Forbes in 1843, according to which the depths of the ocean beyond a few hundred metres were devoid of life. Wallich based his refutation mainly on a <i>Bulldog</i> sounding, at a depth of some 2300 metres, which brought up a number of brittle-stars entangled in the line. However, this evidence was generally regarded as inconclusive by the scientific world, and the credit for disproving the azoic theory went to Charles Wyville Thomson and W. B. Carpenter for their dredging results during the cruises of the <i>Lightning</i> and the <i>Porcupine</i> in 1868 and 1869.<br>
<br>Wallich published several significant scientific papers during the 1870s and 1880s, mainly on the classification of foraminiferans and on the role of the lower organisms in the formation of geological deposits. He also became an accomplished photographer, publishing privately a volume of excellent portraits of contemporary scientists. But his main preoccupation during the latter part of his life was about obtaining the public recognition which he felt he had been denied. This led him into a series of acrimonious exchanges, both private and public, with several notable scientists of the day, but mainly with Carpenter and Thomson, whom he also accused of plagiarizing his results, particularly those dealing with the biology of the foraminiferans. The controversy culminated in 1877 with Wallich's unsuccessful demand that the Royal Society should censure his two opponents; he believed that the society had tacitly condoned their misdemeanours by publishing their results in its prestigious journal, from which Wallich was debarred since he was not a fellow.<br>
<br>Although Wallich was never elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society, his work was recognized in 1898 by the award of the gold medal of the Linnean Society. Wallich undoubtedly felt that this recognition was too little and too late, and he remained bitter and resentful to his death, on 31 March 1899, at his home, 11 Nottingham Place, Baker Street, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
