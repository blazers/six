<span class="headword">Murray,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1297), <span class="occ">patriot and soldier</span>, came of a family, originally Flemish, which had settled in the province of Moray about the middle of the twelfth century. His father, Andrew Murray, was the lord of Petty, near Inverness, and of Avoch, in the Black Isle. In the war of 1296 between John, king of Scots, and Edward I of England, Murray fought from the outset on the Scottish side, and was captured with his father and his uncle, Sir William Murray le Riche, lord of Bothwell, at the battle of Dunbar on 27 April. He escaped from imprisonment in Chester in the following winter, however, and returned to Moray. The government which Edward imposed on Scotland after the defeat and forced abdication of King John had proved repressive and there was already growing opposition to it throughout the country. Although his father was still an English prisoner, in early 1297 Murray assumed leadership of what had by now become open rebellion in the north of Scotland. His campaign against the English opened inauspiciously with an abortive attempt on Castle Urquhart in May 1297, but over the next two months he enjoyed greater success, and his tactic of harassing and isolating garrisons gradually loosened the English grip on Moray. He was aided by the incompetence of the administration under John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1304), Edward's lieutenant, and Hugh of Cressingham, the treasurer, and by the equivocal attitude to the rebellion of Scottish magnates ostensibly loyal to Edward, and by August the principal castles in the region, including Elgin, Banff, and Inverness, had fallen to him.<br>
<br>Murray's achievements in the north had been matched by those of William Wallace to the south and, probably in late August, they merged their forces to meet the threat of an English army led by Warenne and Cressingham. At Stirling, on 11 September, the highly disciplined Scottish infantry under the joint command of Murray and Wallace inflicted a signal defeat on the English, whose losses in cavalry and infantry, with Cressingham among the dead, were high. But Murray himself received wounds which were ultimately fatal, and it is uncertain exactly what part he played, with Wallace, in the events which followed the battle. He and Wallace are named as &#145;commanders of the army of the kingdom of Scotland&#146; in a letter of 11 October to the mayors and communes of L&uuml;beck and Hamburg, and a similar style is employed in a letter of protection to Hexham Priory on 7 November. There is, however, no evidence that Murray actually participated in the invasion of northern England by then in progress and it is Wallace alone who is thereafter named as being in command of the Scots, suggesting that Murray died at some time during the month of November. His posthumous son, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19590/', "Andrew Murray")</script>, who was born at Whitsun 1298, later married Christian, sister of Robert I, and was guardian of Scotland during the minority of David II.<br>
