<span class="headword">Saunders, Sir  Alexander Morris  Carr-</span>  (1886&#150;1966), <span class="occ">sociologist and academic administrator</span>, was born at Reigate, Surrey, on 14 January 1886, by some fifteen years the youngest child of James Carr-Saunders, a wealthy underwriter, and his wife, Flora Anne Tower. He was proud of his descent from the architect Robert Morris and conscious of his affinity with two other relatives, W. W. and Edward Saunders, both entomologists and fellows of the Royal Society. In childhood he was lonely and at Eton College intensely unhappy. He left, aged sixteen, to spend two years in Paris and the French Alps. In this period he came to believe that it was in biology that the greatest advancement of learning would be made in the years ahead, and it was to read this subject that he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford. He took a first in zoology in 1908, was elected to the biological scholarship at Naples for a year, then returned to Oxford as a demonstrator in comparative anatomy.<br>
<br>It became clear to Carr-Saunders, however, that his interests extended beyond the laboratory. His imagination had been fired by the prospects for human betterment, opened by Mendel's rediscovered paper of 1865, and by the work of William Bateson on heredity. In 1910 he moved to London, where he studied biometrics under Karl Pearson, became secretary of the research committee of the Eugenics Education Society, and served as sub-warden of Toynbee Hall. He was elected to Stepney borough council, and in 1914 was called to the bar by the Inner Temple.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Carr-Saunders enlisted in the ranks of the infantry but he was commissioned in the Army Service Corps and, after a year in France, was posted to a depot at Suez, where he remained, against his will, for the rest of the war. His duties left him leisure to plan a work on population that would &#145;view the whole problem &hellip; from an historical and evolutionary standpoint&#146;. He came back in a state of depression and indecision, and accepted an offer to return to Oxford as a demonstrator in zoology. Here, however, he accomplished his grand design rapidly; his book <span class="italic">The Population Problem</span> (1922) did much to establish his reputation among his contemporaries, although it did not attract wide attention at the time. Forty years later it was claimed as having anticipated later developments in ethology by its stress on behaviour that contributes to the survival of the group, and on the practices by which groups are secured of their territory. His concern for the problems of population was to lead him to serve as chairman of the population investigation committee from 1936, and of the statistics committee of the royal commission on population from 1944 to 1949; he was instrumental in establishing the study of demography, and unflagging in his leadership of the Eugenics Society, which awarded him its first Galton medal in 1946.<br>
<br>In 1923 he was called to Liverpool as the first holder of the Charles Booth chair of social science. The task of directing a department proved highly congenial to him; the air of detachment that his colleagues felt in him did not prevent him from entering fully into the life of a civic university. His own publications meanwhile added to his reputation, especially the pioneering account of the history and structure of the professions (in a book of that title, with P. A. Wilson, 1933). He married in 1929 a former Oxford pupil, Teresa, daughter of Major Edmund Harington Molyneux-Seel, a professional soldier and Lancashire landowner; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The appointment to Liverpool had been quite unforeseen. Equally unforeseen but readily accepted was the call to Carr-Saunders in 1937 to succeed Sir William Beveridge as director of the London School of Economics (LSE). In the next nineteen years he held the school together through its exile during the war and presided over its ensuing expansion of numbers and activities. When he joined it he found an academic community agitated and divided by his predecessor's style of administration; he himself established his authority and restored harmony in the community by a style that was an absence of style. His simple and quiet approach to business flowed from his self-image; he saw himself as no more than a scholar among scholars animated by a common devotion. He was vigorous, even combative when necessary, and was able to transact business in the office rapidly. But in council his touch was as light as it was deft. Where sectional interests were latent his own selflessness diffused disinterest; discussions in which he never forcibly intervened served their therapeutic purpose and moved to generally accepted conclusions that seldom ran contrary to his own judgement.<br>
<br>When in 1943 Carr-Saunders joined the commission under Sir Cyril Asquith on higher education in the colonies he took up a task to which he was drawn alike by his scholarly and his humanitarian concern for its object. He created and became chairman both of the University of London senate committee, which guided the development of university colleges in east Africa, Sudan, central Africa, Nigeria, the Gold Coast, and the West Indies, and of the Inter-University Council, through which the help of all the British universities was given to the colleges and universities of the dependent territories. He was chairman in 1947 of the commission which promoted the University of Malaya, and in 1952&#150;3 of the commission which led to the foundation of the multiracial University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. On his retirement from the LSE, in December 1965, he devoted himself to this work more than ever, travelling continually to maintain personal contacts with the new colleges. He carried out the survey of the manpower requirements of the African universities presented to the Tananarive conference of 1962; his book <span class="italic">New Universities Overseas</span> (1961) gives an account of these developments.<br>
<br>Two interests formed in early years remained with Carr-Saunders throughout life. In the French Alps he had learned the craft of the mountaineer; he had a special knowledge of the Aiguilles Rouges and, while he was at Liverpool, he climbed Tryfan more than a hundred times. His first sight of Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican had opened a new world to him and he continued to find a lively pleasure in paintings and to collect them. He also had a lifelong interest in farming and country pursuits, finding happiness in their practical and creative aspects. He once remarked that the farmer is &#145;the man who does the only job that really matters&#146;. Seemingly withdrawn and remote he was keenly observant and warm in his attachments. In his private judgement of men he made sharp distinctions but in his dealings with them he was uniformly tolerant. His lean frame and ascetic, somewhat melancholy mien concealed great energy; the strength of his hands marked the tenacity which enabled him to carry through on his retirement a task that would have extended most men fully in the prime of life. His exertions responded to the breadth of his intellectual interests and his deep sense of social responsibility. As a young man he had been a sceptic in the tradition of the Victorian rationalists but his philosophic bent and concern for right action drew him insistently towards theology, and he found a faith within the Anglican fold.<br>
<br>Carr-Saunders was knighted in 1946, in which year he also became a fellow of the British Academy, and was appointed KBE in 1957. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Glasgow, Columbia, Natal, Dublin, Liverpool, Cambridge, Grenoble, Malaya, and London; he was also honorary fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, of the University College of East Africa, and of the LSE. He died near Dale Head, Thirl Moor, St John's in the Vale, Cumberland, on 6 October 1966.<br>
