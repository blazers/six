<span class="headword">Denham, Sir  John</span>  (1559&#150;1639), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son of William Denham (<i>d</i>. 1583), a goldsmith of St Matthew's, Friday Street, London, and later of Thorpe, Surrey, and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1589), perhaps a Prideaux. His sister Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1626) was the mother of the puritan exemplar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107351/', "Joan Drake")</script>. Nothing is known of his schooling; he entered Lincoln's Inn from Furnival's Inn in August 1579. Called to the bar on 29 June 1587, Denham was appointed with two fellow barristers in 1602 to refurbish the house library (which might link him with the John Denham who owned a fifteenth-century English verse life of St Cuthbert, now BL, Egerton MS 3309). Promoted bencher the following year, in 1604 he purchased the mansion of Imworth at Egham, Surrey, which he subsequently rebuilt. Having delivered his reading in Lent 1607 on the statute 31 Eliz. c. 6 (elections to colleges), he was created serjeant in May 1609 (naming the earl of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor Ellesmere as his patrons) and also knighted, preparatory to being sworn chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1612 Denham succeeded Humphrey Winch, another Lincoln's Inn lawyer, as chief justice of Ireland. Following the death that year of his first wife, Cicely Kellefet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Farr), who herself had been twice widowed before she married Denham in 1596, he married Eleanor Moore, the daughter of an Irish peer, about 1614; she was the mother of his first acknowledged child, the future poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7481/', "John Denham")</script>, at Dublin in 1614 or 1615. After serving as one of the lords justices during a vacancy in the viceroyalty from November 1615 until July 1616 Denham returned to England early the next year, and was appointed baron of the exchequer in May 1617. Eleanor died in childbed two years later; a monument erected by her husband in Egham church depicts her with a &#145;beautiful and ingenious visage&#146;  (Aubrey, <span class="italic">Natural History</span>, 3.157).<br>
<br>Denham remained on the judicial bench for another twenty years. Commended by the godly divine Richard Bernard as &#145;reverend and religious&#146;  (Bernard, sig. A4), Denham was nevertheless appointed to the ecclesiastical high commission in 1633, although he also joined Chief Justice Richardson in a celebrated attempt to suppress Somerset church ales. His written decision against the crown in the ship money trial was delivered shortly before his much anticipated death, which occurred at Egham on 6 January 1639. He was buried at Egham on 10 January. A long-time colleague memorialized Denham as &#145;an able, prudent, and good judge, of great integrity and honesty &hellip; who died with [the] good applause of all good and pious men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 113), but in 1637 a barrister characterized him as &#145;the old absurd Baron&#146;  (Bulstrode Whitelock to Edward Heath, BL, Add. MS 37343, fol. 147). His wealthy estate included lands in Essex, Suffolk, and Surrey, &#145;2000 or 1500 pounds in ready money, two houses well furnished, and much plate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 182).<br>
