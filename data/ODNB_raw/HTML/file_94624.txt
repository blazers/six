<span class="headword">Campbell,  John Lorne, of Canna</span>  (1906&#150;1996), <span class="occ">scholar of Scottish Gaelic folklore</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 1 October 1906, the eldest son of Colonel Duncan Campbell, laird of Inverneill, Argyll, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harriet, from New Jersey, USA. He was educated at Cargilfield School (near Edinburgh), Rugby School, and St John's College, Oxford. At Oxford he studied rural economy, graduating in 1929 and receiving a diploma in rural economy in 1930, but he also took up Gaelic studies under the guidance of John Fraser, then professor of Celtic at Jesus College. He had first become attracted to Gaelic on hearing young islanders speaking it in Oban, when he was in his teens. Rural economy and Gaelic studies were to be the twin interests of his working life.<br>
<br>Campbell's interests were quickly translated into action and publication. His <span class="italic">Highland Songs of the Forty-Five</span> was published in 1933, with full translations of thirty-two songs and poems by twelve eighteenth-century authors. In his preface he expressed his great indebtedness to John Fraser. A reprint, including corrections and additions, was published by the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society in 1984. In 1933 he went to Barra, in the southern Hebrides, where he met Compton Mackenzie. They set up the Sea League the same year, campaigning for strict fishing limits to protect local fishermen and fish stocks, and issuing <span class="italic">The Sea Leaguer</span>, a news-sheet for fishermen which included some Gaelic articles.<br>
<br>In 1934, while working on another book, <span class="italic">The Book of Barra</span>, with Compton Mackenzie, Campbell met Margaret Fay Shaw [<i>see below</i>]. They were married in Glasgow on 15 June 1935, with the service in Gaelic. There were no children. They both visited Nova Scotia soon after their marriage, and this began a long association with the Gaelic colonies in Canada, and collection of Gaelic songs from these communities. After three years together in Barra they bought the island of Canna, off the Inverness-shire coast, in 1938 (for &pound;9000), and lived there thereafter, developing farming and cattle rearing, and encouraging and protecting the native community. Campbell became known as Fear Chanaidh (the laird of Canna), but his was a benevolent lairdship. At Canna House he and Margaret built up a formidable library and collection of Gaelic recordings and highland photographs. In 1981 they gave the island of Canna to the National Trust for Scotland, and subsequently arranged for their archive to be retained and protected at Canna House.<br>
<br>Campbell continued to take a close interest in environmental and community issues, and in conservation. In 1939 he collaborated with Sir Alexander MacEwen to produce <span class="italic">Act Now for the Highlands and Islands</span>, which included the suggestion of a highland development board. Another special interest was in collecting butterflies, and he pursued this both in Canna and in Italy, where he and his wife went for holidays over many years. They also visited Canada and the USA regularly. Over the years he was a voluminous correspondent: a passing remark in a letter could often trigger a two-page response.<br>
<br>Campbell's range of publications was wide, including <span class="italic">Gaelic in Scottish Education and Life</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Father Allan McDonald of Eriskay, 1859&#150;1905</span> (1954), the Barra stories of John Macpherson, postmaster at Northbay, in <span class="italic">Tales from Barra Told by the Coddy</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The Furrow Behind Me</span>, the translated autobiography of the Hebridean crofter Angus MacLellan (1962), <span class="italic">B&agrave;rdachd Mhgr Ailein air a deasachadh</span>, Father Allan's Gaelic verse (1965), <span class="italic">A Collection of Highland Rites and Customs</span> (1975), and some joint publications, including, with Derick Thomson, <span class="italic">Edward Lhuyd in the Scottish Highlands, 1699&#150;1700</span> (1963), and, with Trevor H. Hall, <span class="italic">Strange Things: the Enquiry by the Society for Psychical Research into Second Sight in the Scottish Highlands</span> (1968). In 1984 he published <span class="italic">Canna: the Story of a Hebridean Island</span>, with revised editions in 1986 and 1994. There was also a continuous flow of articles in periodicals, on historical and literary topics, including several on the poetry of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair.<br>
<br>This wide range of publications contributed greatly to the understanding of highland life and history, but there can be little doubt that Campbell's most enduring life work was on Gaelic song as preserved in the oral tradition. He became deeply involved in this study in his Barra years, with the added stimulus of his wife's collecting work in South Uist, and this interest extended to the Gaelic colonies in Nova Scotia. Campbell converted to Catholicism at some point in the late 1930s, and had a tendency to concentrate on songs collected in Catholic areas, especially South Uist and Barra. With Francis Collinson he edited the three-volume <span class="italic">Hebridean Folksongs: a Collection of Waulking Songs made by Donald MacCormick in Kilphedir in South Uist in the Year 1893</span> (1969, 1977, 1981), and in 1990 he published <span class="italic">Songs Remembered in Exile</span>. The latter was a collection of traditional Gaelic songs from Nova Scotia, recorded in Cape Breton and Antigonish county in 1937; the tunes had mostly been transcribed by S&eacute;amus Ennis, a noted Irish collector of folk-song. Campbell's work on folk-song helped greatly to define the body of surviving work, particularly from the Catholic Hebrides and Nova Scotia, and especially in oral versions recorded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br>
<br>Campbell died on 25 April 1996 while he and his wife were on holiday near Fiesole, Florence, Italy, and staying in a nunnery in which there were Gaelic-speaking nuns. He was buried in woodland near Canna House on the island of Canna. He had been awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Glasgow, Oxford, and St Francis Xavier in Antigonish, and had been made an OBE in 1990.<br>
<br>Campbell's wife, <a name="cosubject_94624"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Fay Shaw</span>  (1903&#150;2004), <span class="occ">folklorist and musicologist</span>, was born on 9 November 1903 at Glenshaw, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, the fifth and youngest daughter of Henry Clay Shaw (<i>d</i>. 1918), a civil engineer whose family owned a steel foundry, and his wife Maria Frances (Fanny), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Patchin (<i>d</i>. 1911), from Old Bennington, Vermont. The Shaws were descended from John Shaw, who had emigrated from Scotland to Philadelphia in 1782 and had been granted land in the west of the state, on which Glenshaw was built. After her parents' deaths she was brought up by her elder sisters and educated at a boarding school in Bryn Mawr, near Philadelphia, where she cultivated a talent for the piano. In 1921 she was for a year sent to Scotland, where she attended St Bride's School, Helensburgh, near Glasgow, and where she first heard Hebridean folksongs performed in English by the collector Marjory Kennedy-Fraser. Five years later she returned to Scotland to trace the songs' Gaelic origins in a tour that saw her and a sister bicycle the length of the Hebrides from Castlebay to Port of Ness. Between 1929 and 1935 she lived at North Glendale, near Lochboisdale on South Uist, an island to which she formed a deep and lifelong attachment. There she lived with two sisters from whom she learned Scottish Gaelic, which was essential for the transcription of the island's songs and the stories that led to their composition. Part of this research was published in 1955 as <span class="italic">Folksongs and Folklore of South Uist</span>, her principal work, which provided a rich blend of different song types, stories, proverbs, and recipes, as well as photographs taken by her. New editions appeared in 1977 and 1986, and in 1993 she published an autobiography, <span class="italic">From the Alleghenies to the Hebrides</span>, which recalled her experience of the Aran Islands and St Kilda (during the government enforced evacuation of 1930), as well as of life on South Uist. Following her marriage to John Lorne Campbell she lived first in Barra and from 1938 on the island of Canna, where at Canna House she continued her research, provided a home to numerous cats, and played her Steinway grand piano for the couple's many visitors. In 1981 the couple gave the island to the National Trust for Scotland. She continued to live on Canna until after her hundredth birthday, which was marked by a BBC television programme, <span class="italic">Among Friends</span>. In recognition of her work she received honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh, St Francis Xavier, and the National University of Ireland, and in November 2004 she became an honorary fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. She died at Belford Hospital, Fort William, on 11 December 2004, of kidney failure.<br>
