<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meadows, Sir  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1626, <em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was baptized at Chattisham, Suffolk, on 4 January 1626, the fifth son of Daniel Meadows (1577&#150;1651) of Chattisham and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1678), daughter and coheir of Robert Smith of Wickham Market, and the grandson of William Meadows (<i>d</i>. 1588) of Witnesham. His grandfather's elder son, William Meadows, married the heir of Witnesham Hall, and his father bought the lordship of the manor in 1630. Philip was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 18 February 1642 and graduated BA in 1646. He proceeded MA from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1649 and became a fellow.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In 1653, on the recommendation of John Thurloe, Meadows was recruited as Latin translator to the council of state to assist the blind John Milton&#151;Milton's preference for Andrew Marvell was overridden. On 17 October Meadows was chosen to assist Thurloe in foreign affairs as well, his salary doubled to &pound;200 per annum, and he gave enough satisfaction to be confirmed as full &#145;Latin Secretary&#146;, Milton remaining &#145;Latin Secretary Extraordinary&#146;, in Thurloe's list of officials to the protectoral council of state on 3 February 1654  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 386).<br>
<br>Meadows's growing knowledge of foreign affairs as Thurloe's assistant and his expertise in Latin were such that on 19 February 1656 the council advised Oliver Cromwell to appoint him envoy to Portugal to seek the ratification of the Anglo-Portuguese treaty of 1654. England's conflict with Spain, with which Portugal was also at war, meant that English warships needed access to Portuguese ports and that merchants excluded from Spain sought Portuguese markets. However, the treaty was contentious in Portugal as Cromwell had required the fervently Catholic government to accept the open practice of protestantism by English residents and had sought compensation for Portuguese aid to royalist privateers. Tension had been increased by the execution in London, following conviction for murder, of the Portuguese ambassador's brother, Dom Pantaleon de Sa, in defiance of his diplomatic immunity. Meadows was required to secure an immediate payment of &pound;50,000 damages on penalty of attack, and sailed from Plymouth on the <i>Phoenix</i> on 11 March. However, King Jo&atilde;o VI proved obstinate, over both compensation and the opening of a protestant church in Lisbon, and in order to intimidate him Cromwell duly ordered his navy to seize the Portuguese &#145;plate fleet&#146;, <i>en route</i> for Lisbon. Vengeful relatives of Dom Pantaleon tried to shoot Meadows as he left the palace on 1 May; as it happened, he was only slightly injured in the hand, but the perpetrators were not arrested. Given Cromwell's high-handedness and the previous murders of Commonwealth ambassadors in Madrid and Holland, a violent English reaction and subsequent collapse of the treaty was probable. Meadows was instructed to give Jo&atilde;o five days to sign and then, if he refused, to join the English fleet, but in order to continue negotiations he delayed departing until the fleet anchored at Cascaes on 30 May. When Meadows then requested a farewell audience, the king promptly signed and provided the compensation. The envoy's gamble paid off, but he faced criticism from Admiral Robert Blake and his assistant Edward Mountagu for not leaving earlier. The money delivered, Meadows arrived on Mountagu's ship to be told Whitehall would have preferred him to cancel the negotiations. He wrote to Thurloe that the risks entailed in trying to find the plate fleet to retaliate outweighed the pecuniary advantage of capturing it, and that the personal insult to himself of the attack was better dealt with separately from national-level negotiations. His success was duly commended in England, and on 15 July the council voted him a ninety-nine-year lease on lands worth &pound;100 &#145;in consideration of the maim received &hellip; in execution of his duty&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1656&#150;7</i>, 22). There was, however, difficulty in finding lands, though confiscated episcopal estates were considered, and the case was still outstanding in August 1657. The money presumably helped Meadows in his subsequent purchase of an estate at Bentley, Suffolk.<h2>
<a name="Balticdiplomacy"></a>Baltic diplomacy</h2>Meadows returned to England in November and resumed his duties as Thurloe's deputy; Marvell replaced him as Latin secretary in 1657. His diplomatic success led to the council's selecting him on 24 February 1657 for the equally difficult role of ambassador to Denmark at a time when Cromwell was endeavouring to keep the peace between the two leading protestant powers in the Baltic, Denmark and Sweden, to secure access to shipping supplies and to divert Charles X of Sweden's aggressiveness against exclusively Catholic targets. Meadows's allowance was to be an impressive &pound;1000 per annum, but his departure was delayed by pressure of council business and the kingship debate, and in June Frederick III of Denmark declared war on Sweden. When Meadows was finally given his instructions, he was told to try to persuade Frederick that war only assisted Habsburg plans to weaken protestantism and endangered commercial access to the Baltic; he was to offer to mediate with Sweden to prevent Charles seizing more Danish territory. He sailed on the <i>Assistance</i> in August, a Mr. Sterry taking on his council duties, and was received honourably by Frederick at Copenhagen about 20 September. Frederick declared that he would accept &#145;equal and honourable terms&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 6.533), but Cromwell did not send Meadows detailed instructions, and when the Sound froze Charles was able in February 1658 to march his army over the ice on Copenhagen. Cromwell was personally sympathetic to Charles, but Meadows proceeded to the king's camp with the Dutch and French ambassadors to endeavour to moderate his demands. He shuttled between the Danish and Swedish commissioners, whose initial demands he reckoned &#145;both monsters, the one <i>in defectu</i> and the other <i>in excessu</i>&#146;  (ibid., 802&#150;03), while Charles continued to advance, and claimed &#145;unless I make a peace, adieu Denmark&#146;  (Meadows, <span class="italic">A Narrative</span>, 59). Meadows rejected Charles's proposal to occupy all Norway on the grounds that it would give the Swedish king control of shipping materials vital to England, &#145;too great a treasure to be entrusted to one hand&#146;  (ibid.). The threat of England's combining with the Dutch finally persuaded Charles to accept at Roskilde on 8 March a peace founded on Sweden's occupation of both the Trondheim province (thus cutting Norway in two) and Denmark's last possession east of the Sound, Scania. Crucially, at Meadows's insistence, &#145;hostile&#146;  (ibid., 62) warships were banned from the Sound, rather than all foreign warships, a proposal which &#145;though immediately levelled against Holland, yet obliquely and remotely reflected upon England&#146;  (ibid.). Charles had allegedly paid Meadows 9000&#150;10,000 rixdollars in an attempt to influence him, evidently without effect.<br>
<br>The treaty of Roskilde was Meadows's greatest achievement, but it only served as a temporary brake on Charles X's ambitions; Meadows commented that the sword which he presented to the king to use against the Habsburgs could easily be wielded against Brandenburg. He vainly begged Thurloe to send the outstanding &pound;30,000 in aid promised to Sweden. In April he was sent to Charles's peace conference with Poland at Braunsberg to prevent any terms to England's disadvantage and to promote war against the Habsburgs. Charles used the peace to attack Denmark again in August, and Cromwell's death weakened England's position. Still attending the Swedish court as Charles attacked Copenhagen again that winter (while the Dutch and Brandenburg assisted Denmark), Meadows found Charles appealing for assistance which he could not give. In April 1659 Mountagu brought the English fleet out to join the Dutch, and Meadows sought to mediate on the basis of the Roskilde settlement. This foundation was accepted at The Hague negotiations in June, but the upheavals in England, illustrated by the dispatch of Algernon Sidney and other commissioners to watch Mountagu, diminished England's potential role, and in August the recall of most of the fleet undermined Meadows's bargaining position. He requested his recall, which the council of state granted on 23 August; the eventual treaty of Copenhagen in 1660 was reached without him.<h2>
<a name="Restorationauthor"></a>Restoration author</h2>Meadows had been knighted by Cromwell in the spring of 1658 in recognition of Roskilde and had been made knight marshal of the household, while Frederick III had knighted him in the order of the Elephant. However, Meadows returned to England to be evicted from his Whitehall lodgings (7 February 1660), though he was unmolested at the Restoration. On 4 April 1661 he was granted a licence to marry Constance Lucy, second daughter and eventual coheir of Francis Lucy of Westminster (from the Charlecote family). He retired to his new estate at Bentley, and had sufficient reputation to be knighted by Charles II on 24 November 1662; on 15 January 1664 the king granted him an augmentation to his arms in return for surrendering that assumed through his Danish knighthood. In 1669 Meadows was advising the deputy secretary of state, Joseph Williamson, on his recollection of the terms of the treaty of Copenhagen in 1660, saying that he had copies of all the treaties involving France and the Dutch since 1621 in his possession. This collection was useful when he utilized his leisure to write on diplomacy; in 1677 he published <span class="italic">A narrative of the principal actions in the wars betwixt Sweden and Denmark before and after the Roskilde treaty</span>, including a view of the current Swedish involvement in Germany as it affected England. In 1681 he published <span class="italic">A Brief Enquiry into Leagues and Confederacies Made betwixt Princes and Nations</span>, with particular reference to England's abandoning the triple alliance to combine with France in destroying their confederate, Holland, and then abandoning France to make peace. He concluded that man was &#145;bound to the true and just performance&#146; of contracts as &#145;declarative testimony&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scarce and Valuable Tracts &hellip; Lord Somers</span>, ed. Scott, 8.21&#150;8) of private intentions, while accepting that princes could alter decisions as circumstances changed to protect their subjects; criticism of Charles II's vacillations was implied. In 1689 followed <span class="italic">Observations Concerning the Dominion and Sovereignty of the Seas</span>, a work influenced by John Selden, in which Meadows considered England's claim to salutation of the flag (with its inconsistencies and dangers), marine jurisdiction, and the theory of dominion of the seas.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Having lived from 1666 partly in Newport Street, Covent Garden, in 1685 Meadows acquired a house in the new Gerrard Street development, and that April joined the commission set up to hasten the building of the parish church, St Anne's, Soho. In 1675 Danby reckoned that Meadows exercised influence on two Lucy relatives in parliament but he was not otherwise politically prominent. The revolution of 1688 brought him greater favour, and on 28 January 1692 he became a commissioner for public accounts. On 19 December 1695 he also became a commissioner for trade and the plantations, and remained active in the role into his eighties; in March 1696 he joined the commission for excise. In 1696 he advised the suspected Jacobite plotter Thomas, Lord Ailesbury, to give himself up to the secretaries of state; Ailesbury called him &#145;grave and ancient and formal, but he had a good and solid judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 373). Meadows also concluded an important marriage alliance for his eldest son, Philip, with a niece of Sidney Godolphin. He resigned from the excise commission in November 1702 but remained a commissioner for trade, as of 1697 at a salary of &pound;1000 per annum, until December 1715.<br>
<br>Meadows died at Hammersmith on 16 September 1718, his age variously given as ninety-three or ninety-four, and was buried at Hammersmith Chapel on 18 September; the menfolk of his family were frequently long-lived. Of his three daughters, Elizabeth married Sir Thomas Powis, Constance married Joseph Craggs, and the third married Richard Dyott, commissioner of stamp duties in 1708&#150;10. A skilled, pragmatic diplomat, Meadows had played a major role in protectoral foreign relations in mitigating the effects of Cromwell's and Mountagu's desire to intimidate Portugal in 1656, helping to secure vital naval bases, and Cromwell's na&iuml;ve belief in Charles X's potential as an anti-Habsburg weapon in 1657&#150;8. His success at Roskilde would have been impossible without French and Dutch backing and did not bind Charles X to Cromwell, but both there and with Portugal Meadows showed more realism than his master and his subsequent writings show a professional expertise in the subjects of international relations and naval power from which the Stuarts could have benefited.<br>
<br>Meadows's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_18480"></a><span class="headword">Sir Philip Meadows</span>  (1662?&#150;1757), <span class="occ">diplomat and politician</span>, was born almost certainly in 1662. On 30 August 1696 he married Dorothy (<i>c</i>.1675&#150;<i>c</i>.1749), sister of Hugh Boscawen and niece of Lord Godolphin, at Lambeth, with Archbishop Thomas Tenison officiating; John Evelyn, congratulating Meadows senior, reckoned them &#145;a most virtuous discreet young virgin and as hopeful a young gentleman&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 5.258). On 4 August 1698 Meadows joined his father as a commissioner of excise (until March 1700), and on 27 June 1700 was appointed knight marshal of the king's household (a post held by his father under Cromwell) and marshal of the Marshalsea for life. Lord Jersey, who had disposed of the offices, was reckoned to have been paid about &pound;5000. On 23 December Meadows was knighted at Hampton Court, and in 1703 added the clerkship of the green cloth to his emoluments.<br>
<br>In 1702 Meadows entered parliament as MP for Truro, a seat controlled by his brother-in-law Hugh Boscowen. As in his father's case, Whitehall office was the precursor to diplomacy and in January 1704 he became ambassador to Holland, an important position at a critical point in the war of Spanish Succession when William III's death had put the onus of maintaining the alliance on officials. At the 1705 general election Meadows was elected in his absence MP for Tregony, another Boscawen borough. In December 1706, having reportedly at first declined the honour, he was appointed special envoy to Vienna to maintain relations with another crucial ally, Emperor Josef I, and was awarded &pound;500 for his equipage and &pound;720 per quarter in his dual role as envoy and plenipotentiary. In this capacity he not only worked to maintain the military alliance but, as his father had, kept a watchful eye on protestant interests, making a determined protest to Josef in November 1708 against Habsburg persecution of Silesian protestants.<br>
<br>In June 1708, while he was still abroad, Meadows was appointed joint commissioner for army accounts; Richmond House in the Privy Garden, Whitehall, was fitted up as an office. He was replaced as ambassador by Lord Raby in August 1709, and on his return to London on 16 October took up his new duties. He also acquired the lease of a house between Richmond House and the Thames, and in January 1714 became a governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. He was retained in office by George I with James Bruce as his colleague; Narcissus Luttrell reckoned him &#145;a worthy person, but not so vigilant as the other&#146;  (Luttrell, <span class="italic">Brief Relation</span>, 6.648). Clearly benefiting from nepotism but politically inoffensive to any of the whig factions, he remained in position until his death, living in Whitehall until some time prior to 1738 and subsequently at Richmond and Brompton. He died at Brompton on 3 December 1757, aged ninety-five, leaving three sons and five daughters. His eldest son, Sydney (<i>d</i>. 1792), succeeded him as marshal of the household; his third son, Philip (<i>d</i>. 1781), deputy ranger of Richmond Park, married Frances Pierrepoint, through which arrangement their sons Evelyn and Charles became heirs to the extinct dukedom of Kingston.<br>
