<span class="headword">Walker,  Kenneth MacFarlane</span>  (1882&#150;1966), <span class="occ">urologist and author</span>, was born on 6 June 1882 in Hampstead, London, the third child of William James Walker (1844&#150;1905), a Ceylon merchant, and his wife, Isabella MacFarlane (1881&#150;1921), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Currie. Both his parents were Scottish but were permanently settled in the south and Walker spent much of his childhood on a small estate in Essex where he acquired a taste for, and some skill in, country sports. He attended Leys School in Cambridge and, having chosen medicine rather than the family business, entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to work for the natural sciences tripos. He gained first-class honours in 1904. He went on to St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in London where, having overcome his initial repugnance for the unsavoury aspects of advanced disease, he developed a lifelong commitment to his profession. His autobiographical writings reveal the conflicting ambitions of these early years, the craving for adventure, for exploration, for a missionary role in bringing relief to the sick and suffering, and more prosaically for attaining fame and fortune as a Harley Street consultant. He took opportunities during his training to explore Iceland, to climb in Switzerland, to tour India, and to trek in east Africa. His successful student career and house surgeoncy gave him hopes of professional advancement.<br>
<br>Walker qualified in 1906, gained the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons at the minimum age, and set about research into disorders of the bladder. However, the prospect of many unrewarding years in a junior capacity seemed altogether too unadventurous and in 1910 he took a resident post in Argentina at the British Hospital in Buenos Aires. There he soon built up a private surgical practice, and also kept in touch with the London surgical scene, and at the outbreak of war he returned to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In 1918 he was appointed OBE but refused to accept it, believing that honour to be little better than a music-hall joke and that he deserved something better.<br>
<br>Walker next contemplated going into research but nothing was on offer and Harley Street beckoned. He was appointed officer in charge of the venereal diseases department at St Bartholomew's, where his work resulted in a particular concern with the social and psychological consequences of sexual disorders. In the previous century such expertise could well have led to a place on the full surgical staff, but in the 1920s it was considered appropriate only for genito-urinary surgeons and the teaching hospital could not yet contemplate such specialization. Walker thus became a urologist with appointments at smaller London voluntary hospitals and at St Paul's Hospital for Urinary Diseases in Covent Garden. One of the first in Britain to attempt the endoscopic operation for the relief of prostatic obstruction, he was quick to take up new ideas and to publish his experience, but he was not himself responsible for any major advance. With an established consulting practice dealing with psycho-sexual as well as surgical problems he was particularly conscious of the mental as well as the physical aspects of disease, a concern which was to lead him on to philosophical speculations.<br>
<br>A handsome, athletic, and good-humoured man, Walker was popular with his professional colleagues and on the hunting field, but being curiously careless in his clothing he never quite adopted the style of the complete Harley Street consultant. On 24 April 1926 he married Eileen Marjorie (1903&#150;1983), only daughter of Frederick H. Wilson, with whom he had a son and a daughter. This marriage ended in divorce in 1944. His second wife, whom he married on 23 September 1944, was Mary Gabrielle Piggot 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ginnett; <i>b</i>. 1908)
  , the divorced wife of an artist. In addition to his Harley Street house he had a country home, Woodcutters, at Little London, South Ambersham in Sussex, where he enjoyed the garden and walking beneath the arching trees of what he called the Cathedral Wood. He remained active and in good health until the last years of his life, when he gradually withdrew from medical practice and gave more and more time to authorship.<br>
<br>Writing came easily to Walker and no fewer than fifty-three books by him are held in the British Library, though there is considerable repetition of the major themes. His prose is straightforward, readily comprehensible, and displays in a multiplicity of quotations a wide acquaintance with the literature of history and philosophy. His first non-medical publication was a children's book, <span class="italic">The Log of the Ark</span>. His professional works included <span class="italic">Enlarged Prostate</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Manual of Male Disorders of Sex</span> (1939), but he endeavoured to interpret modern medicine to the laity in <span class="italic">The Circle of Life</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">A Doctor Digresses</span> (1950). At a time when there was little factual information available to the general public on the subject, his <span class="italic">Physiology of Sex and its Social Implications</span>, published in the <span class="roman">Pelican</span> series in 1940, was well received. In <span class="italic">The Intruder: an Unfinished Self-Portrait</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">I Talk of Dreams</span> (1946), he interweaves the story of his life with an exploration of the nature of the human mind.<br>
<br>It was Walker's search for a true philosophy of medicine and for an understanding of the relationship between body and mind which became the pre-occupation of his later years. In 1923 Walker had been introduced to a discussion group led by P. D. Ouspensky, a Russian journalist then expounding the esoteric philosophy of G. I. Gurdjieff, and Walker found in his teachings much to resolve his earlier difficulties. He met the philosopher himself in 1948 and subsequently wrote a series of books, starting with <span class="italic">Venture with Ideas</span> (1951), in which he endeavours to explain in simple language the amalgam of analysis and mysticism in Gurdjieff's philosophy. Walker's prose is lucid but for most readers the matter remains obscure. The Buddhist element in his beliefs came increasingly to the fore; happily for his family he never attempted to proselytize. Walker died at Pendean, West Lavington, Sussex, on 22 January 1966; his body was cremated and his ashes scattered in the woods near his Sussex home.<br>
