<span class="headword">Buller,  William</span>  (1735&#150;1796), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was born at Morval, Cornwall, on 9 August 1735, the fourth son of John Francis Buller (<i>bap</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. 1751) of Morval and Shillingham, and his wife, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1743), third daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27689/', "Sir Jonathan Trelawny")</script>, bishop of Winchester. William matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 10 April 1753, aged seventeen, but soon moved to Christ Church. He graduated BA in 1757 and MA in 1759; he subsequently took the degrees of BD and DD in 1781.<br>
<br>Buller's career in the church owed a great deal to an astute marriage, on 19 April 1762, to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1800), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27223/', "John Thomas (1696&#150;1781)")</script>, bishop of Winchester and, from 1763, clerk of the closet to George III. Buller's father-in-law had previously granted him the lucrative rectory of Brightwell in Berkshire, which he held until 1766, and named him canon of the twelfth prebend in Winchester Cathedral. Buller subsequently received the rectories of Wonston and Houghton in Hampshire, followed by the rectories of Alresford and Overton in 1776. A mandamus was issued for Buller's preferment as a canon of Windsor on 22 December 1773.<br>
<br>Buller resigned this last stall when he was elected dean of Exeter on 25 March 1784. The high point of his office was entertaining George III, Queen Charlotte, and members of their family at the deanery during the royal visit to Exeter in August 1789. Buller, who was &#145;very civil and in high glee&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 1.310), followed a service in the cathedral with a private tour for the party and made sure it was he rather than the city authorities who entertained the king and queen. A grateful monarch took a special interest in enabling Buller, in 1790, to exchange one deanery for another, namely Canterbury, on George Horne's promotion to the episcopate. Buller was not slow to follow Horne to the House of Lords, returning to Exeter as bishop in 1792 in a career move that was unusual for the Hanoverian church but popular locally because of Buller's west-country background. As with Horne, Buller was past his best by the time of his last promotion, suffering from continuous ill health and domestic loss. He was a dutiful, orthodox cleric whose family associations and connections held the key to his advancement. As a bishop his major undertaking was to hold a primary visitation for the Exeter diocese in 1793&#150;4, and was one of the supporters of the 1796 act to improve the income of poor curates. Indeed, the number of ordinands in the diocese ran at its highest level for the century during Buller's episcopate. He was made a freeman of Exeter in August 1793.<br>
<br>Buller enjoyed episcopal rank for only four years before dying of dropsy in the chest on 12 December 1796 at Downes, near Crediton in Devon, the seat of his son-in-law. He was buried in the south choir aisle of Exeter Cathedral on 17 December. His wife, Anne, died on 28 August 1800 and was buried on 3 September 1800. One son, Richard, survived him as did two daughters, Anne and Susannah Catherine. He published only sermons, including one preached before the House of Lords on 9 March 1796 for the general fast.<br>
