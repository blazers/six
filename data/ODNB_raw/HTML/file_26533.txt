<span class="headword">Stirling <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hehl]</span>,  Mary Anne <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1813&#150;1895), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 29 July 1813 in Queen Street, Mayfair, Westminster, one of the three children of Captain Simon Hehl (<i>fl</i>. 1780&#150;1840) of the regiment of foot guards and his wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas (<i>fl</i>. 1780&#150;1840). Her stage career, prompted by her father's improvidence, was largely in London's principal theatres and spanned more than fifty years. She excelled in comedy, in which she was regarded as the successor of Dorothy Jordan (1761&#150;1816) and Julia Glover (1781&#150;1850), but was remarkable for her versatility. She was educated at the Catholic seminary Brook Green House, Hammersmith, and at a convent abroad. There are conflicting accounts of her first years on the stage, possibly at the East London Theatre, but on 9 January 1832, under the name of Fanny Clifton, she appeared as Zephyrina in <span class="italic">The Devil and the Widow</span> at the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel. Here she met the actor (and later manager and prolific playwright) Edward Lambert (1807&#150;1894), whom she married on 3 July 1832. In the next years the couple, known as Mr and Mrs Stirling, were engaged at the Liverpool Amphitheatre, the Queen's Theatre, Manchester&#151;where what was probably Stirling's first play, <span class="italic">Sadak and Kalasrade</span>, was performed&#151;and, in 1835, the Theatre Royal, Birmingham.<br>
<br>Mrs Stirling's reputation now took her to the Adelphi Theatre, London, where she first appeared on 1 January 1836 as Biddy Nutts in J. B. Buckstone's melodrama <span class="italic">The Dream at Sea</span>. The next two years saw her as a leading player in companies at the New Strand and St James's theatres and, briefly, the Garrick Theatre, Whitechapel. In May 1837 at the New Strand, as Nell Gwynne in Douglas Jerrold's eponymous play, she provided the first of her interpretations of past actresses. Five days later she played Emily Wilton in <span class="italic">Bachelors Buttons</span>, written specially for her by her husband. For a short period she was &#145;withdrawn&#146; from the stage by Stirling and it was probably at about this time that the couple separated. She resumed her career in 1839 at the Lyceum, went on to Drury Lane, and, after a brief spell at the Olympic, was recruited by William Charles Macready in September 1840 for the Haymarket Theatre. Here she earned some praise as Constance in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Love Chase</span>, Sophia in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, and Clara in Bulwer Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span>; Macready observed of this last that &#145;She speaks with a freshness and truth of tone that no other actress &hellip; can now do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 2.114).<br>
<br>Fanny Stirling's daughter, also named Fanny, who was to have a brief stage career and from whom she became alienated, was born on 7 February 1842. Mrs Stirling returned to the theatre for Macready's second season at Drury Lane. Here, on 1 October 1842 as Celia, she shared the company's acclaim for <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> and won personal praise the following month as Mrs Foresight in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>. Robert Browning's <span class="italic">A Blot in the Scutcheon</span>, in which she was badly cast as Gwendolen, was a comprehensive failure. Short periods again at the Strand Theatre and Drury Lane were followed by three years (until June 1847) at the Princess's Theatre, where her many parts included Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, Cordelia in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, and Hermia in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. She created the title role in Thomas Lacy's <span class="italic">Clarissa Harlowe</span>.<br>
<br>Mrs Stirling's most sustained period of success began in 1848 under Madame Vestris at the Lyceum Theatre, where in December she portrayed another actress, Mrs Bracegirdle, in John Oxenford's <span class="italic">The Tragedy Queen</span>. At the Olympic Theatre she was noted for her mixture of tenderness and vivacity as Laura Leeson in Courtnay's <span class="italic">Time Tries All</span>. At the New Strand Theatre in October 1849 she gave what she believed were her best performances, as the tragic Adrienne Lecouvreur in <span class="italic">The Reigning Favourite</span>, a play translated from the French by Oxenford and based on the life of an eighteenth-century French actress. Her chief success in the first season at the newly rebuilt Olympic was in January 1851 as Martha Gibbs in <span class="italic">All that Glitters is not Gold</span>, by John M. Morton and Thomas Morton junior. Among other new plays in which she shone was Charles Reade's <span class="italic">The Ladies' Battle</span>, in which, on 7 May 1851, she created the role of the Countess. At the Haymarket she starred from 20 November 1852 in what was to become one of her most popular parts, as the actress Peg Woffington in Reade and Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span>. In October 1853 she was back at the Olympic, where Taylor's <span class="italic">Plot and Passion</span> was first mounted on 17 October with Mrs Stirling as Marie de Fontanges. In March 1854 she played Mrs Trotter Southdown in the same author's <span class="italic">To Oblige Benson</span>.<br>
<br>In succeeding years Mrs Stirling was dogged by poor health and failing sight and performed less frequently. In the 1860s she turned increasingly to giving readings and teaching elocution privately&#151;for a time at the London Academy of Music. However, she had not wholly retired. She was criticized for &#145;stealing the show&#146; as the Nurse in a celebrated production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> at the Lyceum Theatre, with Henry Irving as Romeo and Ellen Terry as Juliet, which ran from 8 March 1882 for 130 performances. She played the Nurse again in the Lyceum's 1884 production. Her last original part was as Lady Caryll in A. W. Pinero's <span class="italic">Lords and Commons</span> at the Haymarket Theatre, which opened in March 1885, while her final appearances, again with Irving and Terry at the Lyceum, were as Martha in W. G. Wills's version of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span> between 19 December 1885 and 31 July 1886.<br>
<br>Mrs Stirling was beautiful, graceful, and indomitable, and was regarded as &#145;one of the most vivacious and bewitching comedy actresses of her time&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Dec 1895). Her first husband described her style, which could tend to exaggeration, as &#145;essentially of the French school, elegant and piquant&#146;  (Stirling, 2.220).<br>
<br>Within weeks of her first husband's death Mrs Stirling married an old friend, Sir Charles Hutton Gregory KCMG (1817&#150;1898), a civil engineer. She died of dropsy on 28 December 1895 at 3 Duchess Street, Marylebone, London, and was buried at Brompton cemetery on 1 January 1896.<br>
