</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clitherow, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1577/8&#150;1641), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was the only son of Henry Clitherow (<i>d</i>. 1608), a merchant, of the parish of St Andrew Undershaft, London, and his first wife, Bridget, the daughter of Thomas Hewett. He was presumably descended from Richard or William Clitheroe, both of whom migrated to London and Kent towards the end of the fourteenth century from the Lancashire town from which they took their name. His paternal grandfather became a junior warden of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1521, while his father, who traded in cloth, wine, and cordage and invested in privateering, achieved the distinction of being elected master of the Ironmongers' Company on four separate occasions.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Clitherow entered St John's College, Oxford, in 1593 at the age of fifteen, and followed his father into the Ironmongers' Company in 1601. In the same year he was admitted to the newly formed East India Company, in which he invested &pound;240, and from which he undoubtedly made a handsome profit. Membership of the revived but short-lived Spanish Company (1604) soon followed, and after his father's death he joined the Virginia (1609), French (1611), and North-West Passage (1612) companies. It is not known when he entered the Eastland, Muscovy or Russia, and Levant companies, but he served as one of the Levant Company's assistants in 1616. The only major trading company to which Clitherow did not subscribe was the Company of Merchant Adventurers, whose interests he opposed; he joined instead the New Company of Merchant Adventurers in 1615, the body briefly established in its place by Sir William Cokayne. Both his marriages were to daughters of fellow merchants. Catherine Rowland (<i>d</i>. 1606), whom he had married by 1601, was the daughter of Thomas Rowland (<i>d</i>. 1593), a London draper. Sir Thomas Cambell, to whose daughter Mary (<i>d</i>. 1646) Clitherow was married by 1608, was a leading figure in the Ironmongers' and East India companies.<br>
<br>Although Clitherow was obliged to disburse more than &pound;215 towards settlement of the Muscovy Company's debts in 1624 and lost whatever money he sank into the ill-fated Virginia Company, trade evidently made him rich. In 1615 he bought the Essex manors of Highams and Follifaunts for &pound;1680, and in 1630 he purchased the Oxfordshire manor of Bensington for &pound;386. Further acquisitions included the Middlesex manor of Ruislip, with a house at Pinner, and the lease of various tenements in Finsbury from the corporation of London, on which he may have spent as much as &pound;600 in making improvements. His London properties also included a town house in Leadenhall Street, for which he paid &pound;60 a year in rent. The house served as his normal residence&#151;it was where at least ten of his twelve children were born&#151;and from 1638 until his death it provided the venue for meetings of the board of directors of the East India Company at an annual fee of &pound;150. Income from rents, and the profits of commerce, enabled Clitherow to raise fairly substantial sums in cash. In 1640 he provided the king with &pound;500 as part of a larger City loan, while in the following spring he contributed &pound;1000 towards a second City loan to pay off the defeated English army in the north.<h2>
<a name="Politicallife"></a>Political life</h2>Clitherow's commercial success was reflected in the fact that he was often called on to hold office in the companies of which he was a member. Elected warden of the Ironmongers' Company in 1611, he became master in 1618 and again in 1624. In 1615&#150;16 he served as treasurer of the New Company of Merchant Adventurers. Perhaps his most prestigious appointments were in the East India Company, where he achieved office as deputy governor (1624) and governor (1638). He also served as governor of the hardly less significant Eastland Company (from at least 1632). James I considered him suitable to fill the post of treasurer of the Virginia Company in May 1622, despite the fact that he initially failed to contribute towards the Palatine benevolence, but though he stood for election he was trounced by Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton.<br>
<br>As a leading figure in the City, Clitherow was naturally involved in its government. At parish level he served as churchwarden of St Andrew Undershaft in 1612 and was one of the feoffees of the parish until at least 1617. He was a governor of Christ's Hospital by 1616, and was elected its president in 1637 after Sir Thomas Moulson declined to serve. A member of common council by 1623, he served as sheriff in 1625&#150;6 and was admitted to the aldermanic bench in 1626. His promising career in City government was seemingly placed in jeopardy in February 1628, when his opposition to the forced loan prompted London's citizens to elect him to parliament in preference to the corporation's nominees, even though he had never served as mayor and was not then of knightly status. However, his commercial interests made him an ideal spokesman for the City's diverse mercantile interests. He had grown particularly concerned at the ailing Danish war effort and the concomitant increase in imperial power in the Baltic, and when on 26 March the secretary of state, Sir John Coke, advanced a fourteen-point plan for military action to bolster the Danes, Clitherow, who was in communication with Coke over Baltic affairs, offered his warm support. In his maiden speech, delivered on 4 April, he drew on his own experience of the Eastland and Muscovy trades to argue that nothing &#145;more nearly concerns us &hellip; than &hellip; the King of Denmark and the defence of the Baltic sea&#146;  (Johnson and others, 2.305). Though his claim that English merchants would be &#145;altogether confined to our own country&#146;  (ibid.) were the Baltic to fall into the hands of the Holy Roman emperor was undoubtedly exaggerated, he correctly pointed out that maintaining access to the Baltic was vital for the continued supply of naval stores, such as pitch, tar, and cordage. It was therefore reasonable to suppose that, if the emperor succeeded in dominating the Baltic, &#145;he will master us all&#146;  (ibid., 2.300).<br>
<br>Perhaps Clitherow's most important speech to the house, because it touched on the interests and fears of every shipowning merchant and not just those trading to the Baltic, was delivered on 9 June. Speaking immediately after Moulson, his fellow member for London, Clitherow informed his listeners that &#145;I have been desired by the merchants of London to inform you of the miserable losses at sea&#146;  (Johnson and others, 4.200). He then proceeded to detail the loss of valuable shipping and cargoes to the Dunkirk privateers over the last few years, illustrating his case with the example of one vessel laden with masts worth &pound;80,000 which had been recently captured. Complaining that the merchant marine was afforded inadequate protection, he also observed that the navy served only to worsen the situation by its heavy demands for mariners and ships. In view of all these difficulties, he added, it was hardly surprising that &#145;all merchants are disheartened&#146;  (ibid., 4.201). Despite the importance of Clitherow's contribution to the trade debate, he appears to have been added to the committee appointed to prepare a schedule of lost shipping only as an afterthought. This schedule was included in the remonstrance submitted by the house to Charles I on 17 June, but Clitherow was aware that action rather than mere words would be needed if commerce was not to suffer further depredations, and he was therefore dismayed to learn that the king intended to prorogue parliament. In his final speech to the house, delivered on 24 June, he asserted that &#145;Now is the time to think on trade&#146;, and he warned that, if parliament went into recess, &#145;I fear not a decay only but an utter extirpation&#146;  (ibid., 4.456). Parliament was powerless to act, however, and the war with Spain was not brought to an end until 1630.<h2>
<a name="Mercantilematters"></a>Mercantile matters</h2>During the later 1620s and throughout the 1630s Clitherow and his fellow directors of the East India Company came under attack from a number of disgruntled shareholders for the losses sustained by the company. In the course of the 1628 parliament, Clitherow, who was the senior member of the company in the Commons, endeavoured to counter a petition presented by the aggrieved shareholders. He later proved a loyal ally of the governor, Sir Maurice Abbot, whom he replaced on the latter's resignation in 1638. He was appointed a royal commissioner in 1628 to collect the arrears owed by various City companies towards the cost of the Algiers expedition of 1620&#150;21, and was named a commissioner to raise contributions for the repair of St Paul's Cathedral in 1633. He served as lord mayor of London in 1635&#150;6, and was knighted during his term of office (15 January 1636). A leading member of London's &eacute;lite, he evidently entertained a low opinion of Charles I, and refused to admit one man to the Eastland Company despite the king's letter of recommendation. When the man's brother-in-law told Clitherow that Charles had promised to do the company a favour in return for the man's admission, Clitherow is said to have replied &#145;in an unseemly, slighting manner, that they all knew well enough what the king's good turns were when they came to seek them, or words to that effect&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637&#150;8</i>, 549&#150;50). In January 1641 Clitherow, as governor of the East India Company, was bullied by Charles into ordering the withdrawal of a petition to parliament complaining of the activities of one of his favourites, Endymion Porter, whose associates had allegedly committed acts of piracy in the Red Sea in 1630. Despite the obvious strain in relations between Clitherow and the king, the former may have shared the latter's conservative religious leanings, as a Paul's Cross sermon was dedicated to Clitherow while lord mayor by the Arminian preacher John Gore in 1635. Moreover, during the mid-1630s Clitherow's daughter Rachel married one of the king's chaplains, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21607/', "Dr William Paule")</script>, later bishop of Oxford. In 1668 the royalist writer David Lloyd recalled Clitherow as being &#145;a great stickler for the Church&#146;, and &#145;a great honourer of clergymen in the best of times, to whom some of his nearest relations were married in the worst&#146;. It has been suggested that Clitherow was &#145;probably part of a &hellip; London group of Arminian sympathisers&#146;  (Tyacke, 221) which included his brother-in-law and fellow aldermen Henry Garway and Anthony Abdy.<br>
<br>Clitherow drew up his will on 14 April 1640, died at his house in Pinner on 11 November 1641, and was buried seven days later at St Andrew Undershaft, where a monument was erected in his memory. Although he had at least seven sons, only his son James prevented the various branches of his family from becoming extinct in the male line. His daughter Judith married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70490/', "Thomas Cory (d. 1656)")</script>.<br>
