<span class="headword">Cole,  William</span>  (1635&#150;1716), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the son of a Church of England clergyman. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 9 December 1653, and by the late 1650s had become involved with the circle of researchers around Robert Boyle. Cole remained at Oxford until 1666, graduating BM from Gloucester Hall on 7 August 1660 and DM on 9 July 1666. While still at Oxford, about 1660, he married Jane (1638/9&#150;1724), whose maiden name is not known; their eldest surviving daughter, also named Jane, was born about 1662. A son, William, was born in 1667 or 1668; he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 12 March 1686, aged eighteen, but nothing more is known about him. A second surviving daughter, Ann, was born about 1670.<br>
<br>Upon graduation Cole moved to Worcester, where he practised as a physician. There he composed his first medical work, <span class="italic">De secretione animali cogitata</span>, published in Oxford in 1674. Secretion was a favourite topic among mechanically inclined physicians, and Cole's work reflected his training with Boyle and Thomas Willis. In his book he employed Willis's concepts of chemical fermentation and took for granted Boyle's notions of the weight and &#145;spring&#146; of the air. He also cited the work of Richard Lower, another Oxford mechanical philosopher.<br>
<br>Cole corresponded with Thomas Sydenham around 1680, agreeing with Sydenham's cooling regimen for smallpox. Cole did not know Sydenham personally, but both physicians were friends of John Locke. Cole's additional letter to Sydenham about hysteria elicited the latter's important essay on hypochondria and hysteria, the <span class="italic">Dissertatio epistolaris ad spectatissimum doctissimumq[ue] virum Gulielmum Cole, M.D.</span> (1682). After a brief discussion of smallpox Sydenham offered an interpretation of hypochondria in men and hysteria in women which defined them as essentially equivalent disorders.<br>
<br>In 1685 Cole published a few descriptions of clinical cases in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, but he was never made a fellow. His next major work (and his only medical work in English) was his <span class="italic">Physico-Medical Essay Concerning the Late Frequency of Apoplexies</span>, published in 1689, in which he attributed the apparent increase in apoplexy to the severely cold winter of 1683, explaining the effects of cold on this disorder. Cole also produced a work on natural history: <span class="italic">Purpura Anglicana, being a Discovery of a Shell-Fish Found on the Shores of the Severn</span> (1684).<br>
<br>Cole moved to London in the early 1690s. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 26 June 1693 and a fellow on 25 June 1694. In 1693 he was fined &pound;4 by the college (later remitted) for reading an anatomy lecture at Surgeons' Hall without leave. He published three works between 1693 and 1702, comprising a mechanistic explanation of the digestion, a treatise on fevers (in which he advocated the use of cinchona bark), and a description of a case of epilepsy. The latter, addressed to Dr Thomas Hobart of Cambridge, also included a discussion of insensible perspiration.<br>
<br>Cole was one of a number of physicians who embraced the mechanical philosophy in the 1650s and 1660s, and his published works are in the iatromechanical vein of other authors in the group around Boyle and Willis. His works enjoyed a certain amount of popularity, and his book on secretion was reprinted several times, including an Amsterdam edition in 1698. Cole was apparently a well-liked and successful practitioner, described as &#145;learned without ostentation, and polite without affectation&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>, 1.510).<br>
<br>Cole was named an elect of the Royal College of Physicians on 9 October 1712, but some time after that he appears to have retired to the country. He died on 12 June 1716, aged eighty-one, and was buried at the church of Allesley, near Coventry. His grave in the church includes a memorial inscription. His widow, who died in 1724 aged eighty-five, is buried beside him, as are two daughters.<br>
