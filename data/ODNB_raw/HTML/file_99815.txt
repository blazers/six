<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colledge,  (Magdalena) Cecilia</span>  (1920&#150;2008), <span class="occ">figure skater</span>, was born at 36 Belsize Grove, Hampstead, London, on 28 November 1920, the younger child of Lionel Colledge (1883&#150;1948), an ear, nose, and throat specialist, and his wife, Margaret Mary (1884&#150;1966), daughter of Admiral John Brackenbury. Her elder brother, Maule, a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, was shot down over Germany in 1943.<br>
<br>Cecilia and her mother attended the 1928 world figure skating championships, held in London, where Sonja Henie won the second of ten consecutive world titles. Cecilia was entranced by Henie's balletic skating and remarked, &#145;I should like to skate like that&#146;  (Hines, <span class="italic">Figure Skating</span>, 110). Encouraged by Gertrude Vinson, the mother of the American skater Maribel Vinson, Cecilia's mother arranged lessons for her. She was taught initially by the British ice dancers Eva Keats and Eric van der Weyden, a husband and wife couple who wrote an important book on skating and who invented four compulsory dances later employed in international competition. Mother and daughter went to Norway, the home of Henie, for coaching, but during a visit to see her brother, who attended school in Zuoz, Switzerland, they met Jacques Gerschwiler, one of three members of an important Swiss coaching family. Gerschwiler became Cecilia's coach, living initially in the Colledges' home, and remained her coach throughout her competitive career.<br>
<br>In 1932 both the Olympic winter games and the world figure skating championships were held in North America for the first time, the Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, on 4&#150;15 February and the world championships at Montreal, Quebec, on 19&#150;20 February. Fifteen ladies competed at Lake Placid, fourteen at Montreal, the largest number at that time for a world championship. Among them were four from Great Britain: Megan Taylor, Colledge, Mollie Phillips, and Joan Dix. They were placed seventh to tenth in that order at both competitions. For all of them these were their first international competitions. All except Phillips were aged eleven. Colledge was the youngest at eleven years and eighty-three days, a record for ladies at the world championships that still stood at the time of her death. Taylor was thirty-four days older.<br>
<br>Colledge and Taylor provided one of figure skating's great rivalries. At many competitions only one of them competed, but from 1931 to 1939 they competed against each other sixteen times, each beating the other eight times. On only four occasions were those placements not first and second. Six national competitions resulted in three titles each. At the Olympic trials in 1931 and the Olympic winter games in 1932 Taylor beat Colledge. At four European championships, Colledge beat Taylor every time, winning three titles (in 1937, 1938, and 1939). At the world championships Taylor was placed ahead of Colledge in 1932 and 1933, Colledge won the world title in 1937, the year after Henie's retirement from amateur competitions, and Taylor won in 1938. Their rivalry reached its peak in 1939. Colledge won her third consecutive European title with Taylor a close second, but Taylor was the reigning world champion. The anticipated showdown at the world championships did not occur. An injury kept Colledge out of the competition; Taylor easily won her second world title. It was the last competition before the Second World War, and neither skater competed internationally after the war, although Colledge won a sixth British title in 1946.<br>
<br>Colledge and Taylor were the most prominent skaters during a golden age for ladies' skating in Great Britain. Not since Madge Syers in 1906 and 1907 had there been a British world champion and there had been only a handful of medallists. After this remarkable period only Jeannette Altwegg claimed European, world, and Olympic titles for Britain (all in 1951&#150;2) during Colledge's lifetime. Colledge's cumulative record included six national titles, three European titles, and one world title.<br>
<br>After turning professional in 1946 Colledge skated in several shows, first an ice review at the Stoll Theatre in London, and later in shows at Brighton and at the Roxy Theater in New York. She moved to the United States in 1951 and taught skating for one season in Lake Placid, the site of her first Olympic effort nineteen years earlier. She then moved to Boston, where she taught at the Skating Club of Boston for forty-three years, retiring in 1995. Many of her students competed nationally and internationally, among them Lorraine Hanlon, and the ice dancers Sidney Foster and Franklin Nelson, and Judy Lamar and Ronald Ludington.<br>
<br>Colledge's place in figure skating history was sealed by a remarkable competitive record followed by her career as a respected coach, but also by several skating firsts. Most important was the parallel spin, later known as the camel spin, an invention of Colledge and her coach, Jacques Gerschwiler. Colledge was also the first skater to do a layback spin, later included in most ladies' programmes. In jumping Colledge was the first female competitor to do a two-revolution jump in competition, a double Salchow (included in her programme at the 1936 European championships). She also invented the one-foot Axel Paulsen jump, in which the landing is on an inside edge and on the same foot as the takeoff. Colledge was thus the inventor of more standard jumps and spins in figure skating than any other skater. She was a balanced skater with strong compulsory figures, which at that time accounted for 60 per cent of the score. Commenting on the elimination of compulsory figures from competition in 1990 she echoed the opinion of many coaches: &#145;I really liked figures and I think it's a terrible shame that they removed [them]. I think it has reduced the quality of skating&#146;  (Stevenson, 55).<br>
<br>Colledge was elected to the world figure skating hall of fame in 1980 and on her retirement from coaching in 1995 was named an honorary member of the Skating Club of Boston. Having lived latterly in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA, she died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 12 April 2008. She never married.<br>
