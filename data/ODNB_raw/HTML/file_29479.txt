<span class="headword">York,  William  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1256), <span class="occ">justice, and bishop of Salisbury</span>, apparently came from the East Riding of Yorkshire, though nothing is known of his parentage or early life. He may have begun his official career as a chancery clerk, perhaps under the patronage of Ralph de Neville, since, according to Matthew Paris, Henry III said of him in 1253 that he had once been a scribbler of royal writs, and some personal letters he wrote to Neville in 1226&#150;8, when the latter was chancellor, show Neville to have been his patron. More certainly, he served as a clerk of the bench from 1219, and probably from 1217; he may have been appointed by the chancellor for service in the bench, since he does not appear to have been the personal clerk of any of the justices. In the latter part of his period as a bench clerk one of his colleagues was his fellow East Riding man, Roger of Thirkleby, and another was William of Raleigh.<br>
<br>After gaining legal knowledge through his work as a clerk, York served from 1225 onwards as a commissioner of assize and special business in vacations, and in 1227&#150;8 was three times an eyre justice in the north. Some interesting and informative letters he wrote to Ralph de Neville at that time have survived. He first sat as a justice of the bench in 1231, shortly after he had ceased to serve as a clerk, and in 1234 became the most senior justice regularly sitting there after Robert of Lexinton, remaining in that appointment until the end of 1241, when he became senior justice in the court <i>coram rege</i> upon the death of Stephen of Segrave. He served on only six eyres as a junior justice, in 1227&#150;8 and 1232, while between 1234 and 1244 he served as chief justice on thirty-four eyres, from which six plea rolls survive which are probably his. His clerk, until 1246 and from perhaps as early as 1230, was Roger of Whitchester. During the king's absence in Gascony in 1242&#150;3 he played an important role in government, so much so that he was incorrectly believed by the annalist of Dunstable Priory to have been one of the regents.<br>
<br>York held a number of church appointments, the first known being the royal living of King's Ripton in Huntingdonshire, which he held by 1220, and which he managed to pass on to two of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s successively. He held several livings in Yorkshire, the most senior of which was the provostship of Beverley, and others in Lancashire, Northumberland, and Cambridgeshire. He also acquired canonries at York, St Paul's, London, and Wells. By the time of his promotion to the court <i>coram rege</i> it has been estimated that he held ecclesiastical appointments to a gross value of about &pound;800, according to valuations derived from the 1291 taxation of benefices by the pope, Nicholas IV. He eventually acquired lay interests, mostly leases or wardships, in several counties outside his native Yorkshire, including Surrey, Essex, Nottinghamshire, and Northamptonshire, as well as houses in London and York. As a cleric he had no direct heir, but before his death he conveyed his own estates in Eske, near Beverley, and Norton, near Malton, to his brother Sir Nicholas of York.<br>
<br>On 8 December 1246 York was elected bishop of Salisbury, and on receiving his temporalities in 1247 resigned as a justice, concentrating on his work as a bishop, although he still took part in judicial business at the greater sessions of the king's council, where he is known to have been involved in judgments against Dunstable Priory and the abbey of St Albans, and continued to witness royal charters when the king was at Winchester or in his own diocese; in 1251 he was brought out of judicial retirement to head an eyre for London. As bishop he was served as his personal official by Nicholas of York, perhaps a nephew, and was much concerned with the completion of the new cathedral at Salisbury, work which was probably assisted by his influence at court. He did not live to see its consecration. He died on 31 January 1256 and was buried in the choir of the cathedral. Matthew Paris's obituary of him was rather uncharitable, since he had given judgment against Matthew's abbey of St Albans. Nevertheless, Paris described him as &#145;most skilled in the laws of the kingdom&#146;  (Paris, 4.587), and his opinion was cited three times in the <span class="italic">De legibus</span> (formerly attributed to Bracton). He undoubtedly had great influence on the development of law and its administration, although all that Paris mentions is that he became unpopular through reinventing suit of court. He may well have been concerned in the extension and development of the articles of the eyre, and with the movement away from the issue of assize commissions to four, mainly local, justices to a single justice of one of the central courts, a move towards professionalization of justice in the localities.<br>
