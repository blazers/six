<span class="headword">Williams,  David</span>  (1900&#150;1978), <span class="occ">historian of Wales</span>, was born at Llan-y-cefn, north Pembrokeshire, on 9 February 1900, the younger son of David Williams, tenant farmer, and his wife Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morris. A Baptist, he came from a rural nonconformist background: he dedicated his <span class="italic">Rebecca Riots</span> to his forebears, &#145;sons and daughters of Rebecca&#146;. He was educated at Narberth grammar school and, after a brief period of war service in the army, at the University College, Cardiff. Here he obtained a first-class honours degree in history, along with a teacher's certificate (first class), and became a close friend of the economist and later Labour government minister Hilary Marquand. After leaving Cardiff, Williams taught history for three years at Tywyn intermediate school, Merioneth. However, he was anxious for a career in scholarship. In 1926 he gained a Rockefeller fellowship to France and Germany where he studied the political ideas first of Condorcet and then of Herder and worked under such scholars as Mathiez. Later he gained another Rockefeller fellowship to Columbia University in New York, where he obtained a master's degree. From 1928 to 1930 he taught at Barry Boys' County School. His pupils there, who included the historian H. J. Habakkuk, the economist Bryan Hopkin, and the archaeologist Glyn Daniel, testified to his inspirational qualities as a teacher; his cherubic appearance earned him the nickname Babyface. In 1930 he was to marry Irene Fothergill, a vivacious Cardiff girl and French scholar who became a university lecturer: their happy marriage was ended when she died young in 1942.<br>
<br>In 1930 Williams was appointed to a lectureship in history at the University College, Cardiff. Here, despite possibilities of moving to Oxford or even Australia, he was to serve for the next fifteen years. He was an academic polymath: a younger colleague like Christopher Hill was almost overawed by his scholarly range. He published important articles on political ideas during the French Revolution (particularly Rousseau), and on early American history, notably on the philosophy of Benjamin Franklin. For the rest of his life, the bust of Voltaire on his desk recalled this early passion. He lectured with authority, mainly on modern European history; his professor instructed him to dictate from notes. But his research specialism was Welsh political and social radicalism in the early nineteenth century. In 1939 he published a major monograph, <span class="italic">John Frost</span>, a pioneering study of the leader of the Newport Chartists a century earlier. It was more an analysis of the social upheavals in the industrial valleys in the 1830s than a study of Frost himself. Characteristically, he argued that the Newport rising had no revolutionary intent.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Williams briefly served in the Local Defence Volunteers, and then from 1941 to 1945 worked as manpower officer for the Ministry of Labour in south-east Wales. In 1945 he was appointed to the Sir John Williams chair of Welsh history at Aberystwyth; he was linked with the college there for the rest of his life. During this period he got married a second time, to Hilarie Margaret Waddington (<i>d</i>. 1996), a physiotherapist and lecturer in physical education. At Aberystwyth, Williams became a legendary figure. Master of scholarship and of gossip, he surveyed from his eyrie in the tower of Old College the human comedy of student and staff life in the little town, sometimes with the aid of marine binoculars. He also indulged his passion for classical music. In his youth he had a good tenor voice.<br>
<br>Williams now showed his wide range of historical interest. <span class="italic">Wales and America</span> (1946) and work on Welsh emigration was followed by studies of the Tudor dissenter John Penry, and in 1950 by an authoritative <span class="italic">History of Modern Wales</span>, for many years the standard work on the subject. But his main focus was on agrarian discontent and in 1955 this led to the publication of <span class="italic">The Rebecca Riots</span>, his historical masterpiece. The Rebecca riots were a remarkable series of attacks on the toll gates in south-west Wales by otherwise peaceful Welsh tenant farmers. Williams describes these events and their &#145;tarnished heroes&#146; with restraint and frequent irony. But his book is far more than this. It lays bare a countyside in crisis. Its innovative method recalls the French historians of the <span class="italic">Annales</span> school to whom this country-bred Welshman was intellectually closely related. Gently but powerfully, Williams examines the fractured society of south-west Wales and the gentry who led it, then the growth of radicalism through the newspapers and the chapels, then the riots and their aftermath. At one level it is a <i>pointilliste</i> study of local detail by a master of the miniature; but it is woven into a subtle analysis of complex social movements. It is a study of &#145;history from below&#146; ahead of its time. The conclusion has an inner strength. The toll gates went after all. The sons and daughters of Rebecca were triumphant. The book was universally acclaimed in the learned journals on both sides of the Atlantic. It might well have made him a fellow of the British Academy, but Williams was based in allegedly remote Aberystwyth, rather than Oxford or Cambridge. An unassuming man, he did not seem to mind.<br>
<br>Williams continued to be active across a wide range of modern Welsh history. A study of Chartism in Wales in 1959 was followed by an edition of John Penry's <span class="italic">Three Treatises Concerning Wales</span> (1960), and a <span class="italic">Tour de force</span> in a centenary evocation of Aberystwyth's second principal, <span class="italic">Thomas Francis Roberts</span> (1961), full of subtle asides and sly humour. He looked forward to a busy and creative retirement, working on the links between Welsh radicals and the French revolutionaries, notably his earlier namesake, David Williams. A Labour supporter, he regarded radical men and movements as grist to his mill. But it was not to be. In the early sixties, he showed signs of being afflicted by Parkinson's disease. Soon he was little more than an invalid, although he managed to attend a presentation dinner in Cardiff to receive a Festschrift on his retirement as professor in 1967. In his latter years, he depended heavily on the devoted nursing of his wife. He died at his home, 2 Laura Place, Aberystwyth, on 24 February 1978, and was cremated.<br>
<br>David Williams was arguably the most influential historian of modern Wales that the nation has produced. A quiet, reserved man, neatly dressed in a grey suit and a Homburg hat, slow in gait as he progressed sedately along the Aberystwyth promenade, he was a man of great intellectual force. His technical mastery of his materials was complete, but it was allied to other powerful qualities&#151;a limpid literary style, an insatiable curiosity for detail mingled with what Richard Cobb called his &#145;tiny gentle claw of malice&#146;  (Cobb, 205), an instinctive rationalism which sought to deflate sentimental legends, but also an inner passion for the common people which emerged, with typical restraint, in the concluding pages of <span class="italic">The Rebecca Riots</span>. A physical characteristic was a tic in his left eye that would become noticeable as he recalled some picturesque or scandalous historical detail. He was a powerful influence upon other historians, colleagues at Aberystwyth such as Richard Cobb and Gwyn A. Williams, and on a new generation of younger Welsh historians. They found that, beneath the placid, even cold, veneer, there was a warm human being. He taught them their craft but also encouraged them never to be in awe of the past. The awareness of the plural, multicultural nature of British historical experience in the later twentieth century, shown by the upsurge in the history of modern Wales, owes as much to David Williams as to any other person.<br>
