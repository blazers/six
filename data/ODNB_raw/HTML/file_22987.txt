<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  John Netten</span>  (1826&#150;1884), <span class="occ">epidemiologist and public health activist</span>, was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 20 April 1826, and was baptized at the Red Lion Street Methodist Chapel in Boston. He was the son of Charles Radcliffe, Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Rose, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22976/', "Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822&#150;1889)")</script>. Educated at the Leeds school of medicine, he gained a diploma and immediately undertook service in the Crimea as a surgeon attached to the headquarters of Omar Pasha. This proved a decisive experience. Although after returning from the war he was appointed medical superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic in Queen Square, London, Radcliffe had already developed an intense interest in &#145;exotic&#146; diseases. Each of the classic research papers and reports that he wrote between the early 1860s and the late 1870s described the manner in which infections are spread from their &#145;natural&#146; habitats to environments in which they sustain an &#145;artificial&#146; and hence potentially eradicable existence.<br>
<br>Elected to membership of the Epidemiological Society of London at the age of twenty-four, Radcliffe served as honorary secretary from 1862 to 1871 and president from 1875 to 1877. Here he met John Simon, who was at that time eager to recruit young medical men and epidemiologists to undertake studies for the medical office of the privy council. Radcliffe was appointed a public health inspector in 1869 and assistant medical officer at the Local Government Board in 1871. On 5 July 1870, at the mature age of forty-four, he married Anne Martha Billing, daughter of John Turner Billing, a London solicitor; they had three sons and four daughters. Radcliffe shunned major administrative responsibilities, preferring to concentrate on the temporal and spatial minutiae of the disease process. Simon described him as a perfectionist who immersed himself in the &#145;time, place and dynamics of &hellip; epidemic and endemic disease&#146;, and displayed &#145;the familiar knowledge which a Charing-cross policeman is supposed to have of the ominibuses which pass his beat&#146;. A reticent man, Radcliffe possessed &#145;a somewhat unpunctuated and unaccentuated mode of speech&#146; and a &#145;frequent preference for semi-sarcastic (though never ill intended) forms of expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 562&#150;3). Overwork was said to have played a role in triggering the terminal neurological illness which forced him to resign from the Local Government Board in 1879.<br>
<br>Adding empirical substantiation to the theoretical insights associated with the discoveries of John Snow and William Budd, Radcliffe's research into cholera, typhoid, water supply, and the disposal of sewage convinced large numbers of public health activists during the 1860s and 1870s that infection was unlikely to be exclusively propagated by a foul atmosphere, climatic variation, or the condition of the soil. His work on the diffusion of cholera in the Mediterranean region in 1865 was complemented by a scathing attack on the East London River Company, in &#145;On cholera in London&#146; (1867), which, together with an equally damning investigation by William Farr and Edward Frankland, confirmed that failure to maintain consistent waterworks procedures had led to traumatic mortality from the pandemic infection in the poorest districts of the capital. Three years later Radcliffe returned to the fray and argued, in &#145;On the turbidity of water&#146; (1870), that the private London water companies had failed to regulate themselves or conform to minimal safety requirements. Insisting that choice of raw river water and the state of filtering equipment must now be subject to rigorous scientific control, Radcliffe canvassed public ownership of London's water supply system.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was equally radical in his attitude towards the monitoring of milk. In 1873, in collaboration with W. H. Power, he produced a masterly analysis of a large-scale outbreak of enteric fever in Marylebone. Noting that incidence and mortality were heavily concentrated among the well-to-do, Radcliffe and Power excluded both miasmatic processes and the pollution of local water supplies. Discovering that &#145;nursery milk&#146; had been &#145;collected from three or four cows selected and set apart from the general herd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1874, 31), the two epidemiologists located the origins of the outbreak deep in the Buckinghamshire countryside, and thereby drew public attention in their &#145;Report on an outbreak of enteric fever&#146; (1874) to the central role played by tainted water in small and remote dairies.<br>
<br>Returning in the same year to an earlier preoccupation, Radcliffe visited nearly fifty communities to evaluate the rival claims of the midden, pail, water, earth, and charcoal systems of excrement disposal. Rejecting Edwin Chadwick's obsession with the water closet, Radcliffe nevertheless urged public authorities to ensure that the appliance should be made as readily available to the working as to the middle classes. As his health began to fail, Radcliffe also worked long and hard on papers on hospital hygiene and measures to be taken to prevent any possibility of a recrudescence of bubonic plague in north-western Europe.<br>
<br>Together with William Farr and Edward Frankland, Radcliffe successfully combined the roles of disinterested scientist and social critic. Convinced of the frailty of explanations of disease behaviour which depended on non-quantifiable variations in atmospheric and meteorological conditions, he was converted early in his career to the idea that individual infections were transmitted by specific and potentially detectable &#145;germs&#146;. However, the precise chemical and, or, biological components of these entities, and their mode of reproduction in the environment, defied explanation. Thus Radcliffe drew on an increasingly reliable body of data collected by local medical officers of health and sought through exclusion and controlled statistical observation to infer the presence of the germs associated with cholera, typhoid, and gastroenteritis. Radcliffe and William Farr's ideal&#151;a standardized procedure to predict future outbreaks of disease through detailed knowledge of previous episodes&#151;remained theoretically and empirically unattainable. But during the interregnum which separated the supremacy of the atmospheric theory and the application of new bacteriological insights in the 1880s and 1890s, Radcliffe's methodology was central to a redefinition of epidemiological practice and the environmental processes with which it was concerned.<br>
<br>Radcliffe died of &#145;chronic cerebritis&#146; on 11 September 1884 at 43 Fitzroy Road, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
