<span class="headword">Reed,  William Henry <span class="st"> [Billy]</span></span>  (1876&#150;1942), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born on 29 July 1875 at Christ Church Street, Frome, Somerset, the son of Francis John Reed, an Inland Revenue officer, and his wife, Emma Mary Warren. He was educated privately, and studied the violin with Emile Sauret and composition with Ebenezer Prout at the Royal Academy of Music. On 9 April 1902 he married Harriet Eveline (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), daughter of Arthur Dreyfus, a broker. Reed joined the Queen's Hall Orchestra, and when the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) was formed in 1904 he was one of many players who left to join the new orchestra, under its principal conductor Hans Richter. In 1912 he became leader, a position he held until 1935. With Arthur Nikisch as conductor, the LSO was the first British orchestra to visit the United States and Canada. When Reed resigned as leader in 1935 he was invited to become chairman of the LSO board.<br>
<br>Reed was associated with the Three Choirs festival from 1902, when he first played in the orchestra; in 1910 he became leader of the Festival Orchestra, continuing to lead it until 1938, the last festival before the war. Through the festival he became a close friend of Sir Edward Elgar, and when Elgar was working on his violin concerto, op. 61, in 1910, he called on Reed to help with the arrangement of the passage work, the bowings, and the fingerings, and to play new passages as he wrote them, so that he could get them down exactly as he wished them to be played. In August 1910 Reed was asked by Elgar to play the whole concerto to a group of friends before the Gloucester festival, with the composer at the piano, and when the concerto had its first public performance in November 1910 with Fritz Kreisler as the soloist, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Reed played in the orchestra. After the composer's death, Reed published an article, &#145;Elgar's violin concerto&#146;, in <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span> (16, 1935). As an indication of his friendship, in 1914 Elgar dedicated <span class="italic">Sospiri</span>, op. 70, for strings, harp, and organ, to &#145;W. H. Reed&#146;. Elgar continued to seek Reed's help when writing violin music, and in 1918 Reed helped with the violin sonata, op. 82, and gave its first public performance with Landon Ronald at the Aeolian Hall. As second violin of the British String Quartet he took part in the first performances of Elgar's string quartet, op. 83, and piano quintet, op. 84, in 1919, and he was a member of the string quartet that played at the funeral of Alice, Lady Elgar, on 10 April 1920. Reed also took part in the recording of some of Elgar's works, including the first recordings of <span class="italic">Falstaff</span> (op. 68) in 1929, and the <span class="italic">Nursery Suite</span>, in both of which he played the solo violin part with the LSO. After the BBC commissioned Elgar to write a third symphony in 1932, he worked closely with Reed until his own final illness, when he asked Reed, a few months before his death in 1934, to promise not to let anyone &#145;tinker&#146; with the unfinished symphony after his death. Despite this, and despite the assurances given by the BBC to Elgar's daughter, who had handed the manuscripts over to the BBC for safe keeping, that none of them would be published in whole or in part, Reed reproduced forty pages of the sketches for the symphony in facsimile, together with a detailed commentary based on his discussions with the composer, in <span class="italic">Elgar as I Knew Him</span> (1936). On the basis of these the symphony was reconstructed and completed by Anthony Payne in 1997 to great acclaim. Reed also wrote a biography of Elgar in the <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> series, which was published in 1939.<br>
<br>Reed was a prolific composer himself, and many of his orchestral works were first performed at the Three Choirs Festival from 1904 onwards, when his orchestral fantasia, <span class="italic">Scenes from the Ballet</span>, was played at the Gloucester festival. His most popular works were <span class="italic">Will o' the Wisp</span> (Gloucester 1913), <span class="italic">Lincoln Imp</span> (Hereford 1921), and <span class="italic">Aesop's Fables</span> (Hereford 1924), and other works included the scherzo fantastique <span class="italic">Caliban</span> (Gloucester 1907), <span class="italic">Variations for Strings</span> (Worcester 1911), the rhapsody for viola and orchestra (Hereford 1927), the <span class="italic">Symphony for Strings</span> (Gloucester 1934), and the overture <span class="italic">Merry Andrew</span> (composed for the cancelled 1939 festival and first performed at Hereford in 1946). Reed taught the violin at the Royal College of Music, where he had many devoted pupils. He also conducted several amateur orchestras, including the Croydon Symphony Orchestra, which he helped to found in 1920 as the Croydon String Players Club, and when the Croydon Philharmonic Society organized an Elgar festival in 1935 Reed performed the violin concerto.<br>
<br>In 1939 the archbishop of Canterbury conferred on Reed the honorary degree of MusD. Reed died of heart failure on 2 July 1942 at St Joseph's College, Dumfries, while examining candidates for the Associated Board. The strings of the London Symphony Orchestra played at his memorial service in Croydon parish church on 18 July 1942, and his ashes were buried in Worcester Cathedral, near the Elgar memorial window, on 15 October 1942.<br>
