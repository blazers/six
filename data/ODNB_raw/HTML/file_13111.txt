<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hervey,  Frederick Augustus</span>, fourth earl of Bristol  (1730&#150;1803), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Derry</span>, was born at Ickworth House, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 1 August 1730, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13116/', "John Hervey, Baron Hervey of Ickworth (1696&#150;1743)")</script>, courtier and writer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13118/', "Mary Hervey, Lady Hervey (1699/1700&#150;1768)")</script>, courtier and wit, the daughter of Brigadier-General Nicholas Lepell and Mary Brooke. The manor of Ickworth had been in Hervey's family since the fifteenth century, but the earldom of Bristol came to him in 1779, from his grandfather John Hervey (1665&#150;1751), a noted politician who received the title in 1714. Hervey's father had briefly been lord privy seal but his political career was cut short by his death. Despite the continuing presence of his distinguished grandfather it is believed that Hervey's mother was the principal influence that shaped his character and those of his seven siblings. He received a conventional education, first at Dr Newcome's private school in Hackney, and later at Westminster School. There he was taught by the Latinist Vincent Bourne, in the company of William Cowper, Charles Churchill, and William Hamilton. After seven years at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, he graduated MA, as a nobleman, in 1754. During this period, and in the face of joint family opposition, he formed a love match with Elizabeth Davers (1732/3&#150;1800), whom he married on 10 August 1752; she was one of the legitimate children of the tory Sir Jermyn Davers, of Rushbrook Hall, Suffolk, and his wife, his former long-term mistress Margaretta Green. Hervey, as a third son, had a small fortune; even so his wife's unpopularity with his family was not offset by her dowry of &pound;3000. They had three daughters and four sons; their middle daughter was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4930/', "Elizabeth Christiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire")</script>.<br>
<br>Following a failed attempt to secure a parliamentary seat for his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13109/', "Augustus John Hervey")</script>, later third earl, with whom he was to remain on bad terms, Hervey abandoned an intended career in law and took holy orders. He was ordained deacon on 24 August 1754 and priest on 26 January 1755. His family background enabled him to proceed smoothly to a clerkship of the privy seal in 1756 and to a royal chaplaincy in 1763. He had sufficient leisure to undertake the first of several tours of the continent in 1765&#150;6, during which he travelled to Brussels, Geneva, Naples, Rome, and Florence. A visit to Vesuvius with William Hamilton when a minor eruption was in progress led to a lifelong interest in geology, even though he was hit by a hot volcanic rock and had to recuperate for a few weeks. He travelled on to Corsica, where he met General Pasquale Paoli, and returned to England via the Veneto and Switzerland. He was deeply affected by the death of his eldest son, George, who died in Spa, aged nine.<br>
<br>Despite its element of prestige Hervey's chaplaincy to George III was a post of poor emolument, and as his family grew so did his financial difficulties. A point of peculiar irritation was the continual failure of his brother-in-law Sir Robert Davers, a man dogged by family tragedies and suicides, to meet the terms of Hervey's marriage settlement. The situation improved dramatically, if briefly, when Hervey's eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13112/', "George William Hervey, second earl of Bristol")</script>, accepted the lord lieutenancy of Ireland in August 1766 and appointed Hervey his first chaplain. It was Hervey's first contact with Ireland.<br>
<br>Lord Bristol held the Irish viceroyalty for less than a year, and never visited the country. But short as his tenure was it was sufficient to put his brother's foot on the lucrative ladder of Irish preferment. Hervey was given the bishopric of Cloyne, which he held for nine months while he and his brother waited for the death of Dr William Barnard, bishop of Derry, whose position was worth at least &pound;7000 a year. Barnard in fact outlived Bristol's term of office but the subsequent Irish viceroy approved the appointment, and Hervey succeeded to the see of Derry in February 1768. Two days earlier the degree of doctor of divinity had been conferred on him by Trinity College, Dublin. In 1770 a second such doctorate was conferred on him by Oxford University.<br>
<br>While Hervey's passion for politics clearly was inherited from his father's side of the family it is believed that his lifelong interest in religion was kindled by his mother. His early contacts with Irish Roman Catholic leaders indicate that his views on the issue of relief from the penal laws were well developed, as he explained to an unnamed Catholic in October 1767: &#145;My object is to leave you your faith entire but to secure your allegiance to the present government and to make you independent of all foreign jurisdiction whatever&#146;  (Walsh, 12). At this time the Catholic Committee, a patrician-led body that represented Irish Roman Catholic interests, was struggling to formulate an oath of allegiance that, it was hoped, would be acceptable both to the government and to the Catholic clergy and laity. Hervey's sympathetic attitude toward Catholics, and his powerful family connections, made him an attractive intermediary, and he was soon in close consultation with the Catholic Committee.<br>
<br>On his second European tour (April 1770&#150;October 1772), Hervey had at least one audience with Pope Clement XIV, visited Irish Catholic seminaries in France, and took soundings on the suitability of a Catholic oath of allegiance. He formulated an oath that not merely contained a statement of allegiance to the government but also attempted to address the most common protestant fears. It required from Catholics detailed denials of the pope's infallibility, his avowed temporal supremacy, and his supposed power to absolve subjects from their allegiance to &#145;heretic&#146; kings; the Stuart pretender and his heirs were likewise to be repudiated. Hervey communicated his proposal to protestant as well as Catholic parties, but his over-strenuous efforts to persuade protestants to sanction the oath have damaged his historical reputation. He sought to win protestant support by suggesting that his oath was deliberately calculated to divide Catholics and so strengthen the protestant interest. Despite support from the Catholic gentry for his endeavours Hervey's protestant correspondents, both lay and ecclesiastical, were either opposed to his proposals or pessimistic of his chances of success. The papal internuncio wrote from Brussels to the Irish Catholic bishops, condemning the oath with its denials of papal powers. The hierarchy, fearful of the effects of their own internal disagreements on these issues and even more fearful of the effect of the internuncio's views on the government, suppressed the letter while they made vain attempts to work out with the internuncio some alternative course of action. To the consternation of his colleagues one of the bishops who was opposed to Hervey's oath eventually (in 1772) published the internuncio's letter. Despite these developments the supporters of the oath continued to press the issue until the substance of Hervey's oath was embodied in a piece of legislation in 1774. The divisions among both bishops and laity on the issue now became stark and obvious, and the Catholic Committee became split between jurors, who were prepared to take the oath, and nonjurors, who were not; as a result the committee collapsed.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the disastrous effects of his involvement on the Catholic community Hervey continued to play off one side of the Irish sectarian divide against the other for the rest of the decade. To a prominent protestant politician he suggested that recognition should be extended to all jurors, that Catholic bishops and clergymen should be state-appointed, and that the (still illegal) religious orders should be allowed monasteries and that these should be run as seminaries with state funding. Hervey was aware that these ideas, if put into practice, would lead to further divisions among Catholics but he felt that such divisions could only be of value to the establishment in view of the approaching war with France.<br>
<br>Hervey chose to detach himself from Irish politics in the late 1770s. In 1777 he set out on his third trip to Italy, this time accompanied by his wife and youngest daughter, Louisa (1767&#150;1821), the future wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14740/', "Robert Banks Jenkinson, second earl of Liverpool")</script>. By November 1777 he had settled in Rome, where he indulged his passion for art and architecture. On this and on his three subsequent visits to Italy he cultivated a taste for Roman antiquities and early Italian Renaissance paintings but he also commissioned works from many contemporary artists, including portraits of himself and his family by Pompeo Batoni, Wilhelm Tischbein, Anton Maron, Elizabeth Vigee Le Brun, and Angelica Kauffmann. As he wrote to his eldest daughter, Mary: &#145;I cannot resist the temptation of being extravagant here especially when it is with a view of beautifying dear Ireland&#146;  (Fothergill, 53). His purchases were destined for the house at Downhill, in co. Londonderry, that was built in 1776&#150;9 by Michael Shanahan. Hervey, however, often proved a troublesome patron; John Soane, for instance, had a wasted journey to Downhill when the promised commission for a new dining-room failed to materialize.<br>
<br>Hervey's fickleness contributed to his reputation for eccentricity. His extravagant dress invited both comment and ridicule; he attended the Sistine Chapel on Maundy Thursday 1779 in full canonical dress, and had a penchant for puce and golden robes. The painter Thomas Jones described how Hervey adorned himself at his levee: &#145;I found him combing and adjusting a single curl which was fixed to his own short hair&#146;  (Fothergill, 65). His singular appearance was matched by his unconventional religious beliefs. Though Emma Hamilton's statement that he was &#145;an avowed sceptic in religion&#146;  (ibid., 37) is probably an exaggeration, he seems to have been a freethinker, and he courted the friendship of Voltaire, whom he visited at Ferney. He shocked polite company by swearing freely in public and on one occasion made fools of the candidates for a wealthy living in his diocese by making them race each other after they had feasted at his table.<br>
<br>In December 1779 Hervey's elder brother, Augustus John Hervey, died, and he succeeded as fourth earl of Bristol, acquiring estates with an annual rental value of &pound;20,000 and thereby doubling his income. Without obvious cause he and his wife separated in 1782, never to be reconciled. Perhaps to divert himself the Earl-Bishop, as he was known, left his inherited estate of Ickworth, in Suffolk, and returned to Londonderry, where he became a committed volunteer commander. His volunteers were among the many Irish who realized the necessity to copperfasten the legislative independence secured in 1782 with a measure of parliamentary reform. In the northern Irish counties, where volunteering was at its most articulate, informed, and enthusiastic, the issue of parliamentary reform became inextricably linked with the liberation of Catholics from the political as well as the social and economic strictures of the penal laws. As colonel of the Londonderry corps Bristol joined together with 500 Ulster corps delegates who met in Dungannon in 1783 to plan a grand general convention of volunteers for Dublin in November. At this convention it was intended to press the government to reform the allegedly corrupt Irish legislature.<br>
<br>But despite their frequent parliamentary stance in opposition to government the aristocratic colonels of the other volunteer corps were closely wedded to the protestant establishment, and were concerned to exercise control over their armed followers and to redirect or contain their more radical aspirations. Notwithstanding Bristol's high-profile triumphal procession from Londonderry to Dublin in November 1783, a journey interrupted by several civic receptions, care was taken once he reached Dublin that he was not elected president of the convention. In the event parliamentary reform, a multi-faceted issue, was subordinated to the sectarian concerns of the Irish establishment and to the morbid fears of individual protestant delegates. The powerful parliamentary orator Henry Flood, on whose support Bristol had counted heavily, baulked at the proposal to enfranchise Catholics. An address from the revived Catholic Committee, embodying their wishes for further relief concessions, blunted itself against the government's determination to divide and confuse the delegates. A letter, allegedly from one of the leading Catholic gentry, was produced by a government supporter and asserted the satisfaction of Catholics with their current lot. Bristol's uncertain temper let him down more than once during the convention, and the majority of the delegates, like Flood, were unable to swallow the proposal to extend the vote to Catholics; such Catholics, it was feared, might then fill the Irish parliament to the exclusion of protestants. The delegates eventually produced a reform bill that was vague in regard to detail and pro-protestant in character. The Irish House of Commons rejected it by a large majority, and the convention dissolved itself.<br>
<br>The end of the American War of Independence and the renewed confidence that the return of a reasonably-sized army lent to the government had played a part in the contemptuous rejection of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. The government now also felt able to discourage volunteering. In the event, however, having lost much of its political <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, volunteering went into a steady voluntary decline. Bristol, bitter beyond words at the failure of all his political ambitions, retreated further into eccentricity and nihilism. His intemperate replies to the many addresses presented to him by volunteer corps in the aftermath of the convention attracted the attention of the government, but he escaped impeachment. A close official eye was kept on him for as long as he remained in Ireland, but the government refused to be provoked by his extravagant utterances. It is said that Bristol preferred his retreat at Downhill to his English home at Ickworth. Built on a windswept clifftop it had two main entrances, north and south, so that guests might avoid the worst of the gales. For Ickworth he had many grandiose plans, which, due to his travels and divided attentions, were never completed. He commissioned Francis Sandys, an Irish architect, to build a large oval rotunda with quadrant wings, and work began in 1796; it succeeded, then as now, more as a storehouse of art treasures than as a comfortable residence. Throughout his life Bristol was moved to design and build houses in which he was destined never or seldom to live. He spent only a matter of weeks in his newly built house at Ballyscullian, co. Londonderry, in 1790&#150;91, after which it was left empty; visitors rated it as more splendid and more pleasingly designed even than Downhill. These projects did, however, provide much-needed local employment. His determination to leave his mark on the landscape in the form of bricks and mortar was visible also during his early enthusiastic years as bishop of Derry, when as part of an assiduous visitation exercise he insisted on the building of glebe houses.<br>
<br>Bristol's health began to fail, and he left for Europe again in 1785. His visits to Ireland thereafter were increasingly short, and throughout the 1790s he travelled without purpose. His increasingly outrageous behaviour and his long absence from his diocese began to cause concern. The early days of his incumbency&#151;when his personal charity had been a byword, when he had encouraged improved farming techniques, when he had received the approbation of John Wesley, and when he had supported financially not only his own church but those of his Catholic and Presbyterian neighbours&#151;had become a distant memory. He spent the last nine years of his life abroad, and became an intimate of Emma Hamilton and a dabbler in the affairs of the Prussian court. His reaction to the death of his estranged wife, on 19 December 1800, was characterized by its coldness and indifference; he was heard to comment scathingly on her will. While on the road from Albano to Rome on 8 July 1803 Bristol was seized with a stomach complaint and died. His body was sent to England for burial at Ickworth Park.<br>
