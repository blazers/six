<span class="headword">Davidson,  Thomas</span>  (1817&#150;1885), <span class="occ">natural history artist and palaeontologist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 17 May 1817, the eldest of the three children of William Davidson, the wealthy owner of Muirhouse and other Midlothian estates, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Alexander Horsebrugh of Peeblesshire. From the age of six he was educated in France, Italy, and Switzerland, developing a natural artistic talent as well as a strong interest in natural history. His inclination for the fine arts was encouraged by attending classes in Paris, and then as a pupil of Paul Delaroche and Horace Vernet. Access to the lectures of leading scientists at the major French institutions also widened Davidson's understanding of natural history. From 1832, under the guidance of Constant Pr&eacute;vost, he concentrated on geology and palaeontology, returning to Scotland briefly in 1835&#150;6 to study at Edinburgh University, then carrying out further fieldwork on the continent from 1836. After meeting Leopold von Buch during 1837 he was persuaded to undertake a comprehensive study of both living and fossil Brachiopoda. While studying in France Davidson met Caroline Charlotte Pittar, daughter of Isaac Pittar, of East Brixton, Surrey; there followed a distant and hesitant, but constant, courtship. Once they were engaged Davidson could no longer endure their frequent separations and within a few months they were married, on 29 November 1841. Shortly afterwards they went to Rome, where Davidson concentrated on art.<br>
<br>An adequate private income allowed Davidson to devote his life to brachiopod research. In describing the wealth of British fossil taxa his artistic talent assisted him in the illustration of their distinctive features, and his genuine enthusiasm encouraged many British palaeontologists to assist him in building up an extensive research collection. His great knowledge of the phylum resulted in numerous publications. The Palaeontographical Society monograph on <span class="roman">British Fossil Brachiopoda</span> became his <i>magnum opus</i>; the first part was issued in 1851 and, with successive parts published over the next thirty-five years, formed six volumes containing 2280 pages and 234 lithographed plates of his drawings; the last part, <span class="italic">A Bibliography of the Brachiopoda</span> (1886) was only completed in 1884. He also published a description of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition material (1880), and started a monograph on the Recent species.<br>
<br>The substance of Davidson's classification of the Brachiopoda has endured and confirms his thorough understanding of that phylum. His diary records his enormous capacity for work; his research on Elizabeth Gray's collection of Girvan Brachiopoda began on 11 February 1882 and was completed by 22 May, during which he distinguished 118 species. Professor Lapworth considered that the resulting &#145;table of Girvan brachiopods was the most useful piece of work&#146; he had encountered (see T. Davidson, letter-book 27, NHM). Others subsequently acknowledged Davidson's devotion and energy as he persevered with this research throughout his life, and fellow workers later maintained that he had left very little for future students to accomplish. On his death he was considered to have been one of the most single-minded naturalists of the century.<br>
<br>Davidson's role and scientific achievements were widely acknowledged during his lifetime. He was elected FRS in 1857 and made the first honorary member of the Geological Society of Glasgow in 1858. He served on the council of the Geological Society of London in 1858&#150;60 and as its secretary in 1858&#150;9. He was awarded that society's Wollaston medal in 1865; a &#145;Silurian medal&#146; by Murchison in 1868; and one of the gold medals of the Royal Society in 1870. In 1880 he was the British representative at the fiftieth anniversary meeting of the French Geological Society, and he was awarded an honorary LLD by St Andrews University in 1882.<br>
<br>After moving to Brighton at the end of 1856, Davidson was involved in the foundation of the &#145;free&#146; library and museum, becoming chairman of the museum committee until his death. He died at his home, 9 Salisbury Road, Brighton, on 14 October 1885 following a long illness. He left several virtually completed manuscripts that were published posthumously over the next three years. His library, collections, and manuscript notebooks were bequeathed to the British Museum (Natural History), London.<br>
