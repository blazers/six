<span class="headword">Kennaway, Sir  John Henry</span>, third baronet  (1837&#150;1919), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Park Crescent, London, on 6 June 1837, eldest son and heir of Sir John Kennaway, second baronet (1797&#150;1873), and his wife, Emily Frances (<i>d</i>. 1858), second daughter of Thomas Kingscote. He was educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took first-class honours in the law and modern history school (1860). He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple (1864) and for a time practised on the western circuit. He travelled widely, in Greece, the Crimea, Palestine, and the United States. His American travels after the civil war led him to write <span class="italic">On Sherman's Track</span>, an account of the southern states published in 1866. He married on 27 November 1866 Frances (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Archibald Francis Arbuthnot and granddaughter of Field Marshal Viscount Gough.<br>
<br>Kennaway succeeded to the baronetcy and the family seat, Escot, near Honiton, Devon, in 1873, having become Conservative MP for East Devon at an unopposed by-election in 1870. He sat continuously until 1910, representing the Honiton division of Devon after 1884. When he was opposed by a Liberal candidate at general elections in 1880, 1885, and 1892, he won by large majorities, but in the last election in which he stood, in 1906, his majority over his Liberal opponent was considerably reduced. From 1908 to 1910 he was father of the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Kennaway held strong low-church views and his parliamentary activities were primarily devoted to upholding them. The subjects on which he spoke included education, church discipline, temperance, and missionary work. He was president of the Church Missionary Society and the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. He was also linked with the Church Association, an organization dedicated to opposing Romanizing tendencies in Anglican services. Although his interventions in the house were neither frequent nor extensive, his length of service and loyalty to his party gave him authority. His evangelical views never made him intolerant towards high-churchmen in his own party nor to the nonconformists on the benches opposite. Speaking on the controversial <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Bill</span> of 1874, he rejoiced that nonconformists were able to attend Anglican services, but thought it unfair that they should be able to start litigation against Anglican clergymen. He had little sympathy with strident attempts to control ritualism by legislation: thus on a <span class="roman">Church Discipline Bill</span> moved from the Liberal benches in 1899 he supported the government position of continuing to maintain the bishops' veto on the initiation of judicial proceedings.<br>
<br>On education Kennaway was a strong upholder of denominationalism and defender of the Church of England's work in establishing schools. When in 1906 he offered measured and defensive opposition to the Liberal government's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> he was able to remind the house of his experience, reaching back to Forster's act of 1870. When in one of his last speeches, in 1909, he defended the Anglican establishment in Wales he recalled to his audience that he had entered the house immediately after the disestablishment of the Irish church, but that Gladstone had then refused to adopt the same policy for Wales. Among his work for temperance there was an attempt in 1877 to move, jointly with Joseph Chamberlain, a resolution enabling borough councils compulsorily to acquire retail liquor licences, a proposal similar to the well-known G&ouml;teborg system. He asked frequent questions on missionary work, especially in Uganda. He had erected, in Escot church, a monument to Lieutenant Shergold Smith, sent to Uganda in 1876 in response to Stanley and killed there.<br>
<br>Kennaway's position as a loyal back-bencher with distinct views but no obvious ministerial ambitions was well appreciated by Salisbury, who offered him a peerage. He preferred to remain in the Commons, however, and was sworn of the privy council in 1897. He was made a Companion in the Order of the Bath in 1902. He was a man of commanding presence and outspoken views, well known in his county of Devon, where he owned over 4000 acres. He was an officer in the Devonshire regiment of volunteers for forty-two years and commanded his battalion from 1896 to 1902. Kennaway died at Escot on 6 September 1919 and was buried five days later. He was survived by his wife, their son, who succeeded to the baronetcy, and two daughters, the second of whom, Joyce Christabel, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36893/', "Sir Philip Wilbraham Baker-Wilbraham")</script>.<br>
