<span class="headword">McBurney,  Charles Brian Montagu</span>  (1914&#150;1979), <span class="occ">prehistoric archaeologist</span>, was born on 18 June 1914 at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, USA, the only son of Henry McBurney (1875&#150;1956), engineer and farmer, and his wife Dorothy Lilian Rundall (<i>d</i>. 1958), daughter of Colonel Montagu Rundall and his wife, Margaret Willoughby Weston. His father was American and his mother English. Charles was the younger of two children, having an elder sister. His early life was divided between the family farm in Massachusetts and western Europe, where his parents, nervous of the fact that he suffered from colitis, arranged private education by a succession of tutors, mainly in Switzerland. He settled permanently in England in 1930, not however becoming a British citizen until 1950.<br>
<br>In 1933 McBurney entered King's College, Cambridge, as an undergraduate, recommended by one of his former tutors: he initially read modern languages, but transferred in his third year to archaeology and anthropology. This proved a defining moment, for he encountered Miles Burkitt and subsequently Dorothy Garrod as teachers of palaeolithic archaeology at a time of many exciting discoveries in that discipline: he never relinquished his sense of debt to these two scholars for his own subsequent achievements. After his finals, King's awarded him a graduate studentship in 1937, and a research fellowship in 1940, which he held until 1953. The Second World War profoundly affected McBurney's graduate career, though not entirely adversely, as it turned out. He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (USA), training first in air photographic interpretation, on which several distinguished Cambridge archaeologists worked in the 1940s, before a Royal Air Force posting to north Africa. Here he evidently kept his eyes on the ground as well as the skies, discovering several important palaeolithic sites, and planning to return in more peaceful times.<br>
<br>In 1948 McBurney completed his doctoral thesis, entitled &#145;The prelude to the upper palaeolithic in western Europe: a comparative study of the earlier industries from cave deposits&#146;&#151;a first embodiment of the major interests that would dominate his subsequent research and writing, including stone artefacts, the peculiar art and special rewards of excavating caves, and the relationship between Neanderthals and modern humans. By then, he was energetically following up his north African wartime reconnaissance, initially with the geologist Richard Hey: their joint book <span class="italic">Prehistory and Pleistocene Geology in Cyrenaican Libya</span> was published in 1955, and McBurney's admirable Pelican book <span class="italic">The Stone Age of Northern Africa</span> followed in 1960. His greatest Libyan site was the vast Haua Fteah Cave, where excavations in 1951, 1952, and 1955 yielded a deep stratified sequence from the end of the local lower palaeolithic through middle palaeolithic, early and late upper palaeolithic to the neolithic. Painstaking study of the extremely prolific finds by McBurney and many generations of Cambridge students culminated in his important monograph <span class="italic">The Haua Fteah (Cyrenaica) and the Stone Age of the South-East Mediterranean</span> (1967).<br>
<br>From the outset, McBurney recognized the close link at various stages of the palaeolithic between north Africa and the Near East: he was particularly interested, like his mentor Dorothy Garrod, in the origins and spread of the first blade-using industries of the upper palaeolithic. In the 1960s and early 1970s he led several expeditions to find new cave sites and conduct trial excavations in what seemed a key area, Iran and Afghanistan. Surprisingly, no early upper palaeolithic material was found, though some important middle palaeolithic and epi-palaeolithic sites were examined, the latter including the cave of Ali Tappeh I at the south end of the Caspian Sea.<br>
<br>Concurrently, McBurney actively pursued his interests in the European middle and upper palaeolithic, following up new ideas and rapidly assimilating new discoveries or methodological advances. A visiting fellowship at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1975 greatly enhanced his overview of the west European sites, as expounded in his Albert Reckitt lecture that year to the British Academy&#151;he had been elected FBA in 1966. In Britain he excavated at upper palaeolithic cave sites in Somerset, south Wales, and Derbyshire (1958&#150;60), and at the important middle palaeolithic site of La Cotte de St Brelade, Jersey, from 1961 to 1978, the results from the latter site being published in 1986 in a volume edited by his colleagues Paul Callow and Jean Cornford.<br>
<br>McBurney's excavations enabled generations of Cambridge students to participate in important current research: since he taught worldwide palaeolithic archaeology, he viewed each site in the broadest context. The inspiration and stimulation he transmitted to his brightest students, in the field, lecture room, and laboratory, were extraordinary and many subsequently had distinguished careers in archaeology. The abundant time and trouble he devoted to them was often reflected in their own care of undergraduate and research students. Most could also imitate affectionately his distinctive high-pitched voice and mannerisms, but none ever attained his sublime level of absent-mindedness, simultaneously lovable and lethal.<br>
<br>In 1962 McBurney became a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, to which he gave devoted service. He received his Cambridge ScD in 1968, and a personal chair in Quaternary prehistory in 1977. His many other achievements and honours are recorded by Desmond Clark and Patrick Wilkinson in their sensitive appreciation written for the memorial volume <span class="italic">Stone Age Prehistory</span> (1986), edited by G. N. Bailey and P. Callow. He married his second cousin, Anne Frances Edmonstone Charles (<i>d</i>. 2002), on 21 March 1953; they had three children. The marriage was idyllically happy, with the family home a welcoming place, where domestic and academic endeavours seemed to merge inextricably. McBurney was only sixty-five, and had suffered from diabetes for some years, when cancer was diagnosed in 1979. He died on 14 December 1979 at his home, 5 Grange Road, Cambridge: his ashes were interred five days later in the garden of remembrance next to Corpus Christi College.<br>
