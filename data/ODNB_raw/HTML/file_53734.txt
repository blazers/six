<span class="headword">Ellis, Sir  William Charles</span>  (1780&#150;1839), <span class="occ">physician and asylum superintendent</span>, was born on 10 March 1780 at Alford, Lincolnshire, the son of William Ellis, rector of All Hallows Staining in the City of London, and his wife, Sarah Francis Ellis. He received a classical education before being apprenticed to a surgeon&#150;apothecary in Hull, going on to become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. On 14 February 1806 he married Mildred Wood, daughter of John Wood, at Louth in Lincolnshire. Although brought up in the Church of England it was only after his marriage that Ellis acquired strong religious convictions. While living in Hull, and suffering from poor health, he became a Methodist and went on to become a lay preacher. Strong religious convictions exercised a profound influence on his subsequent career. He became widely regarded as a kind man, paternalistic in his approach towards his patients, an image enhanced by his rather stout appearance.<br>
<br>Ellis's interest in the treatment of mental disorders developed during his practice as an apothecary in Hull. By 1814 he had acquired an interest in Sculcoates Refuge, a private lunatic asylum whose treatment principles were modelled on those of the Quaker inspired York Retreat. Ellis's approach to the treatment and management of mentally disordered people owed much to the methods developed at the retreat. At this time public interest in the plight of Yorkshire's insane had been heightened by exposures in the 1815 report of the select committee on the state of madhouses of scandalous conditions at the York Lunatic Asylum, a charitable institution. In response the West Riding magistrates agreed to adopt legislation passed in 1808 and to erect a county pauper lunatic asylum, thus providing William Ellis with a fortuitous opportunity to consolidate his career.<br>
<br>Ellis published a lengthy pamphlet in response to the findings of the select committee and the plans for the county asylum. In <span class="italic">A Letter to Thomas Thompson, Esq. M. P.</span> (1815), though acknowledging his own limited experience in the field, he summarized his ideas on the nature of madness and put forward detailed proposals for the operation of the new asylum. His plan was based on the principle that the asylum should operate on a curative rather than a custodial philosophy, with the productive employment of patients as a central tenet. The leading county magistrate, Godfrey Higgins, was evidently impressed. Ellis was appointed as director of the West Riding Asylum at Wakefield and took up the post in December 1817, with his wife, Mildred, as its matron. By the time the asylum opened to receive patients in November 1818 Ellis had obtained the degree of MD, the only county asylum superintendent thus qualified.<br>
<br>According to his daughter Harriet, Ellis regarded the appointment at Wakefield as a call from God. He regarded each of his patients as a man and a brother, entitled to every effort to bring about either recovery or at least alleviation. The Ellises' regime at the asylum was permeated by the practical expression of faith. Religious instruction was provided every morning both to staff and to the more sensible patients. Each Sunday the patients attended divine service, which always included a sermon from Dr Ellis.<br>
<br>It was, however, in the promotion of work as an essential therapeutic tool that Ellis built his reputation. He and Mrs Ellis developed sophisticated arrangements at Wakefield whereby most physically capable patients worked in some way. The men were employed in agricultural and horticultural work, as well as in trades like baking, brewing, shoemaking, bricklaying, painting, spinning, and weaving. Female patients undertook domestic tasks such as kitchen work, cleaning, and laundry.<br>
<br>Ellis remained at the West Riding Asylum for thirteen years. His considerable reputation led the Middlesex magistrates to ask him to superintend their prestigious new asylum which opened at Hanwell in 1831. At this, the largest asylum in the country, he and Mrs Ellis sought to further advance the system they had implemented at Wakefield. An elaborate programme of work was set in place with patients employed in a wide range of occupations. Harriet Martineau, visiting the asylum in 1834, described large numbers of apparently contented people engaged in all sorts of outdoor and indoor occupations. William and Mildred Ellis created something akin to a large working religious community at Hanwell, an achievement recognized by the award of a knighthood to Ellis.<br>
<br>Ellis's book, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Nature, Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment of Insanity</span>, was published in 1838, having been in preparation since before he left Wakefield. In this substantial volume Ellis demonstrated his continued adherence to established ideas on the origins and practical management of mental disorders. His analysis of causation comprised all the accepted genetic, physical, social, and psychological factors. The treatment methods he outlined included a range of medicines, as well as other physical treatments like bleeding and warm and cold baths, though he recognized their therapeutic limitations. He continued to advocate strongly the more progressive moral treatment techniques, with work retaining its central place in his treatment system.<br>
<br>Ellis retired from the Hanwell post in summer 1838, having taken exception to some decisions which followed political changes among the Middlesex magistracy. His pursuit of a policy of strict economy in the asylum's management was increasingly viewed as penny-pinching at the expense of vulnerable people. After leaving Hanwell, Ellis established a private lunatic asylum at nearby Southall Park. However, he did not long enjoy the benefits of a less pressured existence. The poor health that had dogged his career culminated in his untimely death from dropsy at Southall Park on 24 October 1839.<br>
<br>Ellis earned a prominent place among the great pioneers of psychological medicine, primarily for promoting work as a key instrument of therapeutic change. By successfully implementing moral treatment methods and adapting them to the circumstances of a large pauper institution he paved the way for further liberalization in treating the insane which accompanied the dissemination of the non-restraint system in the 1840s.<br>
