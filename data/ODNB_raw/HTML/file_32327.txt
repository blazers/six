<span class="headword">Cathcart,  Edward Provan</span>  (1877&#150;1954), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 18 July 1877 in Ayr, Scotland, the son of Edward Moore Cathcart (<i>c</i>.1849&#150;<i>c</i>.1886), merchant, and his wife, Margaret Miller. His father died at an early age, leaving the mother with three small children, of whom Edward, the eldest, was only nine. He was on the classical side in Ayr Academy and graduated MB, ChB, from the University of Glasgow in 1900. The following year he went to Germany to study bacteriology in Munich and chemical pathology in Berlin. In Munich he also attended lectures by Carl Voit, the foremost authority on human metabolism.<br>
<br>After returning to Britain, Cathcart spent three years (1902&#150;5) in the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, London, as assistant to S. G. Hedin. For his work on enzyme activity and in bacteriology Cathcart received the MD of Glasgow (1904), with honours and a Bellahouston gold medal. In 1905 he was appointed to the Grieve lectureship in physiological chemistry in Glasgow, which he held until 1915. During those years Cathcart conducted many experiments on protein metabolism, including a study of human starvation, for which he received the degree of DSc in 1908. In 1912 he published his <span class="italic">Physiology of Protein Metabolism</span>.<br>
<br>In 1908 Cathcart spent five months in Ivan Pavlov's laboratory in St Petersburg and in 1912 a year with F. G. Benedict in Boston at the nutritional laboratory of the Carnegie Institution. With Benedict, Cathcart studied the efficiency of a trained cyclist, using the technique of indirect calorimetry, which involves collecting and analysing expired air.<br>
<br>In 1913 Cathcart married Gertrude Dorman (1876&#150;1960), daughter of Henry Bostock (1833&#150;1923), shoe manufacturer of Stafford, and his wife, Alice Susannah. She graduated in science, then in medicine, at Glasgow; and their three daughters all graduated in medicine from the same university.<br>
<br>In 1915 Cathcart became professor of physiology in the London Hospital medical school, but gave much of his time to war service, first in anti-gas duties, then as lieutenant-colonel, Army Medical Services, engaged on special work in connection with the feeding of the army. He employed indirect calorimetry during and after the war to assess the food requirements of recruits, the most efficient rate of marching, and the weight of equipment that troops should be expected to carry, and in tests of new designs of army clothing. The later projects were carried out under the Army Hygiene Advisory Committee, of which Cathcart was a member from 1919 to 1944.<br>
<br>In 1919 Cathcart returned to Glasgow to the new Gardiner chair of physiological chemistry; in 1928 he transferred to the regius chair of physiology, a transfer which did no violence to his interests, which continued to be centred on the human scene. Indeed, in his later years he was out of sympathy with much conventional physiological experimentation on animals.<br>
<br>As a member, and later chairman, of the Physiology of Muscular Work Committee of the Industrial Fatigue (later Health) Research Board (of which he also became a member, and then chairman), Cathcart became concerned with industrial physiology. He supervised a study of weight carrying by women and the physique of women in industry, which was published in 1928, and which was followed by a study on the physique of men in industry, published in 1935.<br>
<br>In his views on industrial and political problems, Cathcart showed no sympathy with what he regarded as the sentimental attitudes of the political Left; nor did he approve of the growing trends towards automation. In <span class="italic">The Human Factor in Industry</span> (1928), and elsewhere, Cathcart emphasized that workers should not be reduced to &#145;machine-tickling aphids&#146;.<br>
<br>Cathcart became increasingly interested in human dietary habits. He supervised five dietary studies of different parts of Great Britain, which were published between 1924 and 1940 and funded by the Medical Research Council, on which he served. These studies employed methods pioneered in Britain by Cathcart's predecessor in the regius chair, D. N. Paton. Cathcart, like Paton, attempted to assess &#145;maternal efficiency&#146; and to explore its relationship to the adequacy of household diets and the nutritional condition of children. He also followed Paton in being sceptical about the practical value of vitamins, and during the 1930s offered an alternative viewpoint on nutrition to that of vitamin-enthusiasts such as F. G. Hopkins, and E. Mellanby. Cathcart's view that such nutritional problems as existed were caused mainly by ignorance rather than poverty, and could be tackled most effectively by education, was also counter to the position of his former student and colleague J. B. Orr. During the 1930s Cathcart was a member of the Ministry of Health's advisory committee on nutrition, of the committee on nutrition in the colonial empire, and of several committees of the League of Nations which were concerned with nutrition.<br>
<br>Cathcart also served on the Agricultural Research Council during the 1930s, and as honorary interim director (1928&#150;30) of the Hannah Dairy Research Institute.<br>
<br>In 1933 Cathcart was appointed to the Scottish health services committee, of which he became chairman. The Cathcart committee published one of the most complete official surveys of the country's health services and gave information of value in the framing of the National Health Service. From 1933 to 1945 Cathcart represented his university on the General Medical Council; and he served as assessor of the senate on the court of the university. He inevitably had less time for teaching and research; and yet, to the day when he retired in 1947, he shouldered the responsibility for the majority of the lectures in physiology to the elementary medical class.<br>
<br>Cathcart was elected FRS in 1920 and FRSE in 1932. In 1924 he was appointed CBE. He received the honorary degree of LLD from St Andrews in 1928 and Glasgow in 1948.<br>
<br>Cathcart was tall, dark-haired, and swarthy, with light steel-grey eyes. His voice was deep and resonant and his accent showed his origins in south-west Scotland. He could be grim and gloomy, especially when confronted with lazy or dishonest work, but could arouse deep emotion and enthusiasm in his undergraduate audiences  (<span class="italic">Obits. FRS</span>). He was remarkably fit until struck down with coronary thrombosis at the age of seventy. He played no sport but loved literature, the theatre, and good talk, sometimes physiological &#145;shop&#146;, more often not. He attended the university chapel regularly; he was a friend and admirer of J. S. Haldane, with whose philosophical outlook he had sympathy. Cathcart died in Glasgow on 18 February 1954.<br>
