<span class="headword">Seton,  Alexander</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1626&#150;1649), <span class="occ">army officer in the Danish and Norwegian services</span>, is of uncertain origins. Family historians have identified him variously as Alexander Seton of Lathrisk and as the son of George Seton of Cariston (1554?&#150;1620) and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir John Aytoun of that ilk, but the case for the former is inconclusive, while the latter is no more than a hypothesis. Nor is it known whether Seton married.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1626 Seton was appointed captain of a company of 500 English foot in Denmark, the same day that the king of Denmark wrote to Charles I asking him to authorize the recruiting of 1000 men by Seton and Francis Hammond. The Scottish privy council authorized Seton to levy 500 men in Scotland on 30 June. By 24 August he was in command of a <i>frif&#339;nnike</i> (a unit attached to no regiment) as captain. His activities in the autumn of 1626 are not known, but on 28 February 1627 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. Probably his unit was to become part of a new regiment with himself as second-in-command.<br>
<br>Seton was wounded in the action at Oldenburg Pass, in the duchy of Holstein, in September 1627, when the Danish forces tried to cover the embarkation of the forces of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar from the superior numbers of the general of the Catholic League, Tilly. Seton joined Sir Donald Mackay's regiment either in the autumn of 1627 or in 1628. Since his company had been ruined by heavy losses he asked about this time for 3000 rixdollars to levy a company of 500 men. He appears to have fought with the regiment at Stralsund in the summer of 1628, when Denmark's Scottish veterans played a major part in breaking the imperial siege of the Hanseatic port. Not wishing to transfer to Swedish service with the regiment when it was reformed in the autumn of 1628, Seton sold the commission for his company to his former lieutenant, Andrew Stuart, and left with the rank of colonel (his reckoning dated 4 October).<br>
<br>Seton seems to have transferred to the Norwegian army, where he is mentioned as a captain of foot in 1628. However, no more is known of his activities until 1645, when he held the rank of colonel in the Norwegian army and navy. In that year he is known to have commanded a squadron of dragoons between May and September, and to have been appointed admiral of a force of eight ships. He is last certainly known of listed as a colonel in Norwegian service on 19 April 1649.<br>
