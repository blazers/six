<span class="headword">Sempill, Sir  James</span>  (1566?&#150;1626), <span class="occ">courtier and religious controversialist</span>, was the eldest son of John Sempill (<i>d</i>. 1579) and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70081/', "Mary Livingston")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69949/', "Queen's Maries (act. 1548&#150;1567)")</script>], daughter of Alexander, fifth Lord Livingstone, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25074/', "Robert Sempill, third Lord Sempill (c.1505&#150;1573x6)")</script>. Both John and Mary Sempill were favourites of Mary, queen of Scots, from whom they received on 9 May 1565 the lands of Auchtermuchty in Fife and various properties in Ayrshire. In 1577 John Sempill confessed to, and was convicted of, participation in the conspiracy to assassinate the regent, the earl of Morton, in January that year. He was sentenced to death but was reprieved and imprisoned in Edinburgh; he died on 25 April 1579, soon after his release. James Sempill was named after the future James VI and I, who, though an infant, was named as his godfather. The two children were educated together under George Buchanan. Half a century later Sempill recalled that James was:<blockquote>the king of my birth, the master of my service, the father of my name, framer of my nature, and the Gamaliel of my education, at whose feet (no, at whose elbow and from whose mouth) I confess I have suckt the best of whatsoever may be thought good in me. (Sempill, sig. A2<i>v</i>)</blockquote>After this privileged start he completed his education at the University of St Andrews.<br>
<br>In 1594 Sempill married Geillis (<i>d</i>. 1618), daughter of George Elphinstone of Blythswood. They had five daughters, of whom Marion, Geillis, and Isobel were alive in 1618, and three sons, Robert, George, and William. When King James visited Paisley Abbey in 1617 Sempill prepared an oration which William, then aged nine, delivered before him in the great hall of the earl of Abercorn. But the boy was dead by September 1618, and George too died young. Sempill assisted James VI in preparing for the press his <span class="italic">Basilikon Doron</span> (1599), and was presented with one of the seven copies printed; this he showed to the presbyterian minister Andrew Melville, who disliked the views on church policy expressed there and saw to it that they were the subject of public discussion. In 1599 Sempill was resident in London as an agent of James VI; shortly after his return in February 1600 he was made knight bachelor, and in October 1601 he was sent on an embassy to France, travelling through England, and onwards by way of Dover. In February 1603 the king, in token of his services, presented him with &#145;a jewel of great beauty and value&#146;, which had belonged to Mary, queen of Scots  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 6.533&#150;4).<br>
<br>After his return from France Sempill seems to have been often at the court of King James in London. When Andrew Melville was imprisoned in 1606 he looked to Sempill as the man to effect his release. Melville remained in the Tower of London but his conditions improved. In 1610 he sought Sempill's advice as to how to further advance his case, revealing his intention to offer his services as tutor to the young Prince Henry, and confiding to his nephew James Melville that Sempill:<blockquote>takes a warm interest in my studies as well as in the welfare of my person, and what is more, I am persuaded that he takes a warm interest in the cause. The court does not contain a more religious man, one who unites greater modesty with greater genius, and a more matured judgment with more splendid accomplishments. In procuring for me a mitigation of my imprisonment, he has shewn, both by words and deeds, a constancy truly worthy of a Christian &hellip; thank him on my account; for he will not rest satisfied until he has effected my complete liberation. (McCrie, 410)</blockquote>This may have overestimated Sempill's influence, but he was certainly a committed Calvinist. In 1618 he published at Middelburg <span class="italic">Cassandra Scoticana to Cassander Anglicanus</span>. In 1619 he provided a defence of the divine ordination of tithes in <span class="italic">Sacrilege Sacredly Handled</span>, which included prefatory verses by Melville. The work, Sempill claimed, was twenty years old. Its publication was evidently occasioned by John Selden's <span class="italic">History of Tithes</span>, published in the same year, and Sempill countered the arguments of Selden and Joseph Scaliger. In 1622, at Melville's suggestion, he published a work against Tilenus, a former colleague of Melville at Sedan, who had become an Arminian. He translated from the Dutch a highly partisan anti-Catholic poem, <span class="italic">The Pack-Mans Pater noster, or, A Dialogue betwixt a Chapman and a Priest</span> (1624). Sempill acquired property in Renfrewshire and Bute, and in Ireland, where he was granted the barony of Carbery, co. Cork, which passed to his eldest son. He died at his house at the Cross of Paisley in February 1626.<br>
<br>Sir James's son <a name="cosubject_25076"></a><span class="headword">Robert Sempill</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1660<span class="mult">x</span>69), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was educated at Glasgow University, where he matriculated in March 1613. He married Marie Lyon, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17286/', "Sir Thomas Lyon")</script> of Auldbar, and they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25070/', "Francis Sempill")</script>, and a daughter, Elizabeth. Sempill expanded his father's satire as <span class="italic">A Pick-Tooth for the Pope, or, The Pack-Mans Pater noster</span> (1669), but his most notable work was the elegy <span class="italic">The Life and Death of the Pyper of Kilbarchen, or, The Epitaph of Habbie Simpson</span>, probably composed about 1640 but not published until about 1700. In this he pioneered the use of the verse form later dubbed the &#145;standard Habbie&#146;, which was used to such effect by Robert Burns. Sempill is also credited with the authorship of the epitaph on &#145;Sawny Briggs, nephew to Habbie Simson and brother to the Laird of Kilbarchan&#146;, and may have written other poems. He served as a royalist officer in the civil war. The Irish lands which his father had acquired were confiscated by the Cromwellian authorities, and though Robert was active in the Restoration, they were not returned. He died between September 1660 and June 1669.<br>
