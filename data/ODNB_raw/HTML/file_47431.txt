<span class="headword">Read, Sir  Alfred Henry</span>  (1871&#150;1955), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born at 10 Georges Road, West Derby Road, Liverpool on 18 July 1871, the son of Colonel Alfred Read of Chester, a partner in the coastal shipping firm of F. H. Powell &amp; Co., and his wife, Emily Blanche, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Musgrave. He was educated at Liverpool College, and then in Switzerland and Paris, before being apprenticed to the Glasgow-based Anchor Line with services on the north Atlantic and to India. In 1893 at the age of twenty-two he joined the family firm, which then owned four small steamers. He gradually persuaded his partners to acquire more ships and Powells owned nine by the turn of the century. Read began to give all the ships names ending in &#145;Coast&#146;, and like other owners transferred some to single-ship companies to spread his risk.<br>
<br>From the beginning of his career Read was keenly concerned to improve accommodation for crews on his ships, and also to ensure that new recruits were well trained, playing an active role in the management of the Lancashire and National Sea Training Home. He was twice married, first to Jean Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Hugh Frederick Macneal, on 11 April 1918, then on 25 September 1920 to Elena, daughter of Henry Fisher and widow of Charles Vincent.<br>
<br>By the turn of the century Alfred Read was a prominent shipowner in Liverpool, and was elected to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, on which he served until 1920, and he was chairman of the Liverpool Steam Ship Owners' Association in 1912. In that year Powells acquired the competing coastal business of John Bacon Ltd, and in 1913 merged with Samuel Hough Ltd to form Powell Bacon and Hough Lines, with a combined fleet of twenty-two ships. Freight rates rose during the First World War, and the coastal trades experienced serious competition from the railway companies, whose rates were kept artificially low by the government. Because most coasters were too small to be requisitioned for military service, coastal shipping was not controlled until 1917, when Read was appointed director of home trade services at the Ministry of Shipping. His contribution to the organization of coastal services during the unrestricted U-boat campaign and his commitment to training young seafarers were recognized with a knighthood in 1919.<br>
<br>Powell Bacon and Hough Lines was sold in 1917 to the fast-expanding Royal Mail group of Sir Owen Cosby Philipps, who merged it with the British and Irish Steam Packet Company to form Coast Lines Ltd, with Read as managing director. The new company, designed to provide connections to the group's worldwide liner services, purchased six more coastal shipping concerns in 1919, including the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company and the Belfast Steamship Company. Other acquisitions followed&#151;the Glasgow-based G. &amp; J. Burns (in which Sir George Burns was the key figure) in 1920; the London Welsh Steamship Company in 1923; British Motorship Company in 1925, and Dundalk and Newry Steam Packet Company in 1926. By the late 1920s it was the largest coastal shipping company in the United Kingdom, and although part of the Royal Mail group it was effectively controlled by Read. An autocratic figure, he directed the greatly expanded group with paternalistic despotism, frequently visiting offices &#145;without warning to the staff [to see] how the work was being done&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span> 10 March 1955). His unrivalled knowledge of the United Kingdom's coastal trades rapidly made Coast Lines the dominant force in the industry.<br>
<br>When the Royal Mail group collapsed in 1930, he quickly took action to save Coast Lines by taking independent advice from the distinguished accountant Sir John Mann. The complexity of restructuring the group made a stock market floatation impossible until 1934, and then only by the government of the Republic of Ireland agreeing to purchase all the Irish business. Read was managing director of the new firm until 1946, and finally retired as chairman in 1950. He also served as a member of the Port of London Authority from 1934 to 1941. He was a founder member of the Institute of Transport in 1919, acting as vice-president (1927&#150;30) and president (1936&#150;7).<br>
<br>Widely regarded as the doyen of coastal shipping, Read was a private man and typical of the new generation of managers who characterized British trade and industry in the first half of the twentieth century. One of his interests was hunting, and he served as joint master of the Avon Vale foxhounds in the west country. Sir Alfred died on 8 March 1955 at the British Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
