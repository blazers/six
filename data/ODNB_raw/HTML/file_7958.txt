<span class="headword">Dowdall,  George</span>  (1487&#150;1558), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh</span>, according to the Dowdall pedigrees, was the son of Edward Dowdall and grandson of Henry and Jeneta Dowdall of Newtown Termonfeckin, co. Louth. His family were probably landowners. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6970/', "Sir Thomas Cusack")</script>, later lord chancellor of Ireland, was his cousin. On 8 July 1518 Dowdall, described as a cleric, was not yet a fully professed member of the community of crutched friars at Ardee, co. Louth. He was employed as a proctor in a number of suits in Armagh's consistory court, suggesting a training in canon law. By 1522 he was being styled &#145;magister&#146;, a title normally reserved for university graduates, although no record of his graduation has been preserved. By June 1524 Dowdall had become the prior of the hospital of the crutched friars at Ardee.<br>
<br>It is not known whether Dowdall joined Archbishop George Cromer in the Kildare revolt of 1534&#150;5, though Sir Thomas Cusack described him as &#145;such a papistical fellow, being able to corrupt a whole country&#146;  (Bradshaw, 126). His hospital was dissolved in 1539 and he became Armagh's official principal. Despite his commitment to Catholic doctrines Dowdall acquiesced in Henry VIII's royal supremacy. By 1540 Cromer was terminally ill and Dowdall was increasingly responsible for the administration of the archdiocese. He visited the English royal court in 1542 in the company of the lord deputy, St Leger, and was promised that he would be the next archbishop of Armagh.<br>
<br>Dowdall was appointed as archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland by Henry VIII on 29 April 1543. His career as archbishop may be traced by means of Dowdall's register, the last in the series of volumes of medieval records which survive for Armagh. His administration may be characterized as conservatively reformist (that is, accepting of the royal supremacy) rather than pro-reformation. None of his actions had a distinctly protestant character. Indeed, Dowdall resisted the extension of protestantism into his diocese during Edward VI's reign. By the summer of 1551, however, faced with imminent imprisonment, he left Ireland precipitately, declaring that he would &#145;never be bishop where the holy Mass was abolished&#146;  (Shirley, 54&#150;60). He was subsequently removed from office. He spent some time with the abbot of Centre, in the Netherlands, and is supposed to have translated a <span class="roman">History of Ireland</span> from a manuscript belonging to Conn Bacach O'Neill at Armagh in 1551  (Lambeth MS 623). He was reconciled with the Roman Catholic church and received a papal provision on 1 March 1553. Mary restored him as the crown acknowledged archbishop of Armagh in October 1553, and he was also a member of her council of Ireland. The title of &#145;primate of all Ireland&#146;, granted to the archbishop of Dublin, George Browne, in 1551, was restored to Dowdall on 12 March 1554.<br>
<br>Following his return, Dowdall convened a major synod to restore and revitalize the Catholic religion throughout the ecclesiastical province of Armagh. Several of its decrees reimposed long-standing obligations. Other decrees on the exaction of burial fees from widows and orphans, and on fees for the administration of sacraments, show that Archbishop Dowdall tried to defuse sources of tension between the laity and its priests. The synod also authorized the appointment of inquisitors to identify and prosecute persons expressing heretical opinions. Heretical books were ordered to be burnt. Within the archdiocese of Armagh the work of restoration was quickly carried out. The decrees issued in the annual diocesan synods in Mary's reign were wholly traditional. Protestantism, clerical negligence, or immorality in Armagh <i>inter Anglicos</i> presented no problem in the primate's eyes. His provincial synod of 1556 did no more than confirm a number of feast days as holy days of obligation, though agricultural labourers were not forbidden to work on those days.<br>
<br>Dowdall was a member of a royal commission established in April 1554 to remove all married clergymen in Ireland from office, the counterpart of similar commissions established in England and Wales. Several Henrician and Edwardian bishops were deprived of office as a result, together with some lesser clergymen, though it seems that there were very few married priests in Ireland. Dowdall was appointed to another commission in December 1557 to inquire into the location of all chalices and ornaments, bells, houses, and lands belonging to parish churches and chapels in co. Louth, with the aim of restoring to the use of the church any such items which had been confiscated. There seems, however, to have been no need in Ireland for the herculean efforts required in England to reconstruct the ritual and sacramental framework of traditional religion following Edward's reign.<br>
<br>With the married bishops deprived, the way was clear for Cardinal Pole to promote two local men, William Walsh, one of his chaplains, and Thomas Leverous, whom he met in Rome, to Meath and Kildare respectively, two important dioceses which encompassed significant portions of the pale. Pole relied on Walsh and Leverous, as well as Dowdall, to spearhead the Marian restoration in Ireland. Following the revocation of the Henrician and Edwardian ecclesiastical legislation by the English parliament in January 1555 the Marian restoration gathered pace. St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was restored on 25 March 1555, a powerful centre of Catholic piety and preaching at the heart of the English lordship in Ireland. Dowdall was appointed as a prebendary of the cathedral, giving him a residence in the capital whenever he had to attend the council of Ireland.<br>
<br>Mary's Irish parliament of 1557 repealed all statutes and proclamations made against the papacy in Ireland since 1534. Statutes for the suppression of heresy were revived but no persecution of protestants ensued. The crown renounced its claim to the first fruits and twentieths, tithes, glebes, and advowsons which, as in England, Cardinal Pole hoped to use for a concerted assault on clerical poverty. Pole also hoped to establish diocesan seminaries to enhance the training of priests. George Dowdall doubtless approved of Pole's strategy. Yet it seems significant that he intended to found a chantry near his archiepiscopal residence at Termonfeckin, rather than a school or seminary, shortly before he died in London on 15 August 1558. In the event his intention, like Pole's plans, came to naught on Mary's death. One study has concluded that Dowdall &#145;was one of the finest figures of the late medieval Irish Church&#146; and that, while he did not anticipate the Counter-Reformation in Ireland, he had &#145;laid foundations which helped to ensure that the counter-reformation would find receptive congregations during Elizabeth's reign&#146;  (Jefferies, <span class="italic">Priests</span>, 170).<br>
