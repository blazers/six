<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1701), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, declared in 1695 that he was about seventy. A native of Kent, he evidently fought for parliament in the civil wars. In 1651 he was a captain in Fitch's infantry regiment when it occupied Inverness. A strong republican, by late 1653 he was in command at Ruthven Castle in Badenoch, and three years later was made major and justice of the peace. In May 1657 he was appointed governor of the fort at Inverlochy, where he enforced justice with previously unknown impartiality. He assisted in planting presbyterian ministers and established a schoolmaster at the Inverlochy settlement, enhancing its role in spreading English culture in Lochaber. In 1660, newly promoted to lieutenant-colonel, he was as General Monck certified &#145;singularly active and instrumentall in his Majestie's happy restauration&#146;  (Firth and Davies, 2.519).<br>
<br>Monck decided that Inverlochy should be evacuated and dismantled, and Hill settled in Ireland, perhaps as a location more congenial for nonconformists. He may have married at this time: by 1690 he was a widower with daughters living near London. Sir Arthur Forbes, a royalist opponent in 1653, and later earl of Granard, was his principal Irish patron, and he was made comptroller of the household by the lord lieutenant, the earl of Essex. About 1679 he became steward at Belfast to the earl of Donegal and constable of Belfast's unfortified castle. In 1689 he persuaded Irish forces not to burn Belfast, using the support of the distant King James and a sympathetic Scottish Jacobite general, and his &pound;300&#150;&pound;400 savings. The Williamite duke of Schomberg appointed him one of three temporary commissioners to manage the Ulster revenue.<br>
<br>In March 1690 George Mackenzie, Viscount Tarbat, another former royalist opponent, brought him to Scotland to persuade the west highland chiefs to submit to the government of King William in return for money to buy out the Argyll family's destabilizing feudal rights over them. His negotiations were sabotaged by those conducted by John Campbell, earl of Breadalbane, intended to delay the government offensive for Jacobite ends. In July 1690 Major-General Hugh Mackay built Fort William on the Cromwellian foundations at Inverlochy, and left Hill as governor of what remained a precarious outpost. At his request William granted the adjoining settlement of Maryburgh a charter on 13 November 1690, as part of renewed plans to promote a civilian settlement in Lochaber.<br>
<br>The garrison and Hill's prudent policies prevented the west highland clans from reassembling as a Jacobite army. He supported the presbyterian faction within the Scottish ministry, but in June 1691 the leader of the opposing faction, secretary Sir John Dalrymple (later earl of Stair), sent Breadalbane to the highlands to achieve a pacification. A cessation of arms was agreed and William proclaimed that the chiefs must take the oath of allegiance by 31 December 1691 before the privy council or sheriffs. Factional hostility and rational distrust of Breadalbane, combined with news that Breadalbane intended the destruction of Fort William (with the loss of Hill's employment and arrears), led Hill to join in unscrupulously undermining his cessation, which collapsed that autumn.<br>
<br>Dalrymple just survived this set-back, but Hill and the Scottish commander-in-chief, Sir Thomas Livingstone, supposed, wrongly, that their involvement in the sabotage would lead Dalrymple to seize upon any further disobedience to justify their dismissal. Hill's feelings of insecurity were increased by distrust of his deputy governor, James Hamilton, in correspondence with Dalrymple and Livingstone. Late in December 1691 the major chiefs hurried to submit ahead of the government campaign. A minor chief, Alexander Macdonald of Glencoe, arrived at Fort William on 31 December, mistakenly supposing that Hill could administer the oath. He sent him with a letter to Inveraray, where he took the oath six days late. Many Glencoe Macdonalds had submitted earlier, and Hill's obligation to the clan was increased by the formal preliminary agreement he made for Glengarry's surrender on 31 December, intended to protect Glencoe also. He ignored an order from Livingstone to attack them if they held out.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1692 Hill unexpectedly received William's instructions, including a conditional order to extirpate the Glencoe men as a warning, and Dalrymple's violent covering letter. Livingstone sent a still more violent letter to Hamilton emphasizing that destroying Glencoe was the way to win Dalrymple's favour. Hill considered the orders &#145;a nasty durty thing and was resolved rather to lay down his Comission then to have putt them in Execution&#146;  (deposition 2 July 1695, NA Scot., GD 406, bundle 633) but temporized, fearing dismissal and destitution, and hoping for a countermand. Giving the clause about Glencoe priority over William's main instructions, he let Glengarry submit on easy terms. By 12 February he had no pretext left for delay and, needing to reassert his authority over his officers, issued a brief authorization to Hamilton to march to Glencoe and execute Livingstone's orders. The massacre ensued the next morning.<br>
<br>Hill recovered his courage, ignored orders to hunt down survivors and solicited permission to resettle them in Glencoe. His regiment kept order in the highlands despite being undermanned, and he again worked to moderate the council's more disruptive orders. He attended the inquiries into Glencoe of 1693 and 1695; in the latter he was exonerated, the beneficiary of a bargain whereby he suppressed material incriminating Livingstone, a member of the dominant faction, in return for weight being given to his real excuses. He was knighted about 1696. Late in 1697 he blundered in accepting the insincere protestations of Simon Fraser (later Lord Lovat) just before he seized and forcibly married the marquess of Atholl's daughter. On 1 February 1698 William ordered that Brigadier-General Maitland and his regiment should replace Hill at Fort William, sparking a plot to burn the fort, which Hill quelled. Hill retired on half-pay, having made only &pound;1000 sterling during his time as governor, and died in April 1701 at Clockmilne, a suburb of Edinburgh near Holyrood, owed &pound;202 10<i>s</i>. by the government. Almost all his highland record was of disinterested and able service in a difficult borderland, but it is for his conduct during his one brief major lapse from these standards, driven by partisanship and moral cowardice, that he is chiefly remembered.<br>
