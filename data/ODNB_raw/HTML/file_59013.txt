<span class="headword">Hall,  Sidney</span>  (1788/9?&#150;1831), <span class="occ">map maker and engraver</span>, was probably born in 1788 or 1789. Nothing is known of the circumstance of his birth, parentage, education, or early life, although the terms of his will suggest that he had a brother and a sister.<br>
<br>Hall first appears in 1814 in partnership with Michael Thomson, an obscure map maker and engraver under whom he may have trained. By 1816 Hall had taken over Thomson's premises in Bury Street, Bloomsbury, London, where he was to remain throughout his career. His early work included maps of London produced for Samuel Leigh in 1818 and 1819, and a set of miniature county maps for the same publisher's <span class="italic">Leigh's New Pocket Atlas, of England and Wales</span> in 1820. By 1821 Hall was already utilizing the new steel-engraving plates manufactured by Jacob Perkins's process. The hardness of these plates enabled engravers to achieve much greater density of detail without loss of clarity, and Hall was almost certainly the first map maker to realize the potential of this development. Among much fine work he is remembered in particular for the fifty-three folio maps, produced from 1827, for his <span class="italic">A New General Atlas</span> of 1830. This atlas was of such detail as to require the separate publication of a closely printed 360-page index of place names in 1831. Equally impressive were the maps produced between 1828 and 1830 for <span class="italic">An Historical Atlas</span> by Edward Quin. These maps show considerable technical virtuosity, with dark clouds (produced by aquatint) rolling back to reveal the world as known to Western civilization at different periods. The finished work is a striking piece of nineteenth-century design and a significant contribution to the development of the historical atlas.<br>
<br>Hall's last work was a set of quarto English county maps for the publishers Chapman and Hall. These maps were used in a variety of publications and could also be bought individually, folded to pocket size, and &#145;mounted in a case&#146;. Periodically revised to include new information, and later photo-mechanically enlarged, they remained in print for the next half-century. Hall died before the set was completed and it is noticeable that counties from the latter part of the alphabetical sequence are signed not in his usual form &#145;Sid<sup>y</sup>. Hall&#146; but with the plainer &#145;S. Hall&#146;. This was the style adopted by his widow, <a name="cosubject_59013"></a><span class="headword">Selina Hall</span>  (1781/2&#150;1853), who continued the business, seemingly without a pause, until her death. Many maps of this period simply signed S. Hall are undoubtedly her work, or work done under her direction, although it was her husband's name that continued to appear on the title-pages of atlases as well as in contemporary directories. Her work is highly competent and may be characterized as slightly looser and more open in appearance than that of Sidney Hall.<br>
<br>Selina Price and Sidney Hall had married on 25 August 1821 at St George's, Bloomsbury. The bride came originally from Radnorshire, Wales. The marriage was childless. Of Sidney Hall's character and disposition no record is found. His circle of acquaintance is likewise unknown, although one of the executors of his will was the London surgeon Sidney Van Butchell, whose forename perhaps suggests a family connection. George Shillibeer was a near neighbour in Bury Street and presumably an acquaintance at just the period that Shillibeer planned the first London omnibus routes.<br>
<br>Sidney Hall died on 18 February 1831, his age being given as forty-two, and was buried at St George's, Bloomsbury, on the 27th of that month. His will provided for his wife's security in slightly varying terms, depending on her continuance of the business. The sale of a copyhold estate in Richmond, Surrey, provided legacies for nephews and a niece. There was &pound;100 for a brother and &pound;50 for his wife's nephew to pay an apprenticeship fee. On the death of Selina Hall in November 1853 the Bury Street premises passed to that same nephew, Edward Weller (1819&#150;1884), who himself became a map maker of considerable repute, and whom Selina may have trained. The family connection was maintained in the naming of his son, Francis Sidney Weller, also a map maker of some note.<br>
