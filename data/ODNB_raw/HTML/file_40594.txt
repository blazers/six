<span class="headword">Pirie, Sir  George</span>  (1863&#150;1946), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born in Campbeltown, Argyll, on 5 December 1863, the son of Dr John Pirie and Jane Harvey. As a small child he moved to Glasgow with his family where his father became one of the most popular and best-known physicians. Pirie attended Glasgow Academy, Glasgow University, where he graduated MA in 1882, and the Glasgow School of Art.<br>
<br>Pirie was expected to follow his father's profession but his interest in art led him to continue his art studies at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, and subsequently at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris under Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre. His specialist interest was painting animals, in particular dogs, horses, and especially cattle which he used to sketch in the Glasgow cattle market. In the 1880s Pirie was associated with the group of painters known as the Glasgow Boys, but he was never much in sympathy with the theories held by most of those artists. He was included in David Martin's <span class="italic">The Glasgow School of Painting</span> (1897) where his technique was described as &#145;always being of a thorough character, even to the extent of being almost over-conscientious&#146;, although his later works displayed &#145;a better method of brush work&#146;  (Martin, 56), an advance that resulted in a finer sense of design and colour.<br>
<br>Pirie was a regular contributor to the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts from 1884 until his death, and also exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Royal Academy, Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, Glasgow Art Club, and the 1888 and 1901 international exhibitions in Glasgow. He was one of the Glasgow artists featured in the famous exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, in 1890. His paintings were also shown in Munich and Dresden. Pirie visited America in 1891 and travelled as far west as Texas. This, and subsequent travels to Spain and Morocco, provided subject matter that especially appealed to him for paintings such as <span class="italic">The Lariat</span>. His work was exhibited alongside other Glasgow artists at the Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, in 1905, and purchased for its collection. Pirie also received private commissions, and painted hounds belonging to the duke of Rutland and Sir John Stirling Maxwell. He was considered to be an excellent draughtsman, with a confident and fluid line. Glasgow Art Gallery owns <span class="italic">Birds of a Feather</span> and <span class="italic">Hill Ewes</span> (1924), two typical works, and his <span class="italic">Mother Duck</span> (Tate collection) was purchased by the Chantrey Bequest in 1940. Pirie's work is also owned by the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow, the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh, the city of Edinburgh collection, Paisley Art Gallery, and Perth Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
<br>Pirie spent most of his life in and around Glasgow. For a short period he stayed in Midhurst, Sussex, but his main residence was Wardend at Torrance, Stirlingshire, which he built in the early 1900s and included a large studio. Adjacent to this was:<blockquote>another building, chiefly occupied by the painter's models&#151;a pony, dogs of various breeds, pigeons, poultry, and rabbits &hellip; Mr. Pirie spends much time working with them &hellip; He is a lover of animals and knows their ways, ailments, preferences, moods and tantrums. (Pinnington, 365)</blockquote>Contemporary photographs  (ibid., reproduced 364&#150;5) of Pirie in his studio with a magnificent highland bull, and seated there beside the fire reading with one foot resting on the back of his sleeping dog lying beside his chair, bear affectionate witness to the mutual harmony between himself and the subjects of his works. &#145;Painting animals as they live, Mr. Pirie's work may be said, in pathos and detail, to approach <i>genre</i> painting&#151;the peasant life of Wilkie and Allan, the toilers of Millet &hellip; more nearly than portraiture&#146;  (ibid., 366). During the First World War he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was a member of the Glasgow Art Club and served as its president from 1928 to 1930. One of his rare figure works, <span class="italic">Impressions</span>, illustrates the club's <span class="italic">Souvenir of the Grand Costume Ball</span> ([1889]). Pirie was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1913, and became its president as well as honorary Royal Academician in 1933. He was knighted four years later, and had the distinction of being the first president to receive his knighthood at the academy as opposed to the palace of Holyrood. Pirie lectured on animal painting at Glasgow School of Art and served as a governor, representing the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1943 he was made an honorary LLD of Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Pirie married Jean Smith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wingate, with whom he had two sons, the younger of whom was the biochemist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65890/', "Norman Wingate Pirie")</script>, and a daughter. He died on 17 February 1946 at Wardend, Torrance, Stirlingshire, and his funeral was at the crematorium, western necropolis, Glasgow, on 21 February. His obituarist commented that it was:<blockquote>impossible to consider Sir George's painting without thinking of the man. In his work there is a tenderness that reflected the character of an artist who revealed himself in his complete avoidance of forcible tones&#151;which led to an unassertive transparency of colour, a modesty of statement, that may have made the unobservant underestimate the sensitive and delicate unity that was achieved. Within a limited range of subjects he was always individual, and, never derivative, he created a style that was the man. (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 18 Feb 1946)</blockquote>
