<span class="headword">Norwood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sirnis]</span>,  Melita Stedman <span class="st"> [Letty]</span></span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was born on 25 March 1912 at 402 Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, the elder daughter of (Peter) Alexander Sirnis (1881&#150;1918), estate manager, and his wife, Gertrude Elizabeth Gurney, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stedman (1878&#150;1967), cobbler. An elder brother, Wilfrid, had died in infancy, and she had a half-brother, Alfred, from her mother's first marriage. Her father had been born in Lemsal, Latvia, and was a follower of the Russian writer Lev Tolstoy. After Tolstoy had been banished to his estates at Yasnaya Polyana his literary executor, Vladimir Chertkov, was exiled overseas and settled in the small Hampshire village of Tuckton. He brought with him Tolstoy's manuscripts and occupied a large Victorian mansion, Tuckton House, on behalf of the Tolstoy Fund. Chertkov initially invited Alexander Sirnis, then living in America, to Tuckton to work as a translator. On arrival he took over the duties of estate manager, and joined the Marxist British Socialist Party. During his stay at Tuckton he translated Tolstoy's diaries, several short stories by Maxim Gorky, and Lenin's <span class="italic">The Collapse of the Second International</span>, and met Melita's English mother, Gertrude, then a young widow, who worked as the community's cobbler. Her first husband, Carl Brandt, had died of influenza in Spain in 1902. Melita's parents married in 1909. Her sister Gerty was born in 1914 in Davos, where her father was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis. The family returned to England in 1915. By this time the First World War had reached a bloody stalemate and Alexander Sirnis discarded Tolstoyism for Bolshevism. He died of tuberculosis in November 1918.<br>
<br>In 1923 Melita Sirnis (or Letty, as she was known to friends and family) won a scholarship to Itchen School, a mixed secondary school near Southampton, where in 1928 she became school captain. In 1930 she went to Southampton University College to study Latin and logic. She was a poor student and failed to complete her course. In 1931, accompanied by her mother and sister, she went to Heidelberg for ten months, where she became involved in anti-fascist activities. Back in England she joined the Independent Labour Party, and in 1932 started work as a secretary with the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association (BN-FMRA), where she became an organizer for the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries. At the time she was living in the same house as her future husband, Hilary Nussbaum (1911&#150;1986), and his parents, Bronislau and Dora, Russian Jews who had emigrated from Russian Poland in the 1900s. Letty and Hilary shared the same politics, and sold the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> and <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span> on Saturday mornings outside Golders Green underground station. Both were members of the Friends of the Soviet Union and in 1934, after a meeting on the shortage of tractor parts on collective farms, she was recruited to the NKVD, the forerunner of the KGB, by Andrew Rothstein. She joined the British Communist Party the following year. In November 1935 Hilary Anglicized his name to Norwood, and on 14 December the couple married, at Barnet register office.<br>
<br>Norwood's spying career began in 1938 when she was involved with a spy ring operating inside the Woolwich arsenal. On the outbreak of the Second World War BN-FMRA was evacuated to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, a fortunate choice as the Norwoods had earlier moved to Cheshunt following Hilary's employment as a mathematics teacher at Cheshunt School. In 1943 Norwood gave birth to her daughter, Anita, returning to work the following year. She was then working for the director of BN-FMRA, G. L. Bailey, who was a member of the advisory committee of Tube Alloys, Britain's atomic bomb project. In March 1945, after BN-FMRA won a contract from Tube Alloys, Norwood (codenamed Hola, or Tina) gained access to documents that Moscow Centre described as being &#145;of great interest and a valuable contribution to the development of the work in this field&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Sept 1999). Arguably the information she supplied on the behaviour of uranium metal at high temperatures permitted the Soviet Union to test an atomic bomb four years earlier than British and American intelligence thought possible.<br>
<br>At the end of the war the Norwoods moved to the London borough of Bexley and Bexleyheath. In 1958 she joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was awarded the order of the Red Banner by the KGB. In 1960 the KGB offered her a pension of &pound;20 a month which she declined. In 1967 she recruited a civil servant codenamed Hunt, who for fourteen years provided extensive scientific, technical, and other intelligence on British arms sales. She retired from both the BN-FMRA and the KGB in 1973, and became involved in local politics. In 1986, following her husband's death, Bexley Trades Union Council established the Hilary Norwood trophy, to be awarded for the best piece of writing on trade-union history in local schools. She was exposed as a spy by <span class="italic">The Times</span> newspaper on 11 September 1999, shortly before the publication by Christopher Andrew and Vasily Mitrokhin of <span class="italic">The Mitrokhin Archive</span>, based on KGB documents smuggled out of Russia by Mitrokhin. She remained utterly unrepentant. The home secretary, Jack Straw, claimed that the information she had provided could only have been of marginal significance for the Russian atomic weapons programme, though the documents in the Mitrokhin archive suggested otherwise; in the event she was never prosecuted. She died of cancer and heart disease at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, on 2 June 2005, having moved in 2003 to Wombourne, Staffordshire to be near her daughter, who survived her.<br>
