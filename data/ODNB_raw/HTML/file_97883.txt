<span class="headword">Marston,  John</span>  (1836&#150;1918), <span class="occ">vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born in Ludlow, Shropshire, on 6 May 1836, the son of Richard Marston (1792&#150;1866), a chemist, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White (1810&#150;1876). His father served as a JP, an alderman, and mayor of Ludlow. He began his education at Ludlow Free Grammar School. Then from 1845 to 1851 he was a boarder at Christ's Hospital in London. At the age of fifteen his parents unsuccessfully apprenticed him to Alfred Darby's ironworks at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. Later that year, he was apprenticed instead to the prominent Wolverhampton tinsmith and japanner, Edward Perry. Upon the completion of his apprenticeship in 1859 Marston purchased the London Works in nearby Bilston, a japanware, tin, and iron plate works employing some seventy workers. On 19 April 1865 he married Ellen (1843&#150;1918), daughter of Charles Edge, architect, of Edgbaston, Birmingham. They had ten children, of whom two died in infancy. In 1866 one of his warehouses was destroyed in a fire but the whole of his losses were covered by an insurance policy with the Old Birmingham Fire Office.<br>
<br>After Perry's death in 1869 Marston purchased his Paul Street Works iron and tin smithing and japanning business in 1871 to meet unprecedented demand. He took his skilled work force with him from Bilston to Wolverhampton, which by 1881 numbered 138. During the mid-1880s the japanware business went into decline. In 1887 Marston, who was a keen cyclist, decided to apply his knowledge of the tinsmith's craft to cycle manufacturing. He registered the brand name Sunbeam in 1888 and began manufacturing cycles. The Paul Street Works was renamed Sunbeamland. The cycle business was a success and in 1889 a showroom and a depot were opened in London. Three more depots were opened in 1895, the year when the business was incorporated as John Marston Ltd. The company later claimed that &#145;In all the chicanery of the cycle boom, they were the one firm which remained true to legitimate traditions and resisted all the blandishments of the company promoter&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 May 1905, 6).<br>
<br>Marston also developed two new businesses during the second half of the 1890s. The first manufactured Koh-i-noor solid sheet metal letters for use as shop signs. The second, the Villiers Cycle Component Company, founded in 1898 on a separate site on Villiers Street in Wolverhampton, manufactured pedals and other accessories for Sunbeam bicycles.<br>
<br>In 1899 Marston moved his business to a larger factory, the Moorfield Works, on Upper Villiers Street, Wolverhampton. Here he experimented with a number of prototype motor cars before deciding in 1901 to manufacture a prototype designed by Maxwell Maberley Smith, the Sunbeam Mabley. Its unusual body closely resembled the early Victorian &#145;S&#146; sofa. The following year the remaining metalware and japanning business was sold to enable the company to focus on vehicle production. In 1905 the Sunbeam Motor Car Co. Ltd was founded to take over John Marston Ltd's motor car manufacturing business. Sunbeam quickly became a leading British motor car producer. In 1909 Louis Coatalen was employed as Sunbeam's chief engineer. One of the cars he designed, the four-cylinder Nautilus, had overhead valves, nickel chrome steel connecting rods, and an air compressor. Years later when the &#145;super-charger&#146; was hailed as a new development which would revolutionize engine efficiency, Sunbeam was able to point out that it had successfully exploited the idea in 1909.<br>
<br>Marston also experimented with motorcycles but abandoned the work when an employee was killed on an experimental prototype. However, he revived the work on motorcycles in 1911 and the following year chose a prototype to be manufactured as the Sunbeam motorcycle. In 1909 he started manufacturing radiators for aeroplanes and certain other component parts. During the First World War the company was a major producer of aircraft engines designed by Coatalen. The company claimed that it produced more instruments for aeroplanes than any other manufacturer in the world during the war.<br>
<br>Marston was active in local politics. He was chairman of the Wolverhampton Conservative Club during the 1890s and vice-president of the West Wolverhampton Conservative and Unionist Association. In November 1882 he was elected to the Wolverhampton school board and in the following month was elected the board's chairman after the election of a nonconformist had been blocked. He served for six years, before standing down in 1888. He was also elected to the Wolverhampton town council in 1885. The council elected him mayor twice: in November 1889 and November 1890. As mayor, Marston sought to consolidate the legacy of his &#145;municipal socialist&#146; predecessors. Wolverhampton had been one of the earliest English towns to address market failure in the provision of public utilities. The town council decided to construct a municipally owned sewerage works in 1863 and also purchased the local waterworks in 1868. Marston was one of the prime movers in obtaining for the sewerage committee compulsory powers for the purchase of additional land for the Barnhurst sewerage farm, and the completion of the pumping machinery at the Cosford Waterworks. He also obtained the royal assent to build a power station to supply electricity for electric lighting throughout Wolverhampton.<br>
<br>In 1891 Marston gave up his council seat on becoming an alderman and chairman of the finance committee. He was an alderman for the rest of his life. During his year as finance committee chairman he successfully negotiated a readjustment of Wolverhampton's financial relations with Staffordshire county council necessitated by the town's elevation to a county borough in 1888. Then as the borough's waterworks committee chairman from 1892 to 1917 Marston worked to improve Wolverhampton's water supply, overcoming strong opposition in parliament to the necessary legislation for the construction of the Tettenhall auxiliary waterworks, which was finally opened in 1911. The freedom of the borough of Wolverhampton was conferred upon him in 1909.<br>
<br>Having retired in 1916, Marston died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 8 March 1918 at his summer home, Coed Emrys, Coed Pella Road, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Colwyn Bay, Denbighshire. He was buried there on 13 March in the parish church. The John Marston Ltd cycle business was sold in 1919 to Explosive Trades Ltd in order to pay death duties on Marston's estate. The following year the Sunbeam Motor Car Co. Ltd was merged with A. Darracq and Co. (1905) Ltd to form STD Motors, Limited.<br>
<br>Marston's eldest son, Sir Charles Marston (1867&#150;1946), purchased the Villiers Cycle Component Company in 1902 and incorporated it as Villiers Engineering Company Ltd in 1912. Charles Marston, who was knighted in 1926, was active in business and Conservative politics, but was best known for his religious fundamentalism, which led him to sponsor archaeological research in Palestine to establish the literal truth of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
