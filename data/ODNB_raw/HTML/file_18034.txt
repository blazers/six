<span class="headword">Marchi,  Giuseppe Filippo Liberati <span class="st"> [Joseph]</span></span>  (1735?&#150;1808), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born in the Trastevere district of Rome of unknown parentage. His date of birth is usually given as 1735, although he told Farington in January 1795 that he was then &#145;73 or 4&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.291). He was probably therefore fifteen, and already showing some talent for painting, when he caught the attention of Sir Joshua Reynolds, whom he accompanied on his leisurely return through the towns of northern Italy and Paris. They arrived in London in 1752. One of Reynolds's first portraits after his return was that of Marchi in a turban, much admired at the time and now in the Royal Academy. In 1764 Reynolds invited Marchi to reside with him for six months and to paint for him, offering to pay him &pound;50. Marchi kept Reynolds's appointment books, set his palette, painted draperies, and became one of Reynolds's most trusted copyists, responsible for many of the replicas of popular pictures that the studio produced. Marchi also took up mezzotint engraving and from 1766 to 1775 exhibited both paintings and mezzotints with the Society of Artists, of which he was a fellow as a painter and a director in 1775. He produced only about a dozen mezzotints but they were of high quality and included fine prints after Reynolds of Oliver Goldsmith (1770) and George Colman (1773). Only one of his mezzotints records a portrait that he himself painted, namely that of Princess Czartoriska (1777).<br>
<br>In 1768 Marchi had made a brief attempt to establish himself as an independent painter in London. In September of that year he also visited Wales with his old friend Thomas Jones the painter. While staying at Pencerrig he painted portraits of Jones himself, his brother Major John Jones, and other family members and friends, before he and Jones returned to London in November. In the following year he returned to Reynolds at a salary of &pound;100. He remained a part of Thomas Jones's lively social set: in 1769, for instance, he was in the party with Jones, Mortimer, Farington, and Lawranson that visited the Indiaman <i>Duke of Gloucester</i>. Coming ashore late at night, they beat off the crew of a customs house boat that had taken them for smugglers, an incident in which John Hamilton Mortimer almost lost a hand to a cutlass stroke. Marchi remained with Reynolds until the master's death in 1792. Reynolds made no bequest to him, but the artist's niece arranged that his salary should continue. Subsequently he was much employed on cleaning and restoring paintings by Reynolds, an activity for which he was uniquely qualified since he alone understood Reynolds's idiosyncratic techniques.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Marchi, who was unmarried, sought the help of his friend Joseph Farington to write his will; it transpired that at the time of his departure from Rome he had two sisters in a convent at Lodi, another sister in Rome, and a brother, Lorenzo, but he did not know if any was still living. Provision was made for &pound;200 to be divided among any surviving siblings. The rest of his estate, valued at under &pound;1500, was distributed among his friends and colleagues. He died, probably at his Wardour Street home, on 2 April 1808, and was buried at St Anne's, Westminster.<br>
