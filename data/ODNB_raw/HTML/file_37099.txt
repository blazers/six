<span class="headword">Aislabie,  Benjamin</span>  (1774&#150;1842), <span class="occ">wine merchant and cricket administrator</span>, was born on 14 January 1774 in Newington Green, Middlesex, the third son, and sixth and last child, of Rawson Aislabie, soap and wine merchant of Newington Green, and his wife, Frances Rayson, of Dunham, Nottinghamshire. He was a descendant of John Aislabie, a Yorkshire MP and chancellor of the exchequer at the time of the South Sea Bubble.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College, Aislabie was a wealthy West India merchant with a well-established wine business in the Minories in London. Little is known about his professional life and he is remembered for his lifelong interest in cricket.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1798 Aislabie married Anne, eldest child of William Hodgson, merchant, of the City of London. They had twelve children, of whom only six daughters and one son survived infancy. In 1802 Aislabie joined the Marylebone Cricket Club at its Dorset Square venue. Thenceforth he played many games, not only for the MCC, but for a variety of sides. He was a notoriously bad player. Throughout his career of some forty years he barely averaged four runs an innings and took a total of eight wickets. A big, heavy man (probably 17 stone), he had a substitute, not only to run for him when batting, but also to field for him. None the less, such was his amiable nature that all welcomed him as a playing companion.<br>
<br>Aislabie's great contribution was as a cricket administrator. Cricket was somewhat unco-ordinated before the early nineteenth century; many fixtures were impromptu and piecemeal, despite the use of rather grandiose labels. In 1822, eight years after Thomas Lord had moved his famous turf to its last resting place at St John's Wood, Aislabie became the first secretary of the MCC, the first sign of any real formality of organization. The following year he was also made president. With the game tainted by gambling and violent disputes, Aislabie's popularity was instrumental in attracting and retaining members, and by the time of his death the membership of fewer than 200 had almost doubled. He organized matches, collected subscriptions, and became central to the MCC's task of developing a legislative and administrative framework for the game. He presided over the club, as cricket was transformed into a well-regulated, even quasi-religious, pastime and a symbol of &#145;muscular Christianity&#146;; it was Aislabie who, in 1841, took the MCC team to Rugby for the match celebrated in <span class="italic">Tom Brown's School Days</span> by Thomas Hughes.<br>
<br>Aislabie lived for most of his life at Lee Place, Eltham, Kent, and at East Park Place, Regent's Park, London, where he died from a throat abscess on 2 June 1842.<br>
