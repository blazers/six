<span class="headword">Johnson,  Joshua</span>  (1742&#150;1802), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Maryland, America, on 25 June 1742, the son of Thomas Johnson (1702&#150;1777) and his wife, Dorcas Sedgwick (1705&#150;1770). His family originally came from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, but his father resided principally in Calvert county on the Patuxent River, in the heart of the Maryland tobacco country. Joshua's eldest brother, Thomas (1732&#150;1819), became a prosperous lawyer in Annapolis, acquired land thereabouts and to the west, and was from 1762 regularly elected to the provincial assembly from Anne Arundel county; he was also a leader of the independence movement in Maryland, becoming in time a delegate to the Continental Congress, revolutionary governor of the state (1777&#150;9), and associate justice of the United States supreme court (1791&#150;3). Of four other brothers who settled in the western parts of Maryland, two, James and Robert, became pioneers in the new iron industry there. Joshua remained in the older part of the colony, in Annapolis, as a small merchant trading to the West Indies and London.<br>
<br>Dissatisfied with the slow progress of his business, in 1770 Johnson joined John Davidson (1738&#150;1794), another Annapolis merchant, and Charles Wallace (1727&#150;1812), also of Annapolis, a wealthy landowner, businessman, and public figure, to form the firm of Wallace, Davidson, and Johnson. Davidson was left in charge of the Annapolis end, while Johnson settled in London in 1771 as purchasing agent for the firm. In such activity he made the fullest possible use of the long-term credit available to the export trades, and thus alleviated the burden on his partners in Maryland who had to remit bills of exchange to pay for the goods he purchased. The firm was badly pressed by the crisis of 1772, provoked by the failure of Alexander Fordyce, during which it became very difficult in London to get bills discounted or credits extended. However, his partners in Maryland were in the end able to remit enough to keep him in business in London. As the crisis abated he persuaded them to let him expand his operations by adding the functions of a commission merchant, selling tobacco and performing other services for American correspondents. In 1774&#150;5 this business brought him 4283 hogsheads of tobacco, primarily Maryland leaf, most often sold to firms exporting to the Netherlands and Germany.<br>
<br>As the political relations between the colonies and the London government deteriorated, Johnson's family and partners were definitely on the &#145;patriot&#146; or rebel side. Johnson considered himself one of the few American merchants in London who consistently defended the colonists' interest. He kept his partners informed of traders there planning to send tea to America, and thus helped provoke the burning of the <i>Peggy Stewart</i> at Annapolis (in which his partner Wallace took a leading part), the Maryland equivalent of the Boston Tea Party. Even after the outbreak of fighting in America, Johnson remained active in London until Wallace, Davidson, and Johnson was wound up in 1777. The next year he withdrew to France, where he settled in Nantes as consul for the Continental Congress and Maryland commercial agent, while continuing substantial private trade. In 1781 he re-established his Maryland connections through the new firm of Wallace, Johnson, and Muir. After the recognition of American independence Johnson returned to London to represent his new firm, soon involved in transactions much more substantial but even more debt-encumbered than its pre-war predecessor. In August 1790 he was named the first United States consul in London.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1785 Johnson married Catherine Newth or Nuth at the church of St Anne, Soho, London. All their eight children appear as legitimate in church records, though four were born before the aforementioned marriage date. This suggests that there may have been an earlier marriage outside the Church of England. Little about Catherine's family has as yet been established. She had a reputation for extreme extravagance and has been blamed in part for her husband's financial difficulties in the 1790s. He was in such straitened circumstances in 1797 that he could not immediately find the cash to pay the modest &pound;500 dowry promised when his daughter Louisa married John Quincy Adams, the future president. That same year he and the rest of his family returned to America, where he settled in the District of Columbia. He was on familiar terms with the Washingtons and other leading personalities thereabouts, but his financial situation remained straitened. His last years were troubled with lawsuits with his former partners concerning his accounts, finally settled by arbitration in 1798. President Adams tried to help by naming him superintendent of stamps in 1800, a position he lost when Jefferson entered office in 1801. Johnson suffered severely from &#145;the gravel&#146; (kidney stones), and he died on 21 April 1802 at the home of his brother Baker Johnson in Fredericktown, Maryland. He left his widow almost destitute.<br>
<br>Johnson was later described by a nephew as &#145;a weak, vain man, fond of great people, and impoverished by an ambitious and extravagant wife&#146;  (Delaplaine, 351). From the marriage of his daughter Louisa to John Quincy Adams were descended many notable members of that distinguished family, including their son, Charles Francis, and grandsons Henry and Brooks Adams.<br>
