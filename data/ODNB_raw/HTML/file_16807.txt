<span class="headword">Livingston,  James, of Kinnaird</span>, first earl of Newburgh  (1621/2&#150;1670), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the only son of Sir John Livingston of Kinnaird, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1628), groom of the bedchamber to James VI and I, and his wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1584&#150;1665), daughter of Richard Sproxtoune of Wakefield, steward of the Star Chamber, and widow of William Marwood of Little Burby, Yorkshire. Livingston was about six years old when his father died. On 17 December 1638 he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, aged sixteen, and, two years after that, Sir Nathaniel Brent reported to Archbishop Laud that although the young man had recently been neglecting his books and had begun &#145;to haunt the town more than is fit&#146;, no one had more civil and gentle behaviour than Livingston did. Moreover, &#145;the remonstrances of myself and his tutor, and our recommendations to his mother to remove him in case he change not his course, have made him a new man of late&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644&#150;5</i>, 302).<br>
<br>Livingston was not always as gentle as he seemed, for in March 1645, while in Paris to continue his education, he fought the first of a long series of duels, on that occasion with Elizabeth of Bohemia's son Edward. On his return to Britain he became a staunch supporter of Charles I, and on 13 September 1647 was created Viscount Newburgh. At the end of the following year he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66716/', "Katherine Stuart (d. 1650)")</script>, whose husband, George, seigneur d'Aubigny, had been killed at Edgehill. Their only child Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68215/', "Delaval, Lady Elizabeth")</script>] became a Jacobite agent. That December he and his father-in-law, Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk, devised a plan to rescue the king from his captors when Charles was taken briefly to Newburgh's house at Bagshot, but they did not put it into effect.<br>
<br>Newburgh and his wife fled to The Hague, where she died in 1650, leaving him with a son and a daughter. He returned to Scotland with Charles II. An intercepted letter from Scotland to his mother, requesting robes for the coronation of Charles II, resulted in the sequestration of his property. In November 1650 he was made lieutenant-colonel of the king's lifeguards. He sat in the Scottish parliament, took the covenant, and was presumably present when Charles was crowned at Scone. He fought in the royal army at the battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, afterwards escaping back to the continent.<br>
<br>Newburgh's military career continued, and he was in 1656 given command of Middleton's regiment in the Low Countries. Much of Charles II's correspondence with Scottish royalists was conducted through him, and in consequence he was excluded from Cromwell's <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> of 12 April 1654. After showing an interest in Anne, daughter of James Douglas, ninth earl of Morton, and being linked with Mrs Jane Lane, Charles II's rescuer after Worcester, about 1656 he married Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1637, <i>d</i>. 1692), daughter of Sir Henry Poole of Saperton, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>With the Restoration, Newburgh's loyalty was well rewarded. His estates, estimated in 1656 as having a value of &pound;411 p.a., were now restored to him, he was granted a tack of the customs of the borders, said to be worth &pound;1000 p.a., and received a grant of &pound;1600, arrears of the tenths of the clergy in the diocese of Lincoln. Elected MP for Cirencester, he was given the degree of MA by his old university, and became vice-admiral for Scotland. He was also made captain of the king's bodyguard and colonel of the 4th Horse Guards. On 31 December 1660 Charles II created him earl of Newburgh, viscount of Kinnaird, and Lord Livingston of Flacraig.<br>
<br>In 1662&#150;3 Newburgh was associated with John, first earl of Middleton, in the king's efforts to establish episcopacy in Scotland, but by 1670 he had to retire from his military appointments because of &#145;corpulency and goutishness&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). He died on 4 December 1670, to the regret of contemporaries, who praised him as one of the finest gentlemen of the age, with untainted principles of loyalty and honour. He was buried two days later, beside his father in &#145;Kinges Armes Valt&#146;, at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
