<span class="headword">Therry, Sir  Roger</span>  (1800&#150;1874), <span class="occ">judge in Australia</span>, was born on 22 April 1800 at Cork, Ireland, the third son of John Therry, a barrister and excise commissioner, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keating. The landed prosperity of the Terry (later Therry) family of Cork had declined since the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>After schooling at Clongowes College, Therry entered Trinity College, Dublin, in December 1818. He did not complete his degree but read law, and was called to the bar in Ireland (1824), though he did not practise. Having been admitted to Gray's Inn in November 1822, he was called to the English bar in 1827. He practised little there, but was a law reporter and, in 1827, private secretary to George Canning, whose published speeches he edited. Favourably noticed by William Huskisson, Therry accepted his offer to become commissioner of the court of requests (a small debts court) in New South Wales.<br>
<br>With his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1874), the daughter of P. Carley (or Corley) of Clones, co. Monaghan, and the widow of John Reilly of Dublin, whom he had married on 9 August 1827, Therry reached Sydney in November 1829. His permitted private practice in the supreme court was spectacularly successful. He was well regarded by Governor Bourke, and was made a crown grants commissioner (1833) and acting attorney-general (1839).<br>
<br>Committed to Roman Catholic causes, and known as an Irish supporter of O'Connell's Catholic emancipation efforts, Therry found advancement to higher public office difficult in a colony where religious intolerance flourished. His successful defence of a newspaper publisher, in defamation proceedings by the influential landowner James Mudie, was another handicap. Mudie's <span class="italic">Felonry of New South Wales</span> (1837) unreasonably attacked Therry and his religious sympathies. Injured by the publication, Therry complained at being passed over for judicial appointments.<br>
<br>Having been drawn to politics, in 1835 Therry stood unsuccessfully for election as chairman of quarter sessions. He was seen as Bourke's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and the defeat embarrassed him and the governor equally. As acting attorney-general, Therry was <i>ex officio</i> a legislative councillor, and his speeches were commended. On the introduction, in 1843, of a limited franchise, Therry had a narrow victory in the seat of Camden after a campaign marred by sectarian rancour. He was a self-styled &#145;liberal&#146;, and his political views so prevaricated that one journalist dubbed him an &#145;Anythingarian&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1845 Therry went to Melbourne as resident judge for Port Phillip, where he was received by a hostile press and a suspicious bar. Maintaining his composure, he disarmed critics by his judicial stature. He was promoted to the supreme court at Sydney in 1846, and at first found his colleagues unfriendly; however, his urbanity overcame their reserve, and his soundness as a lawyer strengthened the bench. He excelled as primary judge in equity, no decree of his ever being reversed. On responsible government (1856) the judges took <i>ex officio</i> places in the legislative council, a duty Therry relished. In February 1859, wearied by judicial overwork, he resigned on a pension, and the following month, after a huge public farewell dinner, he and his wife left Australia.<br>
<br>In England, Therry published his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1863), a useful account of early colonial Australia. The first edition sold out in England, but much of a second edition, printed just as Australian criticisms of the book's personalities became known, was withdrawn. Finding their native Ireland unappealing, the Therrys, in failing health, spent much time at French spas. Therry was knighted in 1869, and became a valetudinarian at Bath. He died on 17 May 1874 at his London home, 21A Hanover Square, and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Kensal Green. One son and two daughters survived him, as did Lady Therry by ten days.<br>
