<span class="headword">Pole,  Thomas</span>  (1753&#150;1829), <span class="occ">physician and Quaker minister</span>, was born on 13 October 1753 in Philadelphia, the youngest son of John Pole (1705&#150;1755), a native of Wiveliscombe in Somerset, and his wife, Rachel Smith, of Burlington. Thomas was brought up as a member of the Society of Friends. In 1775 he visited his relatives in England and, with the object of attending Friends' meetings, he travelled some 6650 miles through England and Wales, chiefly on horseback, during the next two or three years. In 1777 he studied medicine with the physician Joseph Rickman at Maidenhead and then continued his training at Reading. In 1780 he moved to Falmouth, on becoming assistant to Joseph Fox. He settled in London, at 45 Cannon Street, in 1781, was admitted a member of the Company of Surgeons, and received the degree of MD from St Andrews University in 1801. On 5 May 1784 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1823), daughter of William and Mary Barrett of Cheltenham. The couple, who had five children, moved after their marriage to Talbot Court, Gracechurch Street, London, and in 1793 to 102 Leadenhall Street.<br>
<br>In 1789 Pole was made a member of the American Philosophical Society, of which Benjamin Franklin was then president. His medical practice was concentrated on obstetrics; he lectured on midwifery and, being a skilful draughtsman, recorded instructive cases in sketches which were engraved. In 1790 he published his valuable <span class="italic">Anatomical Instructor</span>, which illustrated the approved methods of preparing and preserving parts of the human body for purposes of study, with copperplates drawn by himself. In 1802 poor health forced Pole to move, with his family, to St James's Square, Bristol, where he soon acquired an extensive practice. There he continued his medical lectures, James Cowles Prichard being among his pupils; he also lectured on chemistry and other sciences.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Pole devoted much of his time to ministerial work in the Society of Friends and he took part in many philanthropic schemes. He helped William Smith, in 1812, to establish the first English schools for the adult poor and, in 1814, published a <span class="italic">History of the Origin and Progress of Adult Schools</span>, to which James Montgomery contributed verse. Pole was praised for his sympathy and tolerance in <span class="italic">Devotional Verses</span> (1826) by the Quaker poet Bernard Barton. In addition to being a skilled medical illustrator Pole was a keen watercolourist and silhouettist. He died at Bristol on 28 September 1829 and was survived by four of his children.<br>
