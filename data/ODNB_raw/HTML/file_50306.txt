<span class="headword">Mylne,  Andrew</span>  (1776&#150;1856), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and Church of Scotland minister</span>, born at Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland, was the son of Andrew M. Mylne, fuller, and his wife, Jean Harkis. Educated at the local grammar school, Mylne (pronounced Mill) later ran an English school in Edinburgh, at the same time composing textbooks and contributing articles to David Brewster's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</span>. He also tutored the children of the Edinburgh lawyer and Clackmannanshire landowner, Craufurd Tait, then in dispute with the minister of the tiny parish of Dollar in Clackmannanshire over a legacy for a poor school left in 1802 by a London shipowner, Captain John McNabb. Tait and other parishioners preferred a free day school for the parish to the session's plan for an elementary charity boarding-school. Tait bought the advowson of the living of Dollar in 1805 and commenced to block the kirk session's plan.<br>
<br>In 1807, probably with Tait's assistance, Mylne attended Edinburgh University, graduating MA in 1810, and thereafter commencing to study for the ministry, becoming a probationer in the Church of Scotland in 1812. On the death of the incumbent minister of Dollar in 1815, Tait immediately appointed Mylne in his place. Mylne, as chief trustee, transferred control over the disputed bequest, amounting to the then vast sum of &pound;92,345, from chancery to the Scottish Court of Session. He proceeded to set up a school, commissioning the architect, William Playfair, to design a splendid building, and appointing staff, including a surgeon and midwife for the poor. A man of great erudition and energy, Mylne was set on creating what he called &#145;a Great Academy or Seminary of Education&#146;, in which the poor would receive free education as a &#145;right&#146;, while the richer pupils would have the &#145;privilege&#146; of sharing it by paying fees on a sliding scale. A boarding element was also to be included to &#145;improve the manners and effect a new stimulus to exertion&#146;.<br>
<br>Pupils attended only the subjects of their choice from an extensive curriculum offering: English grammar, writing, arithmetic, bookkeeping, history, mathematics, astronomy, navigation, science, geography, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Persic, French, Italian, German, drawing (artistic and technical), sewing, and botany. The grounds were planned as &#145;Oeconomic and Botanic Gardens&#146; to train a small number of garden apprentices, eventually producing head gardeners for Windsor, Kew, and Canada. Later, an infant school for three- to five-year-olds and evening classes for adults were instituted. This remarkable concept of a school for both rich and poor, which was, in modern terms, both co-educational and comprehensive, soon proved successful and its blend of parish children and boarders lasted, with the later co-operation of the county council, until local government reform in 1975.<br>
<br>Mylne was awarded a DD by Glasgow University in 1821 and was elected to the Royal Physical Society and the Society of Scottish Antiquaries. As minister he was also responsible for the erection of a new parish church in 1841 (designed by William Tite, architect of the London Royal Exchange) and for the learned parish entry in the second statistical account of 1841. In 1844, aged sixty-eight and in failing health, Mylne married Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of Captain Macaulay, RM. He retired as principal of Dollar Academy in 1849 and died at his home, St Columba's Manse, Dollar, on 27 October 1856. He was buried in Dollar cemetery, on the site of his pulpit within the ruin of the old parish church.<br>
