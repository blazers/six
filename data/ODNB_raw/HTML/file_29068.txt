<span class="headword">Wesley,  Charles</span>  (1757&#150;1834), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born in Bristol, possibly at 19 Charles Street, on 11 December 1757, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29067/', "Charles Wesley (1707&#150;1788)")</script>, Methodist preacher, and his wife, Sarah Gwynne (1726&#150;1822). He was the third of eight children and the oldest of three who survived to maturity. It would appear to have been primarily from his mother that Charles and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29072/', "Samuel Wesley (1766&#150;1837)")</script> inherited their musical aptitude; Sarah was an accomplished performer on the guitar and harpsichord and had a particular love of Handel's oratorios, a taste which she passed on to her son. According to his father's account Charles was aged two and three-quarters when he began to display musical precocity, imitating his mother's playing on the harpsichord &#145;without study or hesitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.151). John Broderip, organist at Wells Cathedral, heard the boy at an early stage and predicted that he would be a great musician.<br>
<br>At the age of four Charles was taken to London by his father and Broderip's opinion was confirmed by the blind organist John Stanley. John Beard, manager of Covent Garden, offered to procure Charles a place among the choristers of the Chapel Royal, but the boy's father refused as he had no intention of raising his son to be a musician. After his return to the family residence in Charles Street, Bristol, Charles was placed under the tutelage of an organist named Rooke, although in his father's words, Rooke &#145;sat by, more to observe than control&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.152). Charles's parents oversaw other aspects of education, and without other children to interact with Charles and his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63664/', "Sarah (Sally) Wesley")</script>, his junior by almost two years, developed an exceptionally close relationship which was never to diminish.<br>
<br>It became clear that Charles and his younger brother Samuel wished to become professional musicians and in furtherance of this aim the family moved in 1771 to 1 Chesterfield Street, Marylebone, Middlesex. Charles received lessons from Joseph Kelway and William Boyce, and from 1779 to 1786 the brothers performed in subscription concerts at the family home. Charles also gave command performances for George III and the prince of Wales. His career did not live up to its early promise. He made his living by giving recitals and more regular employment as organist at several Anglican chapels in the London area, namely Surrey, South Street, Welbeck, Chelsea Hospital, and finally Marylebone parish church.<br>
<br>Wesley's output as a composer was almost negligible. His earliest published works were five string quartets which he wrote about 1778 and six keyboard concertos from the same period. He also wrote organ voluntaries dedicated to the prince regent and a set of variations for the piano dedicated to the Princess Charlotte. His other published compositions include the cantata <span class="italic">Caractacus</span> and a number of glees and anthems. His work made little impact in his own day and is largely forgotten. His abiding musical characteristic was conservatism and he paid little attention to contemporary developments.<br>
<br>Wesley never married, but lived with his parents and afterwards with his sister Sally in rented lodgings in the capital until her death in 1828. One of his final addresses, in 1830&#150;33, was on Edgware Road in London. He also made regular visits to Bristol and Brighton. He died on 23 May 1834 and was buried alongside his parents at Marylebone parish church.<br>
<br>The life of Charles Wesley is an excellent example of precocious talent which does not live up to expectation. He appears to have lacked ambition and to have been somewhat eccentric. One contemporary described him:<blockquote>C Westley is as good natured a soul as ever breathed: brimful of vanity he is nevertheless three times as agreeable as any other person that had so large a share. He possesses quickness of thought and sharpness of apprehension which cultivated in his earlier periods of life would probably have settled into poignancy of wit and inexhaustible memory &hellip; he knows no heaven beyond his harpsichord and unemployed with that, he passes his time in dress mimicking ridiculous characters &hellip; or recounts the anecdotes of people of fashion. (JRL, Charles Wesley MSS, DDCW 6/85A)</blockquote>It is possible that had his parents taken at an earlier stage the opportunity of a musical education in London, he might have progressed, but as it is his musical legacy is insignificant compared with that of his brother, and his nephew Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810&#150;1876).<br>
