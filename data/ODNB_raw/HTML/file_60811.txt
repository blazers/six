<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Laban,  Rudolf Jean-Baptiste Attila</span>  (1879&#150;1958), <span class="occ">dancer and dance theoretician</span>, who developed a comprehensive system of movement notation, was born on 15 December 1879 at Donaulande 12, Bratislava, in the Austro-Hungarian empire, the first among the four children of Field Marshal Rudolf von Laban and his wife, Marie Bridling.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Laban's parents were both Hungarian, but his father's family came from the south of France, and his mother's family was from Yorkshire. His father was an army officer whose final command was as governor of the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As he grew up Rudolf often accompanied his parents on their travels. This early exposure to differing cultures, work patterns, and indigenous dance had a strong influence on Laban's later creative work.<br>
<br>Although he became a military cadet, Laban opted instead to study painting. This particularly displeased his father, who had expected his son to follow him in a respectable military career; however, he capitulated, providing his son with a small stipend. In 1900 Laban met and married an art student, Martha Fricke. The two moved to Munich where Laban began his first formal art studies. Here he became aware of the idea that the practice of art involved the spirit as well as the intellect.<br>
<br>In 1900 the young Labans moved to Paris to study painting and architecture at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts. Laban became fascinated with theatre, with its architecture, design, d&eacute;cor, and costumes. These interests led to experiments in form and colour, which engendered his later study of spatial &#145;forms&#146; and movement &#145;colour&#146; or quality. During these heady Parisian days he also began his investigations into the development of a dance script. In addition he created his first dance-dramas and dance choruses. While in Paris, Laban discovered Rosicrucianism. Its practices underlined his growing conviction that the body holds truths to which one can sensitize oneself. Rosicrucian subjects appeared in his later choreography and his high regard for such semi-mystical ideas as the golden mean fed into his fascination with harmony in movement.<br>
<br>The Labans had two children, but disaster struck soon after Martha's second pregnancy. In 1907 she died; the children were looked after by Martha's mother. Laban, devastated, succumbed to the first of many bouts of depression. He returned to his parental home in Vienna. Rejuvenation came in 1910, when Laban met and married Maja Lederer, a singer; they were to have five children. The newly-weds moved to Munich, a city teeming with new ideas about art. Here Laban encountered the pioneering thinking of the painter Kandinsky, the educator Steiner, the composer Schoenberg, the intellectuals Wolfskehl and George, the theosophist Blavatsky, and the <i>K&ouml;rperkultur</i> movement of Mensendieck and Bode.<br>
<br>Perennially in debt, Laban worked as a freelance illustrator. He created costumes and arranged lavish entertainments for the <i>Fasching</i> carnivals, public festivals. Soon he became known for his ability as a director of movement. At the end of the 1912 carnival season, Laban, whose health was never very vigorous, retired to the Weisser Hirsch sanatorium outside Dresden. There began his lifelong search for a basic theory of human movement. And there he met and entered into a liaison with Suzanne Perrottet, a disciple of &Eacute;mile Jaques-Dalcroze, the originator of eurhythmics. Their affair continued for many years with the tacit consent of Maja, resulting in a <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i>. In 1917 both Maja and Suzanne bore his children: Roland Laban and Allar Perrottet.<h2>
<a name="Experimentswithdance"></a>Experiments with dance</h2>In 1912&#150;13 Laban definitively turned his attention to dance. He formed a small group of student followers to further his experiments with its rhythmic and dramatic content. Summer 1913 proved a turning point in the history of dance. Laban founded a summer school at Monte Verit&agrave;, Ascona, in the Swiss province of Ticino. An alternative-living colony already existed at the Mountain of Truth, embracing vegetarianism, nudism, psychoanalysis, and a relaxed attitude to sex. The choreographer and dancer Mary Wigman (Marie Wiegmann) attended that first summer school. Her relationship with Laban remained forever problematic. She was fascinated and in love with him, found his work inspiring, attributed much of her knowledge to his teaching, and nursed her resentment of his casual sexual encounters with more than a few other women. Later she blamed him for not sufficiently respecting her gifts.<br>
<br>At Monte Verit&agrave; Laban trained his group using &#145;swinging scales&#146;, further developed his ideas of body&#150;mind oneness, and created his first theatre dance works. During the following busy season Wigman caused a sensation in her solo d&eacute;but, dancing the <span class="italic">Hexentanz</span> (&#145;Witch Dance&#146;). She established a pattern <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Laban that continued with others throughout his life. He would think through a problem, develop its framework, and then depend on one of his followers to embellish it and give it practical application. He served the role of prime mover; Wigman applied his ideas into the theatre.<br>
<br>A second summer at Monte Verit&agrave; began against the gathering international storm that resulted in the First World War. By the end of July all the students had fled, leaving &#145;the Master&#146; and Wigman time for the intensive work that was involved in developing Laban's framework for human movement. During 1914&#150;19, having sought refuge in Z&uuml;rich, Laban produced leaps forward in his theoretical development; however, the time was financially, domestically, and healthwise a nadir for Laban. He was constantly in debt, concerned about looming conscription, fighting for papers to allow him to stay in Switzerland, and overwhelmed by the domestic responsibilities of sustaining his wife, his lover, his six children, his mother, and his sister.<br>
<br>In Z&uuml;rich Laban founded a new freemason lodge, deepening his experience of mysticism. Here also, as he became acquainted with the work of Carl Jung, Laban increasingly believed there existed a direct relationship between psychic function and the four motion factors of time, weight, space, and flow. He also further developed his emerging system of dance notation. He continued his search for basic ways of defining and ordering human expression through movement, developing his theories of choreutics and eukinetics. The former is the study of spatial forms, exercises based on scales. Eukinetics encompasses the study of the rhythm and dynamics of movement. Much of Laban's training method centred on swinging exercises and movement sequences built from reaching from one point in space to another. This led to his development of a spatial model, the icosahedron.<br>
<br>Disaster struck again in 1918&#150;19. Maja and the children left Laban, his affair with Suzanne waned, and he became a victim of the influenza epidemic. All his work fell apart as he moved from hospital to sanatorium, desperately ill and indigent. When sufficiently recovered, Laban moved to Nuremberg with his newest assistant, Dussia Bereska. He turned his mind to one of the recurring themes in his life: dance as a celebratory and spiritual experience for the non-professional. He organized classes particularly for the youth left disaffected in the aftermath of the war.<br>
<br>The stay in Nuremberg was short-lived. In April 1920 Laban once again uprooted, this time to Stuttgart, where he had finally found a publisher for his first written <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">Die Welt des T&auml;nzers</span> (&#145;The dancer's world&#146;). The book was received as a work of genius, gaining Laban much-needed recognition and even more needed funds. Here a young music and drama student, Khadven Joos (Kurt Jooss), became interested in Laban's work; this was the beginning of the long-term collaboration of the two men.<h2>
<a name="Labanschoolsfounded"></a>Laban schools founded</h2>In 1921 the Mannheim National Theatre invited Laban to become guest choreographer, and there he presented his first major choreographic effort, <span class="italic">Die Geblendeten</span> (&#145;The deluded&#146;), with his own group. They went on to perform in Stuttgart to rave reviews. In the succeeding five years Laban's fame spread. Laban schools were founded in Basel, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Prague, Budapest, Zagreb, Rome, Vienna, and Paris, each under the direction of one of his students. This was a high point in his career as a mesmerizing performer, a charismatic teacher, and an inventive choreographer. He interested himself in both dance as a celebratory community activity and dance as art. He founded the first of his renowned movement choirs in 1922.<br>
<br>Laban moved to Hamburg with his newest <i>amor</i> Dussia Bareska, with whom he conceived a child. In 1923 he redesigned and established his own performance venue and founded two professional performing groups: Kammertanz and Tanzb&uuml;hne. Kammertanz gave regular performances in his theatre; Tanzb&uuml;hne undertook a highly praised tour which had an enormous impact on European dance. Plagued by financial worries, the company was stranded and forced to disband in Zagreb before completing the planned itinerary.<br>
<br>In summer 1926 Laban made his only journey to the New World, on a lecture-tour throughout the United States and Mexico. Laban was not enraptured with what he found. What he deemed &#145;American zeal&#146; rather overwhelmed him. Meanwhile Laban had established a choreographic institute in W&uuml;rzburg with the help of Bareska and his latest collaborator/lover, Gertrud Loeszer. In addition to the institute a group, Kammertanzb&uuml;hne Laban-Bareska, toured successfully. In Nuremberg on 15 December, Laban's birthday, he leapt off the stage at a performance of <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, but the mattresses that should have caught him were not in place. He sustained an injury that permanently ended his performing career.<h2>
<a name="Movementnotation"></a>Movement notation</h2>During this period Laban continued his passionate work of developing a system of &#145;written dance&#146;. In 1928 the system, variously called Kinetography Laban and Labanotation, was published by Universal Edition in a journal, <span class="italic">Schrifttanz</span>. Of Laban's many contributions to the world of dance, this system of movement notation is one of the most important. In the years since his death, with the continuing development by his colleagues Albrecht Knust and Ann Hutchinson, it has become an important tool in the documentation and preservation of dance all over the world.<br>
<br>The first public exposure of the notation system had come the year before, at the Laban-organized First Dancers' Congress in Magdeburg; there it was welcomed as an important contribution by a wide-ranging group of dancers. In 1928 the choreographic institute moved to Berlin, remaining there for two years, and attaining the peak of its success. In 1930 Laban accepted the important post of ballet master of Berlin's Unter den Linden Opera House. He had also been engaged, in 1929, to direct the Viennese <span class="roman">Festzug der Gewerbe</span> (Festival Procession of Crafts and Industries) and organized a moving and triumphal procession of some 10,000 participants. And in May 1930 he served as guest choreographer to the Bayreuth Wagner festival.<br>
<br>When his one-year contract in Berlin was extended for another three years, and Bayreuth invited him back, Laban applied for German citizenship. The rise of Nazism had begun. Questions linger of whether Laban's motive was the temporary embracing of National Socialist ideas or was simply that he wished to keep his employment. In spite of his successes at the opera house, it became clear by 1934 that he could no longer hold the post, as his German citizenship had not yet come through. Consequently he took on the directorship of the Deutsche Tanzb&uuml;hne. He organized a dance festival in December 1934. Over the next two years Laban continued teaching and directing the Tanzb&uuml;hne, finally gaining his German naturalization. In summer 1935 his autobiographical <span class="italic">Ein Leben f&uuml;r Tanz</span> (&#145;A life for dance&#146;) was published.<br>
<br>In anticipation of the 1936 Olympics the Meisterwerkst&auml;tten f&uuml;r Tanz was created with Laban as director. He organized a gigantic performance with 1000 participants. Goebbels, head of the propaganda ministry, attended the final rehearsal. Goebbels's fateful words marked the beginning of the end of Laban's German career: &#145;I do not like it. That is because it is dressed up in our clothes and has nothing whatever to do with us&#146;  (Preston-Dunlop, <span class="italic">Rudolf Laban</span>, 196). The performance was forbidden and thereafter Laban was hounded by investigations, castigated for having been a freemason, unveiled as not being a member of the Nazi party, and discovered to be living with a Jewish woman. Sick and disheartened, with no possibility of earning a living, Laban left for Paris, where Jooss found him in a state of mental and physical collapse. Jooss invited Laban to come to England.<br>
<br>For the next years Laban lived at Dartington Hall as a guest of Jooss's hosts, the Elmhirsts. Since he was a German alien, the government permitted him to stay only if he agreed not to seek employment either paid or unpaid. In any event his ill health forbade his working. A former student, <a name="cosubject_60811"></a><span class="headword">Elisabeth Maria Martha <span class="st"> [Lisa]</span> Ullman</span>  (1907&#150;1985), who had been born in Berlin on 17 June 1907, befriended him and began nursing him back to health. Thus began a new phase in Laban's life.<h2>
<a name="Lastdecades"></a>Last decades</h2>During the difficult war years Ullman, an inspiring teacher of dance in education, acted as Laban's spokeswoman. He planned what she so beautifully taught. In 1940 the government ordered them, as aliens, to leave the nurturing environment of Dartington, which was close to the naval base at Dartmouth. In 1942 they established themselves in Manchester where Lisa, with the support of the Elmhirsts, opened a school. Laban returned to lecturing and writing. The school flourished. Much later, in 1953, it moved to more spacious quarters in Addlestone, Surrey. Laban movement training, as conceived by Laban and taught by Ullman, became a pedagogical tool used in schools throughout Britain. After Laban's death Ullman devoted herself to translating and editing his writings. She became a naturalized British citizen in 1947. Ullman died in Chertsey, Surrey, on 25 January 1985.<br>
<br>The eminent industrialist Frederick Lawrence heard of Laban's work and became convinced that the training might have a practical application in the factory. Thus began a whole new area of exploration. Along with Lawrence, Laban developed ways of retraining employees for unaccustomed kinds of work, most notably preparing women to take over the work of men. Laban was permitted at last to earn his own way in Britain and to contribute to the war effort. His collaboration with Lawrence resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">Effort</span> (1947), a small book describing how to graph natural effort patterns in order to match innate patterns with needed work skills.<br>
<br>Never happy being too far from theatre and movement as art, Laban also revived his interest in movement training for actors, which culminated in the publication in 1950 of his <span class="italic">Mastery of Movement on the Stage</span>. In his final ten years Laban began to work on his newest area of interest: how movement could be used therapeutically. He engaged in research into personality, stress, and intervention techniques, a study which occupied him until his death on 1 July 1958 in Weybridge, where he was buried.<br>
<br>Rudolf Laban, charismatic teacher, brilliant dreamer, philosopher, dancer, choreographer, author, and experimenter, was a man with a rare combination of personal magnetism and genius. His work ranged from the methodical to the fantastic, from the disciplined to the wildly imaginative. His contribution has permanently changed what we see as the place of movement in our lives.<br>
