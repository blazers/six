<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phelps,  Lancelot Ridley</span>  (1853&#150;1936), <span class="occ">college head and authority on social administration</span>, the third son of Thomas Prankerd Phelps, rector of Ridley, Kent, and honorary canon of Rochester Cathedral, and his wife, Laura, fourth daughter of Sir Percival Hart Dyke, fifth baronet, was born at Ridley on 3 November 1853. He was educated at Charterhouse School (of the governing body of which he was later for many years a valuable member) and at Oriel College, Oxford. Admitted a scholar in 1872, he obtained seconds in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>. He then studied for two semesters at Leipzig and G&ouml;ttingen universities. He was elected a fellow of Oriel in 1877, and ordained deacon in 1879 and priest in 1896. He was a lecturer (1880&#150;85) and vice-principal (1885&#150;93) of St Mary Hall; and was tutor (1893&#150;1914), provost (1914&#150;29), and honorary fellow (1929&#150;36) of Oriel. On the occasion of the college sexcentenary in 1926 the university conferred upon him the honorary degree of DCL. He died, unmarried, at his home, 24 Norham Road, Oxford, on 16 December 1936.<br>
<br>As a tutor of the college, Phelps was responsible for the general supervision of one third of its undergraduates, and he was the friend of many more. He talked with them late into the night; he took them on reading parties to High Force, on the Tees; he kept up a lifelong correspondence with many of them. He probably had as wide and deep an influence as any Oxford tutor of his time. He never became a specialist in any academic subject, but he had a very active and lively mind, and was an excellent and popular lecturer on classics and on political economy. In particular, his lectures on economics to Indian Civil Service probationers influenced many who became distinguished civil servants; and in later years he had an equally great influence on the members of the Sudan civil service.<br>
<br>Two matters in which Phelps was deeply interested were the fabric of the college and the college estates. It was mainly to his efforts that the college owed the adornment of the hall by panelling and stained-glass windows executed by his friend John Ninian Comper; he was a frequent visitor to the estates, where he rode and shot with the farmers and discussed the crops and stock. To his colleagues he was perhaps most completely himself as steward of the common room. An admirable talker and raconteur, he never monopolized the conversation; he insisted that this must be general, and his art in its management resembled nothing so much as that of a conductor who draws its best out of every instrument. Another side of his interests is illustrated by his notable collection of paintings by William Turner of Oxford, which he sold in 1929 after his resignation from the provostship.<br>
<br>A supporter of the university extension movement and a member of the executive committee of the Toynbee Hall Settlement in the East End of London, Phelps was a leading exponent of T. H. Green's ideals of active citizenship. He was for many years a councillor and afterwards an alderman, and was a leading figure in the Oxford Cottage Improvement Society. His main activity outside the college was his work as chairman of the Oxford board of guardians of the poor from 1912 (he had been a guardian since 1880), and later of the public assistance committee. An active member of the Charity Organization Society, Phelps combined a great interest in the welfare of the poor with a truly Gladstonian economy and individualism. He was a member of the royal commission on the poor laws (1905&#150;9), and his views were prominent in the majority report, which he had a hand in drafting. In 1929&#150;30 he served as chairman of a Home Office departmental committee on the relief of the casual poor. The principles set forth at length in the reports of these two bodies had been briefly and lucidly stated in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Poor Law and Charity</span>, published by Phelps as early as 1887.<br>
