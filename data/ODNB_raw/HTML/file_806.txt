<span class="headword">Aspland,  Robert Brook</span>  (1805&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born at Newport, Isle of Wight, on 19 January 1805, the eldest surviving son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/805/', "Revd Robert Aspland (1782&#150;1845)")</script> and his wife, Sara Middleton (1770/71&#150;1858). After schooling with the Revd John Potticary at Blackheath, Kent, and with the Revd William Evans, minister of the Abbey Chapel, Tavistock, he entered the University of Glasgow in 1819, graduating MA in 1822. After studying at Manchester College, York, from 1822 to 1826, he entered the ministry at Chester in August 1826. In 1833 he became co-pastor with the Revd Lant Carpenter at Lewin's Mead, Bristol. On 21 October 1833 in Mottram, Cheshire, he married Jane (1812&#150;1872), fourth daughter of Randal Hibbert (1769&#150;1849), farmer and cotton manufacturer of Godley, Cheshire; two sons were born in the marriage. Aspland also conducted a boarding-school in Bristol until 1836, when he moved to Old Chapel in Dukinfield, Cheshire, taking up the ministry there on 1 January 1837. In 1858 he became minister at the New Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney, in a newly built Gothic church on the site of the chapel (of the same name) where his father had ministered for almost forty years. The congregation had been much divided by ministries in the interim, but the &#145;new Aspland&#146; its leaders had been hoping for, while he was admired and influential, could not stop a long-term decline in a congregation in an area which was losing its respectable inhabitants.<br>
<br>Aspland's services to his denomination were of the first importance. During his father's last illness in 1845 he took over the editorship of the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, continuing with great distinction until the magazine ceased publication in 1863. In it in 1850 he published a long memoir of his father (reprinted the same year as a book), a number of valuable brief congregational histories, and a series of sketches that drew on his deep historical knowledge of early English protestantism.<br>
<br>In 1846 Aspland became one of the secretaries of Manchester College, in Manchester after 1840 and in London from 1853; he resigned in 1857 in disagreement with the direction the college was taking, dominated as it then was by John James Tayler and James Martineau, the leaders of the &#145;new school&#146; of Unitarians who sought to base religion in instinct and emotion rather than natural and biblical evidences. A splendid man of business as well as a strong liberal, he had taken a major role in securing passage in 1844 of the <span class="roman">Dissenters' Chapels Act</span>, to prevent the expropriation of Unitarian chapels and endowments by orthodox groups whose claims had been upheld in the courts. He was, therefore, a logical successor in 1859 to Edward Tagart as secretary of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. Although his sympathies lay with the conservative theological position and his letters betray a degree of contempt for its opponents, he played a calming diplomatic part in the fierce debate in 1865&#150;6 over criteria for membership in the association, a magnanimity generously recognized at the time of his death and notably evident in the choice of Martineau to deliver the address at the funeral.<br>
<br>His health deteriorating, Aspland attempted to resign the secretaryship in 1867 but was persuaded to remain, with the Revd Robert Spears as assistant secretary. His last sermon was delivered on 13 June 1869, and his last letter accepted a three-month leave pressed on him by a worried congregation. He died suddenly on 21 June 1869 at 1 Frampton Park Villas, Hackney, and was buried on 26 June in the family vault in the burial-ground of the New Gravel Pit Chapel.<br>
