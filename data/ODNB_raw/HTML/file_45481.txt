<span class="headword">Beeton,  Samuel Orchart</span>  (1831&#150;1877), <span class="occ">publisher and journalist</span>, was born on 2 March 1831 at 39 Milk Street in Cheapside, London, the only son of Samuel Powell Beeton (1804&#150;1854), warehouseman and publican, and his first wife, Helen (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of Thomas Orchart, a baker. Because his mother died soon after his birth, Samuel was brought up by his Beeton grandmother. His only formal education was at Pilgrim's Hall Academy, a small private school in Brentwood, Essex, which he attended aged twelve to fourteen. He was then apprenticed to a paper merchant in the City for seven years during which apparently he had &#145;quite a gay time&#146; but must also have laid the foundations for his subsequent career  (Spain, 42).<br>
<br>At twenty-one, with some money from his father, Beeton set up as a publisher in partnership with Charles H. Clarke. Through a series of accidents they immediately had the opportunity to publish <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> by an unknown American, Harriet Beecher Stowe. Beeton saw the novel's potential for the British market and its message chimed with his politics. He seized the chance to publish, showing that combination of energy, financial shrewdness, and faith in popular print as a medium for social improvement which was to characterize his career. The immense sales of this book helped underpin his innovative publishing ventures. In April 1852, the same month as <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> appeared, Beeton launched the first magazine for middle-class women, a twopenny monthly, the <span class="italic">English Woman's Domestic Magazine</span>. He followed it in January 1855 with another pioneering journal, the <span class="italic">Boy's Own Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>In the following year (10 July 1856) in Epsom parish church, Beeton married Isabella Mary Mayson (1836&#150;1865) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37172/', "Beeton, Isabella Mary")</script>], the eldest daughter of Benjamin Mayson, a linen merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, whose second husband was Henry Dorling, clerk of the Epsom racecourse. The marriage of Sam and Bella proved a happy partnership in both personal and business terms. He encouraged her to write the work for which the name Beeton is still remembered, <span class="italic">Beeton's Book of Household Management</span>, which was first issued in parts between 1859 and 1861. She played an increasingly active role in the business, from which Clarke now departed, and with her support, Beeton entered the happiest stage of his career, producing a series of Beeton titles including dictionaries, guides, and <span class="roman">All About It</span> books, as well as a <span class="italic">Christmas Annual</span>. Together they built on his earlier successes with women's and boys' magazines, launching new titles and expanding existing ones.<br>
<br>Beeton's private life was more clouded, despite his happy marriage. Neither of the couple's first two children&#151;both sons called Samuel Orchart&#151;survived, the first dying immediately, the second aged three. However, they had another son, called simply Orchart, born on new year's eve 1863 in Greenhithe, Kent, to which they had just moved from Pinner, Middlesex. He survived, as did their fourth son, Mayson, born on 29 January 1865. However, as a result of this last confinement Isabella developed puerperal fever and died on 6 February, aged twenty-eight.<br>
<br>This was a professional as well as a personal tragedy. Beeton's publishing and writing continued but his financial position was undermined by the collapse in May 1866 of the house of Overend and Gurney in which he had substantial investments. He was forced to sell his titles and his name to his rivals, Ward, Lock, and Tyler, for whom he undertook to work exclusively in future. He continued to produce Beeton titles with enormous energy, publishing nearly thirty in the next five years. However, from 1867 the <span class="italic">English Woman's Domestic Magazine</span> was caught up in controversy over a correspondence on tight-lacing and on beating. More seriously, in 1872 Beeton's relationship with Ward and Lock (as it now was) deteriorated sharply over his use of the <span class="italic">Beeton Christmas Annual</span> to satirize the royal family. The legal tangle over the name Beeton led to two court cases in 1874 and 1875, which left him free but without possession of his earlier titles. His return to independent publishing was hampered by ill health and he died at Sudbrook Park, Petersham, Richmond, Surrey, on 6 June 1877 of pulmonary consumption, which had affected him for years.<br>
<br>Physically slight, but attractive, and prodigiously energetic, Beeton was a republican, a supporter of women's suffrage, and anti-establishment in religion and politics, as well as an innovative publisher, editor, and journalist. His achievement is difficult to assess; firstly, because these roles tended to overlap in his work and, secondly, because of the sale of his name and titles. Nevertheless he stands as one of the pioneers of popular print&#151;particularly for women and boys.<br>
