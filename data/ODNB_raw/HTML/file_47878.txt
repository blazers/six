<span class="headword">Wycherley, Sir  Robert Bruce</span>  (1894&#150;1965), <span class="occ">building society manager</span>, was born on 5 April 1894 at Newtown, Montgomeryshire, the son of the Revd Richard Wycherley, a Primitive Methodist minister, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bruce. He was educated in schools at Oakengates, Shropshire, and Scorton, Yorkshire, and first worked as a clerk in the West Riding education department. In the First World War he spent four years in the army, mostly in France; he was decorated with the Military Cross and bar and was a captain when demobilized. Following a brief return to the education department he became secretary of the West Yorkshire pensions committee and then, in 1921, of the Halifax Engineering Employers Association.<br>
<br>In 1929 Wycherley moved to London and joined the National Building Society, which had enjoyed very rapid growth since 1918. Its board felt that the administration had not adjusted to the size of the business and recruited Wycherley to take over the administration in due course. Starting as assistant secretary, he became secretary (1931), general manager (1933), and managing director (1937), having joined the board in 1936. He tightened and mechanized the administration, enjoying the advantage of a purpose-built head office in Moorgate opened in 1930.<br>
<br>The National had long been established in the heart of the City. Provided competitive interest rates were offered, there was no shortage of funds; with no branch offices, however, finding borrowers was more of a problem for the National. The solution was the employment of full-time representatives, mostly in the south-east, whose job it was to contact builders developing estates. Somewhat controversially, finance for house building was then advanced by the building society on the security of the land, and the developers were paid commission for any borrowers they introduced to the National. The builder could stimulate sales by giving, without informing the buyer, a guarantee to the building society where a loan in excess of the usual percentage of the purchase price was made. The precise details of these arrangements became the focus of increasingly intense competition between societies. The National Association of Building Societies, with Wycherley as a council member from 1934, struggled throughout the 1930s to agree and enforce a restraining code of conduct. Although the National Association was replaced in 1936 by the Building Societies Association, with support for a code a condition of membership, the forces of competition continued unchecked until restraint was imposed by the <span class="roman">Building Societies Act</span> 1939.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war the new association appointed a committee of five to safeguard the interests of societies. This committee included Wycherley and Sir Harold Bellman of the Abbey Road Society. One consequence was the merger of their two societies in 1944 to form the Abbey National. Wycherley and Bellman were joint managing directors until 1948, after which Wycherley acted alone, although with Bellman continuing as chairman. Wycherley served as chairman of the association from 1943 to 1946&#151;difficult years, as the prominent post-war part that societies had seen for themselves was at odds with the modest role that the government allowed. Wycherley managed to sustain reasonable co-operation between them. His condemnation of the excesses of the 1950s, with some societies making large loans to speculative property companies, made his an influential voice when new legislation to restrain these excesses was passed in 1960. Severe illness in 1962 forced Wycherley to leave the association's council in 1964 after thirty years; he was made a vice-president.<br>
<br>An early associate member of the Building Society Institute (the professional staff association), Wycherley became a fellow in 1939. He was a member of its council from 1935 to 1947 and chaired the superannuation and benevolent committees. He played a part in the re-establishment of the International Association of Building Societies. Other business interests were the deputy chairmanship of the Royal Insurance Company and directorships of both the Globe and the Liverpool and Lancashire insurance companies and of the South Essex Water Board. He was a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries from 1924, treasurer in 1950, and president in 1954. He received a knighthood in 1953.<br>
<br>Wycherley's recreations included music, as he had long been an accomplished organist, and also gardening and golf. He was a freeman of the City of London, president of the City Livery Club, and a member of the court of the Innholders' Company. A freemason, he was accorded &#145;grand rank&#146; for his services, including grand deacon of England. He married twice: in 1920 Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1942), the daughter of Edward Land Harrison, an ironmonger of Wakefield, and in 1943 Margaret, the daughter of William L. Morton, an engineer of Forfar. He had two daughters, one from each marriage. Wycherley died from cancer on 17 March 1965 at his Kent home, High Timber, Chislehurst Road, Chislehurst, survived by his second wife. He was cremated after a funeral service at Christ Church, Chislehurst.<br>
