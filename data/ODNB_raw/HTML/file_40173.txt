<span class="headword">Dunderdale,  Wilfred Albert</span>  (1899&#150;1990), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born in Russia on 24 December 1899, the son of Richard Albert Dunderdale, a British shipowner, whose vessels traded between Constantinople and the Russian ports on the Black Sea, and his wife, Sophie. He was educated in Russia, at the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Nikolayev, Ukraine, and was studying naval engineering at Petrograd University when the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917. Much of the Russian navy remained in White Russian hands. Dunderdale was contacted by the Royal Navy, who found his great knowledge of the Russian language and the Russian navy invaluable.<br>
<br>At this time Constantinople, where Dunderdale had numerous friends, had been occupied by the allies. On one occasion in 1919 a submarine was being handed over by the allies to the White Russian navy. Dunderdale discovered that the crew were Bolsheviks who intended to murder the tsarist officers together with the liaison officer (himself) as soon as the vessel sailed. The crew was arrested and Dunderdale was appointed MBE in 1920. In the same year he became a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. During this period he was also sent as the British observer and interpreter to accompany the imperial procurator on his investigation into the murder of the Russian imperial family at Yekaterinburg, which had been recaptured by the White Russian army. As a result he remained convinced of the falseness of the pretender Anastasia, who he said was merely the Polish girlfriend of one of the Bolshevik gaolers who had occasionally done some sewing for the tsarina.<br>
<br>The world of Constantinople, from the end of the First World War until Kemal Atat&uuml;rk deposed Sultan Muhammad in 1922, was one of classical Byzantine intrigue on a grand scale. The only stabilizing factor was the heavy guns of the Royal Navy, which were trained on the centre of the city. Dunderdale was in his element and in 1921 he was recruited by MI6, with whom he remained until 1959. He had found his spiritual home. He always maintained that his first job for MI6 was to pay off, with gold sovereigns, all the foreign members of the sultan's harem and to repatriate them through the good offices of the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>In 1926 Dunderdale was posted to Paris to represent MI6's interests and to liaise with the French Deuxi&egrave;me Bureau. He stayed in Paris until 1940. The central weapon in his armoury was his personality. He spoke several languages well, and was debonair and a wonderful host. There was about him an element of the pirate; he was a romantic with enormous vitality and a gift for friendship. If the truth of past dramatic events was occasionally expanded in telling the story, his friends readily forgave him. His flat in Paris became a meeting-place for international visitors and a venue for political gossip. His relations with the Deuxi&egrave;me Bureau became close and he played a major role in one great intelligence coup. He had become a close personal friend of Colonel Gustave Bertrand, the Deuxi&egrave;me Bureau chief signals officer, and they were both friendly with the Polish intelligence service in Paris. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, they managed to smuggle out of Poland to Paris a model of the top secret German encoding machine known as Enigma. Dunderdale took it over to London himself, in romantic circumstances. It was the biggest single contribution to the vital intelligence results achieved by the British decoding centre at Bletchley Park, and was perhaps the greatest allied intelligence coup of the war. He was appointed CMG in 1942.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1940 Dunderdale had to return to London. He ran a small group of agents into French seaports, but his contribution gradually diminished. Part of the reason for this was that, as Charles de Gaulle became increasingly powerful in London and set up his own intelligence organization, Dunderdale's contacts with the old Deuxi&egrave;me Bureau became an object of suspicion: a number of its officers were indeed working with the Vichy government. After the war Dunderdale refused to have an office in MI6's headquarters because the aura of Whitehall was intolerable to him; he was allowed to set up a small office nearby. There, with lovely oriental carpets, portraits of the queen and the tsar, a whiff of incense, and a fine model of a Russian destroyer of 1912, he provided a home from home for many foreign visitors from pre-war days. He also made two further contributions. When de Gaulle resigned early in 1946 an intelligence amalgamation took place in Paris between the pre-war professionals and those who worked for the French general. Dunderdale played a useful role in bridging the gap between the new generation of MI6 officers and his pre-war French colleagues. Second, in his final period with MI6 his company and his worldly knowledge were a constant pleasure and profit to his younger colleagues. He was an officer of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur, a holder of the French Croix de Guerre (with palm), and an officer of the American Legion of Merit.<br>
<br>Always known as Biffy, Dunderdale was neat, dark, immaculately dressed, and stubby in build, and he always had a Balkan cigarette, in a long, black, ivory holder, in his hand. In 1928 he married June Woodbridge Ament-Morse of Washington, USA. The marriage was dissolved in 1947 and in 1952 he married Dorothy Mabel Brayshaw Hyde, daughter of James Murray Crofts DSc. They had a happy marriage and lived in London until her death in 1978. After his wife died there was little left to keep Dunderdale in England and he went to live in New York, where he had some old friends. In 1980 he married Deborah, widow of Harry McJ. McLeod and daughter of Eugene B. Jackson, of Boston, Massachusetts. There were no children of any of the marriages. Dunderdale died on 13 November 1990 in New York.<br>
