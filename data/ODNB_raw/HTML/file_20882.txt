<span class="headword">Osborne <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Haggenson]</span>,  Ruth</span>  (1682&#150;1751), <span class="occ">alleged witch</span>, details of whose upbringing are unknown, lived with her husband, John Osborne (<i>b</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. in or after 1751), a labourer, at Gubblecote, a small settlement near Tring, Hertfordshire. For many years the couple were rumoured to be Jacobites and witches by many in the neighbourhood. It was believed by some that Ruth Osborne had even bewitched her own brother, a man named Haggenson, who lived in a neighbouring parish. Because of such rumours the Osbornes found it difficult to get work and they were reliant on poor relief. In 1745 Ruth went to the farm of one John Butterfield to beg for buttermilk. The farmer angrily told her to be off as &#145;he had not enough for his hogs&#146;, and Ruth retorted that &#145;the pretender would have him and his hogs too&#146;. When, several months later, some of his calves died Butterfield concluded that Osborne must have bewitched them. Butterfield was eventually forced out of farming and by 1751 he was running the Black Horse alehouse at Gubblecote Cross. He believed he was still under a spell, however, as he suffered from recurring fits. Some of his customers, including one Thomas Colley, suggested he consult a cunning-woman. He followed this advice and she told him that he had been bewitched by &#145;two of his neighbours, a man and a woman&#146;. This served to confirm Butterfield's suspicions about the Osbornes. It was decided that the community should consider their guilt at a witch swimming, a popular trial introduced in England in the early seventeenth century and which continued after the repeal of the statutes against witchcraft in 1736.<br>
<br>The swimming of Ruth Osborne and her husband was well planned. The town criers of three neighbouring towns, Winslow, Leighton Buzzard, and Hemel Hempstead, announced that a man and a woman were to be &#145;publickly duck'd at Tring&#146; on 22 April. Tring's overseer of the poor, Matthew Barton, knew the Osbornes and lodged them in the town's workhouse for protection. However, in the expectation of serious trouble on the day the workhouse master, Jonathan Tomkins, had them removed to the vestry of the church. His fears were confirmed as a frustrated mob, estimated to be several thousand strong, began to demolish the workhouse and threatened to burn it down if the Osbornes were not handed over. Tomkins gave in and Ruth and her husband were escorted out of town by the mob to a pool at Long Marston, near Gubblecote. There Ruth was partially stripped, her thumbs tied to her toes, and a rope placed under her armpits, before she was thrown into the water. According to the custom of witch swimming she would be judged guilty if she floated and innocent if she sank. She floated, and to confirm this outcome Thomas Colley pushed her under several times with a stick. Ruth Osborne died minutes after being dragged back on to the bank having &#145;been suffocated with Water and Mud&#146;. Though not the last person to undergo this trial, Osborne was the last person in England to die as a result. Thomas Colley was subsequently hanged for his part in her death.<br>
