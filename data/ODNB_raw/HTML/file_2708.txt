</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bloxam,  Matthew Holbeche</span>  (1805&#150;1888), <span class="occ">architectural historian</span>, was born at midnight on 12 May 1805 in a boarding-house at the corner of Lawrence Sheriff Street and Sheep Street, Rugby, opposite Rugby School, where his father was an assistant master. Matt, as he was known, was the eighth of the ten children of Richard Rouse Bloxam (1765&#150;1840), later rector of Brinklow and vicar of Bulkington, Warwickshire, and his wife, Anne Lawrence (1767&#150;1835), sister of the painter Sir Thomas Lawrence. All six Bloxam boys became foundationers at Rugby School, Matt joining in the second term of 1813 at the age of eight, and leaving in 1821 after an undistinguished academic career to become articled to George Harris, a Rugby solicitor. In 1827 he travelled to London to be admitted to practice in the courts of law and equity. During his subsequent long career as a solicitor in Rugby, Bloxam held several local offices: he was clerk of the Rugby petty sessions from 1831 to 1871, sometimes officiated as deputy registrar of the county court, was a member of the local board from 1855 to 1863, and audited the Rugby Union accounts from 1836 until the appointment of district auditors.<br>
<br>However, as Bloxam himself admitted, although the legal profession assured his financial stability, his passions lay elsewhere. From an early age he had been fascinated by archaeology, a pursuit probably fostered by his father, and as a clerk he visited countless churches and found the time to read John Carter's antiquarian articles in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. A natural talent for draughtsmanship (which could be attributed to his maternal side) allowed him to record the visual details of buildings, which, together with his methodical character, discriminative observation, and prodigious memory for detail, combined to produce an ideal antiquary. His first book, <span class="italic">The Principles of Gothic Architecture</span>, was published in 1829, a slim volume of seventy-nine pages, presented in question and answer form. Under the title <span class="italic">The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture</span> the book was added to and improved in subsequent editions and the catechetical arrangement was replaced by narrative. Sir George Gilbert Scott persuaded Bloxam to publish the eleventh, final, and definitive version in 1882, consisting of three volumes concerning the development of Gothic architecture, the internal arrangement of churches prior to and following the Reformation, and a <span class="italic">Companion</span> volume addressing the subject of church vestments. A copy of this edition was presented to Cardinal Newman by Bloxam's younger brother, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2707/', "Revd John Rouse Bloxam (1807&#150;1891)")</script>. The popularity of the book, of which 17,000 copies had been sold before the 1882 publication, was due to its pocket size, cheapness, clear, concise, and comprehensive text, and good woodcut illustrations, the latter being the work of Thomas Orlando Sheldon Jewitt (1799&#150;1869), based on his own and Bloxam's drawings.<br>
<br>In 1834 <span class="italic">A glimpse at the monumental architecture and sculpture of Great Britain, from the earliest period to the eighteenth century</span> was published, and read by Thomas Rickman (1776&#150;1841), who felt compelled to write to Bloxam personally requesting the removal of &#145;the very puzzling and absurd term <i>Florid</i> in speaking of the latest gothic work&#146;  (Payne Smith, xxvii). Although Bloxam perhaps complicated matters by introducing transitional categories of architectural style, his works are eminently readable, factual, informative, well structured, and certainly less opinionated than those of many of his contemporaries. Bloxam also wrote about 200 articles, based on his knowledge of over 1000 churches and his particular interest in effigies and costume. These appeared in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Rugby Almanack</span>, and numerous architectural and archaeological society transactions and periodicals.<br>
<br>A member of the Oxford Architectural Society, and honorary member of the Ecclesiological Society, Bloxam was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1863, and belonged to many regional associations. His advice on ecclesiastical architectural matters was frequently sought and freely given.<br>
<br>Identifying closely with Rugby, Bloxam became the historian of both town and school. His writings on the latter were collated by W. H. Payne Smith and published posthumously as <span class="italic">Rugby: the School and the Neighbourhood</span> (1889). Bloxam regularly attended the Sunday afternoon chapel services, gave athletics prizes for the younger boys, presented gifts annually on the occasion of his birthday, read papers to the Natural History Society, contributed articles to the school magazines <span class="italic">Meteor</span> and <span class="italic">Leaflet</span>, and encouraged any boys who evinced interest in archaeology. He bequeathed his library of rare books and manuscripts and his collection of antiquities to the school.<br>
<br>Described in an obituary as &#145;the most amiable and, at the same time, the most modest of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 387), photographs portray Bloxam as a studious-looking individual with small round-rimmed glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, the long face accentuated by a high, domed forehead and Piccadilly weepers. In 1843 Bloxam built himself a three-storey house with basement in St Matthew's Place, within sight of Rugby School, and lived there with his unmarried sister Mary Isabella until his death. The only idiosyncrasy in this practical, spacious, yet unpretentious house was a fourth-storey turret from which Bloxam probably studied the stars through his Dolland telescope.<br>
<br>Scrupulous in his search for truth, Bloxam had no qualms in demystifying popular legends. He asserted that Godiva's nude canter through Coventry was pure invention, and told a dismayed audience at Lutterworth that their objects of veneration associated with John Wyclif were fakes. It is therefore surprising that, without bothering to corroborate his facts, he perpetuated the myth that the game of rugby originated with William Webb Ellis handling the ball during a Rugby School match in 1823. Correspondence in <span class="italic">The Standard</span> in 1876 concerning the interest in rugby football initially prompted Bloxam to declare that the game was entirely different when he left the school in 1821. However, probably influenced by fellow Rugbeians and pride in his alma mater, he retracted the statement, having &#145;ascertained&#146; that a foundationer had run with the ball, and by 1880 was successfully embellishing his story with authentic detail.<br>
<br>Bloxam never married. He enjoyed a healthy constitution until weakened by bronchitis late in 1887. On 18 January and 5 March 1888 he suffered paralytic seizures and died on 24 April in his home town. Rugby School and the parish church lowered their flags to half-mast, tradesmen closed their shops, and blinds were drawn in most homes on Friday 27 April 1888 when Bloxam was buried, at his own request, near a yew tree in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, Brownsover, near Rugby.<br>
