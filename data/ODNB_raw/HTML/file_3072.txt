<span class="headword">Bowles,  William</span>  (1705&#150;1780), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born in a village near Cork. He was destined for the legal profession but gave it up, and in 1740 went to Paris, where he studied natural history, chemistry, and metallurgy. He subsequently travelled through France, investigating its natural history and mineral and other productions. In 1752 he became acquainted with Don Antonio de Ulloa, afterwards admiral of the Spanish fleet, who persuaded him to enter the Spanish service; Bowles was appointed to superintend the state mines and to form a collection of natural history and establish a chemical laboratory. He first visited the mercury mines of Almaden, which had been seriously damaged by fire but which were successfully brought back into service using his plans. He afterwards travelled through Spain, investigating and collecting specimens of its minerals and natural history, living mainly at Madrid and Bilbao. He married the German Anna Regina Rustein de Clausthal Hartz Hansen, who was pensioned by the king of Spain after her husband's death. Bowles is described as tall and fine-looking, generous, honourable, active, ingenious, and well informed. From at least 1777 he was infirm and confined to his bed. He died at Madrid on 25 August 1780 and was buried in the parish church of San Martin in that city, being an ardent Roman Catholic.<br>
<br>Bowles's principal work was <span class="italic">Introduccion a la historia natural y a la geografia fisica de Espa&ntilde;a</span> (1775). It is not systematically arranged, but has very considerable value as being the first work of its kind. He was an acute observer and Irish naturalists have found particularly interesting his comparisons of the two countries' flora and fauna (Lusitania and the south-west of Ireland have very similar flora and fauna, a vestige of preglacial connections). Others, too, long found value in his work: the United States Entomological Commission reprinted in 1880 his observations on locusts which had ravaged crops in Spain as in the USA. The second edition of the <span class="italic">Introduccion</span> (1782) was edited by Don Jose Nicolas de Azara y Perera (1730/31&#150;1804), who helped the author prepare the first edition. It was translated into French by vicomte de Flavigny (1776). An Italian edition, much enlarged by Azara, then Spanish ambassador at Rome, was published in two volumes at Parma in 1784. A microfiche edition was published as late as 1994 and a paper edition in 1982. Bowles was also the author of &#145;A brief account of the Spanish and German mines&#146; published in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (56), and of a letter on the sheep of Spain and other Spanish topics, originally sent to the botanist Peter Collinson and later published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 34, 1764, 203&#150;6; 206&#150;70). He continued his work on sheep in a volume on merino sheep published in Spanish and English (1811). Sir John Thomas Dillon's <span class="italic">Travels through Spain</span> (1781) is very largely an adaptation of Bowles's first work. Ruiz and Pavon called a genus of Peruvian plants <i>Bowlesia</i> in his honour.<br>
