<span class="headword">Murphy,  John Thomas</span>  (1888&#150;1965), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was born at 235 Gorton Lane, Gorton, Manchester, on 9 December 1888, the son of John Murphy, a blacksmith's striker in an iron foundry, and Sarah Pratt. His father was an Irish Catholic and his mother an English Baptist; Murphy himself was a Primitive Methodist in his teens. He left Wincobank council school, Sheffield, at the age of thirteen to take up an apprenticeship at Vickers' Brightside engineering works in Sheffield, where he became a lathe turner. His studious capabilities were turned away from trying to enter the civil service towards reading revolutionary literature, and he became a militant shop steward highly influenced by syndicalist ideas. During the First World War, after leading a remarkably successful illegal strike by 12,000 Sheffield workers, Murphy encouraged the co-ordination of stewards' organization across the city's munitions factories into a Sheffield Workers' Committee. By 1917 he had become a recognized leader of the national Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committee movement, which had sprung up within the engineering industry.<br>
<br>J. T. Murphy was a prolific writer in <span class="italic">Solidarity</span>, the paper of the wartime stewards' movement, and his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Workers' Committee</span> (1917), became the chief theoretical statement to emerge from the movement. The pamphlet, which developed and expounded the novel theory of independent rank-and-file organization capable of fighting independently of the union leadership wherever necessary, represented an important development on the strategy of pre-war syndicalism. After the war Murphy, profoundly influenced by the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, helped to draw out the full revolutionary implications of the stewards' militant wartime activities, and conceived the workers' committees as embryonic soviets, the institutional form through which the working class could take control of society.<br>
<br>Murphy subsequently made a significant contribution to the formation and early development of British communism. After joining the syndicalist-inclined Socialist Labour Party (SLP) in 1917, he stood as an SLP parliamentary candidate in the general election of 1918, and then helped forge negotiations for the merger of the various small Marxist groups into a united British Communist Party. In 1920 he went as a shop stewards' delegate to the Second Congress of the Communist International in Moscow, where he completely embraced the Bolshevik notion of a revolutionary party capable of leading the working class to power. His abilities were soon recognized by the Russian leaders and, after helping to launch the Red International of Labour Unions, he became a member of the presidium of the executive committee of the Communist International based in Moscow between 1926 and 1928 (during which he was given the &#145;honour&#146; of moving Trotsky's expulsion from the Comintern). On 18 January 1921 he married Ethel (Molly) Morris (1890&#150;1964), who was a full-time organizer of the Women's Social and Political Union in Sheffield and later a nurse for the wounded Spanish republican soldiers on the civil war battlefront around Madrid. They had one son.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and early 1930s Murphy also served as a leading full-time central committee member of the British Communist Party, with responsibility for the party's industrial activities, and as editor of <span class="italic">Communist Review</span>. One of the most gifted of his generation of self-educated intellectuals within the leadership of British communism, Murphy made a distinctive theoretical contribution to a number of controversial trade union and political debates in a series of articles for various journals. However, his loyal and unquestioning attachment to the defence of the USSR and the rising Stalinist bureaucracy was to affect profoundly his independent political judgement and distort his revolutionary socialist politics. It led him to support every twist and turn of Stalinist policy inside Britain, including in the late 1920s the adoption of an ultra-left stance, denouncing the Labour Party as &#145;social fascist&#146;. Ironically, in 1932 Murphy was expelled (after his resignation was ruled &#145;impermissible&#146;) from the Communist Party over his support for a campaign for trade credits to be granted to the USSR, and he became a strong critic of the organization he had helped to construct. After a spell as the general secretary of the Socialist League, a left-wing ginger group inside the Labour Party, he went on to campaign for a &#145;people's front&#146; alliance against the threat posed by Nazi Germany and in support of the allied effort during the Second World War.<br>
<br>J. T. Murphy died at his home, 4 Broughton Gardens, Highgate, London, of a cerebral haemorrhage on 13 May 1965. His reflections on the crucial period in the history of the British working-class movement in which he played such a prominent role were recorded in <span class="italic">Preparing for Power</span> (1934) and in his autobiography, <span class="italic">New Horizons</span> (1941).<br>
