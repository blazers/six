<span class="headword">Seguier,  William</span>  (1772&#150;1843), <span class="occ">picture dealer and art functionary</span>, was born in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 9 November 1772, one of the eldest of nine children of David Seguier, dealer in pictures and prints, and his wife, Elizabeth Thwaites. The Seguiers were descended from Huguenot refugees, one of whom had reputedly made a fortune as a chocolate manufacturer in Soho; one of David's brothers was a topographical and technical printseller in St Giles's between 1777 and 1809, where he went under the name of John Seago; another, Peter, a sculptor who had been apprenticed to Richard Hayward (1728&#150;1800), appears to have practised in Rugby in the late 1780s, and to have had a son of the same name who worked from Coventry between 1816 and 1830. Both sculptors sign their monuments as &#145;Seager&#146;, which is also evidently the way in which David and William pronounced their name.<br>
<br>Like his younger brother <a href="#cosubject_25044">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, William Seguier was trained as an artist, reputedly by George Morland, and even&#151;perhaps as an engraver&#151;by William Blake. His original pictures were topographical views of London, but he may also have followed his father as a <i>pasticheur</i>: the posthumous sale of his pictures at Christies on 4 May 1844 included a work entitled <span class="italic">A Woody Scene with Trees, Near a Pool of Water</span>, &#145;admirably painted in the manner of Ruysdael&#146;. According to his nephew, it was Seguier's marriage on 17 February 1797 to a wealthy fellow Huguenot, Anne Magdalene Clowden, with whom he had several daughters, which prompted him to give up painting. No doubt her money enabled him to set up independently of his father, officially as a picture restorer, but in fact primarily as a dealer and agent, early in the new century, initially at 32 Coventry Street, but from the latter half of the 1830s, in partnership with John, at 3 Russell Court, Cleveland Row. His earliest clients included the banker&#150;collectors Henry Hope, John Dent, and Samuel Rogers, but by 1808 he was bidding at auction on behalf of one of the most prodigious buyers of the first third of the century, the commissioner of excise, George Watson (Taylor). In 1806 he was acting for Lord Grosvenor (later first marquess of Westminster) in his purchase of the Agar collection; from then on he steadily acquired a more aristocratic and influential clientele, beginning with the key figure of Sir George Beaumont, who had originally been advised by his father, but going on to act for Sir Charles Long (later Lord Farnborough), the earls of Darnley and Mulgrave, Sir Abraham Hume, Sir Robert Peel, and the duke of Wellington.<br>
<br>From about 1805&#151;with Beaumont, Grosvenor, Mulgrave, the latter's brother General Edmund Phipps, David Wilkie, John Jackson, and Benjamin Robert Haydon&#151;Seguier came to be part of a convivial group of artists and connoisseurs known to one another as &#145;the clique&#146;. Haydon's friendship has been unfortunate for Seguier's subsequent reputation, for the prickly painter convinced himself that Seguier had persuaded George IV not to buy his <span class="italic">Punch, or, May Day</span> in 1829, and his paranoia broadened this into the conviction that Seguier was the evil genius who had diverted a whole generation of connoisseurs from extending any significant patronage to contemporary British artists. Contrary to Haydon's dark imaginings, however, Seguier seems to have had no agenda of his own, but only the urge to make himself indispensable. Nor do the modest sums realized by the posthumous sales of his collections at Christies in April&#150;May 1844&#151;although his Rembrandt prints were remarkable&#151;suggest that he was venal.<br>
<br>It was Seguier's private clients who helped him to his official career. Beginning as superintendent of the newly founded British Institution in 1805, he successively and concurrently became surveyor of the king's pictures in 1820, and keeper of the new National Gallery in 1824. Haydon alleged that &#145;His King does nothing without Mr. Seguier's advice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Pope, 3.455), but this would seem to have been restricted to practical matters of the kind that George IV had consulted him on at Carlton House and Kensington Palace while prince regent. Seguier was continued in the post of surveyor by William IV and Queen Victoria, hanging and publishing a summary catalogue of George IV's pictures in the picture gallery at Buckingham Palace after his death, and, with much less success, re-hanging many of the pictures from Kensington Palace at Hampton Court. At the National Gallery, too, his duties were those of a subordinate of the trustees. Surprisingly perhaps, in view of his original profession, his interpretation of &#145;attending to the preservation of pictures&#146; never extended to anything more than surface cleaning of them. However, he did re-varnish, and mix the mastic varnish with oil, to combat &#145;blooming&#146;, thus leading to a slow but steady darkening; his brother's removal of the varnish from some pictures after Seguier's death gave rise to the first of many cleaning controversies in which the National Gallery has been embroiled. As keeper of the National Gallery, Seguier was, as his title suggests, an essentially eighteenth-century figure; in striking contrast to the <i>Kunstgeschichte</i>-inspired directorate of his ultimate successor, Sir Charles Eastlake. Seguier died on 5 November 1843 at 92 King's Road, Brighton, Sussex.<br>

<a name="cosubject_25044"></a><span class="headword">John Seguier</span>  (1785&#150;1856), younger brother and partner of William Seguier, was his successor as <span class="occ">superintendent of the British Institution</span>. Born in London in 1785 he attended the Royal Academy Schools from 1807, and he too first practised as a topographical painter; a pair of views of Watson Taylor's house in Cavendish Square was bought back by William at the Erlestoke Park sale in 1832, and <span class="italic">Excavating the Regent's Canal</span> is in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut. In his brother's lifetime he carried on the picture-restoring business, but also advised his own clients, notably Daniel Mesman (whose collection was left to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, in 1834); after William's death he continued to serve the queen and Sir Robert Peel. His son with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66815/', "Margaret Seguier")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26462/', "Stewart, Anthony (1773&#150;1846)")</script>], elder daughter of the miniature-painter Anthony Stewart and herself a miniaturist, Frederick Peter (<i>d</i>. 1902), was continued in his father's post as picture-restorer in ordinary to the queen, and compiled the idiosyncratic <span class="italic">A Critical and Commercial Dictionary of the Works of Painters</span> (1870). John Seguier died on 7 June 1856 at 1 Camden Terrace, Camden New Town.<br>
