<span class="headword">Skinner,  James</span>  (1778&#150;1841), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Bengal, was the son of Hercules Skinner (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1735), son of David Skinner, provost of Montrose from 1733 to 1743. Hercules Skinner was a Scot in the East India Company's military service, who became a lieutenant-colonel in 1800 and died at Buragaon, Bengal, on 12 July 1803. When an ensign, he had taken Jeany, the daughter of a Rajput <i>zamindar</i>, as a mistress, and they had six children, one of whom was James. She committed suicide in 1790 when her daughters were taken from her, out of purdah, and sent to a school for children of Indian and European parentage.<br>
<br>James and his younger brother Robert (<i>d</i>. 1821) were sent first to a charity school, then in 1794 to a Calcutta boarding-school; and in 1796 James was apprenticed to a printer there, but at once ran away. His godfather, Captain W. Burn, introduced him to De Boigne, the French general who was in the service of Sindhia, the Maratha chieftain, and Sindhia gave him a commission in his army. Skinner did not join the British forces because of a rule barring anyone whose mother was Indian from holding commissioned rank. During the next ten years he took part in various expeditions and forays, in which M. Perron, De Boigne's successor, was perpetually engaged, including the capture of Delhi in May 1798, and the storming of Hansi, the stronghold of George Thomas the Irish adventurer, in 1799. When the Marathas were defeated by General Gerard (afterwards Viscount) Lake in 1803, some of the sons of British officers and Indian mothers who had served the Marathas were imprisoned by the British, but Skinner was offered the command, without a commission, of a body of horsemen who had deserted the Marathas. He accepted with the understanding, it is said, that he would not have to fight his old employer, Sindhia. At the head of his irregular cavalry&#151;known as the Yellow Boys from their uniforms and soon to be famous as Skinner's Horse, a designation inherited by the 1st Bengal cavalry&#151;he distinguished himself in the campaign against Holkar (1805) and in the Pindari war (1817&#150;19). In 1825 he was present with his cavalry at the storming of Bharatpur. The Indian government rewarded him by grants of land at Hansi in the newly acquired territory, and, having purchased other properties, including a large house in Delhi, he became master of a large estate. He spent much on irrigation works, was well spoken of by government officials as a good landlord, and was respected by his tenants. Successive governors-general, from the Marquess Wellesley to the earl of Auckland, spoke of him in the highest terms; in recognition of his military services he was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the army, and created a CB (1828). In one of his early campaigns with the Marathas, when wounded and hard pressed by the enemy, he had vowed, if his life were spared, to build a Christian church. So he built, at a cost of &pound;20,000, the church of St James at Delhi. The building was consecrated by Bishop Daniel Wilson of Calcutta on 22 November 1836, and Skinner and his three sons were confirmed there on the same day.<br>
<br>Skinner lived in princely style, and his entertainments were lavish. Like Indian rulers, and some of the early British officials, he was a great patron of artists, employing them to paint portraits of his family and friends. At his parties he often gave pictures to his guests of the dancing girls that had entertained them. He also had pictures painted of the Yellow Boys, and of the many groups connected to Indian armies at the time; these valuable historical records are now in the oriental and India Office collection of the British Library.<br>
<br>The headquarters of Skinner's corps were at Hansi, and there, following attacks of fever, he died on 4 December 1841, and was buried with military honours, his remains being taken to Delhi two months afterwards and deposited in his own church. He is said to have had sixteen wives and mistresses, and left five sons: Joseph (1796?&#150;1855?); James (1805&#150;1862), a colonel in the Indian army; Hercules (1813&#150;1852), major in the Indian army; Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1864); and Alexander (1825&#150;1885). On the death of his youngest son, Alexander Skinner, who had managed the estate for some years, it was divided among Skinner's surviving descendants.<br>
