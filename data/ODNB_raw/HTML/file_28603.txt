<span class="headword">Walpole, Sir  Robert</span>  (1808&#150;1876), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of Thomas Walpole (1755&#150;1840) of Stagbury Park, Surrey, sometime British minister at Munich, and Lady Margaret (1769&#150;1854), eighth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21912/', "John Perceval, second earl of Egmont")</script>, was born on 1 December 1808. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28604/', "Spencer Horatio Walpole")</script> was his elder brother. Educated at Dr Goodenough's school at Ealing and at Eton College, Robert received a commission as ensign in the rifle brigade on 11 May 1825, and was promoted lieutenant on 26 September of the following year.<br>
<br>Walpole served during the earlier part of his career with his corps in Nova Scotia (1825&#150;36), Ireland, Birmingham during the bread riots (1839), Jersey, and Malta (1841&#150;3). He was promoted captain on 24 January 1834, major on 31 May 1844, and lieutenant-colonel on 2 July 1847, in which year he was appointed to the staff as deputy adjutant and quartermaster-general at Corfu, where he remained until 1856, having been promoted colonel in the army on 25 November 1854.<br>
<br>In 1857 Walpole went to India to take part in the suppression of the mutiny, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. He commanded the 6th brigade of the army under Sir Colin Campbell at the battle of Cawnpore on 6 December 1857, then assisted Campbell in preparations for the siege of Lucknow. During the siege, in 1858, Walpole commanded the 3rd division, comprising the 5th and 6th brigades, in a variety of skirmishes. After the capture of Lucknow he was sent in command of a division to march through Rohilkhand. He left Lucknow on 7 April, and on the 15th ineptly attacked Fort Ruiya, and was repulsed with considerable loss, although the enemy evacuated the fort the same night. Walpole's conduct of this operation was severely censured, and Malleson, in his <span class="italic">History of the Indian Mutiny</span>, not only asserted that the second in command, Brigadier Adrian Hope, who was killed in the attack, had no confidence in his chief, but that Walpole was altogether incompetent as a general in command. Walpole was not a great commander, but the strictures passed upon him were undeserved. On the occasion in question Walpole undervalued his enemy, and in consequence many valuable lives were lost; but the commander-in-chief was fully cognizant of all that took place, and, far from withdrawing from Walpole his confidence, he continued to employ him in positions of trust and in important commands during the remainder of the fighting in India. He commanded the troops under Lord Clyde at the battle of Bareilly on 5 May, when he was wounded by a sabre cut, and his horse was also wounded in three places. He commanded the Rohilkhand division from 1858 to 1860, and commanded in person at the fight of Maler Ghat on the River Sarda on 15 January 1859, when, with 360 men, 60 of whom were Europeans, he entirely defeated 2500 of the enemy and took two guns.<br>
<br>For his services in the Indian mutiny Walpole received the medal with clasp for Lucknow; he was made first a companion, and then in May 1859 a knight commander in the Order of the Bath, and he received the thanks of parliament. In 1861 he commanded the Lucknow division, but in the same year was transferred to the command of the infantry brigade at Gibraltar. He was promoted major-general on 30 May 1862, brought home in 1864 to command the Chatham military district, and selected to command at the volunteer review in 1865. He relinquished the Chatham command in 1866, was promoted lieutenant-general on 25 October 1871, and was selected for command at the autumn manoeuvres of 1872.<br>
<br>Walpole married, on 29 January 1846, Gertrude, youngest daughter of General William Henry Ford of the Royal Engineers. They had nine children. Walpole died on 12 July 1876 at his house, The Grove, West Molesey, Surrey. His wife, two sons, and three daughters survived him.<br>
