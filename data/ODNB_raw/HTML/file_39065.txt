<span class="headword">Best,  Wilhelm Philipp</span>  (1712&#150;1785), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in Hanover, but he spent most of his working life in London. After completing his studies at the University of Helmstedt, he entered the service of George II's electoral government as <i>Geheimer Kanzleisekret&auml;r extraordinarius</i> (&#145;privy chancellery secretary&#146;) in 1737. In 1746 he was posted to the Hanoverian legation in London, where he remained until about 1782, serving under five successive heads of legation. From 1770 he was styled <i>Hofrat</i> or &#145;counsellor&#146;. From the 1750s to the 1770s he lived at 6 St James's Place.<br>
<br>Probably Best's most significant contribution to Anglo-Hanoverian relations during his long residence in London was as the <i>de facto</i> intermediary or representative of the University of G&ouml;ttingen, the Hanoverian &#145;national&#146; university, founded by the electorate's leading minister, Gerlach Adolph, Freiherr von M&uuml;nchhausen (1688&#150;1770), in 1737. It was probably in December 1752 that M&uuml;nchhausen charged Best with overseeing the London side of the acquisition of books for the university's rapidly growing library. Best's surviving correspondence is one of the most important sources for the history of the library in this important early phase. By 1800 it was to become almost certainly the largest single assembly of books in the western world and an unparalleled resource for study and research. Books acquired through the London book trade formed a significant proportion of the estimated 133,200 held by the library by this date. Their presence in G&ouml;ttingen contributed in no small measure to the increasing awareness of English-language authors in central and eastern Europe.<br>
<br>Best was responsible for ensuring the smooth dispatch of G&ouml;ttingen's quarterly deliveries of books from London. They were normally sent by diplomatic courier via Harwich and Hamburg or Bremen, typically reaching G&ouml;ttingen about two months after the orders had originally been dispatched. He was able to build a firm and lasting relationship with such members of the book trade as Thomas Osborne, Davis and Reymer, or John Ridley and his successors. His close working relationship with Osborne enabled the library to build its collection retrospectively through antiquarian purchases. In a later phase, when the emphasis had shifted to current publications, Ridley proved a remarkably well-informed and reliable supplier. Best's correspondence provides important evidence for the working methods of these booksellers and for the practical arrangements for the international book trade. It also shows the energy and enthusiasm with which he carried out his tasks.<br>
<br>Apart from book orders, Best advised and assisted the University of G&ouml;ttingen and members of its faculty in a wide range of matters relating to British affairs. For example, he negotiated with the typefounder William Caslon (1692&#150;1766) over the purchase of Arabic types for the university printer and pressed the case of the astronomer Tobias Mayer (1723&#150;1762), and later his widow, in the Admiralty's competition for a practical method of determining longitude. His correspondence also supplies interesting information about his dealings with British officials and tradesmen.<br>
<br>From about 1782, when Best appears to have retired to Hanover, where he died in 1785, his role at the legation was gradually taken over by his son Georg August Best (1755&#150;1823), who had studied law at G&ouml;ttingen and returned to London as <i>Kammersekret&auml;r</i> in September 1778. Like his father, Georg Best also appears to have become quite well known in London society. In 1780 he was elected a member of the Royal Society. He remained in London during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, and the occupation of the electorate, being raised to a Hanoverian peerage in 1815. A notice of his death appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of April 1823: &#145;In Sloane-street, aged 67, Baron Best, one of his Majesty's Privy Councillors, K. C. H. and F. R. S. &amp;c.&#146;.<br>
