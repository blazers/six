<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robey, Sir  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>George Edward Wade]</span>  (1869&#150;1954), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 20 September 1869 at 334 Kennington Road, London, the elder of two sons of George Wade, civil engineer, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Keene. He also had two sisters. His father often worked on tramway installations which took him and his family to the provinces and abroad, with the result that Robey's childhood tended to be peripatetic. Although he began his education at an English dame-school, between the ages of eleven and sixteen he studied in Dresden, where he also acquired an appreciation of art and of music up to and including Wagner, though not beyond, and also in Leipzig. For a period he lodged with a clergyman's family, eventually, it is claimed, becoming fluent in the language. He never lost his love of German or of Germany, despite remaining the most patriotic of Englishmen.<br>
<br>Back in England, Wade was guided by his father into a clerical post with a Birmingham tramway construction business. Boredom with office routine led him to take up football, a game at which he excelled, and to sing comic songs with like-minded amateurs at smoking concerts and charity shows. Soon he realized that winning the applause of an audience was the most exciting and gratifying activity he had ever known. He went back to London in 1891, and, although prudently retaining an office job, began to earn the occasional guinea as an entertainer at evening functions. To save his family embarrassment he adopted the stage name of Robey. It was based on Roby, the name of a Birmingham firm: when he saw it misprinted as Robey he so liked the look of it that he took it as his own.<br>
<br>After serving an apprenticeship as stooge to a theatre hypnotist George Robey made his professional d&eacute;but in July 1891 at the old Oxford Music-Hall in Oxford Street. His patter and songs were well received and earned him a twelve-month engagement. Within a short time he achieved equal billing with famous names such as Dan Leno and Marie Lloyd. Gifted with a strong constitution, teeming energy, and supreme self-confidence, he revelled in the exhausting routine of playing five music-halls a night, dashing from one to the other in a strict timetable that allowed him only a few seconds to adjust his make-up in the wings. He had by now perfected the costume that became his trademark: a bald-fronted wig, a red nose, and naturally prominent eyebrows heavily blacked, accompanied by a small flat bowler hat, a shapeless crumpled soutane without collar, and a short flexible cane. The effect was of a dissolute, unfrocked clergyman. He flew on stage in a tremendous hurry and his lightning attack was such that the audience fell under his control before he even spoke a word. His method was to wind them up with a sort of ratchet technique, hinting at the most outrageous things and daring his hearers to imagine the worst, but then, at the last minute, relenting and leaving the worst unspoken. It was the procedure later employed by such as Max Miller and Frankie Howerd. &#145;Desist!&#146;, he would sternly command, arching his famous eyebrows as the first peal of laughter broke out: &#145;Kindly temper your hilarity with a modicum of reserve.&#146; Having again convulsed the audience with another flood of possible double meanings, he would raise an admonitory finger and intone: &#145;Let there be merriment by all means, but let it be tempered with dignity and the reserve which is compatible with the obvious refinement of our environment.&#146; The threat of obscenity was dissipated in a flow of polysyllabic orotundity which he would puncture, &#145;in other words&#146;, to quote one of his catch-phrases, with an abrupt descent into everyday slang.<br>
<br>Robey wrote his own patter, although the songs by other hands that were so closely identified with him have not survived, apart from &#145;If you were the only girl in the world&#146;. Ironically enough in later life, despite the boisterous double meanings of his own patter, he often criticized other performers for using what he righteously called &#145;smut&#146;. He distinguished this from what he preferred to term as his own brand of &#145;honest vulgarity&#146;. &#145;Honest vulgarity&#146;, he declared in his second autobiography, <span class="italic">Looking Back on Life</span>, &#145;never did a man any harm in the world, and never will &hellip; Honest vulgarity is neither filth nor prudery&#146;  (G. Robey, <span class="italic">Looking Back</span>, 118&#150;20). Gramophone records and existing film of his act testify to his crystal clear enunciation, that &#145;whiplash diction&#146;, in Laurence Olivier's admiring phrase  (Harding, 158), which carried every nuance to the target Robey described as &#145;the last man in the gallery&#146;  (G. Robey, <span class="italic">Looking Back</span>, 70). As the years passed he added to his repertory many humorous character studies, including &#145;The Mayor of Mudcumdyke&#146;, which he gave at the first royal command music-hall performance in 1912. For more than forty years he starred as an uproarious pantomime dame, generally agreed to be the best of his generation. In 1937, at the age of sixty-eight, he featured in a non-stop revue at the Prince of Wales Theatre, still fresh as a daisy after giving sixteen performances of his act each day.<br>
<br>When the golden age of music-hall began to fade the versatile Robey went into revue with <span class="italic">The Bing Boys are Here</span> (1916), where he sang with Violet Loraine &#145;If you were the only girl in the world&#146;, with which he became for ever associated. He adapted brilliantly to the demands of operetta in <span class="italic">Helen!</span> (1932), C. B. Cochran's lavish reworking of Offenbach. His most ambitious experiment was in 1935 when he played Falstaff in <span class="italic">Henry IV, Part 1</span>. The production, by Sydney Carroll at His Majesty's Theatre, also featured John Drinkwater in the title-role, Lewis Casson as Owen Glendower, and Lady Tree as Mistress Quickly. Despite his occasional trouble with lines and echoes of the stand-up comedian, the critics were in general impressed. &#145;He has the authentic geniality of the old fribble&#146;, declared James Agate  (Agate, 102). In 1944 he played Falstaff on his deathbed in a scene added by Laurence Olivier to the film <span class="italic">Henry V</span>. He made a number of silent films which are apparently lost, and several unremarkable sound films. His most interesting film was <span class="italic">Don Quichotte</span> (1934), in which he played Sancho Panza to Chalyapin's Don Quixote under the notable direction of G. W. Pabst.<br>
<br>Although the Prime Minister of Mirth, as he was usually billed, presented a disreputable and anarchic figure on stage, Robey in his private life was highly conventional and held right-wing political opinions. Though he dearly loved a lord, however, he was not a snob. He taught himself to become a connoisseur and shrewd collector of Chinese porcelain, netsuke, and Japanese antiquities. Other interests included Egyptology, oriental art, and comparative religions. As an accomplished watercolourist he exhibited at the Royal Academy. He also made violins. At the same time he was an energetic footballer, making guest appearances with professional teams such as Chelsea and Aston Villa. Cricket, in which he once played against W. G. Grace, was another passion, as were athletics, rugby, boxing, tennis, and, in old age, golf. Made CBE (1919) in recognition of the vast sums he raised for wartime charities, he was knighted in 1954, the last year of his life.<br>
<br>Robey had married, on 29 April 1898, the Australian actress Ethel Haydon (<i>c</i>.1877&#150;1954); they had two children. His son, Edward George (<i>b</i>. 1900), was later a barrister and prosecuting counsel who achieved seventy-four death sentences, subsequently becoming a stipendiary magistrate. His daughter, Eileen, had gifts as a portrait painter. The marriage withered away over the years and Robey was officially divorced in 1938. &#145;Women were his one weakness&#146;, Robey's son commented, &#145;almost one might say an obsession&#146;  (E. Robey, 31). At the age of sixty, however, wearied of philandering, Robey fell deeply in love with Blanche Littler (<i>b</i>. 1899), a member of the well-known theatrical family, who was thirty years younger. She responded with a fierce and loyal devotion, managed all his business affairs, organized every aspect of his life, and nursed him tenderly at the end. They married on 30 November 1938. Robey retired, reluctantly, in 1948, moving first to Hove and then to nearby Saltdean, Sussex, where he died on 29 November 1954. His funeral and cremation took place at Downs crematorium, Brighton, two days later.<br>
