<span class="headword">Boyd, Sir  Robert Lewis Fullarton</span>  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physicist and engineer</span>, was born on 19 October 1922 at 5 Melbourne Terrace, Saltcoats, Ayrshire, the elder of twin sons of William John Boyd, a works chemist, and his wife, Dorothy Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sibthorpe. Two years after his birth the family moved to Croydon, where his father became head of science at Croydon Polytechnic and two sisters were born. Young Robert's interest in science and technical gadgetry was in early evidence, and he gained local fame by building a petrol engine, using the lathe in the school workshop. He won a state bursary (as did his brother) to study engineering at Imperial College from 1941. After graduating in 1943 he was recruited by the Admiralty to work on the effects of shock and vibration on naval stores, especially mines and their delicate components. As was often the case in those wartime science &#145;hot houses&#146;, several long-lasting scientific links were formed. Among Boyd's scientific colleagues were David Bates, Francis Crick, and Harrie Massey. The contact with Massey was to prove the most durable and important in Boyd's subsequent career, and had a strong influence on the emergence of space research in the UK.<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Massey returned to his position as Goldsmid professor of mathematics at University College, London (UCL). As he began to rebuild the mathematics department Boyd was an early recruit, hired on a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research grant to study the properties of ionized gases, research which led to the award of a doctorate in 1949. On 6 September the same year, at the Rebecca Street Meeting Room, Bradford, he married Mary Higgins (<i>d</i>. 1996), a 29-year-old schoolteacher from Bradford, and daughter of John Higgins. They enjoyed a long and happy marriage, and had a daughter, Hazel, and two sons, Robert and Stephen. In 1951 Massey was appointed Quain professor and head of physics at UCL, taking Boyd, now an ICI research fellow, to the physics department with him. In 1952 Boyd was appointed to a lectureship. Over the next quarter of a century Massey was to lead one of the strongest university physics departments in the country.<br>
<br>A central research theme in the department was the study of atomic and ionic collisions; that led naturally to a keen interest in the prospects offered by the development of high altitude rockets to study directly the chemistry and physics of the earth's upper atmosphere. The critical opportunity arrived in 1953 when Massey, then chairman of the Royal Society Gassiot committee on atmospheric research, was called by the Ministry of Supply to ask if any scientific use could be made of the solid fuel rockets they had been developing (for military purposes). Massey immediately invited Boyd to take a lead role in exploring that option, which Boyd's scientific and technological expertise made him well equipped to do. Vacation work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, followed for Boyd, while Massey enlarged the potential academic research base to include groups led by David Bates at Queen's University, Belfast, Granville Beynon in Aberystwyth, Jim Sayers at Birmingham, and Peter Sheppard at Imperial College. Things moved quickly, with the forthcoming International Geophysical Year (1957/8) as a focus for scientists worldwide. In 1955 the UK Treasury agreed to a Royal Society bid for &pound;100,000, part for the Royal Aircraft Establishment to develop a new high altitude rocket, and part to fund university groups to develop suitable experiments. A rocket research group was set up by Boyd at UCL. The first Skylark launches took place from Woomera in South Australia in 1957. Seven further Skylarks were flown in 1958 and the UK space research programme was up and running. Boyd's increasing national and international stature was rewarded at UCL with promotion to reader in 1959 and then to professor of physics in 1962.<br>
<br>The launch of the Russian Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite, on 4 October 1957 thrust space research into the headlines around the world, and science was a substantial beneficiary. Besides the superpowers (the USA and the Soviet Union) the UK was perhaps the most significant early participant in space science, with Boyd and other university group leaders playing leading roles in collaborations with NASA and building the basis for a European programme through the new European Space Research Organisation (ESRO). Milestones were the first UK&#150;US scientific satellite, Ariel 1 (launched in April 1962), and the first ESRO satellite, ESRO-2 (launched in May 1968). Both satellites were designed to study the interaction between the sun and the upper atmosphere, and Boyd's group at UCL played a key role. Typical of the technical ingenuity and scientific insight of Boyd's team was a modified Langmuir probe which measured the concentration of both electrons and positive ions, and the electron temperature, along the satellite orbit. Comparison with simultaneous measurements of solar X-radiation provided some of the first detailed information on the effects of &#145;solar weather&#146; on the terrestrial atmosphere.<br>
<br>Nationally the academic base of space science was growing, with research groups at more than a dozen universities. UCL had the largest programme, but its success brought with it a severe problem of accommodation on the Gower Street site. Fortunately the scientific and technological reputation of Boyd's team persuaded the Mullard Company to donate a sufficient sum to enable UCL to purchase a country mansion at Holmbury St Mary in Surrey; in 1967 the Mullard Space Science Laboratory was opened, with Boyd as its first director. As a research group leader Boyd had high standards, and was demanding but fair. He was very loyal to his staff and students, many of whom went on to occupy senior positions in space research across the world. His students were given freedom to initiate and to make mistakes, but always within the constraints of a well-managed programme. He was generous in sharing credit with his team, as can be seen in his extensive scientific bibliography, with first authorship spread among senior and more junior colleagues. Along with many scientific papers he wrote a number of books, notably <span class="italic">The Upper Atmosphere</span> (with Massey, 1958), <span class="italic">Space Research by Rockets and Satellites</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">Space Physics</span> (1975).<br>
<br>Boyd's expertise and wise counsel meant that he was often in demand, and he gave his time generously, being a member of the council of the Royal Astronomical Society (1962&#150;6), serving on Ministry of Defence committees on astronautics (1974&#150;7) and serving on its committee on meteorology (1972&#150;5), acting as adviser to the BBC on science programmes (1973&#150;8), and&#151;most importantly&#151;arguing the case for space science as a member of the Science Research Council (1977&#150;81) and of its various advisory bodies over a lengthy period. Later on he served as a trustee of the National Maritime Museum (1980&#150;89). Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1969, he was appointed CBE in 1972 and knighted on his retirement in 1983.<br>
<br>While an outstanding scientist Boyd was at heart an engineer. Throughout his professional career it was possible to discern his passion and gift for technical solutions. The enthusiasm of the schoolboy in his home workshop evidently continued into adulthood; it was, for instance, widely alleged that he had developed a new design of electric washing machine. His major interest in retirement again reflected his lifelong passion for technology and design, buying and refurbishing classical cars and accumulating a small fleet of Bentley and Rolls-Royce vehicles.<br>
<br>Robert Boyd was a key figure in establishing space science as a strong scientific discipline in the UK. An outstanding physicist and gifted engineer, he gained the respect of peers across the world. Throughout his life he remained a devout Christian, having been brought up in the Brethren and eventually being confirmed in the Church of England in 1995; his faith and commitment to scientific study co-existed without conflict. Following the death of his first wife in 1996, on 24 April 1998 he married Betty Robinson, a seventy-year-old retired educational social worker and widow, daughter of Herbert Frank Chelmsford, caterer. He died at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, on 5 February 2004, from heart failure after a fall.<br>
