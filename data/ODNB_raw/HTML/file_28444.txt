<span class="headword">Waldegrave,  William</span>, first Baron Radstock  (1753&#150;1825), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 9 July 1753 in Kensington, London, second of the two sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28439/', "John Waldegrave, third Earl Waldegrave (1718&#150;1784)")</script>, general and MP [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28438/', "Waldegrave, James, second Earl Waldegrave")</script>], and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower (1724&#150;1784), daughter of the first Earl Gower and Evelyn Pierrepoint. On 17 May 1766, after seven years at Eton College (1759&#150;65), he joined the <i>Jersey</i> (60 guns), flagship of Commodore Richard Spry, commander-in-chief, Mediterranean. Waldegrave's three years in her were broken by nine months' leave in England. He returned home in the <i>Dorsetshire</i> (70 guns) and in August 1769 sailed in the frigate <i>Quebec</i> (Captain Francis Reynolds) for the West Indies where he served for three years, including a year in the sloop <i>Spy</i> and eight months in the <i>Montagu</i> (60 guns), flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Man; in her he returned home as a lieutenant (promoted 1 August 1772). In January 1773 he joined the <i>Portland</i> (50 guns), and sailed again for the West Indies where he transferred to <i>Princess Amelia</i> (80 guns), before returning to England in September.<br>
<br>In March 1774 Waldegrave was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Medway</i> (60 guns), Mediterranean flagship of Rear-Admiral Man who promoted him to commander on 23 June 1775 with command of the sloop <i>Zephyr</i>. Less than a year later he was promoted captain (30 May 1776) and in August assumed command of the <i>Rippon</i> (60 guns). Despite his mother's instruction to Lord Sandwich that her son should not be sent to the East Indies, Waldegrave sailed for that destination in September in the <i>Rippon</i>, flagship of the commander-in-chief, Commodore Sir Edward Vernon. After fifteen months Waldegrave's health broke down, obliging him to return home.<br>
<br>Waldegrave commissioned the frigate <i>Pomona</i> in September 1778, sailed for the West Indies, and in January 1779 captured the <i>Cumberland</i>, a large and troublesome American privateer, and four other prizes before transferring in June to the larger frigate <i>La Prudente</i> and returning to England. In July 1780 <i>La Prudente</i>, belatedly assisted by the frigate <i>Licorne</i>, captured the large French frigate <i>Capricieuse</i> after a four-hour battle in the Bay of Biscay, taking over 200 prisoners of war; so shattered was the <i>Capricieuse</i> after her gallant resistance that Waldegrave was obliged to burn her. In April 1781 <i>La Prudente</i> was at Admiral Darby's relief of Gibraltar&#151;&#145;Waldegrave is a very attentive good officer&#146;  (Darby to Sandwich, 20 June 1781, Barnes and Owen, 4.46)&#151;and in December he was at the capture by a squadron under Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt of twenty sail of a French convoy in the Bay of Biscay. In March 1782 Waldegrave transferred to the frigate <i>Phaeton</i>, in Howe's fleet which in October again relieved Gibraltar.<br>
<br>Waldegrave paid off the <i>Phaeton</i> at the peace in April 1783 and was unemployed until 1790. He travelled widely for his health, and at Smyrna on 28 December 1785 he married Cornelia Jacoba (1762/3&#150;1839), daughter of David Van Lennep, chief of the Dutch factory. They had three sons (two of them became naval officers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28435/', "George Granville Waldegrave, second Baron Radstock")</script>) and four daughters. He returned to England in 1786 and commanded the <i>Majestic</i> (74 guns) for three weeks during the Spanish armament of 1790.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1793 Waldegrave commissioned the <i>Courageux</i> (74 guns) and sailed to the Mediterranean. After the occupation of Toulon that August Lord Hood sent him home with dispatches, travelling by frigate to Barcelona, overland to Corunna, and by sea to Falmouth. He rejoined the fleet via the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy with orders for Hood. After promotion to rear-admiral on 4 July 1794 he returned home and from May 1795 commanded a small squadron in the channel. On 1 June 1795 he was promoted vice-admiral and in November he returned to the Mediterranean in the <i>Barfleur</i> (98 guns) to join the fleet under Sir John Jervis (later earl of St Vincent) whom he did not please: &#145;Vice-Admiral Waldegrave is so very troublesome to me&#146;, Jervis wrote to the first lord, &#145;that I must request Your Lordship to remove him to some other service&#146;  (letter of 29 July 1796, Corbett, 2.43). Nevertheless Waldegrave remained to take part, as third in command, at the battle of Cape St Vincent on St Valentine's day 1797. The second and fourth in command were made baronets, an honour Waldegrave declined, the rank being junior to his own as the son of an earl.<br>
<br>Waldegrave returned to England in April 1797 before embarking for Newfoundland where for the next three years he was governor and commander-in-chief and, according to an early history of the colony, he &#145;rendered his administration remarkable by his zeal for the public welfare&#146;  (Bonnycastle, 1.138&#150;9). On 27 December 1800 Waldegrave was created Baron Radstock in the Irish peerage; he was promoted admiral on 29 April 1802, but had no further employment. On 2 January 1815 he was created GCB. His speedy promotion to flag-rank in twenty-eight years compared with, say, Collingwood (thirty-eight years) illustrates the advantage of influence as an earl's son.<br>
<br>Waldegrave died of apoplexy in Portland Place, London, on 20 August 1825. He was buried on 26 August in Navestock church, Essex, where there is a memorial to him with a portrayal of his gold medal for Cape St Vincent.<br>
<br>Not only the earl of St Vincent found Radstock difficult. Barham when first lord found him &#145;unreasonable&#146; when seeking an appointment for his son  (letter to Lord Collingwood, 12 Dec 1805, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers of &hellip; Barham</span>, 3.348); and one of his officers in the <i>Barfleur</i> remarked on his &#145;very distant manner to the officers of the ship who were not desirous of the day of invitation to his table&#146;  (letter of 13 Jan 1803, Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 5.1960).<br>
