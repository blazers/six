<span class="headword">Kendall,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1501), <span class="occ">administrator and prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, probably born into a Norfolk or Yorkshire family, entered the order of the knights of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem at an early age. He began his career in the convent on Rhodes where he was retained by the master until May 1465. In 1466&#150;7 he acted as proctor of the English tongue (the English brethren in the convent) at the order's chapter general at Rome. After the chapter he returned to Rhodes where he ran into unknown difficulties, but on 21 August 1474 he was in Westminster, when Brother Robert Multon, who was afterwards replaced, was presented to Edward IV as the new prior of England. Kendall returned again to Rhodes where on 28 April 1477 he was elected turcopolier, that is conventual bailiff, and commander of the lighter mercenary troops. On 7 November 1478, during a general chapter on Rhodes, he also became proctor-general at the Roman curia, and on 20 January 1479 he was named proctor and lieutenant of the master, Pierre d'Aubusson, of the convent and treasury for Italy, Burgundy, the Netherlands, England, and Ireland. Probably from mid-1479 onwards he took up residence at Rome. When Rhodes was besieged by the Ottomans in 1480, he had to gather men and money from the West, which suggests that he was not on the island during the siege. Again in Westminster on 29 and 30 April 1480, Kendall gained royal protection for the order and two letters of recommendation (one for a visit to Ireland). In England he also sold indulgences, including one for Dame Joan Plumpton. He was in Rome on 6 May 1484 when he was granted by Sixtus IV the first year's fruits of the order's benefices in England for the rearmament of the English part of the city walls and for the rebuilding of the house of the English tongue in Rhodes (on which Kendall's arms were probably still to be found in 1826), and in 1485 he was a member of the order's legation to the new pope, Innocent VIII.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1489 Kendall was elected prior of England and resigned the office of turcopolier. In August 1490 he was allowed to leave Rome for England, and on 1 March 1491&#151;as a sign of their deep personal relationship&#151;the pope made him a member of his own family, the Cib&ograve; of Genoa, and took him under papal protection. On 5 January 1492 Kendall was pardoned by Henry VII for having acted as prior of England without royal permission, and afterwards became involved in English politics. In June 1492 he took part in peace negotiations with France, in February 1496 he was one of the envoys to Archduke Philip, the son of Maximilian I, and in June 1500 he accompanied Henry VII to a meeting with Philip in Calais. In September 1492 and in June 1496 he is mentioned as justice of the peace for Essex (and Middlesex), in June 1497 he was one of the commissioners to inquire concerning insurrections in Cornwall and elsewhere, and in November 1499 he participated in a grand jury that found Edward, earl of Warwick, one of the heirs presumptive of Richard III, guilty of high treason. It seems that Kendall remained in the king's favour throughout (obtaining a general pardon on 18 June 1496), though in March 1496 he had been accused of having sided with another of the Yorkist pretenders, Perkin Warbeck. Kendall remained prior of England until his death which occurred between 20 January and 6 April 1501. The lease-book from his administration of the hospitaller houses in England survives (BL, MS Lansdowne 200). Although he was probably not on Rhodes during the siege, he was honoured by a contemporary Italian medal (now in the British Museum). It bears a bust on one side and his arms on the other with the inscriptions &#145;Io. Kendal Rhodi Tvrcvpellerivs&#146; and, on the obverse, &#145;Tempore Obsidionis Tvrchorvm <span class="smallcap">MCCCCLXXX</span>&#146; (&#145;at the time of the siege [of Rhodes] by the Turks, 1480&#146;).<br>
