<span class="headword">Chaloner,  Edward</span>  (1590/91&#150;1625), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Chiswick, Middlesex, the second of the four surviving sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5041/', "Sir Thomas Chaloner (1563/4&#150;1615)")</script>, naturalist and courtier, and his first wife, Elizabeth (1568&#150;1603), daughter of William Fleetwood, recorder of London. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 22 February 1605 and graduated BA on 8 July 1607, proceeding MA on 15 May 1610. On the occasion of the visit to Magdalen in August 1605 of Prince Henry (Chaloner's father was the young prince's tutor) he was among several undergraduates who took part in disputations before the prince, and later it was Chaloner who, in the name of the college, presented him with two pairs of gloves. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College in 1611, graduated BD on 30 May 1617, and was created DD on 6 November 1619.<br>
<br>By this time Chaloner had already risen to prominence as a preacher and a man of learning. In 1617, at the invitation of John King, bishop of London, he preached a sermon at Paul's Cross in London, perhaps the most public pulpit in England. He published <span class="italic">The Masse Displayed</span> (1619), a translation of <span class="italic">La messe en fran&ccedil;ois</span> (1610) by the French protestant Jean B&eacute;d&eacute; de la Gormandi&egrave;re. He preached sermons at several official university occasions, including the annual <span class="roman">Oxford Act</span> in 1620. By 1621 he was a royal chaplain, an appointment renewed with the accession of Charles I in 1625. A collection of his preaching, <span class="italic">Sixe Sermons</span>, appeared in 1622 (a further collection, also entitled <span class="italic">Six Sermons</span>, was published posthumously in 1629).<br>
<br>In October 1622 Chaloner resigned his fellowship at All Souls, and shortly afterwards married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1604), daughter of George Hovenden, canon of Canterbury, and niece of the warden of All Souls. They had a son, Thomas, who died in infancy. Chaloner preached in Canterbury Cathedral on more than one occasion, presumably at the invitation of his father-in-law. At Oxford, Chaloner was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the chancellor, William, third earl of Pembroke, and when the headship of St Alban Hall fell vacant Pembroke chose Chaloner to fill it; he was admitted as principal on 29 December 1624.<br>
<br>Chaloner's polemical work <span class="italic">Credo ecclesiam sanctam catholicam: the authoritie, universalitie and visibilitie of the church</span> (1625; 2nd edn, 1638) was a contribution to the current debate about whether the antecedents of the Church of England were to be found inside or outside the Church of Rome. Dismissing the idea of a simple polarity, Chaloner skilfully argues for a complex synthesis&#151;&#145;our Church had in those dayes a twofold subsistencie, the one separate from the Church of Rome, the other mixt and conjoyned with it&#146;  (Chaloner, <span class="italic">Credo</span>, 91)&#151;that is, separate in the persons of all the early reformers, and conjoined in the persons of all those who retained in their hearts the simple faith of the early church, and who were &#145;baptised into Christs Truth, and not the Popes errors&#146;  (ibid., 95). Published in the same volume with <span class="italic">Credo</span> was <span class="italic">Unde Zizania? The Originall and Progresse of Heresie</span>, a sermon that Chaloner had preached before James I at Theobalds in Hertfordshire in 1624.<br>
<br>In religion Chaloner was a Calvinist episcopalian very much in tune with the then prevailing orthodoxy of the Church of England establishment under Archbishop George Abbot. He charts a course between, on the one hand, the Arminians&#151;&#145;shall we feare &hellip; lest Altars and Images be taken away? &hellip; Neither our Prayers nor Sacrifices stand in need of such trimming&#146;  (Chaloner, <span class="italic">Sixe Sermons</span>, 321&#150;2)&#151;and, on the other, the puritans, who &#145;cannot brooke the Pope in the world, [but] would be glad, were they of the number, to have ten in a Parish&#146;  (ibid., 182&#150;3).<br>
<br>Chaloner deplored obfuscation of any kind, and valued exposition through clear and precise language, of which his sermons are models. His knowledge of the church fathers, the schoolmen, and more recent theologians was compendious, and his interests also ranged beyond theology: he was, for example, conversant with contemporary developments in science. His respect for learning was great, as was his scorn of ignorance: &#145;I could wish them more charitie then to grudge that other men see with two eyes, because they can see but with one&#146;  (Chaloner, <span class="italic">Sixe Sermons</span>, 347). He was signally ready to accept what he felt to be essential truths whatever their immediate source, whether from the ancient philosophers and poets &#145;who had not those lights that wee have, and yet saw farre more then many of us doe&#146;  (ibid., 338), or even from the Church of Rome: &#145;Christian libertie &hellip; ties us not to abrogate a good or indifferent thing for the abuse, but rather to preserve the substance, and to pare off the corruption&#146;  (Chaloner, <span class="italic">Masse</span>, preface).<br>
<br>Chaloner died at St Alban Hall on 25 July 1625, aged thirty-four, a victim of an outbreak of the plague. His body was hurriedly buried the same night in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin. A monument was later raised to his memory.<br>
