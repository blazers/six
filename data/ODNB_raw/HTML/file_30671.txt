<span class="headword">Beeching,  Henry Charles</span>  (1859&#150;1919), <span class="occ">dean of Norwich and author</span>, was born on 15 May 1859 at 16 Dorset Street, London. He was the second son of James Plumer George Beeching, and came from a Sussex family of shipowners and bankers who had long held land at Bexhill. His mother was Harriet, daughter of William Skaife, of Knaresborough, whose family had lived for many generations near Pateley Bridge, Yorkshire. In 1875 he went to the City of London School, where he came under the influence of Dr Edwin A. Abbott, who became his mentor. In October 1878 he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, as an open exhibitioner, and soon became one of a circle which included J. W. Mackail, J. St Loe Strachey, Clinton Dawkins, Rennell Rodd, and Sidney Lee. His enthusiasm for English literature, and more especially for English poetry, was stimulated by his Balliol friendships, and his own gift for writing verse was soon apparent. He contributed to an undergraduate periodical, <span class="italic">Waifs and Strays</span>, and in 1879 published, with J. W. Mackail and J. B. B. Nichols, a small volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Mensae secundae</span>; this was followed by <span class="italic">Love in Idleness</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">Love's Looking-Glass</span> (1891), both written with the same collaborators. He graduated BA in 1883.<br>
<br>In 1882 Beeching was ordained deacon, and became curate of St Matthew's, Mossley Hill, Liverpool, where he remained until 1885, when he moved to the living of Yattendon, Berkshire. In 1890 he married Mary, daughter of the Revd A. J. Plow and niece of Robert Bridges, the poet. They had three daughters. In his country parish, Beeching devoted himself to literary work, particularly the study of the English poets. In 1895 he published his best-known volume of verse, <span class="italic">Love in a Garden and other Poems</span>. In 1896 he began to contribute anonymously to the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, of which his friend St Loe Strachey was then editor. These contributions were published in book form, also anonymously, in 1898, as <span class="italic">Pages from a Private Diary</span>; the second edition (1903) bore the pseudonym Urbanus Sylvan. In 1900 his edition of Milton was published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1900 Beeching gave up his work as a country clergyman, and became chaplain of Lincoln's Inn and professor of pastoral theology at King's College, London. In 1902 he was appointed canon of Westminster, a most congenial post for a man of his tastes. He was select preacher at Oxford in 1896&#150;7 and again in 1912&#150;13; at Cambridge in 1903, 1909, and 1912; and at Dublin in 1905. In 1906 he published <span class="italic">Provincial Letters and other Papers</span>, and in 1909 a life of Francis Atterbury. During this London period he also produced several volumes of sermons and lectures, including <span class="italic">Religio laici</span> (1902), <span class="italic">The Bible Doctrine of Atonement</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">William Shakespeare &hellip; a Reply to Mr George Greenwood, MP</span> (1908). He also edited two volumes of sermons and lectures by his friend Alfred Ainger.<br>
<br>In 1911 Beeching was appointed dean of Norwich. He became keenly interested in the history and services of his cathedral, and took an active part in the life of the city. His health began to fail in 1918, and on 25 February 1919 he died at the deanery, Norwich, from heart failure. His ashes were buried in Norwich Cathedral on 3 March. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Beeching was eminent both as churchman and man of letters. A man of wide sympathies and varied interests, he was beloved and successful alike as country rector, canon of Westminster, and dean of Norwich. As a preacher he showed learning and eloquence. He was a liberal churchman, but no controversialist, and he had a deep love for the ritual and liturgy of the Church of England. He was an essayist and critic who was &#145;sound rather than brilliant&#146;  (A. Ralli, <span class="italic">History of Shakespeare Criticism</span>, 3, 1932, 269, 371&#150;3). His own poetry, though slender in volume, is marked by technical skill, polished wit, and the verbal dexterity which made his epigrams famous.<br>
