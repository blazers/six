<span class="headword">Fawkener, Sir  Everard</span>  (1694&#150;1758), <span class="occ">merchant and diplomatist</span>, was born on 23 February 1694 in the City of London and baptized on the same day at St Michael Bassishaw. The Fawkener family were long-established country gentry, with a seat at Uppingham Manor, Rutland. They had been engaged in trade, especially in the Levant, since the seventeenth century, and Everard's father, William (1642&#150;1716), who became one of the leading members of the Levant Company, was a prosperous merchant. He married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1700), the daughter of Ralphe Boxe, a citizen and druggist, in 1681; Everard was the eighth of their ten children. After an early classical education (Voltaire refers to his love of Horace, Virgil, and ancient Greek coins in a letter to Fran&ccedil;ois Augustin Paradis de Moncrif in February 1743;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 92.336&#150;7)), probably from private tutors, Fawkener entered the family business. In 1716 he was sent out to Aleppo, where he remained until 1725. This period coincided with the rise in importance of the firm Snelling and Fawkeners, who were the leading Levant traders by the 1730s, and it is likely that Fawkener would have become a man of wealth from his years in Aleppo. He met Voltaire in Paris in 1725, possibly on his return journey; it marked the beginnings of an enduringly memorable friendship. The following year he offered hospitality to the French writer when the latter found himself in England, alone, impoverished, and distressed. Fawkener had purchased or leased a country house at Wandsworth, then a village outside London, and this became Voltaire's home for large parts of his stay (1726&#150;8).<br>
<br>Thereafter Fawkener remained a merchant until 1735, when he was made ambassador to the Sublime Porte in Constantinople. For Voltaire, this elevation of a merchant to a senior diplomatic post convincingly demonstrated that England was the home of freedom&#151;unlike France, where such social mobility was unthinkable. As he put it to Fawkener in a letter dated 22 February 1736: &#145;Certainly England is the only country where commerce and virtue are to be rewarded with such an honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 87.363). However, Voltaire apparently did not grasp the exceptionality of such an appointment, the reasons for which are still not entirely clear. Norma Perry succinctly sums up various grounds of eligibility:<blockquote>he was in fact only forty-one years old in 1735, he was a gentleman, he was wealthy, he moved in the best circles, he was well-acquainted with the east, he was a member of the powerful Levant company, he was knowledgeable, he was esteemed and liked. (Perry, <span class="italic">Sir Everard Fawkener</span>, 44)</blockquote>Perry adds elsewhere one further consideration: he was ambitious  (ibid., 45&#150;6). In order to make his standing commensurate with his new situation, Fawkener was created knight bachelor on 3 October 1735. His term of office as ambassador lasted until November 1742, when he was granted permission to return home for a brief leave to attend to family business. But in the event he did not go back to Turkey. His stay had been largely unmemorable, but it appears that he fulfilled his duties with total assiduity and competence.<br>
<br>In March 1745 Fawkener was appointed secretary to the duke of Cumberland, a post he held for the rest of his days, and shortly afterwards joint paymaster-general. The duke commanded all British land forces and as such was soon engaged in the Flanders campaign against the French in the War of the Austrian Succession (resulting in the French victory at Fontenoy) and the following year in Scotland opposing the Young Pretender, Bonnie Prince Charlie, which led to the decisive Hanoverian victory at Culloden in April 1746. Throughout these activities Fawkener was &#145;in constant attendance upon the Duke&#146;  (Perry, <span class="italic">Sir Everard Fawkener</span>, 95). But he did not relish his duties in Scotland: &#145;It is not pleasant campaigning here, but our Master and the service reconcile us to it&#146;  (ibid., 100). In July he left the highlands behind and was presumably home in London for the victory celebrations in the autumn&#151;which included a performance of Handel's <span class="italic">Judas Maccabaeus</span>, composed in Cumberland's honour. There remained the trial of Lord Lovat for treason in supporting the Jacobite cause (he was hanged in April 1747), at which Fawkener reported on his interrogations of the rebel. His unpalatable (and seemingly unsuccessful) task had been to elicit evidence that might damn Lovat's accomplices. Cumberland's employ must often have meant moral compromise. Further disappointment ensued. Fawkener had been named envoy to Frederick of Prussia at Potsdam; but, for whatever reason, the nomination was rescinded. A letter to Voltaire, dated 13 August 1751, suggests that Fawkener blamed himself for failing to prosecute his own interests sufficiently  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 96.259&#150;60). Though he claims he &#145;was pleas'd not a little&#146; at being passed over, it sounds like sour grapes.<br>
<br>Fawkener remained a bachelor until he was fifty-two years of age, when, on 19 February 1747, he married Harriot (1725&#150;1777), the daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Churchill and his junior by thirty years; the couple had two sons and a daughter. His later years were generally something of an anticlimax. Fawkener's health was failing and his finances were falling into confusion (probably through extravagant living). When he died in Bath on 16 November 1758, he was both insolvent and intestate. He was buried three days later in Bath Abbey, where there is a memorial tablet to him.<br>
<br>It is the association with Voltaire that has given Fawkener a special significance among his peers. The only Englishman with whom the French <i>philosophe</i> ever developed close ties of affection, he was to the end for Voltaire a symbol of all that he thought best about England: his honourable mercantile background, the useful cosmopolitan life he had led as both trader and diplomatist abroad, his apparent lack of snobbery about aristocratic privilege. More than twenty letters written by Voltaire to Fawkener between 1735 and 1753 survive. It was to Fawkener, &#145;marchand anglais&#146;, that Voltaire dedicated his tragedy <span class="italic">Za&iuml;re</span> in 1733. This was a highly unorthodox action in the eyes of conventional Frenchmen, and was felt to be beneath the dignity of tragedy (a parody of <span class="italic">Za&iuml;re</span>, d'Allainville's <span class="italic">Temple du go&ucirc;t</span>, took its revenge by portraying a certain &#145;Kafener&#146; as a clownish merchant, slovenly dressed and smoking a pipe). For Voltaire the dedication bespoke his admiration at a &#145;profession which establishes the greatness of the State&#146;; and he composed a second such epistle in 1736, when he enjoyed dedicating it to &#145;le chevalier Falkener, ambassadeur d'Angleterre &agrave; la Porte Ottomane&#146;. Voltaire's last contact with the Fawkener family occurred just four years before his death, when Sir Everard's sons visited him at Ferney in 1774. He had them sit at table on either side of him, crying out: &#145;que je me trouve heureux de me voir plac&eacute; entre deux Fawkeners!&#146; (&#145;what joy to find myself seated between two Fawkeners!&#146;; <span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 87.485). Fawkener endured in Voltaire's mind as a living ideal of what English civilization had achieved.<br>
