<span class="headword">Honywood, Sir  Thomas</span>, appointed Lord Honywood under the protectorate  (1587&#150;1666), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and local politician</span>, was born on 15 January 1587 at Betchworth Castle, Surrey, the second son of Robert Honywood, esquire (1545&#150;1627), and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1631), daughter of Sir Thomas Browne, whose seat Betchworth was. His paternal grandmother was the long-lived and devout <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13666/', "Mary Honywood")</script>, who died aged ninety-three in 1620. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13667/', "Michael Honywood")</script>, royalist and dean of Lincoln, was a younger brother.<br>
<br>Honywood was possibly a student of the Inner Temple in 1605, when a man of his name is described as of South Mimms, Middlesex, gentleman. He inherited Marks Hall, Essex, in 1631 and was knighted on 22 November 1632. Honywood married Hester (1606/7&#150;1681), widow of John Manning of Hackney and daughter of John Lamotte of London, both merchants, on 10 May 1634. They had seven children of whom only three, Thomas, John, and Elizabeth, survived their father.<br>
<br>Honywood was not active as magistrate or deputy lieutenant in the 1630s, perhaps out of antipathy to Charles I's political and religious policies. War with the Scots saw him named as an Essex commissioner for the collection of subsidies; fear of Irish insurgents saw him appointed commissioner for the &pound;400,000 tax of 1642.<br>
<br>Honywood was a committed puritan. He appointed a puritan to Markshall rectory in 1646 and befriended the puritan minister Ralph Josselin of Earls Colne. Driven by his religious proclivities he became a stalwart supporter of the parliamentarian cause. Named on every major ordinance relating to taxation, sequestration, and the militia he was a committed county committee man and a key divisional commissioner around Colchester. He was appointed a member of the Essex committee for scandalous ministers in both 1644 and 1654 and was nominated as an elder on the stillborn presbyterian classis of 1645&#150;8. In 1650 he was appointed commissioner for the Commonwealth church survey. He upheld the authority of parliament and its successor regimes as magistrate at quarter sessions, <i>c</i>.1645&#150;59 and was <i>custos rotulorum</i> between 1656 and 1659. He was keen to see local fortifications maintained.<br>
<br>Yet while acknowledging local concerns and expressing concerns to parliament about excessive demands (in 1643 describing his local administrative division as being &#145;infinitely oppressed&#146;), Honywood saw beyond any narrow county provincialism  (BL, Egerton MS 2647, fol. 199). In June 1643 he backed the attempt by the earl of Essex at a levee <i>en masse</i> &#145;for the defence of Religion and libertie&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 189, fol. 10). He saw &#145;forwardness&#146; in Essex as potentially inspirational to the well affected in other counties  (BL, Egerton MS 2647, fol. 146). In spring 1643, as colonel of a regiment of foot, he took Essex trained bands to Reading and in July 1644 took them out again to the siege of Greenland House. The committee of both kingdoms consequently acknowledged his &#145;very good service to the public&#146; in preventing the enemy from entering the very &#145;bowels of the Association&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644</i>, 346). Significantly he had been one of the Essex signatories at the inception of the eastern association in February 1643 and was active in supporting both it and the subsequent New Model Army.<br>
<br>Honywood was decisive in undermining local support for the royalists during the second civil war in 1648 through his rapid deployment of the trained bands. He preserved the magazine at Coggeshall. He joined Thomas, Lord Fairfax, on 11 June and subsequently formed part of the forces besieging Colchester. He appears to have headed the signatories to the articles of surrender at the end of August. Honywood's hostility towards the defeated was implacable; he opposed indemnity and demanded that enemy estates should be sequestrated and the money arising used to secure Essex from &#145;like imbroilments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.480, 473&#150;4). He insisted on the right of the Essex county committee and not Goldsmith's Hall to compound with them so that those suffering losses at Colchester could be compensated. Honywood was appointed to the high court of justice for trying Charles I in 1649, but did not attend.<br>
<br>Trouble flared again in Colchester and neighbouring counties at the end of 1650. Since Honywood had disobeyed orders by not dismantling the fortifications at Colchester the council of state was obliged to appoint him governor of its garrison with the power to raise militia forces and disarm suspects. In 1651 Honywood again came to the defence of the Commonwealth when Charles II threatened at Worcester. At the battle Honywood was in charge of a regiment of foot from Essex; his forces allowed Lieutenant-General Fleetwood &#145;to advance close up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 28 Aug&#150;4 Sept 1651, 1042). For this he was created a doctor of civil law by Oxford University. Locally, during 1655, Honywood, appointed a militia commissioner, zealously supported Cromwell's major-general, Hezekiah Heynes, by finding malignants; he and his fellow commissioners used godly rhetoric to request tough action against rebels and was &#145;most forward&#146; in his support of the decimation tax  (Thurloe, 4.320). That year Honywood stayed in Colchester to influence the elections there to ensure &#145;a good magistracy&#146;  (ibid., 320).<br>
<br>Honywood was elected MP for Essex in 1654 and 1656. He was appointed to several committees, from the committee for printing to a committee which considered abuses in alehouses; occasionally he acted as a teller. In December 1657 Honywood was made a peer and appointed to the upper house.<br>
<br>At the Restoration political settlement was all, and although excluded from the earl of Oxford's commission for deputy lieutenants for Essex and from the county bench Honywood received his pardon and paid his &#145;free and voluntary present&#146; in 1661, while drifting into a healthy political obscurity. He died aged seventy-nine at Cotton House in Westminster, the house of his son-in-law, on 26 May 1666 &#145;taken with a vomiting &amp;c&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. Essex 23, fol. 300). He was interred on 1 June in the chancel of Markshall church by Ralph Josselin.<br>
