<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hanson,  Joseph</span>  (1774&#150;1811), <span class="occ">radical and &#145;the weavers' friend&#146;</span>, was born on 17 October 1774, the son of William Hanson (1728/9&#150;1798), a merchant&#150;manufacturer of checks and cotton goods of Cannon Street, Manchester, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wagstaff (1749/50&#150;1822). He was baptized on 30 October 1774 at Cross Street Unitarian Chapel, Manchester. He joined the family business but after his father's death an inheritance enabled him to retire from trade and in 1808 he moved to Strangeways Hall, a mile north of Manchester.<br>
<br>Manchester became a centre of political radicalism during the French Revolutionary wars. Middle-class radicals were involved with Cross Street Chapel and with the Literary and Philosophical Society, to which Hanson was admitted as a member in 1795. In December 1795 he and his father signed a petition to parliament calling for peace with revolutionary France and protesting against legislation introduced by William Pitt's government to prohibit &#145;seditious&#146; meetings and publications. The Hanson family were friends with the radical printer William Cowdroy, and donated money to support his newspaper, the <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>. Following the Irish uprising of 1798 a magistrate's informant alleged that Hanson, &#145;a young man in partnership with his Father, a Merchant and who is supposed to be worth &pound;100,000&#146;, were providing financial support for the republican United English cells and the United Irish delegate James O'Coigley  (TNA: PRO, PC 1/42/140). The Hansons may also have been visited by the London radical John Thelwall when he stayed with William Cowdroy in 1801  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/62/238). Manchester was governed by high church, high Tory gentlemen and manufacturers, but they did not act on the information against Joseph Hanson and his father, unlike their well-publicized arrests for treason of Hanson's friends, the merchant and printer Thomas Walker in 1794 or William Cowdroy's son in 1798. Joseph Hanson never openly advocated parliamentary reform, so there was no evidence to support any possible charge against him.<br>
<br>The resumption of war with Napoleonic France in May 1803 caused the British government to announce a <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i> to defend the country against invasion. In the 1790s volunteer military regiments had been the preserve of the loyalist associations and anti-radical local &eacute;lites. The huge demand for manpower and the consequent patriotic fervour against Napoleon Bonaparte in 1803, however, offered an opportunity for gentlemen like Hanson and his friend and fellow Unitarian, Francis Dukinfield Astley of Dukinfield Hall, to raise volunteer regiments. In August 1803 Hanson formed the Manchester and Salford volunteer rifle corps, commanding six companies of riflemen, later joined by seven more companies from Bury and Stockport. On the eve of a military review on 4 June 1804, Hanson claimed the position of lieutenant-colonel, thereby assuming command over all the volunteer regiments. This was disputed by John Leigh Philips and James Ackers, commanding officers of the Royal and First Manchester and Salford volunteers respectively, and leading members of loyalist associations. Lord Hawkesbury, secretary of state, upheld Hanson's position, but the conflict escalated. Leigh Philips and fifty-three officers of the first regiment resigned in protest. Hanson challenged Leigh Philips to a duel on Kersal Moor on 28 July 1804. Magistrates prevented the duel and bound both men over to keep the peace. In December 1805 Hanson published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Brief Remarks on the Present Volunteer Establishment</span>, in which he called for reform of inefficient volunteer corps. Critics published several retorts that portrayed his remarks as unpatriotic. Hanson eventually resigned his command in December 1807.<br>
<br>Hanson developed his political ambitions at the general election of May 1807. He attempted to secure parliamentary candidacies at Chester and Stafford before the &#145;Friends of Independence&#146; at Preston put him forward to challenge the sitting whig&#150;tory coalition, which had been orchestrated there by Mancunian merchant&#150;manufacturers as a proxy for their own town, which lacked directed representation in the House of Commons. Preston was also a significant borough because of its extended franchise, which included a high proportion of weavers and cotton spinners employed by the two sitting MPs, Lord Stanley and Samuel Horrocks. Hanson attended weavers' meetings and announced his support for their petition to parliament for a minimum wage bill. As a receiver of goods to his father's business, he had first contact with the handloom weavers of the Manchester region and was aware of the impact of economic depression caused by the wartime closure of continental and American markets. Though Stanley and Horrocks retained their seats, Hanson gained 1001 votes, including nearly two-thirds of those cast by weavers.<br>
<br>Hanson quickly gained the moniker of &#145;the weavers' friend&#146;. In November 1807 delegates from south Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire held a meeting that resolved to ask Hanson to organize a regional petition for peace. He agreed, and the petition was signed by 40,000 people from the region. John Leigh Philips and the other Manchester local authorities again opposed his actions. In retort, Hanson published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Defence of the Petitions for Peace</span>, which by February 1808 was in its third edition. It is notable as an early example of the &#145;Manchester School&#146; of political-economic thought about the impact of war upon commerce.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1808, after the House of Commons rejected George Rose's motion to bring in a minimum wage bill for handloom weavers, Hanson attended the second of two large protest meetings on St George's Fields in Manchester. Denied permission from Lieutenant Trafford of the 4th dragoon guards to speak to the crowd, Hanson refused to leave the field and addressed the weavers' delegates, urging order but supporting their cause. He was arrested and charged for inciting disturbance of the peace. Nearly a year later, tried and found guilty at Lancaster spring assizes in April 1809, he was sentenced in May 1809 at the court of king's bench, London, to six months' imprisonment in the king's bench prison, Marshalsea, and a fine of &pound;100. Although he declined the offer of the weavers' committee to pay his fine, 39,600 inhabitants of Manchester, Bolton, Ashton, and Stockport subscribed a maximum of a penny each to a gold cup and silver salver, which the weavers' delegates presented to him in prison. Released on 15 November 1809, he was met five miles south of Macclesfield by a large crowd who drew his carriage through the town, which was repeated at Stockport and Manchester. A commemorative medal celebrating him as the weavers' friend was struck in 1810.<br>
<br>Chastened by his experience, Hanson retreated to his estate to live a private life. He nevertheless maintained his reputation among the handloom weavers, and when in 1811 the weavers' committee of Manchester with Bolton produced another petition of over 40,000 signatures they asked him to represent them at the ensuing House of Commons select committee to investigate their distress. Hanson went to London and gave evidence in June 1811 to testify to the weavers' grievances, but the select committee proved perfunctory and rejected proposals for limitations on apprentices and machinery.<br>
<br>Hanson was isolated from other middle-class radicals throughout his political career. His predicament reflected in part the &#145;church-and-king&#146; loyalist dominance of the Manchester &eacute;lites, and also his own temperament. He seems to have made little attempt to co-ordinate his activities with his Unitarian and radical colleagues such as Francis Dukinfield Astley, Joseph Kershaw, and William Cowdroy, though they did send affidavits in his support during his trial. His family attended Stand Unitarian Chapel in Pilkington near Bury rather than the more influential Cross Street Chapel in Manchester. Many Cross Street members, moreover, felt it necessary to dissociate themselves from supporting working-class movements. The merchant Samuel Hibbert-Ware dissolved his friendship with Hanson in 1808 because of his involvement in the peace petition campaign  (<span class="italic">A Reply to the Real Writer of a Pamphlet</span>, by A Townsman, Manchester, April 1808).<br>
<br>Joseph Hanson died, unmarried, on 7 September 1811, at Strangeways Hall, from dropsy and a liver disorder. He was buried in the family vault at Stand Chapel. His memorial tablet was inscribed with the purpose to &#145;remind those who live in happier times of one who in darker days loved his fellow men&#146;. Popular memory of his actions in the industrial regions of the north was however quickly overtaken by the tumultuous events of the post-war period.<br>
