<span class="headword">Lowman,  Moses</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1679, <em>d.</em> 1752), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and writer</span>, was baptized on 25 January 1679 at St Gabriel Fenchurch, London, the son of Moses and Anne Lowman. His father, who was educated at Merton and Magdalen colleges, Oxford, and proceeded MA on 21 June 1660, was ordained in the Church of England but left it for &#145;employment in the public revenues&#146;  (<span class="italic">Protestant Dissenter's Magazine</span>, Dec 1794, 465). Nothing is known of Moses's early schooling, but it is unlikely to have taken place among the dissenters. Destined for a career in the law, he entered the Middle Temple in March 1698, but left a year later to study divinity at the universities of Leiden and Utrecht. It is also unclear how he became a dissenter or trained for the ministry, but in 1710 he became assistant minister at the Presbyterian chapel in Grafton Square, Clapham. From 1714 until his death he was chief minister to the congregation.<br>
<br>Lowman's reputation rests on his scholarship, in particular his published works on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the various defences he made of protestant dissent, and theological controversy with members of the established church. His two works on Jewish history and worship &#145;contain many things in them not only curious but entirely new &hellip; He determined to follow and embrace the truth wherever he should find it&#146;  (Chandler, 41&#150;2). His commentaries and paraphrases on books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> were widely read and appreciated by both churchmen and dissenters. His <span class="italic">Paraphrase and Notes on the Revelation of St John</span> (1737), praised by Philip Doddridge, went to four editions, the last being as late as 1807. He was an active and public-spirited pastor, serving not only his own congregation but assisting other chapels in a poor financial position. However, more than one source states that he was a poor preacher.<blockquote>His discourses were obscure, the respect and esteem of his congregation must be due not on evidence for the acceptableness of his sermons [but] to the excellence and weight of his character, and of the candour of his hearers, who, possessed of high sentiments of the latter passed over the unpleasing defects of the former. (<span class="italic">Protestant Dissenter's Magazine</span>, 1794, 465&#150;7)</blockquote>Lowman sat lightly in the denominational setting. He was recognized at various times as a Presbyterian and an Independent. Voting with the Presbyterian majority for non-subscription at Salters' Hall in 1719, he was also a founder member of the London Congregational board in 1727. His style appeared to match the religious sentiments of the time. &#145;His piety was rational, not superstitious; the effect of principle not enthusiasm; grave but not morose; and serious without being disfigured by sourness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Protestant Dissenter's Magazine</span>, 1794, 469).<br>
<br>Lowman was married to Martha (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter of John Travers, a wealthy London merchant; they had two sons and a daughter. He died at Clapham on 3 May 1752; according to Samuel Chandler, who preached his funeral sermon, &#145;he continued in his ministerial labours till accident and disorder put an end to his services&#146;  (Chandler, 39&#150;40).<br>
