<span class="headword">Ayliffe,  John</span>  (1676&#150;1732), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, was born at Pember, Hampshire, the son of John Ayliffe. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he matriculated in February 1696; he became BA (1699), MA (1703), LLB, and LLD (1710). He was a fellow of New College and, between 1704 and 1710, he practised as a proctor in the chancellor's court. In 1706&#150;8 he fought off disciplinary actions, having been accused of professional misconduct. When the case came before the chancellor's court Ayliffe crossed swords with the chancellor's deputy and judge, Dr Thomas Wood. Asked to retract his words, Ayliffe refused and Wood gave an interlocutory sentence depriving him of his office as proctor (3 May 1706). The case came before the delegates of the university's congregation, who were divided, and went henceforth to the convocation house, where a majority of the delegates pronounced judgment in favour of Ayliffe. However, the proctor acting for the chancellor's office challenged that decision before the high court of delegates, who ordered that Ayliffe be reinstated as proctor. Ayliffe himself read out the delegates' judgment in the chancellor's court on 23 January 1708. During the following years and until 1710 he continued to appear regularly as proctor in the university's court. That year a letter to Dr John Irish, acting judge in the chancellor's court, cost him a reprimand for impertinence; also that year, he was being sued for debt in the same court. Whether any of these cases was related to Ayliffe's whig political opinions, or, as he himself put it, his &#145;adhering to the principles of the Revolution&#146;  (J. Ayliffe, <span class="italic">The Antient and Present State of the University of Oxford</span>, preface), is unknown. There is, however, little doubt that the proceedings, which, a few years later, cost him both his status in the university and his fellowship, were primarily politically motivated by those of a tory disposition.<br>
<br>In 1714 Ayliffe published a work on the University of Oxford and its colleges (<span class="italic">The Antient and Present State of the University of Oxford</span>, 2 vols.; reissued in 1723). The list of subscribers mentions some 300 names, 30 of whom were members of Ayliffe's own college. The book reflected a dual approach. Part of the work was historical and, as Ayliffe acknowledged, borrowed to a large extent from Anthony Wood's earlier work. The book was very much that of a lawyer: the chapters on the corporate status of the colleges and on the procedural law applied in the chancellor's court and other university bodies were some of the most comprehensive studies on the subject written by an English civil lawyer. On several aspects Ayliffe's expressed views were strongly polemical. As a recurrent theme, Ayliffe denounced the propensity of some heads of colleges and university officials, particularly in his own time, to act beyond their proper powers; that tendency would, in Ayliffe's account, correspond to the political inclination of those (in his own words) &#145;promoting Arbitrary Power in the Prince&#146;. The argument no doubt had political merits, but may well also have been inspired by Ayliffe's personal grievances while researching his book, in particular when he tried to list the colleges' benefactions and their original purposes; on several occasions, he claimed, he had been denied access to the college archives. In some instances Ayliffe's attacks were more personal. In the last pages of his account he appears to refer to his own successful defence against the decision depriving him of his proctor's office and refers sharply to Thomas Wood. Nevertheless, Ayliffe's demotion from Oxford was provoked by more veiled attacks in his book.<br>
<br>In November 1714 Ayliffe was sued in the university court by both Dr Bernard Gardiner, at the time vice-chancellor, and Dr Thomas Braithwaite. Both actions were for injury and damage, and in Gardiner's case, the warrant for the defendant's arrest stated the value of the damage at &pound;100. Both plaintiffs may have felt that they were the target of Ayliffe's accusations regarding the maladministration of Clarendon's benefaction. In addition Braithwaite may well have regarded Ayliffe's remarks on the &#145;supine negligence of a late warden&#146; of New College  as referring to himself, whereas the accusation that the keeper of the university archives had been denying access to the records to members of the university who had a legitimate interest clearly referred to Gardiner. This time Ayliffe's legal and procedural skills were no match for the determination of his adversaries. His own demeanour (including an escape from the bedel who had come to New College to serve him with the warrant of his arrest) did not help his cause. The chancellor's court pronounced a decree expelling Ayliffe from the university (7 September 1714/15). The following day the sentence was confirmed by the convocation house, which also pronounced Ayliffe's degradation.<br>
<br>About the same time Ayliffe's adversaries at New College moved to have him deprived of his fellowship. For several years the fellowship of New College had been divided on political lines. Braithwaite's election as warden in 1703 had been strongly contested by the college's whig minority; in 1712 another tory, Dr John Cobb, was elected as his successor. The charges brought against Ayliffe included his unauthorized absence from Oxford in December 1714 (while he was in London, seeking remedies against the proceedings in the university), persistent disobedience towards the college authorities, and an incident which ensured that the case became notorious, his threat, expressed during a conversation with another member of the college, that he might pistol the warden. Nevertheless, the proceedings failed to secure a majority in favour of his expulsion. The case was brought before the college visitor, the bishop of Winchester, who issued an order requiring Ayliffe to acknowledge that the charges were justified and to submit an apology to those directly concerned (26 July 1715). Ayliffe refused to submit and resigned. His detractors would claim that he had sold his fellowship.<br>
<br>Both the proceedings in the chancellor's court and in New College were discussed at length in a pamphlet published the following year, <span class="italic">The Case of Dr. Ayliffe, at Oxford</span> (1716). The pamphlet, probably written by Ayliffe himself, or at least directly inspired by him, emphasized the political background of the case and argued that the proceedings were marred by irregularities. Its publication provoked Gardiner and Braithwaite, or their supporters, to counter Ayliffe's accusations regarding the alleged malversations at the Clarendon printing house with <span class="italic">An Answer</span> (<i>c</i>.1716). Ayliffe failed to secure sufficient support either at Oxford or among whig journalists, and eventually abandoned his attempts to challenge the Oxford proceedings either through a writ of prohibition or an appeal to the high court of delegates.<br>
<br>Ayliffe was appointed a commissioner for licensing hawkers and pedlars, but did not give up his academic interests and ambitions. In 1726 he published a treatise on canon law (<span class="italic">Parergon juris canonici Anglicani, or, A commentary by way of supplement to the canons and constitutions of the Church of England</span>, 1726; 2nd edn, 1734). The <span class="italic">Parergon</span> was a traditional commonplace book on canon law and ecclesiastical discipline, alphabetically arranged by keywords. The introduction, based on a wide range of scholarship, outlined the history of the canon law and provided arguments for the general thesis that, subject to restrictions imposed by the common law, by customary and statute law, and by the prerogatives of the king, canon law was part of the law of the realm. Otherwise, the book was aimed at a practical level and tended to avoid arguments which might have involved the author in domestic political controversies. Ayliffe regularly referred to English authorities, both canonistic and lay (such as statutes and law reports); he occasionally drew comparisons with continental legal systems, especially the Netherlands, France, and the empire. He relied in the main, however, on highly traditional canon law and civil law authors, in particular late medieval canonists.<br>
<br>In 1732 a small publication on the Roman law of pledges was meant to attract sufficient public interest for a larger treatise on Roman law. The project failed to come to fruition in Ayliffe's time and it was only in 1734 that the first volume of his <span class="italic">New Pandect of Roman Civil Law</span> was published. The book followed to some extent the structure of the institutional system, but the subdivision in persons, things, and obligations was preceded by a historical introduction and a chapter on &#145;the law in general&#146;. The book offered a systematic treatment of, mostly, private law, providing numerous references to parallels or differences in English law and in continental legal systems. For Ayliffe the Roman law's importance and authority were mainly founded in its rationality, which also explained why it had exercised a major influence in the law of nations. In a striking passage of the introduction Ayliffe played down the differences between common law and civil law:<blockquote>If there is that wide Difference between the <i>Common</i> and <i>Civil</i> Laws, in their Forms of Pleading, and Manner of Trial, this is only the Stile, Practice, and Course of the Courts: But there is a Mixture in the <i>Principles</i>, <i>Maxims</i>, and <i>Reasons</i> on these two Laws; and indeed, the Laws of all Countries are mixed with the <i>Civil</i> Law, which has arrived to any Degree of Perfection. 'Tis true, that the <i>Common</i> and <i>Civil</i> Laws had not the same Root and Stock; yet, by Inoculating and Grafting, the Body and Branches seem at this Day to be almost of a Piece. (J. Ayliffe, <span class="italic">A New Pandect of Roman Civil Law</span>, 1734, introduction, xlvii)</blockquote>Throughout the work a large selection of major civilian authorities were quoted. However, as in the <span class="italic">Parergon</span>, the civil law authorities Ayliffe referred to were to a large extent typical late medieval and sixteenth-century authors, whom, by early eighteenth-century standards, it was no longer fashionable to quote directly. Thus, in spite of its intrinsic qualities as a modern treatise on Roman law, the book expressed an indebtedness to a scholarship which, already before Ayliffe's time, had largely become obsolete.<br>
<br>Ayliffe died at his residence in Crane Court, Fleet Street, London, on 5 November 1732, and was buried in St Dunstan's Church, Fleet Street. Ayliffe's influence on legal scholarship was limited. The English translation of Thomas Oughton's work on ecclesiastical procedure (1831) included, among various additions, extracts from the <span class="italic">Parergon</span>. The assessment of Ayliffe's work has varied. To some, it is &#145;dull, tedious and confused&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), whereas others have referred to Ayliffe as &#145;the most learned [English] Romanist before Buckland&#146;  (Simpson, 25). A reappraisal has viewed Ayliffe as &#145;a symbol of &hellip; the renaissance of classical Roman law studies in British universities &hellip; a pioneer of serious modern Roman law studies in England&#146;  (Coquillette, 213). None of these assessments appears to be based on anything more than a cursory reading of Ayliffe's work, or a superficial acquaintance with civil law scholarship in his time.<br>
