<span class="headword">Bernard, Sir  Charles Edward</span>  (1837&#150;1901), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at 16 The Crescent, Clifton, Bristol, on 21 December 1837, the son of James Frogo Bernard MD and his wife, Marianne Amelia Lawrence, sister of John, first Lord Lawrence. He was educated at Rugby School and in 1855 accepted a cadetship at Addiscombe College; in 1856 he switched to the East India College at Haileybury, and passed out in 1857 at the head of the list for Bengal with prizes in mathematics, Persian, Hindustani, and Hindi. He married at Calcutta on 23 October 1862 Susan Capel, daughter of Richard Tawney, rector of Willoughby, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Bernard's early service was in the Punjab and afterwards the Central Provinces, where he was secretary to two chief commissioners, Sir Richard Temple and Sir George Campbell (in 1893 he was to oversee the posthumous publication of the latter's memoirs). In 1871 he became the commissioner of Nagpur division, and for four years he was a member of the council of the lieutenant-governor of Bengal. In 1880 he was appointed judicial commissioner of the Central Provinces.<br>
<br>In 1881 Bernard became home secretary to the government of India and in 1882 chief commissioner of British Burma. Upper Burma was then still independent, but in November 1885 Lord Dufferin, largely at the urging of Bernard, sent in an army and deposed King Thibaw. Bernard applied his characteristic energy to governing the new territory, but was handicapped by his disregard for Burmese social and political institutions. As a liberal he put great faith in the civilizing nature of British ideals of law and order and attempted to superimpose on Upper Burma the wholly alien system of civil administration developed in British India. Resistance to British occupation was not easily crushed, and as guerrilla outbreaks continued throughout 1886 rumours spread in Calcutta that Bernard was not up to the job, a view fuelled by a series of critical reports in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. This however was not the official line and in 1886 Bernard was created KCSI.<br>
<br>In 1887 he was briefly the resident at Mysore and chief commissioner of Coorg, before returning to England in 1888 to become secretary to the department of revenue, statistics, and commerce at the India Office. In 1889 he compiled a comprehensive report on Britain's administration of India since the uprising of 1857, which was laid before parliament. He finally retired in 1901 after forty-three years' continuous service. His extraordinary breadth of experience (he had served in all of the Indian provinces except the North-Western Provinces) meant that for the last twenty of these years his advice was sought on numerous issues. He was more a man of common sense than of original or radical ideas and although a liberal, his opposition to illiberal acts, such as the <span class="roman">Vernacular Press Act</span>, was typically based on a pragmatic appreciation of their inutility rather than moral repugnance. He was popular with his colleagues and made remarkably few enemies during his career. The Bernard Free Library in Rangoon was built in his memory.<br>
<br>He died on a visit to Chamonix in France on 19 September 1901 and was buried there the next day. His wife survived him; of their eight children the eldest son, James Henry, followed his father into the Indian Civil Service and died of cholera together with his wife at Chinsura in Bengal in November 1907.<br>
