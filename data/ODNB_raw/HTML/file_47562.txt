<span class="headword">Instone, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1878&#150;1937), <span class="occ">shipping and aviation entrepreneur</span>, was born at Gravesend on 16 August 1878, the son of Adolphe Instone, and the eldest of three brothers. He was educated at Tunbridge Wells and at Boulogne. At the age of fifteen he went to work in the port, and soon acquired a very considerable knowledge of shipping between the United Kingdom and the continent. He married in 1910 Alice Maud Lieberman; they had five daughters. At a time unknown before the First World War he set up S. Instone &amp; Co. Ltd of Cardiff to trade between Cardiff and Antwerp, and London and Antwerp, with coal as the principal cargo. Looking ahead at how he might expand his business, he bought the Bow Creek site of the Thames iron works, where he established the Instone wharf to allow direct trans-shipment to the Great Eastern Railway, later the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), so as to avoid the congested lines through London itself. He worked closely with his brothers Theodore and Alfred, the latter of whom described their work in <span class="italic">Early Birds</span> (1924). This book concentrated on the airline which the brothers founded in 1921 to speed their bills of lading from Cardiff and London to Antwerp and so avoid demurrage charges. The Instone Air Line, which ran from London to Paris from 1919, was a pioneering enterprise. It merged with Imperial Airways in 1924, with Samuel Instone remaining on the board until his death in 1937.<br>
<br>In 1921 S. Instone &amp; Co. Ltd went public with a nominal capital of &pound;500,000 (of which &pound;300,000 was issued). Instone himself was chairman of the Askern Coal and Iron Company Ltd, and of the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company (1921). The combination of his modern ideas, introduction of machinery, and other cost-saving ideas, and the militancy of the declining mining industry with its rival unions, the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF) and the South Wales Miners' Industrial Union, resulted in a conflict that lasted a decade. In the shrill rhetoric of those depression years from the failed general strike of 1926 to the gradual recovery and amalgamation of the mines in the late 1930s, Instone was a leader in the fight for modern management and cost controls. This led him into a number of fights, and to his being labelled one of the &#145;bloodsucking rich&#146;. The result is that his reputation now depends upon whether the literature is from the miners' or the owners' side, though recent scholarship has taken a more balanced view.<br>
<br>The battle with the SWMF lasted until 1936, and ran that colliery into a &pound;1 million debt, when a compromise left the Instones in charge in return for recognition of the SWMF. The adventure into Benzol (an industrial solvent derived from coal tar) ended in constant bickering over coal quality, and the plant's cleansing powers. In truth the venture was ill timed. At the Askern in Yorkshire he was known for the establishment of a model housing estate at Instoneville, and for his successful prosecution of an action for slander against Herbert Smith, then president of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. A hard worker himself, he had much sympathy for the miners in spite of the demands of modernization. He and Theodore were strong characters, but respected each other's judgements, and worked with Alfred in complete harmony and respect, as <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted  (11 Nov 1937). Knighted in 1921, Sir Samuel was much liked for his many human qualities. He was a member of the lieutenancy of the City of London, and a liveryman of the Loriners' Company. Very interested in congestion in the streets, he started one of the waterbus services on the Thames. He lived at 11 Hanover Terrace, London, and died in the London Clinic on 9 November 1937 after an operation from which it was expected he would recover.<br>
<br>Sir Samuel was buried on 10 November in the Jewish cemetery, Beaconsfield Road, Willesden, London, and the memorial service was held at the West London Synagogue, Upper Berkeley Street. His wife outlived him. At death he left &pound;1034 gross, presumably having previously made farsighted legal arrangements.<br>
