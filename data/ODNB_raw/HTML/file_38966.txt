<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cowie,  James</span>  (1886&#150;1956), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 16 May 1886 at Netherton of Dalgety, a small upland farm near the village of Cuminestown in Aberdeenshire, the second of three sons of Peter Smart Cowie (1858&#150;1919) and his wife, Katherine Tennant (1859&#150;1926). With many generations of nonconformist farming folk in his ancestry, James was expected to carry on the family tradition, but he had other ideas. A clever, indeed an intellectual, youth, he finished his years at the local village school as a pupil teacher before commencing (but for some reason never completing) a degree course in English at Aberdeen University. Instead he enrolled in 1906 at the United Free Church Training College in Aberdeen, where his talent as a visual artist was encouraged by the art teacher, James Hector. In 1909 Cowie accepted the post of art master at Fraserburgh Academy, but in 1912, having decided to become a painter, he enrolled at the Glasgow School of Art which was then, under its young English director, Francis Newbery, acknowledged as one of the leading art schools in Britain. Newbery recognized Cowie's ability and agreed to allow him to complete the diploma course in two years instead of the usual three. Because he gained his diploma in 1914 just as war with Germany was declared, Cowie's strict conscientious scruples led to four years of uncreative labour with a pioneer corps. Afterwards, from 1918 to 1935, he worked as art master in a small Lanarkshire mining town not far from Glasgow. It was there, at Bellshill Academy, that he began to develop his primary gift of expression through drawing, using the art room as though it were his own studio, working along with his pupils, drawing the children, singly and in groups as they themselves worked, studying and recording details of their physiognomy, clothes, and attitudes, and thus generating ideas which might be developed later in his Glasgow studio. In 1918 Cowie married Nancy Buchanan, who had been a fellow student; her death in 1923 left him with a baby daughter, Ruth. Three years later he married Alice Graham, a teacher; the couple had a daughter, Barbara.<br>
<br>All his life Cowie looked to the early Renaissance for stimulation. He tended to despise work painted <i>au premier coup</i> and his own major paintings were invariably created after many careful drawings and preliminary studies. In this he was out of step with most of the Scottish painting of his day. Yet he did not despise the activity, or the importance, of the Royal Scottish Academy of which he became an associate member in 1936, full academician in 1943, and honorary secretary in 1948.<br>
<br>Cowie was appointed head of drawing and painting at Gray's School of Art, Aberdeen, in 1935 but he found the restrictions of art school routine distasteful and after only one session resigned in order to accept the more congenial post of warden at the Hospitalfield College of Art in Arbroath, Angus. He remained at Arbroath from 1937 until 1948; this was his most productive period both as a painter and as a teacher. Hospitalfield was then a residential summer school for a limited number of post-diploma students from the four Scottish art schools, and it was there, in the large mock-baronial mansion built in the early nineteenth century over a medieval original and set in rich farmlands near the wide River Tay, that Cowie's work as an artist came to full fruition. In his paintings of the schoolchildren at Bellshill he had succeeded in developing a kind of realism which, to the perceptive viewer, was beginning to be rich in suggestion of what seemed to the artist the pitiful brevity of youth. Even at that early stage in his career his drawings and paintings had been full of references to the inexorable passing of time and to the ephemerality of existence: his sketchbooks and notebooks contain several fragmentary jottings and half-finished poems on this theme. Later, at Hospitalfield, he began to explore and develop a kind of metaphysical still life in which elements with a personal appeal for him&#151;tanagra figurines and classical statuettes, prints from the old masters, sea shells, a leaf, an apple&#151;would be married with fragments of mirror-reflected landscape to offer a sometimes puzzling wealth of associative meaning. Cowie was not so much a realist as a surrealist, but in a delicate, subtle manner which had little in common with Dal&iacute; or even Magritte. His landscapes, too, were almost invariably charged with mystery: in <span class="italic">Evening Star</span> (1944, Aberdeen Art Gallery), for example, an ambitious, life-size painting, he placed three female nudes in the mouth of a cave in sandstone rocks, a natural setting conveying a sense of menace. Yet for all the evidence of preconception and extreme care in composition in his finished works, his notebooks occasionally contain direct sketches in watercolour, including attempts to capture fleeting effects of light.<br>
<br>Cowie was in no sense a professional portrait painter, but to the few he did paint, such as the official portrait of his friend Sir Frank Mears, president of the Royal Scottish Academy (1944, Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh), and the earlier full-length studies of his daughters Ruth Cowie (1933, priv. coll.) and Barbara Graham Cowie (1938, Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh), he brought unusual insight. When he retired in 1948 he moved permanently to Edinburgh, where in 1952 he was awarded the honorary degree of LLD at the university. Later that year he was disabled by a severe stroke. James Cowie died at his home, 11 Rothesay Place, Edinburgh, on 18 April 1956 and was buried on 20 April in the churchyard of Kirkton of Auchterless, Monquitter, Aberdeenshire, under a headstone which he himself had designed for his parents and elder brother. He was survived by his second wife. His profound knowledge and understanding of the Italian quattrocento (a period beloved by him), his wide reading, and, above all, his sensitive draughtsmanship (perhaps the finest in Scotland in his day) combined to make his work exceptional. Collections of Cowie's work are in the Aberdeen Art Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.<br>
