<span class="headword">Blagrove,  Henry Gamble</span>  (1811&#150;1872), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born at Nottingham on 20 October 1811, the eldest son of the composer and violinist Richard Blagrove, author of <span class="italic">A New and Improved System to the Art of Playing the Violin</span> (1828), and his wife, Elenor Moss. Taught by his father, he first appeared in public at the age of five, and in 1817 played in London at Drury Lane Theatre in <span class="italic">The Liliputians</span>, as well as in concerts at the Exhibition Rooms in Spring Gardens. From 1821 he studied with Paolo Spagnoletti, and in 1823 with William Crotch and Franz Cramer as one of the first students of the new Royal Academy of Music. He won the silver medal in 1824, and from 1830 to 1837 was solo violinist in Queen Adelaide's private band. At her wish he went in 1832 to Kassel to study with Spohr, and thereafter played with great success in Vienna and elsewhere.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Blagrove appeared as soloist at the Philharmonic Concerts, served as principal violin at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, performed in Louis Jullien's concerts, and made many other appearances in London and elsewhere; in 1839 he played Spohr's concertante for two violins (op. 48) with the composer at the Norwich festival. On 7 November 1835 he inaugurated the first regular series of chamber concerts in London in the Hanover Square Rooms, and on 17 March 1836 founded the Quartett Concerts there with a quartet whose other members were Henry Gattie, Joseph Dando, and Charles Lucas. These concerts, which established chamber music in Victorian life and lasted until 1859, always included a work by Beethoven but also introduced new music; however, Blagrove left in 1843 to found Blagrove's Quartet Concerts. At Queen Victoria's coronation he led the state band. On 17 August 1841 he married Etheldred, daughter of Henry Combe, with whom he had three children. He returned to Germany in 1858, and later played at the lower Rhine festival in D&uuml;sseldorf.<br>
<br>Blagrove's works include some valuable exercises and studies for the violin and a few solos. He was regarded as one of Spohr's best pupils, his tone and technique alike being admirable. Popular with all with whom he came in contact, he was a persevering and successful teacher, notably at the Royal Academy of Music; however, for Walter Macfarren, &#145;though a talented and estimable individual, his temperament, like his violin playing, was decidedly cold&#146;. After his wife's death, on 8 January 1869, Blagrove's health declined. He was presented with a public testimonial in 1872, but that December had a stroke while playing at a private concert, and he died at his home, 224 Marylebone Road, on the 15th. He was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_53946"></a><span class="headword">Richard Manning Blagrove</span>  (1827?&#150;1895), <span class="occ">viola and concertina player</span>, was born in Nottingham and studied the viola with Henry Hill at the Royal Academy of Music. He was also one of the first to study the concertina seriously. He played a solo at the Hanover Square Rooms on 12 March 1842, and later formed a concertina quartet with Giulio Regondi, George Case, and A. B. Sedgwick; their first concert took place in the Hanover Square Rooms on 12 June 1844. Some concertina works were written for him by Sir George Macfarren. He also appeared as a piano accompanist and a violist, succeeding his old teacher as principal viola in the Philharmonic Concerts and at the Three Choirs festivals until 1894. He taught the viola at the Royal Academy until 1890, then founded a series of concerts at Clapham Hall with his sons Stanley and Arthur and his pianist wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Freeth). He died at his home, 23 Orlando Road, Clapham, London, on 21 October 1895.<br>
