<span class="headword">Thynne,  Francis</span>  (1545?&#150;1608), <span class="occ">herald and antiquary</span>, came of a family which also sometimes used the name Boteville, claiming descent in the early seventeenth century from a Ralph Botevile of Church Stretton, Shropshire. The only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27426/', "William Thynne")</script>, the editor of Chaucer, and his wife, Anne Bond, Francis was probably born at Erith, Kent, in 1545, the year before his father's death. He spent some of his early years at Longleat House, Wiltshire, built by his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27421/', "Sir John Thynne")</script>. Francis studied at Tonbridge School under John Procter. He was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 June 1561, but there is no evidence of his staying there very long. He did, however, form lasting friendships with William Lambarde, with whom he collaborated in collecting Anglo-Saxon chronicles, and Thomas Egerton, afterwards lord keeper and lord chancellor. He may have become an attorney, but there is no record of his legal practice. In 1564 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1596), daughter and coheir of Thomas de la River of Brandsby, Yorkshire. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>From his earliest years Thynne was devoted to the collection and study of alchemy, heraldry, medieval history, and antiquities. These activities centred on the transcription and translation of Latin and English Anglo-Saxon chronicles and homilies, lives of the saints, and monumental inscriptions from Kent churches. His earliest work, however, was on alchemy, whose poetical side he pursued as a &#145;lover of wisdom&#146;  (Carlson, 205), aiming to collect rare knowledge in the natural sphere that would complement his antiquarian researches into history. His occult emblems and poems were impractical, however, in the sense that they pursued rare knowledge rather than wealth through the transmutation of metals, and in any case did not reach the level of John Dee's. Thynne's longest alchemical verse, &#145;A Discours uppon the Philosopheres Armes&#146; (1573), was allegorical, referring to biblical and mythological alchemists with numerous coloured illustrations. Since alchemy was an expensive pursuit, it contributed to his early financial problems. Although he maintained his interest in the occult, his last alchemical collection dates from April 1578.<br>
<br>Thynne lived for a time in Poplar, Middlesex, and by 1573 was in Bermondsey Street, Surrey. Now facing severe financial difficulties, he sold off some of the twenty-five Chaucer manuscripts that he had inherited from his father. In January 1574 he also tried to obtain money from his mother's estate. None the less he was imprisoned in the White Lion, Southwark, shortly afterwards for a debt of &pound;100. On 13 March 1576 he wrote an impassioned letter from there to Lord Burghley, requesting help in his distress. His adversaries were his own kinsmen, who under the colour of providing for the assurance of his wife's jointure had withheld from him 200 marks a year over four years. He wrote another long letter to Burghley on the 19th, stating that he was famished and destitute of clothing and means of subsistence. Eventually released, he returned to Longleat to live with Sir John Thynne, having missed the chance to accompany his fellow Kentishman William Brooke, tenth Lord Cobham, as ambassador to Flanders in summer 1578. Following Cobham's return Thynne presented him with a discourse respecting ambassadors dated 8 January 1579. In the meantime he had written again to Burghley in October 1578, begging for employment, and was later evicted from Longleat when his cousin died in 1580. By 1588 he was living on Clerkenwell Green, Middlesex, where he appears to have remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>After the death of Raphael Holinshed in 1580, Thynne, together with Abraham Fleming and John Stow, was employed by John Hooker, who acted as editor, to continue Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. His contributions to this massive undertaking of revision and original work were begun in the period 1579&#150;81. Thynne was responsible for the sections on Scotland, and his most original work consisted of large lists of office-holders. His thirteen substantial articles included &#145;The annales of Scotland, 1571&#150;1586&#146;, &#145;A collection concerning the high constables of England&#146;, &#145;The protectors of England collected out of ancient and modern chronicles&#146;, &#145;The cardinals of England&#146;, &#145;The discourse and catalog of all the dukes of England&#146;, &#145;A treatise of the treasurers of England&#146;, and &#145;The chancellors of England&#146;. Sections of four other contributions&#151;&#145;A discourse of the earles of Leicester&#146;, &#145;The lives of the archbishops of Canturburie&#146;, &#145;A treatise of the Lord Cobhams&#146;, and &#145;The catalog of the lord wardens of the Cinque Ports&#146;&#151;were excised by order of the privy council, owing perhaps to their political sensitivity but more likely because of their tedious length. They were included in the 1728 and later editions. The value of Thynne's work, however, was recognized by the council when it ordered the publication of his critique of Holinshed and of his &#145;Annales of Scotland&#146; (1587).<br>
<br>Thynne became a member of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries in 1591. He read seven papers at its meetings, including discourses on heralds, the antiquity of shires, and the offices of high steward and earl marshal that were published in Hearne's <span class="italic">Collection</span> (2nd edn, 1771). Thynne was a central figure in the society, though he often relied on his fellow members for access to the materials he copied. These included William Camden, Sir Robert Cotton, Joseph Holland, Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham, Lord William Howard, William Lambarde, and John Stow. During this period Thynne, whose father had published an edition of Chaucer in 1532, prepared notes for a commentary on the poet's works. He abandoned it in 1598 when Thomas Speght published an edition. He did, however, criticize Speght's production in a letter of &#145;Animadversions&#146; (1599), and afterwards assisted Speght in producing a revised edition (1602), himself contributing a short poem &#145;Upon the Picture of Chaucer&#146;.<br>
<br>The patronage of Burghley, Egerton, Lord Cobham, and Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury, together with the strength of his scholarly reputation, led to Thynne's being appointed Lancaster herald upon Egerton's nomination by the privy council on 22 April 1602. The support of the council may have owed something to the de luxe, illustrated manuscript editions of Thynne's revised Holinshed contributions that were presented to some of its members&#151;&#145;England's treasurers&#146; to Burghley in 1594, &#145;England's chancellors&#146; to Egerton in 1596, and &#145;Lords Cobham and lords warden of the Cinque Ports&#146; to Cobham in 1598. His work on Anglo-Saxon and medieval chronicles was solid and factual, based on his firm belief in the accuracy of the original manuscripts. The council must have been impressed with the strong protestant bias in his writings, and after 1603 by his criticisms of the disgraced Sir Walter Ralegh's histories as &#145;conjectures&#146;  (Smith Fussner, 97). He demonstrated his loyalty to the crown when on 2 April 1605 he dedicated his &#145;Plea betwene the advocat and the ant-advocat&#146; on the antiquity of royal creations of knighthoods to James I. When Augustine Vincent began his work on England's baronage, he considered Thynne's collections indispensable.<br>
<br>Thynne became a herald at a critical time in the history of the College of Arms, when rife corruption among its members contributed to a flood of fraudulent claims for grants of arms in a period of rapid social mobility. His most widely circulated discourse, and also his last, was a &#145;Discourse of the dutye and office of an heraulde of arms&#146; written in March 1606 for Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, to help him reform the college's practices. He produced a table of its faults along with remedies to resolve them, urging an extension of the legal powers of the earl marshal.<br>
<br>While honours only came to Thynne near the end of his life, they never provided material relief. He spent his life in libraries and his study, and relations with his wife were not good. He wrote later that &#145;thy wife allwaies is but a needefull ill, and best is bad&#146;, and observed that marriage is best when the husband is deaf and the wife blind  (<span class="italic">Emblemes and Epigrames</span>, 59, 78&#150;9). No less personally, in his discourse on heralds he refers to &#145;That cruell Tyrante the unmercyfull Gowte [which] paynefully imprisoned me in my bedd, mannacled my hands, fettered my feete to the sheetes&#146; for nearly three months  (&#145;Discourse&#146;, 230). In June 1606 he wrote to his cousin's grandson Thomas Thynne asking for money to ease his financial difficulties. He died at Clerkenwell Green in November 1608.<br>
<br>Thynne left some 52 works in manuscript, of which 28 were eventually published, and more than 100 copies of medieval texts. His transcript of a valuable account of the peasants' revolt was printed in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> in 1898. His &#145;Catalogue of the lord chancellors of England&#146; came into the possession of Robert Glover, Somerset herald, and Thomas Talbot, clerk of the records in the Tower, and was used by John Philipot, Somerset herald, for his <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Chancellors of England</span> (1636). It had been dedicated to Thynne's friend Sir Thomas Egerton, as were several other manuscript works from the 1580s and 1590s. Most of Egerton's history of Britain in his famous judgment of 1607 on <span class="italic">Colvin's Case</span>, concerning the status in England of persons born in Scotland after the accession of James I, was taken from Thynne's &#145;Comentaries of Britayne&#146; (1587). Both men converted from Catholicism to protestantism in the 1570s.<br>
<br>Thynne's significance lies in the manuscripts he collected, transcribed, and translated. His massive collections, full of lists and catalogues, were later dispersed, to find their way into the Cottonian, Lansdowne, and Stowe collections in the British Library, the Ashmolean in the Bodleian Library, and the Ellesmere in the Huntington Library. His method was one that made his intellectual pursuits of alchemy and antiquarianism complementary. The acquisitive, archaeological approach to recover and understand &#145;the arcana of nature and the arcana of the past&#146; enabled future alchemists and antiquaries to construct new interpretations  (Carlson, 215&#150;16). It was no less so for forward-thinking contemporaries like Sir Francis Bacon.<br>
