</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knight,  Richard Payne</span>  (1751&#150;1824), <span class="occ">art collector and writer</span>, was born at Wormsley Grange, Herefordshire, on 11 February 1751, the eldest son of the four children of Thomas Knight (1697&#150;1764), rector of Bewdley, and his wife, formerly his servant, Ursula Nash (1715&#150;1798), of Bitterley, Shropshire. His two sisters, Barbara (1756&#150;1775) and Ursula (1760&#150;1777), died young but his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15737/', "Thomas Andrew Knight (1759&#150;1838)")</script>, became a renowned horticulturist. Knight took his middle name from his grandmother, Elizabeth Payne, whose husband, the ironmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49106/', "Richard Knight (1659&#150;1745)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47501/', "Knight family (per. c.1680&#150;1897)")</script>] had made one of the first great fortunes of the industrial revolution. Knight inherited much of the family fortune on the death of his uncle Richard Knight in 1765.<h2>
<a name="Educationtravelandarchitecture"></a>Education, travel, and architecture</h2>On account of his poor health Knight was educated at home until his father's death in 1764. Thereafter he was taught by a private tutor, Mr Blyth, at Coleshill, Warwickshire, who introduced him to Greek, at which he excelled. He did not go to university but instead went on the grand tour in 1772, when he came of age and gained control of his fortune. He travelled through France to Florence, Rome, and Naples. On his return to England in 1773 he began to design himself a new house on the estates he had inherited at Downton, Herefordshire. The house, which became known as Downton Castle, was built from 1774 to 1778 by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard; the interior was not completed for another few years. Built on an asymmetrical plan that owed much to the designs of John Vanbrugh, and with embattled parapets that echoed the medieval castles of the Welsh borders, the castle was entered through a large, square tower that housed a circular, domed dining-room based on the Pantheon. Knight's personal involvement with the project&#151;he was kept informed about the building works by his uncle and agent Samuel Nash while he was abroad&#151;allowed him to express his highly individual taste in architecture. The integration of landscape (the site overlooked the wooded valley of the River Teme) and buildings, which was inspired by the paintings of Claude Lorrain, enabled Knight to both conceptualize and realize his ideas on the picturesque. The building of Downton Castle, which preoccupied him throughout his life, was a landmark in English eighteenth-century architecture and set the fashion for castellated buildings, such as William Beckford's Fonthill and John Nash's East Cowes Castle, that typify the picturesque movement.<br>
<br>While work at Downton was in progress Knight again travelled south, and in the late summer of 1776 was touring Switzerland with the landscape painter John Robert Cozens. After some months in Rome, Knight undertook an apparently planned expedition to Sicily in April 1777 with the fashionable German landscape painter Jakob Philipp Hackert and the English shipbuilder and amateur artist Charles Gore (1729&#150;1807). Perhaps under the influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann's ideas on the pre-eminence of Greek art, they aimed to explore the remains of Greek architecture in Italy, most probably with a view to publication. Sailing via the ruined Doric temples at Paestum and the island of Lipari, they visited Patti, Segesta, Selinus and Agrigento, Syracuse and Taormina, and climbed Mount Etna. While Hackert and Gore recorded the various stages of their journey in sketches Knight kept a diary in which he flaunted his knowledge of classical architecture and literature. He also commented on local customs and contemporary political issues, agitating against all forms of &#145;priestcraft&#146;, a favourite topic throughout his life. By July the party was back in Rome, where their sketches were worked up into finished watercolours by Cozens, and Knight reached Paris by the end of the year. The plan of publishing the illustrations seems to have been abandoned a few years later.<h2>
<a name="MPanddilettante"></a>MP and dilettante</h2>Back in England Knight was returned as MP, first for Leominster, in September 1780, and then for Ludlow, in April 1784. He represented Ludlow until 1806 and aligned himself with the opposition whigs against Pitt's government. Sponsored by Charles James Fox, whom he greatly admired, he became a member of Brooks's Club in 1788 and opposed the administration's conduct of the war with France in the 1790s. Although he took part in Westminster affairs Knight pursued the interests developed on his visits to the continent more vigorously than his political duties.<br>
<br>In 1781 Knight was elected a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script> which in 1786 issued his first publication, <span class="italic">An Account of the Remains of the Worship of Priapus</span>. This included the account communicated to the society in 1781 by Sir William Hamilton, British diplomatic representative in Naples, of the wax phallic votive offerings made at the Catholic festival at St Cosmo's shrine at Iserno, Abruzzo. In his discourse that ostensibly examined the survival of phallic worship in Christian ceremonies Knight suggested that sexual symbolism lay at the basis of all religions. He went so far as to identify Christ with Priapus and to declare that the Christian cross was a transformation of a phallic symbol. He wrote in the wake of similar contemporary investigations into the symbolical language of antiquity, in particular the <span class="italic">Recherches sur l'origine, l'esprit, et les progr&egrave;s des arts de la Gr&egrave;ce</span> (1785) by Hugues, Baron d'Hancarville, a former associate and collaborator of Hamilton's in Naples. In spite of the fact that Knight's <span class="italic">Account</span> was published privately it became notorious and was condemned as scandalous, irreligious, and obscene by critics such as T. J. Mathias, William Mavor, and the editors of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, Robert Nares and William Beloe.<h2>
<a name="Aestheticscivilizationandtaste"></a>Aesthetics, civilization, and taste</h2>Perhaps as an antidote to this early <i>faux pas</i> Knight concentrated on fashioning the landscape surrounding his house at Downton in a new, picturesque mode. In pursuing this interest he published <span class="italic">The Landscape: a Didactic Poem</span> in 1794. Ostentatiously quoting both Virgil and Lucretius as his literary models, Knight was dismissive of the pleasingly irregular gardens created by Capability Brown. Instead he advocated the rougher and more &#145;picturesque beauty&#146; of natural landscapes as represented in the paintings of Claude Lorrain, whose works he avidly collected, or those of Dutch and Flemish artists, whom he championed. However, unlike his friend and neighbour Uvedale Price, whose <span class="italic">Essay on the Picturesque</span> was published in the same year, Knight was not really interested in the practical issues of garden design. In shaping his natural surroundings he was concerned rather with their evocative effect on the spectator. He adopted the argument proposed by Archibald Alison in his <span class="italic">Essay on the Nature and Principles of Taste</span> (1790) that aesthetic notions are created by the association of sensory impressions with the emotions and ideas in the mind of the spectator. As with his European Romantic contemporaries, landscape and its representation&#151;which had always occupied a lowly position in the academic hierarchy of artistic genres&#151;provided him with an opportunity to experiment with new ideas and associations.<br>
<br>Knight used landscape as a metaphor to pursue the political and moral issues that preoccupied him: the superstition and bigotry of the Christian church, his claims to freedom of expression, and his opposition to any kind of political and personal oppression. He developed these ideas further in a second long, didactic poem, <span class="italic">The Progress of Civil Society</span> (1796), an encyclopaedic investigation into the history of mankind, progressing from international to national, and personal interrelations between peoples and people. Like Winckelmann, Knight regarded fifth-century Greece as the culmination of civil society and he linked its success to the political and personal freedoms enjoyed by its citizens. In modern times he saw, with Montesquieu, religious superstition, repressive government, and personal bigotry as the cause of mankind's decline. &#145;Missing the mood of the moment&#146;  (Ballantyne, 112), Knight ended his poem with an enthusiastic endorsement of the French Revolution, which, despite his condemnation of the violence of the terror, understandably further antagonized his critics, who attacked him in conservative journals such as the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> and <span class="italic">The Anti-Jacobin</span>. Furthermore he was blackballed from the Literary Society in 1795.<br>
<br>Knight's reputation as a national arbiter of taste was confirmed by his most successful publication, <span class="italic">An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste</span> (1805), which appeared four years after Uvedale Price's <span class="italic">Dialogue on the Distinct Characters of the Picturesque and the Beautiful</span>. Sceptical of the notion that taste could be governed by general rules, Knight&#151;as he had done in the second edition of <span class="italic">The Landscape</span> (1795)&#151;rejected Price's attempt to define &#145;picturesque&#146; as an aesthetic category between the &#145;beautiful&#146; and &#145;sublime&#146; categories that had been established by Edmund Burke. Instead Knight argued for a diversity of tastes, quoting from David Hume's &#145;Of the standard of taste&#146;: &#145;Beauty is no quality in things themselves: it exists merely in the mind, which contemplates them, and each mind perceives a different beauty&#146;  (R. Knight, <span class="italic">An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste</span>, 4th edn, 1808, 16). Guided by Archibald Alison's concept of an &#145;association of ideas&#146;, Knight examined human sensory perception, associations, and emotions, giving priority to the sense of sight. Sight, in response to colour and light, offered the spectator intellectual pleasures through the association of a variety of ideas. These ideas could be evoked either in the contemplation of natural scenery or in works of art, which appealed to the spectator through &#145;tints, happily broken and blended, and irregular masses of light and shadow harmoniously melted into each other&#146; as well as through their associations with literature, philosophy, and the imagination. The &#145;correct&#146; response to these stimuli, however, Knight argued, could be achieved only by the educated spectator&#151;in other words by connoisseurs who had the time, money, and energy to cultivate their tastes and educate their minds. Knight's associationism thus remained specialized and &eacute;litist, a notion suggested perhaps in the portrait by Thomas Lawrence (1794; Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester), which shows Knight, the &#145;arrogant connoisseur&#146;, pointedly staring into space while knowingly leafing through a volume of drawings in his lap.<h2>
<a name="Collectorandscholar"></a>Collector and scholar</h2>Throughout the 1790s Knight devoted considerable time and attention to his Greek studies. Two publications resulted: <span class="italic">An Analytical Essay on the Greek Alphabet</span> (1791) and <span class="italic">Carmina Homerica Ilias et Odyssea</span> (1808; 1820), which contested that Homer was not the author of <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span>. He formed an unrivalled collection of small bronzes (mostly bought from Sir William Hamilton in 1794), coins (principally acquired at the sale of Matthew Duane's collection in 1785), gems, and cameos, which were displayed in a purpose-built gallery in his London house, 3 Soho Square. Sketches of Italian scenes dominated his collection of drawings, which boasted over 150 sketches by Claude. A co-founder of the British Institution, which was established in 1805 to encourage British artists, he enthusiastically promoted the talents of the artist Richard Westall, from whom he commissioned paintings on classical and historical subjects. A selection of his antiquities, together with some of his friend and fellow member of the Society of Dilettanti Charles Townley, were superbly illustrated in <span class="italic">Specimens of Ancient Sculpture</span> (2 vols., 1809&#150;35), to which Knight provided the accompanying commentary and brief history of ancient art. In <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology</span> (1818), originally intended as an introduction to the delayed second volume of <span class="italic">Specimens of Ancient Sculpture</span>, he produced a series of comparative investigations into the sexual symbolism of the art of different religions.<br>
<br>Having stood down from parliament in 1806 Knight made over Downton Castle to his brother, who was married and had a family, in 1808 and retired to a very modest house on the estate, Stonebrook Cottage. Just as he was gradually withdrawing from public engagements Knight sparked a new controversy, this time over the Elgin marbles. When Thomas Bruce, seventh earl of Elgin, brought to Britain the marble sculptures from the Parthenon, Knight declared, without having seen them, that Elgin had &#145;lost his labour&#146;, as they were &#145;not Greek &hellip; but Roman of the time of Hadrian&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life of B. R. H[aydon] &hellip; from his Autobiography and Journals</span>, ed. T. Taylor, 3 vols., 1853, 1.272). When the sculptures were exhibited in London they were the first major works of classical Greek sculpture to have been put on public display in western Europe. Dilettanti and connoisseurs such as Knight who had acquired their expertise on the grand tour to Rome and other Italian cities were familiar only with Roman and Hellenistic copies of original Greek works that were displayed in Italian galleries. They therefore failed fully to appreciate the aesthetic value of the Elgin marbles. Knight in particular thought that they were Hadrianic copies because they did not meet his expectations of Greek art, which he had always extolled as the epitome of human achievement. His lukewarm appreciation, which was shared by William Wilkins and Lord Aberdeen, was at odds with the ecstatic reaction of John Flaxman, Benjamin Robert Haydon, Thomas Lawrence, and Benjamin West to the marbles. In 1816 Knight was called to give evidence to the parliamentary select committee set up to determine their value and legal status; despite his reservations about the marbles' quality he advised that they should be purchased.<br>
<br>Knight's spectacular error of judgement about the Elgin marbles and the subsequent controversy had a catastrophic effect on his reputation. He endured stinging criticism from John Wilson Croker in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and from Haydon, whose evidence had not been heard before the select committee, in an article, &#145;On the judgment of connoisseurs being preferred to that of professional men&#146;, published in both <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> and <span class="italic">The Champion</span>. In a passionate, almost deranged, personal attack, in which he extolled his own piety while labelling his opponent as a demonic fiend, Haydon correctly predicted that the marbles' fame would rise as Knight's sank into oblivion. Knight had already alienated the prince regent by criticizing his architectural taste in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and by supporting the cause of the prince's estranged wife, and unsurprisingly he was not chosen as the new professor of ancient literature at the Royal Academy in 1818. The following year he attracted more controversy when, in his capacity as a magistrate, he ordered the cavalry to break up a demonstration by the colliers at his mines at Clee Hill, in Shropshire.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>Despite his damaged reputation Knight was elected vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries in 1819 (his friend and ally Lord Aberdeen was president). His final publication, <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, a poetic romance, appeared in 1823. He died in London, of an apoplectic stroke, on 23 April 1824 and was buried at Wormsley church, Herefordshire, on 11 May. A trustee of the British Museum since 1814, he bequeathed his collections to the museum so that they could be displayed alongside those of Townley and Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode. Estimated to be worth at least &pound;30,000, his bequest included over 1144 drawings, over 5205 coins, and 800 bronzes.<br>
