<span class="headword">Cargill, Sir  John Traill</span>, first baronet  (1867&#150;1954), <span class="occ">merchant and oil industrialist</span>, was born in Glasgow on 10 January 1867, the second of three sons (there were also two daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47989/', "David Sime Cargill (1826&#150;1904)")</script> and his first wife, Margaret Traill (1840&#150;1872). After attending Glasgow Academy (1878&#150;83), in 1890 he entered the office of the Rangoon agents of the Burmah Oil Company, which his father had founded. He returned to the Glasgow office in 1893, and two years later married Mary Hope Walker (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of George Moncrieff Grierson, a Glasgow commission merchant, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33574/', "Sir James Moncrieff Grierson")</script>; they had one daughter. In 1904, at the early age of thirty-seven, he succeeded his father as chairman of the Burmah Oil Company.<br>
<br>Cargill had suffered a deprived childhood (his mother died when he was five, and his father was strong-willed and much preoccupied with business concerns); Cargill never overcame a diffident manner and a deeply pessimistic outlook. These attributes were a disadvantage at a time when Burmah Oil was becoming a key element in the British government's oil strategy; however, among his able advisers were Sir Boverton Redwood and (Charles) William Wallace. In 1905 Cargill contracted with the Admiralty to supply the Royal Navy with fuel oil from Rangoon. These dealings with Whitehall led to his company's being asked to acquire the important Persian oil concession, then held by William Knox D'Arcy. After three years of arduous prospecting work, Burmah Oil's resident geologist, George Bernard Reynolds, discovered oil in Persia in 1908, and a vast oilfield was subsequently proved. In the following year a new company, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd (later British Petroleum), was registered in London.<br>
<br>The financial burden that Anglo-Persian began to impose on Burmah Oil soon alarmed Cargill. When in 1912 its refining and marketing problems required an injection of a further &pound;2 million, he refused to authorize that sum. Instead, the managing director of Anglo-Persian, Charles Greenway, opened negotiations with the Admiralty for either a loan or the purchase of shares from Burmah Oil. In 1914 the government, at the instigation of Winston Churchill (then first lord of the Admiralty), acquired a controlling stake in Anglo-Persian, which in turn signed a contract to supply the Admiralty with fuel oil.<br>
<br>From 1914 onwards, Robert Irving Watson was head of Burmah Oil's London office. He gradually gained Cargill's trust and took over the day-to-day decisions that the latter wished to delegate. From 1920, when he became managing director, Watson was effectively in charge of the company, and he left to Cargill only the highest policy matters and other public duties normally undertaken by a non-executive chairman. In the same year Cargill was created a baronet for public services. A director of the Glasgow chamber of commerce, Cargill also held directorships of Scottish and other oil and investment companies. He was deputy lieutenant of Glasgow and on the court of Glasgow University, which awarded him an honorary LLD in 1929.<br>
<br>Cargill was tall, with an impressive nose, and despite his reserve he played well his symbolic role as &#145;father&#146; of Burmah Oil. He made periodic visits to Burma and to Persia, and came almost to enjoy the annual general meetings of the company in Glasgow. Having been an accomplished sportsman in his youth, he encouraged sporting and other recreational events in the East with trophies and donations. His great personal integrity made him a trusted figure in Whitehall and in Glasgow alike. He refused to lobby governments on his company's behalf, and angrily condemned underhand dealings by others. He also had a large fund of common sense, successfully arguing that because women had real influence in Burma they should be given the vote.<br>
<br>In 1942, while Cargill was still chairman of Burmah Oil, much of what he had worked for during his life was destroyed when the Japanese invaded Burma: on his orders, the company employees made an end of all its productive assets in Burma, to deny them to the invading armies. In 1943 Cargill handed over the chairmanship to Watson, and retired to the comfort of a nursing home at 19 Great King Street, Edinburgh, where he died on 24 January 1954. He was buried at Hillfoot cemetery, Glasgow. Before his death he had given large benefactions, including donations to universities in both Glasgow and Rangoon.<br>
