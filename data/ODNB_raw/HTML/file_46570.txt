<span class="headword">Ambler,  Geoffrey Hill</span>  (1904&#150;1978), <span class="occ">inventor and air force officer</span>, was born at 10 Kirklands Avenue, Baildon, near Bradford, Yorkshire, on 23 June 1904, the eldest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of Frederick Ambler (1873&#150;1932), a worsted spinner and manufacturer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (1880&#150;1964). His father was the owner of Dumb Mills, Frizinghall, in Bradford, which he ran under the company name of Fred Ambler Ltd. His mother, too, belonged to a family of wool industrialists: her father, Sir James Hill, first baronet (1849&#150;1936), was owner and founder of Sir James Hill &amp; Sons Ltd, a successful wool merchant, and was also the Liberal MP for Bradford Central between 1916 and 1918.<br>
<br>Ambler was educated at Shrewsbury School (1918&#150;22) and Clare College, Cambridge (1922&#150;6), where he studied engineering and economics. He had taken up rowing at school, and excelled at the sport at university. He was a member of three consecutive winning Cambridge boat race crews (1924&#150;6), and in 1925 was president of the Cambridge University Boat Club.<br>
<br>After graduating from Cambridge Ambler joined the family firm, Fred Ambler Ltd, as a trainee manager in 1926. He also took up flying with the Yorkshire Aviation Club, before gaining his Royal Aero Club aviator's certificate in May 1928. He threw himself into flying with the same determination that he had shown as an oarsman, and was commissioned pilot officer in the Auxiliary Air Force in February 1931. Promoted flying officer (1932), flight lieutenant (1933), and squadron leader (1934), he commanded 608 (North Riding) bomber squadron from 1934 to 1938, when he took command of 609 (West Riding) bomber squadron at Yeadon. On 20 June 1940, on the eve of the battle of Britain, he married, at Guiseley parish church, Phoebe (1917&#150;1994), daughter of Edgar Lawson Gaunt, wool merchant, of Hawksworth Hall, Guiseley. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1942 Ambler was a sector commander in Fighter Command, with the ranks of wing commander (1940) and acting group captain (1941). He was awarded the AFC in July 1940. In 1942 he was made commandant of the Royal Observer Corps, and then in 1943 deputy senior air staff officer at Fighter Command, before retiring at the end of the war with the rank of vice air marshal. He was made OBE (1941), CBE (1994), and CB (1946). From 1947 to 1957 he was honorary air commodore of no. 609 squadron.<br>
<br>Returning to the family textile firm after the war, Ambler developed the invention which took his name. Traditionally, turning wool fibres into thread, spinning, was done by spinning wheels. The industrial equivalent involved passing the fibre between rollers of different speeds: slow rollers at the back, faster rollers at the front. The ratio between the roller speeds is called the &#145;draft&#146;. In 1946 Ambler developed a precision unit, the Ambler Superdraft (ASD), which allowed that ratio to rise from around 10 to around 100, thereby dramatically increasing the speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness with which wool could be spun. At around the same time, George F. Raper invented the Raper Auto Leveller (RAL). The two contemporary innovations transformed the worsted spinning industry after the war.<br>
<br>While Ambler was responsible for the engineering principles and design of the ASD, it was <a href="#cosubject_106737">Margaret Hannah [<i>see below</i>]</a> at the University of Leeds who developed an understanding of its theoretical basis. They jointly published an article on the ASD system in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Textile Institute</span> (1950).<br>
<br>Ambler published on the ASD in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Bradford Textile Society</span> (1950&#150;51), though his was more an announcement to his colleagues in industry than an academic paper. In his talk (of which the publication was a report), he told his audience he wanted them to hear of the invention first, though added that he had taken the precaution of securing &#145;overseas patent rights&#146;. In 1960 Ambler and George F. Raper were together awarded honorary fellowships of the Textile Institute in recognition of the contributions they had made to the industry, which were described as &#145;possibly the most important technical advances in wool textile production since the invention of the spinning jenny&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Textile Institute</span>, 51/5, 1960).<br>
<br>Following the success of the ASD Ambler rejoined the family firm and became its chairman. He was well regarded within the industry and served on many committees and boards including the Worsted Spinners' Federation Board, the Wool Textile Delegation, and the Wool (and Allied) Textile Employers' Council. He was also an active member of the local community. In 1949 he was made a deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire, and in 1951 he became regional director of Martin's Bank. In 1966 he awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Leeds. He sold the family firm to Hield Bros, Bradford, in 1974. Ambler died on 26 August 1978 in the Wharfedale Hospital, Otley, Yorkshire, and was survived by his wife and their three daughters. A memorial service was held at Bradford Cathedral.<br>
<br>His collaborator <a name="cosubject_106737"></a><span class="headword">(Dorothy) Margaret Hannah <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Greig]</span></span>  (1922&#150;1999), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born at 10 Roseworth Avenue, Gosforth, Northumberland, on 11 February 1922, the daughter of William Hannah, coal exporter's manager, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hoyland, a teacher. She was educated at Central Newcastle High School for Girls, from where she won a first trust scholarship, which enabled her to enter Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1940. After taking a second in part one (1941) and a first in part two (1943) of the mathematical tripos, she became a scientific officer at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, working in the Air Warfare Analysis Section. There she worked on calculations relating to the navigational accuracy of bombing and, with Bomber Command, on the predicted scattering of debris resulting from a dropped bomb. In 1946 she moved to the Ministry of Works, where she remained until 1948, when she was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Textile Industries at the University of Leeds. On 25 March 1948 she married at Kirkstall parish church, Leeds, William Alexander Greig, a teacher, the son of Thomas Paterson Greig, civil servant. They had three sons and a daughter, and she combined a full-time career in academic research with a growing family.<br>
<br>At Leeds, Hannah (the name under which she published on the ASD) completed her MSc from the University of London and her PhD from the University of Leeds (1950). Leeds University had long enjoyed a close association with the local textile industry, providing research and trained personnel in exchange for funds and support, expertise, samples, and problems in need of investigation. Hannah's work on the ASD involved studying the device and the ratios involved. She succeeded in explaining how it worked mathematically, and from this was able to make improvements to the design. She published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Textile Institute</span> and presented her findings at various conferences including the International Wool Conference in Australia, the proceedings of which were published in 1955. For this same work she was given the Warner memorial award in 1959 by the Textile Institute, an annual award given &#145;for outstanding work in Textile Science and Technology&#146;.<br>
<br>Hannah's husband became head of mathematics at Teesside Polytechnic and in 1959 she left Leeds to take up the post of senior lecturer in mathematics at the Constantine Technical College in Middlesbrough. As D. M. Greig she published a two-volume textbook, co-written with T. H. Wise, entitled <span class="italic">Hydrodynamics and Vector Field Theory</span> (1962 and 1963). In 1964 she moved to the University of Durham to become lecturer and then senior lecturer in mathematics, and wrote another textbook, <span class="italic">Optimisation</span> (1980). She retired in 1986 and died in the Memorial Hospital, Darlington, on 10 June 1999.<br>
<br>An example of the Ambler Superdraft is on display in the Bradford Industrial Museum.<br>
