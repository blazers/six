<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Byng,  Julian Hedworth George</span>, Viscount Byng of Vimy  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 September 1862 at Wrotham Park, Barnet, Hertfordshire, the seventh son and youngest of the thirteen children of George Stevens Byng, second earl of Strafford (1806&#150;1886), and of the four sons and three daughters born to his second wife, Harriet Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1892), younger daughter of Charles Compton Cavendish, first Baron Chesham. His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4264/', "John Byng, first earl of Strafford")</script>, had commanded a brigade at Waterloo and ended his career as a field marshal. His great-great-great-uncle was the unfortunate Admiral John Byng who was shot on his own quarterdeck, as Voltaire put it, &#145;pour encourager les autres&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Financial strictures caused Lord Strafford to impose a regime of strict frugality on his household. Most of Julian's clothes were cast-offs, luxuries unknown. He was educated at home (1867&#150;74), then at Eton College (1874&#150;8), where he was nicknamed Bungo and failed to progress beyond the lower fifth form. Unable to afford a regular army commission, he entered the army at seventeen through the 2nd Middlesex militia. He became an excellent horseman, shot, and cricketer, and developed a love of music and the theatre. Three years later the prince of Wales offered his old friend Strafford a place for Julian in his own regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, an invitation which could not be refused. He was gazetted on 27 January 1883 and, in March, joined them at Lucknow. The 10th was a very expensive regiment, the youngest officer needing a private income of at least &pound;600, most having twice that. Julian's tastes were modest, but he was popular and, by buying ponies cheaply, training them for polo, and selling at a profit, he managed on &pound;200.<br>
<br>Early in 1884 the 10th hussars were on their way home when they were diverted to Suakin to suppress the rebellion in eastern Sudan. In a month-long campaign Byng took part in the historic charge at al-Teb (29 February) and had his horse killed under him at the fierce engagement at Tamai (13 March). He was mentioned in dispatches. He was fortunate in experiencing his first action so early in his career for it gave him both the confidence of personal experience of battle and a compelling incentive to study his profession. On 20 October 1886 he became adjutant of his regiment. Nine days later his father died, leaving him &pound;3500. In his four years in the appointment Byng proved a superb adjutant who achieved much for the lasting welfare of his soldiers.<br>
<br>While stationed at Hounslow, Byng helped Lord Rowton investigate the living conditions of &#145;casual labourers&#146; in the most squalid districts of London, which led to the establishment of &#145;Rowton houses&#146; to provide decent, inexpensive lodgings. In the process he learned far more about how much of the population of Britain lived than was known by most politicians, let alone officers of the army. In 1894 he had graduated from the Staff College, Camberley, where he had helped Colonel G. F. R. Henderson compile his classic work, <span class="italic">Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War</span> (1898). After three years as a squadron leader in his regiment, he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general (DAAG) of Aldershot command. He was promoted captain in 1889 and major in 1898.<h2>
<a name="SouthAfrica18991902"></a>South Africa, 1899&#150;1902</h2>Byng arrived in South Africa with General Sir Redvers Buller's headquarters on 9 November 1899, to be met with orders to raise and command a new regiment of colonial irregulars, the South African light horse. Tough, irreverent, and natural horsemen, his new troopers were far from being the disciplined and highly trained hussars he knew, but Byng recognized their value as a military asset. Readily adapting to their informal ways, he soon earned their respect. Helped by his sense of humour and a sure military instinct, he became a leader of irregular cavalry of the highest quality. In the fighting along the Tugela River, Winston Churchill acted as his galloper. Later he was employed in command of a column, then of a group of columns, until March 1902 when he returned to England. Byng received the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1900 and of colonel in February 1902, and was five times mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1902 Byng married Marie Evelyn (1870&#150;1949), only child of Sir Richard Charles Moreton of Church Crookham, Hampshire. At the war's end he was appointed to command the 10th hussars at Mhow in the central provinces of India. There he suffered two bitter disappointments. Badly treated miscarriages resulted in his wife's being unable to bear children. Then in a polo accident in January 1904, his right elbow was so badly broken and dislocated that it was feared he would have to leave the army. He returned to England and after months of painful treatment, was pronounced fit for service in the field.<br>
<br>In 1904 Byng formed the army's new school for cavalry at Netheravon which he commanded until 1905 when he was promoted to command the 2nd cavalry brigade at Canterbury. He was appointed CB in 1906. In 1907 he moved to the 1st cavalry brigade at Aldershot which he commanded until 1 April 1909 when he was promoted major-general and placed on half pay until October 1910 when he took command of the territorial East Anglian division. In the interim he was part-time editor of the <span class="italic">Cavalry Journal</span> and became the first district commissioner for north Essex for the Boy Scout movement, which he helped organize with characteristic thoroughness. For the first time Byng had a home of his own, Newtown Hall, at Dunmow in Essex, which was then something of a literary centre. He formed lasting friendships with London editors and the well-known writers who were his neighbours. He read extensively and welcomed the opportunity of broadening his already wide range of interests. In October 1912 Byng was appointed to command the force in Egypt. When war broke out in 1914 he was recalled to command the 3rd cavalry division.<h2>
<a name="19141918"></a>1914&#150;1918</h2>In the first battle of Ypres Byng's division gave brilliant support to the 1st corps and was repeatedly called upon to restore ugly situations at short notice and in the most unfavourable conditions. Byng proved as cool, determined, and resourceful in difficult circumstances as he had been in South Africa. In March 1915 he was appointed KCMG and in May he took command of the cavalry corps in the temporary rank of lieutenant-general. Three months later he was sent to Gallipoli to command the 9th corps at Suvla. General Sir Ian Hamilton's request for Byng to command the landing force there had been refused, and now that the operation had gone disastrously wrong he was being sent to retrieve it. It was too late. He set out immediately to make his corps' position tenable and, within a week of arrival, began to study the problem of evacuation. He reasoned that the Gallipoli operations were yielding few strategic benefits, that the army must either drive on and seize its final objectives, for which they did not have the resources, or that the force should be withdrawn and used elsewhere. Alone of the senior commanders, he considered that withdrawal need not be costly provided it was carried out before more German help to the Turkish enemy arrived and before the weather broke. His optimism and enthusiasm were infectious and turned the outlook of other commanders from an acceptance of the inevitability of disaster to a belief in the possibility of success. The withdrawal, without casualties, was completely successful and Byng was appointed KCB (1916).<br>
<br>In February, after a brief spell in Egypt in the Suez Canal defences, Byng was sent to command the 17th corps in France. Three months later he was ordered to replace another British officer, Lieutenant-General Sir E. A. H. Alderson, as commander of the Canadian corps, no Canadian yet being ready for the appointment. Simultaneously he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general for distinguished services in the field. Unlike most corps of the British expeditionary force (BEF), which were simply headquarters to which divisions were assigned as required, the Canadian corps was a cohesive force consisting permanently of its national divisions. Its commander controlled its administration and preparation for battle in a way not open to his counterparts in the British army. Within a week, on 2 June, Byng had to deal with near disaster when the Germans captured Mount Sorrel and Hill 62 which overlooked Ypres. Local counter-attacks failed, but on 11 June the lost ground was recaptured in an expensive counter-offensive.<br>
<br>Byng had an extraordinary gift for impressing the troops under his command with his friendly personality and sense of humour. He soon gained not only the confidence but the affection of the Canadian corps where every man came to recognize the tall figure in crumpled uniform and worn boots. Nowhere in the world at war was there such a large formation in which the links between commander and soldiers were so strong. The corps distinguished itself on the Somme, in the battle of Flers-Courcelette in mid-September, and at the end of the month in the Thiepval Ridge operations; but its greatest feat under Byng's command was the capture, in April 1917, of Vimy Ridge, the most dominant and tactically important feature on the whole of the western front.<br>
<br>In June of that year, Byng, although loath to leave his Canadians, was appointed to command the Third Army in succession to General Sir Edmund Allenby. Within days of his arrival he became absorbed in planning the most daring and original operation yet undertaken by the British on the western front, the Cambrai offensive. Conceived as a diversion to distract the enemy from the main British attack near Ypres, its objects were to capture the wooded heights above Bourlon and roll up the German front towards the Sensee marshes to the north; at the same time it was to thrust eastwards, capture Cambrai, and exploit in the direction of Valenciennes. The key elements were surprise, the use of a massive force of tanks to open gaps in the enemy wire, the employment of &#145;predicted fire&#146; from massed artillery without preliminary registration, the use of aircraft to neutralize enemy batteries and interdict the battlefield, the swift breakthrough of the enemy defences by infantry, and the launch of cavalry divisions into the enemy rear areas. Planned to take place in October, the operation depended for its success on the Ypres offensive being in progress. In the event, the government ordered the reserves essential to the plan to be sent to Italy, and on 12 November Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig halted the Ypres offensive but ordered the Cambrai operation to take place.<br>
<br>The first stage of the assault, launched on 20 November, was brilliantly successful, but serious setbacks occurred (including the last-minute arrival of German troops freed by the collapse of Russia), and the available reserves could not maintain the momentum. At the end of the month the Germans counter-attacked the salient created by the British advance. On the north they were held but they broke the southern flank and were only stopped by hurriedly organized counter-attacks.<br>
<br>As an operation Cambrai was a disappointment but it broke the mould of the accepted tactics of 1917. At that time there was no significant mobile force but cavalry: tanks were unreliable mechanically, too short in range, and too few in numbers. It is from Byng's attempt to exploit their potential in combination with other arms that Cambrai derives its influence on the history of warfare. Into a single operation, meticulously planned, he brought together the secret concentration of an overwhelming force of guns and armour, &#145;silent registration&#146; by the artillery, the engagement of ground targets by the air force, deceptive measures, including simulated attacks and dummy tanks spread over a front of 30 miles, the breakthrough of the enemy's defences by tanks and infantry, the plan for a deep thrust into the enemy's rear by a mobile force and, above all, surprise. Notwithstanding the obvious technical limitations, it was the prototype of the wide-ranging battles of the Second World War.<br>
<br>The German offensive of March 1918 fell heavily upon the Third Army, though less so than on the Fifth on its right. The Third put up a stubborn resistance, lost relatively little ground, and smashed the offensive near Arras. Byng had, however, to make a rapid withdrawal, which got temporarily out of hand, from the remains of the Cambrai salient. That autumn the Third Army played a great part in the offensive which decided the issue of the war. Its first attack was launched on 21 August. By a series of heavy blows, in conjunction with the Fourth Army on its right and the First Army on its left, it drove the enemy back to the Hindenburg line and, on 27 September, broke that position. In the space of eighty days it advanced 60 miles&#151;a fast pace for that war&#151;won eighteen significant battles, and took 67,000 prisoners and 800 guns.<br>
<br>On only two subjects have Byng's judgement as a commander been brought into question: his aims in the battle of Cambrai and his delay in evacuating the Cambrai salient in March 1918. It has been suggested in the <span class="italic">History of the Great War</span> that in the former case he was unduly optimistic, refusing to modify an ambitious plan when it was found impossible to put at his disposal resources as large as originally intended because they had been used up at Ypres and in Italy. Yet Sir Douglas Haig, the commander-in-chief, approved Byng's plans for the attack at each stage of their development and was present with him at critical times during the operation. It was Haig who ordered the operation to take place when it did, and to continue when the hoped-for breakthrough was not achieved.<br>
<br>Byng's judgement may have been more questionable in the second case, but his conduct of the final offensive of 1918 established him as a field commander of the first rank. His was the largest of Britain's five field armies and he controlled its operations with a sureness of touch derived from four years of active operations. Its successes reflected his meticulous planning and a personal flair in which was combined an instinct for surprise and a faculty for forecasting the actions of the enemy. His willingness to break free from orthodoxy, to accept new weapons and concepts of operations, led to the plan for the Cambrai offensive which so influenced commanders in the Second World War. In 1919 Byng, who had been promoted general in 1917, was appointed GCB, raised to the peerage (August) as Baron Byng of Vimy, and received the thanks of parliament and a grant of &pound;30,000. Other honours came his way. From Canada there was a commission as an honorary general (1920) and there were honorary doctorates from Cambridge (1919) and Oxford (1931). In March 1919 he was offered the southern command, but he requested retirement to make way for a younger man. While he was in Egypt in 1913 his wife had bought Thorpe Hall at Thorpe-le-Soken. There she created a beautiful home and a widely famed garden and Byng was able to enjoy his favourite sport of shooting. In the interest of his soldiers he took on the trying and delicate task of administering the United Services Fund.<h2>
<a name="Canada"></a>Canada</h2>In June 1921 Byng was appointed governor-general of Canada where already he was widely popular. Yet even those who had hoped for the most from it were astonished by the success which he made of his mission. Well supported by his wife, he kept up the requisite state and entertained on a large scale, but was otherwise unconventional, mixing with people as had none of his predecessors. He travelled widely and developed a talent for making brief and telling speeches devoid of the platitudes too common on official occasions. The theme to which he constantly returned was the need for unity in the dominion and for eliminating the bitterness of political strife. In his last year there was a widespread desire that he should serve a second term, but this he would not consider.<br>
<br>In June 1926, shortly before he was due to return to England, Byng became involved in a painful political crisis. The prime minister, W. L. Mackenzie King, had in the previous September sought and obtained from the governor-general a dissolution of parliament on the understanding that, if after the election King met the Canadian House of Commons and subsequently was unable to carry on, the leader of the opposition should be given the chance to form a government. The general election which followed seriously weakened King's position, and he had since governed with his minority Liberal Party dependent on outside support. Now, having to face a vote of censure certain to go against him, King asked for a second dissolution. Byng refused it and called upon Arthur Meighen, leader of the Conservatives, the strongest party in the house, to form a government. In less than a week, having seen the censure motion passed, the new prime minister was defeated. Byng then granted Meighen a dissolution, and in the subsequent election the Liberals were victorious.<br>
<br>Though accused during the election of favouring Meighen over King, Byng had behaved with complete impartiality. He refused King's advice to dissolve parliament at a time when to do so would have prevented its voting on an outstanding motion censuring the government. He accepted Meighen's advice to dissolve parliament, after it had been shown that neither party could govern. Byng's last days in Canada were clouded by this episode but it was with affection and deep regret that the people of Canada said farewell to him.<br>
<br>Until King's second request for dissolution no prime minister in Britain or Canada had attempted to challenge the right of the crown to refuse unconstitutional advice. Byng's response to it confirmed that residual power was real and deterred similar situations from developing elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Byng contended that the governor-general should represent the crown, not the British government, and that the constitutional relationship between him and the prime minister of Canada was the same as that between the sovereign and the British prime minister. The Imperial Conference, held shortly after Byng's return to England in 1928, confirmed this principle.<h2>
<a name="MetropolitanPolice"></a>Metropolitan Police</h2>In June 1928 Byng was asked by the home secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, to become chief commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. There was a need at Scotland Yard for a leader of great character and prestige: the public was worried by apparent inefficiency and corruption within the police, and morale within the force was low. Byng tried to excuse himself on the grounds of age and indifferent health, but strong pressure was put upon him and he gave way. The appointment was vigorously attacked on class grounds by the Labour opposition in parliament&#151;virulently by the left-wing press. Yet so effective was his leadership of the police that when, a year later, a Labour government took office, they refused to accept his offer of resignation, and assured him of their full confidence and support.<br>
<br>Byng's reforms were widespread and fundamental. He retired inefficient senior officers, tightened up discipline, instituted a system of promotion based on merit, and reorganized the structure of the force to correspond with the distribution of London's population. He reorganized the system of patrolling, abolishing the regular schedules of policemen's beats to which criminals became accustomed. He instituted police telephone boxes, greatly extended the use of police cars, and established a central information room to control them by radio. Yet his reforms were not resented in the force, over which he established as strong a hold as he had done over every other body of men he had commanded. Byng's health deteriorated towards the end of his term of office and he resigned in September 1931.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Byng had been appointed GCMG in August 1921 and advanced to a viscountcy in June 1926 but the award which gave him the greatest satisfaction was that of a field marshal's baton in October 1932. He died suddenly on 6 June 1935 at Thorpe Hall of an inoperable abdominal blockage, and was buried on 8 June at the church of Beaumont-cum-Moze in Essex which, as a devoted Anglican, he had regularly attended. He and his wife having had no children, Byng's peerage became extinct.<br>
<br>Byng had developed, through careful self-preparation and experience, from a somewhat shy young officer, avoiding when he could all society except that most congenial to him, to a public figure at home in any society and able to impress his personality on multitudes. He was one of the most intellectual of Britain's wartime commanders and his qualities of leadership were unquestionably high. Unlike the popular conception, his headquarters in the field was notoriously simple. He had a deep and natural empathy with his men, a genius for friendship, and many friends in all walks of life. Unlike other generals, he refused to write his memoirs&#151;he ordered his papers to be destroyed on his death&#151;or to criticize others, which may account for the lack of wide recognition, until recently, of his true worth. He never held independent command in the field, and on that basis he cannot be judged. On the other hand, beyond being thoroughly competent and personally inspiring, he was gifted with an open-mindedness and imagination which rose above the pervading orthodoxy of the First World War.<br>
<br>Byng's greatest weakness was a guileless belief in the integrity of mankind, of which some less scrupulous occasionally took advantage. But coupled with his massive integrity, it was the basis of the trust and devotion of his soldiers and the root of his reputation as a battlefield leader.<br>
