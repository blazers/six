<span class="headword">Hardy,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1832), <span class="occ">horologist</span>, was apparently Scottish, but nothing is known of his place and date of birth nor of his early life and training. Yet by 1805 he was sufficiently renowned to be one of the fifteen eminent watchmakers recruited by the board of longitude to assess the merits of the rival chronometric claims of John Arnold (<i>d</i>. 1799) and Thomas Earnshaw (1749&#150;1829), and in the following years he regularly received awards from the Society of Arts for ingenious inventions in horology. None ever saw general adoption, due largely to trade conservatism, but the best must be recorded here.<br>
<br>Hardy was the first practical horologist in England, and probably anywhere, to make comparatively accurate cycloidal cutters for wheels and pinions. His patterns were supplied to the famous Thomas Leyland (1790&#150;1861) of Prescot, Lancashire, who, according to D. S. Torrens, produced without doubt the finest horological gearings that have ever been known. At the time of the 1862 International Exhibition in London the great Victorian horologist Charles Frodsham wrote: &#145;the train of wheel-work in Hardy's regulators is among the best in England, and the shape of the wheels and pinions makes the most perfect gearing I have ever witnessed&#146;  (Frodsham, 10). Hardy's career reached its apogee in 1811 thanks to the truly remarkable performance of an astronomical regulator clock with a very delicate detached spring-pallet escapement made for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne, had in 1807 tested its prototype at Greenwich with most promising results. Unfortunately, he died before the new regulator and a new mural circle by Edward Troughton could be used together. His successor, John Pond, was at first satisfied with Hardy's clock even though its escapement needed frequent cleaning by its maker.<br>
<br>Good reports reached the ears of astronomers and scientists everywhere. Among the first was Ferdinand Hassler, a distinguished Swiss geodesist who had emigrated to America in 1805 and who in 1812 was in London seeking equipment for a survey of the east coast of the United States. He ordered from Hardy two regulators of the Greenwich type, together with box chronometers and special timers. Hardy's reputation was established. He received orders for regulators and chronometers from both observatories and amateur astronomers. In 1820 outstandingly good clock rates were recorded at Greenwich, Sandhurst, and Vilna. The celebrated astronomer William Pearson acquired a Hardy regulator in 1816 and published an illustrated description of the type in 1829. Hassler had done the same in 1824.<br>
<br>In 1823 Pond moved Hardy's regulator to the transit room, thus making it the most important clock in the world. In 1830, however, his records show that it had &#145;accelerated on its mean by nearly 4s per day&#146;. Hardy, perhaps ill, ignored two notices to attend. Had he then simply cleaned the escapement, events would almost certainly have turned out differently. In his absence his detached escapement was removed by the envious E. J. Dent and replaced by a conventional deadbeat one. Hardy's regulator at the Cape observatory soon suffered the same indignity. Pearson's clock and those at Vilna, Cambridge, and Fyvie continued to perform well although, one by one (and in one case as late as <i>c</i>.1990), their fragile escapements were broken by inexpert handling. Hardy died at his home, 5 Wood Street, Cold Bath Square, Clerkenwell, London, on 12 November 1832.<br>
