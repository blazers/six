<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  James</span>  (1775&#150;1851), <span class="occ">author</span>, son of James Sedgwick of Westminster, was born in London. He matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, on 30 October 1797, but did not graduate. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 23 January 1801. At this time he published several legal works, including <span class="italic">Remarks on the Commentaries of Sir William Blackstone</span> (1800), and edited the sixth edition of Sir Geoffrey Gilbert's <span class="italic">Law of Evidence</span> (1801). He wrote for the <span class="italic">Oxford Review</span> anonymously in 1807 and 1808. In 1809 he was appointed a commissioner of excise at Edinburgh, and in 1811 chairman of the excise board. In 1815 he was nominated by the Treasury to a seat on the London excise board, but this appointment was cancelled in consequence of the prince regent's having promised the marchioness of Hertford that Colonel Sir Francis Hastings Doyle should have the first vacancy. By way of compensation Sedgwick was appointed examiner of the droits of Admiralty accounts, at his previous salary of &pound;1500 a year. He was promoted on 25 August 1817 to chairman of the board of stamps. At the beginning of 1818 he undertook an inquiry into the conduct of the stamp revenue in Scotland, and discovered great abuses. His effort to secure the permanent dismissal of the officer to whom the disorder was attributable proved, to his irritation, unsuccessful. At the same time he offended Lord Liverpool and the government by publishing <span class="italic">Observations</span> and writing on the inquiry in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. His fourteen letters were reissued in the form of three pamphlets. When, in 1826, the board of stamps was dissolved, he was the only member denied a pension. In 1828, however, he received a small retiring allowance of &pound;400 a year.<br>
<br>Sedgwick thus had a grievance, and the greater part of the rest of his life was spent in memorializing successive administrations or petitioning parliament. In 1845 he published a further series of aggrieved letters, including one attacking Sir John Easthope, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, for it had ceased to print his complaints. He was a director of the county fire office. Sedgwick died on 26 January 1851 at his house, 3 Church Street, Kensington, London, from the effects of a fall in Queen Street, Bloomsbury. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He was married, and left one daughter.<br>
