<span class="headword">Wills family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1786&#150;1928), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_50561"></a><span class="headword">Henry Overton [i] Wills</span>  (1761&#150;1826)<span class="occ"></span>, who in 1786 became a partner in a small tobacco business known as Wills, Watkins &amp; Co. of Castle Street, Bristol.<br>
<br>The family origins of Henry O. [i] Wills are obscure. He was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and his father is believed to have been a watchmaker. Why he chose to enter the tobacco industry is unknown, but his choice of partner was probably connected with his religious affiliation since Watkins, like him, was an active Independent (Congregationalist). In any event, it was an opportune time to enter the tobacco industry: tobacco consumption was growing steadily and the amount of capital a tobacco manufacturer needed was moderate by contemporary standards. From the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, the economic status of Bristol began to decline as the forces of economic change undermined the traditional and predominantly merchant basis of its prosperity. Unlike many other industries in the city, however, tobacco did not disappear, because the industry in the country at large remained small-scale and much dependent on local markets.<br>
<br>H. O. [i] Wills proved to be exceptionally skilful, and through a series of partnerships and amalgamations he expanded the firm to the point where by 1820 it was one of the three largest of the ten tobacco manufacturers in the city. While he turned his nonconformist network to good business advantage, he benefited financially, also, from strong Anglican connections through his marriage to Ann Day in 1790. He and his wife had three sons and two daughters. Following his death on 2 December 1826 H. O. [i] Wills was succeeded by his second son, <a name="cosubject_61718"></a><span class="headword">William Day Wills</span>  (1797&#150;1865)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 6 June 1797, and his youngest son, <a name="cosubject_61719"></a><span class="headword">Henry Overton [ii] Wills</span>  (1800&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span>; but because another partner, William Ditchett, remained in the business, the firm did not adopt its subsequently world-famous style of W. D. and H. O. Wills until 1831, and then only for two years, since in 1833 it amalgamated with another firm to become Ricketts, Wills &amp; Co. This merger made the firm one of the largest in the country. The style of W. D. and H. O. Wills returned in 1847, when the Ricketts family retired from the business.<br>
<br>The market for tobacco at that time consisted mainly of smoking tobacco, with snuff and cigars being very much minority tastes. Firms sold various types of smoking tobacco under their name as the distinguishing feature and guarantee of quality, but retail tobacconists made up their own blends from these tobaccos to suit local tastes. In 1846 the Willses hit upon the idea of giving brand names to certain of its tobaccos, and the first two brands&#151;Best Bird's Eye and Bishop Blaze&#151;made their appearance on new year's day 1847. This was a major breakthrough which gave Wills a market advantage and it represented a shift in market power away from specialist retail tobacconists to the manufacturer.<br>
<br>By the standards of the time the Wills brothers were wealthy, and, while William and Henry now lived in comfortable style, it was at a level somewhat below the limits of their income, a characteristic that was to mark successive generations. Both entered local politics as Liberals; and from the 1840s onwards both made significant benefactions towards the establishment of new Congregational churches in the city and to associated charitable activity. In 1820 William Day Wills married Mary, daughter of Robert Steven of Glasgow and Camberwell, Surrey. They had one surviving child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36940/', "Sir William Henry Wills (1830&#150;1911)")</script>. W. D. Wills died at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on 13 May 1865. His brother Henry Overton [ii] Wills, who remarried after the death of his first wife, had eleven children surviving out of fifteen by 1851 and the total eventually reached eighteen. However, only those male children born to his first wife succeeded to the family business. These included Henry Overton [iii] Wills (1828&#150;1911), Sir Edward Payson Wills (1834&#150;1910), and Sir Frederick Wills (1838&#150;1909): all four became partners in the firm. Their father died at 3 Hillside, Cotham, Bristol, on 23 November 1871.<br>
<br>Control of the business now devolved to these members of the family. William Henry became the senior partner by virtue of the fact that he inherited all his father's share in the business. W. D. and H. O. Wills was subsequently transformed from being a highly successful firm among a number in the industry into the dominant tobacco manufacturer in the United Kingdom, such that it proved capable in 1901&#150;2 of beating off a powerful challenge to its position from the mighty American Tobacco Company. The question remains as to how it was Wills that had achieved this phenomenal success rather than another firm in the industry.<br>
<br>During the 1860s and 1870s the firm paid close attention to selling, and steadily improving the quality of its product. Moreover, as sales grew, the scale of capital required to finance the duty (which was approximately equivalent to four times the cost of raw leaf) increased proportionately, and it accounted for a large part of the &pound;300,000 required to carry on the business in 1880; in turn, this represented a major hurdle to would-be new entrants. Growth in the market was matched by the now almost continuous extension of premises and the opening of a new factory at Bedminster, Bristol, in 1886. Premises had been acquired in London in 1864 and these were steadily added to. An entirely new departure occurred in 1883, when a bonded factory was opened in Bristol to facilitate Wills's growing export trade.<br>
<br>William Henry Wills was chairman of the company and its main business strategist until the formation of the Imperial Tobacco Company in 1901. Nevertheless, from the late 1870s onwards he began to develop a public career, and in 1880 he entered parliament as a Liberal member for Coventry. Having been educated at Mill Hill School and retaining his nonconformist connections, William Henry was more outgoing and metropolitan in outlook than his cousins. By 1880 each of this generation was possessed of a fortune of &pound;100,000 in terms of book values, though in market values the figure would be &pound;300,000. All of them enjoyed comfortable lifestyles. William Henry purchased a country estate and a large motor yacht. Through his wide business and political connections he became a leading figure in commercial circles in London. H. O. [iii] Wills purchased a small estate in Norway, where, partly for reasons of ill health, he spent a great deal of time during the remainder of what proved to be a long life.<br>
<br>From the early 1880s increasing responsibilities in the firm were assumed by members of the fourth generation. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36939/', "Sir George Alfred Wills (1854&#150;1928)")</script>, the elder son of H. O. [iii] Wills, emerged as the leading figure, though he was well complemented by the second son, <a name="cosubject_61720"></a><span class="headword">Henry Herbert Wills</span>  (1856&#150;1922), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer</span>. Born on 20 March 1856, Harry Wills was educated at Mill Hill School and Clifton College. He trained as a pupil engineer with Avonside Engineering Co. and also studied engineering at Bristol University College. In 1878 he was appointed engineer of W. D. and H. O. Wills. In 1886 he married Mary Monica, daughter of Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen; they did not have any children.<br>
<br>Wills's leading position in the industry resulted in its attracting offers of exclusive use of new processes and techniques. In 1885, for example, it secured exclusive rights to the use in the tobacco industry of an airtight tin, which significantly improved the keeping qualities of tobacco, an especially valuable thing in the export trade. But what was to prove the most dramatic technical advance occurred in 1883, when Wills acquired exclusive patent rights in the United Kingdom to an American invention, the Bonsack cigarette-making machine, to which there was no effective competitor. The cost was &pound;4000, and this purchase must rank as one of the outstanding buys in British industrial history.<br>
<br>Wills had first introduced handmade cigarettes in 1860, but cigarettes remained a minuscule element in total sales. Even with a prospect of cheaper, machine-made cigarettes, the expectation was that sales would remain small. Nevertheless, the Bonsack machine could produce cigarettes at a quarter of the cost of the handmade alternative, and with minor developments machine-made cigarettes would be of superior quality. Wills did not, however, move quickly to exploit its technical advantage, which can be explained mainly in terms of the partners' doubts about the potential scale of the market and the concern of Frederick Wills, in particular, that handworkers would be put out of employment. Cigarette sales began to grow quite fast in the 1880s, however, but at 3<i>d</i>. for ten they remained significantly more expensive than smoking tobacco. Eventually, in mid-1888, George Wills proposed that a new cigarette should be produced that would retail at 1<i>d</i>. for five. With the enthusiastic backing of Harry Wills (who had trained as an engineer) and, more importantly, with the support of William Henry, the resistance of the other partners was overcome and two brands were launched&#151;Wild Woodbine and Cinderella. Their success was phenomenal, that of Woodbine outstandingly so; and it is fair to claim that Woodbine became the most famous cigarette brand of all time. The effect of cigarette sales on Wills's profits was dramatic. From &pound;66,500 in 1887, profits rose to &pound;788,000 in 1901.<br>
<br>By 1901 Wills accounted for 12 per cent of UK tobacco sales by weight. Of these sales, 64 per cent was accounted for by cigarettes, which was equivalent to 55 per cent of UK cigarette sales, yet cigarettes still accounted for only 14.5 per cent of UK tobacco sales by weight. On the face of it, therefore, Wills hardly appears dominant. But the crucial fact is that Wills had a virtual monopoly of the cigarette market, and cigarettes had become up to ten times more profitable than smoking tobaccos. At 1<i>d</i>. for five the gross profit on a packet of Woodbine in 1900 was as little as just under one farthing because of the large amount of duty in the price. But Wills's profits on cigarettes were so high because of huge turnover and the need for even money pricing.<br>
<br>The formation of the Imperial Tobacco Company in 1901 was the outcome of a trial of strength between the American Tobacco Company, under its flamboyant president, James Buchanan Duke, and a combination of British manufacturers. By aggressive business tactics, Duke had succeeded in building American Tobacco not only into by far the largest American tobacco manufacturer but also into one of the largest corporations in the United States and, therefore, in the world. In 1900 he decided to make a bid for the dominant share of the lucrative UK market. To achieve his end he acquired Wills's strongest competitor, the Liverpool firm of Ogden. He immediately announced his intention of capturing the British and European markets and declared that the large sum of &pound;6 million had been set aside for this purpose. The British trade was thrown into fearful agitation and firms petitioned Wills to take the lead in resisting the American invasion.<br>
<br>The possibility of selling out to Duke was seriously considered by some of the partners, but, under the decisive lead of William Henry and George, Wills resolved to form an amalgamation of thirteen leading UK tobacco manufacturers and to fight American Tobacco. The name Imperial Tobacco Company was deliberately chosen to appeal to patriotic and imperial sentiments. The constituent firms agreed not to reveal their annual profits (on which the capitalization of the new company would be calculated and distributed) until all other matters had been settled. When disclosure finally occurred, the other firms were astounded at Wills's profits, which meant that the Wills family controlled 60 per cent of the new company.<br>
<br>The &#145;tobacco war&#146; raged, but the British line held. Towards the end of 1902, in view of the mounting losses, Duke came to the conclusion that he could not win and that the better option was to negotiate a peace. The warring parties met in late 1902 and quickly came to an amicable agreement. The main terms were that American Tobacco agreed to withdraw from the UK market and Imperial Tobacco agreed not to enter the American market. In their own markets each company acquired exclusive trading rights in the other's brands. The sale of Ogdens to Imperial Tobacco gave American Tobacco a substantial minority interest in the former; and in a grand declaration that would have done justice to Pope Alexander VI in the fifteenth century, trade in the rest of the world was to be served by a new UK registered company, the British American Tobacco Company, the ownership of which was to be divided between American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco in the proportions of two-thirds to one-third.<br>
<br>The outcome was in part a tribute to the business vision of Sir William Henry Wills and the skills of his younger cousins George and Harry; and also to the sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39035/', "John Player")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48110/', "J. D. Player")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48111/', "W. G. Player")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39035/', "Player, John")</script>] of the Nottingham tobacco firm who were responsible for advertising. In larger part it reflected the near monopoly that Wills had secured in the UK cigarette market, together with the strength of the smoking brands owned by the British firms. Testimony to Wills's dominance came from Duke himself when he declared: &#145;I did hope that I should be able to force you to reduce your prices, and if you had I should have had you, but you refused to do so and I was therefore beaten&#146;  (Alford, 275).<br>
<br>The assured financial success of the new company continued to bring enormous rewards, as shown by the estates of the senior members of the Wills family who died between 1909 and 1911: these totalled well over &pound;13 million. In addition, Harry Wills died at his home, St Vincent's, Clifton Park, Bristol, on 11 May 1922 leaving an estate valued at &pound;2.75 million. A further measure of these riches is that at his death in 1928 Sir George Wills's estate was valued at &pound;10 million. These princely fortunes made the family one of the richest in the land. At the time of their deaths these men stood at the head of the Imperial Tobacco Company, which ranked as the seventeenth largest industrial enterprise in the world.<br>
<br>Moreover, both this generation of the family and the previous one had made substantial benefactions to a variety of causes, many, though not all, associated with the city of Bristol. In 1908, for example, H. O. [iii] Wills gave &pound;100,000 which enabled the university college at Bristol to become the fully independent University of Bristol. Lord Winterstoke (Sir W. H. Wills) donated &pound;35,000 to the new university and, earlier in 1904, he had made a gift to the city of a museum and art gallery. Furthermore, between 1913 and 1920 Harry Wills and his brother Sir George donated a further &pound;500,000 to the university, and this was substantially added to in following years. The scale of the family's gifts to the University of Bristol can be judged from the fact that in terms of prices a hundred years later their value would run into hundreds of millions of pounds. The other benefaction of princely proportions was Harry's gift of &pound;1.5 million for the building and endowment of the St Monica's Home of Rest in Bristol: somewhat contrary to family tradition this home was for gentlewomen who were Anglicans with high-church leanings, which reflected the Anglo-Catholic beliefs of Harry's wife, Dame Monica. These were the largest of a wide variety of charitable gifts made by members of the family.<br>
<br>The business success of the Wills family is, in an obvious sense, beyond question. Much more difficult to assess is the extent to which this achievement was the reward to their exceptional business talents or whether it was relatively easily come by. The picture that emerges is of a family that succeeded in maintaining a solid level of business ability through successive generations, and that during the period of exceptional opportunity in the 1880s those directing the firm were able, with an element of luck that is commonly an ingredient of business success, to mobilize the firm's steadily accumulated resources to achieve phenomenal rewards. Even so, once the firm had established itself among the leaders of the industry by the mid-century, conditions were such that competition was steadily reduced. Government regulation of the industry, especially through the excise tax, and the protection of patent law both played their part as barriers to the entry of new firms. Moreover, the manufacture of tobacco did not involve a range of complex technical problems. It is for this reason that the exclusive ownership of the Bonsack patent was such a powerful commercial weapon. Thus while it would be mistaken to describe leading members of the Wills family as heroic entrepreneurs in the Smilesian tradition, they proved their true worth when confronted with one of the most successful of the American &#145;robber barons&#146;. There is perhaps no better testimony to their business achievement.<br>
