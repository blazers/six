<span class="headword">Major,  Thomas</span>  (1720&#150;1799), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, may have been the infant baptized on 30 May 1720 at Preston Bisset, Buckinghamshire, the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Major, as Thomas later had property interests in that county. Claims that he was descended from Richard Major of Hursley, Hampshire, father-in-law of Richard Cromwell, are unsubstantiated. Major was taught to draw and etch by Hubert Gravelot, and his first prints are dated 1744. In October 1745 he accompanied the renowned landscape engraver Jacques-Philippe le Bas to Paris, assisted him there, and was befriended by the English-born engraver Andr&eacute; Laurent. He published several prints in Paris from his apartment in the rue St Jacques. In October 1746 Major was arrested and spent three months incarcerated in the Bastille as a reprisal for the temporary imprisonment of the Frenchmen of Fitz-James's horse and the Irish regiments after the battle of Culloden. He was freed after strenuous intercession with the marquis d'Argenson by le Bas, Gravelot, and the English banker Selwin. Major dedicated three prints to d'Argenson in grateful recognition of his help. When Laurent died in 1747 Major accompanied his body to its grave in Paris, but he had returned to England by December 1748 when he sold the dealer Arthur Pond a number of prints he had brought back to London. He continued to import prints, acting as an agent for le Bas, and in 1750 auctioned a collection of paintings that he had bought in Paris. Despite his activity as a dealer he published a number of prints in quick succession, including two after Teniers from the collection of the prince of Wales, which earned him an appointment as engraver to the prince. At about this time he married his wife, Dorothy; their first child, Elizabeth, was born in January 1752. In that year the family moved from the Golden Head in West Street to more spacious accommodation in Chandos Street, off lower St Martin's Lane, where a further fifteen children were born between 1752 and 1771.<br>
<br>Major was energetic in providing for his growing family. The patronage of the duke of Cumberland made it possible in 1753 to import Andr&eacute; Laurent's plates that Major had bought in Paris. Major completed and in 1753 published Laurent's unfinished <span class="italic">Death of the Stag</span>, after Wouverman. He engraved the views for two important architectural collections, the <span class="italic">Ruins of Palmyra</span> (1753) and the <span class="italic">Ruins of Baalbec</span> (1757). He issued a first broadsheet catalogue of his works in 1754, and in 1756 engraved a title-page for collections of his prints, claiming with some justification that they were &#145;A collection of prints engraved from the finest paintings of the greatest masters chosen out of the most celebrated collections in England and France&#146;. By then he was able to add to his other qualifications the title of engraver to the king, having been appointed chief seal engraver to the king with an annual income of &pound;50. He was ejected in 1760 but reinstated in 1768 after appealing on behalf of his many children, then reduced by infant mortality to eight. From 1756 until 1797 he was also engraver to the stamp office. His second printed catalogue of his publications listed sixty-four plates, supplemented in that year by <span class="italic">The Ruins of Paestum</span>, of which he was probably author as well as engraver and publisher. The text was translated into French in 1769 and into German in 1781.<br>
<br>Major joined the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1760, but showed prints with them only once, in 1762. He had nothing to do with the Society of Artists but was induced to become an original associate engraver of the Royal Academy in 1770. His most eminent colleagues had declined this honour as a slight to the profession (since they were denied full membership), and according to Robert Strange, Major was blackmailed with the loss of his pension. He exhibited there only once, in 1776, when he showed what may have been his last print, the <span class="italic">Good Shepherd</span>, after Murillo.<br>
<br>He did not altogether relinquish his craft, however. When in 1784 thieves stole the great seal from the house of Edward Thurlow, the lord chancellor, Major provided within twenty hours a perfect substitute, and afterwards one executed in silver, which was used until the union with Ireland. Specializing in the interpretation of Flemish paintings, Major was the first great English landscape engraver. He was overshadowed by younger rivals after the 1760s, but by then he had already compiled the basis of a comfortable fortune. He died at his house, 5 Tavistock Row, Westminster, on 30 December 1799 and was buried on 6 January 1800 at St Giles's, Camberwell, Surrey. He left his wife an estate valued at nearly &pound;5000, which included properties in Buckinghamshire.<br>
