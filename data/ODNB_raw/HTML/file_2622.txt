<span class="headword">Rishanger,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1249/50, <em>d.</em> after 1312), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and chronicler</span>, may have come from Rishangles in Suffolk. He became a monk of the abbey of St Albans, but the only certain biographical information about him comes from a memorandum transcribed in the lower margin of the first folio of his account of the barons' wars  (BL, Cotton MS Claudius D.vi, fol. 101<i>r</i>), which states that on the feast of the Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May) 1312 Rishanger had been a monk for forty-one years, and that he was then sixty-two years old. Modern scholars have assumed that the memorandum was written by Rishanger himself; in fact, the hand is an archaizing one which must date to considerably later in the fourteenth century or perhaps even the fifteenth. It is likely, however, that it represents an accurate copy of a genuine statement, rather than a forgery as such.<br>
<br>Rishanger names himself as author only in the <span class="italic">Quedam recapitulatio brevis de gestis domini Edwardi regis</span>, but in his <span class="italic">Index Britanniae scriptorum</span> John Bale assigned six works to him, not including the <span class="italic">Quedam recapitulatio</span>, giving incipits for each. In his <span class="italic">Scriptorum illustrium Maioris Brytanniae &hellip; catalogus</span> (1557, 1559) Bale added a seventh title, <span class="italic">Continuationes Matthaei Parisii</span>, and this latter chronicle (1259&#150;1307), which survives in one form or another in five manuscripts, was edited by H. T. Riley as an authentic work. It is, in fact, a transcription of Nicholas Trevet's <span class="italic">Annales</span>, supplemented by extracts from Rishanger's writings. It cannot be termed an independent history and it was almost certainly compiled after Rishanger's death, perhaps by Simon Binham or Richard Savage, both of whom were named as successors to Matthew Paris and Rishanger by Thomas Walsingham (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1422). Apart from Bale's list modern scholars have also tentatively assigned to Rishanger a continuation of Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> from 1255 to 1308, of which no contemporary copy survives, but from which Thomas Walsingham's surviving text derives.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> continuation aside, all the other authentic texts survive uniquely in two manuscripts, BL, Cotton MS Claudius D.vi, and the closely related first tract in BL, Royal MS 14 C.i. All were edited for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> by Riley, as were the works attributed to Trokelowe and Blaneforde, discussed below. Rishanger's account of the barons' wars had earlier also been edited by J. O. Halliwell for the Camden Society in 1840. Codicological evidence establishes that the manuscripts of Rishanger's works underwent a series of dismemberments and reorderings from the fourteenth right through to the early seventeenth century, and that the textual integrity of individual items is somewhat more questionable than might at first appear. Bale's evidence, moreover, reflects the status of a composite manuscript from which these two subsequent compilations derive. This manuscript, which Bale saw in the royal library, does not however represent the original codicological state of the texts. Indeed, Rishanger himself seems to have been responsible for a series of independent texts and chronicle fragments which were only later copied out, many on vellum with banded margins perhaps prepared much earlier for Matthew Paris. These were later still amalgamated into one roughly chronologically coherent compendium. The degree of certainty concerning Rishanger's authorship, moreover, varies from text to text and it is far from clear what he meant when he called himself <i>cronigraphus</i> and <i>cronicator</i>. He certainly did not have any kind of position as official historiographer at St Albans in the way that nineteenth-century historians assumed.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Quedam recapitulatio brevis de gestis domini Edwardi regis</span>, written after Edward I's death, gives a very brief account, &#145;de multis pauca tangendo&#146;, of the chief events of Edward's reign in the years between 1297 and 1307. As V. H. Galbraith pointed out, it is a panegyric rather than a set history. Now divided between Claudius D.vi and Royal 14 C.i as the result of a complex exchange between Sir Robert Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1631) and the royal librarian Patrick Young (<i>d</i>. 1652) some time in the early seventeenth century, it was originally the second item in an independent booklet, where it was prefaced by a copy of Edward I's letter of 1301 to Pope Boniface VIII (<i>r</i>. 1294&#150;1303) asserting England's overlordship of Scotland. Bale incorrectly attributed the latter to Rishanger under the title <span class="italic">De iure quod habet rex ad Scotiam</span>.<br>
<br>The account of the barons' wars (1264), listed by Bale under the title <span class="italic">Chronicon seu narratio de bellis apud Lewes et Evesham</span>, once formed a separate booklet and is prefaced with the rubric &#145;Incipiunt cronica fratris Willelmi de Rishanger&#146;. Much of this is a verbatim transcript of a now lost thirteenth-century continuation of Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> (1259&#150;65), the substance of which can be found copied into a manuscript of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>. Nevertheless, Rishanger does provide otherwise unattested details at various points in his narrative and some of his observations appear to derive from those who were actually close to Simon de Montfort himself. The account therefore has independent value as a primary source. By Bale's time Rishanger's autobiographical memorandum was found in the lower margin of the opening page of the account of the barons' wars. It would seem likely that this statement was recopied to this position from a discarded flyleaf when the booklet was integrated into a larger compilation. In the seventeenth century the memorandum was excised either by Young or by Cotton and was glued onto the first folio of Edward I's letter. Sir Frederic Madden restored it to its &#145;original&#146; place.<br>
<br>The internal evidence for Rishanger's authorship of the <span class="italic">Opus chronicorum</span>, which covers domestic events, foreign wars, and some local happenings for the years 1259 to 1296, and which was commissioned by the abbot John Maryns (1302&#150;8), is circumstantial and is based primarily on the fact that it provides a neat transition between Matthew Paris and Rishanger's <span class="italic">Quedam recapitulatio brevis</span>. Originally this text, with a short life of St Louis and a brief account of the death of Prince Alfonso (a son of Edward I, who was heir to the throne when he died in 1284 at the age of nine), presumably by the same author, formed an independent booklet. Another originally independent tract is the <span class="italic">Annales</span>, termed by Bale &#145;Super constituto rege Joanne Balliolo&#146;. The basis of this work, on the Great Cause to choose a king of Scots in 1291&#150;2, is a series of records compiled by the royal clerk John of Caen and deposited at St Albans; these were later reworked by an unskilled compiler, undoubtedly Rishanger himself. The <span class="italic">Annales</span> differ significantly from the official record contained in the so-called great rolls at a number of places, and on occasion provide more reliable information about the events surrounding the Great Cause. The <span class="italic">Annales</span> can, moreover, be linked thematically, although not codicologically, with a very short account of the Scottish controversy, termed by Bale in his entry for Rishanger &#145;De controversia habita super electione regni Scotie&#146;.<br>
<br>There are several other chronicle fragments in Claudius D.vi covering the years 1292&#150;1300 which are unnoticed by Bale, but which are printed by Riley under Rishanger's name. It is generally assumed that these materials, along with the other texts, were perhaps the rough drafts for a formal set of annals from 1259 to 1307 which Rishanger did not live to complete. In general, Rishanger's chief value to the modern historian lies in the information he provides, and not in his analysis of it. St Albans was a major monastery with a wide circle of influential connections, and Rishanger may have had access to oral and written records which have since been lost. Even though many of his writings are in a fragmentary state and lack continuity, they must be treated as potentially important primary sources in cases where they differ from other accounts.<br>
<br>In his list of Rishanger's writings Bale also included annals of the reign of Edward II, attributed to <a name="cosubject_27746"></a><span class="headword">John  de Trokelowe</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1330)<span class="occ"></span>, composed about 1330 or later. This text (covering the years 1307&#150;23 and ending with the execution of Andrew Harclay, earl of Carlisle) continues to folio 212<i>r</i> of Claudius D.vi and is terminated by the colophon &#145;Hucusque scripsit frater Iohannes de Trokelowe&#146;. Trokelowe may possibly be identified with a monk at Tynemouth, who was part of a conspiracy in 1294 to make the priory independent of St Albans. There are complications in the attribution of these <span class="italic">Annales</span> to Trokelowe, however, since Thomas Walsingham, writing about 1400, gave Rishanger as the source for his account of the executions that followed the battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, and this episode is in fact contained in Trokelowe's annals. Nor did Walsingham mention Trokelowe in his list of St Albans historians: &#145;Post Matthaeum, Willelmus Risangre, Henricus Blankfrount, Symon Bynham, et Ricardus Savage, Chronica successive scripserunt&#146;  (Walsingham, <span class="italic">Annales</span>, 2.303). It is possible, then, that Trokelowe was only the scribe rather than the author as such, and that this text is substantially the work of Rishanger. Trokelowe's chronicle is pro-baronial and is relatively sympathetic to Edward II. The importance of St Albans as a centre for information and locus of public events, moreover, gives Trokelowe access to significant amounts of firsthand information not otherwise available.<br>
<br>In Claudius D.vi the <span class="italic">Annales</span> are followed by a new heading &#145;Incipiunt chronica fratris Henrici de Blaneforde&#146; introducing a text that ends incomplete in 1324 as a result of loss of leaves. It has been speculated that this continuation of Trokelowe's <span class="italic">Annales</span> by <a name="cosubject_2622"></a><span class="headword">Henry Blaneforde</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1324)<span class="occ"></span> originally continued up to 1328 and that Walsingham's &#145;short chronicle&#146; thus took up more or less where it left off. John Stow, who took notes from Claudius D.vi, referred to an entry for Blaneforde under 1326, but the entry in fact relates to the trial of Adam Orleton, bishop of Hereford, which took place in 1323.<br>
