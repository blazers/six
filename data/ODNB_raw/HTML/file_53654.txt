<span class="headword">Marston,  Edward</span>  (1825&#150;1914), <span class="occ">publisher, writer, and angler</span>, was born on 14 February 1825 in Lydbury, Shropshire, the son of Richard Marston (1791&#150;1875), a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bright (1793&#150;1845). Three years later the family relocated to Montgomeryshire, and two years after that to a farm in Lucton, Herefordshire. Marston attended the Lucton School from 1832 to 1840, and then was apprenticed to a bookseller from 1840 to 1844 in a nearby town. His wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pratt (<i>d</i>. 1888), whom he married on 9 August 1851, was from the area.<br>
<br>Marston is a significant figure because, more than most Victorian publishers, he was steeped in the international market for print. His first job was with the Liverpool firm of Willmer and Smith, publishers of the <span class="italic">European Mail</span> and exporters of newspapers and magazines. In 1846 he went to London to work for Sampson Low, who had a bookshop, circulating library, and reading-room in Lamb's Conduit Street. Low also owned and edited the <span class="italic">Publishers' Circular</span>, a trade weekly: Marston was assigned to collect titles of newly published books from local publishers and Stationers' Hall, and later he would make the rounds of booksellers throughout the United Kingdom. He would eventually become chairman of Publishers' Circular Ltd.<br>
<br>In 1852 Marston left Sampson Low to set up an Australian import&#150;export business in Fenchurch Street. Shipping books to Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide proved to be a profitable sideline which blossomed into a major business. Fifty-two years later he estimated that he had sent at least 20,000 letters to overseas correspondents and dealt with as many as 10,000 authors. Since Sampson Low and his son, Sampson Low jun., had developed a similar trade with the United States, Marston became their partner on 1 January 1856. Samuel Warren Searle joined the partnership in 1872, followed by William John Rivington and, in 1883, Marston's son Robert (<i>b</i>. 1853). Sampson Low retired in 1875.<br>
<br>Initially based at 47 Ludgate Hill, the firm of Sampson Low, Son, and Marston became notable for its global reach. It would specialize in books about Africa, Australasia, the American west, Canada, the Arctic, and Asia. In 1875 Marston was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Of all his authors he corresponded most with the explorer Henry Morton Stanley: Marston met him in Egypt to bring home part of the manuscript of Stanley's <span class="italic">In Darkest Africa</span>.<br>
<br>Marston visited the United States twice. A vacation in the Rocky Mountains resulted in the popular travelogue <span class="italic">Frank's Ranche</span> (1886). His company had a substantial list of American writers, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. Marston also travelled to Paris in order to secure the rights to Victor Hugo and other French authors. His firm published at least fifty-five works by Jules Verne, starting with <span class="italic">Twenty-Thousand Leagues under the Sea</span> (1871). Marston also served as secretary of the Relief Fund for Paris Booksellers, a committee of publishers and booksellers which shipped food aid to the besieged city during the Franco-Prussian War. With his worldwide contacts he became an expert on international law governing intellectual property, publishing numerous journalistic articles on the subject as well as a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Copyright, National and International, from the Point of View of a Publisher</span> (1879; new and enlarged edn, 1887).<br>
<br>Marston also worked with many British authors, among them Charles Reade and G. A. Henty. Thomas Hardy published with him, though he felt that he needed a more adventurous house for <span class="italic">Tess of the d'Urbervilles</span>. A grateful R. D. Blackmore thanked Marston for his support: &#145;But for you&#146;, he wrote, &#145;<span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> might never have seen the light&#146;  (Marston, 135). Another of his authors, W. Clark Russell, remembered him with equal fondness: &#145;I was struck by his good looks, his soft, dark intelligent eyes, his agreeable manner, and a pleasant reserve which as I afterwards came to know, easily thawed when you gained his acquaintanceship or friendship&#146;  (ibid., 144).<br>
<br>Marston had been fond of fishing as a boy but gave it up for nearly forty years of urban life. Only in the early 1880s did he return to his old hobby. Then, starting with <span class="italic">An Amateur Angler's Days in Dove Dale</span> (1884), he acquired some fame as the author of several light volumes on angling, all paying homage to Isaak Walton.<br>
<br>Edward Marston retired from publishing in 1903 and died at Coombeheigh, The Downs, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 6 April 1914. He had been a devout though tolerant member of the Church of England. His memoir <span class="italic">After Work</span> (1904) and his writings on copyright have some value for historians of the book trade. His <span class="italic">Sketches of Booksellers of other Days</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Sketches of some Booksellers of the Time of Dr. Samuel Johnson</span> (1902) represented early attempts to popularize the history of books.<br>
