<span class="headword">Mills,  James Philip</span>  (1890&#150;1960), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born on 18 February 1890 at Oak Lea, Norbury Moor, Norbury, Cheshire, the younger son of James Edward Mills, hat manufacturer and later owner of Mills steelworks and Bredbury Hall, near Stockport, and his wife, Ada Smith, who was fatally injured in a carriage accident and died the day after giving birth to her son. He was educated at Winchester College (1903&#150;8) and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1909&#150;12), and entered the Indian Civil Service in 1913. He served as a trooper in the Jumna valley light horse throughout the First World War. By 1916, however, he was working in the Naga hills in Assam, where he later became deputy commissioner. Inspired by his colleague John Henry Hutton, by his friendship with the curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, Henry Balfour, and by the practical necessity of advising and arbitrating issues on the borders of the British empire, he soon became interested in anthropology.<br>
<br>During his numerous trips through administered and unadministered areas of the Naga hills, Mills was in a unique position to examine a vanishing world, full of extraordinary beauty and violence, among forest-dwelling groups of enormous diversity. The first of his classic monographs, <span class="italic">The Lhota Nagas</span>, was published in 1922, and was followed by <span class="italic">The Ao Nagas</span> in 1926. In 1926 he advised the government on the administration of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. He became acting deputy commissioner of Cachar (1927&#150;8), and was made honorary director of ethnography for Assam in 1930, when he returned to the Naga hills and worked on his monograph <span class="italic">The Rengma Nagas</span> (1937). On 2 November 1930 he married Pamela Moira (1903&#150;1992), daughter of John Foster-Vesey-Fitzgerald, of Moyrhea, co. Clare. They had three daughters, one of whom died at the age of fifteen. He became secretary to the government of Assam in 1932. He was made CIE (1941) and CSI (1947), and in 1942 was awarded the Rivers medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1943 he was appointed adviser to the governor of Assam for tribal areas and states. He was in Assam during the Second World War, an area engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the war. He retired from India in 1947 and became a lecturer (1948) and then a reader (1950) in anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He was president of the Royal Anthropological Institute from 1951 to 1953. In 1954 he retired to Dorset, where he spent time on the gardening and fishing which had always been his hobbies. He died at his home, East House, Sydling St Nicholas, near Dorchester, on 12 May 1960, and was cremated in Weymouth.<br>
<br>Mills's closest associate in Assam, J. H. Hutton, wrote of him: &#145;Mills made an admirable colleague in administration. Apart from his practical and intellectual ability, his never failing sense of humour, his wit and his good temper in trying circumstances made him an invaluable companion&#146;  (Hutton). His three great Naga monographs are superb examples of ethnographic writing: clear, learned, a mine of facts and interpretations. Along with his numerous articles, they constitute over 2000 pages of careful documentation of the various groups living on the borders of India and Burma. They remain an invaluable source. They are supplemented by the valuable collections of Naga objects which he gave to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which, with those given by Hutton, make this perhaps the widest and deepest collection of objects on any particular people in any anthropology museum in Britain. Mills, like Hutton, was a keen amateur photographer; several hundred photographs (now at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London), which complement the collections of Hutton, Christoph von F&uuml;rer-Haimendorf (whom he helped and inspired), Ursula Graham Bower, and W. G. Archer, again provide invaluable documentation of the first encounters with the Nagas.<br>
