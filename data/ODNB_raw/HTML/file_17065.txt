</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lovell, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1449&#150;1524), <span class="occ">administrator and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son of Ralph Lovell of Beachamwell, a cadet of the Lovells of Barton Bendish, a minor family of Norfolk gentry. Like many men of his station, he sought his fortune through study of the law. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1464, when he was perhaps about fifteen, was treasurer there from 1472 to 1475, and rose to be reader in autumn 1475 and Lent 1482, meanwhile developing a practice among East Anglian clients and finding a seat on the Norfolk commission of the peace. He joined the revolt of 1483 against Richard III, probably as a follower of Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset, and was attainted in the following year's parliament. His resultant attachment to the cause of Henry Tudor, though it cannot be shown to have led to his fighting for Tudor at Bosworth, was the key to his subsequent career. In 1485 he served as speaker of the Commons in Henry's first parliament. In the years that followed he became an established member of the inner ring of less than a dozen councillors most influential with the king.<br>
<br>Lovell's primary responsibilities were financial. He was treasurer of the king's chamber from 1485, an increasingly important office as Henry gradually restored the chamber to the supremacy it had enjoyed in Yorkist financial administration but lost for some years after Bosworth. From 12 October 1485 he was also chancellor of the exchequer, smoothing relations between the older financial institutions and the new. By 1503, when much of his work in the chamber seems to have been taken over by his former clerk John Heron, he became treasurer of the king's household. These offices were combined with more flexible but no less important roles. He regularly travelled to Calais to collect the king's French pension, audited accounts with the king and other councillors, and took bonds for payment from many victims of the king's exactions.<br>
<br>Lovell also worked to ensure Henry's security on the throne. As deputy lieutenant and later, from Michaelmas 1512, lieutenant of the Tower of London, he took custody of many state prisoners. By the end of his life he was keeping Lambert Simnel, pretender to the throne in 1487, as a falconer in his household. In a task of similarly sensitive implications, he and Sir Reynold Bray arranged for the construction of Richard III's tomb. He fought at Stoke in 1487, where he was knighted, in France in 1492, and at Blackheath in 1497, where he was made banneret. In 1500 his loyalty was rewarded with election to the Order of the Garter. His relationships with other leading councillors were close, in particular, it would seem, those with Richard Fox, bishop successively of Exeter, Durham, and Winchester, with Giles, Lord Daubeney, and with John de Vere, thirteenth earl of Oxford. Their co-operation was an important key to the stability of Henry's regime.<br>
<br>Henry's councillors took their judicial function very seriously, and Lovell was no exception. Statistics based on the thin surviving records make him the second most regular attender of the reign in the Star Chamber, and one of the most regular in the judicial sessions of the council attendant. He was frequently involved in the arbitration of suits and attended occasional sessions of the commission of the peace in half a dozen counties. As steward of the universities of Oxford from 1507 and Cambridge from 1509 he oversaw the exercise of their privileged jurisdictions. As steward of the manorial courts of many crown and church estates, he administered through his deputies justice at the most local level.<br>
<br>Such stewardships were also the foundation of Lovell's considerable military power. In 1492 he raised 143 men for the king; in 1497 it was 493. By 1508, when he listed the followers he had been allowed to retain under royal licence, they numbered 1365, more than half drawn from estates on which he was steward, including significant boroughs such as Derby, Lichfield, and Nottingham. These retainers were often the leading men in their communities: seven past and future mayors of Walsall, seven churchwardens of Thame, seven of the nine richest men in Hitchin. Lovell acted as their patron at the centre of power and reaped his reward not only in service but also in gratitude. In 1507, after he had helped secure a new borough charter, the town council of Wallingford ordered that he be prayed for in each of the town's parish churches every Sunday for the rest of his life. Thus he helped to tie the &eacute;lites of towns and villages to the developing Tudor regime.<br>
<br>Lovell made considerable profits in Henry's service. His fees for offices and the pensions paid to him by those who valued his influence with the king enabled him to spend freely on the land market, until by 1522&#150;3 he enjoyed a clear landed income of over &pound;450 a year, from estates spread across twelve counties from Yorkshire to Kent and from Wiltshire to Norfolk. Between 1486 and 1513 perhaps double this sum accrued to him annually from the estates of his brother-in-law, Edmund, Lord Ros. In 1485 or 1486, doubtless with the king's backing, he had married Isabel (1451&#150;1508/9), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50226/', "Thomas, Lord Ros")</script>, and widow of Sir Thomas Everingham (<i>d</i>. 1484/5). She brought him not only a share in the Tiptoft inheritance derived from her mother, but also, under the terms of a deal struck with the king in 1486, the keeping of her brother's lands, he being adjudged mentally incapable of managing them. Lovell extended the lands under his control yet further by leases from the crown, religious houses, university colleges, and noblemen. Some of his profits he put into building: a brick house with battlemented gatehouse and polygonal turrets at East Harling, Norfolk, a London house next to Holywell Nunnery in Shoreditch, and a brick palace sufficient to receive the court on progress at Elsings in Enfield. He also made generous contributions to other building projects: the clerestory and glazing of Enfield parish church, the windows of Malvern Priory (where the remains of his likeness survive), the gatehouse of Lincoln's Inn, the walls of Gonville Hall, Cambridge, and the repair of Dover harbour. He made large donations to Holywell Nunnery, where he built himself a burial chapel inscribed:<blockquote>
<div>All the nunnes in Holywel<br>
</div>
<div>Pray for the soul of Sir Thomas Lovel.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Enough remained to sustain a splendid style of life, with eighty-five liveried servants, expensive tapestries on the wall, and scores of printed books. For the subsidy of 1524 he was taxed on goods worth &pound;2000. Little of this grandeur survives except for his portrait, executed in a bronze medallion attributed to Pietro Torrigiano, now at Westminster Abbey. His interests seem to have been wide: he often made use of his ecclesiastical patronage to support clerics who were continuing their education, and at the end of his life he made efforts to meet the explorer Sebastian Cabot.<br>
<br>At the accession of Henry VIII, Lovell remained a leading member of the king's council. He continued to sit regularly in Star Chamber, helped untangle the complex financial legacy of the previous reign, and became involved in new ventures such as the campaigns against enclosure in 1517 and vagrancy in 1519. On 6 February 1510 he became chief justice of the royal forests south of Trent and from 14 June 1513 he served as master of the wards, improving the local administration of what would later become the court of wards. In the wars of 1511&#150;14 he supervised the procurement of artillery and the fortification of Calais. Advancing age reduced his activity and he gave up some of his offices: the treasurership of the household in 1519, the mastership of the wards in 1520. Yet he remained a trusted councillor, taking part in the interrogation of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, in 1520. At length, after a year or more of illness, he died on 25 May 1524 at his house at Elsings in Enfield. After a sumptuous funeral he was buried in his chapel at Holywell Nunnery on 8 June. Having no children, he had made arrangements for the advancement of the children of his brother Sir Robert and of his cousin Sir Gregory. His niece Ursula he had married to William Hussey, son of his colleague Sir John, at a cost of &pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.; her sister Elizabeth he had matched with his great-nephew Thomas Manners, heir to the Ros estates and later first earl of Rutland. The bulk of his estates he left to Francis, second son of Sir Gregory, who founded the Norfolk gentry family of Lovell of East Harling.<br>
