<span class="headword">Darwin,  William Erasmus</span>  (1839&#150;1914), <span class="occ">subject of a study in child psychology</span>, was born on 27 December 1839 at 12 Upper Gower Street, London, and baptized at St Peter's Church, Maer, Staffordshire, on 23 June 1840. He was the first of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7176/', "Charles Robert Darwin (1809&#150;1882)")</script>, naturalist, geologist, and originator of the theory of natural selection, and Emma (1808&#150;1896), daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer, Staffordshire. William's siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93082/', "Anne Elizabeth (Annie) Darwin (1841&#150;1851)")</script>, Henrietta Emma 
    (later Henrietta Litchfield; 1843&#150;1927)
  , <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32718/', "George Howard Darwin (1845&#150;1912)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32717/', "Francis Darwin (1848&#150;1925)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54078/', "Leonard Darwin (1850&#150;1943)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32719/', "Horace Darwin (1851&#150;1928)")</script>. During the first three years of William's life, Charles Darwin kept a daily record of his son's actions, gestures, and expressions, in order to identify the stages by which the human infant develops its human capacities alongside innate animal abilities. Darwin had recognized the importance of the link between animals and humans at an early stage in his thinking about evolution. He had studied the behaviour of a young orang-utan at London Zoo in 1838 and had made private notes for a &#145;natural history of babies&#146; to test his emerging ideas  (<span class="italic">Charles Darwin's Notebooks</span>, 560).<br>
<br>Darwin started his observations as soon as William was born: &#145;During first week. Yawned, stretched himself just like old person&#151;chiefly upper extremities&#151;hiccuped&#151;sneezes sucked.&#146; On the ninth day William appeared to follow a candle with his eyes. When he was a month and a day old, he recognized his mother's bosom from three or four inches away, and at six weeks and three days he smiled at his mother, &#145;not only with his lips, but eyes&#146;. Darwin had a particular interest in his son's expressions and gestures of emotion and the feelings that might lie behind them, noting in the eleventh week that William's cries had become &#145;various&#146;; &#145;the hunger cry is different from that of pain&#146;. Darwin compared William's behaviour to the orang-utan, as well as to puppies, nestling birds, a new-born crocodile, young mice, and colts in South America. He observed William's first signs of anger and affection, fear and pleasure. In the seventeenth week Darwin detected hints of possible reasoning, and noticed William's first &#145;association of ideas&#146;: &#145;He understands when his cloak is on, he is to go out &amp; is cross if not taken immediately.&#146; Darwin was fascinated to see how quickly the child appeared to grasp the difference between a real person and his picture or reflection in a mirror, between real actions and play, and between natural objects and human imitations of them. Darwin watched carefully for any signs of the emergence of a moral sense and observed William's first display of a &#145;kind of conscience&#146; at two-and-a-half years, in a piece of &#145;natural acting and deceit&#146; to hide a pickle he had stolen from a jar in the dining room.<br>
<br>The study confirmed Darwin's belief in the close continuity between animal and human nature, and was almost certainly in his mind when he made his single comment in the <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span> (1859) about the implications of his theory for humans: &#145;Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.&#146; Darwin included many of his observations of William's infant anger and pleasure in <span class="italic">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</span> (1872), and published his findings on William's psychological development in the journal <span class="italic">Mind</span> under the title &#145;A biographical sketch of an infant&#146; (no. 7, July 1877). The account also included observations on William's younger sister, Annie, whom Darwin had observed alongside her elder brother.<br>
<br>William was later educated at Rugby School, and at Christ's College, Cambridge; he became a partner in Grant and Maddison's Union Banking Company of Southampton. On 29 November 1877 he married Sara Price Ashburner Sedgwick (1839&#150;1902), daughter of Theodore Sedgwick of New York, at Trinity Church, Paddington, London. They lived in Bassett, Southampton. William's one action of public consequence in an otherwise uneventful adult life was to champion the cause of university education for all, and to play a leading role in the initiatives which led to the foundation of a university college in Southampton in 1902. After his wife's death he spent much time with his nieces <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35685/', "Gwen Raverat")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32570/', "Frances Cornford")</script>, and Margaret Keynes, and his modest eccentricities as an old man were celebrated by Raverat in her memoir of her childhood, <span class="italic">Period Piece</span> (1952). William Darwin died on 8 September 1914 at Baliol School, Sedbergh, Cumbria, and was buried in St Nicolas's Church, North Stoneham.<br>
<br>Charles Darwin's &#145;Biographical sketch of an infant&#146; was the first fully scientific study of psychological development from birth to early childhood. It showed the value of a strictly observational and chronological approach and prompted the German psychologist William Preyer to study his own son in the same way and to publish his findings in <span class="italic">Die Seele des Kindes</span> (1882; translated as <span class="italic">The Mind of the Child</span>, 1888). Child psychology developed rapidly on these naturalistic and empirical foundations. The American psychologist James Mark Baldwin based his <span class="italic">Mental Development in the Child and the Race</span> (1895) on a similar study of his two daughters, and acknowledged Darwin's and Preyer's example in his <span class="italic">History of Psychology</span> (1913).<br>
