<span class="headword">Gershevitch,  Ilya</span>  (1914&#150;2001), <span class="occ">scholar of Iranian languages</span>, was born Ilja Gerschewitsch on 24 October 1914 in Z&uuml;rich, the only child of Aron (Arkadi) Gerschewitsch (1891&#150;<i>c</i>.1926), a medical student, and his wife, (Rose) Mila Mirov (1889&#150;1975), a pianist. Stranded in Germany on the outbreak of war in 1914, his Russian parents had fled to Switzerland, where they lived in straitened circumstances. His father became too ill to finish his medical studies and died from tuberculosis when Ilja was still a child; his mother supported the family by teaching the piano and playing for dances. As a schoolboy in Locarno and Lugano, Gerschewitsch learned to play the piano and cello and at one time seemed destined for a musical career. Nevertheless in 1933 he enrolled as a student of classics at the University of Rome, where he received his introduction to Indo-European comparative philology and obtained the degree of <i>dottore in lettere</i> in 1937. He was baptized a Roman Catholic at St Peter's Basilica, Rome, on 29 March 1934, though in later life he ceased to regard himself as a member of the church.<br>
<br>In 1938 Gerschewitsch came to England on what was intended to be a short visit, but, as he later recalled, he soon decided that England was the most civilized country he had seen and the one in which he would like to spend the rest of his life. Abandoning his possessions in Rome, and now spelling his name Ilya Gershevitch, he enrolled at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London as a student of W. B. Henning, a charismatic teacher whom he revered both as a man and as a scholar. Under Henning's guidance he turned his attention to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family of languages, obtaining his second doctorate in 1943 from the University of London with a thesis on Sogdian, the language of pre-Islamic Samarkand.<br>
<br>In 1947 Gershevitch became a British citizen. In 1948 he was appointed to a new lectureship in Iranian studies at Cambridge and in 1962 was elected a fellow of Jesus College. In 1965 he was promoted to reader. Once settled in Cambridge, he found university and especially college life so congenial that he never left, despite tempting offers from the United States, where he spent a couple of years as a visiting professor during the 1960s. On 29 June 1951 he married Elisabeth Marie (Lisbeth) Syfrig (<i>b</i>. 1925), a Swiss nurse, daughter of Josef Syfrig of Lucerne. They had one daughter, adopted in 1958.<br>
<br>The 1950s were a busy and productive decade for Gershevitch. His <span class="italic">Grammar of Manichean Sogdian</span> and <span class="italic">The Avestan Hymn to Mithra</span>&#151;two books which transformed the study of the languages concerned&#151;appeared in 1954 and 1959 respectively. In 1956 he and his wife undertook a journey to southern Iran to record the unknown dialects of Bashkardia, a region which scarcely any European had previously penetrated and which, as they subsequently discovered, was reputed to be &#145;the most ill-famed of the Shah's dominion on account of the hostility of its inhabitants&#146;  (Gershevitch, 213). Unfortunately the Bashkardi grammar on which Gershevitch laboured for many years was never completed, nor did he publish the Ratanbai Katrak lectures which he gave at Oxford in 1968. In fact he never wrote another book, but presented his many original ideas and discoveries in the form of articles. Some of these were collected in his <span class="italic">Philologia Iranica</span> of 1985, which included a bibliography of his publications up to that date. Often witty, and occasionally whimsical, these articles were simultaneously dense and wide-ranging; they covered a remarkable variety of topics within Iranian studies, including Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and Achaemenian history, as well as a large number of languages: Old Persian and Elamite, Sogdian and Bactrian, Persian and Ossetic, among others.<br>
<br>On his appointment at Cambridge, Gershevitch drew up a syllabus covering seven Iranian languages and then set about mastering each of them himself. He demanded equal dedication from his students, throwing them in at the deep end and taking it for granted that they would pick up for themselves whatever languages might be required for reading the secondary literature. Although he almost always wrote in English, he spoke many European languages fluently; his Italian was particularly admired. Russian was of course his mother tongue, though he did not visit Russia until 1960. In due course he received honours from many countries: he became a fellow of the British Academy in 1967 and later a corresponding member of the Danish Academy (1982), the Accademia dei Lincei (1987), and the Russian Academy (1992). In 1971 he received an honorary doctorate from Bern, and endeared himself to his audience by his fluency in Schwyzerd&uuml;tsch (Swiss German).<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1982, at a time of cuts in university funding, Gershevitch's post was abolished, despite rigorous lobbying in which he played a full part. In retirement he continued his scholarly work, though he was severely hampered by failing eyesight during his last years. He died of heart failure at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 11 April 2001; his body was cremated at Cambridge on 20 April. He was survived by his wife, Lisbeth, and their daughter. In accordance with Gershevitch's wishes, his library was presented to the newly founded department of Iranian studies in Ravenna. His Bashkardi notes and recordings were deposited at the Ancient India and Iran Trust in Cambridge.<br>
