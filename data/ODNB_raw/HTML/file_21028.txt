<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Owen,  Robert Dale</span>  (1801&#150;1877), <span class="occ">social reformer and emancipationist</span>, was born at Glasgow on 7 November 1801, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21027/', "Robert Owen (1771&#150;1858)")</script>, entrepreneur and social reformer, and his wife, Ann Caroline (1779&#150;1831), daughter of David Dale, a successful Glasgow merchant and philanthropist who in 1785 built the cotton-spinning community of New Lanark. It was acquired by an English partnership and managed from 1800 by Owen's father, who subsequently used it to test his social and economic ideas. Although Owen became a prominent American citizen and spent most of his life there he also followed in his father's footsteps, making an important contribution to social and educational reform in both Britain and the United States. His earliest memories were of his grandfather's funeral (1806) and being led round New Lanark mills by his father, who explained to him the importance of order, thrift, and sobriety among the workers. Like the rest of the family he was initially educated privately, being taught French by an officer prisoner of war billeted in nearby Lanark. In his early teens he had a serious illness, but after recovery accompanied his father on a tour of factories gathering evidence for a parliamentary select committee on the employment of children (1816).<br>
<br>Owen's father was by that time rich and successful, able to afford the lifestyle of a Scottish laird and pursue an expensive propaganda campaign designed to advance the ideas he had articulated in <span class="italic">A New View of Society</span> (1813&#150;16). Owen was seen by his father as his successor in his plans to reform society, and was educated accordingly. In 1818, having learned German, Owen and his brother William went to Switzerland to a school at Hofwyl, near Bern, run by Phillip Emanuel von Fellenberg. Fellenberg's educational theories had been partly influenced by Pestalozzi, whose ideas were becoming known in Britain. Indeed Owen's father modified them for use in the school at New Lanark. The curriculum in Fellenberg's school aimed to inculcate philanthropic and humanitarian values in its &eacute;lite students and at the same time expose them to the agricultural labour those attending a parallel school for the poor were expected to undertake. As with Pestalozzi, environmental and social awareness figured prominently in the curriculum. Owen and his brother responded positively, looked upon Fellenberg as a father figure, and corresponded with him for years after.<br>
<br>On his return to Scotland in 1821 Owen found his father prospering in business, but as a radical reformer having lost much ground. Owen then became a teacher in the schools and institute at New Lanark, publishing in 1824 a detailed account of the facilities and curricula, emphasizing the work of the pioneering infant school (called the &#145;baby school&#146; by American visitors) and the teaching of subjects such as history, geography, environmental studies, music, and dancing. While his father was in the United States during 1824&#150;5, Owen deputized as manager of the mills. During 1825 he went to the Netherlands, where he pursued his interest in social reform by visiting Frederiksoord, Veenhuizen, and other agricultural communities for the poor resembling those proposed by his father in 1817.<br>
<br>In 1825 Owen left for New Harmony, Indiana, a village his father had purchased after temporarily abandoning his community experiments in Britain. Owen accompanied his father on a propaganda tour of the eastern United States before sailing down the Ohio from Pittsburgh to Mount Vernon on a keel-boat nicknamed the Boatload of Knowledge. Its passengers included the scientists William Maclure, Thomas Say, and Charles Alexandre Lesueur, the teachers Marie Fretageot and William Phiquepal d'Arusmont, and other notables going to join the community in Indiana. Owen's diary records his experiences on the journey, noting (in German) an increasing scepticism about his father's views. On arriving at New Harmony he became one of the &eacute;lite group which drew up a series of constitutions, rules, and regulations for the community, but within a short time it was in disarray. While the equality his father wanted was gradually abandoned Owen, physically unfit for the manual work for which he had volunteered, threw himself into teaching, and from September 1826 edited the <span class="italic">New Harmony Gazette</span>. The periodical soon reflected his thought on social reform issues.<br>
<br>When the community collapsed Owen had to decide what to do next. Rejecting his father as mentor, he went his own way. He became a trustee of Nashoba, a farming community Frances Wright, the reformer, had started near Memphis, Tennessee, to educate and emancipate slaves. He joined her in May 1827, but when she became ill accompanied her in June that year to Europe. After visiting France he returned to Scotland, hoping to marry his childhood sweetheart, a spinner at New Lanark, but later claimed that his mother prevented him doing so. During this visit he renewed his acquaintance with Jeremy Bentham, one of his father's partners, and met William Godwin, who had greatly influenced his father's thinking, Henry Leigh Hunt, and Godwin's daughter, Mary Shelley, whom he found attractive physically and intellectually.<br>
<br>Back in the United States, Owen continued his editing at New Harmony and co-operated with Frances Wright and others promoting liberal views on religion, divorce law, popular education, and greater equality of wealth. He moved to New York in June 1829, where for several years, periodically assisted by Wright, he edited the <span class="italic">Free Enquirer</span>, successor to the <span class="italic">New Harmony Gazette</span>. In New York he became one of the leaders of the movement for public education, which achieved some success during 1829&#150;30. The <span class="italic">Free Enquirer</span> campaigned vigorously on behalf of the Working Men's Party, which was active on educational issues. Any thought that he might marry Frances Wright was dashed when in 1831 she revealed a liaison with Phiquepal d'Arusmont. Owen then married Mary Jane Robinson, daughter of a supporter of the Working Men's Party, on 12 April 1832. Accompanied by his bride Owen returned to Britain to assist his father in his propaganda, and from November helped edit <span class="italic">Crisis</span>, the organ of Owenism. The movement rejected political action in favour of social reform. Owen felt this was out of step with the mood of the times and, becoming even more disillusioned with his father's approach, returned to New Harmony in April 1833 after only six months as joint editor. His younger brothers, David and Richard, had also emigrated to the United States and became successful geologists.<br>
<br>Owen played an active part in maintaining and developing New Harmony's reputation as a centre of educational and social reform. He pursued these aims as a democratic member of the Indiana legislature (1836&#150;8) and as a member of the United States Congress (1843&#150;7). In 1844 he helped solve the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain and in 1845 saw through the bill that set up the Smithsonian Institution. He subsequently had a distinguished role in its design and development as a centre of research and education. His diplomatic career began in 1853 when President Franklin Pierce appointed him charg&eacute; d'affaires in Naples, making him minister in 1855. Possibly this was to remove him, for Pierce, a prominent pro-slaver, must have been aware that Owen was an emancipationist. While in Italy, Owen came to Britain on several occasions to visit his then ailing father. He was present at his death and funeral at Newtown, Montgomeryshire, in 1858.<br>
<br>On his return to the United States, Owen became an active emancipationist, publishing a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Policy of Emancipation</span> (1863), which greatly influenced Lincoln, and a more detailed study, <span class="italic">The Wrong of Slavery</span> (1864). However, his views did not extend to immediate suffrage as he thought former slaves should not be given the vote until a decade had elapsed. He held liberal views on divorce law, on which he published pamphlets, he wrote about birth control (to which his father often alluded, though never directly), and from his stay in Italy was interested in spiritualism (to which his father had also been attracted). He published a series of autobiographical essays covering his early life in a book, <span class="italic">Threading my Way</span> (1874). His first wife died in 1871 and he married secondly Lottie Walton Kellogg on 23 June 1876. Following a period of mental derangement Owen died at his summer home on Lake George, New York, on 24 June 1877. Although Owen's major contributions to social reform (overshadowed to some degree by his notoriety as an exponent of liberal divorce laws and birth control) occurred in the United States, his description of the schools at New Lanark earned him a reputation as an educational pioneer in Britain.<br>
