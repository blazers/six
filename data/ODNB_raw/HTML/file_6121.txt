<span class="headword">Conway,  Francis  Seymour-</span>, first marquess of Hertford  (1718&#150;1794), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born on 5 July 1718 in Lindsey House, Chelsea, Middlesex, the son and heir of Francis Seymour-Conway, first Baron Conway of Ragley (1679&#150;1732), politician, and his third wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1734), the daughter of John and Elizabeth Shorter of Bybrook, Kent. His mother was the granddaughter of Sir John Shorter, lord mayor of London, and the sister of Catherine Shorter, the first wife of Sir Robert Walpole. From 1732 he attended Eton College, and in the same year he succeeded his father as second Baron Conway. On 29 May 1741 he married Isabella (1726&#150;1782), the fourth and youngest daughter of Charles Fitzroy, second duke of Grafton, and his wife, Henrietta Somerset. They had seven sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25175/', "Lord Hugh Seymour")</script>, naval officer, and six daughters. On 3 August 1750 he was created Viscount Beauchamp and earl of Hertford, titles recently extinct by the death of Algernon Seymour, seventh duke of Somerset. Described by his cousin Horace Walpole as &#145;a perfect courtier&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.269), Hertford held a succession of posts. He became a lord of the bedchamber and KG in 1757 and was sworn of the privy council in 1763. He served as ambassador to France in 1763&#150;5, lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1765&#150;6, and lord chamberlain from 1766 to 1782 and again from April to December 1783. He was also lord lieutenant of Warwickshire from 1757 until his death.<br>
<br>Hertford was the head of a sizeable family interest. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6122/', "Henry Seymour Conway (1719&#150;1795)")</script>, army officer and politician, was a political and military figure of importance, and his six sons were all members of parliament. He exerted control over the parliamentary borough of Orford from the 1760s and also influenced elections in Coventry. His ability to provide for himself and his family was the object of envy. The earl of Bristol once described him as &#145;an excellent sollicitor, [who] has a constant appetite for all preferments for himself and family, with the quickest digestion and the shortest memory of past favours of any of the present noblemen of this modest and reasonable age&#146;  (Brooke, 71).<br>
<br>Hertford was at the peak of his importance from 1766 to 1782, when he was at the centre of court life as lord chamberlain and acted as friend and confidant to George III. With the king's blessing, he was active in negotiations in 1767 that sought to strengthen the Chatham administration. At one point he was mentioned as a possible first minister. Although he was tempted by the prospect of a promotion in the peerage (a personal ambition), he declined, citing his disinclination to speak in parliament. With the aid of Walpole he influenced his brother to remain part of the Chatham administration. After the latter resigned in 1768, Hertford worked with some success to prevent him from drawing too close to the opposition, at least until the outbreak of the war with the American colonies in 1775. Hertford himself continued to support Lord North's administration and the war in America, in which three of his sons served. His correspondence with Walpole, however, shows him to have doubted the prospects of its success. In 1779 he again acted as an intermediary in negotiations designed to shore up an embattled ministry, unsuccessfully approaching members of the opposition through the duke of Grafton, his wife's nephew.<br>
<br>Following Lord North into opposition in 1782, Hertford became more of a party politician. He voted by proxy against Shelburne's peace preliminaries in February 1783. He then briefly returned to office with the Fox&#150;North coalition and resumed his old post as lord chamberlain. After being dismissed with the coalition at the end of the year, he again followed North into opposition, reportedly spurning the younger Pitt's offer of a marquessate. He opposed Pitt's <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in 1788. In the realignment that followed the outbreak of war with revolutionary France he finally went over to Pitt, and on 3 July 1793 was created marquess of Hertford and earl of Yarmouth. The owner of extensive estates in co. Antrim, he also exerted influence in Irish politics. He served a relatively uneventful term as lord lieutenant in 1765&#150;6 and had a decisive influence on elections in the borough of Lisburn, which was briefly shaken by the Volunteer movement in 1783.<br>
<br>Hertford died on 14 June 1794 from complications resulting from a riding accident at the home of his daughter, the countess of Lincoln, in Putney. He was buried on 23 June at Arrow, Warwickshire, where his wife had been buried twelve years earlier. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25167/', "Francis Ingram-Seymour-Conway (1743&#150;1822)")</script>, politician, succeeded to the titles.<br>
