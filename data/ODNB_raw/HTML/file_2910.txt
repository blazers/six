<span class="headword">Borlase,  William</span>  (1696&#150;1772), <span class="occ">antiquary and naturalist</span>, was born on 2 February 1696, the second son of John Borlase (1666&#150;1755), landowner and twice MP for St Ives, and his wife, Lydia (<i>c</i>.1671&#150;1725), youngest daughter of Christopher Harris of Hayne, Devon, at their home, Pendeen House, in the parish of St Just, Cornwall. The Borlases were said to be the descendants of a Norman family who had settled in Cornwall. He was sent to Christopher Pender's school in Penzance until 1709, when he started attending the Revd Mr Bedford's school in Plymouth. In March 1713 he entered Exeter College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1716 and proceeded MA in 1719. He was admitted into deacon's orders by Lancelot, bishop of Exeter, in 1719, and was ordained the following year. His father purchased for him the right of presentation to the rectory of Ludgvan, Cornwall, and, after some problems resolved with the assistance of Sir John Hobart, later the earl of Buckingham, he was presented to his living on 22 April 1722. He would spend the rest of his long life at the rectory at Ludgvan, also holding from 1732 the living of St Just. On 28 July 1724 at Illogan, Cornwall, he married Anne (1703&#150;1769), eldest surviving daughter of the Revd W. M. Smith, rector of Camborne and Illogan, and his wife, Mary Farthing. They had six children, all boys, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>As well as having interests in &#145;gardening and planting&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1115) and reading the classics, Borlase began collecting minerals and fossils. The copperworks of Lord Godolphin were in Ludgvan parish, and Borlase had access &#145;with the greatest ease&#146;  (ibid.) to such material. Friends to whom he sent various specimens<blockquote>encouraged him now first to think of studying the natural history of his native county, and look more narrowly into the structure and properties of the so much commended fossils, as well as trace the other, though less interesting bounties of nature. (ibid.)</blockquote>These interests also stimulated a fascination with the &#145;many monuments of remote antiquity&#146;  (ibid.) which abounded in the region and which, he found, had either been overlooked or under-rated by previous examiners and writers. He became particularly interested in &#145;the study of the Druid learning; with the religion and customs of the ancient Britons before their conversion to Christianity, intending to describe and explain the several unknown, or hitherto ill understood, remains in Cornwall&#146;  (ibid.). He was assisted early on in these projects by his friend the Revd Edward Collins, the vicar of St Erth, as well as by his wife, who helped in the collecting and recording of samples. On antiquarian matters he corresponded with his friend Francis Wise, a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and later first Radcliffe librarian. Though Borlase was a good draughtsman and recognized the importance of making drawings and measurements of antiquities he was, however, mistaken in identifying natural rock basins as sacred structures built by the druids.<br>
<br>Borlase sent samples of the minerals he found, including tin, copper, iron, and lead ores, to his friend John Andrew, an Oxford physician, who in 1735 went to Leiden to study under Herman Boerhaave. Andrew passed on samples to Boerhaave, Carl Linnaeus, and J. F. Gronovius, and Borlase entered into a correspondence with the last. Andrew returned to Britain in 1738 with a copy of Linnaeus's <span class="italic">System of Botany</span> for Borlase. Through the introduction by their mutual friend William Oliver of Bath, in 1739 and 1740 Borlase also supplied samples of Cornish minerals to the poet Alexander Pope, who used them to decorate the grotto in his garden at Twickenham. Pope erected an inscription to Borlase in the grotto, and sent him a copy of his works as thanks.<br>
<br>Borlase's studies were hampered, as he realized, by his distance from the centres of learning of London and Oxford, a problem he could never fully overcome. In 1740 he proposed to the archdeacon of Cornwall the establishment of a library at Truro for the use of clergy and gentry, but this suggestion would not be realized until 1792. In 1748 he met and made friends with the Revd Dr Charles Lyttelton and Jeremiah Milles, who were both influential fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London. They assisted and encouraged him in the undertaking of his work on Cornish natural history and antiquities. In the same year he began a correspondence with Emanuel Mendes da Costa FRS, a naturalist and mineralogist from London of Portuguese Jewish descent, who visited him in 1749 to study mines and geology. In 1750 da Costa successfully proposed him for fellowship of the Royal Society in recognition of his essay &#145;Spar and sparry productions, called Cornish diamonds&#146;, which was published in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. Da Costa also put Borlase in touch with the antiquarian William Stukeley, who shared a similar fascination with ancient religion and druids, but their correspondence was only short-lived.<br>
<br>Borlase spent the months between July 1753 and January 1754 in Oxford, supervising the printing and publication of his <span class="italic">Observations on the antiquities historical and monumental, of the county of Cornwall. Consisting of several essays on the first inhabitants, Druid-superstition, and remains of the most remote antiquity, in Britain, and the British Isles</span> (1754; 2nd edn, 1769). This work was the first chronological account of the antiquities of the county, and the first book to describe, illustrate, and classify a significant number of them. It was divided into four sections: the early history of Britain with special reference to Cornwall; the rites and practices of the druids; the prehistoric monuments of Cornwall; and the Roman and later antiquities. An index included an English&#150;Cornish vocabulary.<br>
<br>In 1752 Borlase travelled with his friend Henry Usticke to the Isles of Scilly, where they measured and recorded barrows, stone circles, and rock basins. His account of the islands was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (vol. 48, 1758, p. 55), and enlarged into a book, <span class="italic">Observations on the Ancient and Present State of the Islands of Scilly</span> (1756). This volume was praised by Samuel Johnson as &#145;one of the most pleasing and elegant pieces of local enquiry that our country has produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Magazine</span>, 1/2, 1756, 91). Between 1738 and 1751 Borlase took the sons of local gentry into his home to educate, and many of these retained a close affection for their tutor. In the summers of 1744 and 1745 he came into conflict with John Wesley, who was successfully recruiting many of Borlase's parishioners to Methodism, and in his capacity as a magistrate he summoned Wesley before the local court.<br>
<br>Between 1752 and 1757 (with the exception of 1754) Borlase made tours around central and eastern Cornwall gathering material for his next book. He had hoped to publish a topographical survey of the county, but this ambition was beyond the capacity of one man, by then in his sixties, and he abandoned the plan in 1757. But <span class="italic">The Natural History of Cornwall</span> was published at Oxford in 1758, following which he donated his collection of fossils, minerals, and antiquities to the Ashmolean Museum. In acknowledgement of this gift, and in recognition of his achievements in literature and antiquarianism, on 23 March 1766 the university conferred upon him by diploma the degree of doctor of law. After this date Borlase devoted his time to more sedentary pastimes such as painting, and though a second edition of <span class="italic">Antiquities</span> was published in London in 1769, he abandoned the publication of his &#145;Private thoughts concerning the creation and the deluge&#146; (a reconciliation of the Mosaic account with the fossil record) while it was at the press.<br>
<br>Borlase died at home in Ludgvan following a long illness on 31 August 1772, and was buried in the chancel of his church at Ludgvan on 3 September 1772. An obituary, probably written by his brother Walter, recorded that William<blockquote>was remarkably attentive to the affairs of his parish, and the regularity of his parishioners, was affable and easy of access &hellip; Though he was not admired as a preacher, yet several specimens he has left in manuscript, not unworthy of publication, prove that his studies were not confined to Antiquities or Natural History. (Walter Borlase MSS)</blockquote>His wife predeceased him, and only two of his six sons survived him: the Revd John Borlase and the Revd George Borlase, casuistical professor and registrar of the University of Cambridge.<br>
