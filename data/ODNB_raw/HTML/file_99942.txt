<span class="headword">Holme,  Richard Gordon</span>, Baron Holme of Cheltenham  (1936&#150;2008), <span class="occ">politician and businessman</span>, was born on 27 May 1936 at 19 Bolingbroke Drive, Battersea, London, the only son of Jack Richard Holme, a detective constable in the Metropolitan Police, and his wife, Edna May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eggleton. His father, a lieutenant in the intelligence corps, was killed in action in 1940. As a son of a freemason, Holme boarded at the Royal Masonic School in Bushey, Hertfordshire. His national service was spent with the 10th Gurkha rifles in Malaya between 1954 and 1956. At St John's College, Oxford, he read jurisprudence, and joined the Liberals in 1959. On 4 July 1958, while still a student, he had married Kathleen Mary (Kay) Powell (<i>b</i>. 1938), daughter of Vincent Tom Powell, surgeon. They had two daughters followed by twin sons.<br>
<br>Holme had a varied and successful business career. After graduating with a second-class degree in 1959 he took marketing posts with Lever Brothers and then Cavenham Foods. He then moved into publishing, a lifelong interest, becoming a director first at Penguin Books and then at the British Printing Corporation's books division, of which he become chief executive in 1969. In the same year he moved to San Diego, California, as vice-president of a publishing company. In 1974 he decided to return to Britain, having accumulated enough money to concentrate on seeking a seat and advancing the Liberal cause. He fought Braintree in the general election of October that year. He had already fought East Grinstead for the Liberals in the general election of 1964 and in a by-election the following year.<br>
<br>Holme was a distinctive Liberal activist, becoming a day-by-day unpaid key adviser to the party leaders, David Steel then Paddy Ashdown. He had more influence than perhaps any other Liberal front-bench spokesman and was almost a permanent part of the party power structure. He had been vice-chairman of the Liberal executive in 1966 and became president of the party in 1980&#150;81. He worked patiently for the party to exercise influence rather than be a debating society. He had joined the party when Jo Grimond was leader in the 1950s and had held out the hope of a centre-left realignment. This was a guiding theme in Holme's political life. In large part because of his role as a &#145;fixer&#146;, broker, and spin doctor, he was often distrusted by some party activists, who were suspicious of the leadership's attempts to work more closely with Labour and feared that such tactics would compromise Liberal principles. He usually had to prompt Steel to overcome his natural caution but had to urge patience on the more headstrong Ashdown. It was Holme who drafted the K&ouml;nigswinter compact in 1981 between the leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Liberals, an initiative that led to the formation of the alliance and eventually, in 1988, the Liberal Democrat Party.<br>
<br>Not becoming an MP was a disappointment to Holme. He had good prospects as the Liberal and then the Liberal Democrat candidate in the general elections of 1983 and 1987 at Cheltenham. After his narrow failure in 1987 he decided after five attempts to retire from the fray. Ironically, a Liberal Democrat candidate won the seat in 1992. Having been appointed CBE in 1983, he became a life peer, as Baron Holme of Cheltenham, in 1990, and between 1992 and 1999 he was the party's Northern Ireland spokesman.<br>
<br>Having managed the Liberal Democrat general election campaign in 1997, which brought a third party its largest number of MPs since the 1920s, and having taken part in the pre-election coalition talks with Tony Blair, Holme was one of the five-strong Liberal Democrat team that sat on the Liberal Democrat&#150;Labour joint cabinet committee between 1997 and 1999. He had long been an advocate of wide-ranging constitutional reform. Indeed he established his own think-tank, the Centre for Constitutional Reform, in 1985. He was able to see many of his hopes for constitutional reform fulfilled in the first years of the Blair government. When Ashdown resigned the party leadership in 1999, to be succeeded by Charles Kennedy, Holme thought it wise to step back from his leadership-counselling role.<br>
<br>Holme had an enormous range of contacts in business and in politics and was widely trusted and respected for his judgement. His political activities spanned the political divide, although they were always progressive in direction. He played an important role in founding the Green Alliance (though his post as a director of Rio Tinto Zinc between 1985 and 1988 upset some of his &#145;green&#146; friends), and Charter 88. He served as chairman of the Hansard Society between 2001 and 2007 and held a number of visiting academic appointments, including that of chancellor of Greenwich University from 1988. He wrote a number of books and pamphlets, including <span class="italic">No Dole for the Young</span> (1975), <span class="italic">A Democracy Which Works</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">The People's Kingdom</span> (1987), and he was a joint editor of <span class="italic">1688&#150;1988: Time for a New Constitution</span> (1988). He was deputy chairman of the Independent Television Commission and then became chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, from which he resigned in 2000 after tabloid revelations about an extramarital affair.<br>
<br>Holme was immediately recognizable with his military moustache, tall and erect bearing, good looks, elegant attire, and warmth. Many eagerly sought his company because of his charm, quick mind, and enthusiasm for new ideas. Despite being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer early in 2007 he carried on with some of his activities. These included the chairmanship of GlobeScan, a market research company specializing in environmental issues, and of the House of Lords constitutional committee until his term ended in October of that year. He died on 4 May 2008 at his home, Hazards, Lurgashall, Sussex, and was survived by his wife and their four children.<br>
