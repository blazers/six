<span class="headword">O'Hara,  Charles</span>, first Baron Tyrawley  (<em>d.</em> 1724), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was probably from Leyny, co. Sligo. A henchman and client of the Butlers, dukes of Ormond, O'Hara attended James Butler, later second duke, probably as riding master, during his travels to France in 1675. In 1678 he was a captain in the Duke of York's Foot, but on 15 December 1679, his company having been disbanded, he was commissioned lieutenant of Henry Cornwall's company in Ossory's regiment in the Anglo-Dutch brigade. Having received a captaincy in the 1st foot (Grenadier) guards on 9 April 1686, he disposed of his Dutch commission to John Lister in May and returned to England. He negotiated the revolution of 1688 without personal mishap and, favoured as a former Dutch officer, was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 1st foot guards on 16 March 1689, simultaneously receiving a brevet as colonel of infantry. Knighted on 27 August 1689, he fought in Flanders under William III and was promoted brigadier-general on 20 December 1695. On 12 November 1696, while in garrison in Ghent, he was appointed colonel of the Royal Fusiliers (7th foot) and subsequently entrusted with conducting many of the demobilizations between 1697 and 1699.<br>
<br>O'Hara was raised to the rank of major-general on 9 March 1702 and appointed one of the three officers of this rank to accompany the duke of Ormond's expedition to Cadiz in 1703 as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. He exercised a quiet influence over the duke, a reflection of their earlier master&#150;pupil relationship. The advice of this calm, modest, competent soldier was normally sound&#151;he &#145;does not want sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 3.1520). Lacking independent means and reliant upon military pay and emoluments, he succumbed to temptation after the capture of Puerto Santa Maria and both permitted, and benefited from, widespread looting and pillage. Although O'Hara distinguished himself at the capture of Vigo and the destruction of the Spanish treasure fleet, he and Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Belasyse were arrested and court-martialled on their return to England. On the advice of the duke of Marlborough, the episode was played down, resulting in the acquittal of O'Hara. On 1 January 1704 he was promoted lieutenant-general. Recommended for a senior command in Spain in 1705, it was not until the following year that he assumed the duties of second-in-command to the earl of Galway, although his position was uncertain and disputed by the plethora of general officers attending Galway and the earl of Peterborough. In late July 1706 he commanded a detachment that prevented a French attempt to surprise the allies at Guadalajara. For this and other notable services during the 1706 campaign he was raised to an Irish barony, taking his title from Tyrawley in co. Mayo. At a council of war on 15 January 1707 held in Valencia, he strongly supported Galway and Stanhope in advocating an offensive against Madrid with undivided forces. The three generals put their arguments in writing and sent them to England. At the battle of Almanza (14 April 1707) he commanded the left of the allied army. His initial advance pushed back the French right before being held and repulsed; he then successfully withstood the French counter-attack. Although wounded, he led his forces back to Tortosa. He returned to England in September 1707 and unsuccessfully petitioned for &pound;1000 compensation for his lost equipage. Having taken his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 25 May 1710, he was sworn of the Irish privy council, and resworn by George I in 1714.<br>
<br>In January 1711 the tories in the House of Lords initiated an investigation into the perceived mismanagement of the campaign of 1707 in Spain in order to cement their new alliance with the earl of Peterborough. Galway and Tyrawley were summoned to account for their actions, concentrating especially on the council of war of 15 January 1707. Both successfully argued that they had been obeying orders from the secretary of state, the earl of Sunderland. When pressed further, Tyrawley said that he had fought with the sword, not the pen. He had not carried ink with him and he had not kept a register and could therefore only recall generalities not details. Indeed, there was nothing in the official papers implicating him in anything other than the decision to launch the offensive against Madrid. A resolution declared that he was one of those responsible for the decision to advance on Madrid and for the conduct of the battle of Almanza. Galway and Tyrawley petitioned for time to produce answers and they were supported by two protests from the whig peers; no further action was taken.<br>
<br>Having resigned his colonelcy to his son on 15 November 1714, Tyrawley was appointed commander-in-chief in Ireland, remaining in office until 1721. He was sometime governor of Kilmainham Hospital. Before 1682 he had married Frances, daughter of Gervase Rouse of Rous Lench, Worcestershire, who died on 10 November 1733 and was buried in St Mary's, Dublin. They had at least two children, including a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20634/', "James O'Hara, second baron")</script>, general and diplomatist, and a daughter, Mary, who died in 1759. Tyrawley died in Dublin on 8 or 9 June 1724 and was buried on 11 June in the chancel vault of St Mary's, Dublin.<br>
