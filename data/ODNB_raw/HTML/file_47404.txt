<span class="headword">Wyatt,  George</span>  (1553&#150;1624), <span class="occ">landowner and writer</span>, was born at Allington Castle, Kent, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30112/', "Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger (b. in or before 1521, d. 1554)")</script>, soldier, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. in or after 1595), the daughter of Sir William Haute or Hart of Bishopbourne, Kent. The family was impoverished by Sir Thomas's attainder in 1554, and although Jane received lands and an annuity from Queen Mary in 1555 to a total value of about &pound;200 per annum she never remarried, and her sons never obtained their father's or grandfather's place in Kentish society. The family was restored in blood in 1570, by which time George was the only surviving son. He was granted a small property at Wavering by the crown, and entered Gray's Inn in 1571. Although he left a number of writings, none of them was published, and only the skeleton of his career can be reconstructed with certainty. In 1582 he married Jane, the daughter of Sir Thomas Finch of Eastwell; they had five sons and four daughters. It can be deduced from his own words that he saw active service as a soldier, probably in the Low Countries, and was present at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom in 1588, although in what capacity is not clear. The Mr Wiatt who was muster-master there from 1588 to 1591 was always referred to (and referred to himself) as Thomas, as was the &#145;Capten Wiatt&#146; who assisted Lord Cobham and Sir Thomas Wilford with the Kentish musters in the late 1590s. George Wyatt had settled down in Kent by 1593, but, as he complained to Lord Cobham, &#145;mine estate forceth me to retire myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 31). By 1618 he had at last inherited his mother's properties at Boxley and Southfleet, and in 1622 he recovered his family's possession of Boxley Abbey. He died there in August 1624 and was buried in the parish church. His wife survived him by twenty years, dying about 1644 at the age of over eighty.<br>
<br>George Wyatt was the obscure son of a famous father, and the obscure father of famous sons. Hawte, who died in 1638, was the father of Edward, the progenitor of the Virginia Wiatts, and Wyatt's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30102/', "Sir Francis Wyatt")</script>, who died in 1644, was the first royal governor of Virginia. George's main claim to fame is the papers which he wrote and collected in the latter part of his life, which provide some vivid and proximate insights into the careers of his father and grandfather, and into the military problems of late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England. One of the most interesting is his eulogistic treatise in defence of Anne Boleyn (<i>c</i>.1605), which contains a circumstantial account of Sir Thomas Wyatt's journey to Rome in 1527. George was born many years after his grandfather's death, but the story may have been handed down in the family. Another is his letter to his son Sir Francis written in 1622 and containing such comments as &#145;I see by the map I have of the last, and by your letter, your Plantation is d[r]awen out into long, weak and skattered inhabitation with smale and unapt defences&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 113); it was written shortly after the destructive Indian revolt of the same year. Virtually everything which is known about George Wyatt derives from these papers, and particularly those which were put together into a commonplace book by his descendant Richard Wyatt in 1727. This commonplace book was edited for the Camden Society by David Loades in 1968.<br>
