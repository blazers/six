<span class="headword">Bisset <span class="st"> [Bissait]</span>,  Baldred</span>  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1311?), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic</span>, is best known for advocating the cause of Scottish independence before Pope Boniface VIII in 1301. Traditionally believed to originate in Stirlingshire, Bisset may have been related to William Biset, lord of Upsettlington, Berwickshire, who was constable of Stirling Castle in 1306 under Edward I and briefly a Stirlingshire landholder during the reign of Robert I.<br>
<br>According to David Buchanan, writing in the first half of the seventeenth century, Bisset attended school in Stirling, studied philosophy at St Andrews, and furthered his studies in France. But no contemporary evidence supports such a claim, and the first reliable record places him in Bologna in 1277, when he was styled <i>Dominus</i>; he was called &#145;Master&#146; by 1284 and most probably graduated as doctor of civil law, since he was described as <i>Dottor di Legge</i> (&#145;Doctor of law&#146;) in 1305.<br>
<br>Bisset pursued a career in the Scottish church in the 1280s. He was a canon of Caithness by August 1284, and was rector of Kinghorn in St Andrews diocese by 19 September 1289. He apparently remained in possession of the Kinghorn living until his replacement, some time between 1296 and 1301, by an English cleric, Peter of Dunwich. He learned of this while in Bologna, and appealed directly to Rome late in 1304, and by proxy at the diocesan court of St Andrews shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>Before his return to Bologna, Bisset held a key position in diocesan administration as official of St Andrews, presiding over the bishop's ordinary court during the episcopate of William Fraser (1280&#150;97). He appears in this office before October 1282 and continued to hold it until some time in 1289. During the same decade he took part in litigation between the sees of York and Durham, apparently supporting the latter. Little is known of his career during the 1290s, though he may well have taught law in Bologna.<br>
<br>Bisset's most enduring legacy, however, was as spokesman for the Scottish cause at the papal curia in 1301, while John Soulis was acting as guardian for the exiled King John, who had been forced to abdicate in 1296. After Boniface VIII had addressed his bull <span class="italic">Scimus, fili</span> to Edward I in 1299, claiming papal supremacy over Scotland, the English king, in his reply of 1301, adduced historical evidence to support his right to the overlordship of Scotland. Edward's letter included references to legendary material derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth, which inspired a reply in kind.<br>
<br>The Scottish government appointed Master William Frere, archdeacon of Lothian, to lead a commission that included Bisset and Master William of Eaglesham. The three Scottish proctors worked on a reply to Edward's letter in July 1301. Three separate drafts of an informal version, known somewhat misleadingly as the &#145;Instructions&#146;, were composed. Two of these survive as full texts in fifteenth-century manuscripts of an appendix to John Fordun's <span class="italic">Chronica gentis Scotorum</span> and of Walter Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span>. A briefer version, known as the <span class="italic">Processus</span> (&#145;Pleading&#146;), also survives, though there is no evidence it was ever presented in court; in any case, Boniface reversed his previous support for the Scottish side in August 1302.<br>
<br>Bisset may well have been the principal author of the &#145;Instructions&#146; and &#145;Pleading&#146;, as a number of early Scottish chronicles suggest. The author shows himself a skilful polemicist with a good knowledge of canon and civil law and well informed about thirteenth-century Anglo-Scottish relations. To counter Edward's argument from the legendary history of the Britons, Bisset adapts a legend that traced Scottish origins back to Scota, daughter of the Egyptian pharaoh, and her husband, Gaythelos, a Greek prince. At the same time, Bisset was sophisticated enough to argue that recent history provides evidence that is more relevant and better documented than that of the remote past.<br>
<br>Bisset returned to Bologna after his activities in the papal curia and was appointed vicar-general there to Bishop Hubert by April 1305. He seems to have spent most of his remaining life on the continent, where he occasionally appeared at Avignon. But he went on an embassy to Lanercost, to meet with Edward I late in 1306, after Robert I's usurpation of the throne; Bisset's purpose is unclear, but he may have sought to negotiate against Bruce's interests. Bisset's last important activity was to lead the defence of Boniface VIII in a posthumous trial in the consistory at Avignon. He was still alive on 27 April 1311, when he was mentioned in a record of Pope Clement V, and probably died soon thereafter.<br>
