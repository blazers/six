<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baylis,  Lilian Mary</span>  (1874&#150;1937), <span class="occ">theatre manager</span>, was born at 19 Nottingham Street, Marylebone, London, on 9 May 1874, the eldest daughter of Edward William Baylis, an employee of Gillows furniture store in Oxford Street and a baritone singer (known as Newton Baylis), and his wife, Elizabeth Cons, a contralto singer and pianist. The eldest of ten children (five of whom survived infancy), Lilian was educated at home and later attended a convent school, St Augustine's in Kilburn, on alternate weeks. She also received tuition from the violinist and composer John Tiplady Carrodus. When Lilian was seventeen the family emigrated to south Africa, where they toured musical acts under the name of the Gipsy Revellers. After settling in Johannesburg, Lilian spent a five-year period managing an orchestra for women.<br>
<br>In 1898, following a period of ill health in south Africa, Lilian returned to London for a visit. Rather than going back to her family, she stayed on in London to assist her aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37310/', "Emma Cons")</script> in running the Victoria Theatre, Waterloo Road, Lambeth, familiarly known as the Old Vic. As a pioneer of housing reform and many other social improvements to working-class lives, especially women's lives, Emma Cons had acquired the Victoria in 1880 with the specific purpose of transforming it from a rather unsavoury, run-down venue into an alcohol-free site of family entertainment. Running the Old Vic as a temperance hall, aunt and niece had always to find forms of entertainment that would compensate for the absence of alcohol. Their programme relied heavily on costume recitals and ballad concerts, and, in the interests of variety, they explored the possibilities of cinema, symphony concerts, military bands, and, like many of the music-halls, the performance of sketches and scenes from theatre. Their endeavours benefited at the turn of the century from the appointment of Charles Corri to the position of music director. Nevertheless, their hall ran into increasing financial difficulties&#151;not least because of the constant demands made by the London county council for improvements to health and safety aspects of the building.<br>
<br>A major change came after Emma's death in July 1912, as Lilian succeeded her in management and began to steer the theatre on a different course. She obtained a theatre licence from the lord chamberlain so that she could start staging Shakespeare. The first two attempts to introduce Shakespeare to the Old Vic&#151;by the actress Rosina Filippi, who wanted to launch a people's theatre, and by the actor Shakespeare Stewart&#151;met with failure. Lilian herself pursued both the idea of a people's theatre and Shakespeare, and managed to succeed where the others had failed. Her success was due in part to the actor&#150;manager Ben Greet, who, having recently returned from America, joined her as director in 1914. The first season of combined opera and Shakespeare ran from October 1914 until April 1915 and included sixteen operas and sixteen plays. Working to an extremely low budget, Greet's productions were plain, rather than spectacular, cut to suit the tastes of an ordinary audience and Lilian's demand for a curtain down at 10.30 p.m. Initially the box-office receipts from the opera had to subsidize the Shakespeare, but gradually Lilian's determination paid off: Shakespeare found an audience at the Old Vic&#151;an audience, moreover, that included schoolchildren for the new Shakespearian matin&eacute;es.<br>
<br>Through Greet came other contacts beneficial to the Old Vic, most notably the actress Sybil Thorndike, who joined the Vic in 1915 and, like Greet, stayed throughout the wartime years. 1915 also saw the inauguration of a new tradition at the Vic: the morality play <span class="italic">Everyman</span>, which remained in the repertory as an annual event at Lent. For Lilian, with her deeply religious outlook and her faith in God, whom she believed guided her in her work for the theatre (as did her lifelong spiritual adviser, Father Andrew, superior of a neo-Franciscan order), <span class="italic">Everyman</span> held a special interest. As Sybil Thorndike explained, this was &#145;one of the few plays she watched through from start to finish&#146;  (Thorndike and Thorndike, 40&#150;41).<br>
<br>Lilian's theatrical management was always tempestuous. She was iron-willed and determined to put the theatre before all else. Her dedication to the theatre's survival meant that she offered permanently low wages and delayed costly improvements to the building. During wartime she insisted that the performers carry on, even through bombing raids. Because of her fierce temper, she was constantly rowing with (and, in consequence, losing) staff. Tired of his stormy relationship with Lilian, Greet left the Old Vic in 1918. She waited for the former member of the company Robert Aitkins to come back from the war to take his place. Aitkins overhauled the Shakespeare repertory in the interests of quality and stayed on as director until 1925. He was succeeded by Andrew Leigh (1925&#150;9), Harcourt Williams (1929&#150;33), and, thereafter, Tyrone Guthrie.<br>
<br>Lilian's 1925&#150;6 Shakespeare season at the Old Vic was very successful, not least because the West End star Edith Evans joined the theatre. Other West End performers were to follow over the years&#151;most notably John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier. The 1920s also brought Lilian personal success: in 1924 she was made an honorary MA of Oxford University in recognition for her work at the Old Vic, and in 1929 she was granted admission to the Order of the Companions of Honour (the only theatrical manager to be admitted at that time, and one of just a very few women to join the order).<br>
<br>However, the 1920s also brought a major problem for her theatre. Under Emma Cons's management, the Old Vic had established an educational branch for its activities, Morley College, which for twenty-five years had operated out of the theatre. As both institutions grew, so it became necessary to separate them, and, in consequence, to rehouse the college and refurbish the Old Vic. Lilian had the exhausting task of raising funds to ensure a future for both ventures. As testimony to her enterprise, she not only played a key role in the reorganization of the theatre and the college, but she also undertook to raise funds to renovate a second venue, Sadler's Wells. Sadler's Wells opened on 6 January 1931 to become the venue for opera and ballet companies, with the ballet overseen by Ninette de Valois. Lilian kept up managerial involvement in both venues until her death. She died of a heart attack on 25 November 1937 at her home, 27 Stockwell Park Road, London, and was cremated at the end of the month.<br>
<br>Lilian Baylis is chiefly remembered for her work in making the Old Vic the home of Shakespeare. The theatre teems with stories about her. Her bluntness was legendary, as when she brusquely explained why a singer, the daughter of a potential benefactor of Sadler's Wells, had never been offered a part: &#145;She hasn't got any voice&#146;  (Dent, 40). Sybil Thorndike, arriving at the last minute for a performance at the Old Vic during the First World War after crossing London during an air raid, found her fretting and fuming at the pit door, and not inclined to accept the explanation for her lateness: &#145;&#147;Raid&#148;, she snorted, &#147;What's a raid when my curtain's up&#148;&#146;  (Thorndike and Thorndike, 58&#150;9). Theatrical biographies variously describe her as &#145;a cockney cinderella who achieved a throne without a prince&#146;  (Findlater, 65) and as &#145;the most courageous woman that was ever associated with the Theatre&#146;  (Thorndike and Thorndike, 7).<br>
