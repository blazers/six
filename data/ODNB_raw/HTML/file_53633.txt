<span class="headword">Norton,  James Lansdowne</span>  (1869&#150;1925), <span class="occ">motorcycle designer and manufacturer</span>, was born at 37 Spon Terrace, Aston, Birmingham, on 8 January 1869, the son of James Norton, a journeyman cabinet-maker, and his wife, Elizabeth Chinn. The family were members of the Salvation Army, in which Norton remained active throughout his life. He demonstrated mechanical aptitude at an early age, being apprenticed as a toolmaker and working on bicycle chains. In 1888 he suffered a severe attack of rheumatic fever; a transatlantic voyage helped him to recuperate, but he was prematurely aged, earning the nickname &#145;Pa&#146;, in honour of his white hair and beard.<br>
<br>In 1898 Norton set up the Norton Manufacturing Company in Bromsgrove Street, Birmingham. On 30 October that year he married Sarah, daughter of Charles Henry Saxelby, a clockmaker, at the Salvation Army Citadel. There were five children of the marriage. Norton's small company, employing only a few men and boys, initially made bicycle chains but he was quick to see the potential of the motorized bicycle. In 1902 his friend Charles Garrard began to import French Clement engines for Clement-Garrard machines. Norton built Garrard's frames and advertised his own Clement-engined machine. The following year he expanded the manufacturing capacity of the company and in 1904 adopted larger engines when the Garrard work ended. Although initially committed to lightweight machines, Norton responded to public demand for more powerful engines.<br>
<br>Norton motorcycles reflected the fact that the designer and manufacturer was also an active competition rider. Norton's experience was reflected in machines that relied on simple proven systems, light weight, and good road-holding. The emphasis on competition and improvement came at the expense of production and profit, but brought its own pay-off with a win at the inaugural Isle of Man Tourist Trophy (TT) races in 1907. Norton used the resulting orders and publicity to fund the design of his own engine, the single-cylinder type that would be the basis of Norton production until 1963. This engine demonstrated a practical appreciation of metallurgical problems and the need to dissipate heat from the exhaust port. Nortons competed in the TT every year from 1907, but without success. By 1910 Norton was seen as the father figure of the industry, despite the small size of his company.<br>
<br>Unfortunately poor financial management forced Norton in 1913 to sell the company to his major component suppliers, R. T. Shelley. Recognizing that Norton was the company, Shelley retained him as managing director, with a nominee finance director. Competition remained the basis of development and several world records were secured at Brooklands. As a result the simple Norton side-valve machine was faster than its more complex, and apparently more advanced, rivals, reflecting Norton's design philosophy. He was the last manufacturer to fit a conventional gearbox, in 1915.<br>
<br>In 1914 the Norton company was too small for direct sales to the armed forces, so it was able to continue supplying the civilian market, where greater profits could be made. By 1919 the company had a reputation for fast and reliable machines. Norton, anticipating the roller-coaster trading conditions of the early 1920s, and fearful that trade unions and restrictive practices would destroy business, suffered a nervous breakdown in mid-1919. In 1920 the company moved to Bracebridge Street, its home for the next forty-three years. Second place in the 1920 TT encouraged Norton to pursue another win, which he realized would be the key to strong sales. To this end he developed an overhead-valve engine and experimented with mechanically closed valves, the desmodromic system, for which he patented a design in 1924. The simple overhead-valve engine proved adequate, breaking the 500 cc world speed record on its first outing in 1922.<br>
<br>Over the winter of 1921&#150;2 Norton spent six months in South Africa, where he visited his brother and rode 3000 miles on a sales trip. Shortly after his return to England terminal cancer of the bowel was diagnosed. His machines, however, continued to perform well: two second places at the 1923 TT on standard machines boosted sales. Finally in 1924 the company, prompted by Castrol Oils, agreed to hire a professional racer, Alec Bennett, who secured the elusive win. Bennett also won the other major events that year, the Belgian and French grands prix. In July Norton was the guest of honour at a civic reception in Birmingham, his last public appearance. His machines were now acknowledged to be the best in the world.<br>
<br>Norton died from cancer at his home, 24 Sampson Road, Birmingham, on 21 April 1925, aged fifty-six. He was buried at Lodge Hill cemetery, Birmingham, on 24 April. Within days Norton Motors marked the passing of a man loved and respected by all who knew him, and of whom <span class="italic">Motor Cycling</span> could say, in its obituary notice of 29 April 1925, &#145;the advanced design of motorcycles of today has been largely due to his skill and knowledge&#146;, by sacking his eldest son and cutting off all connection with the Norton family. Norton had an enormous influence on the development of motorcycles and the industry that built them, an area where Britain was the world leader for fifty years. His name still commands worldwide recognition.<br>
