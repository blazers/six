<span class="headword">Bownd,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was one of at least three sons of Robert Bound (<i>d</i>. in or before 1573), physician to the duke of Norfolk and living in Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Katherine Wood (<i>d</i>. 1612). It is not known whether he was educated at Eton College like his elder brother Alexander (1547/8&#150;1622), but like him went to Cambridge, matriculating from Peterhouse in Michaelmas 1568. He graduated BA early in 1572, and that year became a fellow. In August 1573, if not before, he acquired connections among the East Anglian godly when his widowed mother married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11424/', "Richard Greenham (early 1540s&#150;1594)")</script>, rector of Dry Drayton, Cambridgeshire. Having proceeded MA in 1575, he followed his brother Alexander into the ministry, being ordained deacon and priest at Ely on 2 June 1580. With <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7729/', "John Dod")</script>, who was also ordained at Ely that year and who married Bownd's sister Ann in or after 1585, he formed part of a nucleus of Jacobean clergy trained in Greenham's &#145;rectory seminary&#146;, and he was among the minority of Suffolk ministers who &#145;resolved not to subscribe&#146; to Archbishop John Whitgift's articles of 1583 targeting nonconformity  (R. G. Usher, ed., <span class="italic">The Presbyterian Movement in the Reign of Elizabeth I</span>, CS, 3rd ser., 8, 1905, xlix). He was instituted on 3 September 1585 to the rectory of Norton, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. At some point he resigned his fellowship, and on 3 October 1592 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1627), widow of John More (1542&#150;1592), the late puritan minister of St Andrew's, Norwich; she already had two daughters. The Norton registers show this to have been Bownd's third marriage, his two wives having predeceased him and having been buried at Norton. Bownd also had three sons, one of whom, Nathaniel, later preached a sermon at St Paul's Cross. He proceeded DD in 1594.<br>
<br>Bownd took on the mantle of More's literary executor and on 24 August 1593 signed the preface of More's <span class="italic">A Table from the Beginning of the World to this Day</span> (1593), dedicated to Edmund Scambler, bishop of Norwich, and the city corporation. However, Bownd is perhaps best-known for his published works on the Christian sabbath. His early reflections on this subject, dating from about 1586, were presented in a series of sermons, eventually published as <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Sabbath</span> (1595) with a dedication to Bownd's patron Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, and a full-page engraving of his arms. Bownd's work articulated a theological understanding of Sunday observance that had become a growing concern for many godly Elizabethan protestants. He emphasized the morally binding character of the fourth commandment, the divine institution of the sabbath as the Lord's day, the duty to rest and worship on Sunday, and the cessation of non-religious activities (working, festivals, sports, markets) that distracted from devotion and acts of mercy. Because of clerical quarrels in Suffolk and political rivalries surrounding Devereux, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Sabbath</span> was condemned in 1599. Bownd's local clerical protagonist Thomas Rogers tarred his sabbatarian teaching as &#145;papistry or Brownism&#146; in a sermon delivered on 10 December that year  (BL, Add. MS 38492, fol. 104).<br>
<br>In his early career at least, Bownd was an active member of the classis movement and was among those who presided over the celebrated combination lecture at Bury St Edmunds. Following the pastoral example of his stepfather, he occupied himself with preaching and the cure of afflicted consciences. These concerns were reflected in his later publications. The visitation of plague in 1603 gave rise to <span class="italic">A Storehouse of Comfort for the Afflicted</span>, <span class="italic">The Holy Exercise of Fasting</span> (dedicated to John Jegon, bishop of Norwich), and <span class="italic">Medicines for the Plague</span> (dedicated to Humphrey Tyndall, dean of Ely and master of Queens' College, Cambridge), all of which appeared in 1604. By 30 October 1606 Bownd felt sufficiently confident to issue a second edition of his 1595 treatise, now rendered <span class="italic">Sabbathum veteris et novi testamenti, or, The True Doctrine of the Sabbath</span> (1606), with a dedication to Bishop Jegon, of whose support to a godly preaching ministry in the diocese he expressed his considerable appreciation; it effectively renounced presbyterianism. Perhaps this explains the otherwise puzzling dedication of <span class="italic">A Treatise Ful of Consolation for All that are Afflicted in Minde, or Bodie, or Otherwise</span> (1608) to Sir Henry Warner (<i>d</i>. 1617), who although described by Bownd as a &#145;professor of the Gospel&#146;  (sig. 2), has been seen as hostile to the Bury classis. The co-dedicatee was Warner's wife, Frances, previously widow of Robert Forth (<i>d</i>. 1600); her former husband, whose &#145;zeale to the gospel of Christ&#146; is commended  (sig. 3), seems to have belonged to the same circles as Warner. On the same day, 24 June 1608, Bownd signed the address to Sir Robert Gardiner and his wife, Anne, which prefaced his <span class="italic">The Unbelief of St Thomas the Apostle</span>: this work was first published by the printer to the University of Cambridge in 1608 and again in London in 1628.<br>
<br>In 1611 Bownd became minister of his wife's first husband's church, St Andrew the Apostle, Norwich, but was incumbent for only two years before dying in the city. He was buried there on 26 December 1613. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1627.<br>
