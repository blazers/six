<span class="headword">Carnegie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Scott]</span>,  Susan</span>  (1743&#150;1821), <span class="occ">writer and benefactor</span>, was born on 7 August 1743 in Edinburgh, the daughter of David Scott of Benholm (1700&#150;1768), director and treasurer of the Bank of Scotland, and Mary Brown (1712&#150;1794). She was tutored at home and gained a wide and deep knowledge of French and Italian literature and of philosophy, a proficiency in drawing (which she was taught by a relative Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain), and an interest in social and economic affairs. From her reading of Rousseau's <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span> she learned to challenge the idea that women were intellectually less able than men, choosing instead to explain discrepancies in terms of women's educational opportunities and their general treatment in a patriarchal society. Certainly in her correspondence Susan was fearless in drawing attention to a lack of respect or of rudeness on the part of male writers. Prior to her marriage (contract signed on 17 March 1769) to George Carnegie of Pitarrow (1726&#150;1799), the son of Sir John Carnegie and Mary Burnett, she acknowledged her future husband's right to command her, but hoped &#145;that he never will have [the] occasion or inclination to exercise it&#146;.<br>
<br>As a young woman Carnegie published a number of poems under the pseudonym Juliette North, and took the name Arethusa in her correspondence with James Beattie, the Aberdeen poet and moral philosopher. Carnegie's own interest in moral philosophy led her to the belief that the most important motive for doing good was not to please God but the innate propriety of an action. It was this which proved the foundation of her philanthropic activities in which she was involved while bringing up a family of six sons and three daughters. Following her marriage she moved from the family home at Benholm Castle to Charleton House, Montrose, where she lived for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>In 1779 Carnegie began work with Provost Alexander Christie on the project for which she is now best known: the construction at Montrose of Scotland's first lunatic asylum. Prior to this date the mentally ill had been held at the town's prison with little or no chance of rehabilitation. Carnegie's desire to treat such people humanely and to provide them with the chance of reintegration within the community proved a principal motivation throughout the programme. Having secured the approval of the kirk session of the town council in March 1779, Carnegie engaged in fund-raising through her numerous social connections and from revenue of the estates she received from her husband at their marriage. By March 1781 subscriptions had reached &pound;679 18<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.; building work now began and was completed in budget later that year. Within a decade Carnegie had established the asylum's place as a refuge for patients in and beyond Montrose which was staffed&#151;in what was then a new innovation&#151;by a resident medical superintendent. Carnegie's asylum became a model for similar institutions both in Scotland and in G&ouml;teborg in Sweden (the Sahlgranska sickhouse opened 1782), where her husband worked for the Swedish East India Company during the 1750s.<br>
<br>In addition to her work for the asylum Carnegie was also involved in raising funds for the kirk at Montrose, helped the kirk session to organize local poor relief (for which she wrote <span class="italic">An Appeal to the Inhabitants of the Town and Parish of Montrose</span> in 1803), and assisted many widows, orphans, and bankrupts in the parish. In 1814 she was praised by one local man for &#145;Mr Carnegie's little work on the poor of her parish. I say <i>Mr</i>, for it is <i>une production male</i>&#146;. During the Napoleonic wars she made use of the friendly society and the savings bank in the general organization of poor relief, as well as founding a female friendly society in Montrose.<br>
<br>Carnegie's tolerance of all aspects of her local community was also evident in her religious faith. Originally from an episcopalian family (which converted to presbyterianism following the revolution of 1688) she prayed regularly with her husband, whose own enduring episcopalianism led him to support the Jacobite challenge at Culloden before spending his decade as a merchant in Sweden. Susan Carnegie died on 14 April 1821 at Charleton, and was buried in the family vault at Howff, Charleton. The asylum at Montrose, Carnegie's lasting achievement, was used for this purpose until 1966, when it was sold to the War Office.<br>
