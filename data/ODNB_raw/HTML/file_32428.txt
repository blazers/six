</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clarke,  George Sydenham</span>, Baron Sydenham of Combe  (1848&#150;1933), <span class="occ">defence expert and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 4 July 1848 at the vicarage, Swinderby, Lincolnshire, the eldest of the ten children of Walter John Clarke (1813&#150;1903), the vicar of Swinderby, and his wife, Maria Frances Mayor (<i>d</i>. 1906). Sent to Repton School, Rossall School, and Haileybury College in succession, George seemed an unenthusiastic pupil until his parents noticed his mechanical bent and suggested that he study engineering. After briefly attending Wimbledon House School, he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1866. Two years later, he passed out first and joined the Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>From 1871 Clarke taught geometry at the Royal Indian Engineering College near Staines. He married Caroline Emily Fellowes (<i>d</i>. 1908), the daughter of General Peregrine Henry Fellowes, on 1 June 1871; (Constance) Violet (1878&#150;1909) was their only child. In 1880 Captain Clarke returned to regular service, first in Bermuda, then in Gibraltar. There he met Sir Andrew Clarke (no relation), who sent him to evaluate the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Employed at the War Office as adviser to the inspector-general of fortifications from 1883, Clarke held that earthworks could be as good as fortresses. The Sudan crisis (1885) took him to Suakin for two months on an abortive railway-building mission.<br>
<br>Clarke was secretary (1885&#150;92) of the interdepartmental colonial defence committee, which monitored the military plans of overseas territories. Its proceedings disturbed him: generals and admirals ignored each other and presented contradictory advice. Thus arose his lifelong aspiration to devise a framework of agreed strategic principles into which all component details should fit. The first premise of integrated defence policy was evident: naval supremacy sustained the British empire, which did not need an army capable of fighting a European war. Clarke, a major from 1887, strongly backed the &#145;maritime school&#146; against the &#145;continental school&#146;.<br>
<br>Writing for publication became Clarke's one obsessive pastime. Having started with technical articles and military history, he now addressed all aspects of warfare in his frequent contributions to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and dozens of other periodicals. He expressed far-sighted ideas about submarines and &#145;invisibility&#146; (camouflage) and repeatedly put the case for co-ordinated &#145;imperial defence&#146; (a term which he claimed to have coined).<br>
<br>Clarke served as secretary to the Hartington commission on army and navy administration (1888&#150;90). When politicians shrank from implementing its report, he lambasted the inefficiency and over-centralization of the War Office in the press. Despite his many pseudonyms (Custos, Miles, Navalis, Vetus), insiders recognized his opinions. Clarke found himself peremptorily transferred to humdrum duties in Malta in October 1892. Three months later he received a consolatory knighthood, thanks to his friends in the Admiralty and Colonial Office. Bitter faction-fighting characterized the politics of defence in this period.<br>
<br>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Clarke became superintendent of the royal carriage department at Woolwich in autumn 1894. He relished improving gun mountings but quarrelled ferociously with ordnance factory managers. Dissatisfied with the Dawkins committee on War Office re-organization, on which he sat from 1900 to 1901, he chose to look elsewhere for advancement. In October 1901 Clarke left the army and sailed for Australia as the new governor of Victoria. He was hardly an obvious choice for this largely ornamental post: his domed bald pate, small penetrating eyes, and shaggy drooping moustache created a lugubrious image, and anodyne speechifying was not his forte. Ever conscientious, though, he managed to avoid serious political controversy. The populism of local politicians actually disgusted him. Hitherto a radical himself, he afterwards said that Australia shattered his faith in manhood suffrage. He desperately missed being in London now that Balfour, the new prime minister, was tackling defence deficiencies revealed by the South African War.<br>
<br>Great was Clarke's joy when a telegram recalled him from Melbourne in November 1903 to join the three-man Esher committee on War Office reconstitution. He was so much of a mind with Lord Esher and Admiral Fisher that at first they mistook him for an easy-going fellow. &#145;The Dauntless Three&#146; set out to smash the &#145;old gang&#146; at the War Office. Their brisk report, accepted by Balfour in 1904, recommended abolishing the post of commander-in-chief, creating an army council and a general staff, and providing the emergent committee of imperial defence (CID) with a permanent secretariat. Clarke had been advocating such changes for fifteen years. In May 1904 he became the first ever secretary of the CID, intended to co-ordinate naval and military advice to the cabinet.<br>
<br>Consolidating the CID in the face of departmental jealousies was never going to be easy. Clarke had courage, drive, and expertise, but lacked patience, tolerance, and tact. Men incapable of swift logical argument risked hearing their views discounted as self-serving balderdash. He appeared to see the CID as an embryonic joint defence staff and to hanker after executive authority to impose a systematic maritime strategy (within which the role of the army would be narrowly defined). Senior soldiers generally disdained Clarke as a jumped-up leader writer or naval officer <i>manqu&eacute;</i>. Working closely with Balfour, he yet made some headway towards his goal of a small cheap army, despite being at odds with Arnold-Forster, the war secretary. Government policies on the invasion danger, Indian defence, and the extension of the Anglo-Japanese alliance definitely bore Clarke's imprint. He regretted the replacement of Balfour by Campbell-Bannerman.<br>
<br>The Moroccan crisis of 1905&#150;6 transformed the contest between the army and navy in the CID. Much as Clarke liked the idea of amphibious raids on the German coast, he feared that Fisher's scheme was simply unfeasible. Therefore he acquiesced in the War Office plan to land troops in France in the event of conflict. Clarke saw the British expeditionary force as an <i>ad hoc</i> expedient; Fisher viewed it as a Trojan horse for the continental strategy and effectively withdrew the Admiralty from co-operation with the CID. Clarke was flabbergasted, and these two headstrong navalists were so foolish as to widen their disagreement into a feud. Fisher infuriated the CID secretary by refusing to clarify the navy's war plans. Clarke opposed the construction of dreadnoughts: the technological shift in the naval race would vitiate existing British superiority over Germany in smaller battleships. Meanwhile, the military exploited their chance to edge closer to a continental army. Clarke did not altogether like Haldane's army reforms, but by 1906&#150;7 he was too isolated to exert much influence. Without a supportive premier, his grand ambitions for the CID were going nowhere. Fortunately for Clarke, his anti-alarmist line on Indian security impressed John Morley, the Indian secretary, who in July 1907 selected him as governor of the Bombay presidency.<br>
<br>Clarke arrived in Bombay in October 1907. He formed a low opinion of the government of India&#151;tardy, cumbrous, unimaginative&#151;and bypassed it when possible. Moderate Indian nationalists praised a governor who questioned accepted wisdom; the resident British were disgruntled. Then, in June 1908, under pressure from his officials, Clarke agreed to prosecute B. G. Tilak for advocating terrorism in his newspaper, <span class="italic">Kesari</span>. The trial started a cycle of riots and repression that radicalized Indian nationalism. Morley was appalled; Clarke stood by his decision. Though shaken by the loss of his wife and daughter (to whom he was close) within four months in 1908&#150;9, he did not resign. His zeal for tough policing and censorship embarrassed the Liberal government. Yet no governor was keener to give Indians a meaningful legislative role under the Morley&#150;Minto reforms. He believed in dividing moderates from extremists&#151;until he concluded that the former were hopeless cowards.<br>
<br>Clarke wed his second wife, Phyllis Angelina Rosamond Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1952), widow of Captain Arthur Reynolds of the East Surrey regiment, and youngest daughter of George Morant of Carrickmacross, co. Monaghan, in Bombay on 4 November 1910. He was made Baron Sydenham of Combe (a former family property in Somerset) two months before completing his term of office in April 1913.<br>
<br>Retirement irked Lord Sydenham: he had his cello, his dogs, and his garden at The Priory, Lamberhurst, but why was a man of his ability not viceroy of India or war secretary? A cross-bencher, he addressed the House of Lords about a dozen times a year and, from 1913 to 1916, headed a royal commission on venereal disease. He expected far wider responsibilities in wartime. In the press he scolded British leaders for failing to follow his strategic insights.<br>
<br>From December 1915 to May 1916 Sydenham chaired the Central Appeal Tribunal, administering the <span class="roman">National Service Act</span>. Then the Air Board occupied him until December 1916. At Lord Bryce's second chamber conference (1917&#150;18) he argued for a stronger hereditary House of Lords. The 1918 franchise horrified him, as he now rated democracy a dangerously bad form of government. This belief drove him to lead opposition to the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms: Britain should not inflict democratic institutions upon India. He founded the Indo-British Association in 1917, but with the Conservatives bound to the coalition the India Office could easily ignore him. Sydenham remained a hate figure for Indian nationalists.<br>
<br>Diverse causes enjoyed Sydenham's journalistic support: imperial unity, eugenics, a written constitution, road safety, Montenegro, White Russians, science teaching, the channel tunnel, and the Baconian theory of Shakespeare. He headed the British Empire League from 1915 to 1921 and the British Science Guild from 1917 to 1920. During the war he had decided that the chief internal foes of the empire&#151;socialists, suffragettes, Sinn F&eacute;iners, pacifists, and Indian nationalists&#151;were all, whether or not they knew it, agents of Germany, which controlled them via a network of Jews. Post-war unrest modified this analysis: encouraged by H. H. Beamish and Nesta Webster, he identified German militarism, Bolshevism, Brahmanism, Zionism, and the League of Nations as instruments of a ubiquitous 150-year-old Jewish conspiracy to establish the global dominion of the Antichrist. His task was to infuse diehard conservatives with radical antisemitism. When this failed he campaigned to save Christian youth from the &#145;Jewish&#146; poisons of jazz, modern art, and cinema (while Lady Sydenham ran the British Fascists' children's club). His prophecies of doom ceased only with his death on 7 February 1933 from a cerebral haemorrhage at his London home, 101 Onslow Square, when his peerage became extinct. He was cremated three days later at Golders Green.<br>
<br>George Clarke was a diligent man of independent mind who prided himself on his imagined objectivity. When British supremacy in world affairs was just beginning to crumble, he promptly emerged among the few early, persistent, and constructive proponents of necessary defence reform. His combative personality did not aid the development of the CID after 1904, however, and its failure as a strategic planning body greatly disappointed him. The same tendency to seek an all-embracing synthesis may be seen in both his doctrine of imperial defence and his conspiracy theories of the 1920s, when he was probably the highest-placed right-wing extremist in British public life.<br>
