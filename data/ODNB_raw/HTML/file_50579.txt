<span class="headword">Jones <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cumberbatch]</span>,  Claudia Vera</span>  (1915&#150;1964), <span class="occ">communist and journalist</span>, was born on 21 February 1915 in Trinidad. In 1924 she and her sisters joined their parents, who had emigrated to New York two years earlier. Unhealthy housing and overwork led to Mrs Cumberbatch's death in 1927; Claudia's father, Charles, died in 1958. In 1932 Claudia was hospitalized for a year with tuberculosis. Managing to complete high school despite the increasing ravages of the depression, Claudia worked at a series of unskilled jobs, but sustained what was to become a lifelong interest in drama by joining the drama club of the National Urban League (an African-American organization).<br>
<br>Inspired by the Communist Party's support of African-American struggles, Claudia joined the party in 1936, taking the <i>nom de guerre</i> of Jones. She rose rapidly in the party structure, becoming, for example, chair of its education committee for New York state, a columnist in the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, and eventually editor of the Young Communist League's monthly <span class="italic">Spotlight</span> magazine. By 1945 Jones was &#145;negro affairs&#146; editor on the <span class="italic">Worker</span> and an executive member of the party-affiliated National Negro Council, an organization which campaigned for civil rights.<br>
<br>Being on the second level of the party hierarchy, Claudia Jones suffered from the McCarthyite anti-communist &#145;witch-hunt&#146; which began in 1948. Repeated arrests resulted in a heart attack in 1951. She was imprisoned for twelve months; on her release she was extradited to Britain in December 1955. Very ill on her arrival in London, she was hospitalized for some months. Though initially she received some support from the Communist Party of Great Britain, it never recognized her talents and her organizing and editorial experience. In order to continue her political life she became active outside the party. She began to publish a monthly paper, the <span class="italic">West Indian Gazette</span>, in March 1958 and organized a series of broad-based groups which led the protests after the 1958 race riots in Notting Hill, London, and the lynching of the Antiguan Kelso Cochrane in the same area the following year. In collaboration with other organizations, Jones was a leader of the struggles against the <span class="roman">Immigration Act</span> of 1962. Other campaigns she was involved with included the first moves against the apartheid regime in South Africa; the anti-Vietnam war movement, and the march in support of the 1963 march on Washington for civil rights. In 1959 she also began an annual indoor event to showcase Caribbean talent, which after her death was developed into the Notting Hill carnival.<br>
<br>On being granted a British passport in 1962 Claudia Jones visited the USSR at the invitation of the <span class="italic">Soviet Woman</span>; in the following year she returned for the World Congress of Women. In 1964 she was in Tokyo for the 10th Anti-Hydrogen Bomb Conference and went from there to visit China. This, at the height of the contretemps between the USSR and China, demonstrated her international perspective as well as her commitment to socialism. Throughout a hectic, committed, and financially impoverished life, she suffered repeated hospitalization. Her brief marriage to Abraham Scholnick ended in divorce; there were no children. Claudia Jones died of a heart attack in her sleep on 29 December 1964 at her home, 58 Lisburne Road, Hampstead, aged forty-eight. Her ashes were buried in Highgate cemetery. The <span class="italic">Gazette</span> outlasted her by only two issues.<br>
