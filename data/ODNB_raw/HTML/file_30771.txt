<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Askey,  Arthur Bowden</span>  (1900&#150;1982), <span class="occ">actor and entertainer</span>, was born on 6 June 1900 at 29 Moses Street, Liverpool, the elder child and only son of Samuel Askey (<i>d</i>. 1958), secretary of the firm Sugar Products of Liverpool, and his wife, Betsy Bowden (<i>d</i>. 1949), of Knutsford, Cheshire. Six months after his birth the family moved to 90 Rosslyn Street, Liverpool. Arthur was educated at St Michael's council school (1905&#150;11) and the Liverpool Institute for Boys (1911&#150;16). His social life centred mostly on the church. Apart from Sunday services there were Sunday school, the Band of Hope, the Scripture Union, and choir practice. He started in the choir as a probationer and was paid 3<i>d</i>. a month. Eventually he became head boy. What he later described as his &#145;most memorable performance&#146;  (Hirst, 89) occurred when the lady chapel of Liverpool Cathedral was consecrated and he sang solo to a large, distinguished audience which included the archbishops of Canterbury and York.<br>
<br>As a schoolboy Askey's summer holidays were spent at Rhyl in north Wales. There he regularly watched the performances of a pierrot troupe called the Jovial Jesters, who performed three times a day on a small wooden stage on the sands. Askey was fascinated by this act and would arrive well before each performance and sit on the sands as close to the stage as he could get. Of this troupe &#145;I can honestly say the &#147;Jovial Jesters&#148; gave me the bug for show business,&#146; he later recounted  (Askey, 20).<br>
<br>When he was sixteen Askey went to work at the Liverpool corporation education office at a salary of &pound;10 a month. After the outbreak of war in 1914 he was often asked to sing to wounded soldiers and as well as solos he sometimes sang duets with Tommy Handley, another Liverpudlian destined for show business stardom. In June 1918 he became a private in the Welch regiment. His army career was short-lived because when peace came in November he was demobilized and returned to the education office.<br>
<br>He still retained the desire to build a career in entertainment, especially in a concert party. As often as possible he would cross the Mersey to the Olympian Gardens at Rock Ferry, where touring shows appeared each week. He memorized his favourite items, especially the jokes. Later he spent his summer holidays at Douglas on the Isle of Man, where there were no fewer than four concert parties and he could again add to his repertory of jokes and comic songs. He also entered and won prizes at talent competitions. He started his own amateur concert party called The Filberts and joined another as the pianist.<br>
<br>In 1924 Askey's well-received performances as an amateur finally gained him an offer of his first professional job as a comedian in a concert party called Song Salad. This led to offers of work in pantomimes, the first being <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span> at the Theatre Royal, Torquay, at Christmas 1925, which was followed by many more.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1925 Askey married (Elizabeth) May (<i>d</i>. 1974), daughter of Walter Swash, a publican. They had one daughter. May toured with him in Song Salad for a short time before retiring from performing. In 1926 they moved to London and Askey was introduced to a branch of the entertainment business which was to be his main source of income for the next twelve years&#151;after-dinner entertaining. There were masonic lodges, city companies, staff dinners, Central Hall concerts, and Sunday league shows. The fee was anything from 2 to 5 guineas and sometimes he would appear at as many as three in one night.<br>
<br>In 1938 Askey joined Powis Pinder's Sunshine concert party at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, where he performed successfully for the next eight years. In 1938 the BBC also engaged him for a new radio show called <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span>, in which his partner was Richard Murdoch. The show, first broadcast in January 1938, was an enormous success and its innovative style was perhaps Askey's greatest contribution to the entertainment business. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary was headed &#145;Pioneer of the craft of radio comedy&#146; and he and Murdoch were the &#145;first entertainers to exploit radio as a medium for comedy in its own right&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12). The broadcasts were followed by a tour of music-halls and performances in the London Palladium in 1939. Richard Murdoch then joined the Royal Air Force, bringing <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span> to an end. He was, however, given leave to appear with Askey in four films, <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span>, <span class="italic">Charlie's Big-Hearted Aunt</span>, <span class="italic">The Ghost Train</span>, and <span class="italic">I Thank you</span>.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span> Askey appeared in a number of successful musical shows in London's West End&#151;<span class="italic">The Love Racket</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Follow the Girls</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Kid from Stratford</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Bet your Life</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">The Love Match</span> (1953)&#151;as well as a string of popular radio shows such as <span class="italic">Arthur's Inn</span>, <span class="italic">Hello Playmates</span>, and <span class="italic">Askey Galore</span>. He also appeared in many more films, including <span class="italic">Back Room Boy</span>, <span class="italic">King Arthur was a Gentleman</span>, <span class="italic">Miss London Limited</span>, and <span class="italic">Bees in Paradise</span>, and toured Australia in 1949&#150;50. In 1969 he was appointed OBE and in 1981 CBE. In 1974 he became the first celebrity to have been twice the subject of the television show <span class="italic">This is your Life</span>.<br>
<br>Arthur Askey stood just 5 feet 3 inches and was able to use his lack of height for much humour. He always wore glasses and in his earlier and prime professional days had red hair. He was always smartly dressed except when portraying a character. He was a busy little comedian given to extravagant gestures and darting movements, and was perhaps at his best in a large theatre production such as pantomime and musical comedy.<br>
<br>In later years Askey suffered from generally poor health, and he had a heart attack in 1978. He had both legs amputated in 1982. He died in St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 16 November 1982. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Before your Very Eyes</span>, was published in 1975.<br>
