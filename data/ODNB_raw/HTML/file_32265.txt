<span class="headword">Campbell,  James Henry Mussen</span>, first Baron Glenavy  (1851&#150;1931), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Terenure, Dublin, on 4 April 1851, the youngest son of William Mussen Campbell, a Dublin policeman, and his wife, Delia, daughter of Henry Francis Graham Poole, of Newtown Abbey, co. Kildare. He was educated at Kingstown, co. Dublin, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he won a classical scholarship and was a senior moderator in both classics and history. He won the college historical society's gold medal for oratory and obtained his BA in 1874.<br>
<br>Campbell was called to the Irish bar in 1878 and rapidly became a leading junior on the north-eastern circuit. His skilful oratory won him the praise of distinguished advocates, including T. M. Healy (1855&#150;1931), Edward Carson (1854&#150;1935), and Seymour Bushe. He took silk in 1892 and was made a bencher of King's Inns in 1894. He was called to the English bar by Gray's Inn in 1899, and became a bencher in 1901 and KC in 1906, but did not practise much in England. In 1884 he married Emily MacCullagh (<i>d</i>. 1939), daughter of John MacCullagh, resident magistrate, of Newry, co. Down. They had three sons, the youngest of whom was killed in the First World War, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Like most Irish barristers of the time, Campbell was a politician. He became prominent as a Unionist. Elected to parliament for the St Stephen's Green division of Dublin at a by-election in 1898, he lost this seat to the nationalists in 1900. In 1903, at another by-election, he was returned as one of the two members for Dublin University, Carson having been the other member since 1892. Campbell held this seat until he was raised to the bench in 1916. He was solicitor-general for Ireland from 1901 to 1905 and attorney-general for a short time in December 1905. He was sworn of the Irish privy council in 1905.<br>
<br>During the home rule controversy of 1912&#150;14 Campbell, deeply involved in the Ulster Unionist movement, was a member of Carson's provisional government. He was reappointed attorney-general in April 1916 a few days before the Sinn F&eacute;in rising. In December 1916 he was made lord chief justice of Ireland. He was created a baronet in 1917 and in June 1918 was appointed lord chancellor of Ireland. In the last scramble for office before the setting up of the Irish Free State in 1921 he was induced to retire in favour of Sir John Ross (1853&#150;1935), and was raised to the peerage as Baron Glenavy of Milltown, co. Dublin.<br>
<br>Campbell's experience as potential rebel in the Ulster provisional government and as attorney-general after the rising of 1916 had considerably modified his views on home rule. As head of the Irish judiciary from 1918 to 1921, while the country was in active rebellion, he had come to see that a change was inevitable. Accordingly, when the Irish Free State was established he accepted the new regime and was made a member of its first senate; he was elected chairman in 1922. With his Unionist background, he was an unlikely choice for chairman and his dominance may have stunted the senate's independence. He was even known to adjourn the house to suit his own convenience. W. B. Yeats, a fellow senator, described him as &#145;handsome, watchful, vigorous, dominating, courteous, he seemed like some figure from an historical painting&#146;. In 1928 he did not seek re-election.<br>
<br>Glenavy was a convinced member of the Church of Ireland and served on its synod. He was also a keen golfer and bridge player. He died at his residence, Glenavy, Milltown, co. Dublin, on 22 March 1931, and was succeeded as second baron by his eldest son, Charles Henry Gordon (1885&#150;1963). A portrait by Sir William Orpen was left to Gray's Inn, and another, by Leo Whelan, to Glenavy's son.<br>
