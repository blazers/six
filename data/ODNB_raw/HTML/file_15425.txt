<span class="headword">Kent,  William</span>  (1751&#150;1812), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Henry Kent of Newcastle upon Tyne and Mary (<i>b</i>. before 1734), daughter of William Hunter, shipmaster of Leith, near Edinburgh. His uncle on his mother's side was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14222/', "Vice-Admiral John Hunter")</script>, governor of New South Wales (1795&#150;1800). Kent was educated at home, joined the navy in 1763, and became a lieutenant in 1781. After continuous service in home waters, in 1794 he was appointed to command the <i>Supply</i>. He sailed for New South Wales in February 1795, reaching Sydney on 7 September. In 1791 Kent had married his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70549/', "Eliza Kent (1765/6&#150;1810)")</script>, daughter of William Kent of Newcastle.<br>
<br>After two trips to Norfolk Island with supplies, in September 1796 Kent took the <i>Supply</i> to the Cape of Good Hope to procure livestock, and despite her deplorable condition he successfully completed his mission, returning to Sydney in the following May. In August 1799 he was transferred to the recently arrived <i>Buffalo</i> and in 1799&#150;1800 he repeated the South Africa voyage before taking her to England in October 1800. On his return to Sydney in October 1802 Governor King promoted him acting commander, and the next year Kent took the <i>Buffalo</i> to survey New Caledonia, where he discovered the magnificent Port St Vincent harbour. Sailing on to Calcutta he again procured a large cargo of livestock which he brought back to Sydney in June 1804. In October he took to Port Dalrymple in Van Diemen's Land the party forming a settlement there, and reported on its harbour; the next year he returned to England with confidential dispatches explaining the seizure of two Spanish ships off Peru by Australian vessels. He arrived at Plymouth on 22 December 1805 with birds and plants for Admiral Lord St Vincent and Sir Joseph Banks, and in January 1806 he was promoted captain. From November 1808 he took command of the <i>Agincourt</i> and the <i>Union</i>.<br>
<br>Captain Kent was an outstanding officer; governors John Hunter and Philip King both praised his services highly and both recommended his promotion. In the colony he was appointed to the vice-admiralty court, and as a commissioned officer he served in the criminal court, where he helped both governors against the prejudices and self-interest of Judge-Advocate Richard Dore and the officers of the New South Wales Corps. King appointed him a magistrate in 1802 and the following year to a committee investigating court martial procedure. Privately he was a successful settler. In 1800 he had sold the spacious mansion he had built on his land grant in Sydney to the government for &pound;1539; an additional sale of livestock was valued at &pound;407. Even so, in 1805 he held 1200 acres of land, 350 sheep and a few cattle.<br>
<br>Kent's wife, Eliza, died on 29 January 1810, leaving one son and two daughters; all were born in Sydney between 1799 and 1805, but all followed their father to England. Kent died in the <i>Union</i> off Toulon on 29 August 1812. His son William junior lived in strangely straitened circumstances in Cheltenham until he visited Australia in 1838 to realize his father's property.<br>
