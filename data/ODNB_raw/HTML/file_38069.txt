<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tiltman,  John Hessell</span>  (1894&#150;1982), <span class="occ">cryptanalyst</span>, was born at 70 Torrington Square, Bloomsbury, London, on 25 May 1894, the youngest in the family of one daughter and two sons of Alfred Hessell Tiltman, architect, and his wife, Sarah Ann Jane Kerr. Tiltman was educated at Charterhouse School, where at the age of thirteen he was offered a place at Oxford University which the family was unable to take up. On leaving school, between 1912 and 1914 he taught at three schools, the last of them Northcliffe House School, Bognor. At the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted and was commissioned in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, and from 1915 to 1917 he served in France, where he won the MC and was severely wounded on the Somme.<br>
<br>In August 1920, almost by chance, Tiltman was attached for a year to the small peacetime signal intelligence organization in London; he was then posted to Simla in India, where for eight years he performed cipher-breaking duties with remarkable success. On 7 April 1926 he married Tempe Monica (<i>b</i>. 1898), daughter of Major-General Oliver Robinson of the Army Medical Service. They had one daughter. Having become a War Office civilian in 1925, he was recalled to the colours as a lieutenant-colonel in September 1939 to command no. iv intelligence school. Before that he had helped to earmark dons and outstanding undergraduates for signal intelligence work in the event of war. Many wartime recruits came under his influence through the Bedford training courses, which he organized and supervised. During the 1930s he led the team which successfully decrypted all Comintern radio traffic with England. The texts of this traffic, released in 1997 to the Public Record Office, revealed the dependence of the Communist Party of Great Britain on secret Soviet monetary support; the names and activities of British individuals engaged in this clandestine liaison; and similar dealings between the USSR and the communist parties of several other countries. By 1939 Tiltman was head of the military section at the Government Code and Cypher School. During the course of the war he was promoted colonel and brigadier, and was made chief cryptographer at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.<br>
<br>The unrivalled versatility of &#145;the Brig&#146; was shown by the contributions he made to the solution of a number of machine ciphers during the Second World War. For example, he broke the German railway enigma in February 1941, which revealed in detail German preparations to attack Greece and the USSR. His work was crucial to the initial break into the German enciphered teleprinter systems used for the highest level of German services communications. As a solver of non-machine systems he was pre-eminent, through intuition, experience, and dogged persistence producing answers to problems of the most difficult and complex kind and constantly improving the speed and elegance of the methods used. When faced with a new target country he was able quickly to learn enough of the language to enable him to work on its ciphers. For example, in addition to his varied work on German ciphers during the Second World War, he learned sufficient Japanese to enable him to be the key figure in the decipherment of the main Japanese naval code known as JN&#150;25 soon after its introduction in 1939 and of the Japanese military attach&eacute; code in the summer of 1942. His work on the JN&#150;25 was of value to the Americans after collaboration with them in cryptanalysis began in February 1941. He continued as a civilian in GCHQ after the war and retired at assistant secretary level in 1954.<br>
<br>Tiltman was every inch a soldier but of unassuming modesty. He believed that the success of his work depended upon personal anonymity and public nondisclosure. From his work against Soviet agent and Comintern systems before the war he knew how governmental revelations could nullify success. His wide-ranging contribution to allied security during the Second World War was recognized by the USA with the award of the US Legion of merit in 1946. He was appointed OBE (1930), CBE (1944), and CMG (1954). Tiltman moved to Washington, DC, after his retirement, and was employed as a consultant by the national security agency, where, in 1980, the director, Admiral Bobbie Inman, and deputy director, Ann Caracristi, presented him with a scroll to celebrate 60 years &#145;of distinguished cryptologic service&#146;. He died on 10 August 1982 in Hawaii.<br>
