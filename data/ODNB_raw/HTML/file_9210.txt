<span class="headword">Faunt,  Arthur</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Laurence]</span>  (1553/4&#150;1591), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was the third son of William Faunt of Foston, Leicestershire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of George Vincent of Peckleton, and widow of Nicholas Purefoy of Drayton, in the same county. Both his parents were Roman Catholics. In 1568 he was sent to Merton College, Oxford, where John Pott, a Catholic philosopher who had been expelled from his fellowship in 1563, was allowed to tutor him privately. Under the wardenship of John Man, who had been imposed on the college by Archbishop Parker in 1562, Merton came under the control of the protestant party. In 1569 Pott removed Faunt from Oxford with the consent of his parents and accompanied him to Louvain, where he entered the Society of Jesus in 1570, aged seventeen. After graduating in the humanities at Louvain he proceeded in 1571 to Munich, where he was maintained in his studies by William, duke of Bavaria. From about 1575 onwards Faunt used the name in religion Laurence, and was commonly known as Laurence Arthur Faunt. Having graduated MA at Munich in 1576 he went as a theological student to the English College, Rome, in the same year, and was appointed reader in theology there in 1578. He was ordained at Rome in 1580.<br>
<br>In 1581 Faunt was appointed by the Jesuit father-general, Claudio Acquaviva, to the recently established Jesuit college at Pozna&#324;, Poland, where he taught theology and apologetics at the diocesan seminary, and Greek in the <i>Gymnasium</i>. He was vice-rector of the college from 1585 to 1590. At the time Pozna&#324; became the centre of a campaign by the Jesuits to win back the great Polish magnate families who had converted to protestantism. Faunt, who was regarded as a victim of religious persecution in his own country, played a major part in this counter-offensive. He was prominent in the public debates between the Jesuits and their Calvinist and Lutheran opponents, and published some ten works at Pozna&#324; in defence of Tridentine doctrine. These works included a defence of the Catholic doctrine of the priesthood against the French Calvinist Antonius Sadeel (Antoine de la Roche Chandieu), and a similar defence of the invocation of saints against the Heidelberg Calvinist Daniel Tossanus (Daniel Toussain). At the request of the Polish primate, Stanis&#322;aw Karnkowski, he addressed the provincial synod at Piotrk&oacute;w in 1589 on the causes and remedies of heresy. He also published a treatise in defence of church privileges and tithes against the claims of the secular nobility.<br>
<br>In 1590 Faunt was appointed professor of dogmatic theology at the Jesuit academy in Vilna, Poland, where he died on 28 February 1591.<br>
