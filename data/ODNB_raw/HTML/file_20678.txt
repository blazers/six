<span class="headword">Oldfield,  Henry George</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1785&#150;1805), <span class="occ">antiquary and topographical artist</span>, was the son of John Oldfield (<i>d</i>. 1788), bricklayer and parish clerk of Wingham, Kent; nothing more is known of his background or early life. He was practising as an architect from premises in Scotland Yard, London, in the 1780s, and became architect to Princess Amelia (1710&#150;1786), daughter of George II, who lived at Gunnersbury Park and was ranger of Richmond Park; no documents survive of the work that he carried out for her. His only known work is the rebuilding of the parish church of St Mary in Chatham, Kent, following a fire in 1786. A special vestry committee appointed him to survey the church in February of that year, and in July accepted his estimate of &pound;7000 for the reconstruction, which was completed in 1788.<br>
<br>Oldfield exhibited architectural designs at the Royal Academy, London, in 1787 and 1788 and at the Society of Artists in 1790. He had a keen interest in antiquities and topography and wrote a guide to St Giles's, Camberwell, about 1785. He was co-author, with Richard Randall Dyson (<i>b</i>. 1770), of <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham High Cross</span>, which was published in 1790. Among the subscribers was the antiquary Richard Gough, who subscribed for five copies. A second edition was published in 1792; Oldfield's name was omitted from the title-page, which has led to the incorrect assumption that he had died by this date. In 1791 he wrote <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Archery, Ancient and Modern</span>, which he dedicated to the first marchioness of Salisbury. In January 1793 he was known to be living at Finchley Common, Middlesex, having left Scotland Yard about 1790.<br>
<br>In the 1790s and early 1800s Oldfield made a living by selling his coloured topographical sketches of Hertfordshire. 1500 or more of these, bound in nine volumes, are in Hertfordshire Record Office (Herts. ALS); fewer than ten are dated, and only one bears his signature. He sold his drawings for 4<i>s</i>. each plus expenses, but his sketch of the nave ceiling of St Albans Abbey cost 6 guineas at auction, or 5 guineas by private sale. His sketches of churches are accompanied by descriptions copied from Sir Henry Chauncy's <span class="italic">The Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire</span> (1700). The coloured sketches of buildings generally are simple but those of monuments, achievements, and coats of arms are of superior draughtsmanship and colouring. Oldfield's sketches initially were attributed by J. E. Cussans to John Pridmore (1760&#150;1836), village schoolmaster at Tewin, Hertfordshire, for Pridmore had made copies for Earl Cowper. H. C. Andrews successfully demonstrated that the drawings were by Oldfield and that their original owner was John Meyrick (1753&#150;1805), of Parsons Green, Fulham, who had commissioned Oldfield to record Hertfordshire's antiquities. Meyrick wrote to Oldfield a few months before his own death, on 7 January 1805; Oldfield's drawings were bought by Baron Dimsdale of Essendon, at the auction of Meyrick's library on 21 April 1806.<br>
<br>Oldfield appears to have depended also on the patronage of Richard Gough and Thomas Baskerfield. In a letter to Gough of 2 May 1799 he wrote that he had been arrested for debt and imprisoned in Hertford gaol for the last two months. As he &#145;was wholly out of employ&#146; he offered to make copies of his drawings for Gough; some of his drawings are in the Gough collection in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and in Baskerfield's grangerized copies of Chauncy's and Nathanael Salmon's histories of Hertfordshire in the British Library. Nothing is known of what became of Oldfield after he completed his Hertfordshire drawings, or of when and where he died.<br>
