<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holland,  Philemon</span>  (1552&#150;1637), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born in 1552, probably on 6 November, in Chelmsford, Essex, the son of John Holland (<i>d</i>. 1578), clergyman. He was a member of the same Norfolk family as Sir John Holland, first baronet (1603&#150;1701); this family claimed to be related to the rather grander Hollands of Up Holland, Lancashire, from whom the nineteenth- and twentieth-century viscounts Knutsford were descended, but the connection is questionable.<h2>
<a name="Lifebeforethepublicationofthetranslations15521599"></a>Life before the publication of the translations, 1552&#150;1599</h2>When Philemon Holland was very young his father left England as a protestant exile, returning to be ordained by Edmund Grindal in 1559; he became rector of Dunmow Magna (Great Dunmow), Essex. Philemon attended the nearby Chelmsford grammar school and from about 1568 became a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received the BA in 1571, and was elected to a minor fellowship in 1573 and to a major fellowship in 1574. On 10 February 1579 he married Anne (1555&#150;1627), daughter of William Bott, alias Peyton, of Perry Hall, Handsworth, Staffordshire. His fellowship terminated on his marriage, and he moved to Coventry, about 25 miles from Perry Hall. There he became the usher, or junior of the two full-time masters, at the free school (now King Henry VIII School, Coventry, a position which brought him a salary of &pound;10 a year and a house. He and his wife were famous for their hospitality, and brought up a family of ten children, among whom were the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13514/', "Abraham Holland")</script>, the publisher and miscellaneous writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13523/', "Henry Holland")</script>, and the print publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64982/', "Compton Holland")</script>. In 1585 he was incorporated MA at Oxford. In 1597 he received the degree of MD from Cambridge and began to practise medicine. Like other schoolmaster&#150;physicians of the early modern period, such as Richard Argentine of Ipswich, he was able to combine his double profession with learned work. At some time before 1600 he began translating Livy's history of Rome.<h2>
<a name="Themajorfoliotranslations16001610"></a>The major folio translations, 1600&#150;1610</h2>Holland's first book, the first complete rendering of Livy into English, was published in 1600 when he was nearly fifty. It was a work of great importance, presented in a grand folio volume of 1458 pages, and dedicated to the queen. The translation set out to be lucid and unpretentious, and achieved its aim with marked success. It is accurate, and often lively, and although it does not attempt to imitate the terseness of Latin, it avoids prolixity. As part of his book Holland translated two other substantial works&#151;an ancient epitome of Roman history which provides an outline of the lost books of Livy, and Bartolomeo Marliani's guide to the topography of Rome&#151;as well as some smaller texts. These were taken from the edition of Livy published in Paris in 1573; by translating them, Holland was making available in English a great learned compendium of historical knowledge, not simply a single ancient author. The Livy was followed in the next year by an equally huge translation, of the elder Pliny: <span class="italic">The Historie of the World, Commonly called, the Naturall Historie</span>. This encyclopaedia of ancient knowledge about the natural world had already had a great indirect influence in England, as elsewhere in Europe, but had not been translated into English before, and would not be again for 250 years. Indeed, after four centuries, Holland is still the only translator of this work to attempt to evoke its literary richness and beauty. Two years later Holland turned from Latin to Greek, publishing the first English translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Moralia</span>, a very large collection of miscellaneous essays and lectures which was widely read in the early modern period. This, together with Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span>, had been translated into French by Jacques Amyot in the sixteenth century; whereas Sir Thomas North's English rendering of the <span class="italic">Lives</span> is directly from the French, Holland at least compared Amyot's translation, and a Latin translation, with the original. In all, over the four years 1600&#150;1603, Holland published 4332 folio pages of translations of the very highest quality.<br>
<br>Holland's next translation, undertaken when an outbreak of plague in 1605 confined him to his house and published in the following year, was of a somewhat briefer work, <span class="italic">Historie of Twelve Caesars</span>, from the Latin of Suetonius, whose wealth of minute biographical detail lent itself very well to Holland's talent for conversational liveliness. Like his previous translations it was scholarly as well as vivid, with annotations drawn partly from Isaac Casaubon's edition of 1595. He dedicated it to Anne, Lady Harington, and his epistle to her suggests that he was on visiting terms at her house at Combe, a couple of miles from Coventry, where a former master of the free school, John Tovey, was chaplain and tutor; his son Henry travelled to the Palatinate in Lord Harington's retinue in 1613. In 1609 Holland published his translation of another Roman history, the extant books of Ammianus Marcellinus's history of the empire in the later fourth century, together with a chronology which had appeared in an edition of Ammianus printed in Paris in 1591, dedicating the translation to the corporation of Coventry. In 1610 he completed a translation of William Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, in the course of which he had corresponded with Camden and had also added some material from his own knowledge. This material was reprinted among the footnotes of the 1697 reworking of <span class="italic">Britannia</span>.<h2>
<a name="Subsequenttranslationsoldageanddeath16111637"></a>Subsequent translations, old age, and death, 1611&#150;1637</h2>In 1612 at the age of sixty, Holland was admitted to the freedom of the city of Coventry. Despite his local celebrity he was by no means rich enough to rest on his laurels, and over the next twenty years he kept working, though at a less astonishing rate than he had in his fifties. In 1615 he published a supplement to Thomas Thomas's Latin dictionary of about 6000 previously unrecorded words and meanings, of which many are from Pliny and Ammianus but others show a wide reading in ancient authors such as Apuleius, Prudentius, and Varro, and moderns such as Pomponio Leto and Joseph Scaliger. This was followed the next year by a translation into Latin of John Speed's <span class="italic">The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine</span>, published in London and Amsterdam as <span class="italic">Theatrum imperii Magnae Britanniae</span>. In 1617 Holland translated the medieval medical verse text <span class="italic">Regimen sanitatis Salerni</span>, to be published with a new edition of Thomas Paynell's ninety-year-old translation of the commentary thereon by Arnaldus of Villanova, for a popular market, and when James I visited Coventry in that year Holland made a speech in his honour, which was subsequently printed. A second edition of the <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was entered in the Stationers' register in 1625, but was only published twelve years later. This was not the only piece of work which languished on Holland's desk in these years; he began work on Xenophon's <span class="italic">Cyropaedia</span> during the lifetime of Henry, prince of Wales, but completed the first draft only in 1621, and then continued reworking it for more than a decade.<br>
<br>In or before 1626 Holland fell dangerously ill, and his son Abraham addressed a poem to him in 1626 regretting that his merits have been unrewarded, and particularly that Coventry has been to him a<blockquote>
<div class="indent">lucklesse Cage<br>
</div>
<div>Wherein you have bin cooped all your age<br>
</div>
<div>And spent your golden yeares,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>befriended only by those who wished to exploit him  (Holland, sig. H2<i>v</i>). The following year, his wife, Anne, died. In 1628 he was appointed to the mastership of the school where he had taught for forty years, but he was too old to cope with the job and resigned it within a year; if the story that he taught Richard Allestree, who was born in 1619, is true, he may have returned to the position of usher. He became too infirm to practise as a physician. In 1632 his translation of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Cyropaedia</span> was published at last, together with a reprint of his son Abraham's poem on the battle of Lepanto, in a volume edited by Henry Holland. A treatise on the gout by another son, William (1592&#150;1632), which was published in the following year as &#145;perused by P. H.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gutta podagrica</span>, title-page) may also have been sent to the press by Henry, who also helped correct the second edition of <span class="italic">Britannia</span> for its eventual publication in 1637. In 1633 Philemon contributed a six-line epigram, in Greek, to a Cambridge collection celebrating Ralph Winterton's edition of Hippocrates.<br>
<br>From 1632 to 1636 Holland received an annual pension of &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. from the city of Coventry. In 1635 he was authorized to receive charity from the members of his old university. He became bedridden in the following year and died, in Coventry, on 9 February 1637. He was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Coventry, under an epitaph which he composed in the last year of his life, in which he laments the deaths of six of his sons and describes himself as having entered a second childhood, nursed by his two unmarried daughters. Two years after his death his translation from French into Latin of Brice Bauderon's popular <span class="italic">Pharmacopoea</span> was published by Henry Holland, so that it could be read, as a conservative alternative to the <span class="italic">Pharmacopoea Londinensis</span> of 1618, by learned medical practitioners who did not know French.<br>
<br>Holland's grandson remembered him as a hale old man&#151;&#145;his intellectuals and his senses remained perfect until the eighty fourth year of his age; and more especially his sight so good, that he never used spectacles in all his life&#146;&#151;adding that he was a remarkably moderate drinker, that he was &#145;always of a peaceable and quiet spirit, and hated contention as a serpent&#146;, and that he was &#145;most indefatigable in his study, saying often, that there was no greater burden and enemy to him than idleness&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 234).<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>Holland's translations were widely circulated and read into the eighteenth century. On their account Thomas Fuller included Holland in his <span class="italic">Worthies of England</span>, saying that he was &#145;the translator general in his age, so that those books alone of his turning into English will make a country gentleman a competent library for historians&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 287). Because he was a translator of large and learned works he became a byword for weighty erudition, perhaps especially among persons of limited education: the epigram:<blockquote>
<div>Phil: Holland with translations doth so fill us,<br>
</div>
<div>He will not let Suetonius be Tranquillus<br>
</div> (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 466, fol. 66<i>v</i>)</blockquote>evidently made up by a person proud of knowing Suetonius's cognomen, can be found in printed and manuscript collections. Even Pope made Holland's books, together with those printed by Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde, raw material for the altar erected to dullness in the first book of the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>.<br>
<br>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Holland was remembered not only as a translator but as a penman. The story that he wrote out the whole of his Livy with a single quill pen, which was then preserved as a precious relic by Lady Harington, survives in several versions, and suggests that he wrote with a particularly light and fastidious touch. A manuscript in his hand of the musical treatise ascribed to Euclid called <span class="italic">Harmonic</span> was said to have been one of the models shown to John Baskerville as he designed his Greek types for the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>In the nineteenth century Holland was still a living author. So, for instance, the readers for what became the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> were assiduous in gathering quotations from his works, of which 8095 were printed in the finished dictionary: only seven authors (Shakespeare, Scott, Milton, Wyclif, Chaucer, Caxton, and Dryden) are quoted there more often than Holland. Holland even became the object of sentimentality: &#145;Wherever the pestilence raged, or fever burned&#146;, wrote Charles Whibley in 1899, &#145;there went Holland, bringing with him the comfort of medicine and good counsel&#146;  (Whibley, viii); this overlooks the fact that when the pestilence raged Holland stayed at home and translated Suetonius. By the twentieth century his translations had (with a few minor exceptions such as that of Marliani's <span class="italic">Topographia</span>) been superseded for practical purposes, and very little has been written on him since 1900 except in general surveys. But he is doubly important. His classical translations made some of the major prose works to have survived from antiquity, together with some important recent European scholarly apparatus, available to the growing body of people who could read English fluently but Latin with difficulty if at all, and his translation of <span class="italic">Britannia</span> helped to bring the learned study of the British Isles and their antiquities into the mainstream of English vernacular culture: &#145;In this, through thee,&#146; wrote John Davies of Hereford,<blockquote>
<div>we see (as in a Glasse)<br>
</div>
<div>The wrinckled face of grave ANTIQUITY.<br>
</div> (Davies, 248)</blockquote>
