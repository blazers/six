<span class="headword">Forde,  Florrie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Flora May Augustus Flanagan; <em>married name </em>Flora May Augustus Barnett]</span>  (1876&#150;1940), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was born in Fitzroy, Melbourne, Australia, on 14 August 1876, the daughter of Francis Lott Flanagan, monumental mason, and his wife, Phoebe. She first appeared on stage at a concert at Sydney Polytechnic in 1893, singing &#145;He kissed me when he left me and told me to be brave&#146;. The following year she joined Dan Tracy's Variety Company, appearing as William in <span class="italic">Black-Eyed Susan</span> and Pat in <span class="italic">The Work Girl</span>. In 1895 she appeared in pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, and was at once invited to return the following year. She was to make a long career as principal boy in pantomime; these early appearances attracted the attention of actor and manager C. B. Westmacott, who billed her in his touring company as the Australian Marie Lloyd. Her first British appearance was on the 1897 August bank holiday, when she appeared (as was typical of music-hall artistes at that time) at the London Pavilion, the Oxford, and the South London Palace on the same night.<br>
<br>Like many successful principal boys, Forde was well built, her size a stock joke on the halls: fellow comedian Harry Weldon used to follow her act by stepping gingerly onto the stage and then announcing &#145;If it'll stand Florrie Forde, it'll stand me&#146;. Rather than exploiting a comedy of self-deprecation, however, Forde used her size to convey both glamour and authority. Her costumes glittered with sequins and embroidery, and she made herself even wider and taller with ostrich plumes, capes and trains, and high-heeled shoes. She used the freedom of wearing tights rather than skirts to march about the stage vigorously, and a characteristic prop was a jewelled cane with which she would conduct the audience in the choruses of her songs; her style was that of a benevolent sergeant-major addressing raw recruits. Signed photographs of Forde show a signature full of confident and energetic flourishes.<br>
<br>While memories of Forde herself faded, she lodged her songs firmly in popular memory. &#145;Oh, oh, Antonio&#146;, &#145;Down at the Old Bull and Bush&#146;, and &#145;She's a Lassie from Lancashire&#146;, which featured in the royal command performance of 1912, became staples of any music-hall revival. She reached the height of her fame during the First World War: &#145;It's a long way to Tipperary&#146; was not written for her, but Forde transformed the song of a homesick Irishman into one of the most poignant anthems for British troops. &#145;Goodbye-ee&#146;, &#145;Pack up your troubles&#146;, and &#145;Take me back to dear old Blighty&#146; symbolized the bouncy confidence with which the nation covered its anxieties about the realities of trench warfare.<br>
<br>Forde was one of the few women to launch her own touring revue company, Flo &amp; Co. (which included Chesney Allen), and for thirty-six summers she performed on the Isle of Man, entertaining tourists with &#145;Has anyone here seen Kelly?&#146; and &#145;They're All Single by the Seaside&#146;. Her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist remarked that her bank-holiday d&eacute;but back in 1897 had been prophetic: &#145;If ever there was an artist who seemed to personify the spirit of a holiday crowd, it was she&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 April 1940). Her energy never seemed to flag, and she appeared in the 1935 royal variety show. However, the critic James Agate wrote wistfully that her performance as principal boy in <span class="italic">Ali Baba</span> at the London Lyceum that same year (she was nearly sixty) was perhaps a mistake: she could no longer sustain the illusion of youth, her voice was weakening, and her weight was no longer a sign of her abounding energy. Her celebrated efficiency in marshalling her audience, however, was longer lived, and the affection with which she was regarded by fellow professionals (she was widely known as Aunt Flo) ensured that she was able to take a full part in entertainment activities as the Second World War broke out. Indeed, she seemed to acquire a new following among the younger generation who had missed her prime. She died suddenly on 18 April 1940 at 21 Albyn Place, Aberdeen, where she had gone to entertain wounded soldiers in a military hospital. Her husband, Laurence Barnett (<i>b</i>. 1875/6), a fine art and antique dealer, had died in 1934. Her likeness appears on the sign of the Bull and Bush, Hampstead, which also boasts a Florrie Forde bar. Louis MacNeice wrote an epitaph for Florrie Forde, &#145;Death of an Actress&#146; (<span class="italic">85 Poems</span>, 1959), in which he celebrated her style: ageing, sometimes vulgar, sometimes sentimental, but expressive of a kind of innocence lost to newer forms of popular entertainment:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">she stood<br>
</div>
<div>For an older England, for children toddling<br>
</div>
<div>Hand in hand while the day was bright. Let the wren and robin<br>
</div>
<div>Gently with leaves cover the Babes in the Wood.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
