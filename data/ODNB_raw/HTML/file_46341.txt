<span class="headword">Stone,  Samuel John</span>  (1839&#150;1900), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and hymn writer</span>, was born on 25 April 1839 at the rectory at Whitmore, near Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, the son of the Revd William Stone (1805&#150;1877), author. He was educated at the Charterhouse (1853&#150;8) and Pembroke College, Oxford, becoming boat captain at the latter and graduating BA in 1862 and MA in 1872. He was ordained in 1862 by Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford. It was principally for the poorer congregation of his first curacy in the parish of New Windsor, Berkshire, that he wrote a series of hymns, based on the apostles' creed, entitled <span class="italic">Lyra fidelium</span> (1866), the most famous and enduring of which is &#145;The church's one foundation&#146;. Written at a time of doctrinal controversy in the wake of the Colenso judgment, his primary motivation seems to have been to teach the faith of the church to the poor in a way they would remember.<br>
<br>In 1870 Stone became his father's curate at St Paul's, Haggerston, in east London, and in 1874 succeeded him as vicar. He had a special gift with young people and saw the parish schools as a means of providing good elementary education firmly rooted in the church. He fought vigorously, and successfully, against the establishment of board schools which would have taken children away from St Paul's, and by means of the parish schools, he built up a flourishing body of young people in the congregation. In 1883 he published <span class="italic">Order of the Consecutive Church Service for Children, with Original Hymns</span>. But his ministry was not narrowly confined to young people. As an obituarist stated: &#145;If the world knew him as a sacred poet, east London knew him as a parish priest&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 5 Dec 1900). Mother Kate of St Saviour's Priory, Haggerston, wrote of his pioneering work among the sick poor which evolved into the Hoxton and Haggerston Nursing Institute.<br>
<br>In 1890 Stone became rector of All Hallows, London Wall, a City church much in need of repair. He addressed these material problems but also introduced order and dignity to the worship. He tackled this parish's different pastoral needs inventively. Each morning he opened the church from 6.30 a.m. until 9 a.m. so that young women coming into the City by public transport would have somewhere to go before their workplaces opened. He led the gathering in hymns and prayers at 7.30, and there were often 160 young women present.<br>
<br>In 1899 Stone was diagnosed as being terminally ill with cancer and he spent his last year in rooms in the Charterhouse. He died on 19 November 1900, after much suffering, and was buried on the 23rd near Anerley, London, following his funeral at All Hallows conducted by the bishop of Stepney. A memorial font and tablet in this church were dedicated on 3 November 1901.<br>
<br>Samuel John Stone never married, but he was typical of the parish priest who devoted himself to his work and people. Strikingly handsome and with a full beard, he loved animals. During his time in Haggerston he often took a fishing party to Windsor, and he started a rowing club on the River Lea. Stone combined the vigour of a &#145;muscular Christian&#146; with the oratory of a preacher, the challenge of a campaigner, and the sensitivity of a poet. Mother Kate described him as the &#145;poet of Haggerston&#146;, and while his most famous hymns were written in his youth, he continued to write throughout his life.<br>
