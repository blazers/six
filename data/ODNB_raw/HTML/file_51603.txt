<span class="headword">Davis,  Hewitt</span>  (1804&#150;1884), <span class="occ">farmer and agricultural writer</span>, was born on 16 August 1804 to Isaac Davis and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kennard. He was baptized on 10 November 1804 at St Mildred Poultry, in the City of London.<br>
<br>In his twenties Davis managed the 2000 acre estate of his former employer, a merchant who recognized his ability for sorting out the accounts of the farm bailiff. By 1829 he had moved to Croydon, the address he gave for a letter, written on 1 April 1830, to <span class="italic">The Times</span> about the free importation of corn, later elaborated into a pamphlet, <span class="italic">On Foreign Corn Importation</span>, dedicated to Viscount Milton. On 13 September 1833 he married Maria Husbands, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mennie (1805&#150;1884). They had at least eight children, including a daughter named Ann Marie and a son named Hewitt. He became the land agent for George Smith, and later for his son, George Robert (of the City bankers Smith, Payne, and Smith) of Selsdon Park, south of Croydon, whose Selsdon Farm was a 149 acre chalk hill farm.<br>
<br>Davis's model farm was the nearby Spring Park Farm at Addington, which he tenanted from 1834 to 1849, a 500 acre farm of former heathland, originally known as Coldharbour, which the radical MP John Temple Leader had bought in 1834. Davis farmed 200 acres as arable land, improving it by deep drainage, deep ploughing, and thin sowing, the increased yields of which he discovered accidentally in 1840 when his drill man sowed half the required quantity of seed corn. He farmed the 149 acre Oaks Farm for the see of Canterbury at Shirley, where he also farmed for the second earl of Eldon.<br>
<br>Spring Park Farm attracted many visitors from throughout Britain but few from Surrey. The most publicized visits were those made by the Maidstone Farmers Club. Davis wrote many articles, little more than letters, for the agricultural press and the county newspapers; about eighty were published in three series of &#145;Farming essays&#146; brought out in 1848, 1850, and 1855 and collected in <span class="italic">Practical Essays for the Improvement of Farming</span> (1860). He wrote for tenant farmers, matter-of-fact men like himself. In the late 1830s he was joint managing director, with Dr Augustus Bozzi Granville, of the ill-fated Thames Improvement Company, formed in 1836 to use town manure for agricultural purposes. Davis blamed the City and the commissioners of sewers for its failure.<br>
<br>From 1840 Davis was an inspector of works for the inclosure commissioners, whose sphere of responsibility was much enlarged by the <span class="roman">Public Money and Private Money Drainage Acts</span> passed between 1840 and 1850. He promoted the interests of the Land Improvement Company which facilitated private loans. In 1849 or 1850 he gave up tenant farming to become a partner in Messrs Davis and Vigers, surveyors, of 3 Frederick's Place, Old Jewry, probably because his new career was more profitable.<br>
<br>Davis gave evidence to two select committees of the House of Lords, in 1845 and 1849, about improving entailed estates. His advice to landowners helped to restore the profitability of their estates. His firm acted as surveyors to the Rent Guarantee Society, founded in 1850 to assist landlords manage their estates. His publisher, James Ridgway, was one of its trustees. Davis owned shares in the society.<br>
<br>Davis died at his home, 17 Nottingham Place, Marylebone, on 19 July 1884, his wife predeceasing him early in the same year. They had lived there for the previous twenty years and were buried in Highgate cemetery. He advocated economical and scientific farming at a time where agriculture was threatened by the loss of protection; the <span class="italic">Agricultural Gazette</span> in its obituary praised his clear and simple prose and said that none since William Cobbett and Arthur Young had written more truthful criticism or given sounder advice.<br>
