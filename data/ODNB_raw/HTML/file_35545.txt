</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plumer,  Herbert Charles Onslow</span>, first Viscount Plumer  (1857&#150;1932), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 13 March 1857 at Sussex Place, Kensington, London. He was the younger son and second of four children of Hall Plumer (1827&#150;1888) of Maplas Lodge, Torquay, and his wife, Louisa Alice Hudson (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Henry Turnley, also of Kensington. The Plumers traced their origins indirectly to north Yorkshire landholders: Plumer's great-grandfather was Sir Thomas Plumer (1753&#150;1824), master of the rolls 1818&#150;24, whose brother (another Hall Plumer) had briefly owned the manor of Bilton in Ainsty, north of York.<br>
<br>The most important period of Plumer's military life was his command of 2nd army on the western front for most of the First World War. Plumer kept no diary, published only two short works, and had his papers destroyed before his death. His official biography, <span class="italic">Plumer of Messines</span> (1935), was written by his friend and wartime subordinate General Sir Charles H. (Tim) Harington, chiefly to refute claims that Plumer had disagreed with Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig over the conduct of the third battle of Ypres, portraying Plumer as throughout his career a paragon of loyalty and military propriety. Harington's diary and papers disappeared following the publication of his own memoirs in 1940. Letters from Plumer to his wife quoted by Harington have also disappeared, and he may not have seen the originals. Much of what Harington wrote about Plumer is therefore now unsupported, particularly for the period before 1915 when they first met. Other than a few remaining sources, the version of Plumer left to history is very much the one that he and those closest to him strove to present. While not necessarily false, it cannot be taken as authoritative.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer18631893"></a>Education and early career, 1863&#150;1893</h2>Plumer was educated at Mr King's Preparatory School, Brighton, and Eton College (1870&#150;76), where Charles &Agrave; Court (later Colonel Repington) was an exact contemporary, and Henry Rawlinson and Julian Byng were his juniors. In September 1876 Plumer was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant directly into the 65th foot (renamed the 1st battalion, the York and Lancaster regiment in 1881), and joined the battalion in India the following spring. In 1879 he was appointed adjutant, and in 1882 promoted captain, just before the battalion was posted to Aden. Significant for Plumer's early career was the presence in the battalion of Major George Wolseley, brother of Sir Garnet Wolseley.<br>
<br>Plumer's first active service was in 1884 in the Sudan, when his battalion helped defeat the Mahdists at the battles of al-Teb on 29 February and Tamai on 13 March. Plumer received his only medals for bravery, the Mejidiye (fourth class with clasp) and the khedive's star, together with the first of numerous mentions in dispatches. The battalion then returned to Britain, and on 22 July 1884 at St Andrew's Church, Wells Street, London, Plumer married Annie Constance (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of his father's cousin, the successful merchant George Goss of 5 Devonshire Place (and later 10 Park Crescent), London. An ambitious, snobbish, and sometimes vindictive woman, Plumer's wife played an important but discreet role in promoting his career. Their first child, Eleanor Mary (principal of St Anne's College, Oxford, 1940&#150;53; <i>d</i>. 1967), was born in 1885, followed by Sybil Margaret in 1887, Marjorie Constance in 1889, and their only son, Thomas Hall Rokby Plumer 
    (later second Viscount Plumer; <i>d</i>. 1944)
  , in 1890. An estrangement between Plumer and Thomas, apparently at Lady Plumer's instigation, led to their not meeting or communicating after 1919.<br>
<br>From 1885 to 1887 Plumer attended the army Staff College at Camberley. Like many officers of the period he seemed most concerned with sport, chiefly cricket, which became a lifelong interest. Plumer considered himself financially poor compared both to his fellow officers and to his own aspirations, and occasionally considered leaving the army because of financial constraints. He saw staff appointments as the key to his future, and lobbied hard for them. After regimental duty he was appointed in May 1890 as deputy assistant adjutant-general to the governor of Jersey, on the recommendation of Garnet Wolseley. However he failed to secure a further staff appointment, and on promotion to major joined the 2nd battalion of his regiment in Natal in November 1893.<h2>
<a name="SouthernAfrica18961902"></a>Southern Africa, 1896&#150;1902</h2>After the failed Jameson raid (December 1895 to January 1896), Plumer was sent with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel as special commissioner to Bulawayo, capital of Matabeleland, to disarm the troops of the British South Africa Company, returning successfully to Cape Town in March 1896. Almost immediately, the Matabele (Ndebele) rose in revolt, and Plumer returned to Bulawayo in May, having raised in Mafeking the Matabeleland relief force of about 750 mounted riflemen, together with 200 Zulu and Xhosa infantry. Scouting for Plumer's force was provided by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Baden-Powell. A guerrilla campaign with brutalities on both sides wore down the Matabele, and led to peace negotiations in August between their chiefs and a delegation led by Cecil Rhodes, which has passed into imperial folklore. In December Plumer returned to Britain as a brevet lieutenant-colonel, and at the instigation of General Sir Redvers Buller he was appointed a deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot.<br>
<br>In July 1899 Plumer was sent back to Bulawayo to raise irregular troops in anticipation of war with the Boer republics. The South African War broke out on 9 October, by which time Plumer had raised and was ready to command the Rhodesia regiment of mounted riflemen. Plumer came under the overall command of Baden-Powell, who ordered him both to defend Rhodesia against a possible Boer incursion and to mount diversionary raids into the northern Transvaal. Baden-Powell was cut off and besieged by the Boers at Mafeking on 14 October, leaving Plumer with a largely free hand. By December Plumer had driven the few Boers who came his way back from the Rhodesia&#150;Transvaal frontier, and began to move westward to help relieve Baden-Powell. The siege of Mafeking was not closely maintained, with the Boers often breaking away to skirmish with the various relief columns. In one such skirmish, at Vryburg on 31 March 1900, Plumer was slightly wounded. His force finally linked up with the main relief column under Colonel Bryan Mahon on 15 May, two days before it reached Mafeking and ended the siege. Plumer was promoted brevet colonel and local brigadier-general in August. For a further two years of guerrilla war his role was secondary but successful, securing him a modest reputation as determined and reliable.<h2>
<a name="Britain19021914"></a>Britain, 1902&#150;1914</h2>Plumer returned to Britain in April 1902 to command a brigade at Aldershot. In November he was promoted to major-general, and in August 1903 he was appointed to command part of the Colchester garrison. Having a higher public profile than both his battles and rewards might have suggested, in February 1904 he was advanced to high office as quartermaster-general on the new army council, on the recommendation of the outgoing commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts. Plumer gave enthusiastic support to the plans advanced by the Unionist secretary of state for war, H. O. Arnold-Forster, to restructure the army into virtually two separate branches of long-service and short-service troops. But with the change of government in November 1905 Plumer abruptly left his post and went on half pay. It was believed until his death that he had resigned rather than support the policy of the new Liberal secretary of state for war, R. B. Haldane. But in preparing his biography, Harington was told by Leopold Amery that Haldane had dismissed Plumer after lobbying by other senior officers, including Sir Charles Whittingham (adjutant-general 1904&#150;9).<br>
<br>Historians have speculated about the enemies who ruined Plumer's career and their motives. Most probably, in supporting Arnold-Forster's radical reforms, Plumer had simply identified himself too closely with a policy and a politician unpopular with many military and political power brokers. This incident seems to have been his guiding experience: from then on he took great care to present himself always as loyal both to his military superiors and to the army as an institution. After a year Plumer began to rebuild his career, commanding 5th division at the Curragh in Ireland 1906&#150;9, and being promoted lieutenant-general in 1908. After a further two years on half pay, during which he again considered leaving the army, he took over northern command at York in August 1911.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWar19141918"></a>The First World War, 1914&#150;1918</h2>On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Field Marshal Sir John French, commanding the British expeditionary force (BEF), requested Plumer as commander of his 2nd corps in succession to General Sir James Grierson, who had died on 17 August, but was overruled by Lord Kitchener, secretary of state for war, who sent out General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien. Plumer eventually arrived on the western front in January 1915 to command 5th corps, part of 2nd army under Smith-Dorrien, which was holding the southern sector of the Ypres salient.<br>
<br>Plumer's next advancement came as the result of French's lack of confidence in Smith-Dorrien during the second battle of Ypres, a German attack beginning on 22 April which used poison gas for the first time on a large scale on the western front. On 27 April French ordered Smith-Dorrien to surrender command of all British and imperial troops in the Ypres sector to 5th corps' command, later officially designated as Plumer's Force, and on 6 May he replaced Smith-Dorrien in command of 2nd army with Plumer, who was given the rank of full general. The battle ended on 25 May with the German threat to Ypres itself thwarted. Although Plumer had commanded well, his promotion owed as much to French's feud with Smith-Dorrien, and his own reputation for loyalty and reliability, as to his fighting skill.<br>
<br>For the next two years 2nd army front was used for diversionary operations and training. The marching cry, &#145;Take us back to Daddy Plumer's Army!&#146;  (Powell, 152), often quoted to suggest Plumer's popularity or military ability, could equally well have reflected the troops' desire to be going to a rest sector. In December 1915 the commander of 1st army, Sir Douglas Haig, succeeded French in command of the BEF. Plumer had been discussed as an actual or potential rival to Haig, and on 18 February 1916 Haig confronted Plumer in a private meeting, letting him know that he was on probation. Haig also later noted that he was himself under pressure to remove Plumer from command. This time Plumer survived the test, becoming a model of political support for Haig and army conventionality, although relations between them remained correct rather than cordial.<br>
<br>Plumer's career had not previously been associated with artillery, but with his 2nd army staff he developed a fighting style based on calculated artillery fire plans and limited infantry advances, which was meant to gain ground systematically at the lowest possible loss. Contemporaries spoke of the mathematical calculations which went with this method as the beginnings of a true science of war. Later called the &#145;set piece battle&#146;, it became the prevailing style of the British army during the Second World War. How much of this was due to Plumer himself cannot be determined. One contemporary criticism, going back to Matabeleland, was that his success came from the selection of good subordinates and that he was lost without one. On 13 June 1916 Tim Harington was appointed by Plumer as his major-general general staff (chief staff officer), and supplied whatever was missing in Plumer's personal military abilities. As Brigadier-General John Charteris, Haig's chief intelligence officer, observed in 1917, &#145;No-one knows where Plumer ends and Harington begins&#146;  (J. Charteris, <span class="italic">At GHQ</span>, 1931, 228).<br>
<br>Plumer's first major attack on the western front was the battle of Messines of 7&#150;14 June 1917, from which he later took his title. This was a preliminary operation to secure the Messines Ridge south of Ypres before the main British offensive of the year, the third battle of Ypres (or Passchendaele). It was based on the simultaneous explosion of 450 tons of explosives placed underneath the German positions in twenty-one mineshaft tunnels. The eruption of these mines (two of which failed to detonate) at 3.10 a.m. on 7 June was the loudest man-made sound up to that date, and was clearly audible in London. The battle was effectively won on its first day, with Plumer's forces advancing 3000 yards for comparatively low casualties.<br>
<br>After a disappointing opening to third Ypres, which began on 31 July under General Sir Hubert Gough of 5th army, Haig transferred command of the main battle front to Plumer, whose methodical approach offered a solution to the German defensive tactics. In three separate attacks, on which Plumer's military reputation largely rests, the battles of the Menin Road Ridge (20 September), Polygon Wood (26 September), and Broodseinde (4 October), 2nd army punched a broad hole some 5000 yards deep through the strongest German defences, offering the real hope that further attacks might breach them altogether. But renewed attacks by both 2nd and 5th army in the deteriorating autumn weather and ground conditions failed to deliver either a breakthrough or a German collapse. The immensely controversial and costly third battle of Ypres ended on 10 November.<br>
<br>Already on 7 November Plumer had left with Harington to command the British contingent on the Italian front. Plumer's name was already being canvassed as a possible replacement for either Haig or General Sir William Robertson, the chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Lloyd George offered Plumer Robertson's post after his resignation in February 1918. Plumer declined, but developed a correspondence with the new chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Henry Wilson, which reveals some political sophistication.<br>
<br>After a comparatively uneventful winter in Italy, Plumer returned to command 2nd army at Ypres once more in March 1918. In the crisis of the German spring offensives, Plumer again acted as Haig's trusted subordinate, first thinning out his front to provide reinforcements, then defending the Ypres sector against the &#145;Georgette&#146; offensive of 9&#150;29 April, in the course of which he gave up all the gains of 1917. The defence of Ypres, during which Haig issued his famous &#145;backs to the wall&#146; order, confirmed Plumer's skill in fighting a defensive battle.<br>
<br>Harington left 2nd army on 8 May, after the line was once more stable. Thereafter, 2nd army played only a subsidiary part in the final allied offensives, as part of a larger formation commanded officially by King Albert of Belgium, which began its attacks on 28 September and had liberated Ghent by the war's end.<br>
<br>However much he was bound by army conventionality, Plumer has always stood out from the traditional stereotype of British generals on the western front as incompetent and indifferent to their men's deaths. He appears to have made a genuine effort to plan on the basis of holding his own casualties down, although not at the expense of jeopardizing his own position with his superiors. During the war the main point in his favour was often that he was not someone else. But his reputation as a general seems always to have been high, and since his death it has grown in comparison with other twentieth-century commanders.<h2>
<a name="Postwar19181932"></a>Post-war, 1918&#150;1932</h2>For his war service Plumer received the thanks of parliament and a &pound;30,000 grant. In December 1918 he arrived in Cologne as commander of the British army of occupation, relinquishing the post in April 1919. His next appointment was as governor of Malta, arriving with his wife in June. Next month he received promotion to field marshal and in October was created Baron Plumer. He firmly assuaged discontent, and oversaw the introduction of the first elected legislative assembly for Malta, inaugurated on 1 November 1921 by the prince of Wales. In 1922 during the Chanak crisis he lent significant political support and reinforcements to Harington, who commanded the allied occupation forces in Turkey.<br>
<br>On leaving Malta in May 1924, although ageing and in ill health, Plumer accepted a further appointment as high commissioner to Palestine from August 1925 until July 1928 (including high commissioner for Transjordan in his last year). Although all his appointments had their difficult moments, his political enemies and critics paid tribute to Plumer's way of smoothing things over. He retired from public life in 1928 to 22 Ennismore Gardens, Knightsbridge, London, his permanent address since 1903.<br>
<br>In addition to numerous unofficial and foreign awards, Plumer was made CB and aide-de-camp to the queen in November 1900, KCB in 1905, GCMG in 1916, GCVO and aide-de-camp general to the king in 1917, GCB in 1918, and GBE in 1924. He received honorary doctorates from Cambridge and Oxford. On 24 July 1927 he presided at the ceremony of dedication of the Menin Gate memorial at Ypres to the British missing of the salient. He took particular pleasure in being made president of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1929, the same year that he was raised to the viscountcy as Viscount Plumer of Messines and Bilton.<br>
<br>Plumer gave his own height as 5 feet 9&frac12; inches in 1896, but always appeared shorter to contemporaries, spindly legged, and pot-bellied. His pompous appearance and sometimes petulant behaviour earned him nicknames throughout his life, apart from the inevitable Little Plumer. The Dandy Plumer of his early career gave way to the Daddy Plumer of the First World War, together with Plum, sometimes lengthened to Plum and Apple from the ration jam supplied to the troops. Even Haig, who was only four years his junior, habitually called him &#145;the old man&#146;. From early in his career he affected both a monocle and a bushy moustache, which together with his hair went grey in South Africa, and snowy white by the end of 1917. He has been suggested as the model for David Low's cartoon character Colonel Blimp. Plumer died at his Knightsbridge home on 16 July 1932 and was buried with a state funeral at Westminster Abbey on 20 July.<br>
