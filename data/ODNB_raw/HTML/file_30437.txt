<span class="headword">Ardagh, Sir  John Charles</span>  (1840&#150;1907), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Comragh House, co. Waterford, on 9 August 1840. The second son of William Johnson Ardagh, vicar of Rossmire, of Comragh House and Stradbally, and his wife, Sarah Cobbold of Ipswich, he was educated at the endowed school in Waterford under Dr Price. He had intended to take holy orders when he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1857, but after gaining a prize for Hebrew and honours in mathematics Ardagh decided on a military career, passing first in both the entrance and the final examinations of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 1 April 1859, he completed the usual training at Chatham before superintending the construction of Fort Popton for the defence of Milford Haven. During the Anglo-American crisis over the <i>Trent</i> affair in 1861 he was ordered to embark on the transport <i>Victoria</i> at Queenstown (26 December 1861) with stores to construct a telegraph line through the colony of New Brunswick to the St Lawrence River. The vessel, however, was driven back to Queenstown. On 13 February 1862 it left port again, nearly foundered, and was saved only by the efforts of Ardagh and his sappers. The vessel reached Plymouth on 12 March and Ardagh's conduct was highly praised by the duke of Cambridge, the officer commanding-in-chief of the British army.<br>
<br>Ardagh, who remained at home, was required to build a new fort at Newhaven, for which he invented the equilibrium drawbridge. After employment on the southern defences, he was appointed, in April 1868, as secretary of Sir Frederick Grey's committee to report on the fortifications being constructed under the <span class="roman">Defence Act</span> of 1860. Commended by Grey for his work on this committee, Ardagh accompanied Sir William Jervois on a tour of inspection of the defence works at Halifax and Bermuda. He witnessed the entry of German soldiers into Paris in February 1871 and inspected the defences of the city. After three months in Malta and a year at Chatham he was promoted captain on 3 August 1872, joining the Staff College in February 1873 and passing the final examinations in December 1874. In April 1875 he was attached to the intelligence branch of the War Office, serving in the Netherlands on intelligence duty (10 January &#150; 8 February 1876) and becoming a deputy assistant quartermaster-general for intelligence on 13 July 1876.<br>
<br>In August 1876 Ardagh commenced a tour of duty in the Balkans. Attached as a special service officer to Nisch, the headquarters of the Turkish army operating against Serbia, he was summoned, in October, to Constantinople to report on the defence of the city. In fifteen days he demonstrated his gift for topographical drawing, preparing sketch-surveys of nearly 150 square miles, including the position of Buyk-Chekmedje-Dere, with projects for the defence of the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles, the Bulair lines, and Rodosto. These works were subsequently built by the Turks. Ardagh also reported to the Foreign Office on the operations in Herzegovina and Montenegro, and in December 1876 reported on Tirnovo in Bulgaria. After an attack of fever he recuperated in Egypt and Greece before resuming his duties in the War Office (April 1877), where he completed a survey and report on the sea defences of the Lewes and Laughton levels.<br>
<br>From December 1877 to March 1878 Ardagh served on a Foreign Office assignment in Italy, and in the summer attended the congress of Berlin as the technical military delegate under General Sir Lintorn Simmons. Ardagh's knowledge of the Turkish provinces proved of great value, and in July he was created CB (civil). Between September 1878 and September 1879 he accompanied Colonel Home on the international commission to determine the frontiers of the new principality of Bulgaria. On 30 November 1878 he was promoted a brevet major and was later promoted regimental major (22 September 1880). On 14 June 1881 he was appointed British commissioner for the delimitation of the Turco-Greek frontier, and in spite of local difficulties completed the work by the end of October.<br>
<br>In February 1882 Ardagh was appointed instructor in military history, law, and tactics at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, but on 5 July was sent to Egypt, where he was required initially to oversee the restoration of Alexandria's defences after the British bombardment and to take charge of the intelligence department. On 21 August he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general and was employed on railway administration at Isma&#145;iliyyah. Present at the battle of Tell al-Kebir (13 September 1882), he was mentioned in Lord Wolseley's dispatch at the end of the campaign and was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel (18 November 1882). He also received the British war medal with clasps for Tell al-Kebir, the khedive's bronze star, and the fourth-class order of the Osmanieh.<br>
<br>Ardagh remained in Egypt as deputy assistant adjutant-general to the British army of occupation, and was largely employed in making surveys. In July 1883 he went home on leave, but returned to Egypt almost immediately to assist administratively during an outbreak of cholera. In February 1884 Ardagh, as commanding royal engineer and chief of the intelligence department, accompanied the British force under Sir Gerald Graham, which was sent to the eastern Sudan. He served at the battle of al-Teb (29 February) and at the relief of Tokar (1 March), where he arranged the removal of 700 Egyptian inhabitants. After the change of base to Suakin (8 March), Ardagh completed a reconnaissance of the nearby terrain with mounted infantry, and, after the battle of Tamai (13 March), when the road was opened to Berber, he shared his general's opinion that an advance should have been made to Berber to support Major-General Gordon in Khartoum. As he later wrote, &#145;Berber was then in the hands of an Egyptian garrison, and, had we gone across, the subsequent operations for the attempted relief of Gordon at Khartoum would not have been necessary&#146;  (Malmesbury, 187&#150;8). Graham's force returned to Cairo in April, whereupon Ardagh was mentioned in dispatches on ten occasions and made a CB (military).<br>
<br>When Wolseley launched his relief operation in the autumn Ardagh was appointed commandant of the base at Cairo with the grade of assistant adjutant-general. Although the campaign proved a disaster, for which Ardagh largely blamed &#145;the continued stupid mismanagement of foreign affairs&#146; by the Gladstone government  (Malmesbury, 195), he was promoted to a brevet colonelcy (15 June 1885) and awarded the third-class order of the Mejidiye. On 30 December, as chief staff officer of an Anglo-Egyptian force, he participated in the defeat of an invading Mahdist army at the battle of Giniss, where a bullet passed through his helmet. Ardagh was again mentioned in dispatches, and later promoted to a regimental lieutenant-colonelcy (17 December 1886) and made a colonel on the staff on 26 January 1887.<br>
<br>In 1887 Ardagh returned to the War Office as assistant adjutant-general for defence and mobilization, and he duly devised schemes for overseas mobilization and for home defence. From 1888 to 1895 he was aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge, and in October 1888 became private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, viceroy of India. Save for a period of illness in 1892, he remained with Lord Lansdowne throughout his term of office. After briefly serving his successor, Lord Elgin, he returned to England. He was made a CIE in 1892 and KCIE in 1894.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1895 Ardagh began his appointment as commandant of the School of Military Engineering at Chatham before rejoining the War Office on 27 March 1896 as director of military intelligence, with the temporary rank of major-general. In this post he benefited from his reputation as the army's &#145;foremost politico-military officer&#146;  (Fergusson, 105), enjoying close friendships with senior political and military figures and cordial working relations with the Admiralty, Colonial Office, and Foreign Office. His staff were impressed by their industrious, monocled, and generally taciturn director, who could write &#145;beautifully expressed far-seeing memoranda on the most abstruse questions&#146;  (Gleichen, 176).<br>
<br>Ardagh, promoted major-general on the establishment (14 March 1898), incurred much criticism after the early reverses of the South African War. Yet, in spite of a limited staff and inadequate funds, he had collected, produced, and disseminated military intelligence thoroughly, compiling a full statement on the number and resources of the Boer forces for the government. He had estimated that 40,000 men would be required to defend the British colonies, and that 200,000 men would be required to take the war into the Boer republics. At Ardagh's request, copies of this paper were eventually laid on the tables of both houses of parliament. The intelligence department's secret work, &#145;Military notes on the Dutch republic&#146;, fell into Boer hands after the battle of Talana (20 October 1899) and was published. When the royal commission on the war subsequently reviewed these documents, and other supporting evidence, it described the information as &#145;remarkably accurate&#146;  (&#145;Report&#146;, 128).<br>
<br>In addition to his War Office duties Ardagh was a member of a committee on submarine telegraph cables and, in 1899, military technical adviser to the British delegates, Sir Julian Pauncefote and Sir Henry Howard, at the first Hague peace conference. There he robustly defended Britain's use of dum dum ammunition in warfare against &#145;savages&#146; and participated in drawing up the &#145;Rules respecting the laws and customs of war on land&#146;. In 1900 he was awarded the distinguished service pension.<br>
<br>After leaving the War Office, Ardagh served as the British agent before a commission which was investigating the claims of foreign powers on account of the deportation of their subjects and families to Europe from South Africa during the war. From December 1901 to June 1902 he was in South Africa, settling miscellaneous claims in connection with the war, and later in the year returned to South Africa, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-general, as a member of the royal commission for the revision of martial law sentences. Awarded the queen's medal for the South African War, he retired from military service, at sixty-two years of age, on 9 August 1902. He was still employed by the Foreign Office, succeeding Lord Pauncefote on the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and becoming a British government director of the Suez Canal. In October he served as a member of the British tribunal on the Chile&#150;Argentina boundary arbitration, helping to draft the final award, and in December 1902 was created KCMG.<br>
<br>Ardagh became a member of the council of the British Red Cross Society in 1905, and in June 1906 served as one of four British government delegates at a conference held by the Swiss government to revise the Geneva convention of 1864. The new convention was signed in the following month. In his last public duty Ardagh served as a delegate of the central committee of the society at the eighth international conference in London (June 1907). On his deathbed he received from Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia the Red Cross commemoration medal for his services to the committee during the Russo-Japanese War. Ardagh died on 30 September 1907 at Glynllifon Park, Caernarfon, and was buried at Broomfield church, near Taunton. He was survived by his wife, Susan (1854&#150;1935), widow of James Howard Harris, formerly Hamilton, third earl of Malmesbury, and daughter of John Hamilton of Fyne Court House, Somerset, whom he had married on 18 February 1896. They had no children.<br>
<br>Ardagh served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society, and was an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a member of the Royal Society's geodetic arc committee in 1900. A student of many languages, he was made honorary LLD of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1897 and wrote occasionally for various periodicals, including an article entitled &#145;British rule in Egypt&#146; for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (October 1904). He was a skilful artist, and a collection of nineteen watercolour drawings by him was presented by his widow to the Royal Engineers Institute at Chatham.<br>
