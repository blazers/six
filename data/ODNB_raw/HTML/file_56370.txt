<span class="headword">Jennings,  (Josiah) George</span>  (1810&#150;1882), <span class="occ">sanitary engineer</span>, was born at Eling, Hampshire, on 10 November 1810, the eldest son of Joseph Jennings (1771&#150;1824), plumber, and his wife, Mary Dimmock (1771&#150;1860). He was educated at a school run by an uncle and at the age of fourteen, following the death of his father, he started work with his grandfather, a lead and glass merchant. About three years later he went to serve his uncle, John Jennings, a plumber at Southwick, near Southampton, where he gained considerable practical knowledge of the trade. In 1831 he found employment in London with Messrs Burton, plumbers of Newcastle Street. He was married on 27 August 1836 to Mary Ann Coates Gill (<i>d</i>. 1844), daughter of John Gill, a military contractor. They had four children. Following his wife's death he married, on 1 May 1849, in Twickenham, Sophia (1832&#150;1919), daughter of Henry Budd, builder, with whom he had eleven children.<br>
<br>By 1838 Jennings was in business on his own in Paris Street, Lambeth, funded by a small inheritance from his grandmother, who had carried on her husband's lead and glass business. In 1838 he moved to Great Charlotte Street, Blackfriars Road. His career coincided with a critical period in the development of public health in Britain. From the 1840s the need to provide better drainage, sewerage, and water supply, and adequate sanitary facilities was laid down in local and national legislation and it was to this that Jennings responded with extraordinary energy and inventiveness.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Jennings's occupation was usually given as a plumber and builder, yet one of his first inventions to bring him success was an improved fastener for shop window blinds. But in 1847, describing himself as a brass founder, he took out a patent that covered improvements to the valves of valve water closets and improved methods of making joints and connections between two pipes. The following year he took out a second patent for taps and water closets utilizing a relatively new material, india rubber. He was quick to see that with its natural flexibility rubber had great potential as an effective sealant in plumbing work. His india-rubber tube taps were a success and for these he received his first public award&#151;the medal of the Royal Society of Arts&#151;which was presented to him personally by Prince Albert.<br>
<br>When the preparations for the Great Exhibition of 1851 were under way, Jennings offered to install public conveniences in the Crystal Palace. The exhibition commissioners initially turned him down but then changed their minds. For the superior retiring rooms, Jennings installed his &#145;india-rubber tube&#146; valve closet, but for the second-class facilities he introduced an all-ceramic basin and trap closet of an entirely new design. The basin contained a wide shallow pool of water held behind a weir or lip separate from the water seal in the trap below. By providing two levels of water Jennings created a closet that would immerse solid waste while providing a simple and effective seal from the soil pipe without the use of mechanics. Jennings later claimed to have devised this closet before the exhibition although he only sought patent protection a year after the exhibition in 1852. It went by various names, including the Jennings basin, the monkey closet, and the complete closet, but it was as the wash-out closet that this type of water closet became generally known when other manufacturers launched their own versions from the mid-1870s. The wash-out closet enjoyed considerable success in the 1880s, and although its popularity in Britain waned after 1890 it remained in widespread use in some parts of the world throughout the twentieth century.<br>
<br>A penny was charged for using the retiring rooms at the exhibition (except for the men's urinals, which were free) and when it closed in October 1851 receipts totalled &pound;2441. The principle of paying to use public toilets was established. When the Crystal Palace was removed to Sydenham Jennings eloquently persuaded the commissioners to allow him to continue providing public conveniences. In 1858 he recommended the building of underground public toilets in the City of London but this was rejected, and none were built until 1885, after his death.<br>
<br>Jennings also exhibited some of his inventions in the general hardware section of the Great Exhibition. These included his india-rubber tube cocks, an improved cistern valve, the patent pipe joint, and the patent india-rubber tube water closets as fitted in the superior refreshment courts of the building. His reputation was made and shortly after the start of the Crimean War in 1854 he was called upon by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Sidney Herbert, the secretary of war, to construct the sanitary arrangements for the British hospitals at Varna and Scutari.<br>
<br>Jennings continued to patent important developments of sanitary ware during the 1850s. One of his most successful innovations was the tip-up washbasin, which had appeared by 1851 and was the subject of patent protection in 1860. Quickly and easily emptied by tipping the front rim, tip-up basins were cheap and effective, and were widely used throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Responding to growing concern from water companies over the excessive use of water in flushing water closets, Jennings devised one of the first water closet (WC) cisterns to regulate the consumption of water. Patented in 1852, his cistern used a vertical spindle to hold the ball cock up&#151;thus preventing the admission of fresh water&#151;while the outlet valve to the flush pipe was open. Like all early WC cisterns&#151;or &#145;water waste preventers&#146;&#151;Jennings's version relied on a simple lifting or weighted outlet valve. In 1854 he patented the first syphonic cistern, which used the principle of water displacement to raise the water over the top of a syphon pipe&#151;charging the syphon&#151;which then emptied the tank independently of any further tugging of the chain. This invention ensured that an adequate given quantity of water (usually two gallons) flushed the closet while at the same time preventing uncontrolled waste of mains water. By the 1870s the superiority of syphonic cisterns over valve operated types was clear and their adoption was soon enforced by water authorities.<br>
<br>At the same time Jennings turned his attention to drain pipes, taking out a patent in 1854 for a stoneware drain pipe with an improved connection. But it was &#145;coldly received&#146; by the London stoneware potters and, unable to find anyone prepared to make them, he purchased extensive clay beds at Parkstone, near Poole in Dorset, built a pottery, and about 1856 began their manufacture himself. The patent drain pipes were a success and were followed by the introduction of other stoneware drainage fittings such as bends, junctions, and intercepting traps. He secured government contracts with the War Department and the Admiralty for the supply of his pipes and other drainage equipment in Britain, India, and other British overseas possessions. He supplied all the drain pipes for the main drainage project of Portsmouth and undertook drainage schemes in Vienna, Frankfurt, Warsaw, and Adelaide in South Australia.<br>
<br>As the South Western Pottery, the works expanded to become the second major site of Jennings's business operation. From the 1850s he was in a unique position among sanitary ware manufacturers, controlling the production of goods made both of metals and earthenware. It was several decades before other major sanitary ware manufacturers&#151;notably Doulton and Shanks&#151;combined iron and brass founding with pottery manufacture. While some of his ceramic sanitary ware was made by Twyfords of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and Sharp Brothers of Swadlincote, Derbyshire, it is clear from contemporary advertisements that Jennings made at least some of his own water closet basins and traps at Parkstone.<br>
<br>Jennings built another works close by for the production of bricks and terracotta products, which included air bricks, special bonding bricks, combined smoke and air flues, and facing blocks. Capitalizing on the coastal location of the Parkstone works he constructed a pier and tramway across the mud banks of Poole harbour to facilitate the loading of vessels in deep water and even acquired his own ships to bring in coal and other material to the works.<br>
<br>In 1857 Jennings transferred his London operations to Holland Street, Blackfriars. Moving into the field of hydraulic fittings, he constructed the waterworks for the supply of water to Wilton, Wiltshire, and supplied similar equipment to other towns including Grantham in Lincolnshire. He also returned to the development of the water closet with a patent of 1858 for a twin-basin closet. The secondary basin at the rear or side contained a plunger or piston which was depressed to discharge the waste. When the plug was raised, the flush water was released at the same time, washing the contents of the basin through a connection to the rear chamber and then through the trap. There were few metal parts and the plug cylinder, basin, and trap were made of one piece of earthenware. In 1866 he altered the design of the discharge valve to a hollow piston that acted as an overflow from the basin to the trap. They were widely commended for their simplicity and enjoyed considerable success, and by 1882 some 100,000 had been sold.<br>
<br>Jennings also further explored the potential of goods made of rubber. In 1863 he took out a patent for the moulding of rubber and erected improved machinery for its manufacture. He used it chiefly in the construction of valves but he also introduced an improved form of elastic band and patented rubber seals for fruit jars. He took out patent protection in 1863 for tubes, rings, and coverings of telegraph cables and the following year for a flexible hose. For several years his production of rubber goods was very great, both in London and at a branch factory in Birmingham.<br>
<br>In 1863 Jennings relocated to Palace Wharf, Stangate, Lambeth. These works, however, were largely destroyed by fire in March 1865. Jennings had allowed his insurance to lapse just a few days earlier and suffered considerable financial loss, but undaunted he built new, larger works close by at Palace Wharf facing the houses of parliament across the Thames.<br>
<br>Jennings maintained an association with international exhibitions and trade shows. These included the International Exhibition held in London in 1862 and then in March 1865 the Dublin Exhibition, where he oversaw the installation of sanitary facilities. In 1867 he carried out the sanitary work for the Paris Exhibition, where he was awarded a silver medal, and did the same for the Vienna Exhibition of 1873, which involved the laying of nearly 5 miles of drainage pipes and the installation of more than 600 sanitary appliances. He carried out similar works at Paris in 1875 and at the Centennial Exhibition held at Philadelphia in 1876. He exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878 and then added to his tally of exhibition medals following appearances at Sydney in 1879, Melbourne in 1880, and Adelaide in 1881. He was a member of the Royal Society of Arts and was also a freemason and a member of the Glass Sellers' Company.<br>
<br>Jennings supervised the building of his own home, Ferndale, in Nightingale Lane, near Clapham Common, using materials from the Parkstone works. The house was remarkable for its terracotta ornament. He also developed the Ferndale Road estate at Clapham, building nearly all the houses and then subsequently another six in his own road. He also grew attached to the area around Parkstone, where he acquired a farm and, with his usual energy, went about making improvements that included land drainage and building model farm buildings, cottages, and even a village school. He also bought a property nearby, Castle Eve House, which he used as an occasional summer residence.<br>
<br>Jennings died of bronchitis at Ferndale on 17 April 1882, having fractured his collar bone four days earlier when he was thrown from his gig while crossing the Albert Bridge after his horse reared up causing the vehicle to collide with a large van. He was buried at Norwood cemetery, London, on 23 April. The business was carried on by his sons, who introduced one of the very first pedestal water closets, the &#145;pedestal vase&#146; in 1884 and the &#145;closet of the century&#146;, one of the best-known British syphonic water closets, in 1894. The firm continued in business until 1967.<br>
<br>Although some of Jennings's ideas&#151;for tip-up washbasins, twin basin water closets, and even the wash-out or monkey closet, for example&#151;were overtaken and to some extent even discredited, his innovations in the field of sanitary ware and public health have earned him an enduring reputation as arguably the leading sanitary engineer of his age.<br>
