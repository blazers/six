<span class="headword">Currie,  Raikes</span>  (1801&#150;1881), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born on 15 April 1801, the second son of Isaac Currie (1760&#150;1843), a banker of Bush Hill, Enfield, Middlesex, and his wife, Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of William Raikes, a prominent East India merchant. The Curries were an old Scottish family from Berwickshire. Migrating to London in the mid-eighteenth century, they established themselves as distillers, and it was out of this business that the banking firm was born. The Raikes were also connected with banking and it was the growing professional links and friendship between the two families which brought Currie's parents together. Their marriage in 1789, two years after Mary Anne's brother, Robert Raikes, joined Curries &amp; Co., further improved the prospects of Isaac Currie's banking firm. Mary Anne's uncle, Thomas Raikes, was governor of the Bank of England from 1797 to 1799, and her cousin, George Raikes, followed her brother and joined Curries in 1806, marrying her daughter, Marianne, in 1814.<br>
<br>Currie was educated at Eton College, in preparation for joining his father's bank at 29 Cornhill, London. At the age of eighteen he was greatly influenced by his reading and analysis of John Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>. Believing the study of metaphysics to be of supreme importance, he was particularly impressed with the work of David Hartley, Thomas Brown, Thomas Reid, and Dugald Stewart. From this study, in part, he developed a radical commitment to independence of thought and private judgement, yet believed that life was a &#145;dreary, cheerless thing without the belief of immortality, and an entire trust in an all-wise and all-beneficent Creator&#146;  (<span class="italic">Currie, 1827&#150;1896</span>, 1.195). On 28 June 1825 he married Laura Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of the second Baron Wodehouse of Kimberley, Norfolk; they had four sons and two daughters. In the following year, on the death of George Raikes, Currie became a partner in Curries &amp; Co.<br>
<br>As Isaac Currie actively directed the business, his son devoted substantial time to politics and philanthropy. He established a mechanics' institute, assisted in the formation of a literary and scientific institution, and established and maintained at his own expense a school for the education of eighty children. Currie served as magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Middlesex, and as magistrate for Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hampshire, and Kent. In the wake of the abortive Hungarian revolution of 1848, Currie offered considerable assistance to prominent &eacute;migr&eacute;s, including Lajos Kossuth and Paul Strzelecki.<br>
<br>With the death of his father in 1843, effective management of the bank fell to Raikes Currie, who eventually brought his two eldest sons, George and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39423/', "Bertram Wodehouse Currie")</script>, into the business. Bertram was taken in as partner in 1852, and almost immediately became the guiding force of Curries &amp; Co., allowing his father more time for travelling and parliamentary affairs. In 1864 Curries &amp; Co. merged with Glyn, Mills &amp; Co. to become Glyn, Mills, Currie &amp; Co., moving business to 67 Lombard Street.<br>
<br>In September 1836 Currie accepted an offer to stand as Liberal candidate for Northampton borough on the platform of repeal of the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span>, support for the ballot, strict economy in government, removal of all civil disabilities, abolition of tithes and pluralities, and a &#145;moderate fixed duty on corn &hellip; with a view to a gradual return to the sound principle of free-trade in the great staple of man's subsistence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>, 10 Sept 1836). A committed Benthamite throughout his career, he readily paraded to the electors the &#145;hackneyed phrase&#146; which stood as his guiding political principle&#151;&#145;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&#146;. Surprising most observers, he was elected on 27 July 1837, ahead of the sitting Conservative, and held the seat until March 1857. Though wealthy, he was neither vain of his wealth nor parsimonious. He appealed to &#145;the operative classes&#146; through frankness and a genuine flattery, finding them to be &#145;as a body, beyond all comparison, the most honest politicians&#146;. Currie admitted that the working classes were justifiably suspicious of &#145;all professions&#146; from &#145;pretended friends&#146;, and argued that the progress of the people depended principally upon their circumstances, modified by laws and institutions  (<span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>, 3 Dec 1836).<br>
<br>Energetic, but not ambitious for fame, Currie often worked behind the scenes with friends, including George Grote, Lord Overstone, George Warde Norman, and Charles Buller, to promote an advanced Liberal social agenda, and the economic reforms recommended by philosophic radicalism. In 1837&#150;8 he served on the House of Commons' committee which adopted Rowland Hill's proposal for twopenny postage. He voted in the small minority favouring Charles Villiers's annual motion for the abolition of the corn laws, and for George Grote's annual motion for the adoption of the ballot. During the 1840s Currie became intimately involved in forwarding the various banking and trade reforms which culminated in the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> of 1844 and Sir Robert Peel's repeal of the corn laws in 1846. In 1841 he joined Overstone, Norman, Samuel Gurney, and Lionel Rothschild in supporting Lord John Russell's nomination for the City of London, as the &#145;Minister of Free Commerce&#146;  (O'Brien, 1.26&#150;7). Though an avowed radical, Currie as early as 1841 became convinced that Peel would repeal the corn laws, and deeply regretted the Conservative prime minister's death, exclaiming that he would not &#145;have given him for a whole wilderness of Whigs!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Currie, 1827&#150;1896</span>, 1.382). He supported Peel's financial policy in parliament against his own party.<br>
<br>In 1849, and again in 1857, Currie proposed Lionel Rothschild as parliamentary candidate for the City of London, pleading the cause of civil and religious liberty, and the loyalty of 2000 Jewish voters in the constituency. At the meeting of the parliamentary committee of the Liberal Registration Association on 10 March 1857, Currie himself was suddenly proposed along with Rothschild, in the wake of Lord John Russell's premature announcement that he would not contest the seat at the general election called following the defeat of Palmerston's administration in a parliamentary division on the government's China policy. Russell reconsidered his decision, entered the race without the support of the registration association, and proceeded to come third in the poll, leading to Currie's defeat. Currie then retired from politics, and largely from public life.<br>
<br>Currie had a &#145;happy, easy disposition&#146;, according to his son, and &#145;never allowed the cares of life to depress his spirits&#146;. He took great pleasure in his extended family, and was especially instrumental in promoting the career of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36987/', "John Wodehouse, later first earl of Kimberley")</script>. Largely independent of others for his enjoyment, however, he was seldom disappointed, reading much and amusing himself &#145;with the ordinary pleasures of the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Currie, 1827&#150;1896</span>, 1.57&#150;8). He died at his country residence, Minley Manor, near Farnborough, Hampshire, on 16 October 1881, and was buried five days later. His fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32674/', "Philip Henry Wodehouse Currie")</script>, a diplomat, was created Baron Currie.<br>
