<span class="headword">Holland, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1603&#150;1701), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in October 1603 in Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk, and baptized there the following November, the first son of Sir Thomas Holland (<i>d</i>. 1626) of Quidenham in the same county, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Knyvett of Ashwellthorpe. He matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1620, and went on to enter the Middle Temple in 1623. In 1629 he was created a baronet without fee. On 3 August the following year he married Alathea (<i>d</i>. 1679), widow of William Sandys, fourth Baron Sandys, and daughter of John Panton of Bryncunallt, Denbighshire. The couple had six sons and five daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105823/', "Catherine Holland")</script>, who later converted to Catholicism and entered the English convent, Bruges.<br>
<br>Holland was elected knight of the shire for Norfolk in the spring of 1640, his father having held the seat in 1624. He claimed later that he did not seek re-election for the county in the autumn because he wanted to avoid damaging &#145;sidings and faction&#146;  (Keeler, <span class="italic">Long Parliament</span>, 219). His fears may have arisen in consequence of doubts about the sincerity of his professed protestantism, largely informed by his marriage to a Catholic heiress, and perhaps also by his family's ancient association with the Howard family. He had been agent to the earl of Arundel for a number of years. When the Long Parliament met, Holland sat for Castle Rising in Norfolk, the earl's pocket borough. On 9 November he made a speech in which he decried the extension of the prerogative and the resurgence of the Catholic priesthood, as well as other grievances. However, a fortnight later he was put to publicly disavowing any sympathy for Catholicism on account of his wife's beliefs and practice. Holland sought vigorously for peace from the outset of the civil wars, attempting to arrange a neutrality pact in Norfolk. He came under fire in the Commons for his reluctance to take his share of responsibility for the sequestration of delinquents. He was a commissioner for the treaty at Oxford in 1643. When the talks failed, he withdrew to the Netherlands, where he joined the rest of his family, and did not return to Westminster until December 1645.<br>
<br>A parliamentary commissioner resident with the king at Holdenby in 1647, Holland long continued to believe and fervently to hope that Charles I &#145;was a prince under whose government we may yet be happy&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was out of the country at the time of the purge of the Commons in December 1648 and absented himself from English politics until the readmission of the secluded members in 1660, whereupon he was elected to the council of state. He sought and obtained election to the convention for Castle Rising in 1660, and was considered a friend to the presbyterian interest by Lord Wharton. Returned to the Cavalier Parliament, this time for the Howard seat of Aldeburgh, he spoke against the revival of the temporal authority of episcopacy, and in favour of omitting a clause from the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> condemning the solemn league and covenant. Thereafter he periodically got himself a name as one who consistently opposed court interests, especially when they impinged on the taxpayers of Norfolk. However, he did oppose the bill prohibiting the import of Irish cattle, which would have curtailed one of the principal sources of his own income, derived from the fattening of such cattle for the London market. His opposition to the indulgence of nonconformity also waxed and waned somewhat. But his country sympathies were normally sufficiently to the fore to put Holland on successive ministries' lists of members worth cultivating. He spoke powerfully, and much to the distaste of the court, on the cost of government and the stop of the exchequer in October 1675. In a heavy-handed attempt to warn him off from making such overt criticism, court interests let it be known that William Ashburnham had claimed to remember hearing the same speech delivered by Holland in the Long Parliament. Eventually Holland was silenced by a &pound;200 annual pension awarded to his son for the term of his father's life. &#145;He never addressed the House again&#146;  (Helms and Watson, 559).<br>
<br>In 1679 Holland declined to stand for Norfolk as a country candidate, on account, so it was said, of his wife's ill health; Lady Holland died in May that year. Along with the whig Sir Henry Hobart, Holland unsuccessfully opposed the court candidates for the county seats at the poll in 1685. Among those &#145;closeted&#146; with James II in 1688, he told the duke of Norfolk that if he was elected to the next parliament:<blockquote>he could not (as his present judgment is) be for taking away the Penal Laws and the Tests, nor can contribute to the election of such as should; but he will live friendly with all persuasions as subjects of the same prince, and believes it to be his duty as a good Christian so to do. (Helms and Watson, 560)</blockquote>He subsequently refused to serve on the newly modelled county bench, accepted the Williamite coup, and continued to act as a JP in the early 1690s. He died on 19 January 1701, the last surviving member of the Long Parliament, and was buried at Quidenham. He was survived by three sons and his five daughters.<br>
