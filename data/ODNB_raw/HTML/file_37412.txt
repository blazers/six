<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fenton,  Roger</span>  (1819&#150;1869), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 28 March 1819 at Crimble Hall, near Bury, Lancashire, the third of four brothers and the fourth of the seven children of John Fenton (<i>d</i>. 1863), banker and MP for Rochdale, and his first wife, Elizabeth Aipdaile (<i>d</i>. 1829/30). He attended University College, London, graduating with a BA in 1840, and went on to study law intermittently throughout the 1840s before being called to the bar in 1851. But an inheritance from his wealthy grandfather gave Fenton the financial independence to pursue his ambition to become an artist, and in 1842 he went to Paris to become a pupil of the celebrated history painter Paul Delaroche. On 29 August 1843 he married Grace Elizabeth Maynard, of Harlsey Hall, North Riding of Yorkshire, and together they lived in Paris until 1848. They then returned to London and Fenton continued his studies with Charles Lucy. Little is known of Fenton's accomplishment as an artist other than the mention of three studies shown at the annual exhibition of the Royal Academy between 1848 and 1851. During this same period London's artistic milieu began to recognize the potential of photography as a means of artistic self-expression. Fenton took up the new art about 1852, and during a visit to Russia that year with the engineer Charles Blacker Vignoles he made an extensive series of photographs of Moscow, Kiev, and St Petersburg which first established his name when they were exhibited at venues throughout Britain.<br>
<br>Pivotal to the future of photography was the first exhibition dedicated solely to it. After its opening to the public at the Society of Arts, London, in December 1852, the popular and critical success of this exhibition led a month later to the formation of the Photographic Society of London (later the Royal Photographic Society, 1894). The members' principal aim was to raise the artistic and scientific status of the medium through meetings, publications, and annual exhibitions. Fenton took an active part in organizing both the exhibition and the promotion of the society, becoming its first honorary secretary.<br>
<br>Fenton was not the only artist to take up photography during this period, but his meteoric rise to eminence sets him apart from others. This owed as much to circumstance as to his skill as a photographer. At the first exhibition of the Photographic Society in January 1854 he showed Queen Victoria and Prince Albert round the gallery. The royal family subsequently became important patrons of photography, and by their example the medium was given a status that made it socially acceptable. Fenton was not alone in having portrait photographs commissioned by the royal family, but over the years his professional relationship with them undoubtedly enhanced his status.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Crimean War in March 1854, Fenton undertook the most important commission of his career for Thomas Agnew, a leading printseller and fine art publisher of Manchester and London. Armed with letters of introduction from Prince Albert, Fenton arrived in Balaklava in March 1855, thus becoming the first Briton to enter a seat of war to make an official photographic record. It proved to be the most demanding four months of his life as he struggled to overcome recalcitrant chemistry, difficult circumstances, intense heat, and the imminent threat of death from warfare and disease. Fenton's education as an artist led him to represent the war as a series of heroic portraits, tableaux, and expansive battlefields that implied a nobility of spirit and sense of moral purpose profoundly at odds with the reality of the Crimean campaign. The photographs were published as a series of portfolios by Agnew and exhibited widely throughout Britain during 1855 and 1856, but public interest did not convert into ready sales, so the enterprise failed commercially.<br>
<br>Back in London, Fenton resumed work as the official photographer to the British Museum, an inaugural post which he had held since 1854, and devoted himself once more to the affairs of the Photographic Society. He was elected vice-president in 1857, a position he held until 1861, by which date the predominant culture of photography had shifted away from the original aims and high ideals that characterized the foundation of the society towards the more commercial world of the portrait studio. Despite these cultural shifts, Fenton remained true to his original belief that photography was a medium capable of artistic expression. Each summer he photographed many of the most celebrated beauty spots and noble buildings in Britain with a camera that gave a magisterial format of 14 by 18 inches, which was unusually large even for that period. The bold, imaginative compositions and technical mastery of the studies were regarded as models of perfection by critics, colleagues, and public alike when they were exhibited in cities as diverse as London, Paris, Manchester, Norwich, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. Fenton's policy of submitting new work for exhibition each season allowed him to show more work than any other photographer in Britain and ensured his name was kept before the public.<br>
<br>In an attempt to capitalize on the well-established print market for engravings and lithographs, Fenton collaborated with Paul Pretsch during 1856 to print his work as photo-galvanographic engravings&#151;a complex and tricky process which sought to render the delicate tones of a photograph in printer's ink. Although technically innovative, the process compared unfavourably with the highly finished and sumptuous results possible with steel-engraving and the venture proved not to be commercially successful. However, it is notable as an early attempt to render photographs on a printed page.<br>
<br>During the late 1850s Fenton made a series of studio photographs which were a marked departure from the landscape and topographic studies that had become his hallmark. In 1857 he began an ambitious suite of orientalist studies of exotically costumed pashas, odalisques, and dancing girls whose pose and gesture evoked the heavy sensuality of harem life, a subject matter then much in vogue. In 1860 he made studies of fruit and flowers piled high in superabundant heaps whose exquisitely rendered blooms and soft textured surfaces offered another sort of sensuality due as much to the skill of the horticulturist as to Fenton's skill as a photographer. These studies are quintessentially mid-Victorian, with their heavy opulence and suggestions of self-indulgence. They were among the last group of works Fenton ever exhibited and were rewarded with a prize medal when shown at the International Exhibition, held in London during the summer of 1862. Later that year, without explanation, Fenton gave up photography, selling his cameras and negatives at auction. Quite why he did so, and with such finality, remains the subject of speculation. Perhaps he felt that the future of photography offered little scope for further artistic challenge; the high ideals that had prompted him to take it up in 1852 had been slowly eroded and replaced a decade later by the polished artifice of commercial studio portraiture, and the influence and authority of the Photographic Society were in serious decline. Throughout his brief career as a photographer, Fenton was able fully to explore the potential of the medium as he moved from one genre to another: from portraitist to war photographer; from topographic artist to studio photographer. He was the pre-eminent photographer of the period, and his range and output have rarely been equalled since.<br>
<br>In his later years Fenton resumed his career at the bar. He died at his home in Potters Bar, Middlesex, on 9 August 1869 from nervous exhaustion and pulmonary disorders. He was survived by his wife and by four daughters, a son and daughter having died in infancy. Fenton's work was the subject of a major exhibition at Tate Britain, London, in 2005.<br>
