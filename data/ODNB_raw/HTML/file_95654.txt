<span class="headword">Rudge,  Mary</span>  (1842&#150;1919), <span class="occ">chess player</span>, was born in Leominster, Herefordshire, on 6 February 1842, the youngest child in a family of two sons and five daughters of Henry Rudge (1795/6&#150;1874), a surgeon, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barrett (1801/2&#150;1863).<br>
<br>Mary Rudge learned chess in early childhood and became the first Englishwoman to play the game competitively to a high standard and over a long period. As early as 1864 she and her elder sister Emily Rudge (1838/9&#150;1873), using the pseudonyms of Snowdon and Vesuvius, played in the fourth correspondence chess tournament sponsored by <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Family Newspaper</span>. From 1870 to 1873 they competed in several more such postal competitions; Emily also won a women's tournament at Malvern in 1872.<br>
<br>The break-up of the family home following the death of her father led to Rudge and her unmarried sister Caroline (1833&#150;1900) moving to Bristol, where their brother Henry (1837&#150;1891) was a curate. The Bristol and Clifton Chess Association had decided in 1871 to admit women as members, one of the first chess clubs in the world to do so, and this fortunate coincidence provided the second step in her ladder to chess proficiency. Soon an expert was writing that &#145;It is considered that Miss Rudge has not a superior among the ladies of this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chess Player's Chronicle</span>, Feb 1875, 197).<br>
<br>In the 1870s Rudge played a long series of matches receiving odds from Edmund Thorold (1833&#150;1899) of Bath, a widower whose sister Eliza Mary Thorold (1835/6&#150;1904) was one of her principal rivals. Edmund Thorold was one of England's leading provincial amateurs but, as Rudge increased in proficiency, she was able to defeat most male opponents on level terms. On several occasions she won prizes in tournaments competing with recognized experts, notably in 1878 at Grantham. A cautious player, she employed quiet openings, took few risks, and eschewed the speculative play preferred by most of her amateur contemporaries. She won her games by sound technique, exploiting opponents' errors.<br>
<br>From 1879 the Rudge family ran the Luccombe House preparatory school, Redland, Bristol, but they fell on hard times when it failed in 1885. Henry Rudge moved to Lancashire but Mary and Caroline remained in Bristol, probably living with their widowed sister Sarah Heslop. In 1889 an appeal on Mary Rudge's behalf was published, saying she was in &#145;very depressed pecuniary circumstances&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Chess Magazine</span>, June 1889, 231). This led to a donation of &pound;20 from the Bristol club, whose championship cup she had just won, in recognition of her services to the club in match play. She also received an invitation to visit Dublin, where she stayed between 10 July 1889 and 8 May 1890 as the guest of the chess problem composers and journalists Thomas and Frideswide Rowland (Frideswide was the youngest daughter of Richard Brydges Beechey).<br>
<br>Rudge was one of the strongest players in Ireland at this period and in later years paid further visits to Dublin. In the 1889&#150;90 Armstrong cup (one of the earliest chess leagues in the world) she played second board below the Irish champion, James Porterfield Rynd. She was unbeaten, winning eight games and drawing three, one being against John Howard Parnell, elder brother of the Irish nationalist politician. This excellent performance (fourth best individual result) helped the Clontarf club to win the competition. She also shared second prize in the second correspondence tournament of the <span class="italic">Dublin Evening Mail</span> (1890&#150;93), organized by the Rowlands, defeating the top English amateur, William Gunston, who won first prize.<br>
<br>Rudge next won the ladies' challenge cup in Cambridge, at the 1890 meeting of the Counties Chess Association. For the next few years she abstained from female tournaments, probably because of the gulf in skill between her and the opposition, but continued to enjoy success against men, notably in winning the second-class tournament of the Southern Counties Chess Association in 1896. She also became a member of the Ladies' Chess Club, founded in 1895, but could play little part in its London-based activities.<br>
<br>The peak of Rudge's career was her overwhelming victory in the first ladies' international chess tournament, held in London in the summer of 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. She conceded just one draw against nineteen opponents to win the &pound;60 first prize, donated by the newspaper magnate Sir George Newnes MP, and became acknowledged as lady champion of the world. She explained her success by saying that she cultivated her talent for chess &#145;more by practice over the board than book study; by correspondence games, matches friendly and otherwise&#146;  (Rudge, 27).<br>
<br>Although Rudge was not noted as a chess problemist one of her mate-in-two compositions was published in the <span class="italic">Lady's Pictorial</span> on 4 January 1896. In that genre of the game, another Englishwoman, Edith Elina Helen Baird (1859&#150;1924) (Mrs W. J. Baird, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edith E. H. Winter-Wood), was considered the equal of the top male problem composers, although she rarely competed as a player. Rudge's last known public appearance as a player in England was on 26 November 1898 when she defended stoutly against the world champion, Emanuel Lasker, during his simultaneous display in Bristol. When the game was broken off without result, owing to the lateness of the hour, Lasker did not concede defeat but admitted that Rudge &#145;would probably win if she played the best moves all the time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bristol Mercury</span>, 3 Dec 1898).<br>
<br>At the end of 1899 Rudge was in Ireland again, as resident player during afternoons at the Dublin Bakery Company's restaurants and giving exhibitions in clubs. Arguably she was for a time the world's first female professional chess player, although she was probably paid in hospitality not cash. After 1900 she was rarely heard of, having apparently retired from tournament chess, although occasional correspondence games were published. Money worries and poor health marred her later years, until an appeal, launched by the Gloucestershire Chess Association, appeared in several chess publications in 1912 asking for subscriptions to fund a pension for her. Frideswide Rowland described her as being &#145;quite helpless from rheumatism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cork Weekly News</span>, 17 Feb 1912). Her last reported competitive game was a draw for Gloucestrians against the British Correspondence Chess Association in a 1913 postal match.<br>
<br>In 1915 Rudge was reported to be playing chess with wounded soldiers at the British Home and Hospital for Incurables, Streatham, where she lived. In 1917 her first cousin James Barrett died intestate, leaving an estate worth over &pound;16,000, but her claim to be the sole heir was successfully contested by a male relative of the deceased. Nevertheless, probate records suggest she received a substantial share of this inheritance shortly before she died, in Guy's Hospital, London, on 22 November 1919.<br>
