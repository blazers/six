<span class="headword">Courtauld,  Augustine</span>  (1904&#150;1959), <span class="occ">Arctic explorer</span>, was born on 26 August 1904 at Bocking, Braintree, Essex, the eldest child of Samuel Augustine Courtauld (1865&#150;1953), a director of the family textile firm, and his wife, Edith Anne (Edian) Lister (<i>d</i>. 1951), daughter of Walter Venning Lister. He had one brother and one sister and was a cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32587/', "Samuel Courtauld (1876&#150;1947)")</script>. August, as he was known, was educated at Charterhouse, which he disliked, and Trinity College, Cambridge, which he enjoyed and where he read engineering and geography and from where he graduated BA in 1926. In that year he joined James Wordie's summer expedition to east Greenland as photographer. The party spent the summer surveying the area between Pendulum &Oslash;er and Davy Sund. They also took gravity readings in the area. In the spring of 1927 Courtauld travelled with Francis Rodd and Peter Rodd to the mountains of A&iuml;r in the southern Sahara. The party travelled to Kano, down the Niger to Timbuktu, thence to Dakar, and home in the spring of 1928. Little is known of this expedition as it was not written up by any member of the party.<br>
<br>After an unsuccessful attempt at a career with a firm of City stockbrokers, Courtauld returned to Greenland in the summer of 1929 on another expedition with Wordie. Courtauld was one of the party that reached the summit of Petermann Peak, then the highest known point in the Arctic, but which the party established was only 9300 feet high and not 14,000 feet as had previously been thought. In 1930 Courtauld met H. G. Watkins, who was planning an expedition to Greenland to explore the possibilities of an air route from the United Kingdom to western Canada over the ice cap. Courtauld secured substantial funds from his family for Watkins's British Arctic air route expedition. An essential part of the meteorological programme was the establishment of the ice-cap station some 140 miles north-west of the base camp and 8500 feet above sea level and its maintenance throughout the whole year by two men who would be relieved at approximately monthly intervals by dog sledge or aircraft. As winter approached weather conditions were so severe that a party, including Courtauld, took six weeks to reach the ice-cap station from the base camp and it became clear that it would be many months before it could be relieved again. It was also clear that there was not enough food for two men to be left safely at the camp. Courtauld persuaded the party to allow him to man the station alone and he was left there on 5 December 1930. A relief party reached the vicinity of the station in late March 1931 but in appalling weather conditions they were unable to find it. On the return of the party with this alarming news Watkins, with Frederick Spencer Chapman and another companion, left the base camp and on 5 May located the ice-cap station, though it was completely submerged in snow. Courtauld had spent five months alone, part of the time imprisoned beneath the snow and in darkness. His home was a tent 10 feet in diameter covered by a snow house. He was cheerful and unperturbed. He characteristically wrote of this episode that his main aim had been to &#145;dispel strange ideas of danger and risk in leaving a man in such a situation&#146;, though the main result of his action had in fact been that the meteorological readings which were the scientific goal of the party were maintained uninterrupted at least until April when he ran out of fuel. He later recounted his experiences in a series of articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In 1932 he was awarded the polar medal by George V.<br>
<br>In 1932 Courtauld married Mollie, elder daughter of Frank Douglas Montgomerie, land agent. They had known each other since childhood and together had four sons and two daughters. In the year of his marriage Courtauld bought a 22-ton gaff-rigged yawl which he named <i>Duet</i> and he and his family and friends had much pleasure from it. He was a skilled and fearless seaman. In the summer of 1935 Courtauld organized an expedition with Lawrence (Bill) Wager to Knud Rasmussen Land to map and climb a range of mountains which had been distantly sighted and photographed from an aircraft by Watkins. These proved to be the highest in the Arctic (12,200 feet) and were named the Watkins Range. Before the Second World War Courtauld joined the organization which was to become the Special Operations Executive, and in the summer of 1939 was asked by naval intelligence to take <i>Duet</i> up the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Trondheim gathering as much intelligence as he could. Severe fog tested his skill as a navigator but he brought <i>Duet</i> safely home.<br>
<br>Courtauld served throughout the Second World War in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as sub-lieutenant (1939) and lieutenant (1940&#150;45). He was never promoted beyond the rank of lieutenant as he did not take kindly to rules and regulations. After the war he devoted himself to local government and community service. He served on Essex county council from 1945 to 1955, and became a JP and deputy lieutenant in 1946, and high sheriff of Essex in 1953. He was a governor of Felsted School, chairman of Essex Association of Boys' Clubs, and vice-president of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) (1957), and gave a lifeboat to the institution in memory of his mother. He served three times on the council of the Royal Geographical Society and was honorary secretary between 1948 and 1951. He also served on the committee of management of the Scott Polar Research Institute.<br>
<br>In 1953 Courtauld was found to be suffering from multiple sclerosis and he became increasingly incapacitated, though for a time he was able to attend official and social occasions in his wheelchair. His Christian faith which had brought him comfort during his time in isolation in the Arctic also sustained him through his final illness. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Man the Ropes</span> (1957), shows the signs of his illness, but his anthology of polar writings, <span class="italic">From the Ends of the Earth</span> (1958), is a well-chosen collection. He had little interest in the social advantages which his family wealth might have brought him and characteristically used his money to further exploration and local causes in which he was personally interested. James Wordie described him as a &#145;loveable and popular member of any party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Polar Record</span>, 610). In 1956 he set up the Augustine Courtauld Trust to help causes which &#145;wouldn't get much help otherwise&#146;.<br>
<br>Courtauld died in hospital in London on 3 March 1959. He was buried at sea from the lifeboat which he had given to the RNLI. He was in turn memorialized by a lifeboat given to the RNLI by his brother, Peter, and named <i>Augustine Courtauld</i>. On 21 October 1959 his widow became the second wife of R. A. Butler (later Lord Butler of Saffron Walden). They were married in the presence of their ten children and the marriage was very happy.<br>
