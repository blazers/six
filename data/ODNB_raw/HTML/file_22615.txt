<span class="headword">Potter,  (Philip) Cipriani Hambley</span>  (1792&#150;1871), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born in London on 3 October 1792, the fifth child (and third son) of the seven children of the flautist, violinist, and teacher Richard Huddleston Potter (1755&#150;1821), and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baumgarten (1757&#150;1837); his paternal grandfather was the flute maker Richard Potter (1726&#150;1806). The name Cipriani, by which he was generally known, came from his godmother, said to have been a sister of the artist Giovanni Baptista Cipriani (1727&#150;1785); he was familiarly known as Chip or Little Chip because of his small stature. He was one of the leading composers and pianists of the 1820s and 1830s.<br>
<br>At the age of seven Potter began to study music under his father. He later had lessons from Thomas Attwood and William Crotch, and studied for a five-year period from 1805 with Joseph W&ouml;lfl (1773&#150;1812), his most influential teacher; he may also have had lessons with John Wall Callcott. On attaining his majority in 1813 he became an associate of the recently founded Philharmonic Society, and he was elected to full membership on 29 May 1815. His overture in E minor, a society commission, was performed at the concert of 11 March 1816; seven weeks later, on 29 April 1816, he made his d&eacute;but as a pianist in a performance of his own sextet for piano, flute, and strings, op. 11, another society commission.<br>
<br>At the end of 1817 Potter left England to study composition abroad. His first destination was Vienna, where he met Beethoven, who commented favourably on him in a letter of 5 March 1818 to Ferdinand Ries. At Beethoven's suggestion he studied counterpoint with Aloys F&ouml;rster. After about eight months in Vienna and other Austrian and German cities he moved on to Italy, returning to London in the spring of 1819. He married Emily Caroline Thomson (1802&#150;1867) on 4 October 1822; they had eight children.<br>
<br>In 1820 Potter resumed his involvement with the Philharmonic Society. He played a Mozart concerto on 20 March 1820, and appeared frequently as a soloist at the society's concerts until around 1836, giving the English premi&egrave;res of many Mozart piano concertos and of the first, third, and fourth concertos of Beethoven. Many of his major orchestral works were performed at Philharmonic Concerts, and he also frequently appeared as a conductor.<br>
<br>As a composer, Potter's most active period was between his return to Britain and 1837, when he virtually gave up composition. In 1855, when Wagner conducted his symphony in G minor at a Philharmonic Society concert, Potter struck him merely as a &#145;rather old-fashioned but very amiable composer&#146; with an almost pathetic desire to please  (Wagner, 521). His published works, consisting largely of piano music, give a misleading impression of his output. His most significant compositions are his nine extant symphonies, all unpublished in their original form in his lifetime. These show many effective touches of orchestration and a good deal of counterpoint and imitation. His other works include three overtures on Shakespearian themes; a cantata, <span class="italic">Medora e Corrado</span>, to a libretto by his friend Gabriele Rossetti (1783&#150;1854); some chamber music; and a substantial amount of piano music in a variety of genres. The manuscripts of his unpublished music are mostly in the British Library and the Royal Academy of Music.<br>
<br>Potter was also active as an arranger and editor and as an occasional writer on music. In 1831 he arranged and provided additional accompaniments for a staged production of Handel's <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span> at the Queen's Theatre. As his own creativity as a composer waned, he turned his attention to editing the works of others. His collected edition of Mozart's piano music, which began to appear in 1836, was his most significant achievement in this area; he also prepared editions of keyboard music by Beethoven, Handel, and J. S. Bach. In 1836 and 1837 he contributed articles on Beethoven and the orchestra to early issues of the <span class="italic">Musical World</span>.<br>
<br>Potter is also remembered as an influential teacher and for his long association with the Royal Academy of Music, which he served for thirty-six years from its foundation in 1823. Initially appointed principal piano teacher to the male students, he became director of orchestral practice on the dismissal of Nicholas Charles Bochsa in 1827, and succeeded Crotch as principal on his resignation in 1832. He remained principal until 1859. Among his many pupils were William Sterndale Bennett (1816&#150;1875) and G. A. McFarren (1813&#150;1887), each in his turn later to be principal of the academy. He resigned in 1859, at the age of sixty-six. A man of kindness, ready wit, charm, and modesty, he was respected and loved by colleagues and pupils alike.<br>
<br>Potter spent the remaining years of his life in quiet retirement. On 10 July 1871, less than three months before his death, he participated in the first performance in England of Brahms's <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, at the home of Kate Loder (Lady Thomson), when he and his hostess played the orchestral part in an arrangement for piano duet. Potter was elected a member of the Royal Society of Musicians in 1817. He was a member of the Society of British Musicians from its foundation in 1834 and of the Bach Society from its foundation in 1849; from 1854 to his death he was the musical director of the Madrigal Society. He died on 26 September 1871 at his home, 3 Craven Hill, Hyde Park, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, on 2 October.<br>
