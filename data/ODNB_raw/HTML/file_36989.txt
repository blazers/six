<span class="headword">Barry, Sir  John Wolfe  Wolfe-</span>  (1836&#150;1918), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 7 December 1836 in London, the youngest son, in a family of five sons and two daughters, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1550/', "Sir Charles Barry (1795&#150;1860)")</script>, the architect of the houses of parliament, and his wife, Sarah Rowsell (1798&#150;1882). He assumed the additional surname of Wolfe in 1898.<br>
<br>Educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, and at King's College, London, he then became a pupil of Sir John Hawkshaw, under whom he subsequently acted as assistant resident engineer for the railway bridges and stations at Charing Cross and Cannon Street, London. In 1867 he began a long and distinguished career as a consulting civil engineer. In 1874 he married Rosalind Grace, youngest daughter of the Revd Evan Edward Rowsell, rector of Hambledon, Surrey; they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth Wolfe-Barry and his firm were responsible for numerous engineering projects, especially railways, bridges, and docks. In 1884 he overcame the difficulties associated with linking London's shallow underground railways to form the Circle Line. His other works included the Caledonian Railway's shallow underground lines in Glasgow, and its branch line north of Oban, including the cantilever Connel Bridge across Loch Etive. He was employed on most of the railway bridges crossing the Thames east of Westminster, as well as the King Edward VII road bridge at Kew. Following the death in 1887 of the architect Sir Horace Jones he had sole responsibility for Tower Bridge, completed in 1894. Now an icon of London, its form was determined by the need to provide a low-level road crossing while letting large ships enter the upper Pool of London. He was also occupied with various docks in Britain, each of which was at the then limit of construction techniques, notably the Barry docks and railway; the Alexandra Dock, Newport; Immingham docks; and extensions to Grangemouth docks, Middlesbrough Dock, and the Surrey Commercial docks in London. With Sir Benjamin Baker and A. C. Hurtzig he was engineer for the Royal Edward Dock at Avonmouth.<br>
<br>Wolfe-Barry was also retained as a consulting engineer by many railway and harbour undertakings in India, China, and elsewhere. He was a member of many royal commissions, including that of the Port of London. He was one of the three members of the court of arbitration which in 1902 determined the price to be paid by the Metropolitan Water Board to purchase the eight London water companies. From 1892 to 1906 Wolfe-Barry was one of two British representatives on the international Suez Canal commission. He was specially interested in the problems of town traffic and served on the royal commission on London traffic (1903&#150;5), having expressed his views on the subject in both the inaugural addresses he gave as chairman to the Royal Society of Arts, in 1898 and 1899. He was knighted in 1897.<br>
<br>Wolfe-Barry took great interest in the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he was a member for fifty-four years; he sat on its council for forty years, and was president in 1896&#150;8. His final paper to the institution was &#145;Standardization &hellip; and its influence on the prosperity of the country&#146; (1918). This chronicled his epoch-making initiative in 1901 in founding and championing the Engineering Standards Committee, which later developed into the independent British Standards Institution. He was chairman of the former body from 1905 until his death.<br>
<br>The establishment of industrial standards made mass production possible, and Wolfe-Barry saw that as the adoption of most industrial standards would be voluntary, co-operation was necessary in formulating them. His view was accepted by the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which appointed the main committee in 1901 and supported its subsequent development. Participants in the hierarchical structure of sectional committees, subcommittees, and panel committees included the other principal technical societies, representatives of manufacturing and commerce, and government and other agencies.<br>
<br>The initial advantage of standardization was that it simplified and lowered the cost of manufacturing processes. Early achievements by Wolfe-Barry's committees included reducing the number of patterns of tramway rail from seventy to nine and finding a uniform specification for portland cement which combined the best qualities of the many different specifications previously in use. The principle of standardization has subsequently been extended to a large variety of goods and services. The hierarchical committees, consensus-based decision-making, open participation, and regular reviewing advocated by Wolfe-Barry have been adopted worldwide by voluntary organizations concerned with developing industrial standards, including the International Organization for Standardization.<br>
<br>In addition to his professional achievements his colleagues attached &#145;almost equal importance to the genial atmosphere which Sir John diffused around him&#151;an atmosphere of friendly sociability comparable to the mess-room of a good regiment&#146;  (Strain, 356). He was a fellow of the Royal Society and had many interests and activities outside his professional work, particularly in technical and scientific education. He introduced the requirement of a formal examination test of candidates for membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Wolfe-Barry was chairman of the City and Guilds Institute, and afterwards on the governing body of the Imperial College of Science and Technology. He was a member of the council of King's College, London, and the senate of the University of London. He took a prominent part in the establishment of the National Physical Laboratory, and held a number of civic offices in London.<br>
<br>Wolfe-Barry's wide experience, sound judgement, and untiring energy made him a leading figure in the engineering profession. He died at his home, Delahay House, 15 Chelsea Embankment, London, on 22 January 1918. His wife survived him.<br>
