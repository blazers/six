</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collins,  (William) Wilkie</span>  (1824&#150;1889), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 8 January 1824 at 11 New Cavendish Street, St Marylebone, Middlesex, the elder of the two children of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5959/', "William John Thomas Collins (1788&#150;1847)")</script>, and his wife, Harriet (1790&#150;1868), daughter of Captain Alexander Geddes of Alderbury, near Salisbury. He was of mixed Irish, Scottish, and English descent but lived all his life in or near London, as an adult always in the Marylebone district. He was baptized William Wilkie, for his father and his godfather, the painter Sir David Wilkie, but dropped his first forename after childhood. His unconventional preference for being called Wilkie, rather than Collins or Mr Collins, by his friends&#151;women and children as well as men&#151;was typical of his dislike of formality. He was born with a prominent bulge on the right side of his forehead, and his head and shoulders were disproportionately large for his short body and very small hands and feet. He was short-sighted, clumsy, and unathletic, though otherwise healthy as a child, and he later wore glasses. Clean-shaven as a young man, he later grew a full beard and moustache.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandearlycareer"></a>Childhood and early career</h2>As a child Collins met the poets Coleridge and Wordsworth, as well as many of the painters of the day. His childhood was happy, though he rebelled against the evangelical Christianity imposed by his parents, particularly his father. He admired his father for his hard-working dedication to his art, a trait he shared, but Collins came to dislike his snobbishness and conventionality. He was devoted to his lively mother who, he claimed, first awoke his interest in literature, and he was protective of his less robust younger brother, the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5935/', "Charles Allston Collins (1828&#150;1873)")</script>.<br>
<br>From 1826 to 1830 the family lived in Hampstead. In 1830 they moved to 30 Porchester Terrace, in Bayswater, where Collins remembered seeing, in 1832, the mass demonstrations in Hyde Park in favour of the first <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. He was at first educated by his mother, who had worked as a governess before her marriage. From January 1835 to July 1836 he attended a day school, the Maida Hill Academy. His schooling was interrupted when William Collins took the entire family to France and Italy from September 1836 to August 1838. He later wrote that he had learned more in Italy &#145;among the scenery, the pictures, and the people, than I ever learned at school&#146;  (Morris L. Parrish collection, Princeton University Libraries). He also claimed, in conversations with Charles Dickens and others, to have fallen in love, aged twelve, with a married woman in Rome and to have seduced her. On the family's return to London they moved to 20 Avenue Road, in St John's Wood, and Collins attended a boarding-school at 39 Highbury Place, run by the Revd Henry Cole. Here he felt out of place and was often rebuked for laziness and inattention. But it was at this school that he first discovered his powers of story-telling, to appease the dormitory bully.<br>
<br>Although Collins showed some aptitude for painting, and had a painting hung in the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1849, his gift was less marked than his brother's, and he had no particular inclination for any profession. He was first found employment as a clerk in the Strand offices of a tea merchant, Edward Antrobus, where he remained from 1841 to 1846. Bored by his work, he scribbled compulsively in office hours. His first signed publication was a short story, &#145;The Last Stage Coachman&#146; (<span class="italic">Illuminated Magazine</span>, 1.209&#150;11). He also wrote a lurid novel, <span class="italic">Iolani</span>, set in Tahiti before its discovery by Europeans; it was not published during his lifetime. In 1845 he began a historical novel, <span class="italic">Antonina</span>, set in ancient Rome. His father, impressed by his determination to write, allowed him to leave the firm of Antrobus and enrol as a student of Lincoln's Inn. Although he was called to the bar in 1851, Collins never practised law, but retained a fascination with legal processes that is reflected in his fiction.<h2>
<a name="Firstpublications"></a>First publications</h2>Early visits to France&#151;Paris was to remain one of his favourite cities&#151;confirmed Collins in his dislike of English bourgeois life. He developed a taste for French cooking and for flamboyant and unconventional clothes. His hatred of formality extended to evening dress, and he was known, in later life, to appear at evening engagements in a tweed suit, with a pink or blue striped shirt, and a red tie.<br>
<br>When William Collins died in 1847, leaving his widow and sons in reasonable financial circumstances, Collins suspended work on <span class="italic">Antonina</span> in order to write a life of his father, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., RA</span> (2 vols., 1848), his first published book. At home there was a more relaxed atmosphere. Harriet Collins welcomed her sons' friends to the house and gave informal dinner parties at which smoking was allowed. Amateur performances of plays by Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan were staged in the back drawing-room. Collins also translated a French play, <span class="italic">A Court Duel</span>, which was given a charity performance by the Collins brothers and their friends on 26 February 1850. Two days later <span class="italic">Antonina</span> was published to excellent reviews. Its success was the deciding factor in Collins's determination to make a career as a writer, though he never wrote another historical novel. In the summer of 1850 he wrote a lively travel book, <span class="italic">Rambles beyond Railways</span> (1851), based on a journey through Cornwall on foot with a friend, Henry Brandling, who supplied the illustrations.<br>
<br>In 1851 Collins met Dickens, when he was recruited as an actor in one of Dickens's amateur productions; it was to prove one of the most important relationships of his life. Dickens took the younger writer under his wing, and from 1853 Collins became a regular contributor to Dickens's periodicals <span class="italic">Household Words</span> and <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, in addition to working for other journals, in particular <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> and <span class="italic">The Leader</span>. Collins and Dickens also became close personal friends, as Dickens found Collins's enjoyment of life and disregard for the conventions refreshing. The association was close enough to arouse the jealousy of Dickens's friend and biographer John Forster, and was of great benefit to Collins, especially in his early years as a professional writer, though Dickens was sometimes alarmed at Collins's refusal to conform, either in his life or his writing, to nineteenth-century British prudery. But Collins was not confined exclusively to the Dickens circle: he had many other friends. Through his work for <span class="italic">The Leader</span> he knew G. H. Lewes and George Eliot; he was close to John Everett Millais, who illustrated his story <span class="italic">Mr Wray's Cash Box</span> (1852), and to William Holman Hunt. Charles Reade was a friend in his later years. Nevertheless Dickens's advice and encouragement were vital. He was the first to recognize the originality of <span class="italic">Basil</span> (1852), Collins's first novel of contemporary life, which drew hostile reviews for its outspoken depiction of sexual obsession.<br>
<br>Collins's next novel, <span class="italic">Hide and Seek</span> (1854), was dedicated to Dickens, and is the most Dickensian of his novels. In the early chapters he drew heavily on his own experiences as a child and young man. The novel has a deaf heroine, the first exploration in his work of the effects of physical handicap on perception and character. This, with the altered states of consciousness caused by mental disturbance, became a lifelong preoccupation, and a feature of his fiction. The novel was welcomed enthusiastically by reviewers, who found it more acceptable than <span class="italic">Basil</span>.<h2>
<a name="Healththestageandthenovel"></a>Health, the stage, and the novel</h2>A bout of illness in the summer of 1853 was the first intimation of the serious ill health which was to dog Collins for the rest of his life. By October he was well enough to join Dickens and the painter Augustus Egg for an extensive journey to Switzerland and Italy, described in amusing detail in the letters of both Dickens and Collins. Dickens began to treat Collins less as a disciple and more as a collaborator. Much of their free time was spent together, wandering by night in the less respectable areas of London and Paris, looking for material for their novels and journalism.<br>
<br>Collins's fascination with the stage, encouraged by his association with Dickens's amateur acting company, led him to write his first play, <span class="italic">The Lighthouse</span> (1855), given several performances at Tavistock House, Dickens's home, and professionally produced, with great success, at the Olympic Theatre in 1857. Collins's next book, <span class="italic">After Dark</span> (1856), a collection of his short stories with a framing and linking narrative, consolidated the success of <span class="italic">Hide and Seek</span>.<br>
<br>Collins spent six weeks in Paris in the spring of 1856, living next door to Dickens and his family. He was ill for most of his stay, with a serious attack of the rheumatic disorder described as &#145;rheumatic gout&#146;, which continued to afflict him for the rest of his life. Yet he managed to complete his novella <span class="italic">A Rogue's Life</span> (1879), serialized in <span class="italic">Household Words</span> in 1856, and work out the plot of his next novel, <span class="italic">The Dead Secret</span> (1857). He also visited the theatres and music-halls with Dickens, and he discovered on a bookstall the volumes of records of French trials which provided the basis of the plot of <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span>.<br>
<br>On his return to London, Collins took lodgings near Fitzroy Square, since his mother was about to move house. He wrote a powerful article for <span class="italic">Household Words</span> (13.517&#150;23) on the unpleasantness of his landlady to her exploited maidservants. The plight of the disadvantaged and outcast, particularly if they were women, continued to be a theme of his writing. It was probably at this time that he met Caroline Elizabeth Graves, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Compton (1829&#150;1895), with whom he was to live from January 1859. Mrs Graves (known as Carrie), a widow with a young daughter, Harriet, was keeping a shop in a nearby street.<br>
<br>Caroline Graves was popularly considered to be the inspiration for the principal female character in <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span>, Collins's best-known novel. However, there is no foundation for the sensational story, told by John Guille Millais in his biography of his father (1899), that Collins, his brother, and Millais met a distraught woman in white whom Collins later rescued from a villain who had been holding her captive in a villa in St John's Wood. Caroline Graves's past was perfectly respectable, though she went to some lengths to conceal her humble origins.<br>
<br>In September 1856 Collins became a member of the regular staff of <span class="italic">Household Words</span> and the Christmas number was, for the first time, a collaboration between Dickens and Collins. <span class="italic">The Dead Secret</span> was, at Collins's insistence, serialized under his own name in the magazine. When the volume edition appeared the critic Edmund Yates wrote an article on Collins's fiction, suggesting that it was exceeded only by that of Dickens, Thackeray, and Charlotte Bront&euml;  (<span class="italic">The Train</span>, 3.352&#150;7).<br>
<br>Collins's ambition to succeed in the theatre was still strong and in 1857 he wrote <span class="italic">The Frozen Deep</span> (privately printed, 1857), his best-known play; a production of it was staged that year by Dickens's amateur company to great acclaim. After the original London run, the play was given three performances in the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, where the women's parts were played by professional actresses. It was on this occasion that Dickens, playing the lead, met and fell in love with one of them, the eighteen-year-old Ellen Ternan. The play's success led Collins to experiment further with drama, and a melodrama, <span class="italic">The Red Vial</span>, was given a professional production in 1858. The audience found it absurd, and it was taken off after one night. Collins then returned to journalism, and his many contributions to <span class="italic">Household Words</span> that year included &#145;The unknown public&#146; (18, 1858, 217&#150;22), a plea for better literature for the readers of penny dreadfuls.<h2>
<a name="ComplexrelationswithDickensandTheWomaninWhite"></a>Complex relations with Dickens, and The Woman in White</h2>Collins's relationship with Dickens became more intermittent in 1858, as each was preoccupied with new personal entanglements. Dickens parted from his wife; Collins set up house with Caroline Graves, first at 124 Albany Street, and from the spring of 1859 at 2A New Cavendish Street. Although he never married her, they lived together, with one break of about two years, until Collins's death in 1889, and he treated her daughter Harriet as an adopted child for whom he took complete responsibility. However, although he made no secret of his domestic arrangements, he was still a man of his time. He never attempted to make Caroline Graves a part of his social life, and although she was introduced to his circle of male friends, she never met their wives or stayed in their houses, where Collins appeared as a bachelor.<br>
<br>A further collection of short stories, <span class="italic">The Queen of Hearts</span> (1859), was followed by Collins's greatest success, <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> (1860). It began serialization in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> in November 1859, and by Christmas it was the talk of London. Collins thoroughly enjoyed the fame and fortune it brought him. He moved with Caroline Graves to rooms at 12 Harley Street, spending a considerable amount on redecoration and refurbishment, and employing two servants. He entertained generously, in a typically informal way, and indulged the appreciation of rich food and fine wines which was to contribute to the undermining of his health. His success was at its peak during the 1860s, when his four best-known novels, <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span>, <span class="italic">No Name</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Armadale</span> (1866), and <span class="italic">The Moonstone</span> (1868), were published. The term &#145;sensation novel&#146; was coined by reviewers to describe them, and Collins was seen as the originator of this highly popular genre.<br>
<br>The marriage of his brother, Charles Collins, to Dickens's daughter Kate in 1860 increased the detachment of Dickens from Collins. Dickens disapproved of the marriage, and also of Collins's open liaison with Caroline Graves. Collins, now financially secure but increasingly unwell, resigned from the staff of <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> to concentrate on writing <span class="italic">No Name</span>. As he was struggling to finish the novel he was alarmed by the development of new symptoms added to his now familiar &#145;rheumatic gout&#146;, caused by the laudanum prescribed by his doctor to ease the pain of his illness. Although he made several attempts to do without the drug he was to remain dependent on ever-increasing doses of laudanum for the rest of his life, eventually taking amounts large enough to kill anyone not habituated to opiates.<br>
<br>Collins was given the considerable sum of &pound;5000 for <span class="italic">Armadale</span> by the publisher George Smith. However, the serialization in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> had to be postponed because of the increasing severity of his illness. He travelled widely with Caroline Graves while planning the book, visiting the spa towns of Aix-la-Chapelle and Wildbad and spending the winter of 1863&#150;4 in Rome, where he celebrated his fortieth birthday. Although physically ageing, he wrote to his mother that he still had &#145;no regular habits, no respectable prejudices &hellip; none of the melancholy sobrieties of sentiment &hellip; which are supposed to be proper to middle-age&#146;  (Pierpont Morgan Library, MA 3150 80).<h2>
<a name="Acomplicatedpersonallife"></a>A complicated personal life</h2>A sailing holiday in Norfolk in August 1864 seems to have proved his point, for it was probably then that Collins met Martha Rudd (1845&#150;1919); a Norfolk shepherd's daughter then working as a servant in the Great Yarmouth area, she was to become the mother of his three children. However, there is no definite record of their relationship until 1868. In 1867 Collins and Caroline Graves moved to 90 Gloucester Place, where he lived for over twenty years. In the same year he became the temporary editor of <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> while Dickens was in the United States, and wrote, in collaboration with him, the play <span class="italic">No Thoroughfare</span> (privately printed, 1867), which was his first commercial success in the theatre.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Moonstone</span> has remained second only to <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> in popularity among Collins's novels. Although not the first detective story, it is a classic of the genre, with many features repeatedly borrowed by later writers such as Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and Dorothy L. Sayers. Collins's accomplishment was remarkable, for the novel was written while he was under great stress. His mother, ill from the beginning of 1868, died in March. Collins, suffering the worst attack of illness he had ever had to endure, called her death the bitterest affliction of his life. He was too ill to attend her funeral, and for the first time dictated a short section of his novel to Harriet Graves, later to become his regular amanuensis. His suffering, and the effects of the laudanum which relieved it, are reflected in the experiences of the character Ezra Jennings in <span class="italic">The Moonstone</span>.<br>
<br>Collins's personal life was also in turmoil. Probably in response to his affair with Martha Rudd, Caroline Graves married Joseph Clow, a vintner's son eleven years her junior, in October 1868. Dickens believed that the marriage was the result of her failed attempt to force marriage on Collins. Collins was present at the wedding, and Harriet Graves continued to live with him, taking over the running of his household. Martha Rudd, under the name of Mrs Martha Dawson, was now installed in lodgings within walking distance of Collins's house, Collins adopting the alias of William Dawson whenever he visited her or stayed with her in lodgings at Ramsgate, Kent. Their first child, Marian, was born on 4 July 1869, and their second, Constance Harriet, on 14 May 1871. Their only son, William Charles Collins Dawson, was born on Christmas day 1874.<br>
<br>In spite of Collins's commitment to Martha, Caroline Graves abandoned her marriage to Clow and resumed her former name after about two years, returning to live with Collins. His failure to marry either woman was probably a reflection of his sense of responsibility to both. His will treated them equally, and Harriet Graves was given the same consideration as his own children. It is unlikely that Caroline and Martha ever met, but Martha's children often went to stay at Gloucester Place, and with Collins and Caroline Graves at Ramsgate.<h2>
<a name="Laterwritingsillhealthanddecline"></a>Later writings, ill health, and decline</h2>During the 1870s Collins's attempts to establish himself as a playwright met with increased success. A dramatization of <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> was staged in 1871, and he now planned a number of his novels with stage adaptation in mind from their inception. <span class="italic">Man and Wife</span> (1870), in which he attacked the state of the marriage laws and the cult of athleticism, was first conceived as a play and staged very successfully in 1873. Although <span class="italic">Poor Miss Finch</span> (1872) was not dramatized, <span class="italic">The New Magdalen</span> (1873), a plea for sympathy for &#145;fallen women&#146;, was equally successful as a novel and a play. Dramatizations of <span class="italic">Armadale</span> (entitled <span class="italic">Miss Gwilt</span>) and <span class="italic">The Moonstone</span> followed in 1876 and 1877. Many of the friends he made in the last twenty years of his life were connected with the theatre. In part because of his interest in the stage, and in an attempt to keep the public's favour, driven by the need to make more money to support his two households, his later fiction became more melodramatic and didactic. Although his work remained popular, he never again matched his literary successes of the 1860s.<br>
<br>In 1873 Collins made his only visit to America, taking up an invitation to tour the United States and Canada giving readings from his works. He enjoyed the appreciative audiences, and the less formal manners, and made several new friends. But his health was increasingly precarious, and he found the constant travelling exhausting. He cut short his visit, and made only about &pound;2500 from the tour, considerably less than Dickens had made with his American public readings in 1867.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Law and the Lady</span> (1875) was the first of Collins's novels to be published by Chatto and Windus, who thereafter became his main publishers and later issued collected editions of his novels. (Collins had always wanted his novels to be available to readers of all classes and incomes, and Chatto and Windus agreed to issue thirteen of his earlier titles in 6<i>s</i>. and 2<i>s</i>. editions. After his death Chatto and Windus editions in various formats continued to be issued, from a luxury &#145;Library&#146; edition to a 6<i>d</i>. edition in paper wrappers.) <span class="italic">The Two Destinies</span> (1876) was followed by <span class="italic">The Haunted Hotel</span> (1879), <span class="italic">The Fallen Leaves</span> (1879), and <span class="italic">Jezebel's Daughter</span> (1880), a fictional version of his failed melodrama, <span class="italic">The Red Vial</span>. In 1881 Collins further relieved himself of the business side of authorship when he appointed A. P. Watt as his literary agent. His final play, <span class="italic">Rank and Riches</span>, produced in 1881, was a disastrous failure, and for the remaining eight years of his life he confined himself to writing novels and stories, producing <span class="italic">The Black Robe</span> (1881), <span class="italic">Heart and Science</span> (1883), <span class="italic">I Say No</span> (1884), <span class="italic">The Evil Genius</span> (1886), <span class="italic">The Guilty River</span> (1886), <span class="italic">Little Novels</span> (1887), a collection of short stories, and <span class="italic">The Legacy of Cain</span> (1889).<br>
<br>Collins's health continued to decline. In addition to his long-standing arthritis, he began to suffer from angina, which caused him intense pain. But he still felt deeply involved with his writing. The composition of the antivivisection novel <span class="italic">Heart and Science</span> so excited him that he wrote week after week without a break. He also continued to fight for better conditions for authors. He had been a lifelong campaigner for improvements in international copyright, and was one of the founder members of the Society of Authors in 1884.<br>
<br>In 1888 Collins moved to 82 Wimpole Street. He was by now an invalid, and although he continued to see his close friends he became something of a recluse, in contrast to his earlier conviviality, though he attended a dinner of the Society of Authors in July, &#145;dreadfully crippled&#146;, as his obituarist observed, &#145;but in fair spirits, and anxious for me to point out such celebrities as had risen since his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">The World</span>, 25 Sept 1889, 12). Six months later he survived a carriage accident when he was thrown from a cab in a collision. In June 1889 he suffered a stroke and, fearing that he would not live to complete his last novel, <span class="italic">Blind Love</span> (1890), arranged for Walter Besant to do so. An attack of bronchitis finally led to his death, on 23 September 1889, at his home in Wimpole Street. His funeral was attended by Caroline Graves but not by Martha Dawson or his children, and it is Caroline Graves who shares his grave in Kensal Green cemetery, London, where he was buried on 27 September.<br>
<br>The popularity of Collins's writing, with the exception of his two best-known novels, <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> and <span class="italic">The Moonstone</span>, continued to fall after his death. However, this trend was halted in the last quarter of the twentieth century and has recently been reversed. At the end of the twentieth century all his fiction, with the exception of his first novel, <span class="italic">Antonina</span>, was in print, much of it in inexpensive editions. Television adaptations of the better-known novels, of varying quality, are being produced. As yet, his plays have not been reprinted or restaged. Collins's work is also being re-evaluated. Many of his novels have appeared in critical editions, and there has been a proliferation of studies of his work as the subject of serious critical enquiry.<br>
