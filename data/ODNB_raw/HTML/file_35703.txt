<span class="headword">Redmond,  William Hoey Kearney <span class="st"> [Willie]</span></span>  (1861&#150;1917), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, second son of William Archer Redmond (1825&#150;1880), and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35702/', "John Edward Redmond")</script>, was born in Grassendale, Liverpool, on 13 April 1861. He came from a Catholic family associated with co. Wexford for centuries. His father sat in parliament for the Home Rule Party from 1872 to 1880. His mother, Mary Hoey, of protestant stock, was from co. Wicklow. He had two sisters. He grew up at Ballytrent, at the south-eastern tip of co. Wexford. He was educated at Carlow College (1871&#150;2) and Clongowes Wood College (1873&#150;6).<br>
<br>After leaving Clongowes, Redmond served in the merchant marine. He then took a second lieutenancy in the Wexford militia in December 1879 (becoming lieutenant in October 1880), and contemplated a regular army career. But he resigned from the militia to join the Land League agitation. He was arrested in February 1882 in possession of seditious literature and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. At Kilmainham he shared a cell with Charles Stewart Parnell, to whom his political loyalty never wavered. He went to the United States in June 1882 with Michael Davitt to collect funds for the Land League. In February 1883 he arrived with his brother in Australia, with which he developed close links. Here he met Eleanor Mary Dalton (<i>d</i>. 1947), eldest daughter of James Dalton, of Orange, New South Wales (he married her in London in February 1886); her aunt, James Dalton's half-sister, Johanna, married John Redmond in September 1883. The Redmonds collected &pound;15,000 for the Irish National League, and then travelled to the United States and collected &pound;15,000 more. In his absence, in July 1883, he was elected MP for Wexford, his father's old constituency.<br>
<br>Willie Redmond sat as an MP until his death, representing Wexford (1883&#150;5), North Fermanagh (1885&#150;92), and East Clare (1892&#150;1917). He was a frequent speaker in the Commons, but the ardour of his speeches often exceeded their intellectual coherence. He was ejected several times from the house for his excesses and involved in several violent confrontations with Unionist MPs. He remained popular, even with his political opponents. He was even less restrained on Irish platforms and there often spoke of violent insurrection (when the time was ripe). Yet he remained a constitutionalist at heart. He was imprisoned for three months in September 1888 for helping to resist an eviction. When the Irish party split in 1890 he supported Parnell completely. His only child, a boy aged five, died early in 1891; he had no more children. After Parnell's death in October 1891, under stress of emotion, he lost all sense of political direction for a time. One of the most devout Catholics in the Irish party, he was deeply grieved by the opposition of that church to Parnell. In 1891 he was called to the Irish bar, but never practised.<br>
<br>Redmond joined with younger nationalists, such as Arthur Griffith and Maud Gonne, to oppose the South African War. He was co-treasurer to the Irish Transvaal committee. He was imprisoned again in November 1902 for inflammatory speeches. He made numerous visits to Irish communities worldwide, and wrote two books on his Australian journeys: <span class="italic">A Shooting Trip to the Australian Bush</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Through the New Commonwealth</span> (1906). The dominion status enjoyed by Canada and Australia influenced his conception of eventual Irish home rule. A strict teetotaller but inveterate smoker, he devoted much time to encouraging tobacco growing in Ireland.<br>
<br>Willie Redmond will be remembered for his part in the First World War. He threw himself behind his brother's support for the war. Although fifty-four, he enlisted as a captain in the 6th Royal Irish regiment of the 16th (Irish) division, largely composed of nationalists. He went overseas in December 1915, and commanded B company of his battalion for six months. He wrote several newspaper articles (published posthumously in 1917 as <span class="italic">Trench Pictures from France</span>). The Easter rising of 1916 shook him, and he seems to have realized that the tide was now turning away from constitutional nationalism. His health broken, he was transferred to a staff post. He was promoted major in July 1916. When on leave he spoke in the Commons, most famously in March 1917, when he defended Irish involvement in the war and asked for immediate home rule. He believed that by serving together in the trenches the Unionist and nationalist traditions could be reconciled after the war.<br>
<br>Redmond got permission to join his battalion for the attack on Wytschaete on 7 June 1917. Wounded, apparently lightly, he died that day at Dranoutre, Belgium, in the field hospital of the Unionist 36th (Ulster) division, which attacked alongside his unit. His death caused grief worldwide. He was buried the next day in the garden of the convent at Locre in Belgium. The grave, symbolic perhaps in its isolation, is still there today. Commemorations at Loker (organized by local people) took place in 1967 and 1997. In Wexford there is a bust of him in a local park. His Irish home, Glenbrook, Delgany, co. Wicklow, still stands. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Willie Redmond was very different from his brother: open-hearted, volatile, pugnacious, and garrulous. Until the war rapidly aged him he had a perennially youthful (albeit well-rounded) aspect. He was more radical than his brother on many social issues, such as female suffrage. He seems now the most representative figure of the thousands of Irish nationalists who served with the British forces in 1914&#150;18. The East Clare constituency left vacant by his death was, tellingly, won by Eamon de Valera of Sinn F&eacute;in.<br>
