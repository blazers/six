<span class="headword">Du Cros,  (William) Harvey</span>  (1846&#150;1918), <span class="occ">pneumatic tyre manufacturer</span>, was born in Dublin on 19 June 1846, son of Edouard Pierce Du Cros and his wife, Maria Molloy. The family was of Huguenot origin, an ancestor, Jean Peter Du Cros, having settled in Dublin at the beginning of the eighteenth century as a refugee from religious persecution. Du Cros was briefly educated at a blue coat school for the children of distressed gentlefolk, King's Hospital, Dublin (1855&#150;60), and when he was fifteen started on a series of minor commercial posts as clerk and later as an unqualified bookkeeper. At the same time he left home, according to his son Arthur, because of differences between his parents. In 1866 he married Annie Jane Roy (<i>d</i>. 1899); he had six sons by his mid-twenties. At twenty-three he became part-time assistant secretary of the fledgeling Irish Commercial Travellers' Association.<br>
<br>A small, wiry, but immensely determined man, with a long and carefully waxed moustache, Du Cros was once described as &#145;of no particular physique&#146; but &#145;never known to acknowledge defeat&#146;. He was advised to take up sport for the sake of his health at thirty, and followed the prescription so enthusiastically that he became boxing champion of Ireland at two weights, its fencing champion, and founder and captain of the Bective Rangers Football Club, which won the Irish Rugby championship. He was also a leading amateur cyclist and president of the Irish Cyclists' Association. He insisted his sons follow his example, boxing against them in the gym and forming them into a successful team of racing cyclists on the solid-tyred penny-farthing machines then popular.<br>
<br>A turning point came for Du Cros when two of his sons were defeated by an unfancied Ulster cyclist using the rudimentary pneumatic tyres invented by John Boyd Dunlop, a Belfast vet. Du Cros instantly appreciated their possibilities and after successful racing trials of the tyres was invited by William Bowden, a Dublin cycle agent to whom Dunlop had informally made over the rights, to set up a company to exploit them. Du Cros insisted on complete control, wrote the prospectus, and effected the public issue of 15,010 &pound;1 shares in 1889. Shrewdly he linked the company with an established cycle agency as the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency Ltd, providing early cash flow, and absorbed the Belfast cycle firm which had made the early tyres.<br>
<br>Du Cros's practical commercial sense and public relations flair carried the company through in spite of the revocation of Dunlop's patent in 1890, barely a year after the flotation, when it was found to have been anticipated. Du Cros rapidly arranged to purchase a separate patent relating to the way the tyre was attached, a key problem for early tyres, and employed the inventor, Charles Kingston Welch. Six years later the owner of a rival patent was bought out. Du Cros inserted his team of sons into the business, sending them to different countries to establish the company. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32914/', "Arthur Du Cros")</script> became general manager and another, Harvey, became a major investor in the Austin motor company.<br>
<br>In 1896 Du Cros secured his fortune when he sold the company, with an issued capital of &pound;260,000, to a group including the motor speculator Ernest T. Hooley for &pound;3 million, subsequently taking part in the reflotation as the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company. He and Arthur became joint managing directors and the company expanded in step with the motor industry, producing its first motor tyre in 1900 (though significantly later than Michelin in France) and later diversifying into golf balls and aero-tyres. Manufacture moved to Coventry in 1893 and was expanded into the production of rubber, cotton, and other components for the tyres. The style was so confident that when the crucial Welch patent expired, Du Cros held a wake, inviting 400 people to celebrate. Among other activities, he helped finance the first airship for the British army and organize the first motorized movement of British troops. In 1906 he became a Conservative MP against the run of Liberal success, standing for Hastings on a platform of tariff controls to protect industry.<br>
<br>Du Cros's first wife died in 1899 and he later married Florence Gibbings of Bow in Devon. By the time of his death at Inniscorrig, Dalkey, co. Dublin, on 21 December 1918, Dunlop was Britain's fourteenth biggest manufacturing company. Without Du Cros, his contemporaries believed, it could never have survived.<br>
