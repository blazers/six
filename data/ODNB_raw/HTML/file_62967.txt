<span class="headword">Joyce,  Patrick Weston</span>  (1827&#150;1914), <span class="occ">educationist and antiquarian</span>, was born at Ballyorgan on the northern side of the Ballyhoura Hills in the barony of Coshlea in the south-east of co. Limerick, Ireland. He was one of eight male children of Garrett Joyce (<i>b</i>. 1794), shoemaker, and his wife, Elizabeth O'Dwyer (<i>b</i>. 1794), the granddaughter of a Major Weston of Ballinacurra-Weston near Limerick city. His brother Robert, three years Patrick's junior, was also given a metronymic; in his case that of Dwyer. Trained as a teacher, Robert Dwyer Joyce (who died in 1883 aged fifty-three) qualified and practised in medicine and is remembered as a writer of nationalist ballads.<br>
<br>Descended paternally from co. Galway Joyce stock who were settled in Limerick since the mid-eighteenth century, Patrick Weston Joyce had, as grandfather, a Joyce known as Roibe&aacute;rd an Gaeilgeoir (Robert the Irish Language Speaker) who died in 1828, and, as father, a Joyce known as Garrett the Scholar&#151;with a reputation for poetry and religious debate. The family, having moved, in 1830, from Ballyorgan to the village of Glenosheen, a mile further west at the base of Seefin Mountain, Patrick Weston grew up in a partly Irish-speaking pre-famine rural community whose culturally rich mix of Gaelic ancestral tradition, palatine settlement custom, and Anglo-Irish gentry he was to recall fondly throughout a long life lived, from his twenties on, away from co. Limerick.<br>
<br>Having attended a hedge school at Fanningstown and rural private academies at Kilfinnan, Galbally, and Kilmallock, Joyce was unusual in attempting both the classics and science curricula at the Market House School in Mitchelstown, south across the co. Cork border. In 1845, aged eighteen, he was himself employed as a teacher by the commissioners of national education in Ireland and subsequently became principal of the model school at Clonmel, co. Tipperary. In 1856, having married Caroline Waters of Baltinglass, co. Wicklow, he was appointed to a team of educationists charged with the reorganization of national school education. Moving to Dublin, he combined his employment with further study at Trinity College, graduating BA there in 1861 and proceeding MA three years later.<br>
<br>Joyce's abilities as a career educational administrator and an amateur antiquarian researcher gained him the honorary degree of LLD from Trinity College in 1870 and the principalship in 1874 of the National Education Commissioners' training college at Marlborough Street, Dublin. He remained in this post until his retirement from the public service in 1893. His reputation then as an eminent educationist was, in time, to be replaced by his reputation as a historian and topographer.<br>
<br>Joyce published in the region of thirty books on educational, literary, historical, topographical, and antiquarian subjects, the majority dating from after his retirement from the Marlborough Street College. During the remaining twenty years of his life he produced work that contributed substantially to several fields of Irish scholarship. It was justly said of him that &#145;all his qualities and gifts were spent prodigally in making the Ireland of the past known to the living generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Independent</span>, 8 Jan 1914). Elected to membership of the Royal Irish Academy in 1863, he served on the academy's council from 1884 to 1895. He was a member of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland from 1865, and was elected a fellow and served as president of the society from 1906 to 1908. He was a founder member of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language at its first formal meeting in December 1876 but resigned in March 1880 during a period of public controversy in the affairs of the society. He remained, however, well disposed to the society and its aims. Two of his publications of 1879, <span class="italic">Old Celtic Romances</span> and <span class="italic">A Grammar of the Irish Language</span> were well received by its members and the society later published his <span class="italic">The Book of Irish Music and Song</span> (1888).<br>
<br>A meeting with George Petrie, antiquarian and music collector, in 1853, had motivated Joyce to collect Irish music and song. He published four such collections in all, the last of which, <span class="italic">Old Irish Music and Songs</span> (1909) contained hundreds of hitherto unpublished tunes. He claimed to have always kept a piece of music paper in his pocket to jot down airs that he remembered from his youth or encountered in the course of his travels. While the accuracy and authenticity of his transcriptions have been questioned and faulted by later musical scholarship, he is credited with having been among the earliest field collectors of Irish musical tradition.<br>
<br>Apart from his publications on teaching methods and on school management, which were standard textbooks in their day, Joyce achieved a wide readership with works of popular history. <span class="italic">A Child's History of Ireland</span> (1898) was approved for use in national schools and was adopted also, as a Catholic school text, in New York and in Australia. <span class="italic">A Social History of Ancient Ireland</span> (1903) gave a pioneering account of daily social and domestic life and of popular custom and ritual. Another pioneering work was <span class="italic">English as we Speak it in Ireland</span> (1910), for which Joyce drew on contemporary Hiberno-English usage as well as on Irish, on older English, and on the dialects of Scotland. <span class="italic">The Wonders of Ireland</span> (1911) includes an essay on &#145;Spencer's [<i>sic</i>] Irish Rivers&#146;, a topic of likely interest to Joyce since Edmund Spenser's Irish home at Kilcolman Castle was just south of the Ballyhoura Hills close to the Glenosheen of Joyce's youth&#151;and lifelong euphoric recall.<br>
<br>Joyce's most enduring work was <span class="italic">The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places</span> (1869&#150;1913), whose three volumes, despite modern specialist scholarship, are still the starting point for research into the topography of Ireland as a whole. As an amateur scholar of place names&#151;even with a native speaker's control of the Irish language&#151;he was unequipped for the task of following the detailed transformation of place-name forms in Gaelic and Anglo-French and English. He nevertheless achieved a remarkable degree of accuracy in his interpretations.<br>
<br>Patrick Weston Joyce, in his Irish researches and publications, consciously addressed a wider public than did the scholarly antiquarians who were surely his models: Edward Bunting and the trio of George Petrie, John O'Donovan, and Eugene O'Curry, who were associated with the work of the Irish ordnance commission and who strove to record the local history and folklore, the ethnography and the topography of the Irish countryside. In all these fields Joyce was self-taught. His selfless labours outside, and subsequent to, his professional career as an educationist mark him out as a major Irish representative of the tradition of polymath Victorian amateur scholarship of the highest integrity. In his case it was a scholarship carried on by one who felt a patriotic duty to the languages and cultural heritage of his native place and of Irish people.<br>
<br>Joyce died at his home, Barnalee, Leinster Road West, Rathmines, Dublin, on 7 January 1914, aged eighty-seven years, having been sick for some five weeks. He was buried in a private funeral ceremony at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. With his wife, Caroline, who predeceased him, he had three sons and two daughters, all of whom survived him. His eldest son, Weston St John Joyce, wrote <span class="italic">Dublin and its Neighbourhood</span> (1912). Patrick Weston Joyce and his brother Robert are commemorated together in the Joyce Brothers' School, held annually in September at Kilfinnan.<br>
