<span class="headword">Goodman,  James</span>  (1828&#150;1896), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman and music collector</span>, was born on 22 September 1828 at Ballyameen, Dingle, co. Kerry, third of the nine children of Revd Thomas Chute Goodman (<i>bap</i>. 1793, <i>d</i>. 1864) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gorham, of Castleisland, co. Kerry. His father and paternal grandfather John were successive curates in the Church of Ireland (Anglican) parish of Dingle. He is believed to have received private tuition&#151;from either a neighbour, Joseph King, or a Mr Earle&#151;before entering Trinity College, Dublin, in 1846 to read arts and qualify himself in divinity. He graduated BA in 1851 and was ordained a priest on 22 May 1853.<br>
<br>In October 1852 Goodman married Charlotte King (1826&#150;1888), daughter of his presumed former tutor King. The Kings lived at Ventry, the Goodmans near by on a rented farm of 105 acres overlooking the sea. Goodman was by then working as curate for the Irish Church Missions&#151;to convert Irish-speaking Roman Catholics to protestantism&#151;and thus continued in different parts of co. Cork until becoming rector of Abbeystrewry parish (later canon of Ross) and taking up residence in the rectory at Baltimore Road, Skibbereen. During the 1850s the couple had had three sons: Francis George (<i>b</i>. 15 July 1853), Godfrey (<i>b</i>. 13 Dec 1854), and James (<i>b</i>. 11 Nov 1856), who died in an accident in 1881. Frank and Godfrey both moved to England, their descendants living in England and Wales.<br>
<br>The English surname Goodman appears in Ireland from at least the seventeenth century. Its English origins were remembered: Goodman's grandfather evidently occupied in later life the living at Kemerton, Gloucestershire, which had been held by Godfrey Goodman, bishop of Gloucester (1583&#150;1656). Goodman wrote of his family's English descent and his own Irishness as of a paradox:<blockquote>Yet I am not of the old root of the Gaels but of Saxon stock, though my ancestors settled long ago in the West of co. Kerry, where they learned the Irish language and &hellip; became, as we say, nearly <i>ipsis hibernicis hiberniores</i>. Thus nothing was dearer to me from my youth than to be listening to the old tales of adventure and the stories of Fionn, nor any music sweeter in my ears than the surpassingly sweet music of Ireland. (trans. from &Oacute; Fiannachta, &#145;D&iacute;onbhrollach&#146;, 222&#150;3)</blockquote>For all we know, Goodman may never have left Ireland. There he grew up speaking Irish with the ease of his Kerry neighbours and writing it with academic competence. He was, in fact, appointed professor of Irish at Trinity College, Dublin, on 21 June 1879, and thereafter spent each year partly in Dublin, while a curate had charge of his parish. The little he wrote was usually in Irish, including hymns and moral texts for the use of converts. Similarly motivated but more unusual is the long, partly published Gaelic poem in debate form (anonymous but certainly his) on the merits of the Roman Catholic and protestant religions: <span class="italic">The Debate of Brian and Art</span>. But his interest in literature expressed itself chiefly in collecting manuscripts in older Irish, sharing their contents with others, copying them himself in elegant Gaelic script, and signing this scribal work S&eacute;amus Gudman[n]. An Irish manuscript tradition still existed in his day: in December 1848 it was to a local scribe he turned, Patrick Landers, to get the written words of a song, &#145;An buachaill caol dubh&#146; (&#145;The Slim Dark Fellow&#146;).<br>
<br>Goodman compiled four volumes of musical fair copies&#151;his chief legacy&#151;between 1860 (or somewhat earlier) and 1866. They make up Trinity College, Dublin, MSS 3194&#150;3197, and contain some 2300 tunes&#151;all monophonic&#151;in his hand. He identifies over 500 as his own notations from &#145;Munster pipers &amp;c.&#146;. A local piper was his major source: Tom Kennedy, a convert to protestantism whom he must have known well and met often. Goodman, moreover, was himself an uilleann piper: his notations sometimes suit the pipes better than other instruments, or, if song airs, better than the voice. Of his remaining tunes many come from unknown manuscripts or oral sources, others from manuscripts or published texts identified or conjectured. The second category displays the breadth of his interests, not only in traditional Irish but in other musical varieties, including popular urban, operatic, military, classical, Scottish, and English.<br>
<br>Of greatest intrinsic value is Goodman's orally transmitted Irish music. Dance tunes&#151;jigs, reels, and hornpipes&#151;with marches and the two unusual descriptive pieces, &#145;The Fox Hunt&#146; and &#145;Allisdrum's March&#146;, comprise the best of the instrumental items. The airs&#151;of songs in Irish or English&#151;were noted from singing or playing, chiefly in ornate versions. The best of them are lyrical, including love songs and laments. It is unfortunate that Goodman, despite his apparent claim to have copied words of the songs, did not include them with his melodies. But his linguistic, instrumental, and vocal talents undoubtedly gave his notations idiomatic quality unusual in his century.<br>
<br>Goodman died at Skibbereen rectory on 18 January 1896, and was buried nearby at Creagh on the 21st. His collection long remained in manuscript, but the first of two volumes edited by the undersigned appeared in 1998 as <span class="italic">Tunes of the Munster Pipers: Irish Traditional Music from the James Goodman Manuscripts</span>.<br>
