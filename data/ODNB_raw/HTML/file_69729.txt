<span class="headword">Marryat,  George Selwyn</span>  (1840&#150;1896), <span class="occ">angler</span>, was born on 20 June 1840 at Chewton Glen, Milton, Hampshire, the second of the eight children of Lieutenant-Colonel George Marryat and Georgiana Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Selwin, and nephew to the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18097/', "Frederick Marryat")</script>. By 1854 the family had moved to Mapperton House, Dorset, and George Marryat's passion for fly-fishing first blossomed on the River Frome at Maiden Newton in Dorset. After his education at Winchester College (1854&#150;7) his family bought him a commission in the 6th dragoon guards (the carabiniers). He served in India (1859&#150;61) and after deployment on the subcontinent his regiment returned to England, where Marryat received his promotion to second lieutenant on 28 January 1862. After resigning and selling his commission in 1864 he travelled to Australia, where he became a stock rider in the bush.<br>
<br>Marryat returned to his homeland after a sojourn of about five years. He was living in Edinburgh by about 1872, probably the year in which he married Lucy Dorothea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clinton (1843&#150;1911), daughter of Colonel Frederick Clinton of Ashley Clinton, in Hampshire. They moved back to Hampshire at the end of 1874, and settled at Shidfield (Shedfield), Hampshire. Over the next five years they had three daughters.<br>
<br>While at Winchester College Marryat had fished on the River Itchen, at a time when the dry fly was the established way to catch trout. Following his return from Australia he became the most expert and celebrated dry-fly fisherman on the southern chalk streams. A chance meeting in April 1879 between Marryat and Frederic Michael Halford, in the hut by the Sheepbridge shallows on the River Test in Hampshire, formed a fishing partnership that has not been equalled. Halford had admitted to Marryat his many shortcomings with tying artificial flies; Marryat resolved to help in any way he could. The partnership produced two very significant books, <span class="italic">Floating Flies and How to Dress Them</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">Dry Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice</span> (1889). Without Marryat's input it is arguable that Halford would not have written them; but Marryat refused Halford's request to become co-author on the ground that &#145;it would be impracticable to have two writers&#146;. His only known publications were two letters, one in <span class="italic">The Field</span> of 8 January 1881, entitled &#145;Quill bodies for flies&#146;, and one in the <span class="italic">Fishing Gazette</span> of 28 June 1884, entitled &#145;Who invented dry-fly fishing?&#146;. Marryat conducted much of the early fieldwork on the development of the up-eyed &#145;Snecky Limerick&#146; hook and the new methods of dressing the artificial split-winged dry flies on these new hooks, working closely with Henry Sinclair Hall.<br>
<br>By 1885 Marryat and his family had moved to the cathedral close in Salisbury, Wiltshire. It was here that he did his most important work on the entomology of the fly-fisherman's natural insect and its matching artificial fly. An accomplished fly-dresser, amateur photographer, and microscope-user, he linked the last two enthusiasms in his fascination for karyokinesis (cell division). He had endless patience, setting about all this research and documentation with a will that was typical of the Victorian country gentleman. He was modest by nature, but widely read, knowing his Shakespeare almost by heart. Marryat could be the life and soul of the party when in the right company, but did not suffer fools gladly.<br>
<br>Marryat died on 14 February 1896; he suffered influenza followed by a coma, and finally succumbed to a stroke. He was cremated four days later and his ashes were scattered beneath the cedar trees in the cloisters of Salisbury Cathedral. The dry-fly discipline today would not be as complete without Marryat's mastery. He died leaving behind him the most uncontested reputation in the history of trout fly-fishing.<br>
