<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kyle,  (John) Keith</span>  (1925&#150;2007), <span class="occ">journalist, broadcaster, and historian</span>, was born at the nursing home in Sturminster Newton, Dorset, on 4 August 1925, the only child of William Ernest Kyle (1890&#150;1969), land agent, and his wife, Elsie Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maule (1895&#150;1972). His parents were then living in nearby Iwerne Minster. He led a relatively solitary childhood as his parents feared that too close an association with the village children would leave him with an indelible west-country accent. In his early years he was taught at home by his mother, a qualified schoolteacher, who was determined that her son should be the first member of her family to go to both public school and university. At the age of nine he was sent to a nearby preparatory school, Chafyn Grove in Salisbury, from where he won a scholarship to Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire. A delicate boy, never any good at games, he found himself fully at home in the school library. His reward was to win an exhibition to Magdalen College, Oxford. By then the Second World War was well under way but those under the call-up age of eighteen were encouraged to spend two or even three terms at university before being required to join the forces. Kyle spent the Hilary and Trinity terms of 1943 being tutored by the already celebrated Oxford don A. J. P. Taylor, with whom he was to form a lifelong friendship.<br>
<br>Summoned to the colours in November 1943 Kyle at first joined the infantry but later transferred to the Royal Artillery, into which he was commissioned in 1944. Not released from the army until 1946&#151;he spent most of the intervening period serving in India, where he reached the rank of acting captain&#151;he returned to Oxford in the Michaelmas term of 1947, continuing his studies in modern history under Taylor and embarking on medieval history with another celebrated Magdalen don, Bruce McFarlane, as his tutor. A promising pupil, who was also able to play a full part in the university Liberal club (of which he became chairman) and the Oxford Union, he seems to have hoped to become an academic. A disappointing second-class degree in 1950 effectively put an end to that ambition, though Magdalen generously renewed his exhibition, allowing him to spend his last term as secretary of the Oxford Union.<br>
<br>At this time there were real anxieties about Kyle's health. He appears to have suffered from an undiagnosed version of myalgic encephalomyelitis (probably the cause of his relative failure in his degree examinations) and it was with some trepidation that he took up his first job in London. This was at the English Speaking Union headquarters in Mayfair, where he helped to run the organization's publications and meetings. It had not, in fact, been his first choice of employment as he had previously applied for a talks producer's job with the North American service of the BBC. The corporation, though, had taken so long to respond that, despairing of getting a positive answer, Kyle went to the English Speaking Union instead. He was rescued, however, when Bush House (its grant-in-aid from the Foreign Office having finally come through) offered him employment at double the salary he was receiving from the English Speaking Union.<br>
<br>In 1953 Kyle's experience in dealing with North American topics prompted him to apply for a Commonwealth Fund travelling fellowship in the United States. On the awards panel sat Geoffrey Crowther, the editor of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, who&#151;according to Kyle's account&#151;gave him a particularly hard time. There was, however, a reason for that, Crowther having decided that the gangling youth in front of him (Kyle stood 6 feet 3 inches in his socks) would make an admirable correspondent for his own paper in Washington. Although it meant sacrificing the Commonwealth fellowship, which Crowther was kind enough to tell him he had already been awarded, Kyle had no hesitation about accepting the <span class="italic">Economist</span> offer. That autumn he arrived in Washington to take up his post as the first-ever British resident correspondent for the weekly. It was a glittering opportunity, and Kyle seized it with both hands. He was to spend five years working for <span class="italic">The Economist</span> in the United States, years that saw the formal desegregation of the nation's schools, the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, the 1956 presidential election, and the emergence of the young John F. Kennedy as a potential White House contender. Reporting latterly also for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> (which had a New York but not a Washington correspondent) Kyle&#151;although his contributions to <span class="italic">The Economist</span> were necessarily anonymous&#151;effectively made his reputation as a commentator on the American scene.<br>
<br>It was no surprise to his expatriate journalistic colleagues in Washington when Kyle was summoned home in the autumn of 1958 to become <span class="italic">The Economist</span>'s political and parliamentary correspondent. Again he dazzled and shone. From his first report on a particularly ill-fated Liberal assembly held at Torquay through his coverage of the 1959 general election to his vivid evocation of the gradual disintegration of the Macmillan government, he set a new standard in political reporting. He also became a familiar face on the BBC, appearing regularly on the early evening <span class="italic">Tonight</span> programme and accepting globe-trotting assignments for a variety of television projects. He left <span class="italic">The Economist</span> in 1961 but continued to work as a newspaper journalist (notably for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>) as well as a broadcaster (for both the BBC and independent television). His coverage for both media of decolonization in Africa and the Israeli&#150;Palestinian conflict was highly regarded by his fellow professionals.<br>
<br>By now, however, Kyle's own sphere of interest had become the domestic political arena itself. After the 1959 election he shook off the remnants of his Liberal allegiance and joined the Labour Party. On 29 September 1962 he married Susan Mary (Suzy) Harpur, a television current affairs producer eleven years his junior, and daughter of Douglas George David Harpur, vicar of St Michael's Church, St Albans, and it was at St Albans, in the 1966 general election, that he first stood for parliament. Having lost there he did not find a seat for the 1970 general election, but in 1974 he contested the new constituency of Braintree in both the February and the October general elections. Narrowly losing there the first time, just before the second election he suffered a stroke and, though he managed to appear at the eve-of-poll rally, he was still a thousand votes short of victory. That marked, he declared, the end of his parliamentary aspirations and, while he fought one further election&#151;this time for the Social Democratic Party at Northampton South, where he managed to come second in 1983&#151;that proved in effect to be the case.<br>
<br>The rest of Kyle's career, which included eight years, from 1982 to 1990, on the staff of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), could be dismissed as being an anti-climax. But that would be unfair&#151;for in 1991 came his lasting claim to fame, his definitive account of the Suez crisis of 1956. Entitled simply <span class="italic">Suez</span>, it was easily the best twentieth-century book on that whole bizarre diplomatic and military episode, owing a good deal to the ringside seat that its author occupied in Washington at the time. His other books included <span class="italic">Whither Israel?</span> (1993), <span class="italic">The Politics of the Independence of Kenya</span> (1999), and an engaging and remarkably candid volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">Reporting the World</span>, published posthumously in 2009, but none was to match and certainly not to surpass this model volume of contemporary history which led, quite properly, to his being invited to take up a visiting professorship at the University of Ulster, which he held from 1991 to 1998. He died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at University College Hospital, Camden, London, on 21 February 2007. His funeral was held at his local church of St Mary, Primrose Hill, on 14 March 2007 and he was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. His wife, Suzy, and two adopted sons survived him.<br>
