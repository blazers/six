<span class="headword">Concanen,  Matthew</span>  (1701&#150;1749), <span class="occ">writer and lawyer</span>, was born in Ireland. Nothing is known of his parentage, education, or early life beyond Shiels's statement that he &#145;was bred to the Law&#146;  (Cibber, 5.27). He showed early literary ambitions with a comedy, <span class="italic">Wexford Wells</span>, written in 1719, acted in November 1720 at the Smock Alley Theatre (perhaps by command of Charles O'Hara, Lord Tyrawley), and printed in Dublin in 1721. His <span class="italic">Meliora's Tears for Thyrsis</span>, a conventional pastoral on the death of Thomas, Baron Southwell, and <span class="italic">A Match at Football</span>, a mock-heroic poem in three cantos, dedicated to Richard Bettesworth, were both published in Dublin in 1720. These and a number of shorter poems appeared in Concanen's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1722), dedicated to the duchess of Grafton, wife of the lord lieutenant.<br>
<br>About this time Concanen and his friend James Sterling moved to London, intending to take up journalism. According to Shiels they decided by the toss of a halfpenny that Sterling should oppose and Concanen defend the whig government  (Cibber, 5.27), but Concanen had already sought patronage from at least four prominent whigs in Ireland. <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1724), edited by Concanen, included work by Swift, Parnell, Sheridan, Delany, Brown, Ward, Concanen, and others, and was dedicated to the whig Viscount Gage. Other poems by Concanen appeared in Richard Savage's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems and Translations</span> (1726).<br>
<br>Concanen had praised Pope and expressed some obligation to Swift in his earliest writings, but some of the essays which from 1725 he wrote in the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">British Journal</span> (reprinted in his <span class="italic">The Speculatist</span>, 1730) attacked those two writers. His co-belligerents included his friend Lewis Theobald and the then obscure William Warburton, but, fortunately for Warburton's later cultivation of Pope, his remark, in an ingratiating letter to Concanen on 2 January 1727, that Pope borrowed &#145;for want of genius&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 2.195) was never made public. Joseph Warton believed that Warburton secretly assisted Concanen in one of his anti-Pope publications, <span class="italic">A Supplement to the Profound</span> (1728). Pope believed, probably correctly, that Concanen was the editor of <span class="italic">A Complete Collection</span> (1728), a republication of satirical replies to the Pope&#150;Swift <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, and duly crushed him in <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> (1728) and the apparatus of <span class="italic">The Dunciad Variorum</span> (1729). Swift ridiculed him in <span class="italic">On Poetry: a Rhapsody</span> (1733).<br>
<br>There are songs by Concanen in the <span class="italic">Musical Miscellany</span> (1729) and a few new poems by him in a miscellany, <span class="italic">The Flower-Piece</span> (1731), which he edited. With his friend Edward Roome and the whig politician Sir William Yonge he revised Richard Brome's <span class="italic">The Jovial Crew</span> as a comic opera; it opened at Drury Lane on 8 February 1731 and ran for sixteen performances with Concanen receiving the profits. He was now writing in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> and was a pensioner of Walpole, according to Bolingbroke, who was one of its main targets. Concanen's last publications were a quibbling attack on Pope in <span class="italic">A Miscellany on Taste</span> (1732) and a pro-Walpole <span class="italic">Review of the Excise Scheme</span> (1733).<br>
<br>Concanen was a barrister. On 29 June 1732, through the interest of the duke of Newcastle, he was appointed attorney-general of Jamaica, upon which Warburton wrote him an obsequious congratulatory letter  (BL, Egerton MS 1955, fol. 2). He arrived in Spanish Town on 1 March 1733 and lived there for ten years, performing his duties with credit. As a member of the island's council (the upper legislative house, consisting of twelve members) from April 1733 he resisted the arbitrary actions of successive governors. He was suspended from the council by governor Edward Trelawny in May 1740 but remained attorney-general, and, in September 1742, reluctantly under governor's orders, prosecuted Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle for alleged assault upon Trelawny.<br>
<br>Concanen married in Jamaica; his wife was an opulent widow or planter's daughter, perhaps both (Warburton, 218; Cibber, 5.31). They had no children, but Concanen fathered three illegitimate sons with an unknown partner or partners. His successor as attorney-general was appointed on 24 December 1743, after which, at some unknown date, Concanen returned to London, became a member of Serjeants' Inn and, it seems, lived in affluent retirement from politics and literature until he died of consumption on 22 January 1749. At the end he was perhaps living in Crane Court, Fleet Street, because this is where papers of his were later found, including the letter containing Warburton's imprudent sneer at Pope. By the time this letter was published in 1766 Warburton had shamelessly redrawn the picture of his relationship with Concanen, whom he now painted as a sponger and scoundrel  (Warburton, 218). Concanen was survived by his wife, who married the Hon. Mr Hamilton, and by his three natural sons.<br>
