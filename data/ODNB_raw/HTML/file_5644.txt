<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Conyers</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1599), <span class="occ">soldier and president of Connacht</span>, was the eldest son of George Clifford of Bobbing Court in Kent and his wife, Ursula, daughter of Roger Finch. William, Richard, Thomas, and Conyers Clifford went to Ireland as a family group in the 1570s (the precise relationship between them is unknown), and settled in co. Roscommon under the auspices of the Connacht presidency. William was sufficiently well established as a landowner by 1585 to be allowed concessions in the 1585 composition agreement. Conyers was attached to Roscommon Castle while serving with Sir Nicholas Malby during the early 1580s. However, his military experience was limited and was gained mainly while serving in Europe, usually under the earl of Essex. He was taken prisoner at Lisle in September 1588 but was exchanged for a Spanish prisoner. He was praised for his &#145;forwardness and good directions&#146; when serving as a captain under Essex during the siege of Rouen in 1591 and was knighted in that year. Through his association with Essex, Clifford represented Pembroke borough in the parliament of 1593. Together with his brother Nicholas he was conferred with the degree of MA by the University of Cambridge at a special congregation in 1594/5. He married, after 1594, Mary, daughter of Francis Southwell, of Wymondham Hall, Norfolk, widow of Thomas Sydney of Kent and of Nicholas Gorges of London (<i>d</i>. 1594). They had two sons, Henry and Conyers, and a daughter, Frances, who died young. Clifford's wife survived him, and subsequently married Sir Anthony St Leger; she died on 19 December 1603, aged thirty-seven.<br>
<br>Clifford again served with Essex in 1596 during the Spanish siege of Calais. He was sergeant-major in the expedition against Cadiz later in the same year, had charge of the <i>Dreadnaught</i> with Alexander Clifford, and served on the council. His share of the plunder, &pound;3256, was among the highest recorded. The Nine Years' War was in progress in Ireland when Clifford was appointed chief commissioner of Connacht on 2 December 1596. Having arrived in Dublin on 4 January 1597, he was dispatched to Connacht on 8 February to replace the suspended Sir Richard Bingham. He was effective in limiting the impact on Connacht of the war in Ulster, although hampered by the numbers of Irish in the ranks of his soldiers. He was respected by the Irish as &#145;better and more faithful to his promises&#146; than Bingham had been  (&Oacute; Cl&eacute;righ, 1.133). He recaptured Sligo Castle from O'Donnell in March 1597, but was defeated at Ballyshannon in July&#150;August in an attempted two-pronged military offensive on Ulster.<br>
<br>Officially appointed president of Connacht with effect from 1 January 1598 (by letters patent dated 4 September 1597), Clifford was normally based at Athlone Castle thereafter. His annual fee was &pound;140 and he had a lease of the manor and demesnes of Athlone and Ballymote, and of the abbey of Boyle. He regarded his instructions for the civil government of Connacht as impractical until military victory had been achieved in Ulster. In summer 1599 he led a military expedition north towards Collooney to relieve O'Connor Sligo, then being besieged by Hugh O'Donnell. On 5 August 1599 Clifford was fatally shot by O'Donnell's supporters in an ambush in the Curlew Mountains just north of Boyle, co. Roscommon. Over 200 of his soldiers were killed in the ambush. His body was buried in the monastery at Trinity Island in Lough Key, but his head was taken to Collooney by Brian Oge O'Rourke to be displayed before O'Connor Sligo as a trophy. The King family erected a small tower to mark the spot where Clifford died in the townland of Garroo.<br>
