<span class="headword">Willcocks, Sir  William</span>  (1852&#150;1932), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 27 August 1852, &#145;in a tent in the Dehra Doon&#146;, India  (Willcocks, 13), and was baptized a year later on 13 September 1853, also in India. He was one of four sons and a daughter of Captain William Willcocks (<i>c</i>.1817&#150;1878), irrigation engineer, and his wife, Mary, formerly Martin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36909/', "Sir James Willcocks (1857&#150;1926)")</script>, soldier, was his younger brother. From Devon his parents had migrated to London; his father joined the East India Company and they sailed to India in 1837. Willcocks spent eleven years at Mossoorie School, and at eighteen progressed to Thomason Civil Engineering College at Roorkee, passing out first of his year and carrying off various prizes and medals.<br>
<br>Assigned to construction work on the Ganges Canal in 1872, Willcocks was promoted in 1874&#150;5 to be personal assistant to Colin Scott-Moncrieff, superintending engineer. In December 1876 he married Susan Anne, daughter of the Revd Edward Scott-Moncrieff; they had two sons and two daughters. His wife accompanied Willcocks on many of his tours of inspection, but when he moved to the Betwa River dam, conditions there were so hot that in 1883 she took the children to England.<br>
<br>When Scott-Moncrieff became director of irrigation in Egypt in 1883 there were no experienced engineers in the country and he invited Willcocks, William Garstin, and Murdoch MacDonald to leave India and join him. In January 1884 Willcocks was put in charge of rebuilding the ruined barrage at the head of the Rosetta Nile. With meagre equipment and forced labour Willcocks repaired the barrage sufficiently to improve the cotton crop that winter, with immediate benefit to the peasant farmers.<br>
<br>In Egypt, Willcocks had to contend with a variety of nations and languages, and the ingrained practice of bribery, against which he resolutely turned his face. Eccentric, voluble, and excitable by temperament, he found it difficult to agree to differ with his chiefs and colleagues, and in his thirteen years in Egypt he was not promoted. His family joined him 1884 for about six years before returning again to England. During this period Willcocks surveyed and levelled from Cairo to Wadi Halfa, explored the upper Nile for possible sites for reservoir dams, and lectured on irrigation and applied mechanics at the Polytechnical School where he also presided over examinations.<br>
<br>Before Scott-Moncrieff left Egypt in 1892 Willcocks and the other British engineers had built barrages, and created or improved a network of canals and drains in the delta and in Upper Egypt, significantly increasing the acreage of agricultural land and adding to the prosperity of peasant and nation. Such were the improvements brought about by the engineers that Willcocks was twice the object of thanksgiving prayers in a mosque. By 1890 Willcocks had decided that a dam across the Nile would provide the best reservoir, and he toured Europe to inspect other irrigation works. His great contribution to the subject was his <span class="italic">Report on Perennial Irrigation and Flood Protection for Egypt</span> (1894).<br>
<br>Willcocks proposed to erect a high dam across the granite base of the first cataract at Aswan, capable of storing 85 billion cubic feet of water. During flood the silt laden waters would pass unchecked; the gates would be closed only when the water was clear. His plan was fiercely opposed by British and French archaeologists who pointed out that it would drown the great temple of Philae immediately upstream of the cataract. Eventually a compromise was reached whereby the height of the dam was reduced and some protection given to the temple. Work began in 1898 to Willcocks's design, although he overlooked the need for concrete aprons below the sluices to avoid scour. It was MacDonald who pointed to this defect, thereby incurring Willcocks's enmity. Completed in 1902 at a cost of &pound;2.4 million, the dam was one of the finest achievements of all time. Locally quarried granite stood to the unprecedented length of 6400 feet, while 180 low level sluices controlled the river down to the next barrage at Asyut. But within a few years the supply was inadequate. Against the renewed opposition of the archaeologists, and of Willcocks who saw it as a waste of public money, in 1907&#150;10 the dam was raised to increase its capacity.<br>
<br>Willcocks meanwhile was manager of the Cairo Water Company from 1897 to 1899, then until 1905 managing director of the Daira Sania Land Company, which acquired 250,000 acres of land which were surveyed, divided, and sold for agricultural purposes. In 1901 he spent three months in south Africa, during the South African War, advising on irrigation schemes. He travelled far up the Nile into Uganda where near Kampala he fell ill with blood poisoning and was nursed back to health by his wife and a daughter. He was made CMG in 1898, and knighted in 1902. In the winter of 1904&#150;5 he went to Mesopotamia, then under Turkish rule, where in 1908&#150;10 he achieved the remarkable feat of surveying the water resources of the whole country and drew up plans to revitalize once more the lands of the &#145;two rivers&#146;. He was back at the family home in the Gezira Island suburb of Cairo by 1911 but undertook lecture tours, in Canada in 1912 and in the USA in 1914.<br>
<br>Willcocks regarded himself as the sole Nile authority; he was a nuisance to his successors, and intimidated younger men who dared to challenge his opinions. This arrogance and eccentricity led him into troubled water in 1919 when he and Lieutenant Ralston Kennedy accused MacDonald of having falsified Nile gauge readings in connection with an irrigation scheme; Willcocks also published two defamatory pamphlets. A Nile commission examined the charges and vindicated MacDonald. The two accusers were charged with libel and sedition. Kennedy fled to France where he shortly died; Willcocks stood trial in the supreme consular court from January to March 1920. He was found guilty, but in view of his age and eccentricity, escaped imprisonment and was bound over for a year not to repeat the libel.<br>
<br>After his disgrace Willcocks, never one to show affection for England, found himself ostracized by the British community. He sought comfort in religion and during his remaining years composed a number of religious tracts and translated extracts from the gospels into colloquial Egyptian, and he served as a voluntary worker at the British hospital. After a brief illness Willcocks died of pneumonia in Cairo on 29 July 1932. He was survived by his wife. A modest road in the Gezira commemorates his name.<br>
