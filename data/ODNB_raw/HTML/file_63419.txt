<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Andrew</span> <span class="st"> [Anders Sinklar]</span>  (1555&#150;1625), <span class="occ">army officer and diplomat in the Danish service</span>, was born in Ravenscraig, Scotland, the third son of Henry Sinclair, fifth Lord St Clair (1527&#150;1601), and his first consort, Janet (<i>d</i>. 15 April 1569), daughter of Patrick Lindsay, Lord Lindsay of the Byres. A Scottish nobleman, he was educated in the household of the duc de Guise. In 1591 he became a gentleman of the Danish court under King Christian IV and eventually settled in Denmark, where he was known as Anders Sinklar. He accompanied Christian to Germany in 1597, and acted as a gentleman of the bedchamber to Queen Anna Katrine until he retired from court service in 1600. In that year he married Kirsten (<i>d</i>. 1632/3), daughter of Erik Kaas (<i>d</i>. 1578) and Kirsten Pederrsdatter Galt (1536&#150;1616). They had several children: Henrik, who died as a child, Jacob, Christian, Johanne, Erik, and Christine (mentioned in 1623). Christian IV became godfather to one of their sons in 1607.<br>
<br>Through marriage, Sinclair became <i>lensman</i> (&#145;regional governor&#146;) of Gladsax, in which capacity he worked until 1620. During his subsequent career, he also acted as <i>lensman</i> of Landskrone (1619&#150;21), and of Hammershus with Bornholm (1621&#150;5). During the Danish&#150;Swedish Kalmar War of 1611&#150;13 Sinclair served the Danish-Norwegian army as a captain. After participating in the conquest of &Ouml;land in 1611, he became the commandant of Kalmar on its capture from Sweden. By 1615 he had been appointed colonel of the Sk&aring;ne regiment, and by 1622 was commander of the entire Danish-Norwegian army east of the Baltic Sound. He was ennobled in Denmark in 1616, and was further rewarded in 1617 when he was appointed a member of the Danish <i>rigsr&aring;d</i> (the state council) at the age of sixty-two. Throughout his career he maintained his links with Scotland, travelling with Princess Anna's ambassador to Scotland in October 1589 to participate in her marriage negotiations with James VI. He joined the Danish embassy to Scotland in summer 1594. He proved to be a useful negotiator, uniquely equipped with a familiar knowledge of both Scottish and Danish language and society. After 1603 he acted on seven occasions as the Danish-Norwegian envoy to the Stuart court (1604, 1606, 1612, 1614, 1618, 1619, and 1621).<br>
<br>Early in 1614 James VI and I was asked by Christian IV to arbitrate in his dispute with L&uuml;beck. Sinclair achieved a short-term settlement in the dispute, which was followed up by Sir Robert Anstruther's embassy in 1615. James's diplomatic intervention on behalf of Denmark&#150;Norway once more proved influential with Christian in resolving the issues peacefully. When negotiations between Denmark and Sweden were held at Ulvsb&auml;ck in 1619 Sinclair was present and met the Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus. With the outbreak of the Bohemian war in 1618, the peaceful policies of James VI and I finally faltered. He relied heavily on Sir Robert Anstruther in Denmark to gain Christian IV's support for his schemes to end the war. Christian in turn sent Sinclair, with Frederick G&uuml;nther, to the Stuart court in 1621. Christian sought to build up an evangelical military alliance in northern Europe, comprising Denmark&#150;Norway, the German protestant princes of the lower Saxon circle, the British kingdoms under James VI and I, and any of the free German cities that could be persuaded to join in. Sinclair received instructions to persuade King James to take part in order to resist perceived Habsburg aggression in northern Europe. For his part, James believed that he could find a more appropriate diplomatic solution. Sinclair conducted no further missions to Britain for Christian IV, but continued in his other military and diplomatic capacities until his death at Sinklarsholm, Sk&aring;ne, Denmark, in 1625.<br>
