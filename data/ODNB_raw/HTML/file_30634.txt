<span class="headword">Bass,  Michael Arthur</span>, first Baron Burton  (1837&#150;1909), <span class="occ">brewer and benefactor</span>, was born at Brewery House, High Street, Burton upon Trent, on 12 November 1837, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1631/', "Michael Thomas Bass (1799&#150;1884)")</script>, brewer, and his wife, Eliza Jane (<i>d</i>. 1897), daughter of Major Samuel Arden of Longcroft Hall, Staffordshire. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1860, MA in 1864. On leaving university, he entered the flourishing brewing business of Bass, Ratcliff, and Gretton. He married on 28 October 1869 Harriet Georgiana, daughter of Edward Thornewill of Dove Cliff, Staffordshire; they had a daughter, Nellie Lisa, born on 27 December 1873, who married in 1894 James Evan Bruce Baillie, formerly MP for Inverness-shire.<br>
<br>Already in 1860 Bass, as the firm was invariably known, was one of Britain's leading breweries, with an annual output of 340,000 barrels. By 1876 Bass's production was close on a million barrels. Three years later an article in the <span class="italic">British Mercury</span> (6 June 1879) thought the firm &#145;a mercantile colossus that has o'erstrided every similar institution in England, if not the world &hellip; a monument to the energy of men&#146;. Bass's pre-eminence as a market leader was undoubtedly the achievement of M. T. Bass, but his son was a capable and loyal deputy until his father's death in 1884. Then, for the next quarter of a century, in more difficult times for brewers, he kept the firm on course.<br>
<br>While other brewers stumbled, caught out by a decelerating demand for beer, increasing competition among brewers, the headlong, expensive acquisition of public houses after the mid-1880s, and the temperance movement storm, Michael Bass ensured that Bass retained its supreme reputation for a quality product and sound management (only Guinness&#151;an Irish firm&#151;came to equal its standing in the brewing industry). This was a notable achievement for a third-generation businessman who was a prime exemplar of the richest type of late Victorian plutocrat. Michael Bass's business qualities were numerous: he possessed a sound understanding of brewing (especially of the hop trade); he was proud of his calling; he was genial, a respected manager of his departmental heads; even towards the end of his life he put in a six-hour day at the firm's offices in Burton.<br>
<br>Bass entered parliament in 1865 as Liberal member for Stafford before representing East Staffordshire between 1868 and 1885, and the Burton division of Staffordshire in 1885&#150;6. He proved a popular member of the house, and was a personal friend of W. E. Gladstone. His father having refused both a baronetcy and a peerage, Bass was made a baronet <i>in vita patris</i> in 1882, with remainder to his brother, Hamar Alfred Bass, and his heirs male; Hamar Bass died in 1898, leaving his son, William Arthur Hamar Bass, heir to the baronetcy. Bass was opposed to Gladstone's home-rule policy in 1886, but on other great questions he remained for some time a consistent Liberal. He was raised to the peerage on Gladstone's recommendation on 13 August 1886 as Baron Burton of Rangemore and of Burton upon Trent, both in Staffordshire.<br>
<br>The growing hostility of the Liberal Party to the brewing interest, as shown in their licensing policy, and the widening of the breach on the Irish question, led Lord Burton to a final secession from the Liberals in 1894, and he became a Liberal Unionist under Lord Hartington and Joseph Chamberlain. After 1903 he warmly supported Chamberlain's policy of tariff-reform, and, although in poor health, he initially led the opposition to Herbert Asquith's licensing bill in 1908, which was rejected by the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Always outspoken and good-humoured, Burton was a personal friend of Edward VII, both before and after his accession. The king frequently visited him at his London residence, Chesterfield House, Mayfair, at his Scottish seat, Glen Quoich Lodge, and at Rangemore, his vast house near Burton. The king conferred upon him the decoration of KCVO when he visited Balmoral in 1904. He was a deputy lieutenant and a JP for Staffordshire, and a director of the South Eastern Railway Company. In his younger days he was an active freemason and remained a liberal contributor to masonic charities. An excellent shot and an expert deerstalker, he was long in command of the 2nd volunteer battalion of the North Staffordshire regiment, retiring in August 1881 with the rank of honorary colonel. He built and presented to the regiment the spacious drill hall at Burton, and gave for competition at Bisley the Bass charity vase and a cup for ambulance work.<br>
<br>Burton's gifts and benefactions to the town of Burton were, like those of his father, munificent. Contemporaries compared them with George Peabody and Baroness Burdett-Coutts. When Burton died the <span class="italic">Brewers' Gazette</span> (4 February 1909) reckoned the practical form of his munificence saved the ratepayers of Burton upon Trent 2<i>s</i>. in the pound over many years. He and his father presented Burton with a town hall and municipal offices at a cost of over &pound;65,000. Lord Burton gave club buildings to both the Liberal and Conservative parties in succession; he constructed, at a cost of about &pound;20,000, the ferry bridge which spans the valley at the south end of Burton, and afterwards freed the bridge from tolls at a cost of &pound;12,950, and in 1890 added an approach to it over the marshy ground, known as the Fleet Green Viaduct. As a loyal churchman, he generously contributed towards diocesan funds, but was most notably a builder of churches. St Paul's Church at Burton, built by him and his father, is a miniature late Victorian cathedral. It cost &pound;120,000, with a further &pound;40,000 provided for its endowment. Large sums in addition were given for improvements and embellishments, including &pound;30,000 for a church institute. In addition, father and son built St Margaret's, Burton, and the church at Rangemore, and Lord Burton was in the middle of financing St Chad's, Burton, and the restoration of the old parish church, St Modwen's (at a cost of &pound;20,000), when he died. Since both the Ratcliff and Gretton partners were also church builders in the Burton neighbourhoods, the brewery's patronage of church building&#151;beer and God in harness&#151;is a remarkable example of late Victorian philanthropy.<br>
<br>Burton had a cultivated taste as an art collector, and Chesterfield House, his residence in Mayfair, was furnished in the style of the eighteenth century and contained a choice collection of pictures by English artists of that period which became widely known owing to his generosity in lending them to public exhibitions. Gainsborough, Reynolds, and Romney were especially well represented. His more modern pictures were at Rangemore, and included some of the best work of Stanfield, Creswick, and their contemporaries. At Rangemore he was reckoned to have spent as much as &pound;200,000 on its improvement.<br>
<br>Burton died at his London home, Chesterfield House, Mayfair, on 1 February 1909 after an operation for a kidney affliction and was buried on 5 February at Rangemore church. He was survived by his wife. The grand pallbearers at his funeral were good testimony to his popularity among the aristocracy and his standing in the brewing industry. In default of male heirs, the peerage, by a second patent of 29 November 1897, descended to his daughter and her heirs male. By his will he strictly entailed the bulk of his property to his wife for life, then to his daughter, then to her descendants; and Burton stipulated that every person and the husband of every person in the entail should assume the surname and arms of Bass, and reside at Rangemore for at least four months in every year.<br>
