<span class="headword">Creagh,  William</span>  (1828&#150;1901), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 1 June 1828 at Newry, co. Down, the second son of the seven children of General Sir Michael Creagh (1787&#150;1860), and his wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of Charles Osborne, judge of the king's bench, Ireland, and niece of Sir Thomas Osborne, eighth baronet, of Newtown Anner, co. Tipperary. He came of an old Roman Catholic family, and his father, who entered the army at the age of fourteen, saw much service with the 86th regiment, and was at his death in 1860 colonel of the 73rd regiment; he was the first in the family to become a protestant. His eldest brother, General Charles Creagh-Osborne (<i>d</i>. 1892), after service in India, was commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, from 1878 to 1886; his youngest brother, Major James Henry Creagh (<i>d</i>. 1900), served in the 27th regiment during the Indian mutiny, and retired as a result of illness contracted at that time.<br>
<br>William Creagh was educated for six years at Mr Flynn's private school in Dublin. After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from January 1842 to December 1844, he became a cadet in the East India Company's service, and joined his regiment, the 19th (later the 119th) Bombay infantry, in June 1845. In 1847, being then stationed at Karachi, he was placed by General Walter Scott RE in charge of a district in Upper Sind. He was recalled from administrative duties by the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in the Punjab (April 1848), and served with his regiment through the campaign of 1848&#150;9. His regiment, the 119th Bombay infantry, was called the Mooltan regiment (later the 2nd battalion 9th Jat regiment). Creagh came home early in 1856, and on 29 April 1857 married Haid&eacute;e Sarah Rose, daughter of John Dopping, of Derrycassan, co. Longford; they had five sons and two daughters. She predeceased him. On his wedding trip in 1857 at Killarney, Creagh learned of the uprising and returned to duty, but sailed round the Cape and so did not reach India until Delhi had fallen. However, with his regiment, under Sir Hugh Rose in central India, he took part in the pursuit of Tantia Topi and was present at Tantia's defeat near Jhansi on 1 April 1858, and, a year later, at his capture.<br>
<br>Gazetted captain on 3 February 1860, Creagh successfully administered, by commission from Sir Richmond Shakespear, resident at Indore, the princely state of Dhar, during the minority of its raja (1861&#150;2). On 10 November 1877 Creagh married Dora, younger daughter of Edwin Sturge of Gloucester; they had one son and two daughters. Having been promoted major in 1865, lieutenant-colonel in 1871, and colonel in 1876, he was in command of his regiment when the Second Anglo-Afghan War broke out in 1878. He had earlier shown an aptitude for engineering and had made the first road up to the hill station of Matheran, near Bombay. From 16 December 1878 to 26 February 1879 he was employed with his men in making a military road from Jacobabad to Dadhar, a distance of 109 miles; he then built a further roadway, to the Bolan Pass and on to Dadhar.<br>
<br>For private reasons, Creagh retired in December 1879, with the rank of major-general. He returned to England early in 1880, where he lived at St Leonards, Sussex. Anglican and Conservative, he took an active though unostentatious part in religious, philanthropic, and political affairs. He died at his home, 6 Charles Road, St Leonards, on 23 May 1901, and was buried in the Hastings borough cemetery. He was survived by his second wife. His four sons who reached manhood all entered the army. The eldest, Ralph Charles Osborne, Royal Marines and 5th Punjab infantry, served with distinction in Burma, in Manipur, at the relief of Chitral, in the Kurram valley, and in South Africa, and died at Netley on 27 January 1904.<br>
