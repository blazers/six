<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tradescant,  John, the elder</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">gardener and collector</span>, is thought to have been born in England, perhaps in the 1570s. His antecedents are unrecorded but he seems to have had family connections in East Anglia: possible candidates for his parents have been identified at Corton, while his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27655/', "John Tradescant (bap. 1608, d. 1662)")</script> was to leave legacies to &#145;namesakes&#146; (described by his wife as &#145;kinsmen&#146;) at Walberswick, both villages lying on the Suffolk coast. Anthony Wood's often-quoted reference to &#145;a famous Gardener called Joh. Tredescaut a Dutchman&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2, col. 888) is misconceived, since it refers to Tradescant's indisputably English-born son.<br>
<br>The earliest detail known of Tradescant's life is the record of his marriage on 18 June 1607 at Meopham in Kent to Elizabeth Day, daughter of the late vicar of the parish. From two years later there survives a letter written by Tradescant to William Trumbull, British resident in Brussels, outlining difficulties he has encountered on a passage to Flushing&#151;a journey which suggests (although no reason is given for the visit) that he may already have found a wealthy patron who might send him to the continent in search of garden specimens.<h2>
<a name="Plantcollectingabroad"></a>Plant collecting abroad</h2>Such is the conclusion encouraged by Tradescant's subsequent experience in the service of his first known employer, Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury, at Hatfield House. In 1611, at Salisbury's behest, Tradescant travelled on an extended trip through the Low Countries and Flanders to Paris, buying trees, flowering shrubs, vines, and bulbs for the gardens at Hatfield. The relevant bills, detailing in addition to their purchase prices arrangements for the transport of the specimens to Hatfield, survive in the Salisbury archives. Following the death of the first earl in 1612, Tradescant remained in the employment of the second earl, on whose behalf he again visited France, before transferring his allegiance (by midsummer 1615) to Edward, first Baron Wotton, who then occupied the former monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury.<br>
<br>During the period of his engagement at Canterbury, where his success in growing melons, mandrakes, and other exotics attracted admiring comment from Sir Henry Mainwaring and others, Tradescant was released to accompany an embassy to Tsar Michael Feodorovich, led by Sir Dudley Digges. Tradescant's diary of this &#145;Viag of Ambusad&#146; via the North Cape to Archangel, written in a rude hand and style, survives among the Ashmole manuscripts in the Bodleian Library; its significance was first recognized by Hamel about 1854 and it has been republished with commentaries by Konovalov and by Leith-Ross. Tradescant's official duties evidently were of a negligible nature and while the ambassadorial party set off for the imperial court he was left to pursue three weeks of uninterrupted fieldwork among the coastal flora, noting the characteristics of plants and other wildlife&#151;the first such investigations recorded on Russian soil&#151;and gathering specimens for shipment back to England. Parkinson  (<span class="italic">Paradisi</span>, 346; <span class="italic">Theatrum</span>, 705) identifies white hellebores, purple cranesbill, and other plants among those brought to England on that occasion by &#145;that worthy, curious and diligent searcher and preserver of all natures rarities and varieties, my very good friend, John Tradescante&#146;, and the list of introductions is extended by Boulger. The <i>Rosa Moscovita</i> later recorded at Lambeth was probably introduced on the same occasion.<br>
<br>Another exotic, the &#145;Algiers apricot&#146;, evidently was a trophy from another expedition, on which Tradescant accompanied the fleet sent in 1620&#150;21 under the command of Sir Robert Mansell to quell the Barbary pirates who were proving an increasing hazard to English shipping. He sailed as a gentleman volunteer on the pinnace <i>Mercury</i>, under the command of Captain Phineas Pett, and whatever action he may have seen at sea Tradescant took care to collect such specimens as he could on land, when circumstances permitted: of various &#145;corne flagges&#146;, he later related to Parkinson that he had seen &#145;many acres of ground in Barbary spread over with them&#146;  (Parkinson, <span class="italic">Paradisi</span>, 190); a variety of starry-headed clover is said to have been collected by him during that same voyage at Formentera and, again according to Parkinson, the wild pomegranate &#145;was never seene in England, before John Tradescante &hellip; brought it from parts beyond the Seas, and planted it in his Lords Garden at Canterbury&#146;  (ibid., 430).<br>
<br>In 1623 Tradescant entered the service of George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, on whose account he again visited the Low Countries and Flanders, buying trees and other plants. In 1625, when the duke was sent to France to provide an escort for Charles I's bride, Henrietta Maria, on her introductory journey to England, Tradescant followed in his wake with &#145;my Lords stuff and Trunkes &amp;c&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 12528, fol. 21, no. 19) and took the opportunity to acquire further specimens for the duke's gardens at New Hall in Essex. Two years later he accompanied the duke again to France in less congenial circumstances when Buckingham mounted his ill-conceived attempt to bring relief to the besieged protestants of La Rochelle, a mission that foundered when Buckingham's army was decimated on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;.<h2>
<a name="TheLambethgarden"></a>The Lambeth garden</h2>Following Buckingham's assassination in 1628 Tradescant installed his family in the then relatively undeveloped environs of South Lambeth in Surrey; the original site of the house and garden that were to become so famously associated with &#145;Tradescant's Ark&#146; and his gardens, marked approximately by the present-day Tradescant Road and Walberswick Road, has been precisely located  (Sturdy). There Tradescant established many of the exotics he had personally imported as well as others which arrived more indirectly. Among the latter was the plant with which his name is most closely linked, <i>Tradescantia virginiana</i>, of which Parkinson was to write:<blockquote>This Spider-Wort is of late knowledge, and for it the Christian world is indebted unto that painfull industrious searcher, and lover of all natures varieties, John Tradescant &hellip; who first received it of a friend, that brought it out of Virginia. (Parkinson, <span class="italic">Paradisi</span>, 152)</blockquote>While the house provided a settled base for Tradescant for the remainder of his life, he was to be favoured with two further appointments. The first of these came in 1630 when he was chosen by the king as &#145;Keeper of our gardens, Vines and Silke-wormes&#146; at Oatlands Palace in Surrey (a property which was by this time settled on the queen). Among other duties he carried out there was the laying-out of a new bowling green and the provision of sheltered accommodation for 200 orange trees. His gardening career was crowned in 1637 with his appointment as custodian of the Oxford Physic Garden. The post is likely to have been of an advisory nature and there is little or no evidence of any impact he may have made there; in any case he died within a year of his appointment.<br>
<br>The museum which he was to establish at Lambeth brought fame to Tradescant in equal measure to his gardening activities, although without the latter he could hardly have achieved so much. Early inspiration may have been provided by Sir Walter Cope (<i>d</i>. 1614), whose extensive cabinet was described by the Swiss Thomas Platter in 1599 and on whose behalf Tradescant bought plants to the value of &pound;38 on his visit to the Netherlands in 1611. The same occasion would have provided him with opportunities to visit the well-known collections housed in the botanic gardens and the anatomy school of Leiden University and he was also on intimate terms with the Morin family in Paris, possessors of a &#145;rare collection of shells, Flowers and Insects&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, <i>c</i>.1&#150;6 April, 1644). The greatest impetus to his collecting career undoubtedly came during his years of service to the duke of Buckingham. A letter of 1625, written by Tradescant in Buckingham's name and addressed to Edward Nicholas, then secretary to the navy, exhorts sea captains, ambassadors, and overseas merchants to furnish the duke with all manner of natural and artificial curiosities. The full significance of this letter is difficult to establish: Buckingham's primary interests as a collector lay in the realms of fine art and classical antiquities rather than curiosities, and it is hard to decide whether he merely allowed his gardener to make use of his influential name or whether it reveals a new area of interest on the part of the duke, the everyday administration of which may have been placed in Tradescant's hands. Similarly, Charles I had no recorded interest in curiosities yet a letter of 1633, sent by the secretary of state, Francis Windbank, to the court of the East India Company, desires the company to &#145;write for such varieties as are expressed in a paper thereinclosed, and being returned to deliver them to John Tradescant to be reserved by him for His Majesties Service&#146;  (Leith-Ross, 97). Here again, Tradescant may conceivably have played a curatorial role in this little-known area of the king's interests.<br>
<br>By 1634 Tradescant's own museum was sufficiently well established for a visitor (Peter Mundy) to spend &#145;a whole day in peruseing, and that superficially, such as hee had gathered together&#146;  (R. C. Temple, ed. <span class="italic">The Travels of Peter Mundy in Europe and Asia, 1608&#150;1667</span>, Hakluyt Society, ser. 2, vols. 45&#150;6, 1919, 1&#150;3). A description of the collection from 1638 includes the earliest mention of its most famous surviving treasure, &#145;the robe of the King of Virginia&#146;, better known as &#145;Powhatan's Mantle&#146;. The later history of the collection is discussed in relation to John Tradescant the younger, to whom it passed on his father's death.<br>
<br>The best-known portrait of Tradescant is that by Cornelis de Neve (a relative of Hester Pooks, who was to marry the younger Tradescant shortly after his father's death): it shows a self-assured, keen-eyed figure with a well-tended beard and with a gold ring in his ear. While appealing as an image, it is thought to have been painted posthumously and at second hand, based on a further posthumous portrait by Emanuel de Critz (another kinsman of Hester's), although the fact that both artists were potentially well acquainted with Tradescant before his death encourages the view that they may have produced reasonably accurate likenesses.<br>
<br>Tradescant was buried at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, on 17 April 1638; the churchwardens' accounts record a charge of 5<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. for &#145;the gret bell and black cloth&#146;. In his will, proved on 2 May of that year, he left the lease of the Lambeth property to his son John, along with another lease held at Woodham Walter, Essex; his grandchildren shared leases on further properties in Long Acre and Covent Garden, as well as &pound;150 then held by Lord Goring. Tradescant's wife predeceased him; she was buried at St Mary's on 1 June 1635. The specimens taken home by Tradescant from his extensive travels, and his skill at raising exotic plants in England, considerably increased the number of foreign edible and decorative species henceforth regularly cultivated in English gardens.<br>
