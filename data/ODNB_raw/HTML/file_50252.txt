<span class="headword">Caird, Sir  James Key</span>, baronet  (1837&#150;1916), <span class="occ">jute manufacturer and benefactor</span>, was born on 7 January 1837, the eldest son of the five children of Edward Caird (1806&#150;1889), linen manufacturer of Dundee, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Key (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1843). Edward Caird had founded the business of Caird and Renny, later Caird &amp; Co., linen merchants and manufacturers, and in 1832 he established the Ashton Jute Works at Hawkshill, Dundee. James is first recorded in connection with this factory in 1864, at which time it was operating 208 power looms, and employed some 350 people. About 1868, Edward retired to Finnart, Dunbartonshire, leaving James in control of a flourishing business, at a time of rising prosperity in the linen and jute trades. The opening up of the colonies created enormous demand for coarse canvas for tents and temporary housing, and for bags and sacks to transport produce. The Ashton works was rebuilt in 1876, and extended in 1887, and again in 1906&#150;8. In addition, Caird &amp; Co. purchased Craigie Mill, Arbroath Road, Dundee, in 1905. While not the largest in the Dundee area, Caird's mills were said to be the best equipped, and he was acknowledged locally as a technical innovator and an effective and benevolent manager. By the time of his death Caird was employing 2000 workers.<br>
<br>On 16 July 1873 Caird married Sophie (1844/5&#150;1882), daughter of George Gray, a solicitor and banker of Bowerswell, Perthshire, and his wife, Sophia Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jameson. Their one daughter died in early life, and Caird's wife died in 1882. He became a generous benefactor, his gifts totalling about &pound;250,000, the greater part of this bestowed on the people of Dundee. His great interest in medical provision in the city was manifested in gifts to Dundee Royal Infirmary to found a women's and children's ward (1897) and an outpatient department (1909). In addition, he provided money for the foundation of a cancer hospital (1902) and the Springrove Home for Old Men (1911), and his donation of &pound;5000 kept the Sidlaw Sanatorium open. He purchased Dens of Mains and adjacent land in 1912 and 1913 to be enjoyed as a public park, later named after him. He was created a baronet in the new year honours of 1913, and received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of St Andrews. He did not live to see the outcome of his largest donation, a gift of &pound;100,000 in 1914 for the building of a new city hall in Dundee. George V laid the foundation stone in 1914, but construction was interrupted by war and it was opened by the prince of Wales on 11 December 1922. Sir James had a long-standing interest in science and was a life member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) from 1861. When the BAAS met in Dundee in 1867 he spoke on &#145;an iron comb for power looms&#146;. When the association again met at Dundee in 1912 he made an unconditional gift of &pound;10,000, which was distributed by the council to various worthy scientific projects. In 1913 he gave a further &pound;1000 to be devoted to the study of radioactivity. &pound;1000 went to the Zoological Society of London, of which he was a member, for a new insect house, and the Royal Society received &pound;5000 for physical research. As a known benefactor, he was approached in 1914 by Edward Shackleton, who was seeking support for his Antarctic expedition. Caird, who was a linguist and well-travelled, had no interest in polar exploration, but was impressed by Shackleton's determined search for financial backing. A few days after their meeting he sent a cheque for &pound;24,000 with no conditions attached, expressing the hope that other wealthy backers would follow suit. The Caird coast, Weddell Sea, was named in his honour, as was the whaler in which Shackleton sailed from Elephant Island in Antarctica to South Georgia to obtain help for the stranded expedition.<br>
<br>In later life Caird was a recluse, playing no part in civic or public life. A well-built man, he wore a moustache and beard, somewhat in the manner of King Edward VII. He died on 9 March 1916 at his home, Belmont Castle, Meigle, Perthshire, and was buried at Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. His only close surviving relative was an elder sister, Mary Ann Maryat, who continued his benevolent work.<br>
