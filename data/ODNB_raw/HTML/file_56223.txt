<span class="headword">Brailsford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Malloch]</span>,  Jane Esdon</span>  (1874&#150;1937), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born on 3 April 1874 in Elderslie, Renfrewshire, one of the six children of John Malloch (<i>d</i>. 1898), a Scottish cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Margaret Marion McLeod. On leaving Paisley grammar school, she matriculated in 1893 at Glasgow University, where she studied philosophy and Greek, the latter under Gilbert Murray, for whom she developed a passionate, if unrequited, attachment. She was also a founder of the Glasgow University Fabian Society, launched in the spring of 1896. A headstrong young woman, widely acknowledged as a promising Hegelian, she possessed remarkable beauty, which not only made her the cynosure of a host of undergraduate contemporaries, but was later to arouse the ardour of Henry W. Nevinson and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt. After completing her studies in 1896, she went to Oxford where she attended Somerville College for one year before returning to Glasgow and eventually consenting to marry her persistent suitor and former philosophy instructor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32033/', "Henry Noel Brailsford (1873&#150;1958)")</script>.<br>
<br>Immediately after a civil marriage ceremony on 29 September 1898, Jane Brailsford accompanied her husband to Crete, where he was serving as a foreign correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. In 1903 the Brailsfords travelled to Macedonia to report on the Bulgarian insurgency, later returning for five months in 1903&#150;4 as relief agents following an uprising against Turkish rule. In addition to assisting her husband to distribute food and relief funds collected by the Macedonian Relief Committee, Jane Brailsford administered a hospital in Ochrida until a bout of typhus forced her to return to England. During the years in which H. N. Brailsford gained prominence as a leader writer and foreign correspondent for a succession of Liberal daily and weekly newspapers, Jane Brailsford attempted to discover her own creative outlets, first as a novelist and later as an actress, but to no avail. Whether she was impeded because she was a woman or simply because, despite earlier promise, she lacked talent is unclear, but her efforts to build a reputation for herself other than as an adjunct to her husband and as an occasional participant in radical campaigns proved abortive.<br>
<br>An advocate of votes for women, Jane Brailsford joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies but, impatient with constitutionalist moderation, she began to participate in militant demonstrations, shifting her affiliation to the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1909. Inspired by the selfless dedication of militant leaders, she was among a dozen suffragettes, including Lady Constance Lytton, who resolved to undertake acts of violence in Newcastle on 9 November 1909 to protest against the forcible feeding of women prisoners. After attacking a barricade with a concealed axe as a symbolic revolutionary act, Jane Brailsford was taken into custody and sentenced to the second division for a month. As the wife of a notable journalist she received preferential treatment&#151;she was not forcibly fed&#151;and was released after three days of imprisonment. Arrested again during a WSPU demonstration on 21 November 1911, she was sentenced to seven days in the second division at Holloway prison. It was a propensity for impetuosity coupled with deep-seated frustration that led her to invest such energy in WSPU activity between 1909 and the end of 1912. Her yearning for a cause to which she could wholeheartedly commit herself and her ambition for notoriety were temporarily satisfied in franchise agitation.<br>
<br>When Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence were expelled from the WSPU in October 1912, Jane Brailsford resigned from the organization in disgust and quarrelled with her husband over militant tactics, to which he was opposed. She later suffered severe depression and a physical breakdown, possibly precipitating the uncontrolled drinking that blighted her later years. Regarding marriage as a form of subjugation, she never concealed her repugnance for her husband, whom she treated with contempt. At her insistence they had no children. In 1913 the Brailsfords parted, only to be reconciled temporarily a year later when they moved to Welwyn. In 1921 they separated permanently, although she refused to agree to a divorce. By the late 1920s Jane Brailsford, incapacitated by alcoholism, was living alone in Kew, London. She died on 9 April 1937 at 385 High Road, Chiswick, Middlesex, of pneumonia and cirrhosis of the liver.<br>
