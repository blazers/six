</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martin,  John</span>  (1812&#150;1875), <span class="occ">Young Irelander and politician</span>, was born at Loughorne, in the parish of Donaghmore, near Newry, co. Down, on 8 September 1812. He was the second of nine children of Samuel Martin (<i>d</i>. 1831), a gentleman farmer and linen manufacturer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harshaw (<i>d</i>. 1847). Like his parents, he was a Presbyterian throughout his life. He was educated at Dr Henderson's school at Newry, where he first met his lifelong friend John Mitchel, and subsequently at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in the summer of 1834. He then began to study medicine, but abandoned his course before taking a medical degree because his uncle, also called John Martin, died in 1835, leaving him a small property at Loughorne, with an annual income of &pound;400. He returned to Loughorne and the gentleman farmer and landlord was well liked among his tenants. In 1839 he travelled in America, and in 1841 visited the continent of Europe.<br>
<br>Martin became a member of the Repeal Association in 1844 and advocated a regular publication of accounts, but without effect. In 1846 he joined the secession of the Young Ireland party, and was expelled from the Repeal Association, having been refused a hearing in Conciliation Hall. He subsequently took a prominent part in the meetings of the Irish Confederation, and occasionally wrote for <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, mainly on agriculture. However, he continued to reside in Loughorne, because he was strongly attached to his area and the local community. He was a sincere, thoughtful, straightforward, and gentle person with a keen sense of humour. Together with Mitchel, he tried to convince Irish protestants of the benefits of an Irish parliament, and to recruit Ulster people into the Irish Confederation. When Mitchel established his own paper, the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>, in February 1848 Martin became a contributor to it, although the two friends did not always hold the same political views. Three weeks after the arrest of Mitchel and the seizure of his paper Martin reoccupied his friend's offices, and on 24 June 1848 issued from them the <span class="italic">Irish Felon</span>, a &#145;successor to the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>&#146;, with the avowed purpose of promoting the same principles which had been advocated in his friend's newspaper. A warrant for his arrest was issued and on 8 July Martin, who had kept out of the way until the adjournment of the commission which had been sitting in Dublin, surrendered himself to the police. From Newgate prison he wrote the letter which appeared, signed with his initials, in the fifth and last number of the <span class="italic">Irish Felon</span> (22 July 1848), in which he exhorted the people to keep their arms in spite of the proclamation, and declared that the work of overthrowing the English dominion in Ireland &#145;must be done at any risk, at any cost, at any sacrifice&#146;. On 14 August he was indicted for treason at the commission court in Green Street, Dublin. He was defended by Isaac Butt QC, Sir Colman O'Loghlen, Holmes, and O'Hagan. After a trial which lasted three days Martin was found guilty, and on 19 August he was sentenced by the lord chief baron to transportation overseas for ten years. The sentence came as a shock to his local community, where he was highly respected. He was shipped off to Van Diemen's Land in the <i>Elphinstone</i>, together with Kevin Izod O'Doherty, and arrived in November 1849. O'Doherty gave him the nickname John Knox. Martin resided in the district of Bothwell, where for some time he shared a cottage with Mitchel. In 1854 a pardon, on condition of his not returning to Great Britain or Ireland, was granted to him. He settled in Paris in October 1854, and in June 1856 received an unconditional pardon. However, he refused to live in Ireland again until 1858, when the sudden death of his brother Robert and his wife, Millicent, forced him to take up residence in Kilbroney, Rostrevor, to take care of his nephews and nieces. In January 1864 he established with O'Donoghue the National League, whose object was to obtain the legislative independence of Ireland. The league only lasted until 1867. Martin took a prominent part in the funeral procession through Dublin in honour of the &#145;Manchester martyrs&#146; on 8 December 1867, and delivered an address to an enormous crowd outside Glasnevin cemetery. For his share in these proceedings he was prosecuted by the government in February 1868, but owing to disagreement among the members of the jury any further attempt to obtain a conviction against him was abandoned. On 25 November 1868 he married Henrietta Mitchel (<i>d</i>. 1913), his friend's sister and the youngest daughter of the Revd John Mitchel and Mary Haslett, at Roslyn Hill Chapel, Hampstead, London. Henrietta, who had a similar political outlook, had also been involved in Young Ireland activities and had written articles for her brother's newspaper, the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>. They had no children.<br>
<br>While on a visit to America in December 1869, Martin was put forward as a candidate in the nationalist interest at a by-election for County Longford. The local clergy had, however, already pledged themselves to support R. J. M. Greville Nugent, the Liberal candidate, and Martin was defeated by 1578 votes to 411. In May 1870 Martin joined the Home Government Association for Ireland, and at a by-election for County Meath in January 1871 was returned to parliament as a home-ruler by a majority of 456 votes over his Conservative opponent, G. J. Plunket. He spoke for the first time in the House of Commons in May 1871 during the debate on the second reading of the <span class="roman">Protection of Life and Property (Ireland) Bill</span>, when he declared that he did not &#145;intend to vote upon this bill nor indeed upon any other measure which the parliament may think proper to pass in respect to the government&#146; of his country, and contended that it was &#145;the inalienable right of the Irish people to be a free people, and as a free people to be bound only by laws made by the queen and a free parliament of that kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 206.908&#150;14, 1039&#150;45). Martin was also involved in the formation of the Irish Home Rule League and was elected its secretary in 1874. In the same year he was again returned for County Meath at the general election in February 1874. Since he did not like to be paid for patriotic services, he resigned from his post of paid secretary, and accepted that of honorary secretary instead. He died on 29 March 1875 at Dromalane House, near Newry (the residence of Hill Irvine, Henrietta Mitchel's brother-in-law), from an attack of bronchitis caught while attending the funeral of John Mitchel. He was buried in the family plot at Donaghmore on 1 April.<br>
<br>Martin was a sturdy and uncompromising politician, whose sense of honour and candour earned him the affectionate nickname of Honest John Martin. His death paved the way for Charles Stewart Parnell to enter the House of Commons for the first time, as the next MP for County Meath.<br>
