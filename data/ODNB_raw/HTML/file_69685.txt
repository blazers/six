<span class="headword">Weiner,  Joseph Sidney</span>  (1915&#150;1982), <span class="occ">human biologist and environmental physiologist</span>, was born on 29 June 1915 at Nourse Mines in Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa, the second of the seven children of Robert Weiner (1885&#150;1966), general dealer, and his wife Fanny (Chana), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simon (1896&#150;1978), Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. After attending the East Central School and the boys' high school (1927&#150;31) at Pretoria he went to the University of Witwatersrand medical school, Johannesburg (1932&#150;6), being awarded an MSc in physiology in 1937, in which year he moved to Great Britain. He married Marjorie Winifred Daw (1912&#150;2003) in 1943; they had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>Weiner obtained the degree of PhD from the University of London in 1946, and was admitted LRCP and MRCS from St George's Hospital, London, in 1947; he was made DSc of Oxford University in 1971. He was successively demonstrator in the department of applied physiology in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1940&#150;41); scientific member of the Medical Research Council (MRC) unit at Queen Square (1942&#150;6); reader in physical anthropology at Oxford University (1945&#150;63) and honorary deputy director of the MRC climate and working efficiency unit (1955&#150;63); director of the MRC environmental physiology unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1963&#150;80); and professor of environmental physiology at London University (1965&#150;80).<br>
<br>Weiner came to public attention in November 1953 when he, K. P. Oakley, and W. E. Le Gros Clark announced the exposure of the Piltdown forgery [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59597/', "Piltdown Man")</script>]. Oakley's 1949 fluorine tests had suggested that the mandible and skull cap of the enigmatic Piltdown Man (<i>Eoanthropus dawsoni</i>), the English &#145;missing link&#146; discovered in 1912, were of late Pleistocene age, and that all the fragments might belong to one individual. Weiner found it extraordinary that a composite &#145;man-ape&#146; could have existed in England at this date, and was puzzled by the circumstances of the discovery. He began to investigate seriously the possibility that the so-called fossil was a fraud. Using modern chimpanzee teeth, he showed Le Gros Clark and Oakley how the molar teeth might have been deliberately filed and all the materials superficially stained. Oakley then confirmed that the Piltdown materials in the British Museum had indeed been artificially abraded and stained, and on repeating the fluorine test, found that the skull and jaw were of different dates (the jaw being that of a modern orang-utan). A battery of further tests, including X-ray crystallography, clinched the case. The story of the exposure and Weiner's investigation of the forger (whom he believed to be the discoverer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37347/', "Charles Dawson")</script>) is told in his book <span class="italic">The Piltdown Forgery</span> (1955; republished 1980). His removal of Piltdown Man from the palaeontological record decisively clarified the sequence of human evolution, largely in accord with the Darwinian hypotheses.<br>
<br>Weiner was first and foremost an experimental physiologist; starting from his MSc thesis on the effects of heat on workers in the Rand mines in 1935&#150;6, he specialized in the mechanism of sweating and human adaptation to environmental temperature variation. Approximately 100 of his 290-odd publications deal with aspects of human physiology, culminating in the authoritative <span class="italic">Principles and Practices of Human Physiology</span> (with O. G. Edholm, 1981). He contributed extensively to applied physiology, carrying out defence research during the Second World War, assisting in the establishment of the science of ergonomics (he was a founder of the Ergonomics Research Society), and advising the coal and steel industries in Britain and the EEC.<br>
<br>The post-war development of physical anthropology was transformed by Weiner's appointment to the Oxford readership in 1945. He soon assumed a leading role in the movement to establish human biology as a discipline studying human beings at the population level, integrating genetics, demography, ecology, physiology, experimental anatomy, and evolutionary theory. He was a founder, in 1958, of the Society for the Study of Human Biology, and later of the International Association of Human Biologists. Weiner and his colleagues G. A. Harrison, J. M. Tanner, and N. A. Barnicot co-authored the landmark textbook <span class="italic">Human Biology: an Introduction to Human Evolution, Variation, and Growth</span> (1964). He served as president of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1963&#150;4) and published about 120 anthropological papers, including studies of both fossil hominids and living populations. He summarized his understanding of human evolution and variation in <span class="italic">Man's Natural History</span> (1971; also published in French, Spanish, German, and Italian). He led field expeditions in South and South-West Africa in 1958 and 1961 to investigate the affinities of the Khoi and San peoples; his work on the region is encapsulated in the last book to which he contributed, <span class="italic">Peoples of Southern Africa and their Affinities</span> (with G. T. Nurse and T. Jenkins; 1985). He was largely responsible for the establishment and administration (as world convenor, 1962&#150;74) of the human adaptability section of the International Biological Programme, on the basis of which thousands of research projects were undertaken worldwide; these were reported in his <span class="italic">Human adaptability: a history and compendium of research in the international biological programme</span> (with K. J. Collins, 1977). It was said of him:<blockquote>Professor J. S. Weiner has pioneered the modern holistic approach to the study of man; more than anyone else he is responsible for the transformation of physical anthropology from a dry and dusty academic byway &hellip; to its present focal position in the human sciences. (Harrison, review, 504)</blockquote>Weiner was noted for his tireless scientific activity, his power of distinguishing significant from trivial research, his ability to bring out the full potential of groups of researchers, and his generosity, especially to younger colleagues. A sympathy for scientific humanism took the place of religious belief for most of his life. Between 1941 and 1944 he was active in the Association of Scientific Workers, which aimed to improve the condition of scientific workers, and also with increasing the scientific input to the war effort. Like many intellectuals, he believed that only the Left could defeat Nazism and bring in a new era of science-based democracy. Constantly travelling, he particularly enjoyed literature, theatre, history, music, and gardening. Weiner died from lung cancer on 13 June 1982 at his home, 20 Harbord Road, Oxford. He was cremated at Oxford four days later.<br>
