<span class="headword">Manley,  Gordon</span>  (1902&#150;1980), <span class="occ">geographer and meteorologist</span>, was born on 3 January 1902 at Douglas on the Isle of Man, the son of Valentine Manley, a chartered accountant. He grew up in Lancashire and was educated at the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Blackburn. From the age of twelve he took meteorological readings in the countryside around his home. He went to Manchester University in 1918 to read engineering, graduated in 1921, and proceeded to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to read geography. He gained a double first in 1923. At Cambridge he studied under Frank Debenham, who inspired his interest in high-altitude environments. He obtained employment in the Meteorological Office in 1925 and was stationed at Kew observatory, but in the following year he accepted an assistant lectureship in geography at Birmingham University. In the same year he also accompanied the Cambridge expedition to east Greenland. There he undertook gravitational measurements which formed the basis of his earliest publications.<br>
<br>The foundations of Manley's career were now established. His training at Manchester in an applied science and his keen geographical interest were focused through his experience of scientific instrumentation, which was refined in Greenland and at Kew, where he also first encountered long meteorological records. In 1928 he was appointed to establish geography as a degree subject at Durham University. He remained at Durham until 1939. While there he married, in 1930, Audrey Fairfax Robinson, the daughter of Arthur Robinson, master of Hatfield College. They had no children.<br>
<br>At Durham, Manley began his work on the British climate which became the distinguishing feature of his scholarship. His research developed two related themes. Field observations concentrated on the climate of upland Britain. In 1932 he began to collect data on Cross Fell in the northern Pennines and in 1938 he established a meteorological station close to the summit of Dun Fell. At the same time he began to analyse historic meteorological records. He was curator of the Durham University observatory between 1932 and 1937 and published an account of the observatory's lengthy meteorological records in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</span> in 1941. In 1939 Manley moved back to Cambridge as a university demonstrator in geography. This involved him almost immediately in teaching responsibilities shaped largely by the war, including service short courses and teaching shared with the geography department of Bedford College, evacuated from London from 1939 until 1944. He remained at Cambridge throughout the war, serving as an officer of the university air squadron and widening his research interests to embrace global climatic change and palaeoclimatology. He gave the Symons memorial lecture to the Royal Meteorological Society in 1944, and his title, &#145;Some recent contributions to the study of climatic change&#146;, gives a clear indication of the focus of his research.<br>
<br>By the end of the war Manley's academic standing was established among both geographers and meteorologists. He was president of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1945&#150;7 and was awarded the Murchison grant of the Royal Geographical Society in 1947. In the immediate post-war years his publications began to indicate his widening interests, beyond the British Isles and into a more distant past affected by the glacial climates of the Pleistocene.<br>
<br>Manley was appointed to a university lectureship at Cambridge in 1947, but in 1948 he accepted the newly established chair of geography at Bedford College in the University of London. Here &#145;he was welcomed as an entertaining lecturer and for his genial personality and friendly manner with staff and students alike&#146;  (Lamb). At this time he was a member of committees of the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Air Ministry, and also of the British national committee for the international geophysical year. His research publications remained prolific and included his important and meticulous work on historic temperature records for central England for the period 1698&#150;1952, which he later extended to cover the period 1659&#150;1973, published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</span> in 1953 and 1974 respectively. His memory for the details of this and other meteorological records was prodigious. He also reached a wider public through his book <span class="italic">Climate and the British Scene</span> (1952) and through his articles in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Of the latter, more than fifty appeared between 1954 and 1961, mostly concerned with the unpredictability of Britain's daily and seasonal weather.<br>
<br>In 1964 Manley was invited to found a department of environmental studies at the new University of Lancaster, and this occupied him until his retirement in 1967. In nurturing the departments at both Bedford College and Lancaster he was more concerned with quality than with scale. <i>Festina lente</i> was his motto. After retiring to Coton in Cambridgeshire he was a supporter of the village church there, and he remained active in research and writing until the end of his life. Between 1927 and 1981 he published more than 180 papers. He died on 29 January 1980 at Papworth Hospital, Papworth Everard, of heart failure, and was survived by his widow.<br>
<br>Manley was a pioneer in the study of climatic change. He showed how the weather and climates of the past could be reconstructed, sometimes in considerable detail, using data from many different sources. His own main interest was in the historic period with its written and instrumental archives, but he was fully aware of the climatic signal in the geological record and its significance for the more distant past. Seen in its historical context, his work provides part of the insight that has led to the study of such issues as global warming and has enabled palaeoclimatic research to focus on the causes of climatic change.<br>
