<span class="headword">Cox,  Harold</span>  (1859&#150;1936), <span class="occ">economist and journalist</span>, was born at Wimbledon on 16 August 1859, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51995/', "Homersham Cox (1821&#150;1897)")</script>, a county court judge, and his wife, Margaret Lucy Cox (<i>b</i>. 1832/3). He was educated at Tonbridge School, whence he obtained a mathematical scholarship at Jesus College, Cambridge. He was president of the union in 1881, and after graduating as a senior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1882, became a university extension lecturer in Yorkshire. After coming under the influence of Edward Carpenter, according to his own account he spent nearly a year working as an agricultural labourer in Kent and Sussex &#145;in order to gain an insight into the life of English labourers&#146;. From 1885 to 1887 he taught mathematics in the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh in India.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1887 Cox joined Gray's Inn and read for the bar. In 1890 he married Helen Clegg (1861&#150;1930). They had no children. Turning to politics, he was appointed secretary of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45600', "Cobden Club")</script> in 1899. In that position he took a prominent part in opposing the tariff-reform proposals of Joseph Chamberlain, and in maintaining the pure tradition of <i>laissez-faire</i> liberalism against Liberal as well as Unionist innovations. He resigned the secretaryship in 1904 and in recognition of his services to free trade he was adopted as candidate by the Liberal Party in Preston, and won the seat at the general election in 1906. Cox represented the old Liberalism of retrenchment, disliked old-age pensions and, even more, Lloyd George's budget of 1909. He began working with Unionist free-traders&#151;he had a connection with St Loe Strachey and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>&#151;and at the general election of January 1910 stood for Preston as a free-trade Liberal (Sir John Gorst being the official Liberal candidate); he came bottom of the poll. In 1911 he stood for Cambridge University at a by-election, again as a free-trade Liberal, but again without success; that ended his parliamentary career.<br>
<br>After his retirement from politics Cox constantly spoke and wrote against the growth of public expenditure and of bureaucracy. Although in early life he had been friendly with Sidney Webb, and had collaborated with him in a book, <span class="italic">Eight Hours Day</span> (1891), he was now an uncompromising opponent of socialism; his book <span class="italic">Economic Liberty</span> (1920) is a good exposition of old-style Liberal individualism. His public work included membership (1914&#150;15) of the inquiry into alleged German atrocities in Belgium, held under the chairmanship of Lord Bryce, and of the committee on public retrenchment (1916). From 1910 to 1912 he was an alderman of the London county council, and in 1913 he was elected an honorary fellow of Jesus College. On the death of A. R. D. Elliot in 1912, he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>; he held the post until 1929, when the journal ceased to be published, Cox lamenting: &#145;the political views that it was intended to support have ceased to play any leading part in the national life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 250, Oct 1929, 193). He moved from Gray's Inn to Old Kennards, Leigh, near Tonbridge, where he died, from broncho-pneumonia and myocardial degeneration, on 1 May 1936; he was cremated at Woking.<br>
