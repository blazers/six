<span class="headword">Daly,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1840&#150;1911), <span class="occ">political activist and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born in Boghadoon, co. Mayo, the son of a bailiff on the Elm Hall estate at Belcarra. He was educated by the Franciscan brothers at Errew monastery, near Castlebar, co. Mayo. A tenant and bailiff of estates in co. Mayo, and one in Kilkenny, he also rented property from the Lucan estate in Castlebar. By the end of the 1860s he had become an important figure in Castlebar as town councillor, poor-law guardian, and agent for Dublin-based firms. In 1876 he bought the <span class="italic">Connaught Telegraph</span>, an old-established Liberal newspaper, and became its editor and proprietor. He always regarded himself as a tenant farmer first and only by accident a newspaper proprietor.<br>
<br>Daly's initial involvement in local politics came in 1874 when he worked with members of the supreme council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood to elect John O'Connor Power to parliament. He went on to organize tenants' associations, saying that he had purchased the newspaper in order to agitate on behalf of small farmers against their landlords. Daly is best known for his part in organizing the meeting at Irishtown, co. Mayo, on 20 April 1879, which opened the land war and inaugurated the Land League of Mayo, the precursor of the Irish National Land League. Although the meeting was held at Daly's initiative, he was put under pressure by local Fenians. Daly later said that the meeting was held at the request of tenants, who had asked him to publicize a threatened eviction. Here Daly's position as a newspaper proprietor certainly helped him to mobilize local agitation. He co-operated with Michael Davitt, who organized the Dublin-based Fenians who took part, and Daly chaired the meeting; Davitt was not present. Daly was arrested with Davitt and James Bryce Killen at Gurteen, co. Sligo, in November 1879 for using seditious language; he had suggested that if anyone was evicted tenants should gather together and reinstate him. They were later released and the case was abandoned in January 1880. Dublin Castle believed him to be a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, but Daly was not a Fenian; he was a constitutionalist. With his background as a tenant farmer his knowledge of local conditions was immense. His evidence to the Bessborough commission inquiring into the operation of the <span class="roman">Land Acts</span> influenced their recommendations, and these in turn gave Gladstone the basis for the 1881 <span class="roman">Land Act</span>. Daly remained a local politician, not a national parliamentarian; he warned that agrarian outrage would lead to coercive legislation and fought a constant battle against the National League, whom he believed to be incompetent and corrupt, arguing that they acted against the interests of poor tenants. In 1889, at the special commission hearing, Davitt accused Daly of being the agent of a landlord to evict a tenant. This accusation Daly never forgave; he denounced Davitt for what he described as his &#145;crass ignorance&#146; of Mayo politics, and forced him to amend his account. Despite his position as a grazier, Daly continued to campaign for small farmers and evicted tenants against the large graziers. He supported Parnell in the general election of 1880, but had little faith in Westminster's legislation for Ireland.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1905), William O'Brien described Daly as &#145;A rough-spoken giant, with an inexhaustible fund of knowledge of the people&#146;  (p. 225). Because of his combative relationship with the leaders of the National League, he went unnoticed in their memoirs. Daly was married and had two daughters and a son, James. He died on 22 March 1911 in Castlebar, and was buried there in the Old Church cemetery.<br>
