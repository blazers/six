<span class="headword">Chubb, Sir  Lawrence Wensley</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">environmental campaigner</span>, was born at Lauraville, Victoria, Australia, on 21 December 1873, the eldest son of Lawrence Wensley Chubb JP, prospector and mine owner, of Copeland, New South Wales, and his wife, Esther Collins. He came to England in 1887 and completed his education in London at St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School and the Borough Polytechnic. His chief recreation was rambling. At the polytechnic debating society he attracted the attention of Octavia Hill and Robert Hunter; through them he was appointed in 1895 secretary of the Kent and Surrey committee of the Commons Preservation Society and in 1895 first secretary of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. Although young, Chubb was already remarkable for his discretion and tact as well as for his driving power and ability.<br>
<br>The countryside rather than buildings was Chubb's great love and in 1896 he resigned from the National Trust to become secretary of the Commons Preservation Society. The society (from 1899 the Commons and Footpaths Preservation Society and from 1910 the Commons, Open Spaces, and Footpaths Preservation Society) had been formed in 1865 to preserve as open space commons near to big cities. It gradually enlarged its remit to encompass the preservation of open space in general and its use for recreation by the general public. For over fifty years (until 1948) Chubb was largely responsible, as secretary, for the work of this body. Notable successes which were largely due to his efforts were the acquisition of the Kenwood estate, adjoining Hampstead Heath, for public recreation, and ensuring that footpaths and common land ploughed up during the wars in the drive to increase food production were restored to recreational use.<br>
<br>In addition to his work for the society Chubb played an important role in many individual schemes for preserving open spaces, such as the Hindhead Commons, Brockwell Park, and Box Hill. An early member of the Forest Ramblers, Chubb was instrumental in forming the Federation of Rambling Clubs in 1905 and this in turn became the Ramblers' Association, of which he was first secretary and later a vice-president. He was also, from 1915 to 1948, secretary of the Scapa Society for the Prevention of Disfigurement of Town and Country (later the Advisory Council for the Control of Outdoor Advertising); from 1928 to 1947 he was secretary of the National Playing Fields Association; from 1902 until 1929 he was secretary of the Coal Smoke Abatement Society, and in 1926 was an original council member of the Council for Rural Amenities, later the Council for the Protection of Rural England.<br>
<br>In the course of years Chubb acquired a quite unrivalled legal knowledge of the complex questions related to open spaces, footpaths, and public advertising, and was often consulted by local authorities and government departments. His unfailing tact made him invaluable in negotiation and on deputations to ministers, and he served on many committees concerned with such questions as open spaces, liaison between the Forestry Commission and amenity societies, the establishment of nature reserves and national parks, and the agricultural use of commons in wartime. He was knighted in 1930 for his services to the English countryside which continued almost to the end of his life.<br>
<br>There was a radical section among the rambling clubs (a fairly disparate bunch) which felt Chubb too ready for compromise and over reliant on painstaking legal work, and he was criticized for trying to do too many things; but this was not the opinion of those who saw the achievements of his tact, judicial temperament, and wide knowledge in the cause he had so deeply at heart. He published various pamphlets on public rights in the countryside and rambling guide books.<br>
<br>On 25 April 1905 Chubb married Gertrude Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1880/81), daughter of William Willers Anthony, of Southwark; they had a son, Lawrence Wensley, and a daughter, Gertrude Joyce. He died at their home, 35 Lichfield Court, Sheen Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 18 February 1948. A memorial seat was set up at the spot where Kenwood meets Hampstead Heath, commanding wide views of the countryside he secured for the public. His wife predeceased him.<br>
