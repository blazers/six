<span class="headword">Despagne <span class="st"> [D'Espagne]</span>,  Jean <span class="st"> [John]</span></span>  (1591&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Reformed minister and theologian</span>, was born in Mizo&euml;n, Dauphin&eacute;, France, one of several children of Henri D'Espagne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1626), protestant pastor there and subsequently at Bourg d'Oisans. His will placed the beginning of his ministerial career about 1611, but he seems to have been ordained in 1617. His first charge was at Orange in Dauphin&eacute;, but in 1620 he became a pastor at The Hague. In 1629, however, he was excluded from every pulpit in the Netherlands, possibly in the wake of unproven but still damaging allegations of sexual immorality, possibly because, as a staunch Calvinist, he had spoken out too forcefully against Arminianism, or possibly because he had politically embarrassed the prince of Orange by an ill-timed denunciation of Louis XIII and Richelieu's campaign against the Huguenots at La Rochelle.<br>
<br>Despagne went to England, where he had or soon found alternative patrons. He may already have formed a connection with Horace Vere, Lord Vere, commander of English forces in the Netherlands. Just before leaving The Hague he published a treatise on ecclesiastical ceremonial and its historical evolution into superstition, <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des anciennes c&eacute;r&eacute;monies</span> (1629), dedicated somewhat inappropriately to Charles I. In 1630 he wrote in French to Dudley Carleton, Viscount Dorchester (from 1626 to 1628 envoy to The Hague, but by this time secretary of state), requesting an introduction to the king and &#145;a little benefice or prebend of moderate revenue&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1625&#150;49</i>, 392) in order to fund books and research assistance for a major scholarly work. Perhaps this was <span class="italic">Antiduello &hellip; the Lawfulnesse and Unlawfulnesse of Single Combats</span>, published in 1632 both anonymously and under his name: this topical exploration of royal authority over duels exhibited a surprising knowledge of English history and probably rested on the services of a translator. More likely the subsidy was for a theological project, of which the first manifestation, <span class="italic">Les erreurs populaires &hellip; qui concernent l'intelligence de la religion</span>, appeared at The Hague in 1639: the English translation, <span class="italic">Popular Errors</span> (1648), referred in its dedication to &#145;king Charles&#146; to a command &#145;from the deceased king&#146; (James I unless the date is actually February or March 1649, in which case the address is daringly royalist) for &#145;the Manuscript which was the first fruits of my Pen&#146;.<br>
<br>Despagne spent a year in the Netherlands from about 1636 and continued to publish at The Hague, but seems to have made England his home for most of the 1630s, becoming chaplain to Benjamin de Rohan, duc de Soubise, the Huguenot military leader in exile. His attractive preaching and effective writing, evident in <span class="italic">La manducation du corps de Christ</span> (1640), an exposition of eucharistic doctrine which combined a reverence for the sacrament with orthodox Calvinist theology, won him the approval of Gilbert Primrose, one of the ministers of the French church in Threadneedle Street, London. However, Soubise's influence was insufficient to prevail against the hostile reaction of other members of the consistory and to secure Despagne a pastorate there. Following the duc's death in 1642, Despagne served briefly as pastor at the French church at Sandtoft, Lincolnshire. On his return to London the Threadneedle Street consistory complained to the House of Lords about his &#145;unauthorised&#146; preaching, but the latter concluded on 21 January 1643 that his sermons delivered at the house of Lady Annandale (presumably Elizabeth Shaw, widow of John Murray, first earl of Annandale) were &#145;rather an Advantage than any Inconvenience&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 5.566) and declined to silence him.<br>
<br>As before Despagne had well-placed patrons. Within a few months he was preaching to a congregation at Durham House, the London residence of Philip Herbert, earl of Pembroke. It prospered, attracting the social and intellectual &eacute;lite among French (and English) residents of Westminster who found it geographically convenient and personally congenial, but drew the enmity and envy of the divided and less financially favoured official City church. As early as December 1643 the Threadneedle Street consistory requested from their Amsterdam equivalent a copy of the 1629 proceedings against Despagne. Their reiterated complaints that he was splitting their congregation were finally formalized in 1646, when Despagne was formally pronounced schismatic and his adherents barred from attending communion at the City church.<br>
<br>Apparently little affected, Despagne continued to publish. Works on the creed, the Lord's prayer, the ten commandments, and other cornerstones of Christian doctrine with dedications to Pembroke and (once) to the House of Lords appeared regularly from 1646, first in French and rapidly translated by others into English. Between May 1648 and June 1650 John Egerton, second earl of Bridgewater, heard him preach four sermons and twenty-four catechitical expositions, the latter clear elucidations of Calvin, on whom he was a recognized authority. His sermons took a robustly moderate political line. <span class="italic">An Abridgement of a Sermon</span> (1648), preached on 12 September 1648, a fast day for the proposed treaty between king and parliament, stressed their mutual duties and mutual faults and exhorted &#145;both sides [to] endeavour to out-goe one another in benignitie, honour and pietie&#146; in order to &#145;restore the Church to its lustre, to the Lawes their vigour, to the Common-weal an happy peace&#146;  (p. 21). In March 1648 parliament had employed him to translate into French the declaration of the houses in answer to the Scots' papers on addresses to the king.<br>
<br>Pembroke's death on 23 January 1650 left the Durham House congregation secure: in his funeral sermon Despagne celebrated &#145;nostre Philippe&#146;, a reliable and responsive benefactor who had carefully left the church in the care of his son. That year he ordained his disciple Th&eacute;odore Crespin to serve a secessionist wing of the French church at Canterbury, and in January 1651 he tried unsuccessfully to set up a colloquy with the churches at Sandtoft and Southampton rivalling the authority of that of London. Such controversial activities hampered attempts by the Westminster congregation to reach a compromise with their London co-religionists late the same year, but helped by members of the council of state and others Despagne's flock moved in 1653 to the chapel of the Savoy at Somerset House. This became their permanent home and the basis of the future conformist French church of London, using in time the translated liturgy of the prayer book. Early members such as Isaac de Caus (<i>d</i>. 1648), the designer and architect, and Nicholas Briot (<i>d</i>. 1646), the engraver, and later members such as the physicians Sir Th&eacute;odore Turquet de Mayerne, Jean Colladon, and Th&eacute;ophilus de Garenci&egrave;res point to a conservative political outlook, and the fact that the diarist John Evelyn worshipped there is suggestive. Yet Despagne retained favour under the protectorate and was in tune with its intellectual cutting edge. His <span class="italic">Shibboleth ou r&eacute;formation de quelques passages &hellip; de la Bible</span> (1653) was dedicated to Oliver Cromwell, and in April 1657 the council of state approved an augmentation of his salary. His <span class="italic">Examen de XVII maximes judaiques</span> (1657) (dedicated to Edward Lawrence, son of John Lawrence, lawyer and sometime MP), <span class="italic">Essay des merveilles de Dieu</span> (1657) (dedicated to John Holles, earl of Clare and son-in-law of Lord Vere), and <span class="italic">The Joyfull Convert</span> (1658) reveal debate with Jewish scholars and an interest in cabbalism.<br>
<br>This context both nurtured the continuing hostility of the Threadneedle Street church to Despagne and ensured his survival unscathed. The most devastating attack on him yet was mounted by &#145;Guillaume Herbert&#146;, sometimes identified as a scion of Pembroke's family but from his own remarks more probably not English, in <span class="italic">R&eacute;ponse aux questions de Mr Espagne, address&eacute;es &agrave; l'eglise fran&ccedil;oise de Londres</span> (1657). Furious insults of the perceived schismatic and crypto-Catholic&#151;a wolf, fox, calumnist, &#145;Pape de Somerset&#146;  (p. 46), &#145;Romane ridicule&#146;  (p. 64)&#151;are accompanied by quotation from damagingly vivid testimonies in the 1629 adultery case supplied by the Amsterdam consistory. The synodical verdict of unproven should be, says Herbert, a source of shame and regret: Despagne is in effect a moral bankrupt.<br>
<br>By November 1658 Despagne was ill and the Savoy elders asked their Threadneedle Street brothers to supply a substitute preacher. He died on 25 April 1659, aged sixty-eight, and was probably buried in the Savoy Chapel, as he had wished; Garenci&egrave;res supplied an admiring epitaph there. Although Haag mentions a funeral sermon for his wife delivered on 31 October 1647, there is no trace of this or of a marriage; one of Herbert's complaints was that he was a hedonistic childless bachelor. In his will dated 13 April 1659 Despagne named as his heirs his two sisters in Dauphin&eacute;, Suzanne and Magdalen, and their families. His executor, Henry Browne, oversaw at least one of the many subsequent editions of Despagne's works. In the preface to <span class="italic">An Essay of the Wonders of God</span> (1662) Browne explained that he had frequented Despagne's chapel &#145;to be a partaker of those excellent Sermons and Doctrines of our Author, who was then followed by many of the Nobility, and the best of the Gentry, who rendered both to God and Ceasar their due&#146;; as an ode by Garenci&egrave;res in the same volume proclaimed, he was the &#145;Belle lumi&egrave;re des Pasteurs&#146;.<br>
