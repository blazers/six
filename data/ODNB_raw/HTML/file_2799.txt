<span class="headword">Bolron,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1665&#150;1682), <span class="occ">informer and perjurer</span>, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Apprenticed to a jeweller in London, he left after a year to become a foot soldier at Tynemouth Castle. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665&#150;7) he served on a frigate. In 1674 Sir Thomas Gascoigne of Barmbow Hall, Yorkshire, appointed Bolron manager of his colliery. Bolron wed Mary Baker, Gascoigne's former servant, in July 1675, and leased the farm of Shippon Hall (in Barwick in Elmet) from him. Retrospectively depicting himself as a gentleman in 1680, Bolron then claimed to have an annual income of &pound;30 from a coal farm, &pound;10 from a lime kiln, and &pound;7 from his farm. He embezzled &pound;240 from Gascoigne and falsified his accounts, for which Sir Thomas dismissed him in 1678 and obtained bonds for repayment of some of the money. Bolron allegedly endeavoured to persuade one of Gascoigne's servants to steal the bonds as well as his money, but without success. Sir Thomas ejected Bolron from Shippon Hall in June 1678 when his rent was in arrears.<br>
<br>Seeking revenge as well as relief from his debts, Bolron, inspired by the tales of the Popish Plot, went to a local cleric and then a justice of the peace with accusations that Gascoigne had schemed to assassinate Charles II. Bolron repeated his story to Sir Robert Clayton on 3 July 1679 and the earl of Shaftesbury the following day. On 30 May of that year, he claimed, the priest William Rushton and Sir Thomas had tried to enlist him in their plot, promising him &pound;1000. For material considerations, he averred, he had converted to Catholicism in 1675 and had often attended Catholic meetings at which Sir Thomas insisted that the Catholics were resolved to overthrow Charles. Around early 1676, Bolron charged, Gascoigne had sent &pound;3000 to Jesuits in London and &pound;50 to Catholics on the continent. He also accused Sir Thomas of holding a meeting at his house in the spring of 1677 to establish a nunnery near Ripley in preparation for the reconversion of England to Catholicism. Bolron implicated numerous priests as well as such laity as Sir Miles Stapleton and Viscount Molyneux. The council dispatched Bolron and several messengers to Yorkshire to arrest some of the accused. For the necessary second witness Bolron recruited Lawrence Mowbray, who had been dismissed as Sir Thomas's servant after allegedly stealing from his daughter, Lady Tempest. Both men testified at the trial of Gascoigne, now deaf and unwell, in February 1680, but their credibility was successfully impugned and the jury acquitted Sir Thomas.<br>
<br>Bolron publicized his accusations in a narrative the same year and, with the approval of the House of Commons, in a sensational account of an oath to murder Charles and root out protestantism in England, reputedly administered to Bolron in February 1677 by Rushton. Bolron's testimony against Stapleton and Lady Tempest was also insufficient to procure convictions, but the priest Thomas Thwing was not so fortunate, and was executed in October 1680. In the pay of Titus Oates and the whig attorney Aaron Smith, Bolron testified on behalf of Stephen College in August 1681. He also accused the JP Edmund Warcup of attempting to suborn him to accuse leading whig peers of having solicited him to charge the duke of York and the queen with complicity in the Popish Plot.<br>
<br>By 1 September 1681 Bolron had placed his services at the disposal of the tories after being charged with falsely accusing the crown witnesses Warcup and John &#145;narrative&#146; Smith of subornation, the latter in College's trial. He now accused assorted whigs of attempting to suborn him, including Aaron Smith, Peter Norrice, John Ayloffe, Edward Norton, Edmund Everard, and Robert Murray. As a crown witness, Bolron received an allowance of 40<i>s</i>. per week, but when this ceased in the latter part of 1682, Lawrence Mowbray charged that Bolron was claiming the court had urged him falsely to accuse Shaftesbury and his supporters of conspiracy. No more is known of him after 1682. Described by Sir Robert Southwell in 1679 as &#145;a young yeomanlike fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 4.530), Bolron had learned from Oates, whom he personally knew, how to profit by selling his inventive, malicious tales.<br>
