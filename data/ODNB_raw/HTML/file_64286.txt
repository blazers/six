<span class="headword">Woolmer,  Alfred Joseph</span>  (1805&#150;1892), <span class="occ">literary and historical genre painter</span>, was born on 20 December 1805. Nothing is known of his parents or about his education. Although his place of birth is usually identified as Exeter (a historic seat of the Woolmer family), census records list his birthplace as Chelsea, Middlesex. At the age of twenty-two he began contributing to exhibitions of the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and the recently formed Society of British Artists, to which he was elected a member in 1841. For the next decade this exceptionally prolific artist exhibited ten to sixteen pictures with the society each year, in addition to contributions elsewhere. These numbers halved from 1853 and declined to two or three a year from 1875. Nevertheless, his sixty-year career yielded a total of 355 works exhibited with the society, forty-five with the British Institution, and twelve at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Woolmer's paintings embody the concept of <i>ut pictura poesis</i>. Although he often illustrated specific incidents from favourite writers&#151;chiefly Shakespeare, Byron, Milton, and Tennyson&#151;he concentrated on evoking the mood of his literary and historical subjects. Suffused with a nebulous atmosphere suggestive of nostalgia and romance, his pictures rely on exotic costumes, quaint manners, and sumptuous settings to conjure the enchantments of imagined worlds. In formulating his rich, painterly style, he culled lessons from an eclectic array of past artists, some studied on the continent, others at old master exhibitions held annually in London. One such exhibition in the summer of 1832 provided the subject of an uncharacteristically realistic painting, <span class="italic">Interior of the British Institution</span> (Yale U. CBA). Woolmer offered self-conscious tributes to influential precursors in more fanciful paintings such as <span class="italic">Rembrandt's Studio</span> (ex Christies, London, 16 May 1962) and <span class="italic">Titian Contemplating Colour</span> (ex Lowndes Lodge Gallery, London, May 1968). He was best-known for sensuous, mildly erotic images of ladies at their <i>toilette</i> and for elegant courtship scenes set in light-dappled gardens and shady bowers. Although inspired by Antoine Watteau, such imagery also links him with the English vogue for romantic historical costume pieces initiated in the 1820s and 1830s. Woolmer scouted out striking scenic effects during sketching trips to Scotland, northern Wales, the Sussex coast, the Alps, Italy, and France. His predilections for rich impasto, the dissolution of form by light, and pyrotechnical meteorological phenomena generated a visionary style reminiscent of Turner or Samuel Palmer.<br>
<br>Conspicuous in both number and appearance, Woolmer's exhibition contributions were singled out for prominent critical notice during the 1850s and 1860s. Writers praised the splendour of his imaginative vision and technical facility but complained that he squandered his exceptional gifts by relying on splashy atmospheric effects to disguise cursory drawing and negligent finish. Many were perplexed by the lack of obvious meaning in his more enigmatic subjects. His copious output supports the charge of hasty work, but critical demands for clarity of subject and execution were inappropriate in view of his intentions. His rejection of narrative in favour of the evocation of mood, and his painterly concern with expressive brushwork and daring effects of light and colour, placed him at odds with contemporary art trends and help to explain his exclusion from official honours and monographic critical notice.<br>
<br>Woolmer changed residences frequently before moving in 1849 to Fortis Green, Finchley, Middlesex, where he remained until 1864. He then resided briefly in Holloway, finally settling at 9 Chester Road, New Highgate, from 1868 to 1875. Woolmer was married, though the identity of his wife is unknown, and the Miss Marion Woolmer who exhibited five pictures at the Society of British Artists was presumably his daughter. In 1875 Woolmer moved to 34 Dartmouth Park Avenue, Kentish Town, where he died on 19 April 1892, six years after exhibiting his last picture. In light of his productivity, he left a surprisingly meagre estate.<br>
