<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pole,  Edmund  de la</span>, eighth earl of Suffolk  (1472?&#150;1513), <span class="occ">nobleman and claimant to the English throne</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22450/', "John de la Pole, second duke of Suffolk (1442&#150;1492)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Plantagenet (1444&#150;1503/4), sister of Edward IV. Nothing can be said of his early years (it was his older brother Edward, not Edmund as sometimes reported, who attended a theology lecture at Oxford in 1481 and was praised for his precocious scholarship), but the closeness of his links to the Yorkist kings brought Edmund election as a knight of the Bath at Richard III's coronation on 4 July 1483. Because of his youth he escaped involvement both in the dynastic change of 1485 and in the treason of his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22449/', "John de la Pole, earl of Lincoln")</script>, in 1487. Edmund seems to have been close to his cousin Queen Elizabeth, wife of Henry VII, and he is recorded many times at ceremonials held in the early years of Henry's reign, such as Elizabeth's coronation on 25 November 1487 and court entertainments and Christmas festivities, where he associated with other young nobles of Yorkist blood, such as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2988/', "Henry Bourchier, second earl of Essex")</script>, and Lord William Courtenay.<br>
<br>Edmund may however have resented his treatment at the hands of Henry VII following the death of his father in 1492, when he became the king's ward. Duke John had settled many manors on his eldest son and heir, and these were forfeited to the crown following Lincoln's attainder in 1487. As a minor, therefore, Edmund inherited the dukedom with a reduced income, and when he came of age in 1493 he did not possess sufficient wealth to maintain his status as a duke. As a compromise on 26 February 1493 he accepted the title of earl of Suffolk in exchange for licence by indenture to enter certain of Lincoln's estates as if no act of attainder had been passed, but only after paying &pound;5000 in yearly payments of &pound;200 during the life of his mother, and of &pound;400 after her death. This indenture may have marked the beginning of Suffolk's financial difficulties. After his own attainder in 1504, the revenue from his estates for 1503&#150;4 totalled some &pound;876, so the payments demanded for the recovery of Lincoln's manors represented a sizeable portion of Suffolk's annual income.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Suffolk remained loyal to the Tudor crown. In November 1492, during the invasion of France, he co-operated closely with the earls of Essex and Oxford at the siege of Boulogne. He took part in the jousting when Prince Henry was created duke of York at Westminster in November 1494, and in disguisings in 1496, and he entertained the king at Ewelme at Michaelmas 1495. In February 1496 he was among many English noblemen who stood surety to the Archduke Philip for the observance of the new treaties with Burgundy, and shortly afterwards he became knight of the Garter, replacing Henry VII's uncle Jasper, duke of Bedford, who had died in December 1495. In June 1497 Suffolk was sufficiently loyal to ignore Lord Bergavenny's suggestion that they both join Lord Audley and the Cornish rebels. He commanded royal forces under Oxford and Daubeney at the battle of Blackheath on 17 June 1497, and he was named to all the Norfolk and Suffolk commissions of the peace up to February 1501.<br>
<br>Once he was financially obliged to Henry VII after 1493, however, Suffolk began to feel greater pressure on his position within the Tudor regime. In 1498 and 1499 he appeared in king's bench over unspecified articles concerning his father's lands in Yorkshire, while in Michaelmas 1498 he was indicted for the murder of one Thomas Crue in the parish of All Hallows Barking by the Tower. Also involved were Suffolk's companions Lord William Courtenay, Thomas Neville, and William Brandon, all then of Westminster. Thomas Crue was reportedly the plaintiff in a case under discussion by Henry VII's council, and although the details are unclear, the king seems to have stopped proceedings at common law, perhaps in order to take political advantage of the vulnerable position of these lords of Yorkist descent. Francis Bacon would later suggest that Suffolk's refusal to accept the humiliating conditions under which Henry expected the earl to plead for pardon prompted his first flight abroad. On 1 July 1499 Suffolk travelled without licence to the lieutenant of St Omer, in Picardy, where he probably hoped for the assistance of another of his aunts, Margaret of York, dowager duchess of Burgundy. Sir James Tyrell, deputy to Lord Daubeney at Gu&icirc;nes, also seems to have offered help at that time.<br>
<br>On 20 September 1499 Sir Richard Guildford and Richard Hatton were dispatched to Brussels to negotiate with Philip the Fair for Suffolk's return. By threatening a trade embargo they secured the archduke's co-operation, and Suffolk was assured that his only hope of restitution lay in submission to Henry VII's terms. Immediately upon his return, therefore, Suffolk was obliged to place land in feoffment until &pound;1000 had been paid to the king. At the same time the earl of Oxford agreed to monitor the behaviour of Suffolk's wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1515), whom he had married before 10 October 1496. In October 1499 several of Suffolk's associates, and also Sir James Tyrell, were probably interrogated before the council for their part in the earl's temporary defection. Henry VII perhaps believed that by the beginning of 1500 clear warnings like these, along with the execution of the Yorkist figurehead the earl of Warwick on 24 November 1499, were sufficient to ensure Suffolk's loyalty. On 5 May 1500 he witnessed at Canterbury the ratification of the treaty for the marriage of Prince Arthur with Katherine of Aragon, and six days later followed the king to Calais for a meeting with Archduke Philip. He was reappointed to the Suffolk bench on 20 November 1500, but lawsuits over unlawful entry into land in Higham, Norfolk, and over the status of one William Ryvett whom Suffolk was claiming as his villein, were lost by 1501 (again after the involvement of the king's council), suggesting that the earl's exercise of authority continued to be frustrated within East Anglia. In August 1501 he again fled the country without royal licence, this time going with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22458/', "Richard de la Pole")</script> to the court of Emperor Maximilian, whom he hoped would support his claim to the English crown.<br>
<br>Suffolk waited at Imst for some time before his steward Thomas Killingworth was able to arrange financial support from Maximilian and the count of Hardeck. From a new base at Aachen, Suffolk began at the close of 1501 to plan for an invasion of England and a rising of his servants and supporters. Henry VII was aware of his plans, however, and by the end of the year the earl of Oxford had placed a number of Edmund's East Anglian tenants under bonds of allegiance to the crown. The king also mobilized a network of spies and informers, probably including Sir Robert Curzon and William Waldegrave, to infiltrate Suffolk's supporters at home and abroad. Edmund's brother William, Lord William Courtenay, and other friends who had remained in England were also imprisoned by 1502, Sir James Tyrell was executed, and Suffolk and his exiled companions were outlawed at Ipswich on 26 December 1502.<br>
<br>From that time onwards Suffolk was a rather pathetic figure and a pawn of international politics. In July 1502 Maximilian agreed by the treaty of Augsburg not to harbour English rebels within his territories. But although he took an oath to expel Suffolk on 12 February 1503, the emperor maintained the financially desperate earl at Aachen for several months further. Suffolk was attainted in parliament in January 1504, along with his brother Richard and his closest supporters, Thomas Killingworth, Sir John Wyndham, Thomas Wyndham, and Sir George Neville.<br>
<br>Suffolk's band of followers left Aachen at Easter 1504, with Richard de la Pole remaining behind as hostage for his brother's debts. There survive numerous letters written by Suffolk after 1504 which attest his increasing desperation and also a surprising lack of literacy. Edmund was heading for Friesland and the protection of Duke George of Saxony, when he was imprisoned by servants of the duke of Gueldres in Hattem Castle. Henry VII may have paid Gueldres to restrain Suffolk until negotiations could be completed with Archduke Philip for his return to England. It has been argued that the massive payments to Maximilian and Philip made in Henry VII's later years (Philip was &#145;lent&#146; &pound;138,000 in 1505) were intended to buy their co-operation against Yorkist conspiracy. Suffolk was transferred to the custody of Philip von Lichtenstein at Namur in October 1505, but he was evidently exhausted and disillusioned by his lack of support on the continent, and on 24 January 1506 he instructed two of his servants to negotiate with Henry VII for his return to England. This process was speeded by the chance arrival in England of Archduke Philip, now king of Castile, that same month. Having received an undertaking that his life would be spared, Suffolk was delivered to Henry VII at Calais and imprisoned in the Tower on 24 April 1506. He was omitted from the general pardon at Henry VIII's accession and lingered in prison until the prospect of foreign-backed Yorkist conspiracy again emerged when Richard de la Pole was recognized as king of England by Louis XII of France, and fought in his service against England in 1512. Edmund was finally executed on 4 May 1513, once it became clear that his brother had claimed the English crown in his own right. The Franciscan provincial was paid &pound;7 15<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. for his burial at Greyfriars without Aldgate in London later that month. He and Margaret, who lived until February 1515, had only one child, Elizabeth, who became a nun at the Minories without Aldgate in London.<br>
