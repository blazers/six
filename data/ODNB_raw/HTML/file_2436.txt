<span class="headword">Birch,  Thomas</span>  (1705&#150;1766), <span class="occ">compiler of histories and biographer</span>, was born on 23 November 1705 at Clerkenwell, the eighth of ten children of Joseph Birch (<i>c</i>.1667&#150;1730) and his wife, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1746). In 1700 his parents had moved from Birmingham to London, where Joseph was a coffee mill maker in St George's Court, Clerkenwell. Both Birch's parents were Quakers and he was educated at the school of fellow Friend John Owen in Hemel Hempstead from 1717, and, from 1719, at that of Josiah Welby at Turnbull Street, Clerkenwell. Having sought permission not to enter the family business Birch worked from 1722 as an usher in various schools including Owen's, where he entered a three-year agreement in 1723.<br>
<br>From about 1726 Birch appeared bent upon a career in the established church, abandoning his Quaker roots. He married Hannah, daughter of the Revd Cox, curate of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, in 1728. A son, Joseph, was born on 17 July 1729 but mother and son both died shortly thereafter and were buried in the cemetery of St James's, Clerkenwell. This occasioned Birch's first public literary production, a poem &#145;On the Death of a Beloved Wife&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Whitehall Evening Post</span> of 15 November 1729.<br>
<br>At St James's Birch was baptized on 15 December 1730, ordained deacon on 17 January 1731 and priest on 21 December 1731. In 1732 he was presented to the vicarage of Ulting in Essex through the patronage of Sir Philip Yorke, later Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. He also acted as tutor to one of the Yorke sons. (Birch's subsequent career was to depend crucially on Hardwicke family patronage.)<br>
<br>In 1732 Birch was appointed to the <span class="italic">General Dictionary, Historical and Critical</span>, an expanded version of the earlier English translation of Pierre Bayle's <span class="italic">Dictionnaire historique et critique</span>. Although he was one of three chief editors Birch undertook the vast majority of the new biographical entries in the ten-volume edition issued from 1734 to 1741. This work was not only a major achievement but also provided numerous contacts in the learned and scientific worlds from whom Birch gained help in his historical work. His election to the Royal Society on 20 February 1735 and to the Society of Antiquaries on 11 December 1735 owed much to these contacts. Separate historical works also grew out of the <span class="italic">General Dictionary</span>. First came <span class="italic">The Works of Mr John Greaves</span> (1737) followed by the complete collection of the works of John Milton (1738) and the massive seven-volume compilation of the state papers of John Thurloe (1742).<br>
<br>Under Hardwicke family patronage Birch gained a number of church appointments: the living of Llandewi Felffre in Pembrokeshire in 1743, the rectory of St Michael Woodstrett at Epsom in 1744, and the living of St Margaret Pattens and St Gabriel Fenchurch in 1746. Birch also took up <i>in absentia</i> the living of Debden, near Newport, Essex, in February 1761. He was elected president of Sion College in 1759. Birch neither performed onerous clerical duties nor pursued progressive preferment. As an absentee pluralist his literary employments were regarded as a fulfilment of his duties.<br>
<br>From 1735 Birch was the eyes and ears of first Lord Chancellor Hardwicke and then his eldest son, Philip Yorke (later Lord Royston and second earl of Hardwicke), reporting on court proceedings and debates in the houses of parliament for his patrons as well as attending to numerous miscellaneous duties. In 1741 Philip Yorke commissioned Birch to write him a weekly letter providing news of the London scene during Philip's absences. These letters, written to within a few days of Birch's death, give a sustained account of the literary, scientific, political, and military events of the time. Birch also worked on Philip Yorke's project <span class="italic">The Athenian Letters</span> (privately printed, 1741&#150;3). His own historical work continued, including <span class="italic">The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle</span> (1744), on which much of the work was done by the Revd Henry Miles, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth</span> (1754), <span class="italic">Lives and Characters of Illustrious Persons</span> (1747&#150;52), and <span class="italic">The History of the Royal Society of London</span> (1756&#150;7).<br>
<br>Birch served as secretary of the Royal Society from 25 January 1752 until November 1765. As part of the Hardwicke circle which exercised considerable influence in the society, Birch was placed at the hub of the London learned world. A major figure in the Society of Antiquaries, of which he had been director (1737&#150;47), he was also an elected trustee on the newly established British Museum. Much scientific business of the day passed across his desk for the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> but Birch himself contributed only five short communications. Their topics, including a Roman inscription and an account of earth tremors, constitute a typical contribution from a scholar keenly interested in, but not primarily devoted to, natural philosophical inquiry.<br>
<br>When not transcribing, collating, or compiling, Birch enjoyed convivial company. He had pursued the writer Elizabeth Carter in 1738&#150;9 without success and so continued the life of the widower. His gift for conversation and fund of information were widely appreciated. Samuel Johnson, according to Boswell, said: &#145;Tom Birch is as brisk as a bee in conversation; but no sooner does he take a pen in his hand, than it becomes a torpedo to him, and benumbs all his faculties&#146;  (Hill, 1.159). There were kinder estimates of Birch as a writer, but he was undoubtedly a compiler rather than a historian. His strength was the hard graft of collection and compilation, not interpretation or stylish exposition.<br>
<br>Birch died on 19 January 1766 after falling from his horse on the Hampstead Road. His friend Dr William Watson, who was called to him, diagnosed a stroke of apoplexy. Birch was buried in the chancel of St Margaret Pattens, Rood Lane, London, on 23 January 1766. He left his library and manuscripts to the British Museum and stipulated that the income from the residue of his estate be used to supplement the stipends of three under-librarians at the museum.<br>
