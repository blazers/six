<span class="headword">Astbury,  John</span>  (1688?&#150;1743?), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was probably the son of John Astbury (<i>b</i>. 1663) and Anna Hales (<i>d</i>. 1703). Uncertainty arises because there were several John Astburys in the Staffordshire Potteries at this time. John Astbury and Anna Hales had three other children, a daughter, Mary, and two sons, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1692) and Samuel (1699&#150;1781). Samuel was also a potter and married Elizabeth, the sister of Thomas Wedgwood, father of Josiah Wedgwood, and in 1744 was one of the witnesses to the deed of Josiah's pottery apprenticeship. The John Astbury with whom we are concerned may have married Ann, the union yielding five children: Margaret (1722&#150;1728), Anne (1725&#150;1728), Hannah, Joshua (1728&#150;1780), and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1730). Tradition holds that Astbury, along with Thomas Twyford, feigned idiocy to spy on the workings of the Elers' pottery at Bradwell Farm. Given his age at that time this story is unlikely to be true. Little is known of his training or education. It has been suggested that he was in a short-lived partnership with Twyford in Shelton from around 1709.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1728 John Fenton leased his potworks at Shelton for three years to a John Astbury whose name had appeared as a potter in Fenton's accounts since 1723. In 1736 Astbury took over the lease on the house and land. He operated the potworks until his death, after which his widow is recorded as paying the potworks rent. It was at this site that Astbury made the wares for which he is best known. Excavations by archaeologists from the City Museum, Stoke-on-Trent, on the site of the potworks have revealed fine red earthenware often with applied decoration in either local red clay or pipe clay, perhaps influenced by the demand for Chinese wares and the work of the Elers. These moulded sprigs have included lions, unicorns, flora, and fauna. The most notable were those commemorating Admiral Vernon's capture of Porto Bello from the Spanish in 1739. White clay was used to coat pots and in banded decoration. Further excavated finds include white salt-glazed stoneware and agate ware. Most of the wares were wheel-thrown but there was some evidence of slip casting with relief decoration and of lathe turning. Astbury has become a generic term for pottery figures made from brown and white clays under colourless lead glazes. It has been suggested that the production dates of the figures do not fully correspond with those of Astbury's productive period, therefore implying an incorrect attribution. &#145;Astbury&#146; is also used when referring to some tea wares produced in the manner of the early eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Astbury had been suggested as the discoverer of the whitening properties that flint could impart to earthenware but this is based on a story first published by Josiah Wedgwood. He is also alleged to have been the first Staffordshire potter to import white clay from Bideford, Devon. There are questions that remain unanswered but what cannot be doubted is that an Astbury was an important potter producing wares of a quality that assisted the improvement of the local industry. The master potter John Astbury may be the man of that name buried in the graveyard of St Peter ad Vincula, Stoke-on-Trent, and recorded as having died on 3 March 1743.<br>
