<span class="headword">Smith,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1674/5), <span class="occ">composer and singer</span>, was probably one of the first boys appointed to the Chapel Royal following the Restoration in 1660, but there seems to be no record of this or of his subsequent dismissal. James Clifford includes the texts of six anthems by Smith in his 1664 edition of <span class="italic">The Divine Services and Anthems</span>, describing him as &#145;one of the Children of his Majesties Chappel&#146;. There his contemporaries included Pelham Humfrey and John Blow. Smith seems to have turned his back on church music after leaving the Chapel Royal and by 1672 was writing music for the theatre. Clearly his talent was noted at court, for on 20 June 1673 he was admitted as a musician-in-ordinary without fee at the behest of &#145;Mr. [Thomas] Purcell&#146;. Such a move frequently led to a permanent salaried place and on 3 August 1674 Smith was sworn among the lutes and voices in place of Pelham Humfrey, who had died on 14 July. By 22 November 1675, he himself was dead.<br>
<br>In spite of his short career Smith was highly regarded as a composer. His precocious anthems for the chapel have not survived, but many songs from his theatre work of 1672 and 1673 were published by John Playford in <span class="italic">Choice Songs and Ayres</span> (1673), revised as <span class="italic">Choice Ayres, Songs, &amp; Dialogues</span> (1676). Three keyboard pieces by Smith were included by Matthew Locke in <span class="italic">Melothesia</span> (1673), but much of his instrumental music remains in manuscript (often in fragmentary state). At least one suite by Thomas Farmer and Smith was &#145;made in Oxford&#146; according to a note on the cover; others were probably intended for performance in the theatre or at court. Smith's suite entitled &#145;New Year's Day&#146; was perhaps written for the annual concert (with ode) given on 1 January in 1674 or 1675. His songs have a &#145;popular&#146; idiom which no doubt made them attractive to audiences of his day. In D'Urfey's <span class="italic">The Fool Turn'd Critick</span> (1678) a song is admired as the work of &#145;one Mr. Smith, and late Composer to the King's Play-house &hellip; a very Excellent Fellow &hellip; and one the Town Misses very much&#146;.<br>
