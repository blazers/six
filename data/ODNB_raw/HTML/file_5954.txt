<span class="headword">Collins,  Samuel</span>  (1735&#150;1768), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born in Bristol, the son of a clergyman. He first studied law before turning to miniature portraiture, and little is known about his artistic background or training. By the mid-1750s, however, he had a well-established miniature portrait practice in Bath.<br>
<br>Collins painted portraits on enamel and on ivory. In scale his work is close to that of Luke Sullivan and Nathaniel Hone. Their work is usually grouped together, and as miniaturists they form a significant part of what Graham Reynolds has called a &#145;modest school&#146; of miniaturists that worked in mainly provincial centres during the middle part of the eighteenth century  (Reynolds, <span class="italic">English Portrait Miniatures</span>, 109). Collins's style in watercolour on ivory closely resembles the work of his contemporary Gervase Spencer; both shared an understanding of the qualities of the ivory base and the watercolour medium. Collins allowed a considerable amount of ivory to show through the watercolour, particularly in the painting of the face. The shaded areas are done in greyish-brown and pale blue hatched lines. He used the technique of scratching through or scraping away areas of the watercolour, especially in the painting of hair and shadows, thereby giving strength to a portrait which was always relatively small. An example of this technique may be seen in <span class="italic">Portrait of a Young Girl</span> (Yale U. CBA). In developing the technique of painting in watercolour on ivory Collins had a lasting influence on his pupils, most importantly on Ozias Humphry and the next generation of miniaturists. His work is extremely fine and delicate and he enjoyed a very good reputation among his fashionable Bath clientele. He painted portraits of <span class="italic">George III</span> (exh. South Kensington Museum Exhibition, 1865), <span class="italic">Princess Amelia</span> (Pierpont Morgan collection, New York), and <span class="italic">The Second Viscount Gage</span>. His own portrait was painted by Gainsborough, an indication of his status and popularity as an artist. He was described in <span class="italic">Nollekens and his Times</span> as &#145;a man of gay and expensive habits&#146;  (Smith, 2.357). His extravagant behaviour led to financial difficulties and in 1762 he had to leave Bath and abandon his pupil Ozias Humphry, who took over his practice.<br>
<br>Collins went to live in Ireland and continued to have a successful career in Dublin painting miniatures on ivory. A writer in <span class="italic">Walker's Hibernian Magazine</span> referred to &#145;the celebrated Mr. Collins, few if any, excelled him in miniature painting; his drawing, colouring and touch were as perfect as in an oil portrait&#146;  (1, June 1771, 230). Usually critical of artists' work, Anthony Pasquin described him as &#145;one of the most perfect miniature painters that ever existed in the realm&#146;  (Pasquin, 28). Collins died of a fever at his home in Summer Hill, Dublin, in October 1768 and, according to the <span class="italic">Dublin Mercury</span>, was &#145;not only regretted by every artist and admirer of the arts, but by a numerous acquaintance&#146;  (27&#150;9 Oct 1768).<br>
<br>There is a certain amount of confusion in attributing work to Collins, as he had the same initials as Samuel Cotes (1734&#150;1818). The only difference between the execution of the initials is that Collins's are made up of smooth brushstrokes and Cotes's initials are made up of several strokes. Miniatures by Collins are in the following collections: the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin; Kenwood House (the Draper gift) and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the New Orleans Museum of Art (the Latter-Schlesinger collection); and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
