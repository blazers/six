<span class="headword">Briggs,  William</span>  (1839&#150;1919), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born at East Retford, Nottinghamshire, on 25 March 1839, the eldest son of William Briggs, stage-coach proprietor, and his wife, Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett. He attended the King Edward VI Grammar School in Retford, then, aged fifteen, went to Chesterfield to work for a telegraph company. He was transferred to Edinburgh in 1858, but a year later left the telegraph service and moved to Greenock to become an apprentice in a chemical works, probably that of John Poynter &amp; Sons, which had a reputation for generating the strong smells that wafted over the town. Leaving Greenock in 1860, he joined the British Asphalte Company in Glasgow, then the most important centre of the chemical industry in Scotland. He rose to become assistant manager at the company's Port Dundas works and in his spare time attended chemistry classes at Anderson's College. Having acquired a modest amount of capital, and with the assurance of further financial backing from his future brother-in-law, Archibald Smith, Briggs moved to Arbroath in 1865 to open a coal-tar distillation plant and asphalt works. Briggs married Jane Smith on 13 September 1866; they had three sons, William, James, and Archibald.<br>
<br>Arbroath was already a prosperous centre for the manufacture of linen textiles and sailcloth. Timber, pitch, and tar from the Baltic and North America, some of which was used in the local shipbuilding industry, were unloaded in its harbour. Although there was no coal in the immediate vicinity, it could readily be transported by sea from the Fife or Lothian coalfields. Moreover, Briggs contracted the local gas company to supply its waste tar, from which a wide range of products could be derived. Briggs's products were mainly used in the construction industry. He also imported, from Germany, France, and Italy, mastic rock asphalt to be laid on foundations, floors, and roofs, including those of farm buildings. Although Briggs displayed considerable energy and enterprise, the firm chiefly benefited from the Victorian building boom, notably the rapid expansion of the city of Dundee, where factory and housing construction proceeded apace during the second half of the nineteenth century. From modest beginnings the firm diversified its product range and grew to be one of the most important of its kind in the east of Scotland.<br>
<br>Briggs expanded the firm beyond Arbroath and in 1890 shifted its centre of operations to Dundee, opening subsidiary works at Kirkcaldy and at Ladybank in Fife. In addition to its trade in coal-tar products, the firm also manufactured and applied bituminous anti-corrosive compounds to iron and steel structures, especially in the shipbuilding industry; here again, given the rapid expansion of steel shipbuilding on the Clyde and elsewhere, Briggs was well placed to exploit the market for his specialized products. He also took a keen interest in the manufacture and use of concrete, on which he published a study in 1891. In 1900 the firm became a limited company with Briggs as managing director.<br>
<br>Briggs clearly had great skill and energy and built up a very successful enterprise in the chemical and related industries. Apart from his business interests, he was an enthusiastic amateur scientist, was actively involved in Liberal politics, and was a member of churches in Greenock, Glasgow, Arbroath, Dundee, and Pitlochry, where he served for over forty years as a sabbath school superintendent. His teaching services for the church were recognized by his appointment as a director of the Scottish National Sabbath School Union. Briggs retired in 1907 to Pitlochry, where he built a handsome villa, Torrdarach, and spent his time in church and philanthropic work. He died there on 9 May 1919, and was buried on the 12th in Arbroath. His wife had predeceased him. His estate was valued at &pound;14,451, a sum which suggests that the bulk of his assets had earlier been transferred to other members of his family.<br>
<br>The company expanded rapidly under the management of his sons, and in particular William Briggs (1869&#150;1961) and <a name="cosubject_50637"></a><span class="headword">James Alexander Briggs</span>  (1871&#150;1961)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Arbroath on 18 July 1871 and educated at Arbroath high school. The brothers greatly increased the number of depots and agencies for the firm's products in major seaports at home and abroad, and formed or acquired associated companies in Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and elsewhere. For thirteen years before the First World War, William looked after the firm's interests in Germany, supplying anti-corrosives to the shipbuilding industry. However, the firm's main driving force, after he became managing director on his father's retirement, was James. In the inter-war years he oversaw the company's greatest increase in productive capacity. Before 1930 bitumen had been imported from North America, but such was the demand for the company's products that an oil distillation and bitumen plant, the Camperdown refinery, was built near Dundee harbour. The products included diesel oil, lubricating oils, and various grades of bitumen. Clearly aware of the market potential of new developments in road transport, Briggs also initiated the manufacture of tarmacadam. As a result of these initiatives, the bulk of the company's work came from road-making products, although construction materials, such as roofing felts, damp courses, and electrical insulation compounds, remained important. Until his retirement from the chairmanship of the company in 1947, James Briggs headed one of the largest and most successful producers of road-making and construction materials in the United Kingdom. He died at 30 Farington Street, Dundee, on 12 May 1961, his wife, Lizzie Jane Logan Yule, having predeceased him.<br>
