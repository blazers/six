<span class="headword">Ramsay,  James</span>  (1786&#150;1854), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was the son of Robert Ramsay (1754&#150;1828) of Sheffield, a carver and gilder who later became a dealer in prints and plaster models. Thus Ramsay was brought up in an atmosphere of artistic activity, this being intensified when Francis Chantrey, then a precociously talented youth, became an apprentice to Ramsay's father in 1797. In the following year his father published two mezzotint portraits of well-known Sheffield men painted by the Chesterfield artist E. Needham. The engravings were produced by John Raphael Smith and, possibly influenced by Needham and Smith, Ramsay became attracted to a career in art himself. By the age of fifteen, when he joined the family business, he was already a talented artist, his father announcing in <span class="italic">The Iris</span> (Sheffield), on 12 February 1801, that the services of &#145;Ramsay Junior&#146; were available as a &#145;Portrait and Miniature Painter&#146;. In 1803 Ramsay left Sheffield, taking with him a self-portrait, and, after showing it to an old friend of his father, Robert Pollard, in London, was successful in having it accepted by the Royal Academy. He was then only seventeen and, uncertain of his future in London, returned to Sheffield on a number of occasions over the next four years for what he advertised locally as &#145;short stays&#146;. He was probably the James Ramsey who entered the Royal Academy Schools in March 1805 when his age was given as twenty-one. However, he soon established himself as a successful portrait painter in London, and three years after his first arrival there exhibited at the Royal Academy a portrait of Henry Grattan which was engraved in mezzotint by Charles Turner; in 1810 one of John Townley, and in 1813 that of Lord Brougham. In 1814 at the Royal Academy he varied his exhibits for the first time by showing two scriptural subjects: <span class="italic">Peter Denying Christ</span>, and <span class="italic">Peter's Repentance</span>, and in 1819 sent views of Tynemouth Abbey, and of North and South Shields. He also exhibited at the British Institution and the Society of British Artists. His main work for the remainder of his life, however, was portraiture of well-known people. One of the most notable of these was his friend and fellow artist Thomas Bewick, of whom he painted at least three portraits; the earliest of these was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1816 and engraved by John Burnet (National History Society of Northumbria, Newcastle); the remaining two at the Royal Academy in 1823. One of these 1823 exhibits showed Bewick alone (NPG); the other consisted of a group portrait including Ramsay and his wife (Laing Gallery, Newcastle). His other sitters included James Northcote RA and Charles, second Earl Grey (1824). Although he once contemplated practising as a portrait painter in Scotland following the death of Raeburn  (letter to Reid, the Leith bookseller, quoted by Jane Bewick in a letter to her brother Robert Elliott Bewick, 12 Aug 1823, Huntington MSS HM 17315), Ramsay remained based in London for some forty years. In 1848, however, he decided to move with his wife to practise in Newcastle upon Tyne, a town with which he had long been connected through his several portrait commissions in the north-east of England, his friendships with brother artists in the area, and his regular appearances at various exhibitions there. He continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy while at Newcastle, showing several portraits of local celebrities, including George Hawkes, first mayor of Gateshead (1848), and William Armstrong (1854). He died after a long illness, at 40 Blackett Street, Newcastle, on 23 June 1854. Examples of Ramsay's work are in the Carlisle Art Gallery, Hull Art Gallery, and Newcastle Central Library, and in the collections of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle and the Natural History Society of Northumbria.<br>
