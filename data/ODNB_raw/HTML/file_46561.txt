<span class="headword">Newmarch <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jeaffreson]</span>,  Rosa Harriet</span>  (1857&#150;1940), <span class="occ">writer on music</span>, was born at 29 Lansdowne Place, Leamington Spa, on 18 December 1857, the daughter of Samuel John Jeaffreson, a doctor, and his wife, Sophy Kenney, and the granddaughter of the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15405/', "James Kenney")</script>. On 19 June 1883 she married Henry Charles Newmarch, a surveyor; they had a daughter, Elsie, and a son, John. All her work appeared under her married name. In 1897 she made the first of many visits to Russia, the country of whose music, together with that of Czechoslovakia, she was to pioneer English appreciation. Working in the Imperial Public Library in St Petersburg under the supervision of Vladimir Stasov, she made herself familiar with Russian music, and in England put her energy and enthusiasm into awakening a wider interest in Russian composers with a long series of lectures, books, articles, and programme notes. She also translated a number of Russian operas for English performance. A close friend of Sir Henry Wood, she encouraged performance of Russian music at the Proms, and became an eloquent advocate of it in her capacity as official programme-note writer to the Queen's Hall Orchestra between 1908 and 1919 (her work continued to appear until 1928).<br>
<br>Mrs Newmarch's last visit to Russia was made in the summer of 1915. When political events made further travel difficult, she turned her attention to the music of the Czech lands. Her writings had already aroused much appreciation among Czech musicians, and she was invited to the country, with her daughter, as a gesture of thanks by the conductor and composer Karel Kova&#345;ovic in 1919. Their travels included a visit to Moravia, where she met Jan&aacute;&#269;ek. Her advocacy of his music, then barely known in England, included a sympathetic review of <span class="italic">The Cunning Little Vixen</span> when she went to Prague in 1925 as correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and in the following year she was the prime mover in Jan&aacute;&#269;ek's visit to England. In gratitude, he dedicated his <span class="italic">Sinfonietta</span> to her.<br>
<br>Sir Henry Wood wrote that Mrs Newmarch's programme notes (which were republished in book form) were &#145;not merely a synopsis of the works she treats, but &hellip; beautiful specimens of English literature&#146;  (Wood, 232). As with much of her work, their somewhat subjective descriptive manner has dated, but they served to help appreciation of a great deal of the new music that Wood was introducing to Proms audiences, sometimes at her prompting. Similarly, her study of Tchaikovsky (1900), while interesting enough to have warranted a reissue in 1969, has long been superseded, though her translation of Modest Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">Life and Letters of P. I. Tchaikovsky</span> remains valuable. Her importance rests not on her scholarship, though she was thorough and meticulous (and contributed useful essays on Russian composers to the second, third, and fourth editions of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary</span>), but on her eloquent, and successful, appeal to English audiences on behalf of Russian and Czech music at a time when taste was still largely ruled by German symphonic music and Italian opera. She also introduced Sir Henry Wood to Sibelius's music, and wrote a monograph on it (1944). Other useful books included <span class="italic">The Russian Opera</span> (1914, reissued 1972) and <span class="italic">The Music of Czechoslovakia</span> (1942, reissued 1969). Her energy and enthusiasm of mind were retained into old age. She died at Percival's Hotel, Heene Terrace, Worthing, Sussex, on 9 April 1940.<br>
