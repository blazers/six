<span class="headword">Pugh,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic controversialist</span>, was born in Wales; Wood claimed that he had been born at Penrhyn in the parish of &#145;Eglos-Rosse&#146; (Llan-rhos) Caernarvonshire. In 1628 he entered the noviciate at the English College at Watten and by his ordination, on 20 March 1638, he was in Li&egrave;ge. In 1639 he returned to Watten and after two years at the English Jesuit college at St Omer in 1641&#150;2&#151;where he entered under the name of Robert Phillips&#151;he returned to England, where he is said to have served in Charles I's army taking the rank of captain. However, this led to his dismissal by the Jesuits on 8 May 1645 for, according to Wood, accompanying the royalist army &#145;without the consent of the superiors of his order&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.829). He bore the Jesuits no ill will following his dismissal and is said to have desired to be readmitted to the society when on his deathbed.<br>
<br>Following his dismissal from the society Pugh went on to study civil and canon law (probably at Paris) and became a doctor of both disciplines. He apparently acted as tutor to Henry, duke of Gloucester, the fourth son of Charles I. Pugh's reputation as a theologian grew rapidly, and in 1655 he was created <i>protonotarius publicus apostolicus</i> by Pope Alexander VII. He was known to Walter Montagu, the secret agent and friend of Henrietta Maria, who was later made abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Nanteuil by the queen-dowager of France. Pugh was a prominent opponent of Blackloism and with Montagu's aid he attacked the philosophical views of Thomas White (alias Blacklo) in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">De Anglicani cleri retinenda in apostolicam sedem observantia</span> (1659). In this he claimed, in opposition to White, that the regular clergy should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the Catholic chapter in England. White's views on purgatory, hell, and the infallibility of the pope were seen by many of the Catholic clergy as unsound and exception was also taken to his politico-religious views, especially his teaching in favour of passive obedience to any established government. Several of White's theses were censured by the inquisition in decrees of May 1655 and September 1657, and many of his friends and former students publicly rejected his principles. Eventually he withdrew those opinions which had been censured and submitted himself and his writings to the Holy See. White's reply to Pugh's repudiation, <span class="italic">Monumentum excantatus</span> (1660) was in turn answered by Pugh in <span class="italic">Excantationis amuletum</span> (1661). Using another alias, Petrus Hoburgus (an anagram of Robertus Pughus), which he had used in a letter to Cardinal Francesco Barberini in November 1661, Pugh published another attack on White in 1662 as <span class="italic">Animadversiones in Thomae Albii</span>. Pugh is also said to have written a life of White, which is not known to be extant.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration Pugh settled for part of the year in London and the rest in Redcastle, Wales, with the family of the marquess of Powis. In 1664 there appeared from the pen of &#145;a royal veteran&#146; <span class="italic">Elenchus elenchi, sive, Animadversiones</span>, a response to George Bates' <span class="italic">Elenchus motuum</span> (1650; <span class="italic">Elenchus elenchi</span>, title-page). It was initially credited to Pugh, but it has since been accepted that although it was not his work he probably had a hand in its production. With Roger Palmer, earl of Castlemaine, with whom he was closely connected, Pugh wrote <span class="italic">The Catholic Apologie</span> (1666). This text was answered by William Lloyd, later bishop of Lichfield, and was later defended in <span class="italic">A Reply to the Answer of the &#145;Catholic Apologie&#146;</span> (1668). Pugh's <span class="italic">Bathoniensium et aquisgranensium thermarum comparatio</span> (1676) was dedicated to his patron, Palmer. A series of manuscripts, reputedly by Pugh, entitled &#145;Unpublished works&#146;, from the Gillow Library, are to be found in the library of Downside Abbey. Pugh is also credited with the authorship of a Latin ode to the memory of Sidney Montagu, who died in the sea battle with the Dutch in June 1672, entitled <span class="italic">In nobilissimi juvenis Sidnaei Montacuti</span> (1672).<br>
<br>During the furore of the Popish Plot from 1678 onwards Pugh, &#145;having been betrayed by a wicked miscreant when paying a visit of charity to the Catholic gentry confined in a London prison&#146;  (Foley, ser. 7, 5.34), was himself committed to Newgate. Pugh died, while still incarcerated, on 22 January 1679. He was buried in Christ Church churchyard, Newgate, the next day. The following year the Jesuit John Warner published a cache of letters by White and several of White's associates (including Sir Kenelm Digby and Henry Holden) that Pugh had collected through the agency of Walter Montagu and had deposited at the English Jesuit college at Ghent; the work accused White of opposition to the regulars and to episcopal authority, and of disloyalty to the pope.<br>
<br>Wood, who appears to have known Pugh personally, described him as a &#145;person of a most comely port, well favour'd, and of excellent parts, and therefore he deserved a better end&#146;; however, Wood seems to confuse him with Robert Philips, the oratorian, who was confessor to Henrietta Maria  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.830).<br>
