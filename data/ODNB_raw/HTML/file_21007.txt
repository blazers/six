<span class="headword">Owen,  Hugh</span>  (1760&#150;1827), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, born in Shrewsbury and baptized on 14 June 1761, was the only son of Pryce Owen MD (<i>d</i>. 1786), a physician of Shrewsbury, and his wife, Bridget, only daughter of John Whitfield, also of Shrewsbury. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and in 1779 matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1783, and proceeded MA in 1807. He was ordained deacon in 1784 and priest in 1785. He was perpetual curate at Berwick, Shropshire (1791&#150;1800), and in 1791 was presented by the earl of Tankerville to the vicarage of St Julian, Shrewsbury; in 1803 he was collated by Bishop Douglas to the prebend of Gillingham Minor in the cathedral of Salisbury; and in 1819 he was presented by the dean and chapter of Exeter to part of the vicarage of Bampton, Oxfordshire. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and mayor of Shrewsbury in 1819.<br>
<br>Owen was collated by Bishop Cornwallis on 27 December 1821 to the archdeaconry of Shropshire, and on 30 March 1822 to the prebend of Bishopshill in the church of Lichfield. In 1826 he became minister of the royal peculiar of St Mary's, Shrewsbury, and he then resigned the church of St Julian, though he continued to be portionist of the vicarage of Bampton. He lived latterly at Betws Hall, Montgomeryshire, having in or before 1788 married Harriet, daughter of Edward Jeffries of Shrewsbury. Their only son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20995/', "Edward Pryce Owen (1788&#150;1863)")</script>. They also had a daughter.<br>
<br>Owen is chiefly remembered as an antiquary, though he was never so well known as his collaborator, John Brickdale Blakeway (1765&#150;1826). His principal work, published with Blakeway, was <span class="italic">A History of Shrewsbury</span> (2 vols., 1825). Owen had already published, anonymously, <span class="italic">Some Account of the Ancient and Present State of Shrewsbury</span> (2 vols., 1808&#150;10), which contained abundant ecclesiastical information. A second edition, much altered, was prepared by Owen but never published. To Britton's <span class="italic">Architectural Antiquities</span> (vol. 4) he contributed, with Blakeway, descriptions of Wenlock Abbey, and of Ludlow and Stokesay castles. Owen died at Shrewsbury on 23 December 1827.<br>
