<span class="headword">Wallis,  Robert William</span>  (1794&#150;1878), <span class="occ">line engraver</span>, was born in London on 7 November 1794, the eldest son of Thomas Wallis (<i>d</i>. 1839), assistant to the topographical engraver Charles Theodosius Heath (1785&#150;1848), and his wife, Ann Davies. He was taught engraving by his father, who moved the family first to Bungay in Suffolk, from 1803 to 1812, and then to Bethnal Green and Liverpool. He returned in 1818 to London, where he was rejoined by his father in 1821. He married, at Shoreditch on 25 March 1819, Janet Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Munro (<i>d</i>. 1857), with whom he had nine children. On his return to London he immediately found employment as a landscape engraver on steel, providing illustrations for the numerous travel books then reaching the market. James Baylis Allen (1803&#150;1876) worked as his assistant. By the mid-century Wallis was judged one of the ablest landscape engravers, excelling in the interpretation of the work of Joseph Mallord William Turner. He was employed on Turner's illustrations to Cooke's <span class="italic">Southern Coast of England</span>; Turner's <span class="italic">England and Wales</span> and his <span class="italic">Rivers of France</span>; <span class="italic">Heath's Picturesque Annual</span>; <span class="italic">Jennings Landscape Annual</span>; and the illustrations to many fine editions of popular works. Fourteen of his engravings were published in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> between 1849 and 1880. His finest productions were the large plates after Turner's <span class="italic">Lake of Nemi</span> and <span class="italic">The Approach to Venice</span>, a proof of which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1859. Wallis then retired, and passed the remainder of his life in the Brighton area; he died at his home, 30 York Road, Hove, Sussex, on 23 November 1878.<br>
<br>Robert's brother <a name="cosubject_28571"></a><span class="headword">(William) Henry Wallis</span>  (1805&#150;1890)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Bungay, Suffolk, on 5 February 1805, practised for some years as an engraver of small topographical illustrations for books. Both Henry and Robert often signed their work simply &#145;Wallis&#146;, leading on occasion to problems of identification. In the 1840s Henry suffered two attacks of paralysis, which obliged him to find another occupation. He then turned to picture dealing, and in 1861 was offered the post of manager at the French Gallery at 120 Pall Mall. He bought out the owner, Ernest Gambart, in 1867 for &pound;1000. In 1871 he retired in favour of his son Thomas. He died at home at 55 Effra Road, Brixton, on 15 October 1890.<br>
