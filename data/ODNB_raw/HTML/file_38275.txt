<span class="headword">Eliot <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Haigh-Wood]</span>,  Vivienne Haigh <span class="st"> [Vivien]</span></span>  (1888&#150;1947), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 28 May 1888 at Knowsley Street, Bury, Lancashire, the daughter of Charles Haigh-Wood (1854&#150;1927), a successful artist from a carving and gilding background, and his wife, Rose Esther Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1941). Vivienne's brother Maurice was born in 1896. He was to fight throughout the First World War&#151;a dark, strapping, well-conducted man who was fond of his frail, intense sister.<br>
<br>In childhood Vivienne, known often as Vivien, suffered poor health including tuberculosis of the bone in her left arm, and some form of nervous illness alleviated by opiates. As a young woman she painted and took up ballet, and was a governess with a family in Cambridge for a short period. In 1914 she had a stormy attachment to a schoolmaster, Charles Buckle.<br>
<br>In spring 1915, when Vivienne was turning twenty-seven, she met the 26-year-old poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32993/', "T. S. Eliot (1888&#150;1965)")</script>, then a visiting student from America having a deadly time in an Oxford emptied by war. Repressed and shy, with a family history of puritan divines and memories of unfulfilled love for a proper Bostonian called Emily Hale, Eliot was jolted to life by the flamboyant Vivienne, her &#145;amusing&#146; name  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 97), and her daring to smoke in public. She proved a pliant dancer, keen to follow when Eliot began to &#145;dip&#146; in his one-step in a style unknown in England. It appealed to him that Vivienne would never say she liked Bach or C&eacute;zanne if she didn't. She looked like an actress in her bold colours: she owned a scarf-dress in the post-war years and, in the thirties, got herself up in a cape and waistcoat, and flourished a cigarette-holder. This was not the kind of woman a gentleman could introduce to his mother. Though her parents lived comfortably in Hampstead, London, Eliot's old New England background was very much grander.<br>
<br>They married impulsively without waiting to tell their parents. The ceremony took place on 26 June 1915 in the presence of Vivienne's friend Lucy Ely Thayer and aunt Lillia C. Symes at the Hampstead register office near Vivienne's home at 3 Compayne Gardens. Vivienne was going to save Eliot for poetry, which meant keeping him from academe. He had been due to return to America, but rebelled against a future as a Harvard philosopher. An English marriage made it possible for him to deal that prospect an all-out blow, and Vivienne stood up for him against the disapproval of the Eliot family. &#145;Tom knows perfectly well that I share his feeling over the poetry. &hellip; I look upon Tom's poetry as real genius&#146;, she told his brother. &#145;I provide the motive power&#146;, she added, &#145;I <i>do</i> shove&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 157). Later she was incredulous that her creative (as opposed to destructive) bond with Eliot should have been obliterated during his lifetime. During their early years together her hatred of the &#145;fug and slop&#146; of sentiment  (Gordon, <span class="italic">Eliot</span>, 129), her alienation from most people, and her susceptibility to horror matched and promoted the state of mind which, in Eliot's own words, &#145;led to <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, introduction). Vivienne, advising on a draft of the poem, wrote &#145;<span class="smallcap">WONDERFUL</span>&#146; next to the voice of the distraught wife in the second part. Later, in her copy of his <span class="italic">Poems, 1909&#150;1925</span>, Eliot noted that only she would understand them.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1915, two weeks after the marriage, Vivienne told Eliot's former teacher Bertrand Russell that she had married her husband to stimulate him, but found she could not do it. She fell into a pattern of illness, convalescence, and relapse: migraines, fainting, stomach upsets, and disordered hormones which led to heavy, unpredictable menstruation. Eliot sought help from Russell, who obliged by making up to Vivienne over a long period, which culminated in a night they spent together in October 1917.<br>
<br>Vivienne did not care for literary society, especially the Bloomsbury group, but she befriended two of its adherents: the well-read, sophisticated Mary Hutchinson and Lady Ottoline Morrell. Vivienne also shone as an actress in private theatricals which the Eliots enjoyed with Violet and Sydney Schiff (the author Stephen Hudson) in 1919&#150;20. Whenever she demonstrated flair as actress, dancer, or writer, Eliot liked to show her off. Katherine Mansfield observed the way he kept a wing over Vivienne when they came to dinner in summer 1920, &#145;admiring, listening, making the most of her&#146;  (letter to Violet Schiff, 1 May 1920, BL, quoted in C. Tomalin, <span class="italic">Katherine Mansfield: a Secret Life</span>, 197). This contrasts with the other Vivienne who could not gain her husband's love (in his poetic phantasmagoria he remained in love with an idealized memory of Emily Hale), and who increasingly took the part of an invalid. This came to a head in 1923 when Eliot wished to leave his post at Lloyds Bank in order to devote more time to writing. His wife developed colitis, and nearly died.<br>
<br>Vivienne did, however, show an unexpected capacity to rally. From February 1924 to July 1925 she often contributed to her husband's international journal <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, whose name had been her choice (after a hotel where she and Buckle used to dine). Eliot thought her original, and did not hesitate to publish her stories and reviews, completing some if she were too ill to do so, or touching them up. She took on an array of pseudonyms: Fanny Marlow, Feiron Morris, Felise Morrison, FM, and Irene Fassett. Vivienne saw Fanny Marlow as the money-maker, spinning on forever like a spider. &#145;There is no <i>end</i> to Fanny! But Feiron will never make money. And he does not spin. He is a nasty fellow&#146;  (letter to S. Schiff [n. d.], BL, quoted in Gordon, <span class="italic">Eliot</span>, 193).<br>
<br>Feiron is the author of Vivienne's most ambitious story, &#145;The Paralysed Woman&#146;, in which the external paralysis of an immaculate wife in a perfect home holds up a mirror to the internal paralysis of a writer, Sybilla, who lives with a hypochondriacal husband in a ramshackle, carping milieu. Other sketches, of a dingy Parisian hotel and its inhabitants, a <i>th&eacute; dansant</i> in London, or a boring bohemian party where ballet dancers are shepherded by a &#145;macaw&#146;, are all emotionally alive and observant, with plangent minutiae, reminiscent of Katherine Mansfield. Vivienne planned an interlinked series which could appear separately but could make up a book.<br>
<br>Vivienne enjoyed her success, but confided to Schiff in 1924 her fear that it &#145;is a sort of flash in the pan&#151;that won't <i>go on</i>&#146;. She spoke of writing as &#145;this temporary aberration of mine&#146;  (letter, 2 April 1924, BL). Her diaries protest against Eliot's attempt to regulate her writing habits, which he believed might exacerbate her illness. She argued that her material came irregularly from some &#145;very overgrown and hidden inner spirit&#146;, which would suddenly begin to spurt:<blockquote>I think at first, until one has got the spout of this long disused fountain clear, it is better to let the water burst out when it will &amp; so <i>force</i> away the accumulation of decayed vegetation, moss, slime &amp; dead fish which are thick upon &amp; around it. (Vivienne Eliot's papers, Bodl. Oxf.)</blockquote>This effort collapsed when Eliot's associates at the New York <span class="italic">Dial</span> rejected &#145;The Paralysed Woman&#146;&#151;it remained unpublished.<br>
<br>In a poem &#145;Necesse est perstare?&#146; Vivienne (as FM) recounts a moment after a literary lunch. The wife is thankful for an end to gossip about Clive Bell, Elizabeth Bibesco, and Aldous Huxley. She longs to win her husband from his resolve to master the literary scene. But he stretches his arms above his head with the weary air of a very old monkey, impervious to her silent plea. Vivienne channelled her frustration into a diatribe against America in her &#145;Diary of the Rive Gauche&#146; (under the name Fanny Marlow). The narrator repeats (mimicking the repetitive manner of Vivienne's own talk):<blockquote>that I never did understand Americans &hellip; When I see an American coming I ought to say immediately, &#145;Please do not speak to me, because if you do I shall not understand you. I shall never understand you.&#146; &hellip; They cannot cope with European women. Ha! They can't cope with us! (<span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, 3, Jan 1925, 292)</blockquote>Vivienne was insensitive to Eliot's need for time and privacy. Eloquent, febrile, now and then on the verge of collapse, she had needs of her own, and these Eliot met with conscientious patience for seventeen years. Though Vivienne shared the snobbery, antisemitism, and virulence her husband called &#145;hatred of life&#146;, she did not share his moral struggle for transformation. Few could bear Vivienne for long: she was quick to fault others, and later joined Sir Oswald Mosley's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96364', "British Union of Fascists")</script>. She was the sort of fascist who enjoyed wearing uniform and the excitement of a rally where public denunciations provided an outlet for fury. After Eliot left her in 1932&#150;3 she made many attempts to intercept him. These were invariably foiled, for, aided by friends and protectors, he had put himself beyond her reach. Increasingly desperate, Vivienne had attacks of panic&#151;as though she saw &#145;a goblin ghost&#146;  (Mirrlees, 50).<br>
<br>Vivienne rallied yet again to begin a new career in 1935&#150;6 at the Royal College of Music, first as a pianist, then elated to discover a <i>huge</i> voice in singing lessons. Her manner, though, grew wilder as she began to fear she was the victim of some plot. As it happens, the plots of two of Eliot's plays suggest a continued, almost eerie affinity in their turn for horror: &#145;I knew a man once did a girl in&#146;, reports Sweeney in Eliot's first verse play, <span class="italic">Sweeney Agonistes</span> (1926); and again, in <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span> (1939), a hero is shaken by temptation to murder. His dream-victim is his wife, a shivering painted shadow&#151;exactly as Vivienne appeared in the thirties.<br>
<br>In July 1938, at the time Eliot was completing this play, Vivienne was certified insane, and was committed to a private London asylum, Northumberland House. Once, she tried to escape, but was apprehended. After some years abroad, when Maurice Haigh-Wood saw his sister in 1946 he acknowledged that she was sane. Vivienne Eliot remained in Northumberland House until she died of a heart attack on 22 January 1947.<br>
<br>A few years later Bertrand Russell wrote &#145;Mrs Ellerker&#146;, a story based on Mrs Eliot, about a woman who is too sane to lend herself to the artifice of repression. It was not, though, until the mid-seventies that Vivienne was brought out of the shadow and her talents recognized, reinforced by Valerie Eliot's inclusion of Vivienne's correspondence in her volume of Eliot's early letters (1988). The combined letters confirmed the need for a delicate biographic balance, but this was skewed by a simplistic &#145;biopic&#146;, <span class="italic">Tom and Viv</span> (1994), trailed by a partisan biography (2001) which sought to vindicate Vivienne by nailing Eliot. The truth is more ambiguous, and it is unlikely that the whole truth can ever be known.<br>
