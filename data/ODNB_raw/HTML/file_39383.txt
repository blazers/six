<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boulton,  (Thomas) Ernest</span>  (1847&#150;1904), <span class="occ">transvestite</span>, was born at Kings Road, Tottenham, London, on 18 December 1847, the elder of two sons of Thomas Alfred Boulton (1816/17&#150;1887), wine merchant, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levick (<i>b</i>. 1822/3). From his sixth year he showed an aptitude for playing female characters. He would dress as a parlourmaid, and once waited at table upon his grandmother, who said when he left the room, &#145;I wonder, having sons, that you have so flippant a girl about you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 223). His parents, who lived at Greenwich, accepted his public cross-dressing. He worked for his uncle, who was a City stockbroker, and as a clerk in the London and County Bank (1866&#150;7). He was thought to be consumptive, suffered from a fistula, and underwent several operations.<br>
<br>Boulton became the inseparable friend of Frederick William Park (whose father was master in the court of common pleas) and the lover of the duke of Newcastle's son, Lord Arthur Pelham Clinton, MP for Newark. From 1867 Boulton and Park, who were known in their set as Stella and Fanny, travelled in the English provinces impersonating female characters at private theatricals. Boulton, who possessed a fine soprano voice, received as many as fourteen bouquets at each performance. Boulton and Park rented a bedroom with sitting room at 13 Wakefield Street, off Regent Square, where they kept an extensive wardrobe of women's clothes and ornaments. They began appearing, dressed as women, at music-halls, theatres, restaurants, shopping arcades, and other resorts near Mayfair. Their conversation, which centred on theatricals, was frivolous and lively. When dressed as women, they painted their faces, chirruped with their lips, and coquetted. Courageous and generous, they were not prostitutes but sometimes asked their admirers for money.<br>
<br>In April 1870 Boulton and Park were arrested in company with a man who believed they were women, although they had repeatedly told him they were men. At his first appearance in the dock Boulton wore a cherry-coloured silk evening dress trimmed with white lace, bracelets on bare arms, a wig, and plaited chignon. They were originally charged with intent to commit a felony, but eight physicians who illegally subjected them to anal examination in Newgate found little evidence of sodomy; instead they were committed for trial in May on milder charges of conspiring to commit felonious crimes and of outraging decency by going about dressed as women. Though their supposed soliciting of men while cross-dressing was central to the prosecution, they prinked themselves to ape the antics of women rather than to seduce men: their intentions seem less sexual than exhibitionistic or even burlesque. The easy-going levity of the throng at their committal proceedings excited the indignation of public moralists. After the Society for the Suppression of Vice requested all evidence to be taken in secrecy, the public were excluded from some police-court hearings. Nevertheless, leaving in a police van, Boulton and Park were saluted in the streets by crowds waving their hats. The police seized a huge mass of correspondence which, though camp, contained not one word of indecency. They failed to cajole the parties to denounce each other or to muster convincing witnesses. Lord Arthur died in June aged twenty-nine (officially of scarlet fever aggravated by anxiety, but perhaps by suicide), yet was vindictively kept on the charge sheet, together with two other young men, Louis Hurt, a clerk in the Post Office, and John Fiske, American consul at Leith.<br>
<br>The trial opened before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn on 9 May 1871, when Boulton was twenty-two, and lasted six days. Prosecuting counsel included Sir Robert Collier (later Lord Monkswell), Sir John Coleridge, Hardinge Giffard (later earl of Halsbury), and Henry James. The case is important for showing that police, physicians, and lawyers were inexperienced in preparing such prosecutions, and that pathological models of homosexuality were not yet established in Britain. Boulton and Park employed as their solicitor George Lewis, who devised an effective defence that the youths were silly but not criminal. It was doubtless at his insistence that Boulton grew a moustache and Park whiskers. When the defendants were acquitted, Boulton fainted.<br>
<br>After the trial Boulton performed as a female impersonator in variety theatres around the county, before going to the USA. His occupation was recorded as actor when he died, on 30 September 1904, of a brain tumour, at the National Hospital, Queen Square, London.<br>
<br>By Henry Matthews (later Viscount Llandaff) Boulton was described as &#145;a dainty and pleasing boy who was generally treated as a young girl&#146;  (Roughead, 178) and by Simeon Solomon as &#145;not quite beautiful but supremely pretty, a perfect figure, manner and voice&#146;  (Croft-Cooke, 47). Boulton and Park feature in Jack Saul's pornographic <span class="italic">The Sins of the Cities of the Plain</span> (1881) and are the subject of a Victorian limerick:<blockquote>
<div>There was an old person of Sark<br>
</div>
<div>Who buggered a pig in the dark;<br>
</div>
<div>The swine in surprise<br>
</div>
<div>Murmured: &#145;God blast your eyes<br>
</div>
<div>Do you take me for Boulton or Park?&#146;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
