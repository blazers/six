<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  James</span>  (1863&#150;1935), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 6 April 1863 at Dundee, the only son of James Walker, a flax merchant in the town, and his wife, Susan Hutchison, daughter of Arthur Cairns, also of Dundee. Walker showed an interest in science at Dundee high school, but although he passed the entrance examination for St Andrews University at the age of sixteen, he became an apprentice to a flax and jute spinner for three years. He finally entered Edinburgh University in 1882, where his teachers included Alexander Crum Brown (1838&#150;1922), who diverted Walker's interests towards chemistry. Graduating BSc in 1885, he carried out experimental work with Thomas Carnelley in University College, Dundee, during his vacations and graduated DSc (Edinburgh) in 1886. He then spent three years in Germany studying with Ludwig Claisen and Adolf Baeyer in Munich and with the influential Wilhelm Ostwald (1853&#150;1932) at Leipzig. Having obtained his PhD at Leipzig in 1889 he carried his new-found enthusiasm for physical chemistry back to Edinburgh where he had been appointed research assistant to Crum Brown. He held this post for three years, his chief work being on electrolytic synthesis. In 1892 he joined the laboratory of William Ramsay in University College, London, at that time the leading centre for physical chemistry in the United Kingdom. In 1893 he became Ramsay's second assistant.<br>
<br>In 1894 Walker was elected professor of chemistry at University College, Dundee. He succeeded Crum Brown as professor of chemistry in Edinburgh in 1908. The First World War interfered with academic work, and Walker devoted himself instead to the manufacture of trinitrotoluene (TNT), then in great demand as a high explosive. In 1918 he returned to the manifold problems of the post-war period. He planned and saw built at Edinburgh one of the finest university chemical laboratories in the country, and established a research school there in order to provide the higher training for chemistry being demanded by the greatly expanded British chemical industry. He retired in 1928.<br>
<br>As Ostwald's first British pupil and disciple, Walker had the unenviable responsibility of being the chief English-speaking protagonist of the new physical chemistry of Ostwald, J. H. van't Hoff, and S. A. Arrhenius, which was largely based on the last's controversial ionic theory. He proved an able propagandist, chiefly through his translation in 1890 of Ostwald's textbook, <span class="italic">Grundriss der allgemeinen Chemie</span> (<span class="italic">Outlines of General Chemistry</span>), and most notably through his own readable textbook, <span class="italic">Introduction to Physical Chemistry</span> (1899), which went through ten editions and was a set book in many British university chemistry courses. His most important work in this field was the elaboration of methods of electrolysis in the synthesis of dicarboxylic acids, and in finding support for the ionic theory. He published researches on hydrolysis, the affinity constants of weak acids and bases, investigated amphoteric electrolytes and reaction velocities, and determined molecular weights by freezing-point depressions.<br>
<br>Although Walker made no important discoveries, his experimental work and his influence as a teacher did much to win support for physical chemistry in Great Britain. His advice was widely sought on a great variety of matters and given with equal readiness. He was a fine musician and possessed a flair for languages; Ramsay once mistook him for a German, while as a young man he was in great demand as a Russian translator. He was a founder member of the Alembic Club of Edinburgh which became well known for sponsoring reprints of historical chemical papers. He received many honours, both for his academic and industrial activities, including a knighthood in 1921 for his war work. The honorary degree of LLD was conferred upon him by the universities of St Andrews (1909) and Edinburgh (1929). In 1900 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, by which he was awarded the Davy medal in 1926.<br>
<br>On 1 September 1897 Walker married Annie Purcell Sedgwick [<a name="cosubject_56154"></a><span class="headword">Annie Purcell Walker</span>, Lady Walker  (1871&#150;1950)], <span class="occ">chemist</span>, elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel William Sedgwick of Godalming. She was born in Cork on 4 December 1871 and educated at Girton College, Cambridge, where she gained second-class honours in the science tripos in 1893. She then joined Norman Collie as a research student at University College, London, where she met her husband. She published three papers on organic chemistry, but abandoned research after 1905. There was one son, Frederick, who became a geologist. Walker died at 5 Wester Coates Road, Edinburgh, on 6 May 1935; his wife died in the same city on 7 September 1950.<br>
