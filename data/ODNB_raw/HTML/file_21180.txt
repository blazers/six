<span class="headword">Palmer,  Edward Henry</span>  (1840&#150;1882), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born on 7 August 1840 in Green Street, Cambridge, the only son of William Henry and Mary Palmer. His father kept a private school in Cambridge. Left an orphan in infancy, Palmer was brought up by an aunt at Cambridge, where he attended the Perse School. As a boy he spent much time with Gypsies, and acquired a fluency in Romani and a knowledge of Gypsy life and ways. On leaving school, at the age of sixteen, he became a junior clerk to Hill and Underwood, wine merchants, of Eastcheap, London. He learned to speak French and several Italian dialects fluently by mixing with native speakers living in London and his success made him a firm upholder of this informal, conversational method of learning languages. His evenings were often spent at the theatre, where he formed a lifelong friendship with Henry Irving; or else in mesmeric experiments, in which he exhibited extraordinary powers.<br>
<br>In 1859 Palmer developed grave symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis and returned to Cambridge prepared to die, but suddenly recovered. While convalescing he published poetry and wrote a farce which was performed at the Cambridge Theatre in 1860. Towards the end of 1860 he met Saiyid Abdullah, teacher of Hindustani at Cambridge. The two became friends and Palmer began to study oriental languages. His progress in Persian, Arabic, and Hindustani was phenomenally rapid.<br>
<br>Some fellows of St John's College discovered Palmer's gift for languages and by their influence he was admitted as a sizar there in October 1863. He matriculated in November 1864 and in 1865 was awarded a foundation scholarship. He graduated BA in 1867, with only a third class in the classical tripos, and proceeded MA in 1870; but his main energies as an undergraduate were given to oriental studies. During this period he catalogued the Persian, Arabic, and Turkish manuscripts of King's College and Trinity College (1870), and also of the university library. His catalogues were considered by Arberry (<span class="italic">Oriental Essays</span>, 1960) still to be useful to scholars, although their method was antiquated. Palmer also wrote in Persian and Urdu for the <span class="italic">Oudh Akhb&acirc;r</span> and other Indian newspapers, also becoming a recognized expert in Hindustani. He published <span class="italic">Oriental Mysticism: a Treatise on the Sufiistic and Unitarian Theosophy of the Persians</span> (1867), founded on the &#145;Maksad-i Aks&acirc;&#146; of &#145;Aziz ibn Mohammad Nafasi, preserved in manuscript at Trinity College; and translated (1865) Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">Paradise and the Peri</span> into Persian verse. He was a member of the French Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Asiatique and of the Royal Asiatic Society.<br>
<br>Palmer was elected to a fellowship at St John's College on 5 November 1867. The fellowship gave him time to pursue his studies and visit the East. He had in 1867 unsuccessfully sought the post of oriental secretary to the British legation in Persia and in 1869 he was chosen to join the survey of Sinai, for the Palestine Exploration Fund. His principal duty was to collect from the Bedouin the correct names of places on the Sinai peninsula. He thus came for the first time into contact with Arabs, learned to speak their dialects, and obtained an insight into their modes of thought and life. In the summer of 1869 he returned to England, but left again on 16 December for another expedition. This time he and Charles Frederick Tyrwhitt-Drake walked alone the 600 miles from Sinai to Jerusalem, identifying sites and searching vainly for inscriptions. They explored for the first time the Desert of the Wanderings (Tih), and many unknown parts of Edom and Moab, and accomplished much useful geographical work. <i>En route</i> Palmer made many friends among the Arab sheikhs, among whom he went by the name of &#145;Abdallah Efendi. The travellers went on to Lebanon and to Damascus, where they met Captain Richard Burton, who was then consul there, and with whom Palmer struck up a friendship. They returned home in the autumn of 1870 by way of Constantinople and Vienna.<br>
<br>A popular account of these two expeditions was written by Palmer in <span class="italic">The Desert of the Exodus: Journeys on Foot in the Wilderness of the Forty Years' Wanderings</span> (2 vols., 1871, illustrated with maps and engravings; reprinted, 1977); he also published an article in the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span> (1873) on the secret sects of Syria, while the scientific results of the second expedition were detailed in the Palestine Exploration Fund's <span class="italic">Journal</span> of 1871, and included in <span class="italic">Special Papers Relating to the Survey of Western Palestine</span> (1881). Although he took no further part in the expeditions of the Palestine Fund, he devoted much time and interest to the work of the society. In 1881 he transliterated and edited the <span class="italic">Arabic and English Name-Lists of the Survey of Western Palestine</span>&#151;some 10,000 place names&#151;and assisted in editing the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of the survey (1881&#150;3). He also wrote, with Walter Besant, a close friend and later his biographer, a short history of Jerusalem, <span class="italic">Jerusalem, the City of Herod and of Saladin</span> (1871; new edn, 1888), a book which Arberry considered still of value.<br>
<br>Palmer returned to Cambridge, where he studied, wrote, and lectured for the next ten years. In 1871 he failed in his bid for the Adams professorship of Arabic, but was appointed the lord almoner's professor of Arabic. The post was worth only &pound;40 10<i>s</i>. a year, but it enabled him to retain his fellowship though married, and on the day after his appointment, 11 November 1871, he married Laura Hanbury Davis (<i>d</i>. 1878), to whom he had been engaged for several years, daughter of Thomas H. Davis of Grantchester. They had two daughters, and a son who died in infancy. In 1873, in consequence of the creation of the triposes of oriental languages, Palmer's salary and his workload increased considerably. In addition he was one of the interpreters to the shah of Persia during his visit to London in 1873, and wrote an account of it in Urdu for a Lucknow paper. He published a <span class="italic">Concise Dictionary of the Persian Language</span> (1876; 2nd edn, 1884), of which the English&#150;Persian counterpart was edited from his notes after his death by Guy Le Strange (1883). It was a useful work for beginners although by 1960 largely superseded.<br>
<br>Palmer's verse translation of <span class="italic">Poetical Works of Beh&aacute;-ed-din Zoheir of Egypt</span> appeared in two volumes (1876&#150;7) but the third volume, of notes, was never published. The work was admired by contemporaries, not least as it was the first translation of the entire works of any Arabic poet. It was Palmer's most serious work but he laid himself open to charges of unscholarliness, as he chose to make free with the verse in an attempt to catch its spirit. His <span class="roman">Koran</span> (1880) was the best-known of his works, being reprinted numerous times throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is immature and hastily written, and has the opposite fault from that of his other, too free, translations in its literal, often word-for-word rendering although it, too, had its admirers. His <span class="italic">Arabic Grammar</span> (1874), like everything he did, broke new ground in Europe, by explaining and illustrating Arabic inflexion, syntax, and prosody in a method used by the Arabs themselves. Among his other writings were a <span class="italic">Simplified Grammar of Hindustani, Persian, and Arabic</span> (1882; 2nd edn, 1885) and two little books on Jewish history and geography, written for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (1874).<br>
<br>Besides these, Palmer revised a Persian <span class="roman">New Testament</span> for the Bible Society; examined, in 1881&#150;2, in Hindustani for the civil service commission; assisted Eirikr Magn&uacute;sson in translating Johan Ludvig Runeberg's <span class="italic">Lyrical Songs</span> from the Finnish (1878); edited Pierce Butler's translation of A. G. Oehlenschl&auml;ger's <span class="italic">Axel og Valborg</span> from the Danish (1874); joined Charles Godfrey Leland and Janet Tuckey in producing <span class="italic">English Gipsy Songs in Romany, with Metrical English Translations</span> (1875); edited the first six volumes of Tr&uuml;bner's <span class="italic">Simplified Grammars</span>; wrote the articles &#145;Hafiz&#146; and &#145;Legerdemain&#146; for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>; and developed a marvellous talent in conjuring. Originally with a view (soon abandoned) to Indian practice, he was called to the bar in 1874 at the Middle Temple, and even went on the eastern circuit for two or three years, taking briefs occasionally.<br>
<br>With his eclectic talents and interests Palmer found himself out of sympathy with university life. The death of his wife, after a long illness, in 1878, unsettled him although he married again on 26 June 1879. His second wife was Augusta Marghereta Elisabeth, daughter of Count von Langa of Poland. Palmer grew tired of college life and lectures and in 1881 abandoned his lectures; retaining only the professorship, with its nominal salary, he began life as a journalist on the staff of <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, where he acted as leader writer on social and general topics, until his departure for Egypt on a secret service mission on 30 June 1882.<br>
<br>Palmer was sent by Gladstone's government to attempt to detach the Arab tribes from the side of Arabi Pasha, the nationalist leader, and to use his influence, backed by English gold, with the sheikhs of the Bedouin, to secure the immunity of the Suez Canal from Arab attack, and provide for its repair after possible damage by Arabi's men. On his arrival at Alexandria, on 5 July 1882, he received instructions to proceed to Jaffa, thence to enter the desert and make his way to Suez, talking to the principal sheikhs <i>en route</i>. As &#145;Abdallah Efendi, Palmer rode his camel through the desert, armed and dressed in the richest Syrian style, giving handsome presents to his old acquaintances among the Tiy&acirc;ha, and securing their loyalty to the khedive rather than to Arabi. Palmer reported that he had:<blockquote>got hold of some of the very men whom Ar&acirc;bi Pasha has been trying to get over to his side; and when they are wanted I can have every Bedawi at my call, from Suez to Gaza &hellip; I am certain of success. (journal to his wife, in Besant, 270ff.)</blockquote>After three weeks' disappearance in the desert Palmer joined the British fleet at Suez on 1 August. The next day he was in the first boat that landed for the occupation of Suez, and was engaged in reassuring the non-combatant inhabitants. He was appointed interpreter-in-chief to her majesty's forces in Egypt. His work among the Bedouin was approved by Admiral W. Hewett in Egypt and by the first lord of the Admiralty (Lord Northbrook), and Palmer himself was convinced that, with &pound;20,000 or &pound;30,000 to buy their allegiance, he could raise a force of 50,000 Bedouin to guard or unblock the Suez Canal. On 6 August &pound;20,000 was placed at his disposal by the admiral; but Lord Northbrook instructed that Palmer was initially to spend only &#145;a reasonable amount&#146;. In fact on the night of 19&#150;20 August the British troops occupied the canal zone, which had always been their primary objective, so promptly and effectively, that the Bedouin were largely irrelevant: but they gave the invaders no trouble, and this may have been due to Palmer's presents and influence. The bulk of the money which was to have secured their more active support never reached them, owing to the tragic fate which overtook Palmer. On 8 August he set out to meet the leading sheikhs to arrange the final terms of their allegiance. In accordance with Lord Northbrook's instructions, he took with him only &pound;3000 in English gold for this purpose, to begin with. He took a naval officer, Flag-Lieutenant Harold Charrington, as a guarantee of his official status. Captain William John Gill RE, the traveller, also accompanied him, with the intention of turning aside and cutting the telegraph wire which crossed the desert and connected Cairo with Constantinople. Two servants attended them, besides camel-drivers; and &#145;Meter Abu Sofieh&#146;, who claimed to be a prominent sheikh, joined the party, as a guide and protector. Heading for Nakhl, Abu Sofieh led them into an ambush on the night of 10&#150;11 August. They were made prisoners and their baggage was plundered. There was at the time an order out from Cairo for Palmer's arrest, dead or alive; but it is probable that the original motive of the attack was robbery. On the following morning, 11 August, the prisoners were driven about a mile to the Wadi Sudr, between al-&#145;Arish and Nakhl, and shot, Palmer being the first to die. The facts were ascertained only after an inquiry by Colonel Charles Warren RE, who was sent out by the government on a mission, which ended in the conviction of the murderers. The fragmentary remains of Palmer, Gill, and Charrington, identifiable only by their clothes, were brought home and buried in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral on 6 April 1883. Richard Burton wrote a long account of his journey to investigate Palmer's murder, but it was never published.<br>
<br>Palmer was by all accounts light-hearted and good company, a fine linguist but ill-suited to the academic life or careful sustained scholarship. His journals to his wife suggest that he was thoroughly enjoying his new role as a secret agent and he appears to have revealed the details of his mission to his friend and biographer Besant before setting out: the seriousness of the task in which he had become embroiled is shown not by his excited accounts of his exploits but by the sordid brutality of his death. His end attracted both widespread sympathy but also controversy in Britain and Egypt.<br>
