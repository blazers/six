<span class="headword">Marsh,  Irene Mabel</span>  (1875&#150;1938), <span class="occ">promoter of women's physical education</span>, was born at 13 Grey Road, Walton, Lancashire, on 3 December 1875, the second daughter and the third in the family of ten children of Peter Walter Marsh, and his wife, Anne Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fowler. Her father, a well-established sack merchant in Liverpool, was a staunch churchman, town councillor, member of the Band of Hope, and cricketer. Her mother was extravagant and good natured. The garden of the family home, Courtenay House, Waterloo, Liverpool, backed onto the sea and contained a trapeze and parallel bars. She was educated privately by a governess until she was sixteen years old and attended the gymnasium in Clive Road directed by Miss Davies. She was an outstanding athlete, tennis player, and fencer and a very strong swimmer. Much of her swimming was learnt in Bootle Baths, where she showed a flair for organizing and teaching children to swim.<br>
<br>In 1893 Marsh entered Southport Physical Training College and Gymnasium to train for two years under Alexander and Emily Alexander. Her first teaching post, at Freshfield School, was part-time. Simultaneously she ran classes near her home and became director of Bootle Gymnasium, after which she was appointed director of the YMCA gymnasium in Myrtle Street, Liverpool, a post she retained until her death. By living at home and walking to work instead of travelling by tram she saved &pound;100, which enabled her to rent 110 Bedford Street, Liverpool, as premises for her own institution.<br>
<br>Marsh was the founder and first principal of Liverpool Physical Training College, whose establishment in 1900 arose from Marsh's belief in the need to offer opportunities in the north of England for girls to train as teachers of physical education, a relatively new profession for women. Her first pupil was her sister, Salome, followed by a cousin, Muriel Pert, and Pearl Taverner, who all qualified in 1902. In 1901 she recruited Carrie Walford and E. D. Browne, and in 1902 Bertha Knowles, Nancy Black, and Amy Carpenter; the two groups qualified in 1903 and 1904 respectively. By 1919 there were 120 students in training. Gradually resident and visiting staff were appointed and by 1908 there were seven full-time staff in addition to Marsh herself. She was encouraged in her enterprise by the bishop and archdeacon of Liverpool (F. J. Chavasse and T. J. Madden) and the eminent Liverpool orthopaedic surgeon Robert Jones.<br>
<br>By 1920 Marsh had moved the junior part of her college to Barkhill House, 4 miles south-east of the city centre, which she had purchased in 1919. The senior college remained in the centre of Liverpool until 1939. Barkhill offered 18 acres of land for playing fields and further development with buildings facing south overlooking the Mersey to the Wirral and Welsh hills. No longer did first-year students have to travel by bicycle 5 miles to play games in Sandown, Wavertree, or Sefton parks, or cycle to the pier head for the 2 p.m. ferry from Birkenhead to Chester to row to the Iron Bridge before catching the 9 p.m. ferry home. Students swam in Cornwallis Street and Guinea Gap baths, went horse-riding in Sefton Park or &#145;Henglers&#146;, and rowed on Southport Lake or the River Dee. The Myrtle gymnasium was used for practical work, lectures, and Thursday evening classes when local working girls participated in recreational activities. Students attended the technical college for lectures in hygiene and physiology and Liverpool University for anatomy demonstrations. Determined that students should be eligible to sit the examinations for the London University diploma in the theory and practice of physical education, inaugurated in 1930&#150;31, Marsh built a new laboratory at a cost of &pound;1000. In May 1936 three third-year students were awarded this diploma.<br>
<br>The development of a student's personality and creative ability was just as important to Marsh as the development of physical prowess. She quickly formed an insight into the ability and character of her students. The Victorian family atmosphere in which she had grown up was replicated in her college. Desirable qualities for entrants to the Liverpool Physical Training College were specified in 1917: intending students should be gentlewomen, of good social position, refined, with ease and charm of manner, a nice appearance, good taste in dress, a pleasant speaking voice with no trace of accent, educated at a high class public or private school, with an attainment of senior Oxford or Cambridge examinations or equivalent.<br>
<br>Direct in speech, but known for making fair judgements, Marsh shunned publicity. Nevertheless, through her vision and inspiration, and the continuous development of her understanding of physical education, the curriculum was steadily developed and the standing of the Liverpool college nationally recognized. She was an educationist in the widest sense of that word, whose generosity, charitable outlook, and strength of purpose made her one of the pioneers and leaders of women's physical education in the early twentieth century. During and after the First World War she was a district commissioner for the Girl Guides. She died, unmarried, at her home, 66 Barkhill Road, Aigburth, Liverpool, on 3 April 1938.<br>
