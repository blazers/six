<span class="headword">Williams,  Richard Dalton</span>  (1822&#150;1862), <span class="occ">poet</span>, born in Dublin on 8 October 1822, was the illegitimate son of Count D'Alton, the owner of extensive lands in co. Tipperary, and Mary Williams, a farmer's daughter. In 1828 he was taken to Grenanstown in Tipperary, at eight was sent to the Jesuit school of St Stanislaus at Tullabeg, and at fourteen was moved to St Patrick's College, Carlow.<br>
<br>In 1842 Williams began to send verses to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, and the &#145;Munster War Song&#146;, his first published contribution, appeared under the pseudonym Shamrock on 7 January 1843, with the support of the editor, Thomas Osborne Davis.<br>
<br>Williams moved to Dublin in March 1843 to study medicine at St Vincent's Hospital in St Stephen's Green, where he wrote two of his best-known ballads, &#145;The Sister of Charity&#146; and &#145;The Dying Girl&#146;, and composed the series of humorous verses, <span class="italic">The Misadventures of a Medical Student</span>. By this time he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, and as a result became involved with the Young Ireland movement. As the preface to his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was to declare, &#145;He gave his harp to Erin that he might make its inspiring strains ring out in the cause of liberty&#146;  (preface), and Williams published many stirring patriotic ballads in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and in <span class="italic">Duffy's Irish Catholic Magazine</span> under the pseudonyms Milton Byron Scraggs, the Haunted Man, the Jealous Stoneybatter Man and D.N.S. The famine of 1847 prompted some of his most powerful poems, such as &#145;Kyrie eleison&#146;, &#145;Lord of Hosts&#146;, and &#145;Extermination&#146;, which articulated his Mitchelite view of the famine as deliberate genocide. He began to publish in John Mitchel's <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>, and after Mitchel's conviction and its suppression, attempted to replace it. In June 1848 he brought out the <span class="italic">Irish Tribune</span> with a friend, Kevin Izod O'Doherty, but after six weekly issues it too was suppressed and Williams was brought to trial for treason-felony. He was successfully defended by Samuel Ferguson, after his father Count D'Alton concealed evidence connecting him to <span class="italic">The Tribune</span>.<br>
<br>After the failure of the 1848 rising, Williams resumed his medical studies in Edinburgh, obtaining his degree in 1849 and returning to Dublin to practise at Dr Steevens's hospital at the end of that year. Disillusioned by the political condition of Ireland, he emigrated to America in the summer of 1851 to take up the position of professor of <i>belles-lettres</i> at the Spring Hill Jesuit College, Mobile, Alabama. On 8 September 1856 he married Elizabeth Connolly, and moved to New Orleans to resume the medical profession, moving on to Thibordeaux, Louisiana, some years later. With Elizabeth Connolly he had three daughters and a son. He contributed poems to various American journals. Williams died of consumption in Thibordeaux on 5 July 1862, and a monument was erected over his grave by Irish American soldiers some years later. Williams's poems were never collected during his lifetime, but a selection was published as a supplement to the Christmas edition of <span class="italic">The Nation</span> in 1876. In the following year, it was issued in book form, which ran to a fifth edition by 1887. In 1877 a series of biographical articles on Williams appeared in the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, and in 1894 a revised <span class="italic">Complete Poems</span> appeared, with a memoir by P. A. Sillard, reissued in 1901.<br>
