<span class="headword">Bourne,  Robert</span>  (1761&#150;1829), <span class="occ">physician and chemist</span>, was born at Shrawley, Worcestershire, on 18 August 1761, the second son of Robert Bourne. He was educated at Bromsgrove grammar school and was elected a scholar at Worcester College, Oxford, on 1 July 1777. He took his BA in 1781 and was elected a fellow in 1784 on taking his MA. Following a period of training at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, he became BM in 1786, and DM in 1787, in which year he was elected honorary physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford, a post he held until 1824. According to family tradition he spent a year or longer in the Netherlands to further his knowledge of medicine and natural philosophy.<br>
<br>In September 1790 Bourne became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, to whom he delivered the Harveian oration in 1797. In 1794 he succeeded the disgraced Thomas Beddoes as reader in chemistry at Oxford, and he delivered a series of lectures at the Ashmolean Museum that year. His <span class="italic">Introductory Lecture</span> of 1797 shows that he stressed the need for a knowledge of chemistry among doctors. Like the lectures of Richard Watson at Cambridge, Bourne's lectures were designed to show how a knowledge of chemistry could be useful to students who would later inherit land, become MPs, or take an interest in manufactures and commerce. Understandably, however, given that Bourne's life was given over to medical practice, he made no contribution to the advancement of chemistry. He ceased his chemistry lectures in 1803 on the appointment of John Kidd to the newly endowed chair of chemistry and his own election as the first Aldrichian professor of physic. He resigned this chair in 1824 on election to the Lord Lichfield professorship of clinical medicine.<br>
<br>In 1795 Bourne had married Mary, daughter of James Burr of Spelsbury, Oxfordshire. They had two sons and two daughters. After his first wife's death he married Mary, the widow of the Revd James Griffith, master of University College. Bourne had a large medical practice in Oxford and its county and was active in the modernization of the Radcliffe Infirmary, of which he was a benefactor. He wore his hair in a pigtail long after it had ceased to be fashionable. His only published medical work appeared in 1805. It consisted of twenty-two case histories of pulmonary consumption, in which his treatment had been to use an astringent prepared from the bearberry, <i>A. uva-ursi</i>. Although he kept very careful records of all of his patients throughout his career, these histories were destroyed by his son in 1830. Bourne's great-grandson, Gilbert Charles Bourne, rowed at Oxford and was an anatomist there.<br>
<br>Bourne appears to have spent his entire career at Oxford, where he died after prolonged illness on 23 December 1829. An inscription to his memory was erected in Worcester College chapel and is reproduced in Munk's <span class="italic">Roll of the Royal College of Physicians</span>.<br>
