<span class="headword">Bankhead,  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1797&#150;1870), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was probably the son of Dr Charles Bankhead (<i>c</i>.1768&#150;1859), personal physician to Lord Castlereagh. Bankhead began his diplomatic career as a clerk to The Hague from 5 July 1814 to 5 January 1815 and then worked at St Petersburg from June 1820 to December 1822 and again from December 1824 to June 1825. In 1826 he was transferred to Washington as secretary of legation. He served as charg&eacute; d'affaires for long periods during the 1830s while the British minister, Sir Charles Vaughan (1774&#150;1849), was on leave of absence in Britain. He took part in the continuing negotiations over the north-eastern boundary dispute between Maine and Canada and was instrumental behind the scenes in resolving the crisis in 1835&#150;6 between France and the United States over unpaid indemnities owed to the latter. He was relieved in 1836 by Henry Stephen Fox (1791&#150;1848), who had been appointed minister-plenipotentiary.<br>
<br>Bankhead's next assignment was in 1838 as secretary of embassy in Constantinople; then in 1843 he was transferred to Mexico as minister-plenipotentiary. He arrived in March 1844 and was confronted by a deepening crisis in Mexican&#150;American relations. Texas, formerly a province of Mexico, had overthrown Mexican rule and established an independent republic in 1836. Mexico had refused to conclude a treaty with Texas and for years Britain had tried to mediate a settlement between the two states as part of a wider strategy of maintaining Texan independence. Bankhead was instrumental in persuading Mexico to recognize Texas in 1845; however, when given the choice between annexation to the United States or independence, Texas opted for the former. This led directly to war between the United States and Mexico, and Bankhead was instructed to offer mediation by Britain, which was rejected by both parties. He was, however, able to facilitate communication between the adversaries during the conflict.<br>
<br>Bankhead was also active in promoting British commercial interests in Mexico, and at one time advocated an ambitious colonization scheme in California to prevent the province from falling under American control. He also believed that a European-sponsored monarchy would be a solution to Mexico's political instability. Neither suggestion, however, was followed up by the British government. Bankhead left Mexico on 19 October 1847 owing to illness and retired officially from the diplomatic service on 6 April 1851. He died at his home, 8 St James's Street, London, on 11 March 1870.<br>
