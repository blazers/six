<span class="headword">Penty,  Arthur Joseph</span>  (1875&#150;1937), <span class="occ">architect and social thinker</span>, was born at 16 Elmwood Street, St Laurence, York, on 17 March 1875, the second son of Walter Green Penty (1852&#150;1902), architect, and his wife, Emma Seller. After attending St Peter's School in York he was apprenticed in 1888 to his father. Working in the leading architectural firm in late Victorian York, he attracted national and even international attention, including favourable notice in Herman Muthesius's <span class="italic">Das englische Haus</span> (1904).<br>
<br>While still in Yorkshire Penty worked to compensate for his short school career through membership of the Plato group and the Theosophical Society. He became politically active in the late 1890s, joining the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society. Through these organizations he began his intellectual partnership with A. R. Orage, with whom he collaborated in setting up the Leeds Arts Club, an eclectic lecture and discussion group. His professional and intellectual interests coalesced in his support for the arts and crafts movement.<br>
<br>Penty decided to leave his father's office in 1901, and moved to London in 1902 to pursue his interest in the arts and crafts movement. His younger brother Frederick T. Penty (1879&#150;1943) took over the business after their father died. From 1902 to 1908 Penty struggled to make a living with intermittent work in architecture and furniture design, and, from 1906 to 1907, as a furniture restorer in New York. Throughout this time he read voraciously and wrote extensively, especially in the journal <span class="italic">The New Age</span>. In 1908 he started to work for Raymond Unwin on the Hampstead Garden Suburb development, especially Temple Fortune, for which Edwin Lutyens was consultant architect; he remained with Unwin until 1914. On 15 January 1916 he married Violet Leonard Pike (1885&#150;1978), a graduate of Vassar College he had first met at the Fabian summer school in 1908, and the daughter of Henry Harvey Pike, sugar importer. They had three children, Michael, Richard, and Mary. During the First World War Penty worked for London county council (in the housing department), the London Underground (in the advertising section), and the Coal Control. After the war he had a number of short-term architectural jobs, but concentrated increasingly on social and political thought, and his writing.<br>
<br>Penty's social criticism developed through a total of thirteen books and a substantial corpus of articles and reviews in a wide variety of publications, including <span class="italic">The Guildsman</span>, the <span class="italic">Guild Socialist</span>, <span class="italic">G. K.'s Weekly</span>, <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, the <span class="italic">New Witness</span>, <span class="italic">The Crusader</span>, and the <span class="italic">American Review</span>. He elaborated a thoroughgoing critique of industrialism in its social, economic, and aesthetic aspects, and posited an alternative inspired by the agrarianism and craftsmanship of the middle ages. He acknowledged the influence of Ruskin, Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, and Edward Carpenter, and exchanged ideas with such like-minded associates as the Catholic intellectuals Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton, the Spanish conservative Ramiro de Maeztu, and the Ceylonese art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. He was also impressed by the anti-industrialism of Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. His <span class="italic">Old Worlds for New</span> (1917) was a reply to H. G. Wells's <span class="italic">New Worlds for Old</span> (1907). In <span class="italic">A Guildsman's Interpretation of History</span> (1920) he criticized the historical philosophy of linear progress and made the case for a reversion to simpler modes of social and economic organization. An Anglican, he set out the religious basis of his thought in <span class="italic">Towards a Christian Sociology</span> (1923).<br>
<br>For Penty a society's morality was expressed in its buildings. Consequently, his social theory was largely an extension of his architectural thinking. While earlier medievalists had supported the Victorian Gothic revival, Penty favoured the vernacular, or Queen Anne style, which he regarded as the legitimate successor to Gothic in the English architectural tradition. He published his ideas on the vernacular in <span class="italic">The Elements of Domestic Design</span> (1930).<br>
<br>This fusion of politics and aesthetics gradually separated Penty from his earlier political attachments. In 1902 he had an acrimonious exchange on architectural issues with the leading Fabian George Bernard Shaw. Later that year he clashed with Fabian Society secretary E. R. Pease over what he saw as the philistine architectural criteria for the design of the London School of Economics building. In 1907 Penty helped establish the Fabian Arts Group, but tensions between the group and the parent society led to its demise within four years.<br>
<br>As a result of such experiences Penty rejected mainstream collectivist socialism and sought alternatives that he considered to be more respectful of individualism, spirituality, and the arts. His first book, <span class="italic">The Restoration of the Gild System</span> (1906), did much to inspire the guild socialist movement that found expression in the National Guilds League after 1915. Penty broke with the league in 1920 over its increasingly Marxist ideology and its acceptance of industrial production methods following the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.<br>
<br>The organizations to which Penty was subsequently affiliated included the Christian socialist Crusader League, which he helped to launch in 1923. In 1926 he contributed to the formation of the Rural Reconstruction Association, which championed agrarian revivalism as a programme of job creation and social reform. He was intrigued by the distributist ideas of Chesterton and Belloc, but criticized the Distributist League for its belief in unqualified private property rights. By the early 1930s Penty was attracted to the anti-modernism of the far right. He admired the corporatist economic organization of Mussolini's Italy, supported the nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, and interested himself in the ideas of Oswald Mosley. At the same time he denounced Italian imperialism in Abyssinia and rejected Nazism for its racial doctrines and its statism.<br>
<br>Penty died of heart disease at his home, 59 Church Street, Old Isleworth, Middlesex, on 19 January 1937; his wife survived him. In the academic literature he appears mainly as an original but ultimately marginal figure in the history of guild socialism. More positive assessments came from contemporaries outside the socialist fold. G. K. Chesterton in his preface to Penty's <span class="italic">Post-Industrialism</span> described him as &#145;one of the two or three truly original minds of the modern world&#146;  (1922, 7), and T. S. Eliot in <span class="italic">The Idea of a Christian Society</span> admiringly referred to him as a vigorous twentieth-century proponent of the Ruskinian tradition  (Eliot, 31).<br>
