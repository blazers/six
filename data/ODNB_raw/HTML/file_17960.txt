<span class="headword">Manners, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1354), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was the son of Sir Robert de Manners, whose family had owned Etal in north Northumberland since at least 1232. He was appointed among the commissioners of truce between England and Scotland in January 1328, probably to represent the interest of the bishop of Durham as lord of Norhamshire and Islandshire, outliers of the regalian liberty of Durham. After the renewal of hostilities he was appointed in 1334 as sheriff of Selkirk and keeper of Selkirk Forest, ceded to Edward III by Edward Balliol as king of Scots. In 1335 and again in 1344 he was appointed commissioner of array in the Glendale ward of north Northumberland. In 1340 he was MP for Northumberland, in which year he aided Thomas Grey of Heaton and others in stopping a raid of the earl of Sutherland. In 1341 he was allowed to crenellate Etal. In the following year he was appointed as a commissioner of truce and peace with Scotland, and when the Scots invaded England, in alliance with the French, in 1346, he took part in the battle of Nevilles Cross. For his services he received lands in Berrington and Buckton in Northumberland, and two parts of Paxton in Berwickshire. He also acquired lands in Goswick and Kyloe. In 1345 he endowed a chantry in Etal chapel. He died on 28 September 1354, and was buried at Ford church, Northumberland. His inquisition <i>post mortem</i> (November 1354) notes that he held Etal as a manor for a half knight's fee, and that its assets included a corn mill, a fulling mill, lime kilns, and mines of coal. He married first Ada (<i>d</i>. 1344/5), and second Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1362). His heir was his son John, born in 1354.<br>
<br>The second <a name="cosubject_17960"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Manners</span>  (1408&#150;1461)<span class="occ"></span> was probably the great-nephew of Sir John Manners and great-great-grandson of the earlier Sir Robert. His father was Sir John Manners of Etal and his mother was Margery, widow of Edward Ilderton. He was a justice of the peace for Norhamshire in 1438, when he succeeded to the family property, was sheriff of Northumberland in 1454, and MP for Northumberland in 1459. He died in 1461. His wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1488), was sister of Robert, first Baron Ogle (<i>d</i>. 1469). There were four sons, including Gilbert, John, and Sir Robert Manners, one of the few substantial supporters of the Yorkist cause in Northumberland, who served as sheriff of that county in 1463 and undersheriff to the earl of Northumberland in 1485. He married Eleanor, daughter of Lord Ros, thereby bringing that title into the Manners family. One of Robert and Eleanor's grandsons was Thomas Manners, created earl of Rutland in 1525.<br>
