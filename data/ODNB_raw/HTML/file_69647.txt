<span class="headword">Smart,  George</span>  (1750/51?&#150;1818?), <span class="occ">musical instrument maker and music publisher</span>, was possibly born in London. He attained proficiency on the violin, double bass, and clarinet. Evidently a gifted musician, he was possibly the Smart who appears on the records of Covent Garden as early as 22 September 1760 as a band member earning 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. daily, although confusion regarding specific details has arisen and persisted owing to the number of musicians simply named Smart who appear in records from the second half of the eighteenth century. The subject of this article was employed from the early 1770s at James Bremner's music shop in New Bond Street before assisting William Napier, a viola player whose music shop was at 474 Strand. He set up his own business as a musical instrument maker and music seller and publisher at the corner of Conduit Street, near Savile Row, in 1773 or 1774. In December 1774 he relocated to the corner of Argyll Street, at 331 Oxford Street, where he remained &#145;until sometime during the early nineteenth century&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Smart published and edited collections of popular music, mainly songs and dances, and he is the only known maker of the &#145;sticcado-pastorale&#146;, a &#145;percussion idiophone made of glass&#146; or &#145;crystallophone&#146;  (King): there is an example signed by Smart and dated about 1775.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Smart continued to perform, appearing at Drury Lane as a clarinettist and violinist and on the double bass at the Handel memorial concerts in June 1784. Having been rejected by the Royal Society of Musicians in 1785, possibly because he practised a second profession or because &#145;he had reported four children when his wife was pregnant with a fifth&#146;  (Ehrlich, 29), Smart founded, along with Edward Miller, a rival friendly society which accepted provincial members. The New Musical Fund was set up on 16 April 1786. He served as a member of its court of assistants and as treasurer from 1794 to 1815. There were also performances in Johann Peter Salomon's concert series, the band of the King's Theatre, and the Concerts of Ancient Music.<br>
<br>According to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, Smart also entered the brewery business with his son Henry, but without great success. His children with his wife Ann Embrey (<i>d</i>. 1818) included at least three prominent musicians: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25740/', "George Thomas Smart (1776&#150;1867)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25741/', "Henry Smart (1778&#150;1823)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25740/', "Smart, Sir George Thomas")</script>], and <a name="cosubject_69648"></a><span class="headword">Charles Frederick Smart</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1780)<span class="occ"></span>. At least two of them appeared with their father, as &#145;Smart and Sons&#146;, in the band that played for Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span> under Samuel Arnold and Fran&ccedil;ois Hippolyte Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon at the Haymarket on 15 January 1798. Charles Frederick was a <span class="occ">singer</span> and a well-known double bass player in London orchestras and was living in his father's house at 331 Oxford Street in 1794. Some doubt surrounds the date and place of George Smart's death. Nicholas Temperley has suggested that Smart died about 1805, but another authority cites F. Cansick's <span class="italic">A Collection of Curious and Interesting Epitaphs</span> (1869&#150;72), which quoted Smart's memorial inscription at St James's Chapel, Hampstead Row, London, stating that he died, aged sixty-seven, in Edinburgh on 4 September 1818  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Smart's wife died on 19 October 1818 and was buried beside him at St James's Chapel. The subscribers to the New Musical Fund paid for his memorial tablet there.<br>
