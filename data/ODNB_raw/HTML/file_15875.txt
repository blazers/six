<span class="headword">Laffan, Sir  Robert Michael</span>  (1819&#150;1882), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of John Laffan of Skehanagh, co. Clare, and his wife, Susan (or Susanna), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kerin (<i>d</i>. 1852), was born on 14 August 1819. Educated at the college of Pontlevoy, near Blois, France, he went to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in September 1835, and on 5 May 1837 was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>After two years at Chatham and Woolwich, and becoming first lieutenant on 1 April 1839, Laffan was sent to south Africa and employed in frontier service. He was one of the officers summoned by the governor, Sir George Napier, to plan the relief of Colonel Smith and the garrison of Natal, then beleaguered by Boers under Pretorius. Laffan organized the engineering arrangements of the expedition under Sir Josiah Cloete, which relieved the British garrison.<br>
<br>From the Cape, Laffan was sent to Mauritius, where he was promoted captain on 1 May 1846. On his return home in 1847 he was appointed commanding royal engineer at Belfast, and at the close of the year was nominated an inspector of railways under the Board of Trade, an office he held until 1852. On 29 April 1852 he married Emma, daughter of W. Norsworthy. They had one daughter and four sons, and she survived him. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104187/', "Robert Stuart de Courcy Laffan")</script>, became an early promoter of the Olympic movement.<br>
<br>In July 1852 Laffan was elected Conservative MP for St Ives. He retained the seat until March 1857. In the autumn of 1852 he was sent to Paris and Antwerp to report on their defences for Sir John Burgoyne, inspector-general of fortifications. In 1854 he was appointed commanding royal engineer in the London district, and in 1855 he was sent by the duke of Newcastle, secretary of state for war, with two others to report on the organization of the French ministry of war. On his return to England in May 1855 Laffan was appointed deputy inspector-general of fortifications. He was promoted major on 26 October 1858 and lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1859.<br>
<br>From 1858 to 1860 Laffan was on sick leave in the south of France and Switzerland. On his return he was stationed at Portsmouth for a short time, but in late 1860 he was sent to Malta as commanding royal engineer. He remained there for five years, during which the armament of the defences was modernized. He was promoted brevet colonel on 28 November 1864.<br>
<br>In 1865 Laffan was sent to Ceylon as a member of a commission on its defence and also reported to the secretary of state for war on the Suez Canal. In 1866 he was appointed commanding royal engineer at Aldershot, where he devised manoeuvres and transformed the appearance of the camp by planting trees and grass: the former Queen's Birthday Parade was later renamed Laffan's Plain in his memory. In January 1872 he was sent to Gibraltar as commanding royal engineer, and remained there five years.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1877 Laffan was appointed governor of the Bermudas, arriving on 7 August. On 30 May the same year he was made a KCMG, and on 2 October 1877 was promoted major-general (antedated to 8 February 1870). He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 July 1881.<br>
<br>Laffan's ability made him a popular and successful governor of the Bermudas at a critical time in the political history of the colony. He restored relations with the assembly, reformed local government, and reorganized the colony's defences amid rumours of impending Fenian attack. Laffan died in Bermuda, at Mount Langton, on 22 March 1882. He was buried at St John's Church, Pembroke, Bermuda, two days later.<br>
