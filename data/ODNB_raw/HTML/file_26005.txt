<span class="headword">Somerset,  Edward</span>, fourth earl of Worcester  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1628), <span class="occ">nobleman and courtier</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26015/', "William Somerset, third earl of Worcester (1526/7&#150;1589)")</script>, and his first wife, Christian North (<i>b</i>. 1533), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20300/', "Edward North, first Lord North")</script>. The Somersets were a grand marcher family who staunchly supported the Tudors and lived in expansive medieval style at Raglan Castle. In December 1571 Lord Herbert, as Edward was styled, married Elizabeth Hastings (<i>d</i>. 1621), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12566/', "Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon")</script>, with whom he had at least five sons and six daughters. Their third surviving son was the traveller and writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68781/', "Sir Charles Somerset (1587/8&#150;1665)")</script>. He succeeded his father as earl of Worcester in February 1589 and in May 1590 was sent to congratulate James VI of Scotland on his return from Denmark with his bride, also informing James that he had been nominated a knight of the Garter along with Henri IV. Worcester and James struck up a friendship that later became significant. In December 1590 he became a member of the council in the marches of Wales. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1591, created MA by Oxford University in 1592, and elected knight of the Garter in 1593. In December 1597 Worcester was appointed deputy master of the horse in the absence of the earl of Essex, and in June 1600 he was a member of the court of peers who heard the charges against Essex after his return from Ireland.<br>
<br>On 8 February 1601 Worcester was sent with three senior privy councillors to Essex House to demand why men were assembling there. The four were kept under guard for three hours while Essex attempted to raise London against his enemies at court. Worcester's eyewitness account of events formed part of the indictment of Essex and Southampton; after being sentenced to death Essex asked his pardon for holding him prisoner. In April 1601 Elizabeth appointed Worcester her master of the horse. He was promoted to the privy council in June and made joint commissioner of Essex's former office of earl marshal in December. He became lord lieutenant of Monmouthshire and Glamorgan in July 1602.<br>
<br>Worcester rose to even greater favour under James VI and I. As earl marshal he oversaw the coronation in July 1603, the baptism of Princess Mary in 1605, and the unique ceremony creating Prince Henry prince of Wales during the parliamentary session of 1610. He became master of the horse for life in January 1604, and was sufficiently competent as a huntsman to accompany the king daily in the field at Royston and Newmarket. However, Worcester tended to weary of the interminable chase and on occasion longed for the summer break when he could retire to Raglan. On these hunting sojourns he frequently acted as one of the royal secretaries, writing to the privy council and particularly to Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, with details of James's views, mood, and state of health. The king valued Worcester's advice and regarded him as one of his &#145;honest society&#146; of leading privy councillors, along with Salisbury, Northampton, and Suffolk  (<span class="italic">Letters of King James VI and I</span>, 271). In 1610 these trusted four peers debated with James at Theobalds on the last stages of the negotiation of the great contract, and later, in November 1610, they made every effort to obtain parliamentary taxation after the king authorized them to accept any reasonable offer from the House of Commons.<br>
<br>After the Reformation, generations of the Somerset clan were divided over religion. Worcester was impeccably conformist, taking the oath of allegiance to the royal supremacy and attending sermons at court. He was placed on a commission for the expulsion of the Jesuits in September 1604. In May&#150;June 1605 he was sent to Raglan, after a period of riotous disturbances in the marches, to summon his county neighbours, including the bishop of Hereford, and urge them to greater efforts in establishing true religion and suppressing recusancy. Later in 1605 he was employed in the interrogation of the gunpowder plotters in the Tower. Yet in 1592 he gave shelter at Raglan to the Jesuit superior Robert Jones, and about 1600 granted the order some Welsh lands and farms. His wife was widely regarded as a Catholic. The earl employed as his children's tutor the noted Welsh protestant Thomas Pritchard, but several if not all of them grew up to be crypto-Catholics who revealed their sympathies on their tours of Europe or visits to Spa near Li&egrave;ge, a resort of Catholic &eacute;migr&eacute;s. Worcester escorted the Catholic-leaning Anne of Denmark to Bath in 1613, and his younger son Thomas served as her master of the horse.<br>
<br>After the death in 1612 of his ally Salisbury, whose private funeral he attended, Worcester became one of the six commissioners for the treasury. Thereafter his career stalled, since his access to the king dwindled with the rise after 1611 of the favourite Sir Robert Carr. By 1614 it was rumoured that he would have to forfeit the mastership of the horse; he surrendered it in January 1616 but received an annuity of &pound;1500 as compensation. He was also given the office of lord privy seal for life, and continued to be named to various commissions, including that which examined Ralegh in 1618 after the Guiana voyage. In 1621 he was appointed judge of requests, and though there were frequent rumours that he would relinquish the post of lord privy seal to make way for a client of Buckingham, he retained it until his death.<br>
<br>Worcester was a cultivated man who supported a theatre company. He completed the suite of grand state rooms at Raglan begun by his father, modernizing the castle's living quarters, and was probably responsible for the recasting of part of the moat into a sunken promenade with shell-lined niches for statues of Roman emperors. His extensive rents benefited from the developing coal industry in Glamorgan, and his tenants were obliged to carry coal to Raglan as part of their leases. Less successful, however, was his patent for the sole making of gunpowder and saltpetre in England, granted in May 1607 and extended to include exports of powder in 1610, but withdrawn in February 1620 after numerous complaints. Worcester's last significant appearance was in February 1626 as lord great chamberlain at the coronation of Charles I. He died at Worcester House in Westminster on 3 March 1628 and was buried on 30 March at Raglan parish church, but his monument there was destroyed in 1646 along with other family tombs.<br>
