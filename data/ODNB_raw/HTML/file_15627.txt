<span class="headword">Kingston,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [Doctor Kingston]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1710?), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, was the son of a farmer in Northamptonshire, and apprenticed to a tailor. According to his own statements he was an MA of both Oxford and Cambridge&#151;there is no record of him at either&#151;and was ordained by the bishop of Galloway on 17 July 1662 at Westminster. Bishop Jonathan Trelawny told the House of Lords in 1708 that Kingston had worked as a tailor in London until the great plague of 1665, when he found some sermons and began preaching. He was chosen minister at St James's, Clerkenwell, that year by the congregation, as his loud preaching impressed them, after the incumbent had fled from the plague. His successor there was licensed on 17 September 1666. From 1666 to about 1670 Kingston was vicar of St Peter's, Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, through the patronage of Nicholas Knollys, third earl of Banbury. Kingston married first Elizabeth Webb at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 28 January 1668; she gave birth to twin girls in Irthlingborough that November. After separating from his first wife, in 1671 he eloped with a daughter of Arthur Leonard (<i>d</i>. 1671), rector of Boughton, Northamptonshire. She may have been his bigamous second wife, also called Elizabeth. In 1699 he claimed to be the father of nine children, mainly daughters. In 1680 he received the living of Henbury in Gloucestershire, worth &pound;50 a year, perhaps by having bought the right to present one incumbent. In 1700 he printed letters supposedly showing that on 6 February 1682 he was made chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles II, but he does not appear in Edward Chamberlayne's list of royal chaplains for that year. He also later claimed to have graduated DD, hence his subsequent style of &#145;Dr Kingston&#146;. He also claimed that a prebend and a rectory were added to Henbury. He was not &#145;R. K.&#146;, rector of Raydon in Suffolk, who published a sermon in 1688, as this was Roger Kelsall. Kingston also states that he suffered for preaching against Roman Catholics. By his own account he remained at Henbury, where he had a small estate, until the revolution of 1688, when he sold his property and moved to London. He then ceased to wear clerical dress, probably because Trelawny had discovered he was an impostor and expelled him from the diocese of Bristol.<br>
<br>Kingston became active in the London Jacobite movement, writing letters to the court of James II on behalf of several aristocrats and political clubs, and probably composing treasonable pamphlets for the press. However, in May 1692 he was exposed by the government spy John Macky, and began to work for the government. On 1 June he gave the earl of Portland an account of English plotting for the projected French and Jacobite invasion, and was the single secret witness on whose oath the government continued to detain several Jacobites after the crisis was over. Kingston became a trusted and valued government spy. His reports were generally unsensational, in contrast to other informers, avoiding the accusations against tory ministers which characterized other reports, and in 1692&#150;3 warning the secretary of state, Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham, of plots against him. He temporarily had access to disaffected circles as high as that of Princess Anne of Denmark and John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, to add to his encyclopaedic knowledge of lesser-ranking plotters. He passed on information about Jacobite activities, noting journeys and correspondence between Jacobites in England and France, and the plans of the Jacobite press in London. He was promised ecclesiastical preferment by Archbishop John Tillotson as a reward for his spying, but Archbishop Thomas Tenison discovered he was an impostor. By the time he was reporting to Sir William Trumbull, secretary of state, from mid-1695 to 1697, few leading Jacobites trusted him; although he was still well-regarded by enough minor Jacobites to remain valuable to the government, his espionage ended when the government ordered him to testify in three successful minor treason trials.<br>
<br>In 1698 Kingston published <span class="italic">A True History of the Several Designs Against his Majesties Sacred Person and Government from 1688 to 1697</span>. This semi-official history of Jacobite conspiracies was intended to influence the controversy over disbanding the army, and prove that the perjurer John Lunt's &#145;Lancashire plot&#146; of 1694 was genuine. The most valuable part of the book consists of the state papers provided to Kingston by Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, and never returned. Despite these propaganda services his government pension fell into arrears and he suffered extreme poverty. A petition from him dated 14 July 1699 states that &pound;600 was due to him, that he had assisted as a witness at the conviction of three traitors, had brought &pound;1225 into the Treasury by the seizure of French silks, and that he had printed thirteen books on behalf of the government at his own expense. He received &pound;200 royal bounty in 1700.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Modest Answer to Captain Smith's Immodest Memorial of Secret Service</span> (1700) Kingston attacked Matthew Smith, another former spy, who had just published his <span class="italic">Memoirs of Secret Service</span> (1699), which falsely implied that Shrewsbury had betrayed William III, and a violent controversy ensued. Kingston attributed Smith's work to the satirist Tom Brown (1663&#150;1704), whom he described as &#145;a rank prostituted Jacobite&#146;  (<span class="italic">Modest Answer</span>, 7). Smith responded by charging Kingston with having forged his letters of orders and with various immoral activities. Kingston countered these allegations in a rejoinder by publishing an account of his life, <span class="italic">Impudence, Lying and Forgery Detected and Chastiz'd</span> (1700), with letters of support and testimonials and a certificate signed by one Thomas Beesly, asserting that he had been ordained with Kingston. However, his testimony was not wholly plausible on account of there being a discrepancy over the name of the ordaining bishop, and the fact that by 1700 Beesly had been dead for three years.<br>
<br>In 1707 Kingston published an attack on John Freind's vindication of the conduct of Smith's former patron, Charles Mordaunt, third earl of Peterborough, in Spain, and he was promptly arrested by an order of the House of Lords. He was released on 19 January 1708, but the attorney-general was instructed to prosecute him. He also intervened in the controversy which raged in 1707&#150;9 about the so-called French Prophets, a millenarian group, complaining in his book <span class="italic">Enthusiastic Imposters No Divinely Inspired Prophets</span> that, like hell, the French Prophets sect refused no one. Kingston published three sermons, one on the plague, and ten other religious and political works. He may have been the Richard Kingston &#145;late of Chelsea College&#146;, who died in 1710  (TNA: PRO, PROB 6/86).<br>
