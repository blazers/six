<span class="headword">Kirbye,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">composer</span>, first emerges in 1592 as a major contributor to Thomas East's psalter. By 1597 he was a domestic musician in the service of Sir Robert Jermyn of Rushbrooke Hall, near Bury St Edmunds, and in that year he published his <span class="italic">First Set of English Madrigalls, to 4, 5, and 6 Voyces</span>, which comprised twenty-four pieces dedicated to two of Sir Robert's daughters, for whose &#145;delight &amp; contentments&#146; Kirbye had originally composed them. Rushbrooke was close to Hengrave Hall where one of the greatest of the English madrigalists, John Wilbye, was also in service, and the two men must have been acquainted; significantly, perhaps, Wilbye provided one of only two instances of another composer setting a text already used by Kirbye. In 1601 Kirbye contributed a madrigal to <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span>, the collection of madrigals in honour of the ageing Queen Elizabeth, but he published no further volume of his own, though eighteen more madrigals by him survive in manuscript sources. On 16 February 1598 he had married Anne Saxye (<i>d</i>. 1626) at nearby Bradfield St George. There seem to have been no children from the marriage. Nothing more is known of Kirbye until 1626, when he was living in Whiting Street in Bury St Edmunds, where he was evidently churchwarden at St Mary's Church; during the next two years his name appears in the parish registers.<br>
<br>Though Kirbye's date of birth remains unknown, it was probably some time before 1570, for clearly eight of his works surviving in manuscript sources were in fact viol-accompanied solo songs more typical of the earlier years of Elizabeth's reign, though with words subsequently fitted to the string parts to make them resemble madrigals, and this points to a date of composition no later than the 1580s, and very probably earlier. Even the contents of Kirbye's single published madrigal volume hint at a composer no longer in his first youth, for these are little marked by the bright, lively manner newly paraded in Thomas Morley's volumes of the earlier 1590s, and they set no light verse; instead they favour a generally more serious aesthetic and all are in a minor mode. But Kirbye had certainly become familiar with Italian madrigals, and for his published collection the madrigals (and especially those of Luca Marenzio) which had been printed with English words in the anthologies of Nicholas Yonge (<span class="italic">Musica transalpina</span>, 1588) and Thomas Watson (<span class="italic">Italian Madrigals Englished</span>, 1590) seem to have been his prime models. Kirbye's own examples reveal an admirable and inventive artisan, fluent and tasteful, who employed word-painting and chromaticism judiciously and who, while lacking those broader imaginative insights that marked the greatest of his contemporaries such as Wilbye, was able on occasions to produce moments that are truly memorable. Moreover, his <span class="italic">Oriana</span> contribution, &#145;With Angel's Face&#146; (published in the first edition with a different text: &#145;Bright Phoebus Greets&#146;), shows that he could also confidently command a more brilliant, extrovert style.<br>
<br>Kirbye was buried in St Mary's, Bury St Edmunds, on 6 October 1634 and his will reveals that he was by then a man of some substance. Three of his madrigals survive as &#145;contrafacta&#146; (that is, with sacred texts substituted). In addition, a small quantity of church music by him is extant, as is a single instrumental pavan, though most of these pieces survive incomplete.<br>
