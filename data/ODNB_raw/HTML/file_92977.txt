<span class="headword">Doreward,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1420), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons and royal councillor</span>, inherited estates from his parents, William Doreward and Joan, daughter and heir of John Oliver of Stanway. Situated mainly in eastern Essex and focused on Bocking, they were estimated in 1412 to be worth &pound;135 a year. Having trained as a lawyer, from the early 1380s Doreward was engaged on commissions of local government and as a JP, and his reputation led to appointment as steward of the liberties of Bury St Edmunds Abbey. He was married three times: to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Rochford; to Katherine (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>. 1397), daughter and coheir of Sir Walter Walcot of Gunton, Norfolk; and, in 1399, to Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1426), sister of Richard Baynard of Messing (a future speaker), and widow of Walter Bygood of Alfriston.<br>
<br>Doreward's lifelong friendship with Thomas Coggeshall of Boreham led before 1387 to his entry into the circles of Joan de Bohun, dowager countess of Hereford, and her son-in-law Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester. In February 1395, during the first of the six parliaments in which Doreward represented Essex, he and Coggeshall, his fellow shire knight, were both named by the duke as his attorneys, and the following year the two men witnessed a conveyance by the duke and duchess to their collegiate chapel in Pleshey Castle. Doreward also came to the notice of Countess Joan's brothers, Richard (III) Fitzalan, fourth earl of Arundel (who granted him the manor of High Roding), and Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, whose name he included on the bede roll of the chantry he founded in Bocking church in 1397.<br>
<br>Richard II had good reason to doubt Doreward's loyalty, since he was closely associated with two of the former lords appellant of 1387&#150;8, and had himself benefited from their acts in the 1388 Merciless Parliament by securing lands forfeited by the king's friends. Immediately after the arrest of Gloucester and Arundel in the summer of 1397 Doreward was removed from his office as steward of Bury St Edmunds Abbey, and replaced by Sir John Bussy, one of the king's staunchest supporters. On 28 August he and Coggeshall were required to make loans to the king of 100 marks each, and in December they were appointed to the commission to levy the fine of &pound;2000 imposed on the commonalties of Essex and Hertfordshire for having demonstrated their support for Gloucester and Arundel, now both dead (the one murdered, the other executed). Doreward retained links with the widowed duchess of Gloucester, and his sympathies lay with her brother-in-law, Henry Bolingbroke, whom Richard II had exiled. In August 1399, when Henry seized power, Doreward was temporarily made sheriff of Essex, and he and his friend Coggeshall were returned to the last parliament summoned in Richard's name. At Westminster those elected learned of Richard's abdication on 30 September and then reassembled for Henry IV's first parliament on 6 October. On 15 October Sir John Cheyne was discharged as speaker, most likely because Archbishop Arundel had objected to him as an enemy of the church. Doreward was the Commons' second choice, perhaps because he was of proven orthodox opinions and clearly acceptable to the archbishop. The chief business of the session was to reverse the injustices of Richard II's last years.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1399, while still MPs, both Doreward and Coggeshall were appointed members of the new king's council, and allocated annual fees of 100 marks each. Henry IV rewarded Doreward's support by granting him for life the estates of the alien priory of West Mersea and the fee farm of Colchester (&pound;35 a year). During his fourth parliament, in 1404, he was one of the king's council formally named to the assembly, and he was summoned from Essex to attend great councils in 1401, 1403, and 1405. Many of his other activities stemmed directly from his position as a councillor: he served on commissions to determine appeals against judgments in the courts of chivalry, and arbitrated in serious disputes. Having made loans to aid royal garrisons in south Wales, in 1405 he negotiated for the submission of the rebels of Usk and Caerleon, and reported personally to the king on the state of affairs in the marches. Yet when the king's council was reconstituted in parliament in May 1406, Doreward and his fellow commoners were excluded. He subsequently agreed to waive the 200 marks owed for his salary in return for licences enabling him to make religious benefactions.<br>
<br>In May 1413, in the first parliament of Henry V's reign, Doreward led the delegation sent from the Commons to the king to inform him that the speaker, William Stourton, had acted without authorization in agreeing to put their complaints in writing, and when Stourton fell ill he replaced him as speaker, though he officiated for only a few days (3&#150;9 June) before the session ended. He sat in parliament for the last time in April 1414. In 1415 he was named by the king's brother Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, as a trustee of his estates, and acted similarly on behalf of the countess of Hereford, and her granddaughter Anne, countess of Stafford. His last appearance of importance was at a meeting of the council held by the duke of Bedford in January 1418, during Henry V's absence in France. Having made his will on 1 February 1418, Doreward died on 12 November 1420 and was buried at Bocking. He was survived by his wife, Isabel, his son and heir, John, and three daughters.<br>
