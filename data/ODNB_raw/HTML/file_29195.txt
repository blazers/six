<span class="headword">Wheler,  Robert Bell</span>  (1785&#150;1857), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Stratford upon Avon on 7 January 1785, the fourth child but only son of Robert Wheler (1742&#150;1819), a solicitor of that town. His mother was Elizabeth Loader (1756&#150;1786) of Quinton, Warwickshire, who died when he was only a year old. His forenames were derived from Robert Bell, who lodged with the Whelers until his death in 1802. He was the brother-in-law of Dionysius Bradley, a Stratford attorney, to whom Robert Wheler had been articled in 1777. Robert Bell Wheler was educated at the town's grammar school and was articled to his father in 1803. He appears scarcely to have left Stratford, except in 1812, when he went to London for a month at the date of his formal admission as a solicitor in the court of king's bench. He practised his profession at Stratford until his death, residing continuously in a house now known as Avoncroft in Old Town.<br>
<br>In youth Wheler joined the Stratford volunteer corps and in 1810 was commissioned as an ensign in the 3rd regiment of Warwickshire militia, stationed at Stratford; he later became lieutenant and quartermaster. But his main interest through life was in Shakespearian research and local topography. At the age of twenty-one he published his first book, <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Stratford-upon-Avon</span> (1806), the research for which had been completed, by his own account, three years earlier. This accurate and careful compilation, illustrated with his own accomplished sketches, though based largely on printed sources, included transcripts of, or reference to, several previously undiscovered documents relating to Shakespeare and his family. This was followed in 1814 by his <span class="italic">Guide to Stratford-upon-Avon</span>, in some respects an abridged version of his <span class="italic">History</span>, but incorporating additional discoveries he had since made concerning Shakespeare and other Stratford figures with Shakespearian associations. It also contained a rudimentary history of Shakespeare's birthplace, which was treated more fully in his final published work, <span class="italic">A Historical and Descriptive Account of the Birthplace of Shakespeare</span> (1824). Wheler also contributed articles, chiefly on Shakespearian subjects, to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. He was secretary to the committee which organized celebrations in Stratford to commemorate, in 1816, the bicentenary of Shakespeare's death, and, from 1820 to 1823, secretary and treasurer to another seeking to erect a &#145;mausoleum&#146; in the town in memory of the poet. He was a friend of the antiquary John Britton, and intimate with Captain James Saunders of Stratford, in conjunction with whom most of his research was undertaken. On Saunders's death in 1830, &#145;a great loss&#146; to him, Wheler's antiquarian activities, which had already been curtailed by his father's death in 1819, virtually ceased. He died unmarried on 15 July 1857 at his house, Avoncroft, in Old Town, Stratford and was buried six days later beside his father in the churchyard (Holy Trinity) of his native town.<br>
<br>Wheler left a quarto autograph manuscript volume of &#145;Collectanea de Stratford&#146;, containing personal anecdotes and many transcripts and notes, some from sources since lost, which has become a major source for the history of the town. This, together with his other notes and part of his library, his collection of local deeds and original documents, coins, and other relics local and Shakespearian, were given by his sister Anne Wheler (1783&#150;1870) to the trustees of Shakespeare's birthplace, and are now located in the record office of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Also of great importance is another autograph volume, now in the British Library, largely comprising copies from a lost manuscript history of Warwickshire by the antiquary Simon Archer (1581&#150;1662).<br>
