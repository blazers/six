<span class="headword">Carnell,  Edward John</span>  (1912&#150;1972), <span class="occ">science fiction writer, journal editor, and literary agent</span>, was born on 8 April 1912 in Plumstead, London, the only child of William John Carnell, a charge hand who worked at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, and his wife, Louisa Woollett.<br>
<br>Ted, as he was always known, became a printer, but joined the army at the outbreak of war in 1939, was promoted to sergeant, and served as a gunner in combined operations, when he was involved in more than one beachhead invasion. He was already devoted to the more peaceful microcosm of science fiction, and loved to tell the tale of how, patrolling the Mediterranean in a corvette, he had boarded a deserted ship; on the captain's desk lay a gold watch and a copy of <span class="italic">Astounding Science Fiction</span>. He took the latter.<br>
<br>Carnell attended Britain's first science fiction convention in 1937, together with other devotees who were later to succeed as writers, including Arthur C. Clarke and Eric Frank Russell. His administrative abilities soon came to the fore. He was made treasurer of a newly formed Science Fiction Association, and edited the journal of the British Interplanetary Society. After the war, with backing from dedicated followers, Carnell published <span class="italic">New Worlds</span>, Britain's most successful and long-lived science fiction magazine (200 issues between 1946 and 1970). As <span class="italic">New Worlds</span> achieved regular publication, Carnell added a sister magazine, <span class="italic">Science Fantasy</span> (eighty-one issues between 1950 and 1966). Later Carnell added a third magazine, the American-originated <span class="italic">Science Fiction Adventures</span>, which, through his intervention, survived when the parent magazine died, to yield twenty-seven issues between 1958 and 1963.<br>
<br>These magazines were crucial to the development of British science fiction: they allowed native writers to find their own audience, instead of having to adopt an American idiom for the New York market. Writers who took advantage of this, and supported Carnell, included Arthur Sellings, J. G. Ballard, Brian Aldiss, and Michael Moorcock&#151;the last taking over the editorship of <span class="italic">New Worlds</span> in 1964, when Carnell's health, and his publishers, were failing. Under Moorcock, <span class="italic">New Worlds</span> became as much a crusade as a magazine, while Carnell went on to lead a quieter life as editor of a regular series of anthologies, <span class="italic">New Writings in S-F</span>, which provided a forum for a generation of newer authors. Twenty-one numbers were published between 1964 and Carnell's death in 1972, whereupon H. Kenneth Bulmer&#151;another British stalwart&#151;took over the editorship.<br>
<br>Carnell also edited many anthologies: <span class="italic">No Place Like Earth</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Gateway to Tomorrow</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Gateway to the Stars</span> (1955), <span class="italic">The Best from New Worlds Science Fiction</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Lambda I and other Stories</span> (reprinted 1964), <span class="italic">Weird Shadows from Beyond</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">Best from New Writings in S-F 1&#150;4</span> (1971).<br>
<br>Carnell was always steady, reliable, and honest, and thoroughly understood routine science fiction. As his magazines and his writers succeeded, he was practically forced to become a literary agent in order to market the fiction he had summoned into being. Thus the E. J. Carnell Literary Agency was founded. He knew none of the techniques, but learned fast, representing such writers, in whole or in part, as John Christopher, Theodore Sturgeon, Damon Knight, Frederik Pohl, Samuel Delaney, Harry Harrison, and the British authors already mentioned. Carnell never failed to be surprised when he managed to sell a book to a regular publisher such as Faber and Faber, or to get &pound;30 from the Spanish. Then his high, nervous chuckle would come into play&#151;not always echoed by the more ambitious of his authors.<br>
<br>The science fiction world provided Carnell with his few recreations. He was chairman of the first world convention to be held outside the United States (London, 1957). He was one of the four founders of the respected international fantasy award in 1951, which immediately recognized the merits of such works as George Stewart's <span class="italic">Earth Abides</span> (1949) and the trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. Very little science fiction appeared in hardcover before the 1950s. Carnell helped promote hardcovers, becoming a founder and member, with Kingsley Amis and Dr George Porter, of the selection board of the Science Fiction Book Club, on which he served for many years. He was English linkman for the Trieste science fiction film festivals (1961 onwards), the first such international events. Throughout all this activity, Carnell remained a Plumstead man, modest and pleasant, a good friend to his friends and authors. Indisputably, he did more for British science fiction on the administrative side than anyone else. His was an example of the way in which devotees valiantly supported the literature no one but they seemed to love; his pleasant nature and fondness for &#145;loony&#146; jokes left their imprint on British science fiction.<br>
<br>In 1939 Carnell married Irene, daughter of William Henry Read Cloke, a caterer. They had a son and a daughter. Carnell died at St Nicholas Hospital, Plumstead, on 23 March 1972; his remains were cremated on 30 March at Falconwood cemetery, London.<br>
