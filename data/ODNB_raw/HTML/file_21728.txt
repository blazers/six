</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pease,  Edward</span>  (1767&#150;1858), <span class="occ">woollen manufacturer and railway promoter</span>, born at Darlington on 31 May 1767, was the eldest son of Joseph Pease, woollen manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Richardson. A brother, Joseph (1772&#150;1846), was one of the founders of the Peace Society in 1817, and a supporter of the Anti-Slavery Society, for which he wrote tracts in 1841 and 1842. Edward was educated at Leeds under Joseph Tatham the elder, and at the age of fifteen was placed in the woollen manufacturing business carried on by his father at Darlington. Pease married, on 30 November 1796, a fellow Quaker, Rachel, daughter of John Whitwell, of Kendal. They had five sons and three daughters. Rachel Pease died at Manchester on 18 October 1833.<br>
<br>In 1809 Pease became interested in a scheme for improving navigation on the lower reaches of the River Tees, a project which eventually bore fruit as the Stockton and Darlington Railway, linking collieries in south-west Durham with the London coastal trade in competition with established interests on the Tyne and the Wear. In 1818 preliminary steps were taken to obtain parliamentary sanction for the proposed railway, but the bill was thrown out owing to the opposition of the duke of Cleveland, near one of whose fox-covers the line was to run. In 1819 a new route was proposed, and the measure received royal assent on 19 April 1821.<br>
<br>Originally the railway was only intended to carry coal, and be drawn by horses; but in the spring of 1821 Pease recruited the Tyneside colliery engine-wright, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26397/', "George Stephenson")</script>, as engineer to the line. Stephenson was the foremost locomotive engineer of the day and it was due to his advocacy that Pease was persuaded of the efficiency of steam locomotive haulage on the projected railway.<br>
<br>Pease's role as the driving force behind the Stockton and Darlington Railway project was facilitated by his status as a Quaker entrepreneur with extensive familial contacts within the Quaker banking community in Norwich and London. Following the opening of the railway in September 1825, intermarriage within the Quaker &#145;cousinhood&#146;, reinforced by intra-family share transfers, resulted in the Pease family's emergence as the leading stockholders in the railway. Thus, despite its status as a publicly quoted company the Stockton and Darlington Railway soon aspired to the standing of a family-run firm.<br>
<br>Pease's role as provider of capital is well illustrated in his contribution to the founding of Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1823 as a purpose-built locomotive building establishment. Of the modest initial capital of &pound;4000, &pound;1600 was advanced by Pease, but he also loaned Robert Stephenson &pound;500 towards his own subscription.<br>
<br>Pease retired from active business life in 1833. He spent the remaining years of his life, as a notably &#145;plain&#146; Quaker, consumed with guilt about his worldly riches and worrying incessantly about his sons' business speculations. He died of heart failure at his residence, Northgate, Darlington, on 31 July 1858. His relations with George Stephenson and his son Robert remained cordial to the end of his life.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Lives of the Engineers</span>, Samuel Smiles described Pease as &#145;a thoughtful and sagacious man, ready in resources, possessed of indomitable energy and perseverance&#146;. His diaries were edited by his great-grandson Sir Alfred E. Pease in 1907. He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground, Skinnergate, Darlington.<br>
<br>The second son of Edward and Rachel Pease, <a name="cosubject_21730"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Pease</span>  (1799&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Quaker railway company promoter and industrialist</span>, was born at Darlington on 22 June 1799. Educated at Tatham's academy, Leeds, and Josiah Forster's academy, London, he subsequently aided his father in the projection of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, in 1819 and 1820 by preparing the company's first prospectus. He emerged as an influential voice in the management of the railway in 1828, when he took the lead in projecting an extension of the line from Stockton to the hamlet of Middlesbrough further down the Tees estuary. The effect of this development was twofold: first, to undermine the dominance of Tyne and Wear exporters in the London coastal market for coal; and, second, to lay the foundations for the emergence of Teesside as an outstanding centre for the production of iron. The latter was facilitated by Pease's in numerous railway projections in the north-east of England, all of them designed to open up the heavy mineral wealth of the region.<br>
<br>After the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1832, Joseph Pease was elected MP for South Durham, and retained the seat until his retirement in 1841. He was the first Quaker member to sit in the House of Commons, and on presenting himself on 8 February 1833 he refused to take the usual oath. A select committee was appointed to inquire into precedents, and on 14 February he was allowed to affirm  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 15, 1833, 387, 639). As a &#145;worldly&#146; Quaker, Joseph Pease was a frequent speaker on matters of social and political reform, always avoiding the use of titles when addressing the house, and retaining his Quaker dress.<br>
<br>Joseph Pease married, on 20 March 1826, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1860), daughter of Joseph Gurney of Norwich, and their surviving children comprised five sons and four daughters. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35447/', "Joseph Whitwell Pease (1828&#150;1903)")</script>, the eldest son, who was created a baronet on 18 May 1882, was MP for South Durham from 1865 to 1885, and subsequently for Barnard Castle. Arthur Pease (<i>d</i>. 1898), the third son, was MP for Whitby from 1880 to 1885, and for Darlington from 1895.<br>
<br>In addition to commercial and industrial issues, Joseph Pease devoted himself to philanthropic and educational work, aiding Joseph Lancaster, and acting as president of the Peace Society from 1860. Before 1865 he became totally blind, but, with the aid of his secretary, republished and distributed many Friends' books; and in 1870 he had the <span class="italic">Essays on the Principles of Morality</span> of Jonathan Dymond translated into Spanish, for which service the government of Spain conferred on him (2 January 1872) the grand cross of Charles III.<br>
<br>Joseph Pease died on 8 February 1872 at his Darlington home, Southend, from heart disease. He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground in Darlington on 10 February. At the time of his death Pease's industrial concerns employed nearly ten thousand men in collieries, quarries, and ironstone mines. In addition he owned and directed woollen manufactories and was a leading shareholder in Robert Stephenson &amp; Co., of Newcastle upon Tyne, numerous Teesside ironmaking concerns, and in the Middlesbrough estate.<br>
<br>Edward Pease's fifth son, <a name="cosubject_21729"></a><span class="headword">Henry Pease</span>  (1807&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Quaker railway company promoter</span>, was born at Darlington on 4 May 1807. He also entered with enthusiasm into the railway projects of his father. His principal achievement was the opening in 1861 of the line across Stainmoor, called &#145;the backbone of England&#146;, the summit of which was 1374 feet above sea level. It joined at Tebay the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), and was soon extended at its eastern limit to Saltburn-on-Sea. In January 1854 Pease was deputed by the meeting for sufferings, held on the 17th of that month, to accompany Joseph Sturge and Robert Charleton as a deputation from the Society of Friends to Russia. On 10 February they were received by the emperor Nicholas, and presented him with a powerful address, urging him to abstain from the then imminent Crimean War. He received them politely, but their efforts were unavailing, and Alexander William Kinglake ridiculed their action in his history of the campaign, <span class="italic">Invasion of the Crimea</span> (1863). Pease was MP for South Durham from 1857 to 1865. In 1867 he visited Napoleon III with a deputation from the Peace Society, but their request for permission to hold a peace congress during the Universal Exhibition in Paris was rejected.<br>
<br>Henry Pease married, on 25 February 1835, Anna, only daughter of Richard Fell of Uxbridge, who died on 27 October 1839, leaving a son, Henry Fell Pease, MP from 1885 for the Cleveland division of Yorkshire; second, on 19 January 1859, he married Mary, daughter of Samuel Lloyd of Wednesbury, with whom he had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Henry Pease was chairman of the first Darlington school board in 1871, first mayor of the town, and president of the Peace Society from 1872. In the early 1860s, when negotiations were in hand for a takeover of the Stockton and Darlington Railway by the North Eastern Railway Company (NER), Pease declared his opposition to the merger, in spite of the generous terms on offer to his family as leading shareholders in the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Following the takeover, however, Pease's sensibilities were overcome by his appointment as vice-chairman of the NER board. It was in that capacity that he presided over the railway jubilee held at Darlington on 27 September 1875, at which eighty British and thirty foreign railways were represented. He was always a prominent member of the Religious Society of Friends. He died at 23 Finsbury Square, London, while attending the yearly meeting, on 30 May 1881, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Darlington on 2 June.<br>
<br>Schools and a library were presented by members of the Pease family to Darlington, which benefited greatly from their benevolence until 1902, when the family fortunes were destroyed irrevocably as a result of the collapse of J. and J. W. Pease, the family counting house and banker to leading industrial enterprises in the north-east of England.<br>
