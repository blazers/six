<div class="para">
<span class="headword">William Augustus, Prince</span>, duke of Cumberland  (1721&#150;1765), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Leicester House, London, on 15 April 1721, the second surviving son of George, prince of Wales, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "George II")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4720/', "Caroline")</script>. The eldest son, Frederick, was still abroad in Hanover, estranged from his parents. Honours were showered on the infant William. At the age of four he was made a companion knight of the Bath, the first royal prince to be so elevated in the recently revived order. The following year, 1726, saw him ennobled as duke of Cumberland, marquess of Berkhampstead, earl of Kennington, Viscount Trematon, and baron of Alderney. At the coronation of his parents in 1727 the young duke walked at the head of the knights of the Bath. If anything, the arrival of his elder brother in England in 1728 led their parents, now king and queen of Great Britain, to be even more indulgent towards the younger son, to demonstrate their favouritism for him and their loathing of Frederick. In 1730 Cumberland was made knight of the Garter. The same year he apparently began to attend Westminster School, though his name is not included on the school lists and he continued to be educated also by his private tutor Jenkin Thomas Philipps. If the flattery of courtiers is to be believed he was a precocious pupil. Viscount Perceval recorded in his diary on 31 January 1731 that Cumberland was chided by his mother for not fasting the day before, the anniversary of the execution of Charles I. &#145;She asked him if he thought it was right in the people to have done it, to which he replied he could not tell what was his crime till he read his history&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.16).<br>
<br>In 1731 Cumberland was provided with his own establishment, with rooms set aside for him in all royal residences and an allowance of &pound;6000 a year. Stephen Poyntz was appointed as the governor and steward of his household. There were even indications that George II wished to separate the electorate of Hanover from the kingdom of Great Britain, by arranging for Cumberland to succeed as elector while his brother succeeded to the British crown. If this was the case, then it revived in amended form a proposal made by George II and Caroline when prince and princess of Wales, that Cumberland should succeed to Great Britain while Frederick would inherit the electorate. The scheme had faltered on the insistence of George I that it could only go ahead with Frederick's approval. According to Lord Hervey, Frederick was not averse to surrendering the electorate to his brother provided he received financial compensation, but Caroline would not hear of it and the project died with her. When she was on her deathbed in 1737 she urged Cumberland to &#145;show your gratitude to me in your behaviour to the King; be a support to your father and double your attention to make up for the disappointment and vexation he must receive from your profligate brother&#146;  (Hervey, 3.895).<h2>
<a name="Maturityandearlymilitarycareer"></a>Maturity and early military career</h2>When he reached eighteen Cumberland's allowance was increased to &pound;12,000 a year and he was given the use of a hunting lodge in Windsor Lodge. He was to prove a devotee of the chase and of the turf. It seems that he also began to sow his wild oats at this time, his name being associated with an actress, who was complimented on being his mistress. He even challenged Hugh Fortescue, fourteenth Baron Clinton, a rival for her favours, to a duel. Though he was to have many mistresses, he never married. The duke narrowly escaped matrimony in 1742 when George II chose Princess Louise of Denmark for his bride. Cumberland allegedly sought the advice of the former prime minister Sir Robert Walpole, now retired as earl of Orford. Orford got Cumberland off the hook by appealing to the king's avaricious nature, advising him to agree on condition that he received an ample establishment, assuring him that this would end the proposal. He followed this advice and the match was dropped.<br>
<br>In 1740 Cumberland received a commission from his father as colonel of the Coldstream regiment of foot guards. He had, however, indicated a preference for the navy, which had been nurtured by his tutor Sir Jacob Acworth, who had arranged for the young prince to witness launchings at naval dockyards. When he requested permission to go to sea as a volunteer the king consented. He therefore went to Portsmouth and boarded HMS <i>Victory</i>, the flagship of Admiral Sir John Norris. The ship was unfortunately rammed by another, the <i>Lion</i>, which was to play a less demeaning role in 1745 when it intercepted the ships taking Charles Edward Stuart to Scotland. Cumberland was obliged to transfer to another ship, and then, understandably, decided to abandon his naval career and return to London. When Frederick II of Prussia was told that the duke joined the navy &#145;to see some action&#146; he replied dismissively: &#145;What? does anyone expect to see action from an English fleet?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.163). While this was an insult to the naval feats Admiral Edward Vernon was performing at the time, it was not an unfitting comment on Cumberland's.<br>
<br>The duke wisely decided to resume his military career and in 1742 became a major-general. The following year he accompanied his father to the continent and saw action at the battle of Dettingen. It was a baptism of fire. Cumberland was shot below the knee by grapeshot and had to be carried off the field. The wound took months to heal and he never fully recovered his gait. It seems that the difficulties he experienced walking, so that he always preferred to be on horseback thereafter, led him to put on the weight which was to cause him to become obese and eventually hastened his death. Before he was wounded he had made himself conspicuous by his courage, &#145;riding about animating the men with great bravery and resolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Frankland-Russell-Astley MSS</span>, 253). It was generally agreed that he had conducted himself well in his first campaign. Afterwards while he was recuperating an observer noted his &#145;openness of temper and careless air, which is quite <i>&agrave; la militaire</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 3.39). He was now thoroughly attuned to a military life.<br>
<br>Cumberland did not see action in 1744, though he was put in charge of defending London at the time of a threatened invasion from France on behalf of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender. Instead of serving with the forces abroad he spent the summer in England, conducting an affair with Ann Montagu. Despite the continuing tensions between his brother and his father, Cumberland seems to have been able to get on well with both. Frederick commissioned a painting by Wootton of the duke on horseback, and they went to a cricket match together. At the start of the 1745 campaign the king made him commander-in-chief of the forces abroad, with the title captain-general, last held by John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough. Sir Everard Fawkener, a cosmopolitan figure who knew Voltaire, became his personal secretary, while Major Robert Napier dealt with his military correspondence.<br>
<br>Cumberland left England in April 1745 and proceeded via The Hague to Brussels. There he learned that the French commander, Marshal Saxe, was besieging Tournai. The allied commanders determined to relieve the siege by forcing a pitched battle 4 miles east of Tournai at Fontenoy. They thought that they had numerical superiority, with about 43,000 men under their command and estimated that Saxe had far fewer at his disposal. In fact they underestimated the numbers in the French army, which were about 47,000. Cumberland advanced on the right, with the Dutch under Waldeck on the left. At first the duke ordered Brigadier Ingoldsby to attack a redoubt, and when the order was not executed himself went forward to engage the enemy. His troops marched straight into withering fire which thinned their ranks remorselessly, and yet they still advanced under his command until he saw that further progress was hopeless, and ordered a retreat. The infantry then withdrew in perfect order, leaving 1500 of their comrades dead, and many more wounded, on the battlefield. Cumberland thus learned the hard way how devastating sustained firing from cannon and musket could be, and was to apply the lesson to the Jacobite army at the battle of Culloden. At the time he blamed the Dutch for the defeat of the allied army. In a letter he wrote to his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68369/', "Anne (1709&#150;1759)")</script>, the wife of the prince of Orange, he commended the behaviour of the Dutch infantry, &#145;but blames much that of their cavalry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 3.50). His own conduct was commended. &#145;He rallied the troops when broken and made a stand which saved the army from being entirely cut to pieces&#146;  (Richard Lyttelton to his father, quoted Whitworth, 50). After his victory Saxe swept all before him in the Netherlands, taking Tournai, Ghent, Oudenarde and, on 12 August, Ostend. It was in this dire situation, when Cumberland despaired of saving what was left of the Austrian Netherlands and feared for the security of the Dutch republic, that news reached him that the Pretender's son, Charles Edward Stuart, had landed in Scotland.<h2>
<a name="TheFortyfive"></a>The 'Forty-five</h2>When Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, raised his standard at Glenfinnan on 19 August 1745, before perhaps 1000 supporters, the duke of Cumberland had about 34,000 British troops under his command on the continent. There was an inevitable outcry that most if not all of these should be recalled immediately to Britain to deal with the rising. Cumberland, however, was initially reluctant to jeopardize the campaign by detaching forces from his already overstretched army to deal with rebels, and hoped that these would be dealt with by the available forces on the spot. In Scotland there were at most 3850 men under Sir John Cope, most of them in Edinburgh or Stirling, though some were scattered in barracks throughout the country. There were also about 6000 soldiers in England, again most of them in London but the rest scattered. The lords justices, who governed Britain in the absence of George II, who was in Hanover, ordered Cope to march towards the enemy and &#145;endeavour to attack and suppress them at once&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 4/136). They also called upon the 6000 men whom the Dutch had undertaken by treaty to supply in such emergencies. Fearing a French invasion they recalled the British garrison at Ostend to England. The duke was uneasy at this request and asked his father, who was on his way back to London, whether it was necessary. He himself was confident that Cope would &#145;put a stop immediately to this affair&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 4/201). Cope, however, did not do so. On the contrary his attempt to intercept and defeat the rebels in the highlands proved a disastrous failure. Far from forcing them to engage him in a battle which he set out convinced he could win, their strength and his weakness obliged him to avoid them by diverting his army to Inverness, leaving the way clear for Charles Edward to march down through Scotland to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>On hearing that Edinburgh was in the hands of the Young Pretender the cabinet immediately ordered Cumberland to send ten battalions under Sir John Ligonier back to England. The king, who when he was on the continent had shared his son's concern not to weaken his forces, now that he had returned to London agreed with his ministers. When he received his instructions Cumberland was downcast. &#145;I am heartily sorry for the occasion of this great detachment from our army&#146;, he wrote to the duke of Newcastle. &#145;I hope that Great Britain is not to be conquered by 3,000 rabble&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 36/68, fol. 153). In fact at the head of 2500 men Charles Edward routed a similar number under Cope at Prestonpans on 21 September. At least 300 royal troops were killed, and some 1500 were taken prisoner. The remainder, including Cope, fled south as fast as they could go.<br>
<br>Cope's defeat at Prestonpans jolted the English out of the complacency most of them had displayed towards the rising. There were cries now for all British troops on the continent to be recalled. The cabinet did not go so far, but ordered Cumberland to send six battalions of foot and nine squadrons of dragoons from Flanders, and to be ready to join them if necessary. He was eager to do so now, writing that &#145;it would be the last mortification to me when so much is at stake at home, and brought to the decision of arms, to be out of the way of doing my duty&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 6/30). George II gave his permission and Cumberland arrived in England on 19 October. Meanwhile the king had sent General George Wade north to command 10,000 men to intercept the Young Pretender when he left Scotland. By 3 November Wade had got as far as Morpeth, where he learned that the rebels had left Edinburgh and were heading south. He therefore fell back on Newcastle, expecting to engage them there. Instead by a feint they made their way to Carlisle. Wade marched along the Tyne valley to intercept them but got bogged down in a snowstorm at Hexham. The Young Pretender had given him the slip and was heading towards the heart of England.<br>
<br>Sir John Ligonier was ordered to advance troops under his command in the south to the River Mersey. He got as far as Lichfield when he fell ill and was unable to continue. The king replaced him on 21 November by putting Cumberland in command of the army. This appointment immediately boosted the morale of the soldiers who &#145;leaped and skipped about like wild things that the Duke was to command them&#146;  (F. Eld to J. Eld, 23 Nov 1745, Staffs. RO, D/798/3/1/1). When Cumberland arrived at Lichfield on 27 November the rebels were already at Preston. He took stock of the situation facing him in his new command. His infantry was in a line from Tamworth to Stafford, while the cavalry was between Lichfield and Newcastle under Lyme. As there were still some forces <i>en route</i> to join him he decided to stay put until they arrived, and asked Wade to send his cavalry forward to harass the enemy. Seeing that Wade had moved only 40 miles south of Newcastle, the duke was being unduly optimistic in thinking that they could trap the rebels in a pincer movement between their two armies. By the time Wade reached Ripon on 30 November the Young Pretender was at Manchester. The following day the rebels arrived in Macclesfield. They kept Cumberland guessing whether they were heading towards Derby or Wales. Persuaded by Lord George Murray's moving to Congleton that they were probably trying to link up with Welsh Jacobites he advanced his army to Stone, where he expected to confront them. Instead Charles Edward marched to Derby, arriving there on 4 December.<br>
<br>Cumberland realized early on 3 December that he had been misled, and would have made immediately for Derby, but his troops were not in a condition for the forced march that would be required to reach it in time. He therefore decided to move them to Northampton where he was convinced he could intercept the bulk of the Jacobite forces, though he did warn Newcastle to guard the approaches to London at Finchley just in case some of them got ahead of him. In the event the march to Finchley, which Hogarth depicted, was an unnecessary precaution, for on 6 December the Jacobites made the fateful decision to return to Scotland. It was a wise decision in view of the military situation. They had at most 5000 men in their ranks. Against this Cumberland had at least 9000 men in his army. There were over 4000 regular troops at or near Finchley, while Wade led over 6000 cavalry and infantry at Wetherby. For the rebels to have gone on further towards London would have been suicidal. If they could get back to Scotland, however, there was still some hope of keeping the rebellion alive.<br>
<br>As soon as he knew that they were retreating Cumberland sent an express to Wade to march across into Lancashire in order to block their retreat, stressing that if he could not get there before them &#145;these villains may escape back unpunished to our eternal shame&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 7/325). Wade, however, was as slow-moving as ever and by 10 December had got only as far as Wakefield, where he learned that the Jacobite army had reached Manchester the day before, so he called off the pursuit and went back to Newcastle. Meanwhile Cumberland was in hot pursuit with all his cavalry and 1000 volunteers from his infantry who rode on horses provided by local people. By 9 December they were at Lichfield, having covered 30 miles that day. Even so, the rebels were retreating so fast that the duke despaired of catching up with them, though he was determined &#145;to pursue with this flying corps till I shall lose every glimpse of hopes of a possibility of overtaking them&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 7/369).<br>
<br>By 11 December he had reached Macclesfield. Stragglers from the Jacobite army who were picked up he sent to gaol, explaining to the duke of Newcastle that &#145;they have so many of our prisoners in their hands I did not care to put them to death. But&#146;, he added, &#145;I have encouraged the country people to do it as they may fall in their way&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 8/6). These grim words show how &#145;the martial boy&#146;, as he was called at the outset of the campaign, was hardening into &#145;the Butcher&#146;. He continued the pursuit to within a few miles of Lancaster and was hoping to overtake his enemy when orders reached him on 15 December from the king to return immediately to London. The government had learned that a French invasion was imminent and wanted the duke's forces ready to resist it. Cumberland was mortified, informing Newcastle that &#145;it was the greatest disappointment that ever befel me&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 8/50). Next day, however, he received an express that the orders had been countermanded to allow him to renew the pursuit. An eyewitness reported that on receiving it he &#145;jumped around the room for joy and declared that he would follow them to the furthest part of Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fitzherbert MSS</span>, 176).<br>
<br>Although he felt that the delay had ruined any chance of overtaking the rebels, he did catch up with their rearguard on 18 December at Clifton just south of Penrith. There was fought the last engagement between two armies on English soil. Some cavalrymen were dismounted to fight about 1000 rebels who had lined the hedges leading to the village in order to cover their army's retreat. Both sides claimed victory, and each with justice. The Jacobites had held off the pursuit of their main force. On the other hand Cumberland had flushed them out of Clifton, which he described as &#145;one of the strongest posts I ever saw&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 8/110). He reached Carlisle on 21 December, where the rebels had left a garrison of about 400 men. It took him ten days to reduce them to surrender. When they capitulated on 30 December Cumberland wrote: &#145;now we may have the happiness to say that this part of the kingdom is clear of all the rebels&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 8/161).<br>
<br>After the capture of Carlisle Cumberland returned to London to be on hand in case a French invasion was launched in favour of the Jacobites. Meanwhile the rebel army reached Falkirk and proceeded to engage the forces there under General Henry Hawley. To the astonishment and dismay of the British government they more than held their own. It was clear that Hawley was completely discredited by the outcome of the battle fought on 17 January 1746 and had to be replaced. The king chose his son and sent him to Edinburgh, where he arrived on 30 January. There he held court in Holyrood, to emphasize the re-establishment of the rule of George II in the very place where the Young Pretender had stayed just three months earlier. After addressing the civic dignitaries he addressed the army he had come to lead, assuring them that they would find it easy &#145;to crush the insolence of a set of thieves and plunderers who have learned from their fathers to disturb every government they have lived under&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Address to the Army</span>). He left for Stirling the next day, taking with him enough troops &#145;to drive them off the face of the earth, if they will do their duty, which we must expect&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 8/28). On his way he learned that the rebels had abandoned the siege of Stirling and were heading for Inverness, which they took from the earl of Loudoun on 17 February.<br>
<br>Cumberland's initial reaction to their retreat northwards was to assume that the rebellion was over and that he had little more than a mopping-up operation to conduct, albeit one which involved the summary execution of rebels and the devastation of their estates. When he communicated to Newcastle his view that the rebels were no longer a threat, the duke was able to use it to engineer the Pelhamite coup in the cabinet in which they finally ousted the king's favourite, John Carteret, second Earl Granville, from his counsels and established their own supremacy in the ministry. Cumberland, though he identified himself with the Pelhams and &#145;the Old Whig cause&#146;, was concerned that this ministerial instability would play into the hands of the Jacobites  (BL, Add. MS 32706, fol. 157). He was therefore relieved when the situation stabilized, and expressed the wish to Newcastle that there would be &#145;no more of these dangerous shakes of Government&#146;  (ibid., fol. 233). He publicly demonstrated his endorsement of the outcome at his dinner table on 17 February, according to his aide-de-camp Joseph Yorke, when &#145;he made us all drink a bumper to our old friends and no more changes&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32706, fol. 191).<br>
<br>The fall of Inverness to Charles Edward's troops, however, changed the situation overnight. Cumberland again had a war on his hands. He therefore established his headquarters at Aberdeen where he remained from his arrival on 27 February until 8 April. He had to wait that long until severe winter weather abated and the crossing of the River Spey by his army became possible. While there he drafted a proclamation threatening the rebels with &#145;military execution&#146; if they did not surrender to him. This phrase was disliked by the lord justice clerk, Andrew Fletcher, who preferred &#145;the utmost rigour of the law&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 12/75). Cumberland wrote for clarification to the duke of Newcastle, asking advice from the king on that matter. Newcastle's reply was a masterpiece of passing the buck. Cumberland could do &#145;whatever is necessary for suppressing this unnatural rebellion&#146; but should not &#145;give any just cause of complaint to a country so ill disposed to the king&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32706, fol. 325). Cumberland took this to give him carte blanche to continue his scorched earth policy. &#145;Don't imagine that threatening military execution and many other things are pleasing to me&#146;, he replied to Newcastle. &#145;But nothing will go down without in this part of the world&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32707, fol. 13). During the weeks in Aberdeen Cumberland's forces were trained to adapt to the fighting techniques of the Jacobite army. The troops led by Cope at Prestonpans and Hawley at Falkirk had been demoralized by the rebel infantry's use of shields and broadswords to hack their way through riflemen. Cumberland's infantrymen practised pointing their bayonets to the right rather than straight ahead, in order to stab the unshielded side of their opponent.<br>
<br>On 8 April the duke's army at last marched out of Aberdeen and proceeded by way of Old Meldrum and Banff to Cullen, where they were joined by the forces of William Anne Keppel, second earl of Albemarle, from Strathbogie. They then proceeded to cross the Spey, meeting little resistance from the enemy. By 14 April they were at Nairn, where Cumberland received intelligence that Charles Edward's army at Inverness was preparing to fight a battle with his. On 15 April the Jacobites attempted to surprise the duke's men in a night attack on their camp at Balblair. The 15th was actually Cumberland's twenty-fifth birthday, and they expected that his soldiers would celebrate it until their guard was seriously relaxed. They took so long in crossing the moor from Culloden House, where they were encamped, however, that dawn broke before they could make their attack, removing the element of surprise. They retreated tired and dejected to await Cumberland's march to Drummossie Moor. Even if they had succeeded in their attempt they would have found that their opponents were not sleeping off a drunken birthday party in their tents, but were preparing to march to meet them. Between 4 and 5 o'clock on 16 April the whole army was mobilized and on the march to Culloden. When they got there they saw the enemy, about 5000 in all, lined up to meet them, and formed ranks about 500 yards from them. Cumberland addressed his 9000 troops, urging them to stand their ground and to &#145;parry the enemy in the manner you have been directed&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 16, 1746, 271). He then sent forward his aide-de-camp, George Keppel, Viscount Bury, to discover the intentions of the enemy. As Bury advanced a cannon ball whistled over his head. The battle of Culloden had begun.<br>
<br>Cumberland's artillery replied to the rebels, who withstood a murderous fire for between fifteen and thirty minutes before charging. When they charged they ran into grapeshot which &#145;made open lanes quite through them, the men dropping down by wholesale&#146;  (M. Hughes, <span class="italic">A Plain Narrative or Journal of the Late Rebellion</span>, 1746, 41). The rebels charged Cumberland's right wing, where he himself was positioned, three times, running up to within 100 yards of his front line before retreating. The two armies came to closer grips on the duke's left, even though the Jacobites were raked by gunfire from their flank as well as from the front. The two front lines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, where the bayonet proved superior to the broadsword, so that losses in the Jacobite ranks far outweighed those among the Hanoverian troops. The rebels retreated, to be pursued by the dragoons who inflicted a dreadful slaughter not only on the field of battle but all the way down from the moor to Inverness. Possibly as many as 2000 men were hacked to death as they fled from Culloden. Drummossie Moor was turned into a killing field that day. In all the Jacobites sustained some 3600 casualties. Since their wounded were left untended, dying of their wounds, or were dispatched by their victors, these were nearly all fatalities. The barbarity of the Hanoverians was inspired by stories of the inhumanity of their enemies when the boot was on the other foot, particularly at Prestonpans, where the carnage was attributed to their refusal to offer quarter to the wounded.<br>
<br>The day after the battle, however, Cumberland issued &#145;orders of the day&#146; which gave a new excuse for savagery. The men who were sent out to track down Jacobites were told to &#145;take notice that the public orders of the rebels yesterday was to give us no quarters&#146;  (NA Scot., GD1/322/1). This claim has been denied by historians sympathetic to Jacobitism, some even accusing the duke of having forged orders allegedly issued by Lord George Murray &#145;to give no quarters to the Elector's troops on any account whatsoever&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 13/405). Certainly no genuine orders of Murray's issued before the battle contain this phrase. However, the night attack which occurred prior to it could have succeeded only if no quarter was given to the duke's men. The attackers were heavily outnumbered and the only chance of success was to murder their enemies in their tents. Moreover Cumberland could not have got away with a complete fabrication without the connivance of the whole high command of his army. There is no need to posit a conspiracy for a policy on which the victors were virtually all agreed anyway. They were utterly convinced that the rebels must be extirpated to prevent another rebellion breaking out. Cumberland had already gone beyond the strict limits of the law in pursuit of what he saw as his duty. He believed in &#145;military execution&#146; and thought that lenity after the 1715 rebellion had kept treason alive. The ministers in Whitehall had tipped him the wink that no questions would be asked about the means he employed to achieve this goal. Indeed few people were moved to inquire closely into the slaughter of enemies who were widely regarded as being subhuman. On the contrary reaction to the news of the duke's victory was to praise him to the skies as the conquering hero. Addresses flowed in from all parts of the realm and the empire congratulating him on his feat. There were, however, some who did question his humanity. A newspaper printed before the end of May a report that when he returned to London he was to be made a freeman of the Butchers' Company. On 1 August Horace Walpole retailed a more celebrated version of the story in a letter, claiming that when &#145;it was lately proposed in the City to present him with the freedom of some company, one of the aldermen said aloud, &#147;Then let it be of the Butchers&#148;!&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.288). Within weeks of the action at Culloden, Cumberland had been dubbed with the title by which he was for ever to be known, &#145;the Butcher&#146;.<br>
<br>Cumberland remained in Scotland until July &#145;to pursue and hunt out these vermin amongst their lurking holes&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 14/234). Among the &#145;vermin&#146; was the Young Pretender, who had fled from the battlefield. He was successful in eluding the duke's search parties and eventually returned to the continent. His more humble supporters were less fortunate, as Cumberland visited a reign of terror upon them. Rebels still in arms were summarily shot. Their houses and effects were destroyed. Nor did some of the officers employed in this business distinguish too nicely between men who had been &#145;out&#146; and other Scots suspected of disaffection. Towards the end of May Cumberland moved from Inverness to Fort Augustus and then to Fort William, to show the highlanders &#145;that it is as much in his Majesty's power to march his forces into that country which they have hitherto boasted as inaccessible as into any other part of his dominions&#146;  (Cumberland papers, 18/396). Having shown the flag in the highlands, and visited misery on the inhabitants, the duke left Scotland at the end of July, arriving in London on the 25th. He received a hero's welcome. Parliament had already voted thanks for the victory at Culloden and passed an act granting him and his heir &pound;25,000 a year over and above his civil list grant. Now a thanksgiving service was held in St Paul's Cathedral at which was played the first performance of Handel's &#145;The Conquering Hero&#146;, composed specially for his Highness.<h2>
<a name="Theconqueringheroinwarandpeace"></a>The conquering hero in war and peace</h2>Cumberland was content to rest on his laurels for the continental campaign of 1746. The defeat of forces under Sir John Ligonier at Roucoux near Li&egrave;ge in October, however, made him decide to return to active service. He went to The Hague to co-ordinate forces for the next campaign in 1747, and after briefly returning to London in January was back on the continent in February. His first aim was to recover Antwerp, but he found the Dutch too preoccupied with an internal upheaval which restored the stadholderate to co-operate in the enterprise. The new stadholder was his brother-in-law, William IV, prince of Orange. Cumberland then undertook to defend Maastricht from Marshal Saxe, confronting him at the battle of Laffeldt on 2 July <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. His army of 90,000 was outnumbered by Saxe's army of 125,000. After five hours of fierce fighting he was forced to admit defeat and ordered his men to retreat. During the engagement Ligonier was taken prisoner and Cumberland himself narrowly averted the same fate. His defeat was no disgrace. George Townshend observed that &#145;the action was long and severe; many respectable officers were brought out severely wounded, to the great concern of H. R. H. who stood the whole action under a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery until the troops were obliged to abandon it&#146;  (Townshend MSS, National Army Museum Library, quoted Whitworth, 120). After the battle the French besieged Bergen-op-Zoom. The prince of Orange wanted the allies to go to its relief but Cumberland preferred to defend Maastricht. This caused tension between the brothers-in-law, which was not reduced when Bergen-op-Zoom fell in September, the last action of the campaign.<br>
<br>The following April Saxe besieged Maastricht. Cumberland was unable to raise the siege, though the signing of peace preliminaries at the end of the month brought hostilities to an end. The duke visited Hanover that summer, and returned to England in September before rejoining the army in the Netherlands until peace was finally signed at Aix-la-Chapelle in October.<br>
<br>When he returned to England Cumberland spent most of his time in Windsor Forest, of which he had been made ranger in 1746. He lived mainly at the Ranger's Lodge, now known by his name. As ranger he employed hundreds of demobilized soldiers to construct the lake which became known as Virginia Water, and to plant trees, many of which still survive. If this was to show sympathy to former comrades-in-arms he showed none towards the common people. On the contrary, he exploited the rangership just as ruthlessly as the whigs who had suppressed unwelcome hunters in the royal forests during the 1720s. Cumberland attempted to revive the swanimote courts which they had used to enforce the forest laws far more rigorously than had their predecessors. He even prevented people from entering the Great Park to collect firewood, though this was an immemorial custom, on the grounds that it disturbed the game. Horace Walpole, in an attack on the duke made in <span class="italic">The Remembrancer</span> for 14 October 1749, claimed that as ranger &#145;he disobliged the whole country&#146;. Walpole also objected to his &#145;very tyrannic behaviour to the army&#146;, while Earl Waldegrave remarked that &#145;even the Army had been taught to complain of the unnecessary strictness of his discipline; that they were treated rather like Germans than English Men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 155). These remarks were inspired by Cumberland's sponsoring of changes in the <span class="roman">Army Act</span> in 1749 making it more draconian. Thus refusal to obey orders was made a capital offence.<h2>
<a name="Politicianandprince17491754"></a>Politician and prince, 1749&#150;1754</h2>Cumberland's contributions to debates in the Upper House in 1749, of which he had been a member since 1742, announced his intervention in British politics. He attached himself to the connection of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, secretary of state, and John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, first lord of the Admiralty, in opposition to the duke of Newcastle's old corps on the one hand and his brother Frederick's reversionary interest on the other. This left him exposed to attacks from both. One of the first things which Frederick proposed to do when he became king was to dismiss his brother from all his commands. A direct onslaught on the duke from the prince of Wales's camp was launched early in 1751 by John Perceval, second earl of Egmont, in an anonymous broadside entitled <span class="italic">Constitutional Queries</span>. This asserted that Cumberland's appetite for military rule had been whetted by his experiences in Scotland, where, it was claimed, the army had usurped a dominion over law. The very first query asked: &#145;Whether this capital may not be beset with troops, under such orders and commands, as may render the power of King, Lords and Commons precarious, and subject our liberties, property and laws once more to a military regulation.&#146; The phrase &#145;once more&#146; linked Cumberland to Cromwell in the collective memory. It was little more than the usual opposition suspicion of a standing army in peacetime which went back to the seventeenth century, and echoed charges which had been made about the duke of Marlborough at the end of the previous war. But Frederick as the elder brother made rather more of it. Another query asked:<blockquote>Whether, if a <i>younger</i> son of the Crown should ever be invested with absolute power over such an army; and at the same time by a factious connection, make himself master of the fleet, our lives and fortunes might not be dependent on his will and pleasure; and the <i>right of succession</i> have no other security, than his want of ambition.</blockquote>On 22 January 1751 both houses of parliament ordered the broadside to be burnt by the hangman in Palace Yard, while the king issued a proclamation offering a reward of &pound;500 for the discovery of the author.<br>
<br>The rivalry between the two brothers was cut short by the sudden death of Frederick in March. On hearing of it Cumberland was alleged to have said, &#145;It is a great blow to this country, but I hope it will recover it in time.&#146; The crowds in the streets of London were heard to lament, &#145;Oh that it was but his brother!&#146; and in the City, &#145;Oh that it was but the Butcher!&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.55). Frederick's death left his twelve-year-old son, the future George III, as heir to the throne. Since the king was sixty-seven it seemed inevitable that there would have to be a regency when he died. The question of who was to be regent, Cumberland or Frederick's widow Augusta, was to embroil the duke even more firmly in the politics of the reign. Frederick's friends wanted his widow to be sole regent. According to their leader, Egmont:<blockquote>the Duke of Cumberland and his party were labouring all they could <i>either to prevent any thoughts of such an appointment at all&#151;or to leave it to the King to do as he pleased by Will&#151;or to have a Regency of the great officers of State, and some other persons among which was the</i> <i>Duke of Cumberland</i>&#151;who being Commander of the Army, with his creatures would overbalance the council of the rest, and in case of a demise would immediately have the whole power. (Newman, 200)</blockquote>The king was in favour of his son being regent. The Pelhams, however, were insistent that Cumberland's unpopularity made it dangerous to make him regent, and urged that the princess should have the title, with a council of regency to advise her. The elder Pitt expressed the view in parliament that to make Cumberland sole regent was dangerous not because of his reputation but because of his ambition to wear the crown! The duke's supporters, who included Henry Fox in the Commons as well as the Bedford connection in the Lords, wanted him to have a chief part in the regency, though they accepted that there would have to be a place for Princess Augusta. Unfortunately she was as estranged from Cumberland as her husband had been, and did not wish him to be on the council of regency. Although the act of parliament which set up the arrangements for a regency did give him the first seat on the council, he was mortally offended. He was even more outraged shortly afterwards when he was visited by Prince George to whom he showed a sword. According to Horace Walpole, &#145;the young Prince turned pale, and trembled, and thought his uncle was going to murder him. The Duke was extremely shocked, and complained to the Princess of the impressions that had been instilled into the child against him&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.72). As Earl Waldegrave commented: &#145;that he had ever the most distant Design of a more criminal Nature, that he meant anything hurtful to his Nephew, or dangerous to the Public, the Insinuation was base and villainous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 156).<br>
<br>In June 1751 the duke of Bedford resigned as secretary of state; explaining his resignation to George II he said that he and Sandwich were opposed by the Pelhams &#145;solely from their attachment to his son the Duke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 128). Once again Henry Pelham and his brother the duke of Newcastle had outmanoeuvred their ministerial opponents. Cumberland decided &#145;not to give the Pelhams so fair an opportunity of mischief as by setting up the standard of opposition during his father's life&#146;  (ibid., 165). He did, however, oppose the ministers behind the scenes, for instance furnishing the duke of Bedford with information to use with deadly effect in a debate in the House of Lords on 17 March 1752 on a bill designed to create a colony of foreign protestants on forfeited Jacobite estates in Scotland. He was also so close to Henry Fox that when the latter opposed Lord Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Bill</span> in 1753, Hardwicke alluded to their association in a speech accusing Fox of favouring force over law, which the duke took as an allusion to himself.<h2>
<a name="Returntowar17541760"></a>Return to war, 1754&#150;1760</h2>In 1754, when news reached England that Colonel George Washington had been defeated by the French in a skirmish near Fort Duquesne, Cumberland's advice was sought in the cabinet as to how to react. He advised sending regular troops which, despite his father's fears that this might provoke war with France in Europe, was agreed. General Braddock was sent to avenge the defeat. Unfortunately his army was routed the following July and he himself was killed. This was the greatest blow to the prestige of British arms in North America before the American War of Independence. At the time that Braddock's defeat was known in England, George II was in Hanover, and Cumberland was one of the lords justices governing the kingdom in the king's absence. He was made to feel personally responsible for the fiasco, especially when the French published his orders to Braddock, claiming that they revealed Britain's hostile intentions towards them. His own reaction was to advise declaring war on France immediately, but open hostilities in Europe were delayed until the French took Minorca in 1756. Its capture led the duke to exclaim: &#145;We are undone! Sea and land are cowards! I am ashamed of my profession!&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.158). Admiral Byng was held responsible for the loss of Minorca, was tried by a court martial, and sentenced to death. The sentence divided the country between those who felt it was deserved and those who considered it to be too severe. Cumberland was included in the former camp by Horace Walpole and in the latter by Richard Rigby, an MP in the Bedford connection. If Rigby was right, then it was a rare example of the duke's clemency.<br>
<br>Rigby was probably better informed than Walpole, for at that time the struggle for power between Henry Fox and William Pitt was polarizing the rival interests of Cumberland, which included the Bedford connection, and the dowager princess of Wales. Fox became paymaster-general of the forces through the duke's influence in the spring of 1757, just before he left England to take up his command. Over the summer, however, Pitt did a deal with the duke of Newcastle and formed a ministry which did not favour Cumberland's continental strategy.<br>
<br>The opening stages of the Seven Years' War were disastrous in both America and Europe. Cumberland sent John Campbell, fourth earl of Loudoun, to North America, but he failed to take Cape Breton while the French commander, Montcalm, took Fort William Henry. In Europe the French, allied with Austria, Russia, and Sweden, advanced against their enemy the king of Prussia. In April 1757 Cumberland was dispatched to the continent to aid the Prussians. Frederick the Great wanted him to advance from Bielefeld, where some 45,000 men under his command were encamped, towards Wesel. But that would expose the electorate of Hanover to the risk of a French invasion, and the move was disallowed by the Hanoverian ministers. Instead the duke found himself attacked by the French at Hastenbeck. Though he put up a valiant fight in the battle fought there on 24 July he was defeated, and Hanover was exposed to French occupation. To save his electorate the king sent his son plenipotentiary powers to treat with the French, on the basis that Hanover would remain neutral and offer no more assistance to Prussia. When George discovered that the idea of a separate peace was not likely to be accepted by his enemies, while his ally Frederick felt betrayed, under pressure from his ministers he tried to countermand his instructions, and on 16 September ordered Cumberland to assist the Prussians after all. Unfortunately the change of advice arrived too late, for the duke had signed a convention with the French at Kloster-Zeven on 8 September. Since this was virtually a capitulation George II repudiated it and dismissed Cumberland, who returned home in disgrace. His reception in London on 11 October was very different from that which he had received as the victor of Culloden twelve years earlier, when honours and rewards had been showered on him. Now the king told him &#145;that he had ruined his country and his army, and had hurt, or lost, his own reputation&#146;. Cumberland forthwith resigned all his military commissions. He never commanded again. There was a rumour at the time of an invasion scare in 1759 that he would be asked to resume command, but he ridiculed it, saying that he did not believe &#145;that the command will be offered to me, but when no wise man would accept it, and no honest man would refuse it&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 82). On 21 August 1760 he suffered a stroke. Although he recovered his powers of speech this would have incapacitated him from any military activity even if he had still been in command.<h2>
<a name="UncletoGeorgeIII17601765"></a>Uncle to George III, 1760&#150;1765</h2>Shortly afterwards George II died. Cumberland was the chief mourner at the funeral. His father's will left him &pound;180,000 which he gave to his sisters. His nephew now came to the throne. Although there had been friction between the two when George III was prince, as king he was reconciled with his uncle, who stood in as father of the bride when he married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on 8 September 1761. Indeed the duke's advice was once again sought on military matters. Thus the decision to send the earl of Albemarle (formerly his aide-de-camp at Culloden, Bury) to the West Indies in 1762 was very much his, and when the expedition took Cuba he was overjoyed.<br>
<br>Politically, however, Cumberland was on bad terms with the earl of Bute, and when his former friends Bedford, Fox, and Sandwich threw in their lot with the favourite the duke fell back on the old corps whigs whom they had replaced. &#145;Whenever the vermin the court is now full of be swept away&#146;, he wrote to the duke of Devonshire, &#145;we may see you there again at the head of our real friends&#146;  (Whitworth, 28). Although he frowned on a formed opposition Cumberland was not averse to voting against the ministry, for instance over the issue of parliamentary privilege raised by the Wilkes case. His coolness towards the Grenville ministry paid dividends when George III also cooled towards it and sought the duke's advice on the formation of a new administration. He advised George to make Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, his chief minister. Although the government which replaced Grenville became known as the Rockingham administration it could justifiably have been called the Cumberland ministry. Cabinet meetings were held at Cumberland Lodge and at his house in Upper Grosvenor Street. It was while attending a meeting in his London residence on 31 October 1765 that he collapsed and died. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 9 November.<br>
<br>Cumberland's death at the age of forty-four left a strange legacy. On the one hand he was vilified as the Butcher, and there is a legend that he was also known as Stinking Billy in Scotland, in retaliation against those of his admirers in England who adopted the flower Sweet William as his emblem. Yet when the Sons of Liberty in South Carolina drank forty-five healths in honour of John Wilkes, one of the toasts was &#145;to the duke of Cumberland&#146;. To those who raised their glasses he was a &#145;friend of America&#146;, having presided over the appointment of Lord Rockingham's ministry, which had repealed the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. Whether he would have remained friendly to the colonists had he lived, or would have advocated their suppression as rebels, though hypothetical, is a question worth pondering. As &#145;the martial boy&#146; he would undoubtedly have urged &#145;military execution&#146;. But Cumberland had come a long way since then, and was acquiring a political maturity working with the old corps which could well have led him to advocate conciliatory measures.<br>
