<span class="headword">Thomson,  James</span>  (1779&#150;1850), <span class="occ">calico printer</span>, was born on 6 February 1779 at Blackburn, Lancashire, the second of the five children of John Thomson, an iron-liquor merchant (iron-liquor, acetate of iron, was a mordant for the calico dyeing industry), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1824). Thomson wrote of his &#145;closeness&#146; to the Peel family, and it has been suggested that his mother was a sister of the first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21763/', "Sir Robert Peel")</script>.<br>
<br>Thomson, whose skill as an industrial chemist and whose success in improving the quality of design led to his being called the &#145;Duke of Wellington of calico printing&#146;  (Turnbull, 80), grew up in Lancashire before beginning in 1793 a year's study at Glasgow University. There he began lifelong friendships with Gregory Watt, the son of James Watt, and the poet Thomas Campbell. At the age of sixteen he began work for Joseph Peel &amp; Co., the London house of the extensive calico printing business. He remained there for six years, furthering his education by private study and through friendships with Sir Humphrey Davey and other scientists. Thomson's knowledge of chemistry impressed his employers, who sent him to manage their works at Church, near Accrington, where he remained until 1810. In that year he and John Chippendale, a Blackburn cotton merchant, became calico printers at Clitheroe, briefly at Up Brooks, and in 1811 at Primrose, where they established an industrial colony renowned both for the superiority of its products and for its paternalism.<br>
<br>Thomson travelled widely on the continent between 1814 and 1817, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1821. Though he combined &#145;in an eminent degree scientific with practical knowledge&#146;  (Baines, 277), he combed Europe for outstanding chemists and artists. And as a means of enhancing standards in the trade, he supported schools of design and successfully campaigned for the act of 1842, which extended the copyright on dress patterns to nine months and on those for furnishings to three years. It was said of him, however, that &#145;His love of art, taste and progress carried him in many cases beyond the taste of his consumers, and he often reaped the reward of genius in advance of the age&#151;disappointment&#146;  (Potter, 17&#150;18).<br>
<br>Primrose, &#145;a large village, in which square and lofty mills &hellip; stand in lieu of cottages and ordinary dwellings&#146;, employed &#145;twelve hundred people in &hellip; stamping millions of yards of cotton&#146; with indelible colours and designs  (Granville, 363). During the 1840s the firm registered on average more than 500 dress designs each year, and &#145;there was no house did better work than Primrose in its halcyon days&#146;  (Hargreaves, 80).<br>
<br>Thomson married, on 18 March 1806, Cecilia, the eldest daughter of the Revd Thomas Starkie, vicar of Blackburn. They had four sons and two daughters. Thomson, a Liberal in politics, was the second mayor of Clitheroe, in 1836&#150;7, and he became a JP in 1840. As well as a number of trenchantly argued pamphlets on the copyright question, he wrote the article on &#145;Manufacture of cotton&#146; in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (1812).<br>
<br>One of Thomson's favourite sayings was that men who became calico printers had only two choices&#151;&#145;the Gazette or the grave&#146;&#151;something he himself bore out. On 17 September 1850, he was at home preparing for the Great Exhibition of the following year when he died from an attack of paralysis, aged seventy-one. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Clitheroe, on 23 September.<br>
