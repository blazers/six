<span class="headword">Walker,  James</span>  (1758<span class="mult">x</span>60&#150;1822<span class="mult">x</span>5?), <span class="occ">engraver in mezzotint and stipple</span>, son (according to Redgrave) of a captain in the merchant service, was apprenticed to the London engraver Valentine Green on 28 January 1773. He left Green in 1780, the year of his earliest published plate, dated 2 July, which depicted Sir Hyde Parker, after Romney; this was followed by other portraits, notably after Romney, as well as the subject pieces for which Green's studio was renowned. He engraved a portrait of Empress Catherine II from a painting belonging to the Russian ambassador, Ivan Simolin, and it was probably Simolin who recruited him to go to Russia in 1784, where he was appointed engraver to Catherine. Walker was accompanied by his wife, Mary, and possibly a daughter. Two more children were born while they were in Russia: Catherine (born and died in 1791) and a son, Charles James (1786&#150;1788). Walker was also accompanied by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/848/', "John Augustus Atkinson (1774x6&#150;1830)")</script>, probably his stepson, who later trained under Walker and developed into a competent painter in Russia.<br>
<br>Walker's principal task was to engrave important pictures by old and contemporary masters in the imperial collection, but he also produced some forty-three portraits of the imperial family and the Russian aristocracy. On 30 December 1786 he was made an associate of the Academy of Arts at St Petersburg, and in September 1794 a full academician. His appointment as imperial engraver was renewed by Emperor Alexander I. Walker returned to England from time to time to arrange publication of his engravings. During one such visit, in 1792, when he also took out the freedom of the Russia Company, he published two parts of <span class="italic">A collection of prints, from the most celebrated pictures in the gallery of her imperial majesty Catherine II, empress and autocratix of all the Russias</span>. These were retailed for him by the landscape painter William Hodges and the bookseller R. Blamire. Back in Russia, Walker's other duties included showing distinguished British and other foreign visitors round the Hermitage, and the training of pupils. He returned to England with a pension in 1802, but twenty-four of his plates were lost in a shipwreck off Yarmouth.<br>
<br>In London, Walker continued to publish mezzotints and also to collaborate with Atkinson. He engraved several of Atkinson's pictures but he also wrote the text for <span class="italic">A Picturesque Representation of the Manners, Customs and Amusements of the Russians</span> (1803&#150;4), in three volumes, illustrated with 100 aquatints by Atkinson, and dedicated to Alexander I. In 1807 they launched a similar collaboration on <span class="italic">A picturesque representation of the naval, military and miscellaneous costumes of Great Britain</span>, although only the first volume appeared. Walker wrote a light-hearted account of his experiences in <span class="italic">Paramythia, or, Mental pastimes: being original anecdotes, historical, descriptive, humourous, and witty, collected chiefly during a long residence at the court of Russia, by the author</span>; probably written by 1816, it was published anonymously in 1821. A sale of his surviving prints took place on 29 November 1822; Walker may have died shortly before that date, although the existence in the British Museum of a plate by him published in 1825 suggests, if it was not a reprint, that he died a few years later.<br>
