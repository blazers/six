<span class="headword">Sprigg,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> in or after 1701), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, was baptized on 9 July 1633 at Banbury, Oxfordshire, the youngest surviving son of William Sprigg or Sprigge (<i>fl</i>. 1618&#150;1652), steward of New College, Oxford, and subsequently assessment commissioner for Oxfordshire, and his wife, Rebecca. Sprigg's elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26177/', "Joshua Sprigg")</script> was an Independent minister, and their father procured the rectory of Somerton, Oxfordshire, for their brother-in-law John Fenwick. After matriculating at Lincoln College, Oxford, on 2 October 1652, Sprigg graduated BA ten days later. On the recommendation of Oliver Cromwell (chancellor of the university), Sprigg became a fellow of Lincoln on 11 December 1652. At Oxford he was part of the experimental philosophy circle that included John Locke, Robert Boyle, William Petty, and Christopher Wren. He proceeded MA on 15 June 1655. His first publication, <span class="italic">Philosophicall Essayes with Brief Adviso's</span>, appeared anonymously in 1657, with discourses criticizing logicians and Galenist physicians, praising natural science, and exploring themes as diverse as melancholy, atheism, the ministry, and antiquity. The same year he was appointed a fellow of the new college at Durham, a position he held until its dissolution in 1659. On 27 November 1657 he was also admitted to Gray's Inn, and in 1659 he was incorporated MA at Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Sprigg's major work, <span class="italic">A Modest Plea for an Equal Common-Wealth Against Monarchy</span>, was published anonymously in September 1659 and reveals his indebtedness to Francis Bacon and especially James Harrington. In the commonwealth he espoused, offices would be filled by rotation among qualified men, with the highest officers being godly gentry. Castigating hereditary nobles, professional clergy, and lawyers as enemies of a free state, he favoured freedom of conscience as long as people kept within legal bounds, moderation, and morality. He called for the abolition of professional clergy and tithes, and for the expropriation of glebe lands for annexation to workhouses. Sprigg urged legal reform, with simpler laws, land registers, and courts in all counties, and a single, free tenure for all land, with compensation to landlords for relinquishing copyhold. Primogeniture should be replaced by gavelkind or multiple inheritance, but he would permit an eldest son to receive a double portion or the entire personal estate. Sprigg supported the decentralization of higher education, with staff rather than superfluous heads governing schools. Instead of classical and scholastic studies, the curriculum in at least some schools should stress such utilitarian subjects as riding, fencing, dancing, music, modern languages, history, politics, civil and common law, chemistry, anatomy, medicine, agriculture, and animal husbandry. In their spare time, students were to study vocational topics. According to Sprigg's friend Anthony Wood, copies of <span class="italic">A Modest Plea</span> were &#145;greedily bought up, and taken into the hands of all curious men&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.560). It prompted an anonymous response, <span class="italic">A Modest Reply, in Answer to the Modest Plea</span> (1659). Sprigg's last work, <span class="italic">The Royal and Happy Poverty</span> (1660), a meditation on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 5:3, was a sermon preached at Durham; the copy Sprigg presented to Wood is now in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Oxford's visitation commissioners ordered Sprigg's removal from his fellowship at Lincoln on 16 August 1660 on the grounds that he had been improperly appointed and had not lived statutably. When he refused to vacate his chamber, they ordered his ejection on 2 October. His petition of 27 December to the House of Commons for restoration of his fellowship was unsuccessful. Returning to Gray's Inn, he was called to the bar in early 1664, and, according to Wood, rendered legal assistance to James, duke of York. Some time thereafter, Sprigg moved to Ireland and married. From 1670 to 1686 he served as recorder of the borough of Galway, where his position was unsuccessfully challenged by the former recorder John Shadwell, attorney-general for Connaught, in 1673. At Lord Kingston's recommendation, Charles ordered Ormond to appoint Sprigg first justice of Connaught in 1672. In 1682 and again in 1683 the government considered appointing Sprigg king's serjeant, but he demonstrated little interest in the position. Following Kingston's death in 1676, Sprigg served as a trustee to settle his debts. Commencing in March 1683, Sprigg received &pound;100 p.a. from the civil list. Following the deaths of his brother and his widow the following year, he inherited their estate at Crayford, Kent, but he opted to remain in Ireland. He also leased land from the Quaker Anthony Sharp in the barony of Coolestown, King's county (co. Offaly). Sprigg sat in Galway's common council in 1686&#150;7 and again in 1701 and in the Irish parliament as MP for Banagher from 1692 to 1699. There is no further record of him after 1701. Although his Irish career was marked by diligent service, his claim to historical significance rests on his authorship of <span class="italic">The Modest Plea</span> and his linkage of the Baconian and Harringtonian traditions.<br>
