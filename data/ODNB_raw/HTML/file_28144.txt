<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Roger William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Bede]</span>  (1834&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Sydney</span>, born at Courtfield, near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, on 9 January 1834, was the second of the thirteen children of Colonel John Francis Vaughan (1808&#150;1880) of Courtfield, and his first wife, Elizabeth Louisa (1810&#150;1853), daughter of John Rolls of Hendre, Monmouthshire. Four of the five daughters of the marriage became nuns, and of the six sons who became priests, two besides Roger were appointed bishops: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36633/', "Herbert Vaughan")</script>, cardinal-archbishop of Westminster, and John, auxiliary bishop of Salford; another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36631/', "Bernard John Vaughan")</script>, became a Jesuit priest.<br>
<br>At the age of six Vaughan was sent to a private boarding-school in Monmouth, but was withdrawn in 1842 because of poor health. He was to suffer from a weak heart throughout his life. In 1850 he entered St Gregory's College at Downside, near Bath, and on completing his studies joined the Benedictine community there, entering the noviciate on 12 September 1853 and taking his solemn vows on 5 October 1854. The following year he was sent at his father's expense to study in Rome, where he resided at the Benedictine abbey of St Paul's-outside-the-Walls. There he was ordained priest in April 1859. On returning to England he spent two years in charge of the mission at Downside before being appointed in November 1861 professor of metaphysics and moral philosophy at the priory of St Michael at Belmont, Hereford, recently established as the common noviciate and house of studies of the English Benedictine congregation. It also served as the cathedral priory of the diocese of Newport and Menevia. Vaughan was elected prior in 1862, at the early age of twenty-eight, and was twice re-elected. Under his leadership Belmont became a centre of monastic and liturgical renewal. His interest in Thomism bore fruit in the two-volume <span class="italic">Life and Labours of St Thomas of Aquin</span>, which he published in 1871.<br>
<br>As early as 1866 the ageing archbishop of Sydney, John Bede Polding (1794&#150;1877), himself a Downside monk, had tried to obtain Vaughan as his coadjutor, with right of succession, but it was not until February 1873 that Vaughan accepted the appointment. His pedigree commended him to the British government, but not to the largely Irish Australian episcopate, who had hoped for the appointment of one of their number. Consecrated at Liverpool on 9 March 1873 by Cardinal Manning, Vaughan arrived in Sydney to a tumultuous welcome on 16 December. He took up residence at St John's College, and soon established a style more assertive and decisive than that of Polding, by now universally venerated, but a spent force. His imposing stature and dignified manner were of advantage to him in his dealings with the New South Wales government. On the death of Polding in March 1877 he entered into full possession of the metropolitan see of Sydney. He proved combative and even confrontational, taking the bold step of setting up a separate Catholic elementary school system, independent of state aid. He introduced new teaching orders to run the schools, which more than doubled in number between 1873 and 1883. In carrying through this policy he had to face the opposition not only of the state premier, Sir Henry Parkes, but also of some of his own suffragans, who resented his avowed determination to break what he termed &#145;the Irish masonry&#146;. His other major achievement was the successful raising of funds for the construction of St Mary's Cathedral. He presided over its dedication on 8 September 1882.<br>
<br>The strain of conflict and personal isolation took its toll of Vaughan's health. In April 1883 he left Sydney for a European tour which was to have culminated in an <i>ad limina</i> visit to Rome. He landed at Liverpool on 16 August and proceeded the following day to his uncle's house at Ince Blundell Hall, Lancashire. There, on the night of 17&#150;18 August, he died suddenly of a heart attack. He was buried temporarily at Ince Blundell. His death marked the end of the special relationship of the English Benedictines with the Australian church&#151;an association which had begun with William Ullathorne. His Irish successor, Patrick (later Cardinal) Moran, declined to pay the costs of having his predecessor's remains brought to Sydney. They were removed to Belmont in 1887 and remained there until 1946, when on the initiative of Cardinal Gilroy, archbishop of Sydney, they were finally interred in St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.<br>
