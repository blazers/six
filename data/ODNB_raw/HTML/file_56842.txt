<span class="headword">Robinson,  James</span>  (1813&#150;1862), <span class="occ">dentist and anaesthetist</span>, is said to have been born in Hampshire on 22 November 1813, possibly the youngest son of Captain Charles Robinson RN. He had at least one sister, Charlotte. He was reputedly well educated, and at the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a London surgeon and chemist. He enrolled for the 1829&#150;30 session at Guy's Hospital for courses in anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and for the lectures on the teeth; simultaneously he attended courses at University College, London, in clinical medicine and chemistry. Robinson does not appear to have completed his formal medical education and never acquired a qualification from either the Royal College of Surgeons or the Society of Apothecaries. However, he was said to have devoted himself with unremitting ardour to the study of chemistry and the structure of the teeth, and an almost obsessive intensity and unshakeable determination was to characterize all the ventures of this small, excitable, yet sometimes reserved man with dark, piercing eyes.<br>
<br>By 1833 Robinson was practising as a dentist with Thomas Hall, a chemist and dentist, at 8 Store Street, London, and in 1834 he was appointed surgeon dentist to the Metropolitan (later the Royal Free) Hospital. About 1841, and by then already married to Ann Elizabeth Webster (1818/19&#150;1872), he moved the short distance to 7 (later 5 and then 14) Gower Street, the location of his dental practice and his principal residence for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1842 Robinson attempted to form a British society of dental surgeons with the aim of reorganizing the practice of dentistry, then completely unregulated. He founded and edited the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Journal of Dental Surgery</span>, the first British dental journal. Its two issues appeared in March and June 1843 and promoted the concept of an independent body of dentists which would award its own professional qualification. Robinson was also closely involved financially and editorially with a second, more proactive journal, <span class="italic">Forceps</span> (January 1844 to March 1845).<br>
<br>After the reform campaign proved unsuccessful Robinson turned towards writing, and in June 1846 he published <span class="italic">The Surgical and Mechanical Treatment of the Teeth</span>. This was one of the very few dental publications of the period not published exclusively to advertise the author. Perhaps the first British dental textbook, its second part dealt with mechanical dentistry and was addressed primarily to the dental apprentice. Robinson's reforming activities had made his name known in the United States, and on 8 March 1846 he was made an honorary doctor of dental surgery of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. He published two short papers in American journals during this period and it was his American connections which led to his next venture.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1846 the American physician Francis Boott received news from America of the first successful public demonstration (by the dentist William Morton) of ether anaesthesia. He immediately informed his friend and neighbour, James Robinson, and the two set about improvising their own apparatus. It was in Boott's study, on Saturday 19 December 1846, that Robinson administered the first general anaesthetic in Britain. He was soon recognized as the most skilful anaesthetist in the country and his success won over such influential figures as Robert Liston. Robinson withdrew from the forefront of experimentation at the end of April 1847. By now, however, he had published the first book devoted to the subject, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Inhalation of the Vapour of Ether</span>. Perhaps as a result of his experience with anaesthesia, Robinson was appointed dentist to the prince consort in 1849.<br>
<br>When the idea of a college of dentists came once more to the fore in the mid-1850s, Robinson was asked to be the president. Aware that he was by no means the first choice for the position, he initially refused. A few days later he changed his mind, and with the ominous words, &#145;Remember, if I draw the sword, I fling away the scabbard&#146;  (Hill, 72), he became the college's first president, on 16 December 1856. Thereafter he threw himself into the movement with the ferocious (and sometimes counter-productive) energy for which he was noted. By now the advocates of a college were opposed by a small but influential faction (which included John Tomes) who had formed themselves into the Odontological Society to campaign for the Royal College of Surgeons to institute a dental diploma. Since neither group had made much progress by the end of 1857, amalgamation was suggested. However, the general membership of the College of Dentists rejected the plan in January 1858, whereupon Robinson and others went over to the Odontological Society. By June 1858 he was a member of the committee which was planning Britain's second dental hospital, the Dental Hospital of London (later the Royal Dental Hospital), and by July he was a trustee. Friction arose, however, between Robinson and the management over the handling of subscriptions and he was asked to resign at the end of 1860. He then rejoined the College of Dentists, which had meanwhile (in October 1859) opened its own Metropolitan School of Dental Science (later the University College Hospital Dental School). Robinson's return to the fold regalvanized the college, and, due almost exclusively to his unremitting efforts, it opened its own National Dental Hospital (later the University College Hospital Dental Hospital) in November 1861.<br>
<br>Robinson died on 4 March 1862 at his country residence at Kenton House, Harrow, after an accident with a pruning knife. He was buried at Highgate cemetery on 11 March 1862. Robinson's crucial role in the early weeks of anaesthesia was later to be eclipsed by the reputation of John Snow; none the less, his obituaries attest the respect in which he was held by the medical profession.<br>
