<span class="headword">Lytton,  Neville Stephen  Bulwer-</span>, third earl of Lytton  (1879&#150;1951), <span class="occ">artist and army officer</span>, was born on 6 February 1879 in Calcutta, the fourth son and youngest of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17315/', "Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, second Baron Lytton (1831&#150;1891)")</script>, who was created earl of Lytton in 1880, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Villiers (1841&#150;1936). At the time of Neville's birth his father was serving as viceroy of India. Neville Lytton was educated at Eton College (1891&#150;6), and at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts of the Sorbonne in Paris (1896&#150;9).<br>
<br>As a younger son who had apparently little chance of succeeding to the title (although two of his brothers died before his birth), Lytton was able to develop his wide artistic talents. Fluent in French and an ardent Francophile throughout his life, he fell under the influence of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31938/', "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt")</script> while studying art in Paris. He also developed an interest in folk art and the arts and crafts movement. On 2 February 1899 Lytton married Blunt's only child, Judith Anne Dorothea (1873&#150;1957), who succeeded as Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1917. They had one son, Noel Anthony Scawen, born in 1900, and two daughters. Alternating between Paris, London, and his family home at Balcombe in Sussex, Lytton established a reputation as a society painter; he had his first one-man exhibition at the Carfax gallery in 1904, and gave a paper to the Art-Workers' Guild in London in 1907, subsequently published in 1911 as <span class="italic">Water-Colour</span> with a dedication to Blunt, in which he expressed strong opposition to modernism in all its forms. He also owned an ivory flute which he played well, was an accomplished Morris dancer, and won the tennis international amateur cup in Paris three years running (1911&#150;13).<br>
<br>Lytton's main contribution to public life came quite unexpectedly in the First World War. In 1914, with the rank of captain (he became major in January 1915), he helped raise the 11th (Southdown) battalion of the Royal Sussex regiment (&#145;Lowther's lambs&#146;), part of 116th brigade, 39th division. He served with the battalion on the western front in early 1916 before being slightly wounded, and with the brigade staff during the battle of the Somme. In autumn 1916 he was selected for a general staff appointment with section I (d) of general headquarters of the British army in France, as a press liaison and censorship officer. His outspoken war memoirs, <span class="italic">The Press and the General Staff</span>, published in 1920 and illustrated with his own drawings, are an invaluable source on the British army's attitude towards the press and propaganda during the war. He finished the war with four mentions in dispatches and the OBE.<br>
<br>Following the war Lytton settled once more in Sussex. His wartime experience with the press led him to pursue an occasional career as a journalist as well as resuming life as a painter. His discursive and semi-autobiographical book <span class="italic">The English Country Gentleman</span>, published in 1925, includes commemorative essays on Blunt, who had died in 1922, and on his own sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37705/', "Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton")</script>, the suffragette, who had died in 1923. Examples of Lytton's art appear in this book, including the Balcombe frescoes which he completed in 1923. He also edited the volume in the <span class="roman">Lonsdale Library</span> series dealing with <span class="italic">Winter Sports</span> in 1930.<br>
<br>In 1923 Lytton's first wife obtained a divorce, and in 1924 he married Rosa Alexandrine (Sandra) Fortel of St Rambert-en-Bugey, near Lyon. The couple had one daughter. They settled in France, where Bulwer-Lytton became a Soci&eacute;t&egrave;re of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale des Beaux Arts as well as a regular contributor to all major exhibitions in France and Britain. In 1936 he exhibited a portrait of his brother Victor in his robes as second earl of Lytton.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Lytton was employed by the French foreign office to make propaganda radio broadcasts to the United States. After the French defeat in 1940 he and his wife retired to her home town, which was in Vichy France. In autumn 1941 they obtained permission to leave for Portugal and so returned to Britain, circumstances recounted by Lytton in a series of propaganda articles expanded in 1942 into the book <span class="italic">Life in Unoccupied France</span>.<br>
<br>After the war Lytton and his wife settled in France once more. In 1947 he succeeded his brother as third earl of Lytton, but took no part in public life. He died at home in Paris, 8 rue du Val de Grace, of old age on 9 February 1951. His funeral took place at the British embassy church in Paris on 13 February, and he was buried on the same day at Valmondois, Seine et Oise. The son of his first marriage succeeded as fourth earl.<br>
