<span class="headword">Dash,  Jack O'Brien</span>  (1907&#150;1989), <span class="occ">political activist and unofficial dockers' leader</span>, was born on 23 April 1907 in Southwark, south London, the youngest of four sons of Joseph Thomas Dash, a stagehand, and his wife, Rose Gertrude Johns, an actor. According to Dash's own account, his upbringing was one of great material hardship. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was seven and his father, who then had an even greater struggle to support the family, also died of a lung complaint a few years later. After an elementary schooling, his skill at drawing led to a trial period with an engraving firm, but pressure to take home a better wage resulted in a series of menial jobs, starting in a J. Lyons caf&eacute;, followed by spells as an office boy and then as a carrier of books for a wholesaler. After being unemployed for several weeks at the age of nineteen he signed up for two years in the Royal Army Service Corps.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1931 Dash married Ellen Elizabeth Frett (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1980); they had a daughter, Kathleen. After leaving the army, he found it hard to get regular work, though by the mid-1930s he was most often employed on building sites as a hod-carrier. An already strong commitment to trade unionism, further stimulated by the reading of left-wing literature, encouraged him to persuade other building workers on the site to join a trade union, for which he was awarded the Trades Union Congress's Tolpuddle medal. In his autobiography, Dash claimed that he thanked Walter Citrine and Herbert Morrison, the signatories of a citation that accompanied the medal, while pointing out that he had recently joined an organization of which they disapproved, the Communist Party of Great Britain. He remained a loyal, active, and uncritical member of the party for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Dash took part in some of the publicity stunts organized by Wal Hannington and others in the National Unemployed Workers' Movement. These included a visit in December 1938 to the Ritz Hotel by a group of the unemployed who attempted to order afternoon tea. It was after the war (in which he volunteered for the fire service) that his political activities became notorious. In the summer of 1945, when non-registered men were being taken on in the Port of London, he became a docker in the Royal Group of Docks. That he was neither born into the industry nor able to boast dock work as his first and only trade was sometimes held against him, but he soon showed an understanding of the peculiar conditions of the industry and their effects on the workforce. He was most able to influence the actions of his fellow dockers by expressing the grievances that arose from issues of piece-work rates, compulsory overtime, the unloading of dirty or dangerous cargoes, and, even after the Dock Labour Scheme of 1947, the existence of casual employment. Though an ardent trade unionist&#151;in his autobiography he wrote warmly of workers &#145;bound in the finest brotherhood of man, the trade union movement&#146;  (Dash, 163)&#151;he was frequently at odds with the officials of his own union, the Transport and General Workers.<br>
<br>In 1949 Dash and five other dockers were questioned by Arthur Deakin (1890&#150;1955), general secretary of the union, about their agitation to &#145;black&#146; the unloading of the Canadian cargo of the <i>Beaver Brae</i>, in support of a strike of Canadian seamen. Three of the six were expelled from the union while Dash and two others received a two-year suspension from holding office&#151;although communists had recently been debarred by the union from official positions. The exclusion of militants from the councils of the Transport Workers' Union strengthened a separate body claiming to represent rank-and-file workers of which Dash became the chairman in 1958, the London Docks Liaison Committee. This unofficial group, usually numbering five men informally elected at dock-gate meetings, was at the centre of several disputes with employers. Typically on these occasions dockers would leave their work to hear Dash address them, a stocky, pugnacious speaker who usually stood on an old chair and opened with the words he later used for the title of his autobiography, &#145;Good morning, brothers!&#146;<br>
<br>In 1966 Dash's notoriety became more widespread when during the seamen's strike he was named in the House of Commons by the prime minister, Harold Wilson. In a controversial speech which drew on evidence gathered by the secret services, Wilson argued that members of the Communist Party were intent on extending the dispute to trade unions beyond the National Union of Seamen. After identifying Dash as a member of &#145;the unofficial liaison committee in the London docks&#146;, he added: &#145;Mr. Dash &hellip; took a more moderate line because he was torn between his loyalty to the party and his loyalty to his union, which was resisting all pressures to take the Communist line&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, cols. 1619&#150;20). In turn, Dash held that Wilson was &#145;the greatest man in the con business&#146;, one of Labour's &#145;unholy trinity&#146;&#151;in the 1960s the other two were George Brown and Ray Gunter, by the 1970s his derided trinity comprised Wilson, Roy Jenkins, and James Callaghan  (Dash, 155, 33).<br>
<br>Dash's standing as unofficial leader was recognized by Lord Devlin who met him when gathering evidence for his report of 1965 into the port transport industry and took up his suggestion that dockers should have shop stewards. In 1968 Dash was elected as a shop steward, which caused the Transport Workers' Union, then led by the left-winger Frank Cousins, to end its ban on communist officials. Though Devlin's report proposed an end to the system whereby the docks were run on casual labour, the militants argued that decasualization would result in a smaller labour force and the end of restrictive (or, according to Dash, protective) practices. As an alternative, the liaison committee pressed for improved conditions for dockers and the nationalization of the industry. Dash maintained that Devlin's proposals were designed to protect the employers' profits. He could readily quote figures to show how the capitalist system as a whole and the port employers in particular exploited the workers. As he humorously stated in an obituary he composed for a television programme, the epitaph he wished for was:<blockquote>
<div>Here lies Jack Dash<br>
</div>
<div>All he wanted was<br>
</div>
<div>To separate them from their cash.<br>
</div> (Dash, 188)</blockquote>Dash's penchant for colourful phrases, along with a largely hostile portrayal in the press, helped to make him a public figure. In the course of his leadership of an eight-week unofficial strike against the Devlin proposals in late 1967 he received much attention. Yet his personality made it difficult for critics to demonize him. His cockney wit and charm could be disarming. In addition to politics and the docks he talked freely about his enthusiasm for painting and drawing, his fondness for animals (in his younger days he bred dogs), his fitness regime (he was a vegetarian, had boxed and given instruction in physical training), his tastes in music and poetry, and his interest in the history of London. He frequently spoke to audiences of students and occasionally to such groups as rotary clubs. Roy Thomson invited him to a dinner at Claridge's Hotel to address a meeting of millionaires.<br>
<br>Early in 1970, nearing the age of sixty-three and affected by a back complaint that had kept him off work for some time, Dash decided to accept a severance payment of &pound;1500 and to leave the docks. For the rest of his life he followed his hobbies and welcomed opportunities to further his views, travelling widely to address meetings. He remained an uncompromising communist, unreconstructedly repeating the old slogans associated with the party's Stalinist period. Visits to Poland and the USSR had reinforced his beliefs and he expressed support for Soviet policies, including the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.<br>
<br>In his retirement Dash was saddened by the redevelopment of dockland&#151;he observed many of the changes that took place from his top-storey flat in a high-rise council block&#151;and by the level of unemployment, especially of young people, in the East End. During the last few months of his life, despite the onset of what was to be a fatal attack of cancer, he kept up his political work, regularly attending and speaking at meetings. He died on 8 June 1989 in the London Hospital, Whitechapel. The hundreds of mourners at his funeral, held on 14 June at the East London crematorium, were accompanied by trade union banners and sang the &#145;Internationale&#146; as his coffin was draped with the flag of the shop stewards' committee of the Royal Group of Docks.<br>
