<span class="headword">Gex, Sir  John Peter  De</span>  (1809&#150;1887), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of John De Gex, hotel-keeper, of Leicester Place, London, who came from Switzerland but settled in England about the beginning of the century. He matriculated from Jesus College, Cambridge in 1827, graduated BA in 1831, and proceeded MA in 1834, when he also became a fellow of his college. In 1874 he was elected to an honorary fellowship. Having entered Lincoln's Inn on 4 November 1831, he was called to the bar there in January 1835. His name first appears in the <span class="italic">Law List</span> in 1837. For many years he had next to no practice, and devoted himself to reporting. He collaborated with Basil Montagu and Edward Deacon to produce three volumes of <span class="italic">Cases in Bankruptcy</span> (1842&#150;5). In 1852 he published a further volume of cases in bankruptcy, reported by himself alone. At the same time he was reporting cases in chancery, in conjunction with John Smale, which were published in five volumes (1849&#150;53). With Steuart Macnaghten he wrote reports of <span class="italic">Cases in the Court of Appeal in Chancery</span>, known as &#145;De Gex, Macnaghten, and Gordon's reports&#146; (1851&#150;7). Subsequently he wrote on the same subject in collaboration with H. Cadman Jones, F. Fisher, and R. Horton Smith.<br>
<br>De Gex took silk in 1865, in company with Joshua Williams and George Jessel, afterwards master of the rolls. On 19 April following he was elected a bencher of his inn. In 1867 in conjunction with R. Horton Smith he published <span class="italic">Arrangements between Debtors and Creditors under the Bankruptcy Act, 1861</span>, which consisted of a collection of precedents of deeds of arrangement, with an introduction and notes, and a digest of cases. Supplements appeared in 1868 and 1869. In 1871 De Gex became a director of the Legal and General Insurance Office, of which he had been appointed auditor in 1867.<br>
<br>For many years De Gex had an extensive practice in bankruptcy. However in 1869 he played a leading part in the case of the duke of Newcastle against Morris, which belongs as much to constitutional as to private law. The question was whether the duke of Newcastle, not being engaged in trade, was exempt from the operation of the law of bankruptcy on the ground of his being a peer. The bankruptcy court held that he was exempt. The case was elaborately argued before the Court of Appeal, De Gex being the leading counsel for the appellant, and Sir Roundell Palmer representing the duke. Lord Justice Giffard decided in favour of the appeal. In 1882 De Gex was elected treasurer of Lincoln's Inn, and in December of the same year he was knighted on the occasion of the opening of the new lawcourts. He had then recently retired from practice. In 1880 he married Alice Emma, eldest daughter of Sir John Henry Briggs. De Gex died on 14 May 1887 at his residence, 20 Hyde Park Square, London, and was buried on 19 May at Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
