<span class="headword">Cotter,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1689&#150;1720), <span class="occ">Jacobite agitator and rapist</span>, was born in co. Cork, Ireland, the eldest of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47610/', "Sir James Cotter (d. 1705)")</script>, army officer and colonial administrator, and his second wife, Ellen Plunkett (<i>d</i>. 1698), daughter of Lord Louth. The elder Cotter's career had received something of a fillip during Charles II's reign owing to his involvement in the murder of the regicide Lord Lisle in Lausanne in August 1664. The profits accrued from the offices and pension that were subsequently bestowed on him resulted in Cotter's acquiring some property in north Cork to add to the small estate he had been bequeathed by his father, Edmond. Despite his involvement on the Jacobite side during the revolution of 1688, his estates remained intact and were inherited by his son.<br>
<br>On the death of his father the younger Cotter eventually became the ward of Lord Netterville, a local protestant proprietor. However, despite the censure of the Irish House of Commons, his actual care was delegated to a Catholic tutor. By 1710 Cotter had married Margaret Mathew, the daughter of Major George Mathew, a local Catholic landlord, and was already acquiring a reputation as a Jacobite troublemaker. In 1707 he had been involved in an election riot in Tralee, co. Kerry, and in 1713 he was noted as one of the ringleaders in the severe disturbances that accompanied elections in Dublin. Following the accession of George I to the throne, rumours circulated regarding both a potential rebellion in Ireland and an invasion, some of which implicated Cotter as a potential conspirator. In August 1718 he became involved in an incident near Fermoy, co. Cork, which led to his being accused of raping one Elizabeth Squibb. A prosecution was instigated by Edward Fenn, a Quaker and a relation of Squibb's. Although Cotter finally surrendered for trial in July 1719, legal proceedings were delayed. Then at his trial on 17 March 1720 he was convicted and sentenced to death. Despite calls for a pardon by both the grand and petty juries, letters of support from leading protestant gentlemen of the county, an appeal for clemency from the family of the victim, an attempted escape, and the nocturnal demolition of the gallows on the eve of the date set for his execution, Cotter was finally hanged at Cork on 7 May 1720; he was buried the following day in Carrigtwohill. His death caused considerable popular hostility, much of it focused on the Irish Quaker community, who were seen as responsible for his downfall.<br>
<br>Cotter entered local folklore immediately, and in later years was celebrated in Gaelic poetry and popular song as a constant opponent of the protestant ascendancy and a religious and political martyr. Even into the late nineteenth century his execution was cited in popular literature as a symbol of the ruthless suppression of Irish nationalism and Catholicism by the Anglicized protestant state. In recent years most historians have continued to see Cotter's case as at least an example of local religious and political intolerance which resulted in a judicial assassination. However, such conclusions ignore the fact that Cotter was in fact almost certainly guilty of rape, a crime frequently punished by death. In addition, Cotter's father was widely known to have been responsible for the murder of Lord Lisle, the grandfather of Henrietta, duchess of Bolton, wife of the then lord lieutenant of Ireland. This latter fact was seen by at least one contemporary as crucial in circumventing local calls for mercy and guaranteeing Cotter's execution. The lack of precise and unquestionable evidence concerning Cotter's alleged crimes, and the myths and speculation that have grown up around the man, probably mean the exact details of the situation must remain uncertain; but the assertion that he was the victim of a local protestant cabal does seem untenable.<br>
