<span class="headword">Carr, Sir  William Emsley</span>  (1912&#150;1977), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, was born on 30 May 1912 at 9 Pembridge Square, Kensington, London, the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48272/', "Sir (William) Emsley Carr (1867&#150;1941)")</script>, editor and chairman and managing director of the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, and his wife and cousin, Jenny Lascelles (1879&#150;1942), the daughter of (Henry) Lascelles Carr (1841&#150;1902), co-founder and first editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>. Educated at Clifton College (1926&#150;31) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1932&#150;4), where he won a golfing blue, Carr joined the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> in 1937. His father was still at the editorial helm, with William's twin elder brothers Walter Copley Carr (1908&#150;1944) and Henry Lascelles Carr (1908&#150;1943) as his trusty lieutenants and obvious heirs. They had inherited Sir Emsley's business acumen and eye for a good headline. They also shared their father's sporting prowess, his standing in polite society, and above all his remarkable capacity to remain a model of rectitude while at the same time enlivening Sunday mornings across the nation: news of lurid court cases and expos&eacute;s of sexual nonconformity, reluctantly conveyed to open-mouthed readers by shocked but dutiful reporters, provided the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> with a sensationalist recipe for success, its sales peaking around 8 million in the early 1950s. On 22 September 1938 William Carr married Jean Mary (<i>b</i>. 1911), daughter of Neil Forsyth, general manager of the Royal Opera Syndicate. They had a son and a daughter. He volunteered for military service in 1939, serving until 1946 in the Royal Artillery, where he held the temporary rank of major and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>In July 1941 Sir Emsley Carr died, shortly followed by Henry and Walter Carr, both of whom died of illness while serving as pilots in the RAF. William Carr, familiarly known as Bill, was now entrusted with protecting the family stakehold in a business focused on a single purpose: publication every Sunday of a newspaper purchased by half the households in Britain. The formula was simple and successful, the overheads low, and the staff loyal. With a board reluctant to risk change, the price was complacency. Nevertheless, the late 1950s did see the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> pioneer a fresh mix of sexual revelation and criminal investigation, culminating in its coverage of the 1963 Profumo scandal.<br>
<br>Carr did not actually become chairman of News of the World Ltd until 1952. He had already assumed several of his father's honorary appointments in both golf and athletics, not least club chairman at Walton Heath. In 1953 he established in his father's memory the Emsley Carr mile, a one-mile annual invitation race originally run during the British games at the White City. However, despite his membership of the general council of the press, Carr refused to adopt a similar high profile within the newspaper industry. He eschewed any wider responsibility for the well-being of Fleet Street, or of the provincial press, despite acquiring Berrow's Ltd, a group of newspapers concentrated on Hereford and Worcester. Carr was only interested in the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> and its workforce. Knighted in 1957, Sir William entertained lavishly. His largess was legendary, and he indulged his editorial staff, who were always invited to Lady Carr's annual garden party at Bentley Wood, the family's country home in Sussex. The chairman would also foot the bill, including the green fees and the bar tab, at Walton Heath, where staff had the freedom of the course every Monday.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly, by 1960 Carr and his board were poorly regarded in the City. The <span class="italic">News of the World</span> failed to acquire the Newnes publishing group. There were rumours in 1961 of a bid for the ailing Odhams conglomerate; but Carr could see that reversing the fortunes of the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> would prove a hopeless task. Nevertheless, Carr was a director of Reuters from 1960 to 1967, and he was able to identify investment opportunities outside publishing: a new holding company invested substantially in TWW, the Welsh commercial television station, and acquired a 38 per cent stake in the French production company Tele-Europe Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme. Neither of these initiatives was likely to prove a major revenue earner, at a time when sales of the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> were beginning to slip. The company was ripe for a take-over, being highly profitable but poorly led, and heavily dependent upon a single product.<br>
<br>In 1968 Robert Maxwell seized on City rumours that Carr might lose his controlling interest: a cousin's substantial shareholding was for sale, and Carr could not afford to buy him out. Maxwell launched a hostile bid, and Carr looked to the then little-known Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch as his company's saviour. A complicated share deal gave News International its first British title. Carr served as chairman of the new company for three months, with Murdoch as chief executive. But then Murdoch assumed full control. Sir William was left with the honorary titles of life president and consultant to the board.<br>
<br>A generous and convivial man, Sir William Carr lacked the business skills to survive the ruthless approach a new generation brought to boardroom politics in the late 1960s. During his final years, although never short of loyal golfing and drinking partners such as Sir Douglas Bader, he had to cope with serious illness. Carr died on 14 November 1977 at his home, Bentley Wood, Halland, Sussex. He was survived by his wife.<br>
