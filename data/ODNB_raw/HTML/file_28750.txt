<span class="headword">Warmington,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1556, <em>d.</em> after 1627), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, who used the alias Peters, was born in Dorset. His father, whose forename is unknown (<i>d</i>. before 1594), was a recusant and died in Ilchester gaol where he was imprisoned for his faith. His mother was named Eve (<i>d</i>. after 1594) and lived at Wimborne Minster. William matriculated on 20 December 1577 at Hart Hall, Oxford. He left England for the English College at Rheims to be trained as a Catholic missionary priest, arriving there on 7 December 1579. He was ordained at Soissons on 28 May 1580 and was sent to England on 31 January 1581. Arrested in England, he was committed to the Marshalsea prison on 10 December 1582 and was sentenced to death on the false charge of plotting the death of the queen. He was reprieved, however, and banished to France along with a number of other convicted priests. He made for his old college at Rheims, which he reached on 3 March 1585, and then left for Rome on 10 April 1586. Here he became chaplain to Cardinal William Allen. On the death of Allen in 1594 he became an oblate of St Charles.<br>
<br>Warmington decided to return to England to resume his work, and was certainly there in 1603. In 1608 he was arrested and committed to the Clink. In 1612 he gained instant notoriety by publishing a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Moderate Defence of the Oath of Allegiance</span>. The oath of allegiance had been devised by James in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot as a test of Catholic loyalty. Catholics found it objectionable because it contained a clause denying the papal power in temporals. By accepting the oath Warmington was placing himself in opposition to many English Catholics, but not to all. For the government of James it was something of a public relations coup to have a former chaplain of the cardinal of England on their side. It is reported that Warmington was now cold-shouldered by some of his Catholic colleagues. He was given preferential treatment by the government, and in 1612 he was let out of prison and was placed for a time in the household of the Church of England bishop of Winchester. However, it is clear that he continued a Catholic, and between 1626 and 1627 was again imprisoned in the Clink. He ended his life in obscurity, and there seems to be no record of the date or circumstances of his death.<br>
