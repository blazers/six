<span class="headword">King,  Oliver</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1503), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was born in London. He became a king's scholar at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1445&#150;9) and a scholar and fellow of King's College, Cambridge, from 1449 to 1460&#150;65, graduating MA by 1456&#150;7. He then studied civil law at Orl&eacute;ans and Cambridge, gaining a doctorate by 1481. Meanwhile he served as junior proctor of the University of Cambridge (1459&#150;60), was ordained subdeacon (1467) and deacon (1473), and began to collect benefices, starting with the rectory of Broughton, Hampshire, in 1466 and the wardenship of St John's Hospital, Dorchester, Dorset, in 1473. His preferments multiplied thereafter as he advanced in the royal service. King may have been secretary to Edward, prince of Wales, son of Henry VI, during the prince's French exile, but success came in the service of the prince's nemesis, Edward IV. From the clerkship of the signet in 1473 King advanced to the post of principal secretary for the French tongue in 1476. In 1475 he went as ambassador to the duke of Brittany, and in 1479 to the king of France. In 1480 he became the king's secretary; that year alone brought him three prebends and two successive rectories, and on 17 April 1482 he added the archdeaconry of Oxford.<br>
<br>At Edward's death King became secretary to Edward V, but the protector, Richard of Gloucester, dispensed with his services and had him arrested on 13 June 1483. His movements thereafter are obscure, but by December 1485 he was sufficiently in the confidence of Henry VII to be sent on embassy to France. Early in 1486 he was named as a commissioner to survey the king's rights in Calais, and in 1487 he accompanied French ambassadors from London to Dover. The spiral of promotions recommenced in 1487 with another prebend and the archdeaconry of Berkshire, and in August of that year he regained the secretaryship. In July 1488 he was granted a papal licence to visit the churches of his archdeaconries by deputy because he was constantly engaged in the king's business. By that year he was also registrar of the Order of the Garter. The flow of benefices culminated in his provision to the bishopric of Exeter on 1 October 1492 (he was probably consecrated early in February 1493). His promotion was accompanied by a dispensation to retain his other benefices. Three years later he was translated to Bath and Wells, by bull of 6 November 1495. On this final promotion he relinquished the secretaryship, although he continued to sit in the king's council and to take part in great occasions at court.<br>
<br>At Exeter, King appears to have been completely non-resident, but he visited Wells with the king in September 1497, and began to spend more time in his diocese from 1499, staying mostly at Bath. A visitation in that year brought a number of suspected heretics to light, and King heard one case in person, but he never ordained in either of his sees. Dr Thomas Gilbert as vicar-general and Thomas Cornish, bishop of Tenos, as suffragan deputized for him in both dioceses. At Bath and Wells he apparently promised the king the nomination to the major livings in his gift, but became distressed when this resulted in the appointment of a non-resident precentor of Wells&#151;the future archbishop William Warham (<i>d</i>. 1532)&#151;and a consequent decay in the conduct of cathedral services. The other exception he made to this arrangement was in the promotion of his own nephew William Cousin to the deanship of Wells in 1498. In this as in other instances he used the see's resources to provide for his relations, but in his last years he also became a benefactor to his see. He left generous quantities of plate and images to Wells Cathedral and Bath Abbey, and rebuilt the abbey's church with a vault of which his masons promised him that &#145;ther shal be noone so goodely neither in England nor in France&#146;  (Robinson, 4). He claimed that the rebuilding was inspired by a dream, in which he saw the Trinity with angels ascending and descending on a ladder and an olive tree supporting a crown, and heard a voice bidding &#145;Let an olive establish the crowne, and let a king restore the church&#146;  (&#145;Letter to Prince Henry&#146;, 1.9).<br>
<br>King paid attention not only to rebuilding the monks' church, but also to reforming the irregularities in their conduct revealed at visitation. In his will he asked to be buried in the newly built choir, rather than in the chantry chapel he had constructed between 1492 and 1496 in St George's Chapel, Windsor, but it is unclear which site was chosen when he died on 29 August 1503. At Windsor his chapel contains oak panels painted with the pictures of his four royal masters&#151;Prince Edward, Edward IV, Edward V, and Henry VII; at Bath carved ladders and angels alluding to his dream survive on the west front, but the inscription derived from the book of <span class="roman">Judges</span> (9: 8) recorded by Sir John Harington in the reign of James I, and by Thomas Dingley half a century later,<blockquote>
<div>The trees going to chuse their king<br>
</div>
<div>Sayd bee to us that Oliver King<br>
</div>
</blockquote>is now lost.<br>
