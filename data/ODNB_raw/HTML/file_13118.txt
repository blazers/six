<span class="headword">Hervey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lepell]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Hervey of Ickworth  (1699/1700&#150;1768), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 26 September 1700, according to an inscription in Ickworth church, the daughter of Nicholas Wedig Lepell (<i>b</i>. 1665/6, <i>d</i>. in or before 1731), courtier and army officer, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1742), the daughter and coheir of John Brooke of Rendlesham, Suffolk. However, the baptism of a Mary Lepell, daughter of Nicholas and Mary Lepell, is recorded at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 16 September 1699. Her father was born in Santau, Germany, and had arrived in England from Denmark as groom of the bedchamber to Prince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne, in 1683. He was commissioned lieutenant-colonel in Lord Paston's regiment of foot on 1 March 1704, was colonel of his own regiment of foot from 25 March 1705, and was promoted brigadier-general on 1 March 1710. Later that year he became commander of all British forces in Spain, but in 1712 was placed on half pay.<br>
<br>According to a letter written by Sarah Churchill, duchess of Marlborough, in December 1737, Mary Lepell was made a cornet by her father &#145;in his regiment as soon as she was born &hellip; and she was paid many years after she was a maid of honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 1.clii), but no Lepell other than Nicholas appears in the army lists and commission registers for the period. On about 9 February 1715, through family connections with the Hanoverian ministers of George I and her father's friendship with the duchess of Marlborough, she was appointed maid of honour to Caroline, princess of Wales. She rapidly became part of the literary and intellectual circle surrounding the princess. John Gay hailed her as &#145;youth's youngest daughter, sweet Lepell&#146;, and on 17 July 1717 she was mentioned in a poem sent by Gay and William and Ann Pulteney to her fellow maid of honour Mary Bellenden. Alexander Pope described how he was taken &#145;into protection&#146; by the two maids of honour on a visit to Hampton Court that September; Miss Lepell allegedly &#145;walk'd all alone with me three or 4 hours, by moonlight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 1.427). In March 1720 she stayed with Pope at his house in Twickenham, Middlesex, for the benefit of her health. Other friends made at the princess's court were Henrietta Howard, later countess of Suffolk, John Arbuthnot, and Philip Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield.<br>
<br>Mary Lepell had already refused at least one proposal of marriage, from Colonel Adolphus Oughton, a former aide-de-camp to the duke of Marlborough, in 1716. At the time she stayed with the Popes she may have already accepted <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13116/', "John Hervey (1696&#150;1743)")</script> as her husband. Hervey was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13117/', "John Hervey, first earl of Bristol")</script>, and his second wife, Elizabeth Felton. The two were married secretly on 21 April 1720, in order for Mary to continue to collect her quarterly payments as a maid of honour; they announced their marriage on 25 October that year and moved to a house on Bond Street in the fashionable West End of London. They had four daughters and four sons, among whom were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13112/', "George William Hervey, later second earl of Bristol")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13109/', "Augustus John Hervey, later third earl of Bristol")</script>; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13111/', "Frederick Augustus Hervey, eventually fourth earl of Bristol")</script> and bishop of Derry.<br>
<br>Mary became known as Lady Hervey when her husband's elder half-brother Carr died in 1723. She and her husband were perhaps the most celebrated couple in the court of the prince and princess of Wales. In the words of the second verse of a ballad by Pulteney and Chesterfield:<blockquote>
<div>Bright Venus yet never saw bedded<br>
</div>
<div>So perfect a beau and a belle<br>
</div>
<div>As when Hervey the handsome was wedded<br>
</div>
<div>To the beautiful Molly Lepell.<br>
</div> (Stuart, 64)</blockquote>When Lady Hervey bought a new house for her growing family on Great Burlington Street in 1725, the duchess of Marlborough alleged that she had found the money by aggressively flirting with George I, leading the ministry and the duchess of Kendal to buy her off with &pound;4000; Robert Halsband thought it more likely that she had instead called in her debts and asked for money from her husband's father. She was in a position to act as an intermediary for patronage requests, and in summer 1726 successfully won for an aunt's servant the reversion of a place in St Katherine's Hospital, reflecting &#145;I confess that my request runs somewhat high to desire that an old woman may not be forgot; it is more than most people can promise for a young one!&#146;  (ibid., 63).<br>
<br>Following the accession of George II, Lady Hervey was unhappy with the continuation of Sir Robert Walpole in power, and in September 1729 tried to bring Lord Hervey into opposition alongside their old friend Pulteney, but was unsuccessful. Lord Hervey rarely mentions her in his memoirs, and she appears mainly as an obstruction to his political ambitions. Her status at court was enhanced when her husband became vice-chamberlain in 1730; her dairy allowance at Hampton Court in 1731 was the sumptuous three pats of Richmond butter and a quarter-pint of cream per day. She became estranged from Pope, but remained friendly with Pulteney even as he moved further into opposition to Walpole, and with Lady Suffolk before and after her removal from court. In 1732 she recommended to Lady Suffolk Matthew Tindal's <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>, expressing her whiggish interest in rationalism; she would later name Benjamin Hoadly as a friend.<br>
<br>Lady Hervey seems to have tolerated her husband's bisexuality, and became a close friend of his lover Stephen Fox, to whom she sold her house in 1730, although in 1740 she allegedly lent a later passion of her husband's, Francesco Algarotti, the money he needed to leave London and move to Berlin, thereby removing him from her husband's orbit. The 1730s saw some differences emerge between the couple. Lady Hervey damaged the friendship between her husband and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu when she testified to the sanity of the countess of Mar in April 1731; the countess's sister, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, would thus have lost custody of the countess. Despite her pregnancy with her last child, Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1736), Lady Hervey spent most of summer 1735 in France, allowing Hervey to revive his affair with Anne Vane. A few years later her mother-in-law, Elizabeth, countess of Bristol, who was close to Lord Hervey, described her as a &#145;fals, bold Wife&#146;  (Halsband, 239). None the less Lady Hervey continued to have responsibilities at court commensurate with her position as wife of the vice-chamberlain, and in 1738 chose servants for the household of Amalie Sophie Marianne von Wallmoden, mistress of George II.<br>
<br>Lady Hervey's relationship with her husband was to observers good, but he refused to see her for several weeks before his death, on 5 August 1743, and the fashionable world was shocked by the terms of his will, which left Lady Hervey no more than her jointure of &pound;300 a year. The will did not reflect a breach in the family. Lady Hervey lived at Ickworth with her father-in-law, Lord Bristol, almost until his death in 1751, and remained closely involved in supervising the careers of her children. Her letters to the Revd Edmund Morris, tutor to her sons Frederick and William, were written between 1742 and 1768. As edited by John Wilson Croker and published in 1821, they reveal her as widely informed of the world of letters as well as politics, frequently quoting in Latin and Italian, and concerned for the intellectual welfare of her daughters as well as her sons. In a letter of 17 December 1743 she expressed her disillusion with whig politicians, including the Pelhams and her friend Pulteney, whom she felt had been tainted by the proximity of power. Her Francophilia became more pronounced in return, and during the War of the Austrian Succession she referred to France as &#145;my country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Lepel</span>, 64). Over two years of letters, from April 1745 to October 1747, were missing from the manuscript, possibly because Lady Hervey expressed Jacobite sympathies in them. Her interest in early Christianity had led her to conclude that Catholicism was only in error as far as the authority of the papacy was concerned, and all other Catholic doctrines were not superstitious but expressions of the beliefs and practices of the early church. These freely expressed opinions, together with her increasingly obsessive enthusiasm for all things French, may have embarrassed her sons. Her eldest son, George, thought his youngest sisters, Emily and Caroline, were educated as &#145;rank Jacobites&#146;  (Halsband, 307), and he arranged for them to be separated from her. In 1748 she built a new town house in the French style, designed by Henry Flitcroft, in St James's Place, where she entertained a circle of cultural friends and clients which at various times included David Mallet, Edward Gibbon, Chesterfield, Charles and Sarah Lennox, duke and duchess of Richmond, and William Douglas, later fourth duke of Queensberry, among others. She was well known for holding select dinners for six people with common interests.<br>
<br>The maturity of her children, and the death of Lord Bristol, allowed Lady Hervey to spend extended periods in France, where among her circle were the <i>philosophe</i> Claude-Adrien Helvetius and Louise-Anne de Bourbon-Cond&eacute; de Charolais, a granddaughter of Louis XIV. She was at Paris in October 1750 when Chesterfield commended her to his son Philip Stanhope:<blockquote>She has been bred all her life at Courts; of which she has acquired all the easy good-breeding, and politeness, without the frivolousness. She has all the reading that a woman should have; and more than any woman need have; for she understands Latin perfectly well, though she wisely conceals it. (<span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; Chesterfield</span>, 4.1594)</blockquote>Her friendships in France were admired and were to some extent adopted by Horace Walpole. Walpole's &#145;devotion to her was that of a much younger brother rather than a son, and she did not hesitate to take him down a peg when she thought it advisable&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 31.ix). Walpole later dedicated the first three volumes of his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</span> to her (1762&#150;3). She also became a friend of David Hume, making introductions for him in London and Paris, and an admirer of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. By the 1750s she had become reconciled to Pulteney and his wife, now earl and countess of Bath, and during the Seven Years' War her admiration for France was tempered by her regard for Frederick the Great. She became a friend, correspondent, and political confidante of Henry Fox, and acted as an intermediary between Fox and other politicians when Fox was attempting to strengthen his position in the administration following Henry Pelham's death in 1754. She was no friend of the old corps whigs, and expressed great hopes of George III on his accession.<br>
<br>Lady Hervey suffered from gout, and in the 1750s and 1760s spent long periods immobile at her home or at Ickworth. She last visited France in 1755&#150;6. Her sometimes unconventional behaviour had compromised her role as family matriarch, and although from 1754 she was on good terms with her eldest and second sons, she became permanently estranged from her third son, Frederick, and her daughters, particularly her eldest, Lepell Phipps, Lady Mulgrave. The reasons for the estrangement are unclear. The second earl of Bristol was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1766 under the Chatham administration, but she was unable to obtain an Irish bishopric for Edmund Morris from her son. After a long decline, she died at her home in St James's Place, London, on 2 September 1768. She was buried on 9 September at the parish church in Ickworth, where Walpole wrote a verse epitaph for her tombstone. Her will excluded her third son, Frederick, and all her daughters except her second, Lady Mary Fitzgerald, and left an annuity of &pound;60 to her maid Amy Allen, among other bequests to servants and friends, including Henry Fox and Horace Walpole.<br>
