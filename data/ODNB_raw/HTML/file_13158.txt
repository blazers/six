<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hewson,  William</span>  (1739&#150;1774), <span class="occ">surgeon and anatomist</span>, one of the eleven children of William Hewson (<i>d</i>. 1767), surgeon, and his wife, whose maiden name was Heron, was born at Hexham, Northumberland, on 14 November 1739. After attending Hexham Royal Free Grammar School, he was apprenticed to his father, and was also pupil to Richard Lambert, who had formed a medical charity in a house in Gallowgate, Newcastle, which later became Newcastle Infirmary. In 1759 Hewson travelled to London, lodged with John Hunter while attending the anatomical lectures of William Hunter, and studied at St Thomas's and Guy's hospitals. He also took classes in midwifery with Colin Mackenzie and in physic with Hugh Smith. When John Hunter went abroad with the army in 1760 he left Hewson to instruct the other pupils in the dissecting room. William Hunter afterwards proposed to Hewson to take him into partnership as a lecturer if he would undertake a year's study in Edinburgh. Hewson did so, and in the autumn of 1762 he returned to London and began to share in the lectures and the profits of William Hunter's anatomical school, which was then in Litchfield Street, Soho. In 1765 Hewson went to France, Flanders, and the Netherlands to visit the hospitals, but returned to give the winter lectures on anatomy.<br>
<br>In 1768 Hewson visited the coast of Sussex to study the lymphatic system in fishes, and made his researches the subject of a paper communicated in the following year to the Royal Society; his efforts were rewarded with the Copley medal. On 8 March 1770 he was elected FRS.<br>
<br>Hewson's researches on the lymphatic system gave rise to an acrimonious controversy with Alexander Monro secundus of Edinburgh, who, in a letter addressed to the Royal Society, read on 19 January 1769, and in a pamphlet (<span class="italic">A state of facts concerning paracentesis of the thorax, &amp;c., and concerning the discovery of the lymphatic system in oviparous animals, in answer to Mr. Hewson</span>, 1770) claimed the priority in these discoveries. Hewson's reply was given in an appendix to his <span class="italic">Experimental Inquiries</span>, part 1. The minor point of the operation of paracentesis had no reference to the other question; and in regard to this Hewson frankly admitted that he had been anticipated by Monro. But in the more important matters he successfully vindicated his own priority.<br>
<br>In 1769 William Hunter opened the celebrated anatomical school in Windmill Street, where a room was provided for Hewson, who continued in partnership as lecturer, receiving a larger share of profits than before. He also acquired a substantial practice in surgery and midwifery. On 10 July 1770 he married Mary (Polly) Stevenson (1739&#150;1795), who described herself as having &#145;no pretensions to beauty, nor any splendid fortune&#146;  (Richardson, 151). She was, however, a friend of Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman and natural philosopher, who had lodged in her mother's house since he went to London in 1757. She described Hewson as being of slender build, above average height<blockquote>with a good air and pleasing countenance, expressive of the gentleness and sagacity of his mind. &hellip; His manners were gentle and engaging; his ambition was free from ostentation, his prudence was without meaness, and he was more covetous of fame than fortune. (Richardson, 175)</blockquote>On his marriage Hewson moved to a house of his own in Craven Street, and this was made by William Hunter a ground for giving notice of breaking off their partnership. This was a blow to Hewson, especially as the building and anatomical museum necessary for carrying on the lectures were exclusively Hunter's property. A disagreement arose about the right of Hewson to make preparations for his own use, but this was smoothed over by the mediation of Franklin. Hewson used his leisure during the year of notice provided for by the terms of partnership in making preparations for future use in his own lectures, and the museum thus formed was so valuable that it subsequently sold for &pound;700. In September 1772 Hewson began to lecture on his own account at a theatre which he built adjoining his home. His reputation was now so high, especially since the publication of various researches by him in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and of his <span class="italic">An Experimental Inquiry into the Properties of the Blood</span> (1771), that he had no difficulty in attracting a large class, and he lectured for two winter sessions with great success. Early in 1774 he brought out the second part of his <span class="italic">Experimental Inquiries</span>, and his increase of reputation as a lecturer and anatomist was accompanied by a considerable increase in the size of his practice.<br>
<br>Hewson was an excellent anatomist and a physiologist of great originality. His researches on the blood were valuable in establishing the essential character of the process of coagulation, and the forms of the red corpuscles in different animals. They were a good example of the experimental method characteristic of the school of the Hunters. The third part of his <span class="italic">Experimental Inquiries</span>, relating to the blood, was published after his death by Magnus Falconar, who compiled four chapters of Hewson's observations which the latter had never committed to writing.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1774 Hewson wounded himself in making a dissection. Serious symptoms followed, and he died on the morning of Sunday, 1 May 1774, in his thirty-fifth year. According to Mary Hewson &#145;His last moments of recollection were embittered by the idea of leaving me with three children scantily provided for&#146;  (Richardson, 151). He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, but his grave was later lost. His widow, who was left with two sons, gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, in the August following her husband's death; she went, on the advice of Benjamin Franklin, to America. The second son, Thomas Tickell Hewson (<i>d</i>. 1848), after studying at Edinburgh, became an eminent physician and president of the College of Physicians in Philadelphia. Hewson's works were collected and admirably edited by George Gulliver for the Sydenham Society in 1846. A collective Latin edition, <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span>, was published in Leiden in 1795. In 1998 the remains of a number of bodies were discovered during building work at 36 Craven Street; these may have been the remnants of some of Hewson's anatomical researches.<br>
