<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collingwood,  Robin George</span>  (1889&#150;1943), <span class="occ">philosopher and historian</span>, was born on 22 February 1889 at Cartmel Fell, Lancashire, the only son and third of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39918/', "William Gershom Collingwood (1854&#150;1932)")</script> and his wife, Edith Mary (1857&#150;1928), daughter of Thomas Isaac, corn merchant, of Notting Hill, London. W. G. Collingwood, son of the landscape painter William Collingwood, was a writer, painter, and archaeologist, much influenced by John Ruskin, whose secretary (and eventually biographer) he became, while his wife was an accomplished pianist and watercolourist. The family was poor but highly cultivated, and Robin Collingwood was initially educated by his father at home, an education which combined formal instruction with many practical excursions to study and sketch the natural history and archaeology of the area around their home next to Coniston Water in the Lake District. The generosity of a family friend enabled Collingwood to attend preparatory school in Grange for a year when he was thirteen, from where he entered Rugby School in 1903. Collingwood was precocious, with highly developed scholarly and artistic interests and no great enthusiasm for organized games&#151;not a recipe for happiness as a boarder at one of the leading public schools of the period. Thirty years later he recalled with undiminished aversion &#145;the pigsty conditions of our daily life&#146; and the fact that team games &#145;constituted the real religion of the school&#146;. Although by his own account he became &#145;a rebel, more or less declared, against the whole system of teaching&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 8&#150;9), he none the less won a classical scholarship to University College, Oxford, in 1908. There he relished the freedom to pursue his reading without interruption; he seems largely to have shunned the social and athletic life of the university, studying with such unchecked appetite that it may even have been during his undergraduate years that he laid the foundations for his later insomnia and ill health. Having obtained a first in classical moderations in 1910, he proceeded to read <i>literae humaniores</i> or Greats, though, unusually, he chose not to specialize but rather to cultivate both the philosophical and the historical sides of the school. None the less, he made a particular mark in the former, and it was to a fellowship and tutorship in philosophy at Pembroke College that he was elected in the summer of 1912, shortly before his first-class degree result was announced.<h2>
<a name="Earlyphilosophicalworks"></a>Early philosophical works</h2>During the First World War Collingwood worked in the intelligence department at the Admiralty; among other tasks, he wrote a study of the juridical problems of the navigation of the Scheldt up to Antwerp. In 1918 he married Ethel Winifred, third daughter of Robert Chelles Graham, landowner, of Skipness; they had a son and a daughter. In the decade after the end of the war, Collingwood bore an extremely heavy tutorial burden, for some years undertaking the philosophy teaching for Lincoln College as well as for Pembroke; this burden was somewhat alleviated by his appointment as university lecturer in philosophy and Roman history in 1927. But his always intense inner intellectual life managed to find expression in writing throughout this period. His earliest philosophical publications addressed questions of religion and aesthetics, including a short book entitled <span class="italic">Religion and Philosophy</span> (1916) which defended religion as a form of knowledge rather than as a mere expression of need or emotion (he remained a committed if unorthodox Anglican all his life), and an admiring centenary appraisal of Ruskin (published in 1922 as <span class="italic">Ruskin's Philosophy</span>) in which he endorsed the idea of art as an expression of &#145;the whole self&#146;. His first substantial book was <span class="italic">Speculum mentis, or, The Map of Knowledge</span> (1924), an ambitious attempt, in the manner of philosophical idealism, to chart the &#145;forms of experience&#146; as an ascending series, moving through art, religion, science, history, and philosophy. A broadly similar point of view informed <span class="italic">An Essay on Philosophical Method</span>, published in 1933, where the account of the relations between the forms of knowledge is still more emphatically dialectical and historical, so that philosophy becomes consciousness's never-ceasing striving for self-understanding. The work was a thoroughgoing repudiation of the sceptical and nominalist manner of philosophizing favoured among the &#145;realists&#146; and other analytic schools. As one later commentator summarized the force of Collingwood's case, &#145;It follows that philosophy studies not an inert object capable of being split into the clean-cut divisions of a classificatory system, but an object which is living and developing, an object at least akin to, if not identical with, history&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">PBA</span>, 471). <span class="italic">An Essay on Philosophical Method</span> is, in addition, a notably stylish, indeed writerly, book; looking back in 1938, conscious perhaps that his last works would have to be written hurriedly, Collingwood described it as &#145;my best book in matter; in style, I may call it my only book&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 118). Its rather lordly deployment of idiosyncratic distinctions and assimilations is not very helpful, but it does contain a brilliant section on philosophical style itself.<h2>
<a name="RomanBritain"></a>Roman Britain</h2>Throughout his time as an Oxford philosophy tutor Collingwood continued to pursue his researches into the history and archaeology of Roman Britain. His master here had been F. J. Haverfield, professor of ancient history in Oxford, and following Haverfield's death in 1919 Collingwood determined to continue the work of describing and cataloguing all the Roman inscriptions in Britain, a subject upon which he became recognized in his lifetime as the leading authority. He was an active and enterprising archaeologist, directing excavations in northern England nearly every year; he published numerous articles and reports in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society</span> (of which he was for some years joint editor), many of them illustrated by his own sketches. Collingwood insisted that his archaeological work was a practical application of what he was to term the &#145;logic of question and answer&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 37), and on occasion his bold hypotheses about the meaning of the archaeological evidence were spectacularly confirmed, as in his reasoning that if Hadrian's Wall comprised a series of signal-stations, then further signal-stations should have existed along the shores of Cumberland, which later excavations proved to be the case. His standing in the field was acknowledged by the invitation to write, with J. N. L. Myres, the opening volume in the <span class="roman">Oxford History of England</span> entitled <span class="italic">Roman Britain and the English Settlements</span>, which was published in 1936. The bibliography of Collingwood's writings in this area contains, in addition to two other more popular books on Roman Britain, more than 120 shorter items, and though his work was often controversial and sometimes overturned by subsequent findings, he made a remarkable contribution to a subject in which original work is necessarily somewhat technical and highly specialized.<h2>
<a name="Philosophyandhistory"></a>Philosophy and history</h2>Collingwood identified the attempt &#145;to bring about a rapprochement between philosophy and history&#146; as his life's work  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 77), and in the course of the 1930s he thought his way ever more deeply into the problems of historical knowledge, often in courses of lectures which remained unpublished at his death. His most famous dictum, which has been taken as something of a motto for his whole approach, was the claim that &#145;all history is the history of thought &hellip; and therefore all history is the re-enactment of past thought in the historian's own mind&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Idea of History</span>, 215). In this and many other remarks to the same effect Collingwood was identifying what was involved in understanding an intentional human action. It is important that this was intended not as a prescription for the method of historical enquiry, but a description of its success: only insofar as historians can &#145;re-enact&#146; in their own thought what an act meant to its agent can they explain that act. This insistence on the need for imaginative identification with historical agents can be separated from two other, more extreme, views which Collingwood also held: that only intentional actions provide the material of history, and that because history is concerned with the reasons for actions, it cannot have recourse to causal explanation. One of the characteristic and distinctive features of Collingwood's writing on the philosophy of history was the wide range of actual historical examples on which it drew for illustration, thereby bearing out his larger contention that philosophy was essentially a form of reflection on practice and that it always gained in power when the philosopher had firsthand experience of the relevant practice. He underwent fifty sessions of psychoanalysis before considering himself qualified to comment on it  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Essays in Political Philosophy</span>, 81).<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Collingwood had published sketches of these ideas only in a few essays and addresses, though he had devoted several of his Oxford lecture courses to them (further series of lectures on the history of cosmological and scientific thinking were to be published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Idea of Nature</span>, 1945). Collingwood's polished and provocative lectures won him a considerable local reputation at the time; some of his abler tutorial pupils also found him a stimulating, if somewhat intimidating, teacher. But he was always a rather removed figure, visibly absorbed in his own speculation and scholarship, an impression enhanced by his habit of spending weekends and vacations at his house in North Moreton some miles outside Oxford. He took relatively little part in college and university business, though he was a very active delegate of Oxford University Press between 1928 and 1941. He was elected to the British Academy in 1934, an honour all the more welcome for providing him with what he regarded as &#145;a more open-minded audience&#146; than he was used to finding in Oxford  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 116). In 1935 he was elected to the Waynflete professorship of metaphysics, in succession to his friend J. A. Smith; his election entailed a move to Magdalen College. Despite his own sense of isolation and neglect, it would seem that his distinction as a philosopher had been recognized even in Oxford. In 1938, the year in which he published <span class="italic">The Principles of Art</span>, his major work in aesthetics, he was also awarded the honorary degree of LLD by the University of St Andrews.<h2>
<a name="AutobiographyandEssayonMetaphysics"></a>Autobiography and Essay on Metaphysics</h2>The year 1938 was a crisis and turning point in Collingwood's life. In February that year, a few days before his forty-ninth birthday, he suffered a stroke. There had been serious worries about his health for some time: as early as 1932 he had needed a period of recuperation after an earlier breakdown. Now his doctor ordered a complete change of scene. Oxford gave him an entire year's medical leave: Collingwood retired first to his beloved Lake District, where he wrote <span class="italic">An Autobiography</span> (1939); then he embarked on a long sea voyage to the East Indies, a journey which occupied the period from October 1938 to April 1939. After his return he resumed his duties at Oxford, but his health continued to deteriorate, and he finally resigned his chair in 1941. It was during these final years that he wrote some of his most important work, though parts of it had a rather complicated publication history.<br>
<br>Collingwood completed <span class="italic">An Essay on Metaphysics</span> (1940) during his voyage to the East Indies (its preface thanks the captain of the ship for providing &#145;ideal conditions&#146; for the book's composition). After his return he devoted much of his energy to a large, and largely neglected, work of political theory, published in 1942 as <span class="italic">The New Leviathan</span>. But during these years he also began a work on the philosophy of history for which he clearly had high ambitions. For example, he wrote to his son on 14 February 1939 from the East Indies: &#145;I have begun writing <span class="roman">&#147;The Principles of History&#148;</span>, which will go down to posterity as my masterpiece&#146;  (Dussen, 61), and to his friend Gerald Simpson, in late spring 1939, he described it as &#145;the book which my whole life has been spent in preparing to write&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Principles</span>, lviii). But he was never to complete it; his former pupil, T. M. Knox, professor of moral philosophy (and later principal) at St Andrews, drew on one chapter for <span class="italic">The Idea of History</span>, but then the manuscript appeared to have been lost, and it was not published in its entirety (under the title <span class="italic">The Principles of History</span>) until 1999.<br>
<br>The books of this last period were more immediately controversial than Collingwood's earlier work had been. He had become acutely conscious of the threat posed by Hitler and Mussolini, and he deplored the apparent unawareness or even indifference to this threat manifested by so many of his countrymen, including the majority of professional philosophers. For this reason he enthusiastically supported A. D. Lindsay who stood, unsuccessfully, as an anti-appeasement candidate in the Oxford by-election of 1938; &#145;your candidature&#146;, he wrote to Lindsay, &#145;shows the spirit of English democracy is not dead&#146;  (D. Scott, <span class="italic">A. D. Lindsay: a Biography</span>, 1971, 251). These convictions were given forceful expression in some of his later writings. The autobiography, for example, contained not only a swingeing attack on the British government's response to the Spanish Civil War and its policy of appeasement towards Germany, but also a vigorous denunciation of the &#145;realists&#146;&#151;notably John Cook Wilson, and in Cambridge G. E. Moore&#151;for what he saw as their pedantic and uncreative conception of philosophy, and their scepticism about its possible social role. &#145;The minute philosophers of my youth, for all their profession of a purely scientific detachment from practical affairs&#146;, were in fact, Collingwood asserted, &#145;the propagandists of a coming Fascism&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 167). The beard he sported on his return from the East Indies was taken by some of his colleagues as confirmation of a lurch to the left in his political views. <span class="italic">The New Leviathan</span> was in part Collingwood's attempt, by contrast, to put philosophy at the service of his sense of the gravity of the contemporary political situation and to diagnose the nature of the &#145;new barbarism&#146; now threatening civilization.<br>
<br>But perhaps the philosophically most important and original aspect of Collingwood's later work was the elaboration, in <span class="italic">An Essay on Metaphysics</span>, of his radically historicist notion of metaphysics as the exploration of &#145;the absolute presuppositions&#146; of different periods. Collingwood thought that any proposition or statement was (implicitly) an answer to a question, and that every question involved a presupposition of that question's being appropriate or, indeed, intelligible. There are some presuppositions that make questions intelligible without themselves being the answer to any question, and these are &#145;absolute&#146;. It follows that they are not propositions or statements; they are implicit in practice, and not always amenable to being explicitly formulated by those engaged in the practice. It was part of the thorough-going historicism of this final phase of Collingwood's thought that he did not believe, in Kantian manner, that the preconditions of &#145;our&#146; practices of enquiry were universal and timeless&#151;absolute presuppositions are always changing.<br>
<br>Since metaphysics is identified as the study of absolute presuppositions, it seems to be assimilated to the history of ideas. Collingwood was prepared, in a sense, to accept this, both because the study of remoter systems of thought itself involved having those thoughts, and because he saw the present as in effect always &#145;the recent past&#146;. Reflection on the presuppositions of inquiry in the past, and on our own in the present, equally involves the aim, which can never be completely realized, of making an inchoate set of presuppositions coherent. The questions of relativism that have been much discussed by Collingwood's commentators in this connection are perhaps best directed to the issue of how far criteria of coherence are themselves historically variable.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>Collingwood's final years also saw significant changes in his hitherto settled way of life. He was always a keen sailor, and only a couple of months after returning from his East Indian voyage he set out with a group of Oxford undergraduates to spend the summer sailing round the Aegean; he published the journal of this voyage as <span class="italic">The First Mate's Log</span> in 1940. After resigning his chair in 1941, he moved first to Berkshire, and eventually to Lanehead, the family home he had inherited at Coniston. In 1942 his marriage was dissolved on his wife's petition, and in the same year he married Kathleen Frances, daughter of Francis Edgcumbe Edwardes, schoolmaster; they had one daughter. Collingwood died of pneumonia at Coniston on 9 January 1943; he was buried in the local churchyard three days later.<br>
<br>Though he always repudiated the label of idealist, Collingwood's work recognizably belonged to that style of philosophizing which, broadly speaking, took its inspiration from Hegel's critique of Kant. He claimed that T. H. Green and his followers, though often labelled Hegelians, especially by their opponents, really represented &#145;a continuation and criticism of the indigenous English and Scottish philosophies of the middle nineteenth century&#146;  (Collingwood, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 15). His work displays particularly close affinities with the philosophy of the Italians Croce and Gentile, though not with the latter's fascist politics; he translated several works by Croce and by his good friend Guido de Ruggiero (Collingwood was an exceptionally accomplished linguist, moving easily in several modern European languages as well as, of course, being proficient in Latin and ancient Greek). But philosophical idealism of any kind was out of favour in Oxford in the 1920s and 1930s, where first the &#145;realist&#146; school led by Cook Wilson was dominant, until that in turn was challenged by the beginnings of logical positivism and &#145;ordinary language&#146; philosophy. Collingwood, by nature an intellectual loner and something of a social recluse, resented what he felt to be his philosophical isolation in Oxford, indeed in Britain more generally, and his lack of engagement with the work of his contemporaries may have contributed to the neglect into which his work fell immediately after his death. Such reputation as he did continue to have rested largely on <span class="italic">The Idea of History</span>, published posthumously in 1946. This work drew on essays, lectures, and drafts mostly written during the 1930s, including some material from the manuscript left incomplete at the end of his East Indian voyage of 1938&#150;9; Knox was responsible for the selection and arrangement of the material (as also of <span class="italic">The Idea of Nature</span>), making editorial decisions of which later scholars have not always approved.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Idea of History</span> has become something of a classic in a field not over-supplied with classics written in English. This standing was to some extent a by-product of a broader development, to which the book in turn contributed, namely, the rise of the philosophy of history as a reputable sub-field in the course of the 1950s and 1960s (more reputable among historians than among philosophers, perhaps). Collingwood's emphasis upon history as the interpretation of purposive action, and hence upon the primacy of the need to recover historical agents' own understanding of their situation, provided a valuable antidote to the aridities of the neo-positivist attempt to reduce historical explanation to the general operation of causal laws. &#145;If the philosophy of history is now in a flourishing state in English-speaking countries&#146;, observed one authority in 1995, &#145;this is due in no small measure to the stimulus provided by the writings of R. G. Collingwood&#146;  (Dray, 1).<br>
<br>With the revival of interest in Collingwood's work which began in the 1960s and 1970s, several of his other works, particularly <span class="italic">An Essay on Philosophical Method</span> and <span class="italic">The Principles of Art</span>, have won fresh admirers, not least for the elegance of their style. <span class="italic">An Essay on Metaphysics</span> contains interesting ideas, some of them related to questions about practice and its reflective description, that are also raised by the later work of Wittgenstein. For most readers, however, it seems likely that the two works by which Collingwood has been best-known since his death&#151;<span class="italic">An Autobiography</span> and <span class="italic">The Idea of History</span>&#151;will remain the most widely read, and with good reason. It was in these two books that he came nearest to realizing his ideal of persuading a wide readership to think seriously about the distinctiveness of history as a form of knowledge. Through these works he almost single-handed kept alive an anti-positivist understanding of history through a dark period largely dominated by the narrow sympathies of analytic philosophers and the brisk empiricism of political historians. Only in the closing decades of the twentieth century was his achievement fully recognized, installing him as the presiding spirit of a remarkable efflorescence in the English-speaking world of enquiries into the nature and scope of historical understanding.<br>
