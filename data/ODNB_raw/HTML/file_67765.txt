<span class="headword">Knowlys,  Newman</span>  (1758&#150;1836), <span class="occ">barrister and judge</span>, was born in London, the fourth son of William Knowlys, merchant, of Harp Lane, Tower Street, London. Educated at Botesdale and Christ's College, Cambridge (he did not obtain a degree), Knowlys was admitted to the Middle Temple on 22 January 1774 and called to the bar on 8 February 1782. He was elected common serjeant of London in 1803 and became recorder in 1822. Knowlys was made a bencher of his inn in 1817, reader in 1819, and he was treasurer in 1826.<br>
<br>As a barrister Knowlys's practice lay chiefly in the criminal courts of metropolitan London and the City's customary courts. In the 1780s barristers began to appear in Old Bailey trials with some regularity, although the majority of cases continued to be heard without the involvement of counsel for either the prosecution or the defence. Knowlys was one of the roughly dozen men who formed a nascent criminal bar in London; he began to practise at the Old Bailey immediately after his call to the bar and between 1783 and 1803 he was engaged in over 1300 cases heard in that court. During the 1790s Knowlys shared the leadership of Old Bailey practice with Jerome William Knapp.<br>
<br>Although he enjoyed little success in Westminster Hall, Knowlys's purchase of a City common pleadership in 1787 made him one of four barristers who held the exclusive right to practise in the lord mayor's and sheriffs' courts of London. The majority of cases heard in these courts related to the recovery of small debts. The combination of a pleadership and Old Bailey practice was typical of the period. He was the second individual (the first being John Silvester) to hold successively the City offices of common pleader, common serjeant, and recorder of London. Advocates of what came to be known as the principle of rotation argued that practice in the City courts provided the best preparation for the subsequent positions, offering a solid grounding in London's municipal law. Critics pointed out that pleaderships were won not by talent but through purchase and that they were filled by an inferior grade of practitioner. City pleaderships provided a refuge for those barristers whose talents or connections were not such as to enable them to succeed in the superior courts. Yet the acquisition of a pleadership offered the recipient a ticket in the &#145;city lottery of law&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 April 1822), granting him a one in four chance of ultimately obtaining the recordership.<br>
<br>By the end of Knowlys's legal career both the system and its results were widely condemned. His recordership was bounded by negative publicity and did much to bring that office into disrepute. <span class="italic">The Times</span> had opposed his election, dismissing him as &#145;a mere practitioner in the courts&#146;  (1 April 1822), entirely lacking in the requisite personal dignity and legal ability, while the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> despised him for his reactionary opinions. Like his predecessor John Silvester, Knowlys was known to oppose reform of England's severe criminal law.<br>
<br>As common serjeant and later recorder of London, Knowlys's duties included sitting as a judge at the Old Bailey. The <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> compared his common serjeantship with that of the notoriously brutal George Jeffreys. Shortly before his election as recorder that paper commented on his &#145;unparalleled severity&#146; and &#145;bare-faced system of <i>frightening</i> a jury into a verdict of conviction&#146; in the trial for libel of Richard Carlile  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 6 March 1822). One critic claimed that he had turned the Old Bailey into a &#145;bear garden&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 73/4, &#145;Rudolph's and Wilson's case&#146;, Aug 1827). Knowlys was forced to resign in disgrace in 1833 after issuing a warrant of execution for one Job Cox, who had received a royal pardon. He remained steward of the borough court of Southwark until his death.<br>
<br>Little is known of Knowlys's family or personal life. He was married relatively late in life to Mrs Slope (<i>d</i>. 1837), a widow of Bath, on 15 August 1807. They had no children. Knowlys died on 5 January 1836 at his house in James Street, Buckingham Gate, London, and was buried in the Middle Temple vault. His wife died on 19 November of the following year.<br>
