<span class="headword">Boaks,  William George</span>  (1904&#150;1986), <span class="occ">road safety campaigner and parliamentary candidate</span>, was born on 25 May 1904 at 104 Warner Road, Walthamstow, Essex, the son of William Robert Boaks, a vegetable salesman's cashier, and his wife, Annie Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer. Educated in elementary schools, he entered the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman during the First World War, perhaps aged only twelve. Boaks enjoyed a varied and distinguished naval career, rising through the ranks to retire in 1949 as a lieutenant-commander. During the Second World War he was gunnery officer on HMS <i>Rodney</i> in the engagement with the <i>Bismarck</i> and commanded HMS <i>Basilisk</i>, a corvette, at Dunkirk, for which he was awarded the DSC. He married Ivy June Collier (1909&#150;1997) in 1930 and they had three children.<br>
<br>On leaving the navy Boaks settled in south London, took a job in local government, and embarked upon his eccentric campaigning career. Standing as an independent, he mistakenly contested Walthamstow East in the general election of 1951, having intended to oppose Clement Attlee in the west division; Boaks received just 174 votes in a poll of over 40,000. In 1956 he fought Walthamstow West when Attlee retired. Throughout his political career he campaigned for better road safety. Rather than canvass, or issue leaflets, he painted his car as a zebra crossing and decorated it with placards bearing slogans, a mast and sail, and loudspeakers. Later he devised a reinforced bicycle laden with placards for the same purpose.<br>
<br>Boaks's early campaigning activities led him to become a regular visitor to the law courts in the 1950s and 1960s. He was fined once in 1952 and twice in 1953 for using his car as an advertisement. In 1955 he was convicted of obstructing the highway by stopping his car in the middle of London's Kilburn High Road when traffic was heading away from a major football international at Wembley stadium, and again at Cambridge Circus in the city centre. Later that year he blocked up the Strand and broadcast his argument with a policeman over his car's loudspeakers to the gathering crowd. This led to a period in custody when a magistrate requested an assessment of Boaks's state of mind, but he was eventually given a conditional discharge. He sued the magistrate involved for wrongful imprisonment and took his case to the House of Lords but received no satisfaction.<br>
<br>In 1959 Boaks failed in an attempt to summons Lady Attlee for causing death by dangerous driving following a serious road accident in which she had been involved. Undaunted, he tried again in 1960 after Lady Attlee was involved in another crash, and in 1964 he unsuccessfully sought the summons of the queen and the duke of Edinburgh for the same reason. Boaks himself was reprimanded in court in 1963 for helping to cause a crash in which a girl was injured after he stopped for her to cross at traffic lights which were green.<br>
<br>Boaks championed other causes as well as the rights of pedestrians. In his early election contests he demanded equal pay for women and tax-free allowances for children. These ideas later became part of the political mainstream, although others were more unusual. He was an enthusiast for helicopters and asked for planning permission for a heliport in his own garden. He wanted inland airports closed and replaced by coastal heliports instead. Opposition to immigration also became a theme of his campaigns. Allowed six words of description on ballot papers after 1970 he chose &#145;Public Safety Democratic Monarchist White Residents&#146; but he would have liked many more.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1960s his intentions to stand for election came to nothing, but after 1970 Boaks became a regular feature in parliamentary elections throughout the country. He fought Clapham in 1970 and three London seats in the general election of February 1974, achieving the best result of his career&#151;240 votes&#151;in Wimbledon, his home constituency. Between 1976 and 1982 he contested eighteen by-elections, polling only five votes in Glasgow Hillhead in 1982, the lowest poll of any parliamentary candidate in modern times.<br>
<br>Boaks was involved in a road accident in November 1982 and never fully recovered from the head injuries he suffered. He died on 4 April 1986 in St George's Hospital, Tooting, of pneumonia and heart failure. Boaks's long-standing interest in road safety was widely admired and the transport minister, Peter Bottomley, attended his funeral. He was buried at sea, in the naval graveyard outside Portsmouth harbour, with full honours.<br>
<br>A maverick political campaigner, who enlivened the political scene for many years, Boaks differed from other perennial by-election candidates in the earnestness with which he held his views and the lengths to which he was prepared to go to publicize them. Rather than demean politics, he demonstrated how anyone unprepared to conform with mainstream views could put them before the electorate for judgement, although at a cost; he lost over &pound;3000 in deposits. He was sure that, in his case, the line between success and utter failure was thin. After his triple defeat in February 1974 he declared: &#145;If I had been elected I would have been the next Prime Minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 March 1974).<br>
