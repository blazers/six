<span class="headword">Argall,  Thomas</span>  (1499/1500&#150;1563), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was probably born at Lambeth, the only son of John Argall and his wife, Emme. His date of birth is derived from the fact that in July 1540 he gave his age as forty. Both parents were deceased by 1522, when Argall inherited their home and close on the archbishop of Canterbury's Lambeth estate. Argall's first known employment was as private clerk to John Barret, registrar of the prerogative court of Canterbury. Following Barret's death in 1526, Argall served under John Cockes, master and commissioner of the prerogative, dean of the arches, auditor of causes, and vicar-general in spirituals, and also entered practice as a notary public. He was drawn into the annulment proceedings of Henry VIII's marriage to Katherine of Aragon in 1533, when identified as a servant of the royal chaplain and councillor Thomas Bedell. In 1534 Argall received his first important office when Thomas Cranmer appointed him registrar of the prerogative court of Canterbury, a post he held until his death. Between 1536 and 1540 he was concurrently registrar of testimonial matters to William Petre, Thomas Cromwell's deputy as royal vicar-general and vicegerent in spirituals.<br>
<br>By December 1536 Argall was occupied with clerical duties for the dissolution of the monasteries, employed directly under Thomas Cromwell. Upon the creation of the court of first-fruits and tenths in 1540 Argall secured appointment as keeper of the records from his long-time acquaintance Sir John Baker, the formal grant of office being delayed until 10 March 1542. Argall emerged as one of the court's most active officials, a prominent administrator and important revenue receiver. This activity was recognized in 1554 when the functions of the dissolved court were transferred to the exchequer and Argall and Thomas Godfrey, the clerk, became joint remembrancers of first-fruits and tenths for life. Other administrative tasks continued to occupy his attention: under Edward VI, Argall produced the particular accounts for all colleges, chantries, and free chapels; and in Mary I's reign he aided in the sale of former monastic lands, and served under Baker and Petre in assessing fines arising from Wyatt's rebellion. In summary, between 1540 and 1563 Argall was one of the most prominent royal administrators of clerical revenue and accounts. With a career spanning the reigns of four sovereigns, he helped create administrative stability within a period of flux, providing unity between church and state and fostering an important element of continuity with the past.<br>
<br>Argall's marriage, friendships, and purchase of a landed estate reflected his ties to the archbishop of Canterbury's London administration and Sir John Baker, Argall's principal patron in his later career. By 1544 Argall had married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1592), a daughter of John Tallakarne, of Camrose, Cornwall, a proctor of the court of arches and Argall's neighbour in the parish of St Faith's under St Paul's. The marriage produced six sons and one daughter: Richard (<i>d</i>. 1588), Laurence (<i>d</i>. 1585), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/638/', "John Argall (d. 1606)")</script>, Rowland, Gabriel, Edmund, and Anne. Margaret outlived her husband, married Sir Giles Alington of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire, and died in 1592. Argall purchased considerable property, and by 1563 he held lands in Sussex, Kent, Essex, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, and Dorset. His greatest acquisitions were in west Kent, beginning in 1544 with the purchase of land in Tenterden formerly owned by Thomas Cromwell, for &pound;433, and followed by the purchase of the manors of East Sutton and Densted in 1546.<br>
<br>Argall's introduction into the county gentry of Kent was marked by the marriage of his eldest son and heir, Richard, of the Inner Temple, to Mary, a daughter of Sir Reginald Scott of Scot Hall. That marriage produced five sons and six daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/640/', "Sir Samuel Argall")</script>, deputy governor of Virginia, and Elizabeth, mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9424/', "Sir Robert Filmer")</script>. Argall was a learned layman in religious subjects and a theological conservative whose beliefs reflected pre-Reformation orthodoxy; his 1563 will used a traditional formula. He died on 15 August 1563 at his home in Ivy Lane, London, and was buried within the church of St Faith's under St Paul's.<br>
