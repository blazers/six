<span class="headword">Boruwlaski,  Joseph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>J&oacute;zef Boruslawski]</span>, styled Count Boruwlaski  (1739&#150;1837), <span class="occ">travelling performer and memoirist</span>, was born in November 1739 near Halicz, Galicia, Poland, the third son of a lower gentry family. The principal source for his life is his own memoirs, published in several editions between 1788 and 1820. When he was nine his father died, leaving a widow with five sons and one daughter. Three sons were very tall, but three children suffered from achondroplasia, an inherited condition in which the cartilage in the bones fails to grow. Boruslawski's eldest brother was 41 inches tall, and his younger sister was even smaller. J&oacute;zef (known familiarly as Joujou) grew very slowly. At fifteen he had grown to 2 feet 1 inch, at twenty-one he was 2 feet 4 inches, at twenty-five he was 2 feet 11 inches, and at thirty reached his maximum height of 3 feet 3 inches. Boruslawski's mother, left poor, had her achondroplasic children adopted into noble households. Anastasia was 2 feet 4 inches high when she died of smallpox, aged twenty. The eldest brother was at Castellan Inowlowski's wife's court until his death.<h2>
<a name="ProtgofMadameHumiecka"></a>Prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Madame Humiecka</h2>Boruslawski was entrusted first to Madame Jaorlicka, widow of the starostin de Caorliz, one of sixteen regional officers of state, and was well treated and educated. When he was fifteen Madame Jaorlicka married Count de Tarnon, and he was transferred to Madame Humiecka, described as &#145;Lady sword bearer&#146; (that is, wife of the sword-bearer); she was not a countess as stated in Boruslawski's memoirs. Madame Humiecka travelled Europe with her household, introducing Boruslawski to the most famous European salons. She dressed him as a lieutenant of a great Polish regiment, and her drawing-room contained his diminutive sofa, table, chair, billiard table, and other games. Among the courts they visited were that at Vienna in 1752, where Boruslawski was presented to the empress Maria Theresa and learned dancing from Angelini, the electoral court of Bavaria at Munich, and the court of Stanislaw Leszcz&yacute;nski, former king of Poland, at Luneville in Lorraine. Here he met Count de Tressan, who described his manners and exceptional intelligence in the <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die</span> in 1766. King Stanislaw introduced Madame Humiecka to his daughter Queen Maria at Versailles, where Boruslawski entertained Louis XV's court. There Count Michal Oginski, grand general of Lithuania, began to teach him music, and arranged further tuition from the leading guitarist Gaviniesa. Music would become a vital source of income.<br>
<br>In 1760 Madame Humiecka took her entourage to The Hague, from where a report on Boruslawski was sent to the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> in London, noting his graceful manners, wish to be treated as a nobleman, and his wit, liveliness, memory, and literary and linguistic abilities. When they returned to Warsaw, Madame Humiecka conceded that he was now an adult and he was allowed visits to theatres and parties alone. This independence proved to be limited when Madame Humiecka disapproved of his dissolute companions and threatened to withdraw her protection.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandindependence"></a>Marriage and independence</h2>About 1778 Boruslawski fell in love with Izalina Barboutin (<i>c</i>.1763&#150;<i>c</i>.1790/91), an attractive dark-haired girl of fifteen, of normal stature; of French descent, she had joined Madame Humiecka as a companion. She mocked him initially; but his persistence and showers of love letters convinced her he was serious. Courtship followed late in 1779, but Madame Humiecka dismissed them both in anger. They married in 1780, under the protection of Prince Kazimierz Poniatowski and his brother, King Stanislaw II. The king granted Boruslawski a carriage and an annual pension of 120 ducats, and may also have allowed him to call himself a count, although there is no evidence for this beyond the memoirs. The couple left for Krak&oacute;w, where a daughter was born.<br>
<br>Boruslawski had known that the pension would not be enough to support his growing family, and he began the precarious business of earning a living. Madame Humiecka had exhibited him to a select audience as a novelty; as his own man he attempted to be taken seriously as an impoverished gentleman and as a musician, but his diminutive proportion would always be the factor that aroused curiosity. In Vienna in February 1781 a concert was cancelled as the city was still mourning Maria Theresa, but Sir Robert Murray Keith, the British ambassador, suggested that Boruslawski visit England, and provided letters of recommendation. The 1820 edition of the memoirs states that Boruslawski then travelled through the Balkans, Arabia, and Asia as far as Kamchatka and the Bering Strait, but this would have been an impossible journey in the time allowed and is probably an example of the exaggerated traveller's tales he entertained his audiences with in later life. The 1788 memoirs suggest instead that he earned his living seeking hospitality at minor German princely courts.<h2>
<a name="ArrivalinEngland"></a>Arrival in England</h2>In late 1781, while visiting Christian Friedrich, margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, at Triersdorff, Boruslawski revived the plan to visit England. The margrave agreed to care for his eldest child, and Boruslawski and Izalina left with introductory letters to George III's brothers, William, duke of Gloucester, and Henry, duke of Cumberland, and to William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire, and more importantly to his wife Georgiana, the leading whig political hostess. The Boruslawskis landed at Margate on 21 March 1782 and proceeded to London where Boruslawski was for a period taken up by the Devonshires. The duchess found him accommodation and the duke gave him a suit embroidered with silver and precious stones, and a silver sword. At Devonshire House he met the prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) and the duke of Gloucester, to whom he presented his letter from the margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. The Polish ambassador arranged a visit to the royal family on 23 May. There he was treated as a Polish nobleman, and he discussed his travels with George III.<br>
<br>The press reported wrongly that the king gave Boruslawski money. As he needed more than presents, Georgiana arranged a supposedly spontaneous meeting between him and the Irish giant Charles Byrne, known as O'Brien, who was 8 feet 4 inches tall. The publicity failed to have a great effect on Boruslawski's income. Society soon tired of him, and it may have been the need for popular acclaim that led him to simplify his name. Advertisements in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> for his concerts on 7 June 1782 and 19 June 1782 at Carlisle House described him as &#145;Count Boruwlaski&#146;. The concerts were priced at 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; he later wrote that prices were forced down to 5<i>s</i>., and then to 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. He needed to leave London to earn more, as he now had three daughters, and estimated that he needed &pound;500 annually for travelling, organizing concerts, and hiring rooms for entertaining.<br>
<br>Joined by Izalina's uncle, de Trouville, Boruwlaski and his family left for Bath, but his initial success was eclipsed by a trained pig. He returned to London, where a collection for his benefit failed, the duchess of Devonshire (succumbing to a widespread superstition) refused to admit him lest the sight of him dwarf her expected child, and a concert was unprofitable, partly through the lack of interest of the prince of Wales.<h2>
<a name="TouringtheBritishIsles"></a>Touring the British Isles</h2>In April 1783 Boruwlaski travelled to Ireland, where he was able to renew his success. Thanks to introductions to Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle, lord lieutenant of Ireland, and his successor, Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, leading Irish families entertained him. Boruwlaski said he spent two years in Ireland, a stay protracted by Izalina's pregnancy, but he was in Cheshire in November 1783 when he became a freemason. Boruwlaski may have realized that it was unlikely that he would enjoy permanent favour from the nobility, and on his return to England, perhaps in early 1785, concentrated his attention on the provinces. He and his family travelled through Liverpool and Manchester to Leeds, and late in 1785 arrived in Birmingham. There Boruwlaski lodged in a house belonging to a man called Hutton where, as usual, he entertained guests for a small admission fee. The Boruwlaskis were invited to Christmas dinner by the Huttons, and Boruwlaski established a lasting friendship with Hutton's daughter, Caroline. She noticed that Boruwlaski had little English but great charm and good manners. Izalina spoke good English, was talkative, laughed easily, and sang French songs, but Caroline thought her character made her an unsuitable wife for Boruwlaski. With them were their pretty middle daughter and the youngest, a baby, the eldest being still at the court of the margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. From Birmingham the Boruwlaskis returned to London via Oxford, where Boruwlaski was taken to Blenheim Palace and gave a pair of his shoes to George Spencer, fourth duke of Marlborough, for the duke's collection of curiosities. By 27 March 1786 Boruwlaski was in London, where, as &#145;Sieur Boruwlaski&#146;, he advertised his presence in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>; visitors were invited to call on him at 162 Strand, for the price of 1<i>s</i>. An anonymous letter includes a sketch of his guitar performance before the sultan of Turkey, two guards, and three ladies of the harem, indicating that tales of his travels, real or imagined, were an established part of his repertory. His old friend Oginski was now in London, an exile from a Poland torn by political factions and about to be partitioned, and supported a concert on 30 June 1786; the prince of Wales was invited but, although he had lunch with Boruwlaski beforehand, failed to attend. There was a good audience but only Oginski's subsidy averted financial failure. Boruwlaski's long absence from Poland led to his pension being cancelled, as it was rumoured that he had great investments in Britain. Another Polish exile, Princess Lubormirska, arrived in 1787 and generously paid his debts of 50 guineas, when creditors threatened him.<br>
<br>In 1788 <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires du c&eacute;l&egrave;bre nain Joseph Boruwlaski</span> with a parallel English translation by A. J. Des Carri&egrave;res was published in London. The subscription list of hundreds of names includes the prince of Wales, members of the aristocracy, and several distinguished Poles. It was dedicated to the duchess of Devonshire, perhaps in a bid to renew Boruwlaski's association with the fashionable world, but publication did not improve his finances. A German translation appeared in Leipzig in 1789.<br>
<br>Boruwlaski's advertisements in 1786 had forecast his imminent return to Poland, but he remained in England, probably for financial reasons. His wife, her uncle, and her children disappear from his memoirs at this point; they may have deserted him, perhaps to return to Poland; his regret for neglecting &#145;a generous man&#146;  (<span class="italic">M&eacute;moires</span>, 1st edn, 245) with Polish connections, in favour of bad advisers, could refer to de Trouville. His narrative, as continued in the 1792 edition, mentions periods at Norwich (where the diarist James Woodforde saw him in 1788) and Edinburgh, the latter visit supported by the family of the earl of Dumfries; the aristocracy was still his preferred milieu. However, the 1820 edition emphasizes his renewed acquaintance in Cambridge at this time with Margaret Metcalfe and her unmarried sisters, whom he had met in London in 1782; they helped to promote successful concerts in Cambridge and on their family estate at Bury St Edmunds. The Metcalfes, presumably of lower gentry or middle-class origin, would be more typical of Boruwlaski's enduring admirers.<br>
<br>From Edinburgh, Boruwlaski travelled south to France, collecting money on the way. He arrived in spring 1789, and performed in Boulogne, in Lille, and in Paris, but attributed his lack of success to the outbreak of revolution that July and two thefts. He returned to England, via Cherbourg and Guernsey, in spring 1790. He then made a final visit to Poland, in 1790 or 1791; his wife died about that time.<br>
<br>On returning to England in 1791 in poverty, Boruwlaski tried the west midlands, where he was unknown, and appeared successfully in Hereford. With a depleted income, he resorted to a paid appearance with a giant. He then returned to Birmingham, where &#145;guests&#146; paid 1<i>s</i>. admission. At the Huttons, Caroline noticed his melancholy and the absence of his wife and family. He was now fifty-three years old with no prospects. Two new editions of the memoirs appeared in Birmingham in 1792, one in French, the other in English, updating the 1788 publication.<br>
<br>According to the 1820 edition of the memoirs Boruwlaski spent much of the succeeding decade in Ireland, where he visited most of the major towns. The account in the memoirs is highly anecdotal and peppered with humorous stories about his Irish servant Noad and observations on the French invasion attempts by Hoche in 1796 and Humbert in 1798. The invasion panic and threat of rebellion &#145;made such an impression on my strongbox&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 4th edn, 327) that he left Ireland, probably in 1798, for the Isle of Man and then England.<h2>
<a name="ThenorthofEnglandandretirement"></a>The north of England and retirement</h2>Boruwlaski then toured the north of England; James Ballantyne published a further edition of the memoirs at Kelso in 1801, probably with the northern English audience in mind. The connections that Boruwlaski made in the north of England at this time were to secure his future. With the help of General Archibald Dickson, he writes, he staged a successful concert at Newcastle, and was introduced by Dickson to Thomas Ebdon, cathedral organist at Durham, who in turn introduced him to &#145;Mr Smelt&#146;, an old friend of George III. The chronological sequence of events in Boruwlaski's memoirs may be confused; a letter in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in September 1802 states that Boruwlaski stayed with Dickson that May, but if &#145;Mr Smelt&#146; is Leonard Smelt, the former sub-preceptor to the prince of Wales, as seems to be implied, then these events must have taken place before Smelt died on 2 September 1800. To confuse the matter further, the memoirs place Smelt's death after the death of William, duke of Gloucester (in 1805), and an attack of insanity suffered by George III (presumably that same year). It was Smelt who began raising a subscription to provide funds for Boruwlaski's retirement. Boruwlaski, in the meantime, travelled to London, intending to emigrate to America. He was dissuaded from doing so by Margaret Metcalfe and her sisters, who began their own fund for Boruwlaski's retirement; the sums collected in the north and in London were joined so that he was able to buy an annuity. In 1812 he retired to Banks Cottage, South Bailey, Durham, where he lived with the daughters of Thomas Ebdon and paid 2<i>s</i>. annual rent to the dean and chapter. The house is illustrated in the 1820 edition of the memoirs.<br>
<br>The annuity, yielding &pound;138 annually, was invested with a local shopkeeper who expected his early demise. Boruwlaski, however, enjoyed excellent health. He enjoyed teasing the shopkeeper, an elderly man many years his junior, asking him how he was, and adding that his own health could not be better. He told his friend the actor Charles Mathews (as related by Mathews's wife, Anne):<blockquote>Oh <i>poor devel</i>, poor <i>hold</i> body. It <i>macks</i> me <i>laffing</i>, poor <i>hold hanimal</i>. Oh, he say prayer for me to die, offen when he <i>slip</i>. He <i>calcoolated dat</i> dwarf, not live it long <i>et</i> I live it forty year to <i>plag</i> him &hellip; He fifty year <i>younger den</i> <i>Boruwlaski</i><i>; minitime</i> he dead sooner as me &hellip; Boruwlaski NEVER die, you may depend. (Mathews, 3.224&#150;5)</blockquote>The shopkeeper died first, leaving his heirs to continue payments.Boruwlaski became an honorary member of the Marquis of Granby lodge of freemasons in Durham in 1806, but attended only three times. Another member was the actor Stephen Kemble. The huge Kemble and tiny Boruwlaski became fast friends and were a familiar sight walking on the river banks.<br>
<br>In Durham, Boruwlaski elaborated the earlier text of his memoirs, continuing it to his staying with the Ebdons. The new text was edited by another benefactor, the writer and colliery owner William Burdon, who died before its publication in 1820. This version of the memoirs is the most obviously anecdotal, adding a number of extraordinary travellers' tales to the 1788 text, and reducing the prominence of Izalina, but also placing less emphasis on Boruwlaski's friendships with the higher nobility, instead thanking his lasting, less socially exalted admirers.<br>
<br>Visiting London in July 1821, he wished to call on George IV to present his new book. Although it was the eve of the coronation, Mathews secured an interview. The king greeted him warmly and asked about his wife. Boruwlaski replied: &#145;Isolina [<i>sic</i>] die thirty year. Fine woman! Sweet, beauty body! You have no <i>idea</i>, Majesty&#146;  (Mathews, 3.219). The king gave him a watch and chain, accepting the book as a souvenir, and interrogated both Boruwlaski and Mathews about Boruwlaski's financial well-being. Mrs Mathews reported that George IV said: &#145;If I had a dozen sons I could not point out to them a more perfect model of good breeding and elegance than the Count, who really is a most accomplished and charming person!&#146;  (ibid., 3.222).<br>
<br>Until the year before his death Boruwlaski visited London annually to stay with the Mathews and other friends. The journalist Peter George Patmore saw him at Mathews's house in 1823, reporting that at eighty-four &#145;he played in the house and the garden like a nice puppy or a happy child, gay as a bird&#146;  (Mathews, 3.231). He was dignified, however, with strangers.<br>
<br>In the 1830s Boruwlaski became increasingly frail and had to be carried to some of his many social engagements. He continued to correspond with friends such as Caroline Hutton, to whom he wrote in 1833:<blockquote>
<div>Poland was my cradle,<br>
</div>
<div>England was my nest,<br>
</div>
<div>Durham is my quiet place,<br>
</div>
<div>Where my weary bones shall rest.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He died on 5 September 1837 at his home, Banks Cottage, South Bailey, Durham, and was buried near the north tower stair door of Durham Cathedral, at a spot marked by the initials &#145;J. B.&#146;. Canon Ebdon, Thomas Ebdon's nephew, composed an inscription to which the dean and chapter objected; but it appears on a marble wall slab within the west end of St Mary-the-Less where Canon James Raine, Boruwlaski's friend, was rector.<br>
<br>Boruwlaski was said to have retained the cheerfulness, serenity of temper, and even playfulness, of early youth. He was abstemious, never touched alcohol, had perfect sight, and spent much of his time reading, writing, studying alchemy, and conducting scientific experiments. He was commemorated in Durham by a permanent display of his garments at the town hall, and by the name &#145;Count's House&#146; given to the folly with a Doric portico erected on a bend of the River Wear, probably designed by Ignatius Bonomi. In death as in life his reputation depended on curiosity towards his physical condition, and both amusement with and respect for his hard-won and carefully maintained dignity.<br>
