<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mahony,  Francis Sylvester</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Father Prout]</span>  (1804&#150;1866), <span class="occ">satiric poet and journalist</span>, was born at Cork on 31 December 1804, the second son of Mary Reynolds and Martin Mahony (1763/4&#150;1834), a woollen manufacturer who owned and operated a mill near the town. Francis Mahony claimed descent from an old Irish family, the O'Mahonies of Dromore Castle, co. Kerry. With his brother Nicholas, he attended the Jesuits' college at Clongowes Wood, co. Kildare from 1815 to 1819, when they entered the Jesuits' college of St Acheul at Amiens. Determining to become a Jesuit, in spite of his father's desire that he should study law, Francis was soon transferred to the seminary in the rue de S&egrave;vres in Paris, and having spent two years of his noviciate there, he proceeded to the Jesuits' college at Rome to study philosophy (1823&#150;5). A gift for written and spoken Latin attracted the notice of his teachers, but an impatience with discipline made others question his vocation. The Abb&eacute; Martial Marest de la Roch&eacute;-Arnaud, who seems to have met Mahony at Rome, credited him, on the other hand, in his work <span class="italic">Les J&eacute;suites modernes</span> (1826), with all &#145;the fanaticism, the dissimulation, the intrigue, and the chicanery&#146; deemed by him to be Jesuitical characteristics.<br>
<br>In August 1830 Mahony was appointed prefect of studies at the Jesuits' college at Clongowes Wood, and in October he was promoted to be master of rhetoric. His pupils included John Sheehan, a popular journalist who wrote under the pseudonym of the Irish Whisky-Drinker, and Francis Stack (afterwards Serjeant) Murphy. In November Mahony went on a trip to Maynooth with his seminarians. They stopped at Sheehan's family home at Celbridge, and Mahony offended the parish priest, Daniel Callinan, with criticism of Daniel O'Connell (whom Mahony was later to pillory in an essay as &#145;Dandeleon&#146;). A night of drinking with his students led to Mahony's resignation as prefect. After a short stay at the Jesuits' college at Freiburg he went to Florence where he was informed by the provincial of the Jesuits that his association with the order was at an end. Although deeply affected, Mahony showed no animosity against his former colleagues, whom he subsequently defended from conventional accusations in an essay called &#145;Literature and the Jesuits&#146;  (Prout, <span class="italic">Reliques</span>).<br>
<br>No longer a Jesuit, Mahony sought to become a secular priest. For two years he attended theological lectures at Rome, and was ordained at Lucca in 1832. In that year he joined the Cork mission, and displayed courage and devotion as chaplain to a hospital in Cork during the cholera epidemic. Anxious to see the construction of a new church, to be administered by himself, he argued with his bishop over funding and other matters, and left Cork and went to London, soon after this abandoning the active exercise of his profession. On a few occasions he preached and conducted mass in the Spanish ambassador's chapel, but his tone of thought and conversation was unclerical. His interests were mainly literary, and, befriended by William Maginn, he readily adopted the bohemian mode of life, including frequent nights of drinking, which then characterized London literary society.<br>
<br>In April 1834 Mahony sent to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> an article entitled &#145;Father Prout's Apology for Lent, his Death Obsequies, and an Elegy&#146;. A real Father Prout, parish priest at Watergrasshill, co. Cork, called by Mahony's brother Nicholas &#145;a man of quiet, simple manners&#146;  (Jerrold, 91) was well known to Mahony in his boyhood, and had died in 1830. But Mahony's Father Prout, although also located at Watergrasshill, was a creation of Mahony's imagination, suggested to some extent by Goldsmith's &#145;Vicar&#146;, and described by Mahony as the child of Jonathan Swift and Stella. For two years (1834&#150;6) Mahony regularly contributed his &#145;Reliques of Father Prout&#146;, accounts of fictitious episodes in Prout's career, with his views on life and literature. In entertaining comments on current literature, Mahony, following the example of Christopher North (the pseudonym of John Wilson) of <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, introduced Sir Walter Scott in conversation with Father Prout and his friends, defended Harriet Martineau from her critics, and explained his contempt for Bulwer-Lytton. He also freely interspersed the papers with his original poems and playful translations into Latin, Greek, French, and English verse. In a paper called <span class="italic">The Rogueries of Tom Moore</span> Mahony rendered some of Moore's best-known verses into Latin or French, and then wittily charged Moore with plagiarism. His serious translations into English verse, from Horace, B&eacute;ranger, and Victor Hugo, for instance, are less pleasing. Here he often degenerates into a wordy jingle, which does injustice to his originals, and in his own lyrics, of which &#145;The Shandon Bells&#146; is the best-known example, the same defect is apparent. The brilliance of the papers, however, secured a wide reputation for their author; Mahony even signed his name for strangers &#145;Prout Mahony&#146;. He regularly attended the meetings, at taverns or clubs, of the &#145;Fraserians&#146;, the contributors to the magazine, and he came to know many distinguished men of letters of the day. In 1836 he collected the <span class="italic">Reliques</span>, under the name of a fictitious editor, Oliver Yorke, with illustrations by Maclise.<br>
<br>In 1837 Mahony switched from <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> to the new <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, with Charles Dickens as editor, and on the first page of the first number Mahony's poem &#145;The Bottle of St Januarius&#146; appeared. To the same number he contributed a French rendering of Wolfe's &#145;Burial of Sir John Moore&#146;, which he entitled &#145;Les fun&eacute;railles de Beaumanoir&#146;, and pretended to regard as the original of Wolfe's poem. Mahony's English parody of Chatterton, with translations into both Pindaric and Horatian verse, also appeared in this issue. Some seventeen or eighteen poems followed in succeeding numbers. Although Mahony enjoyed the convivial society which he found in the literary clubs of London, at Lady Blessington's house at Kensington, and especially with his friend Thackeray, he was always of restless and uncertain temper. Towards the close of 1837 he abandoned London. In January 1838 &#145;A Poetical Epistle from Father Prout to &#147;Boz&#148;&#146; appeared in <span class="italic">Bentley's</span>, sent from Genoa. After that date he made a long tour through Hungary, Greece, and Asia Minor, and only reached the south of France on his return journey in 1841. From Bordeaux he sent further verse to <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, and in 1842 he took the publisher's part in the dispute between Bentley and Harrison Ainsworth. Despite his previous friendly relations with Ainsworth, Mahony now attacked him in a mock-heroic poem entitled &#145;The Cruel Murder of Old Father Prout by a Barber's Apprentice: a Legend of Modern Latherature, by Mr Duller of Pewternose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, 1842, 11.144). This attack earned scorn for Mahony when he printed in his notes excerpts from private letters by Ainsworth asking Mahony to &#145;puff&#146; his fiction.<br>
<br>After a short sojourn in London and a visit to Malta, in 1846 Mahony set out for Rome to act as correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. His contributions ceased at the end of 1847, and he published them in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Facts and Figures from Italy</span>, under the pseudonym of Don Jeremy Savonarola, Benedictine monk, and addressed to Dickens as an &#145;appendix&#146; to his <span class="italic">Pictures from Italy</span>, as Dickens had originally commissioned Mahony to write for the paper, in his brief period as editor. The conservatism which had characterized his papers in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> was here exchanged for liberalism, and he declared himself in full sympathy with the Italian patriots, and with new movements in the church and the papacy. Mahony was well known to English visitors in Rome, and frequently attended Mrs Jameson's Sunday evening parties; he also became friendly with the Brownings, and visited them in Florence.<br>
<br>About 1848 Mahony returned to London from Rome, and spent time there and in Paris, where he settled in the early 1850s. Except for rare visits to England, he remained in Paris until his death, living in an <i>entresol</i> in a hotel in the rue des Moulins. He was long a familiar figure in Galignani's reading-room in Paris, where many travelling English literati recorded his increasingly eccentric manners. William Allingham was taken by Thackeray to visit him in his room, where they found him &#145;loosely arrayed, reclining in front of a book and a bottle of Burgundy&#146;  (<span class="italic">William Allingham</span>, 77). Mahony's moods apparently varied; while there are reports of rudeness and unsociability, others found an amusing and unique cicerone to the sights of Paris. He is described in his best days as a brilliant, witty talker. Mahony owned some shares in <span class="italic">The Globe</span> newspaper, and in 1858 he became Paris correspondent to the journal, continuing his daily contributions until within a fortnight of his death. He contributed an inaugural ode to the first number of <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, in January 1860, and he was also an occasional writer in the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>.<br>
<br>Mahony became somewhat more religious later in life, and in 1863 he drew up, in scholarly Latin, a petition to Rome asking permission &#145;to resort thenceforth to lay communion&#146;. The petition was granted, together with a dispensation enabling him, in consideration of failing eyesight and advancing age, to substitute the rosary or the penitential psalms for his daily office in the breviary. He died in Paris in the rue des Moulins of bronchitis and diabetes on 18 May 1866, after receiving extreme unction from his friend Monsignor Rogerson. His sister, Mrs Woodlock, was present during his last illness, and he was buried in the vaults of Shandon church in Cork on 27 May.<br>
<br>Mahony's conversation and works were characterized by a satiric bite. His friend James Hannay described Mahony as &#145;full of all sorts of anecdotes&#146; who retailed gossip &#145;flavoured with droll sarcasm&#146;  (Hannay, 52&#150;3). It was probably from Mahony, for instance, that Browning picked up the inside information about Cardinal Wiseman which found its way into &#145;Bishop Blougram's Apology&#146;. Some of his works, such as the Prout paper on <span class="italic">Dean Swift's Madness</span>, show that he was capable of exploring pathos in an eloquent manner. He himself claimed to be &#145;a rare combination of the Te&iuml;an lyre and the Irish bagpipe; of the Ionian dialect, blending harmoniously with the Cork brogue; an Irish potato seasoned with Attic salt&#146;  (Hannay, 53). The particular mixture of polylingual learning and multicultural topical reference, combined with a sense of fun which in both his prose and verse brought him to the verge of nonsense, bewildered many Victorian readers. The same factors make Mahony's works largely unread now except by a few scholars.<br>
