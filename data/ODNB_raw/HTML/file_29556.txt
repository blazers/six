<span class="headword">Williams,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>William Williams Pantycelyn]</span>  (1717&#150;1791), <span class="occ">religious revivalist and writer</span>, was born early in 1717 at Cefncoed in the parish of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn, Carmarthenshire, the third and only surviving son of the six children born to John Williams (1656&#150;1742), farmer, and his wife, Dorothy Lewis (<i>c</i>.1689&#150;1784). The boy wanted to be a doctor. All that is known about his formal education is that he spent a brief period, when he was already past his twentieth birthday, at the dissenting academy of Llwyn-llwyd near Hay-on-Wye, or possibly at the branch established at Chancefield near Talgarth, Brecknockshire.<h2>
<a name="EarlychurchcareerandMethodism"></a>Early church career and Methodism</h2>In Talgarth churchyard, in 1737 or 1738, upon hearing the unlicensed exhorter Howell Harris preach on &#145;the judgement to come&#146;, Williams experienced a decisive religious conversion. The newly enthused young man, who had been brought up in Cefnarthen Independent Church, emulating Harris, became a communicant in the established church and soon decided to seek holy orders. Harris was refused, but Williams succeeded. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of St David's in August 1740 and licensed &#145;to perform the office of curate&#146; at Llanwrtyd and Llanddewi Abergwesyn, two parishes in Brecknockshire in the gift of Theophilus Evans, a clergyman well known in Welsh literary circles for his <span class="italic">Drych y prif oesoedd</span> (1716, 1740). In 1740 Evans published <span class="italic">Llythyr-addysc esgob Llundain</span>, one of Bishop Edmund Gibson's episcopal letters, which contains a polemic against George Whitefield. <span class="italic">The History of Modern Enthusiasm</span>, published in 1752, a more detailed criticism of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century papist and nonconformist heresies, brought Evans further, wider fame. Obviously Evans was not the ideal mentor for a curate regarded by Harris as one of &#145;my Spiritual Children&#146;  (Roberts, 1.36). It became just as obvious that Williams was not an ideal curate. In the summer of 1743 he was accused of absenting himself regularly from his parish duties and of greatly omitting and neglecting the service of his cures. The bishop refused to ordain him priest.<br>
<br>Williams was a Methodist refused. His absences had not been those of a lazy curate but rather the absences of a preacher burning &#145;with Love and Zeal&#146;  (Roberts, 1.52) who devoted much of his time to help Harris and Daniel Rowland, curate of Llangeitho in Cardiganshire, another extraordinary exhorter, to organize the development of the private societies that were being formed in many parts of Wales to care for converts. The growth of these private societies led in 1742 to the formation of a Methodist Association in Wales, and ultimately, of course, to the severance of the Calvinistic Methodists from the Church of England. But throughout Williams's lifetime and for exactly twenty years afterwards Welsh Methodism, although &#145;it was irregular and smacked of Dissent or Enthusiasm&#146;, remained a movement within the church  (Hughes, 3).<br>
<br>As if in anticipation of the ructions Williams would face in the bishop's court in 1743, the association that met at Watford near Caerphilly in April that year resolved &#145;that the Rev<sup>d</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Williams leave his Curacies, &amp; be an Assistant to the Rev<sup>d</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Rowlands&#146;  (Roberts, 1.58). Two things should be noted. First, from the beginning of what was later to be called the great awakening in Wales hundreds of converts thronged to Llangeitho on one Sunday every month to hear Rowland preach and to receive holy communion. Llangeitho became the Welsh Methodists' Mecca, and Rowland needed an assistant to cope with them. Second, following John Williams's death in 1742, his widow and their children moved from Cefncoed to Pantycelyn, her family home, which had been passed on to her on the death of her brother in 1731. William, the only son, came to inherit both farms. His was now a comparatively prosperous little estate; and although not rich he thenceforth lived in comfort and could afford to lead the kind of unfettered life that the Methodist cause demanded of some of its exhorters and counsellors.<br>
<br>From January 1743 Williams was also responsible for superintending the private societies of Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire. He undertook regular preaching tours in south Wales and went on extended tours of north Wales in 1742, 1744, and again in 1748. His letters from this period and his reports on the societies richly testify to the sensitivity and analytic maturity with which he approached the delicate task of caring for converts, the majority of whom were youngsters like himself, at once excited and traumatized by their religious experiences. One of his hearers in 1744 described him as &#145;a very warm, serious, and devout young man, intent upon doing good&#146;, but a young man who &#145;wants to give himself to read and study&#146;  (Roberts, 1.71). A year later Williams discovered Jonathan Edwards's book &#145;on the work of God in New England the best book I have seen to that purpose&#146;  (Roberts, 1.85). He was already turning his mind towards literature. His missionary zeal, his pastoral concern for his flocks, his interest in understanding their needs, and his obvious desire to enlighten and comfort them through literary descriptions of their conditions marked him as the most special of Harris's and Rowland's lieutenants.<br>
<br>Before long Williams would reluctantly have to choose between Harris and Rowland. From 1745 onwards Harris and Rowland were constantly in debate or bickering: theological differences divided them; they were jealous of each other's claim to the leadership of Welsh Methodism; Harris, the general superintendent of the work in Wales, was envious of Llangeitho's popularity; at the same time Rowland rued Harris's absences in London, and, in one famous case, the company he kept. In 1750 the growing rift between them was seen to be irreparable. To exacerbate things, Harris retreated to his native Trefeca Fach to establish a sort of commune. Soon the Methodists became Harris's People and Rowland's People. Williams had little choice but to support Rowland. Generally the 1750s were a debilitating decade for them, but they were the making of Williams&#151;of Williams Pantycelyn (as he became known) as an author of great vision, brilliance, and pertinence. With Harris gone the Methodist revival in Wales lost its impetus and there were far fewer demands on its leaders' time. Williams devoted himself not only &#145;to read and study&#146; (as Thomas Morgan of Henllan had suggested he should) but also to write, prolifically.<h2>
<a name="Earlyworksandmarriage"></a>Early works and marriage</h2>Williams had already published a small collection of hymns in 1744. This was <span class="italic">Aleluia</span>, a collection he added to regularly until 1749. Following the example of English and Welsh writers of an earlier generation and now following Isaac Watts and more recently Charles Wesley, several Welsh Methodists had attempted to express in verse the essential zeal and individual sense of salvation and intimacy with Christ that characterized the revival, but no one had done so successfully. From the outset Williams wrote with that confidence about content and conviction of style that rang true to his purpose. Although most of the early hymns do not have the imaginative range and verbal power of the poetry he wrote twenty years later, his matter and his idiom were already established. He succeeded remarkably in bringing together theology and personal experience and in fusing the classic Welsh of William Morgan's <span class="roman">Bible</span> to his north Carmarthenshire dialect. <span class="italic">Aleluia</span> was followed by <span class="italic">Hosanna i fab Dafydd</span> (1751&#150;4) and by <span class="italic">Rhai hymnau newyddion</span> (1757).<br>
<br>Pantycelyn was now home to a wife, too. In 1748, or perhaps in 1747&#151;the parish register has no record of the marriage&#151;Williams married Mary (1723&#150;1799), the only daughter of Thomas Francis, a prosperous farmer of Llansawel, Carmarthenshire. It is said of her that like her husband she had been &#145;called to religion when she was about twenty years of age&#146;, that she was wise, attractive, tender, and an excellent singer whose company he sought on many a preaching tour: her singing sometimes stilled the wrath of enemies  (Roberts, 1.97). As an addendum to an elegy that he wrote on the death of a three-week-old daughter in 1758, Williams wrote a heart-warming verse about his love for Mary. He was a kindly man; but we know from contemporary descriptions that, like the proverbial blond-redhead, he was quick-tempered, sometimes impatient and touchy. On the other hand, he enjoyed the banter of witty company, making impromptu verse for entertainment's sake, and selling tea, and was generally as well liked as he was highly revered.<br>
<br>The maturing hymnist from 1750 onwards acquired through study a working knowledge of religious history that gave perspective to the awakening with which he was involved and a theological framework for his thoughts and imaginings. Perhaps the key to his substantial literary achievement is that he was a curious, in some ways rapacious, scholar, a thoroughly conscientious and (again) curious carer of souls, and that he was at the same time, artistically, a poet with a genius for adapting scriptural imagery and defining theological concepts in verse that encapsulated the real and ideal experiences of a readership that he knew intimately. Williams was in so many ways a pioneering artist.<br>
<br>That said, it must also be said that eighteenth-century Methodism owed much to seventeenth-century puritanism and that Williams's eighteenth-century mind owed a lot to seventeenth-century divines, scientists, and other authors. His first major work after the Harris&#150;Rowland rift was <span class="italic">Golwg ar deyrnas Crist</span> (1756), a long poem of five and a half thousand lines that has its roots in late seventeenth-century debates on deism and that borrows much of its material from works by William Derham and James Hervey. Its five parts deal with the five stages of God's universal design, the covenant, creation, Christ's coming, the body of Christ (the church), and his fulfilment. The poem includes a noted celebration of creation. It is nevertheless a poem that puts creation in context, a poem that in the age of reason reaffirms Christ's suprascientific role as eternal redeemer.<h2>
<a name="ThesecondLlangeithorevivalandlaterworks"></a>The second Llangeitho revival and later works</h2>The year 1762 saw the second Llangeitho revival (as it is called), an awakening in 1762 as fervent as that of the first revival of the late 1730s and early 1740s. In Robert Jones's <span class="italic">Drych yr amseroedd</span> (1820) it is reported that its cause was the publication of Williams's new collection of hymns <span class="italic">Caniadau (y rhai sydd ar y m&ocirc;r o wydr)</span> (1762), but of course something must have brought people together to buy and then to sing them. Harris had returned&#151;Williams and Peter Williams had been seeking reconciliation with him since at least 1759&#151;and the revivalists superintended the societies as before; but Harris's contribution was now not great. Rowland left his living and built Gwynfil Chapel to receive the converts in Llangeitho: in middle age he preached as powerfully as he had done in youth. As for Williams, he continued to visit societies, to go on preaching tours, to attend association meetings. The records are patchy, but we know that he was (for instance) in Fishguard in 1770, near Pont-rhyd-y-fen in 1771, in Woodstock in 1778, in Neath in 1780. In one of his last letters he reckoned that he had travelled 111,800 miles in the Methodist cause, &#145;four times the world's circumference&#146;  (Roberts, 1.164). For several years from 1765 he was in theological debate against Sandemanism. Throughout the 1770s he enjoyed celebrating the anniversary of the college established at Trefeca by Lady Huntingdon. And he was able to welcome to the leadership younger men of talent and devotion, most notably Thomas Charles.<br>
<br>However, Williams's major and overriding contribution from 1762 onwards was his contribution as poet and prose writer. His later biography is his literary biography. During the last twenty-eight years of his life he wrote with such order, purpose, variety, and brilliance so as to provide his immediate audience with a comprehensive literature that formed as it informed the Welsh Methodist mind and the Welsh Methodist imagination. His writing gave modern Welsh literature generally a new direction. Gomer Roberts in <span class="italic">Y p&ecirc;r ganiedydd I</span>  (p. 148) calls the years between 1768 and 1786 &#145;nawnddydd tawel&#146; (&#145;quiet, or peaceful, afternoon&#146;). Williams's paper supplier, like his publisher, would disagree with that description.<br>
<br>The epistolary <span class="italic">Llythyr Martha Philopur</span> (1762) and <span class="italic">Atteb Philo-Evangelius</span> (1763) were the first literary fruits of the 1762 revival, and were followed by <span class="italic">Bywyd a marwolaeth Theomemphus</span> (1764). Martha Philopur is the quintessentially sensitive convert, Philo-Evangelius the quintessential counsellor. They are models of Methodism. Theomemphus is no model. The poem describes the inner life of an arch-sinner who personifies &#145;all the sins of nature and every wrong reported throughout Scripture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theomemphus</span>, 6). Unfortunately, Williams adopts the same rather monotonous verse form as in <span class="italic">Golwg ar deyrnas Crist</span>, but whereas so much of the material there was traditional and inherited, and the method descriptive, the material in <span class="italic">Bywyd a marwolaeth Theomemphus</span> is originally, vividly Methodist, and the method dramatic. Theomemphus is put through several kinds of crises, theological, moral, spiritual, sexual; but in the end the supernaturally hounded anti-hero is brought to rest in God's salvation.<br>
<br>Theomemphus is Williams's most stupendous creation. The author states in the introduction to the poem that nothing in his own experiences or in the experiences of the people he had interrogated in twenty-four years in various private societies had been of assistance in creating him. This implies that most if not all of his other characters and characterizations are based on reality or at least on real-life aspects. These include the depersonalized subjects of <span class="italic">Tri w&#375;r o Sodom a'r Aipht</span> (1768), Afaritus, Prodigalus, and Fidelius, only the last of whom is a model for good. His other models are the two score subjects of his elegies. But some of his elegies are more than model makers. A few, notably <span class="italic">Marwnad er coffadwriaeth Mr. Howel Harries</span> (1773), are literary historical landmarks.<br>
<br>Another book from this period, <span class="italic">Aurora Borealis</span> (1773), in part a description of the northern lights, demonstrates Williams's continuing interest in the natural and physical sciences. His two most profound prose works were published in 1777, and both are sustained analytical studies. The one, <span class="italic">Templum experientiae apertum, neu, Ddrws y society profiad</span>, is a series of dialogues on the essence, nature, and efficacy of the private society as confessional and spiritual academy. The other, <span class="italic">Ductor nuptiarum, neu, Gyfarwyddwr priodas</span>, is a treatment of contemporary behaviour in relation to the courtship and marriages of those who profess religion. Both books, often witty, sometimes satirical, thoroughly captivating, again testify to Williams's extraordinary understanding of human nature and of the effects of religious conviction on that nature. Theomemphus's imaginary guide and confidant is a character called Dr Aletheius. In at least five of his seven original prose books Williams is Welsh Methodism's Dr Aletheius. He also sought to be a teacher&#150;doctor to the Welsh Methodists. Between 1762 and 1778 or 1779 he compiled and published in seven parts <span class="italic">Pantheologia</span>, ostensibly a history of world religions that includes geographical, historical, natural, and other descriptions of all parts of the globe. Of all his publications this was the least popular with his readers.<br>
<br>Williams's most popular works were, and are, his hymns, of which he published nearly a thousand. The first three collections, discussed above, contain some excellent compositions, but in the main they are eclipsed by the wonderful hymns he published in three other collections published in the 1760s and 1770s. These are <span class="italic">Caniadau (y rhai sydd ar y m&ocirc;r o wydr)</span> (1762), <span class="italic">Ffarwel weledig, groesaw anweledig bethau</span> published in three parts (1763, 1766, 1769), and the two-part <span class="italic">Gloria in excelsis</span> (1771, 1772). All these contain hymns that are lyric poems of the first rank, powerful individual songs and powerful, sustained sequences. Like all good hymns they praise the Lord, they contrast the sinner's weaknesses with Christ's constancy and love, and they give expression to some of the central Christian teachings. But like no other writer of poetry in the Welsh language before him, Williams in these hymns expresses the pain and ecstasy of personal religious experience with the bravado of a poet who is conscious of his own originality but who at the same time continues to recognize (and revel in) his adherence to scriptural imagery and scriptural idiom. In that way he is vibrantly novel and splendidly classic. In the hymns above all, but in his long poems and prose works too, Williams's contribution is such that one can claim with certainty that if he had not written, Welsh Methodism would not have found literary expression.<br>
<br>In a letter to Thomas Charles of 14 October 1787 Williams notes that &#145;we [his generation of Methodist preachers] are galloping out of this wor[l]d in the greatest hast&#146;  (Roberts, 1.161). Although past seventy he continued to write hymns, meditations, translations, and he still conducted preaching tours; as late as March 1790 he reports on &#145;a long journey through Caermarthenshire, Glamorganshire, Monmouthshire, and Breconshire, being about 250 miles&#146;  (Roberts, 1.163). Later in 1790 he was too ill to attend the association at Bala. He died at Pantycelyn on 11 January 1791 and was buried in Llanfair-ar-y-bryn churchyard. Mary survived him, as did seven of the eight children born to them.<br>
