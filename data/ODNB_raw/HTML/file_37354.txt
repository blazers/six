<span class="headword">Dering, Sir  Edward</span>, second baronet  (1625&#150;1684), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 November 1625 at Surrenden Dering, Kent, and baptized on 8 December at Pluckley in the same county, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7531/', "Sir Edward Dering, first baronet (1598&#150;1644)")</script>, antiquary and religious controversialist, of Surrenden Dering, and his second wife, Anne (1604/5&#150;1628), daughter of Sir John Ashburnham. He was educated at schools in Kent and London, and at Sidney Sussex College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge; he entered the Middle Temple in 1641. Dering joined his father with the king at the raising of the royal standard in Nottingham, but returned to Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1643. He planned to continue his studies at Leiden, where he learned of the death of his father and thus succeeded to his title in 1644, but after two more years' travelling in France and the Netherlands he returned to England and an estate encumbered by debts and a dispute with his stepmother, Unton.<br>
<br>On 5 April 1648 Dering married Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1629, <i>d</i>. 1704) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61860/', "Dering, Mary, Lady Dering")</script>], daughter of Daniel Harvey, a wealthy Turkey merchant; another of Harvey's daughters married Heneage Finch, the lawyer, and for a time all four seem to have lived together at the mother-in-law's home in Lambeth. During the 1650s Dering seems deliberately to have sought obscurity while pursuing literary interests, in part as a member of the circle of Katherine Philips. But having, in his own words, &#145;most carefully and resolutely refused during all the time of the usurped powers all manner of public employments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 110), on the eve of the Restoration he became a militia commissioner in Kent and secured election as knight for the shire to the Convention Parliament.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Heneage Finch became solicitor-general, and Dering profited from the connection. In July 1662 he was appointed as one of seven commissioners to execute the <span class="roman">Act for the Settlement of Ireland</span>. He was returned to the Irish House of Commons that year for Lismore. The activities of the commission in sorting out land rights after the various forfeitures of the previous two decades brought opportunities both to please the powerful and for personal gain. Dering was regarded as one of the commissioners closest to the English court; in 1667 he was sworn of the Irish privy council. His work under the commission, and under a second court of claims appointed under the 1665 <span class="roman">Act of Explanation</span>, occupied him until 1669, when the court's work was complete. Soon after his return to England he was made one of the three commissioners of the privy seal and in 1670 he was returned to parliament for East Retford in Nottinghamshire. The appointment of Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey, as lord privy seal in 1673 superseded the commission and was a setback for Dering's finances. Yet the appointment of Sir Thomas Osborne (later earl of Danby) as lord treasurer, and Heneage Finch as lord keeper the same year helped to draw him into the inner circle of the court's system of parliamentary management, and to secure for him (eventually) a pension to compensate for his loss of office. By 1675 Dering was acting regularly in the Commons as a court spokesman, particularly in the debates on supply in October&#150;November 1675 and in Danby's bill of 1677 for bringing up the children of the duke of York as protestants. In December 1675 he was appointed one of the commissioners of the customs: two years later he was also made a commissioner to inquire into abuses in the Royal Mint. His parliamentary role continued to grow: in early 1678 he chaired committees of the whole house on supply and on ways and means.<br>
<br>Following the emergence of the Popish Plot allegations and the dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament at the end of 1678 Dering found his court role more difficult. He was elected in 1679 and 1681 for the local Kentish borough of Hythe, and shortly after the beginning of the 1679 parliament, in March, was appointed one of the five commissioners who replaced Danby at the Treasury. Dering sought awkwardly to articulate a middle position: he urged the unity of protestants in the face of the popish threat and promoted measures for the removal of penalties from protestant nonconformists, but he voted against the exclusion of the duke of York from the throne. Towards the end of the parliament of 1680&#150;81, perhaps shaken by an absurd accusation of popery from Israel Tonge, he signalled his acceptance of exclusion. He suffered little royal displeasure for it. An uncomfortable interview with the king in August 1681 concerning the activities and whiggish opinions of his eldest son may have been an oblique indication of disapproval, but Dering retained his office in the Treasury and was encouraged by the king to work up proposals for a new form of the Irish revenue, although these were ultimately abandoned after Dering expended enormous effort on them.<br>
<br>Dering died in London, probably in his house in Gerard Street, on 24 June 1684. He was buried at Pluckley four days later. He had inherited from his antiquary father not only an interest in religious controversy, but also an inveterate habit of note taking: he compiled detailed notes and diaries of proceedings at the court of claims, in parliament, and before the Treasury commission. He was survived by his wife, with whom he had eight sons (of whom four died in infancy) and nine daughters (three of whom did not survive childhood).<br>
