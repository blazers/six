<span class="headword">Boswell,  James</span>  (1778&#150;1822), <span class="occ">barrister and literary scholar</span>, was born on 15 September 1778 at James's Court, Edinburgh. He was the fourth child and second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2950/', "James Boswell (1740&#150;1795)")</script> of Auchinleck, advocate, diarist, and biographer of Samuel Johnson, and his wife, Margaret [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65003/', "Boswell, Margaret Montgomerie (1738?&#150;1789)")</script>], daughter of David Montgomerie, originally Laing (<i>d</i>. 1752), of Lainshaw, Ayrshire, and his wife, Veronica Boswell (sister of Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck). After the family's move to London in 1786, his father, eager for him to have an English education and intending him for the bar, enrolled him in an academy in Soho Square kept by Dr William Barrow, later archdeacon of Nottingham, and sent him to Westminster School in 1790. The elder Boswell's diaries and letters, in which the younger Boswell appears as Jamie, testify to a deep reciprocated affection between father and son, who as a boy consoled his father in his frequent despondencies and frustrations and urged him to take pride in his literary achievements and eminent social circle. He attended his father on his deathbed, and the last letter from the biographer to his closest friend, William Johnson Temple, was dictated to his son.<br>
<br>Raised in his father's circles of friendship, the younger Boswell showed literary aptitudes early, and among his surviving juvenilia are numerous unpublished plays, squibs, poems, and comic operas&#151;including &#145;The siege of Carthage&#146;, in five acts, written when he was ten. His adult correspondence shows continuing cordiality with such figures as the Corsican general Pasquale Paoli, John Courtenay MP, Bennet Langton, his father's publisher Charles Dilly, and in particular Edmond Malone, who became a guardian, mentor, and virtually a second father. Malone wrote of him in 1796, &#145;He grows every day very like his father, but will not have his vivacity or wit; on the other hand he will be more studious and more steady&#146;  (Buchanan, 8). The elder Boswell, in a codicil to his will, had given Malone charge of the <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> (first published 1791), to which Malone, with help from the younger Boswell, added new material and brought out its third (1799), fourth (1804), fifth (1807), and sixth (1811) editions. Boswell went to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1797, and was admitted to the Inner Temple in January 1799. While still a student at Brasenose, he contributed notes to the third edition and further notes to the sixth, the entire text of which he read and corrected. He was awarded the degrees of BA (1801), and MA (1806), and was made a Vinerian fellow in 1812. He was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1805, acted as counsel on the home circuit and Surrey sessions, and was appointed a commissioner of bankrupts, but chose also to pursue his scholarly interests, largely under Malone's direction. His father's executors entrusted to him the decision as to whether the biographer's mass of private papers warranted publication, and when he came of age, he concurred with the executors' general opinion that it did not; the appearance in print of the elder Boswell's journals had to await the twentieth-century rediscoveries at Malahide and Fettercairn.<br>
<br>Boswell joined the Albemarle Street circle of the publisher John Murray, and was elected a member of the Roxburghe Club at its first anniversary dinner in 1813. He wrote a memoir of Malone for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of June 1813, which he reprinted the next year for private circulation. Malone had assigned him work in collecting materials for his vast revised edition of Shakespeare, which at Malone's request Boswell completed and brought out in twenty-one volumes in 1821, nine years after Malone's death. For this edition, commonly referred to as Boswell&#150;Malone or the &#145;third variorum&#146;, Boswell contributed notes, a long preliminary advertisement, a completion of Malone's &#145;Essay on the phraseology and metre of Shakespeare and his contemporaries&#146;, and a &#145;glossarial index&#146;, and reprinted his memoir of Malone. The second volume contained Malone's important biography of Shakespeare, assembled by Boswell from materials left in fragmentary form at the time of the editor's death. &#145;That Malone's life of Shakespeare is available to us in any form we owe to Boswell. He coped heroically with an impossible task&#146;  (Schoenbaum, 176).<br>
<br>Boswell died suddenly on 24 February 1822, after a short illness described in a letter by his uncle as an &#145;inflammatory sore throat&#146;, in his rooms at 3 Garden Court, Middle Temple  (T. D. Boswell to William Boswell, 25 Feb 1822, Boswell MS C542.7). He had never married. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2947/', "Sir Alexander Boswell")</script>, travelled to London to settle his affairs, only a short time before his own death from a gunshot wound in a duel, after which in Sir Alexander's pocket book was found his poem to James's memory which concluded, &#145;He never lost one friend, nor found one foe&#146;.<br>
<br>The Boswell&#150;Malone edition of Shakespeare, reprinting significant earlier prefaces and judiciously selecting material for its annotation from editions as early as Pope's, with substantial new contributions from Malone and Boswell and a wide network of friends and informants, marked a notable advance in the development of the modern comprehensive variorum edition, and is cited in twentieth-century editions as an authoritative summation of eighteenth-century Shakespearian editing.<br>
<br>Modern scholarship has shown the nature of Boswell's Shakespeare editing, and the breadth of his interests, to have been under-regarded. Malone&#150;Boswell, on its appearance, &#145;was easily the most complete and valuable edition of Shakespeare yet to be published&#146;  (Sherbo, <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Midwives</span>, 154), and Boswell's careful, firm but tactful, and wide-ranging contributions&#151;far more than simply bringing Malone's work to completion&#151;point clearly to his sophisticated classical and antiquarian scholarship, in particular a thorough knowledge of early English dramatic and non-dramatic literature, and his informed sensitivity to both textual and critical issues. Volume 20 of the edition contained, unusually for editions of the time, Shakespeare's poems, with several important notes by Boswell attesting to their merit and defending them against disparaging assessments made by earlier commentators. His detailed remarks on the sonnets in particular made &#145;a lasting impression on later scholarship&#146;  (ibid., 179). The sale catalogue of his impressive library, moreover, shows Boswell to have had, among much else, a knowledgeable interest in opera, music, and continental literature, and to have been a capable Hispanist, and indicates the depth and range of his intellectual and collecting interests, as well as the breadth of his acquaintance with books, both old and current, and eminent literary people.<br>
