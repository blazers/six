<span class="headword">Violet,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1662/3), <span class="occ">goldsmith and writer on trade</span>, registered his earliest goldsmith's mark in 1627 and came to the notice of James I when Sir Edward Coke, then secretary to the privy council, found that he had been playing the money market by exchanging English silver coin for French gold. Violet professed surprise at being thus &#145;discovered&#146;, claiming that his activities were well known. He was imprisoned, but as his account books showed that he had made a profit, thereby enriching the country, he was pardoned, the king demanding &pound;2000 as his share of this profit.<br>
<br>At this time there was a considerable traffic in coinage; goldsmiths and refiners were buying up overweight coins, leaving lightweight and clipped coin in circulation. The heavy coins were illegally exported, to circulate freely in France and Germany, or melted down for sale to the gold and silver wire-drawers, with whom Violet was closely connected. After his release Violet turned informer, a task he undertook with gusto, hiring agents at home and abroad to examine the books of merchants and traders, and ships' documents, and bringing numerous cases of alleged illegal export of coin to the Star Chamber. Successful prosecutions brought large fines to the state treasure; these, according to Violet, were subsequently misspent by Cromwell on the parliamentarian armies.<br>
<br>On being pardoned for his own misdeeds, Violet endeavoured to make his peace with the Goldsmiths' Company, of which he was at that time a warden, saying that his accusations were made under duress; at the same time, he paid &pound;1500 for the post of surveyor to the gold and silver wire-drawers. His duties were to inspect the wire which was made up into braids and lace for the extensive luxury trade, and he instituted a system of assaying each skein and sealing it with the craftsman's mark. He found that much of this wire was only a copper core lightly plated. He was empowered to confiscate such substandard wire, and he prosecuted many of the tradesmen involved with a zeal which brought him many enemies, among them Bradbourn, the queen's silk-man, though he wisely dropped proceedings in that case. He also sought to prosecute John Wollaston, a wealthy goldsmith and parliamentarian, who afterwards seized the opportunity to take his revenge on Violet. Between 1635 and 1640 Violet was involved in the attempts to set up the Wyre-drawers' Company, in the face of Goldsmiths' Company opposition.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1643 Violet, an admitted royalist, was recruited by Sir Basil Brooke, a Catholic who was endeavouring to win over the City to Charles's cause. Lord General Essex gave him a parliamentary pass to collect a letter from the king at Oxford for delivery to Wollaston, then lord mayor, and the common council of the City of London. On delivering it Violet was immediately arrested, charged with high treason, and in January 1644 committed to the Tower. His estates in Essex and Shropshire were sequestered, and bonds relating to the Shropshire property were seized from his sister. Officers went to his mother's house and took away various bills and bonds belonging to him, his business papers, and a document wherein the king acknowledged Violet's expenses of &pound;19,068 in respect of the Star Chamber prosecutions.<br>
<br>Violet was closely confined for 928 days without trial, being obliged to borrow at interest &pound;800 for his subsistence; he was not released until 1652, when at some expense he regained possession of some of the confiscated bonds. He did not recover his post as surveyor of gold and silver wire, but, on successfully charging Wollaston with defrauding the king of revenue, was appointed to succeed him as melter at the Royal Mint. Violet later petitioned Richard Cromwell to mint farthing tokens, promising that a part of the profits should go to benefit maimed soldiers, but before this project materialized there was a change of government and all was forgotten. While in prison Violet had begun to set down his ideas for reviving trade. He supposed that the prosperity of certain foreign ports flowed from their equal treatment of merchants and traders of all nations, and their reduction of customs duties, and he urged that free ports should be established in England, which by drawing in cheap and plentiful raw materials, would benefit the working class.<br>
<br>In 1652&#150;3 Violet again investigated illegal transport of coin, accusing the masters of the ships <i>Samson</i>, <i>Salvador</i>, and <i>George</i> of seeking to export silver. He claimed to have borrowed a further &pound;675 to pursue his enquiries and to have refused a bribe from the Spanish ambassador to concede that the silver belonged to various merchants in the Spanish Netherlands, and to drop charges. The owners of the vessels were prosecuted in the court of admiralty and the value of the recovered bullion was over &pound;300,000, but again Violet was unable to recoup his outlay. Over the years, he published numerous letters from himself and his supporters, also tracts, and narratives, seeking to defend himself from accusations of perfidy and to recover his seized assets and outlays, yet continuing to lay accusations against the wire-drawers, goldsmiths, and refiners, and all those who in his view deprived the nation of its rightful wealth by exporting gold and silver.<br>
<br>These attacks inevitably drew responses, the most virulent of which was published anonymously in 1660, entitled <span class="italic">The Great Treppaner of England</span>. Its author said of &#145;Thomas Violet, a name too sweet for so foule a carkass&#146; that<blockquote>his birth was at sea &hellip; ingendred between a poor Dutch Fidler and a Moorish woman. How he came into England without the help of the Devil, or even got into the repute to be intrusted in any man's service as an Apprentice, and to become a member of this famous City of London, I am altogether ignorant.</blockquote>These statements were said to be sworn, but are otherwise unsubstantiated. Certainly Violet's own writings, though prolix and much given to flowery metaphor, are not those of an ill-educated man.<br>
<br>It is not known if Violet was married or what his relationship was with the William Violet mentioned in connection with his sequestered Essex estate. It seems possible that he died in debt, or at least without assets; his nuncupative will was proved in 1663.<br>
