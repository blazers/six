<span class="headword">Towson,  John Thomas</span>  (1804&#150;1881), <span class="occ">scientist and photographer</span>, the son of John Gay Towson (1769&#150;1857) and his wife, Elizabeth Thomas, was born at Fore Street, Devonport, on 8 April 1804, and educated at Stoke classical school. He initially followed his father's trade as a maker of chronometers and watches. When the daguerreotype process was introduced in 1839 he and Robert Hunt (1807&#150;1887) devoted considerable attention to it; it was with the help of Towson's work, published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> (November 1839) and entitled &#145;On the proper focus for the daguerreotype&#146;, that the American John William Draper took the first sunlight picture of a human face in 1840. Towson was the first to devise the means of taking a photographic picture on glass and of using the reflecting camera; and, with Hunt, he produced highly sensitive photographic papers, for the sale of which they appointed agents in London and elsewhere. On 19 November 1840 he married at Stoke Demerel church, Devonport, Margaret, daughter of William Braddon, sailmaker, of Devonport. At this time Towson described himself as &#145;watchmaker&#146;.<br>
<br>About 1846 Towson turned his attention to navigation, in which he instructed young men in the naval yard. His investigations led to the suggestion that the quickest route across the Atlantic would be by sailing on the great circle. Sir John Herschel drew the attention of the Admiralty to Towson's discovery, and that department subsequently published Towson's <span class="italic">Tables for Facilitating the Practice of Great Circle Sailing</span>, and his <span class="italic">Tables for the Reduction of ex-Meridian Altitudes</span> (1849). The works proved of particular value to the merchant marine. In 1850 he moved to Liverpool on being appointed scientific examiner of masters and mates there; he held the post until 1873, when he retired, still holding an appointment as chief examiner in compasses. In 1853 he brought before the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society the subject of the deviation of the compass on board iron ships, and in 1854 he helped William Scoresby (1789&#150;1857) to draw the attention of the British Association to the matter. The result of the discussion was the formation of the Liverpool compass committee, whose three reports, subsequently presented to both houses of parliament, were largely produced by Towson. In recognition of his services to navigation he was on 9 January 1857 presented by the shipowners of Liverpool with a dock bond for &pound;1000 and a gratuity of more than &pound;100. In 1863 he was instructed by the Board of Trade to prepare a manual which was published as <span class="italic">Practical Information on the Deviation of the Compass &hellip; [on] Iron Ships</span>. In 1870 he prepared a syllabus, adopted by the Board of Trade, for examinations in compass deviations. Towson died at his home, 47 Upper Parliament Street, Liverpool, on 3 January 1881, leaving a widow.<br>
<br>Towson wrote prolifically on geography, photography, and history, but it was his works on navigation, which reached several editions and were translated into various languages, for which he is best remembered.<br>
