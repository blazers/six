<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ouseley,  Gideon</span>  (1762&#150;1839), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was the eldest son of John Ouseley (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1735) of Kilticoghly, co. Galway, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Francis Surridge, of Fairyhill, co. Galway. He was born at Dunmore, co. Galway, the residence of his great-uncle William Ouseley, on 24 February 1762. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20956/', "Sir Ralph Ouseley")</script> was his younger brother.<br>
<br>Ouseley was the son of a freethinking, anti-clerical father and a pious mother who introduced him to the family collection of Anglican and puritan literature. Despite his father's anti-clericalism he was bound for a career in the Church of Ireland and was tutored by the local Catholic priest, Father Keane, who had been educated in Europe. Ouseley, having failed to win a place at Trinity College, Dublin, studied with his cousins <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20955/', "Sir Gore Ouseley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20957/', "Sir William Ouseley")</script> under a private tutor, one Dr Robinson. His father inherited a farm in co. Roscommon, to where the family moved in 1781. Shortly after, he married Miss Harriet Wills (1762&#150;1853) of Wills Grove, in 1783. They had no children. The marriage resulted in a small estate being settled on him by her father. However, the estate subsequently had to be surrendered, probably unnecessarily, after a lawsuit. Ouseley then entered a phase of dissolute living, which was dramatically brought to an end by a drunken shooting accident in which he lost an eye and very nearly his life. During his convalescence his wife read to him Edward Young's gloomy <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>, which, in conjunction with his near-death experience, resulted in a lasting preoccupation with death and eternity.<br>
<br>Ouseley's first experience of evangelical religion was in April 1791, at the meetings conducted in a local inn by Methodist quartermaster Robinet, attached to the Royal Irish Dragoons and stationed in Dunmore barracks. Thus began a long and psychologically painful conversion during which Ouseley encountered other Methodist itinerants and joined a local Methodist society. He soon decided to become an itinerant preacher but his work was undertaken as a freelance evangelist because of his suspicion of ecclesiastical institutions and their clergy. In 1797 he and his wife settled in the town of Sligo, and opened a girls' school. However, in 1799 he was invited by the Irish Methodist conference to be part of a team of Irish-speaking evangelists with a specific mission to the Irish Catholic poor in the wake of the rebellion of the United Irishmen.<br>
<br>Ouseley sang and preached, mostly in Irish, to large gatherings of people at county assizes, fairs, market days, funerals, and wakes, in prisons, and outside church services. His early reports for Dr Coke, the director of the Irish mission, capture the flavour of these occasions:<blockquote>On Monday we came to Baillieborough. The market people were assembled when we came into the street. We did not alight, but prepared to attack the devil's kingdom which still remained strong in the town. The Methodists wished us out of the street, when they saw the manner of our proceedings, riding on our horses, with our umbrellas over our heads, the day being wet, but a young girl was so alarmed that she feared the day of judgement was at hand. (Ouseley MSS, CR/6/3/F/10)</blockquote>Ouseley was not only characterized by his evangelical zeal but also by his anti-Catholicism, which predated his evangelical conversion and was part of a wider anti-clericalism. He drew a distinction between priests and the ordinary people, whom he regarded as victims of priestly tyranny and insupportable financial burdens. However, his anti-Catholicism underwent several phases of development and therefore by 1807 Ouseley was much more willing to engage in public controversies against Catholics. The thrust of his attacks also changed. Whereas earlier he had been more concerned with the social consequences of Catholic errors, after 1807 he unleashed a prolific pamphlet attack on Catholic dogma which continued until his death.<br>
<br>During the 1820s Ouseley, apart from his continuing commitment to preaching, spent much of the decade publishing his own highly individualistic solutions to Ireland's miseries. His remedies were for more responsible landlordism, a more equitable and rational assessment of tithes, the state payment of Catholic priests, and an electoral register based on minimum educational standards to ensure that landlords would have to provide schools for those over whom they exerted economic and political influence. He died in Dublin on 14 May 1839 and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin. There is a memorial church to him in Mountmellick, Queen's county, the town in which he preached his last sermon. At the heart of Ouseley's personality and work were a sincere religious faith and a genuine compassion for his country and countrymen. He was one of Ireland's most influential figures in the early nineteenth-century post-rebellion era.<br>
