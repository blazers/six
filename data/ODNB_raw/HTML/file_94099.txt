<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bird,  Walter Leonard Frederick</span>  (1903&#150;1969), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at 141 Southampton Street, Camberwell, London, on 21 June 1903, the elder child and only son of Walter John Bird, letter sorter, and his wife, Charlotte Helena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards. While both his parents hoped their son would become an engineer, Walter chose to study fine art, first at Richmond Art School and then in Paris. He subsequently felt he did not possess a natural flair for painting and decided instead to pursue his interest in photography.<br>
<br>In 1936 Bird joined the Royal Photographic Society, and became an associate the following year. His first studio was at 6 Denman Street, Piccadilly. In the early years of his career he worked primarily on advertising commissions and portraits of actors, including Robert Donat and Yvonne Arnaud, which were published in such society and stage magazines as <span class="italic">Tatler</span> and <span class="italic">Theatre World</span>. However, his 1930s colour figure compositions of artists' models (now housed at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in Bradford) best display his imaginative flair and individuality as a photographer. He employed the Vivex Carbro colour process, developed by D. A. Spencer and favoured by Madame Yevonde for its rich, saturated hues. His images of exotically clad and semi-nude women glow with jewel-like colours, blocks of vibrant reds and greens resonate against each other, and a combination of decorative patterned fabrics, feathers, jewels, and tropical flowers produce glamorous and luxurious effects. Red-lipped models are perfectly poised, appearing as otherworldly creatures of mysterious beauty, and group compositions like <span class="italic">The Roman Bath</span> (<i>c</i>.1938) evoke the classical tableau paintings of artists such as Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. When the Colour Photographs Ltd factory in Willesden, which processed Vivex photographs, closed in 1940 Bird turned to the new colour processes Kodacolor and Kodachrome.<br>
<br>Bird published his early black and white nude studies in two solo books: <span class="italic">Beauty's Daughters</span>, with an introduction by the Italian artist Fortunio Matania (1938), and <span class="italic">Beauty's Self: 48 Photographic Studies by Walter Bird</span> (1941). In addition he collaborated with the photographers John Everard and Roye on the book <span class="italic">Eves without Leaves</span> (1940), which proved popular with British troops during the Second World War.<br>
<br>During his career Bird exhibited in his studio and in London group exhibitions at the RBA Gallery in Pall Mall, the Royal Institute Galleries, and at the annual London Salon. In 1937 he was invited to exhibit at the Chicago Camera Club, showing a colour picture of the actress Stella Moya. As his reputation grew, he moved to a larger studio at 19 Savile Row, which was bombed during the war, destroying the majority of his negatives. He was devastated and left London for Bristol. Despite training as a fireman during the worst attacks on that city, in late 1940 and 1941, Bird still found time to give occasional talks on photography. He was eventually seconded from Bristol to the Crown Film Unit in London, a transfer organized by his friend the documentary film-maker Humphrey Jennings.<br>
<br>After the war Bird shared a studio with the theatre photographer Houston Rogers and two others, at 85 Cromwell Road, Kensington, London. There he continued to work on images for advertising and portraiture, primarily in black and white. Bird preferred to use a whole-plate camera with a half-plate back, although later in his career he also used Rolleiflex and 35 mm cameras. On 11 July 1947 he married Margery Alice (<i>b</i>. 1913), daughter of Christian Hanckel, mining engineer. They had no children. Margery worked alongside her husband, as studio manager, for the following nineteen years, accompanied to work each day by a talkative parrot named Bobby. Bird was made a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1948, and in the 1950s he took over the large studio of his close friend and fellow portrait photographer Mountstuart William Elphinstone (1871&#150;1957) at 49 Queen's Gate.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Bird encouraged and supported students of photography. He formed a teaching partnership with the photographer Dorothy Wilding in the 1950s and campaigned alongside other practitioners for the creation of a degree course in photography. For many years he was a member of the distinctions panel of the Royal Photographic Society and in 1959 was accorded a solo exhibition, which focused on his formal black and white portrait studies of well-known contemporary Britons, including the broadcaster Richard Dimbleby and the Nobel prizewinning scientist Sir Robert Robinson. The exhibition secured Bird's position as one of the most successful photographers of his generation.<br>
<br>On the death of the photographer Walter Stoneman in 1958 Bird took over his position as chief photographer for the firm J. Russell &amp; Sons, purchasing the entire business in December 1961. Bird also superseded Stoneman as the official photographer for the national photographic record of distinguished persons, which had been initiated by the National Portrait Gallery in 1917 to record important and influential citizens. These photographs were never intended for exhibition, but were rather a factual record of distinguished Britons in the archive of the National Portrait Gallery. His sitters ranged from peers, prime ministers, and such politicians as Harold Wilson and Edward Heath, to bishops, commanding officers of the armed forces, fellows of the Royal Society, Royal Academicians, and subjects from the arts like Barbara Hepworth, Sybil Thorndike, and Maggie Teyte. These formal, simple, black and white studio portraits are perhaps more imaginatively lit, and appear less bland, than those by Stoneman. Almost without exception they are three-quarter profile head and shoulder shots. They served a very different purpose from Bird's early lavish figure studies, and it is thus unsurprising that their style is equally contrasting. In total he photographed 1370 sitters for the national photographic record, and many of these images illustrate entries in the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>Walter Bird's appearance was dapper and conservative. In the studio he worked with rigour and enthusiasm:<blockquote>Everyone who sat for him was given the feeling that the sitting was a major event in Walter Bird's life. He gave his whole self to the business of interesting his sitter, posing him or her, and adjusting the lighting in his effort to make each photograph the best he had ever taken. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 March 1969)</blockquote>In 1967 the business was sold to Godfrey Argent, and Bird retired with his wife to a farmhouse at Trap, near Llandeilo Fawr, in Carmarthenshire. Two years later, while on holiday in Swaziland, he suffered a stroke, and he died there on 4 March 1969.<br>
<br>In 1993 the Royal Photographic Society curator Pam Roberts and the photographer Vincent Stokes mounted an exhibition at the Long Gallery, Bath, of forty of Bird's Vivex Carbro prints and black and white nudes from the society's collection. The show revived the reputation of a photographer described by Charles Wheeler, president of the Royal Academy, as &#145;one of the most distinguished, if not <i>the</i> most distinguished, photographers of important people living&#146;  (<span class="italic">Photographic Journal</span>, January 1960, 12).<br>
