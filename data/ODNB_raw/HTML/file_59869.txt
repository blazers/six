<span class="headword">Barnes,  Djuna Chappell</span>  (1892&#150;1982), <span class="occ">writer and artist</span>, was born on 12 June 1892 in a log cabin on Storm King Mountain, Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York state, USA. She was the daughter of an American father, Wald Harold Barnes (1865&#150;1934), and an English mother, Elizabeth Chappell (1862&#150;1945), both of whom were caretakers of the estate of Wald's brother at the time of her birth. Djuna described her father as a &#145;cabinet maker, a painter, a novelist, a poet, a musician who played five instruments, a composer who wrote librettos for his own operas, a man who could never stay put&#146;  (Herring, 25). He was also an advocate of free love, and his mistress Fanny Faulkner joined the household when Djuna was five. Djuna later accused her father of arranging for a neighbour to take her virginity. The large family&#151;which consisted of her elder brother, Thurn, younger brothers, Zendon, Saxon, and Shangar, and several half-siblings&#151;was presided over by her grandmother Zadel Barnes, a journalist and theosophist, who knew Speranza Wilde and Eleanor Marx. Djuna was exceptionally close to her grandmother, perhaps incestuously so, and would always turn to her when in difficulty.<br>
<br>About 1895 the family moved to a farm in New York state. The children were educated mainly at home, and encouraged to write. Djuna was also encouraged by Zadel to &#145;marry&#146; Fanny Faulkner's 52-year-old brother Percy in summer 1910, but it is not certain that an official ceremony took place. They lived in Bridgeport but Djuna left after two months, and returned to the farm. She nursed a lifelong resentment: &#145;father and his bastard children and mistresses had thrown me off marriage and babies&#146;  (Herring, 33).<br>
<br>Difficult years followed her parents' divorce in 1912. Djuna felt bound to help support her mother and brothers. She attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1912 to 1913, and excelled in pictorial composition, but left to become a freelance journalist. She contributed short stories, Beardsley-esque drawings, theatrical reviews, interviews, and news reports for almost every English-language newspaper in New York; Carl Van Vechten at the <span class="italic">New York Press</span> called her his &#145;favourite genius&#146;  (Herring, 76). From 1914 to 1916 she was engaged to the bon vivant Ernst (Putzi) Hanfstaengl (1887&#150;1975), later chief minister of the foreign press for Hitler. Ultimately, however, he refused to marry her because she was not German.<br>
<br>Barnes's first major publication was <span class="italic">A Book of Repulsive Women</span> (1915), a satire on women's sexual roles, which she called &#145;a disgusting little item&#146;, and of which she later burnt as many copies as she could find  (O'Neal, 98). This book also contained illustrations&#151;from 1915 to 1916 she studied at the Art Students' League of New York. From 1916 she lived in Greenwich Village among painters, artists, and writers, and with her new lover, the drama critic Courtenay Lemon (1883&#150;1933), known for his socialist views. She was closely associated with the Provincetown Players, the theatre collective that launched Eugene O'Neill, and they influenced the dramatic pieces she wrote for the <span class="italic">New York Morning Telegraph</span>. These were not meant to be acted, but read as dialogue, and they show the emergence of her distinctive style: epigrams and striking imagery, with flashes of bitter wit. The best of her early work, including the short story &#145;A Night among the Horses&#146; and the play <span class="italic">Three from the Earth</span>, was published in Margaret Anderson's and Jane Heap's <span class="italic">Little Review</span> between 1918 and 1922.<br>
<br>Barnes began a long association with Paris in 1921 with a journalistic assignment for <span class="italic">McCall's</span>. In the following year she interviewed James Joyce for an article that appeared in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. They became friends and Joyce sent Barnes a copy of the proof sheets of <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>. Inspired by his stylistic virtuosity, she began to move away from the Wildean formalism of her early work. A collection of her short stories, <span class="italic">A Book</span>, appeared in 1923, and was later republished as <span class="italic">A Night among the Horses</span> (1929). About this time Barnes became part of the expatriate group which included Man Ray, Hemingway, Yeats, Gertrude Stein, and Mina Loy. Her striking beauty&#151;auburn hair and angular features&#151;along with her famous black cape, her haughty manner, and cruel, &#145;wisecracking tongue&#146;  (McAlmon, 34), made her a legendary character. She featured in almost every literary memoir of Paris at this time. She was also part of Natalie Clifford Barney's lesbian circle, immortalized in her wickedly satirical <span class="italic">Ladies Almanack</span> (published privately and pseudonymously, under the name &#145;a Lady of Fashion&#146;, in 1928). That same year she produced <span class="italic">Ryder</span>, a novel based on an extended family much like her own. It had a Chaucerian bawdiness, with her own scatological illustrations, and dazzled with its array of styles and voices.<br>
<br>Barnes's time in Paris was dominated by her relationship with the American artist Thelma Ellen Wood (1901&#150;1970). When Thelma's promiscuity and drunkenness ended the affair in 1928, Barnes started work on her novel <span class="italic">Nightwood</span>. It is a highly charged work, linguistically complex, and riven with pain and loss. It centres on the anguished narratives of Matthew O'Connor, a transvestite gynaecologist, and Nora Flood, who is in love with the enigmatic and boyish woman Robin Vote. Barnes's friend Emily Coleman saw &#145;a new suffering, a new intensity&#146; in the work: &#145;There has been nothing written of such intense jealousy before&#146;  (Fuchs, 31). It has one of the most shattering endings in modern literature. It took years for Barnes to find a publisher, until Coleman pressured T. S. Eliot at Faber and Faber to accept it. Eliot, who wrote the preface, thought it was like an Elizabethan tragedy for its &#145;quality of horror and doom&#146;  (preface, Faber edn, 1985).<br>
<br>During the 1930s Barnes was restless: she was in New York and Tangier with the writer Charles Henri Ford, eighteen years her junior, but she felt that after Thelma Wood there was &#145;no room for any other &#147;terrible attraction&#148;&#146;  (Guirl-Stearley, 114). In summer 1932 and 1933 she stayed with her benefactor Peggy Guggenheim and her entourage at Hayford Hall in Devon, where, despite the almost incessant drinking and sexual high jinks, she wrote and reworked much of <span class="italic">Nightwood</span>. Pregnant after a fling with the French painter Jean Oberl&eacute;, she had an abortion in Paris in June 1933, performed by Dan Mahoney, the model for <span class="italic">Nightwood's</span> Matthew O'Connor. She worked for the Works Progress Administration to compile a guide to New York, and then, with <span class="italic">Nightwood</span> finally settled at Faber, Barnes spent much of 1936&#150;7 in London and Paris, where her drinking got steadily worse. <span class="italic">Nightwood</span> was published to mixed reviews in October 1937: her friend Edwin Muir hailed it &#145;an undeniable work of genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 28 Oct 1936), but Philip Rahv denounced its &#145;minute shudders of decadence&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Masses</span>, 4 May 1937).<br>
<br>Ill and depressed, Barnes returned to New York in October 1939, and was sent to a sanatorium by her family in the following year. She produced no new work in the 1940s primarily because of her alcoholism, which did not abate until the early 1950s. In September 1940 she moved to a one-roomed apartment at 5 Patchin Place, Greenwich Village, where, apart from a final voyage to Europe in 1950, she spent the rest of her life. She became, as she described in a rare interview, &#145;a form of Trappist&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Times Book Review</span>, 24 May 1971). Her play <span class="italic">The Antiphon</span> (1958), about hatred between mother and daughter, was set in her mother's birthplace in Oakham, Rutland. It was a poisonous revenge on her family. The <span class="italic">New York Times Book Review</span> (20 April 1958) pronounced it &#145;scarcely a play&#146;, adding that &#145;one cannot imagine it on any stage&#146;. It was performed in Stockholm in 1961. A clutch of poems and <span class="italic">Spillway</span> (1962), a further collection of stories, followed.<br>
<br>As her public life diminished, Barnes's status grew. Critical interest increased in the 1960s and 1970s, despite her attempts to block any enquiries (she ascribed her desire to protect her privacy to her &#145;English blood&#146;). Increasingly cantankerous, she refused to allow critics to quote from her work, but her elegance and wit remained until the end. After an attempted suicide with pills in the late 1970s, she said she woke up feeling better than she had for years. She died of natural causes at 5 Patchin Place on 19 June 1982. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at Storm King Mountain. A collection of poems, <span class="italic">Creatures in an Alphabet</span>, appeared after her death. No longer the &#145;most famous unknown in the world&#146;  (Kaever, 5), Barnes is now considered one of the most significant writers of the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
