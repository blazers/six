<span class="headword">Hedges,  Frederick Albert  Mitchell-</span>  (1882&#150;1959), <span class="occ">adventurer and travel writer</span>, was born in Barnsbury, Islington, London, on 22 October 1882, the eldest of four children of John Hedges (1847&#150;1934), a dealer in precious metals and jewellery from Aston Abbotts, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Julia Alice (<i>b</i>. 1852), daughter of Martin Goldstein, a Polish-born silversmith. In common with other members of his family Frederick adopted the name Mitchell from his paternal grandmother, Louisa Mitchell, and from his early twenties signed himself Mitchell-Hedges. Educated at Berkhamsted School and University College School, London, he renounced formal education at sixteen and at the instigation of his father joined a copper prospecting expedition to northern Norway under George Brooke Mee. After returning to London he worked as a clerk in the stock exchange until early 1902 when he departed for Montreal, then to New York, to seek his fortune on Wall Street. Back in London and running a stockbroking business, he married on 24 November 1906 Lilian Agnes (Dolly) Clarke (<i>b</i>. 1878), the Pimlico-resident daughter of Alexander Clarke, deceased, and his wife, Charlotte. The couple subsequently moved into Charlotte's country house at Sandbanks, near Parkstone, Dorset, and although they enjoyed separate lives for the next forty years they appear to have remained on friendly terms, Frederick, throughout his travels, consistently nominating Lilian as next of kin.<br>
<br>Between 1907 and 1918 Mitchell-Hedges visited the United States on at least three occasions, and in 1913 migrated to Mexico, where he might have been associated with the rebel leader Pancho Villa. He was back in England early in 1914 when he fathered a son, Frederick Joseph Stanners Mitchell-Hedges (<i>d</i>. 1977), with a Miss Mary Florence Stanners. The son became an officer in the Royal Artillery, serving for some time in Tanganyika. Mitchell-Hedges' third visit to New York in January 1917 brought him into contact with Lev Davidovich Bronstein (Leon Trotsky). Later that year he set out for Port Colborne, Ontario, to trace the surviving members of the le Guillon family, whom he had met in France in 1906 and who had since emigrated to Canada. Finding that the mother had died in childbirth, and the father on the western front, he was persuaded to adopt a ten-year-old daughter of the family, Anne-Marie (Anna or Sammy) le Guillon (1907&#150;2007), whom he took back to New York and subsequently dispatched to boarding school. Mitchell-Hedges returned to England in 1919; then, after declining work with the intelligence service in Russia, he spent more than a year in the Central American republics before returning via New York on 24 December 1920. The precise reasons for this excursion remain uncertain, although ships' records give his occupation as &#145;merchant&#146;.<br>
<br>Until now Mitchell-Hedges had suffered mixed fortunes, and in July 1912 his stockbroking partnership, Pembery, Robinson &amp; Co., had faced bankruptcy after an affair involving artificially depressed share prices. But in 1921, following a chance encounter at Waterloo Station, he entered a financially beneficial liaison with the wealthy deep-sea angler and self-styled explorer Lady Lilian Mabel Alice Richmond Brown (1885&#150;1946), daughter of Robert Roussel of Guernsey and estranged wife of Sir Melville Richmond Brown, third baronet. The following year they sailed for Panama, fished together, and spent time with the Kuna people on the R&iacute;o Chucunaque. Back in England in March 1923 Mitchell-Hedges recalled their angling exploits in his first book, <span class="italic">Battles with Giant Fish</span>, while Richmond Brown, in <span class="italic">Unknown Tribes, Uncharted Seas</span>, offered an absurd and patronizing account of the allegedly uncontacted Kuna, a tribe known since the time of Columbus. A number of Kuna artefacts were donated to the Pitt Rivers Museum; then later that year, in the company of the artist and yachtsman Henry Scott Tuke (1858&#150;1929), the couple sailed again for Central America, this time in search of vanished Mayan cities in the forests of Honduras.<br>
<br>Returning to England with Richmond Brown on 25 May 1924, and now a minor celebrity, Mitchell-Hedges engaged a secretary, Gladys Harvey (Jane) Houlson (<i>b</i>. 1899), and later that year set out with Houlson and Richmond Brown for British Honduras. There they encountered the retired district medical officer and archaeologist Thomas William Francis Gann (1868&#150;1938), who guided them to Lubaantun, a ninth-century Mayan city that Gann had first discovered in 1903. After returning on 20 September 1925, and in an article for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> claiming the discovery for themselves, Mitchell-Hedges and his party were sent back to Lubaantun to conduct more extensive excavations under the auspices of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Their work resulted in the discovery of a stone-built amphitheatre, the first ever found on the American continent. It also prompted the British Museum to dispatch three annual expeditions, 1926&#150;8, under the direction of the professional archaeologist and museum curator Thomas Athol Joyce (1878&#150;1942). Mitchell-Hedges' party returned to England on 3 October 1926, soon after which he returned to Honduras to spend five years based at Roat&aacute;n, sometimes with Houlson and Richmond Brown, angling and prospecting around the Islas de la Bah&iacute;a, where he is reputed to have discovered pirate treasure and to have excavated twenty-one sites, recovering artefacts he was convinced came from the lost civilization of Atlantis.<br>
<br>In 1931 Mitchell-Hedges was named as co-respondent when Richmond Brown was divorced in an action brought on behalf of her husband (whose affairs were under the control of a master in lunacy). Extensive financial resettlements followed, and from that date Mitchell-Hedges travelled almost exclusively in the company of his secretary, Houlson, commuting between New York and Central America in 1932&#150;3 and 1933&#150;4. On the second of these trips, from which he returned to Philadelphia on 17 May 1934, and the rest of his party on 28 September 1934, he was escorted by his adopted daughter, Anna. In 1934, on the death of his father, he returned briefly to England, and in the same year Anna went to Paris to train as a beautician and later manage a salon on the liner <i>Normandie</i>. On 16 August 1934 Mitchell-Hedges arrived back in New York where he hosted a weekly radio show, aired on Sunday evenings, telling dramatic tales over a background of jungle drums. After a flirtatious affair with a Mrs Shepherd, a New York socialite, he apparently was married a second time, &#145;after securing a divorce in Mexico&#146;, to a gold-digger named Dorothy Copp. The marriage lasted only briefly and in 1938 Dorothy sued for divorce.<br>
<br>Mitchell-Hedges returned to England to live at Coverack, Cornwall, and began a lucrative trade in antique silver that would support him comfortably for the rest of his life. During the Second World War he lived with Anna at Uplands and Burgate Manor, Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where he reputedly entertained prominent politicians and generals. In October 1943 he purchased at Sothebys for &pound;400 a skull allegedly fashioned out of crystal that had previously fallen into the hands of the London art dealer Sydney Burney. The so-called &#145;crystal skull&#146;, which had first surfaced in London around 1933 and would in later years bring Mitchell-Hedges name to the fore, was claimed to have been carved by a lost pre-Columbian civilization and was said to possess mystic powers. Contemporary records point wholly against the claim by Anna le Guillon that the skull had been discovered at Lubaantun in 1924. It is now recognized that the skull is a modern forgery probably manufactured shortly before its appearance in London.<br>
<br>In 1946 Mitchell-Hedges and Anna moved to Canterton Manor, Brook, Hampshire. Between 1948 and early 1950 they twice visited South Africa, apparently at the invitation of Field Marshal Jan Smuts. Mitchell-Hedges made several generous bequests from his collection of silver, and at St Lucia, a favourite scenic resort, Anna received (then on her second visit sold) a hotel and several surrounding properties. Passenger lists also confirm that Mitchell-Hedges' wife Lilian, now resident at Polperro, Cornwall, returned from South Africa in February 1952 and might have been a member of the party. In 1953 he, Lilian, and Anna moved to a substantial estate at Farley Hill, near Reading, Berkshire, where he penned his reminiscences <span class="italic">Danger my Ally</span>, then in 1958 he and Anna moved to Shaldon House, Shaldon, near Teignmouth in Devon. Mitchell-Hedges died at Shaldon House, of a stroke, on 12 June 1959 and was cremated at Torquay crematorium three days later. His ashes were scattered into the sea off Shaldon by his devoted Anna, to whom Mitchell-Hedges had previously signed over much of his fortune. Anna eventually migrated back to Canada, bought a motel in Kitchener, Ontario, and spoke widely of her experiences. She died in April 2007 at the age of a hundred.<br>
<br>Although Mitchell-Hedges led a moderately interesting life as a stockbroker and entrepreneur turned angler and amateur archaeologist, his reputation as an explorer has been vastly exaggerated, largely as a result of the edifice of mystery erected around him by his less rational devotees. In fact, had it not been for his association with the crystal skull controversy, he might well have sunk into the obscurity that befell so many others of his genre. Careful analysis of ships' passenger lists and other reliable documents confirms that the basic framework of travels portrayed in his writings is essentially truthful, but his inclination to overstate the significance of his adventures, his eagerness to embrace the unorthodox, and his propensity for transforming pedestrian exploits into epics of survival and discovery have tended to compromise whatever genuine contribution he might have made to the field of exploration, archaeology, and natural history.<br>
