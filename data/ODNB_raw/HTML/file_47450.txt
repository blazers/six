<span class="headword">Richards,  (Franklin Thomas) Grant</span>  (1872&#150;1948), <span class="occ">publisher and writer</span>, was born on 21 October 1872 at University Hall, Hillhead, Partick, Lanarkshire, the first of two children of Franklin Thomas Richards (<i>d</i>. 1905), at the time assistant to the chairman of Latin at the University of Glasgow, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jerrard. He spent his early years in Oxford, where his father by 1894 had assumed the post of fellow and tutor in Latin at Trinity College. He attended school at Langdale House, Oxford, from 1880, and later the City of London School. Known from his early years as Grant, as a child he remained emotionally distant from his family but was influenced strongly by an uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/373/', "(Charles) Grant Blairfindie Allen (1848&#150;1899)")</script>, a prolific author of works of fiction and natural science. Grant Allen recognized Richards's interest in publishing and in 1888 arranged a job for him as junior clerk with the wholesale booksellers Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co., and in 1890 obtained him a position with W. T. Stead on the <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, where for the next six years he was involved with editorial work and reviewing.<br>
<br>With financial backing from Allen, another uncle, and his father, Richards opened his own publishing house in January 1897 at 9 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London. Under the imprint of Grant Richards, his substantial list that year included the first volumes in Grant Allen's <span class="roman">Historical Guides</span> series, <span class="italic">Paris</span> and <span class="italic">Florence</span>, Allen's <span class="italic">The Evolution of the Idea of God</span>, E. V. Lucas's <span class="italic">A Book of Verse for Children</span>, and Stead's <span class="italic">Real Ghost Stories</span>. In 1898 Richards published works by two of the major authors on which his reputation rests: G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant</span>, and A. E. Housman's <span class="italic">A Shropshire Lad</span>. He was also married in 1898; he and his first wife, Elisina Richards, had three sons, Gerard, Geoffrey, and Charles, and a daughter, Gioia. Richards remained Housman's publisher throughout the rest of his career, but more commonly authors published a few books with his firm and then moved on to more prominent houses; G. B. Shaw, G. K. Chesterton, Alfred Noyes, John Masefield, Hector H. Munro (Saki), Arnold Bennett, and Maurice Baring were of this number. Nevertheless, Richards's inspiration, energy, and taste served in identifying rising or under-appreciated writers of fiction and poetry (such as Samuel Butler, whose <span class="italic">The Way of All Flesh</span> he published in 1903), in producing expensive multi-volume collected works of Shakespeare and Jane Austen, and in initiating series including the <span class="roman">World's Classics</span> and the <span class="roman">Dumpy Books for Children</span> (which included Helen Bannerman's now infamous <span class="italic">Story of Little Black Sambo</span> in 1899). He was particularly attentive to the design of his books, many of which featured a distinctive fleuron on the title-page.<br>
<br>Richards's move in 1902 into larger London offices at 48 Leicester Square was a sign of his financial overreach, which led, in April 1905, to bankruptcy. Undaunted, he reorganized the firm, adding to his imprint the initial of his wife's name (trading as E. Grant Richards), and moving later that year to smaller offices at 7 Carlton Street. In 1908 the firm reverted to Richards's name and moved to 8 St Martin's Street. In the ensuing two decades Richards honed his already sharp eye for authors. In 1914, after nine years of sporadic negotiation with James Joyce over the blunt language of some of his short stories, Richards published <span class="italic">Dubliners</span>, and while declining Joyce's <span class="italic">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>, followed it with Joyce's play <span class="italic">Exiles</span> in 1918. A critical and financial success despite similarly risqu&eacute; allusions was Thomas Burke's collection of stories about London's Chinatown, <span class="italic">Limehouse Nights</span> (1916). Alec Waugh's revelatory novel of public-school life, <span class="italic">The Loom of Youth</span> (1917), was a further success which led to his publication of six further books with Richards. Other authors of critical note that Richards published during these years included Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell, Eden Phillpotts, and T. Sturge Moore. He published his own novel <span class="italic">Caviare</span> in 1912, following it with seven other novels. In 1917 he began a series of distinctive advertisements in the form of chatty columns in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>.<br>
<br>Richards moved from London to Cookham Dean, Berkshire, after his bankruptcy, commuting via train to London. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1914, and on 2 July 1915 he married Maria Magdalena de Csan&aacute;dy (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), a widow, and the daughter of Emil Csan&aacute;dy, an officer in the Hungarian army. He entertained friends and authors at Sunday night dinner parties, spent a good deal of time travelling in France, and recorded his appreciation for the Riviera in <span class="italic">The Coast of Pleasure</span> (1928). The monocle that he wore in his right eye for most of his adult life&#151;along with his taste in clothing, food, and wine&#151;manifested the social grace for which he was known, and which for him was inextricable from the conduct of business.<br>
<br>Financial mismanagement led Richards for the second time into bankruptcy in 1926. The firm was renamed the Richards Press; Richards himself continued partial involvement for the next few years, but gradually left publishing to write his desultory but engaging memoirs <span class="italic">Memories of a Misspent Youth, 1872&#150;1896</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Author Hunting by an Old Literary Sportsman: Memories of Years Spent Mainly in Publishing, 1897&#150;1925</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Housman, 1897&#150;1936</span> (1942). He sold his home in Cookham Dean in 1927, and lived at several addresses in London until moving to Moor Park, Surrey, in 1946. He died in Monte Carlo following a long illness on 24 February 1948; his wife survived him.<br>
