<span class="headword">Ker,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1768), <span class="occ">jeweller and politician</span>, was the son of Thomas Ker of Edinburgh, deacon of the corporation and a magistrate of the city, and his wife, Margaret, daughter and coheir of John Kerr of the Canongate. His grandfather was Sir Thomas Ker of Redden, Roxburghshire, the brother of Robert, first earl of Ancrum. Nothing is known of his early life, but on 8 July 1725 he married Jean (<i>d</i>. 1746), daughter of Gavin Thompson, writer to the signet, of Lowget, Edinburgh; the couple had three sons and eleven daughters. In 1734 he was elected deacon of the Incorporation of Goldsmiths, and became engraver to the mint and assay master in 1745.<br>
<br>Ker is reported as having commanded a company of gentleman volunteers, presumably during the Jacobite rising of 1745&#150;6, and if so this probably helped his election on 2 December 1746 to the burgh council of the city of Edinburgh, as deacon of the Goldsmiths. He remained a member until 1754, and was elected convenor of the ordinary council deacons in 1747 and 1750. In 1747 Ker was returned as member of parliament for Edinburgh on the interest of the incorporated trades, of which he was in that year convenor. Although a government supporter himself, he had opposed George Drummond, lord provost of Edinburgh, the candidate supported by the prime minister, Henry Pelham. Ker accordingly called on the third duke of Argyll and wrote to Pelham the day after his election, to apologize for standing against their candidate and promising his support for the government. Argyll gave him qualified approval; earlier in the year, on 23 July, he had written to Pelham:<blockquote>Mr Ker, the Jeweller, is certainly a Whig, but he was too much a Patriot at a certain time to be a favourite of mine, &amp; I am told that he is weak &amp; whymsical, though his professions of zeal for the present Administration is strong enough. (U. Nott. L., MS Ne C 1946/2)</blockquote>On receipt of a friendly reply from Pelham, Ker wrote fulsomely of his loyalty to the administration, and was rewarded with a secret-service pension of &pound;300 per annum. No record remains of Ker's parliamentary activities and it seems likely that he was content to act as a loyal government supporter rather than attempting to make a mark. On the burgh council he appears to have been meddlesome and unco-operative, and to have made many enemies. He was said to have formed an overweening sense of his own status and to have become haughty and vain. By the time of the next election Argyll reported to Pelham that Ker's behaviour and attitude had earned him the hatred and contempt of his fellow citizens. He had apparently highly disobliged many members of the council by bringing in members of the opposite party (who then campaigned against Ker himself), and had made enemies of the merchants by opposing their scheme to improve the harbour of Leith. In addition, a number of traders complained of his high-handed and contemptuous treatment of them, the result being: &#145;the town will not bear Mr Ker&#146;  (Argyll to Pelham, 5 Nov 1753, U. Nott. L., MS Ne C 2215). In 1754 he lost his place on the council and in the same year was not put up for re-election to parliament, and consequently lost his secret-service pension.<br>
<br>Ker's wife, Jean, died on 10 October 1746, and on 6 August 1750 he married for a second time, his bride on this occasion being Elizabeth (Betty) Ker (1713/14&#150;1799), daughter of the late Lord Charles Ker, former director of the chancery and son of the first marquess of Lothian. This marriage resulted in five sons and two daughters. James Ker died on 24 January 1768 at Drumsheugh, near Edinburgh. For much of his life he had held property both in Edinburgh and at Bughtrig, Roxburghshire. His second wife outlived him, and died on 21 February 1799, at the age of eighty-five.<br>
