<span class="headword">Allen, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1544), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was born in Thaxted, Essex, into an agrarian family of moderate means. His father, Richard Allen, apprenticed him to Roger Bourchier of the London Mercers' Company, to which he was admitted in 1497. Allen was elected a warden of the Mercers in 1509, making him eligible for ward office, and in 1515 he was nominated alderman from Langbourn and Vintry wards. When Allen's nomination was rejected by the court of aldermen, the freemen from Vintry ward, where the Mercers maintained an almshouse, elected him anyway. Allen was nominated alderman from eight other wards during a civic career that spanned three decades. He rose to the status of master mercer in 1518, and was designated one of two London sheriffs by Lord Mayor Thomas Exmew that same year. In 1523 Allen translated from Vintry to Lime Street ward and in 1525 the court of common council elected him lord mayor of London. As was customary, Henry VIII knighted the new officer.<br>
<br>During Allen's first term, following a decision in Star Chamber that aliens must contribute to the king's treasury just as natural-born citizens did, foreigners were ordered to come before the mayor, swear allegiance to the monarch, and indicate their wealth. At the same time the city ordered a boycott of immigrant merchants who imported woad, simultaneously damaging their businesses while taxing them. Thus Allen's first mayoralty, called &#145;distinguished&#146; by Lyell and Watney  (p. xxiii), has been branded as xenophobic by others.<br>
<br>In late 1525 or early 1526 Allen was sworn as a councillor to the king, part of the outer ring of advisers stationed at Westminster that dealt with criminal matters. Allen served on a number of government commissions for the jurisdiction of London, including those for the peace, tax collection, and the property of lunatics. In August 1532 he and Thomas Cromwell were examiners in a treason trial; two months later Allen was among a dozen signatories to a letter &#145;from Council Chamber, Westminster&#146;, sent to the king advising him of plague around the inns of court  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 5, no. 1421). Stow refers to Allen in 1536 as &#145;one of the king's council&#146;  (Stow, 242). As a councillor Allen was the recipient of many gifts from the monarch and purchased a suppressed priory at Hatfield Peverel in Essex. Allen also adjudicated disputes involving the Merchant Adventurers, of which he was a member, during the decade after his first mayoralty.<br>
<br>Allen no doubt anticipated a peaceful retirement from municipal duties and bought a large house in Sything Lane in Tower Street ward. In 1535, however, the king proclaimed to common council his preference for Allen to serve as mayor again in the coming year. Despite the custom of a single-term limit for London mayors during Tudor times and Allen's sincere reluctance to accept the office, he was elected, one of only two men to serve twice during the reign of Henry VIII. Allen was instrumental in keeping London calm during the tumultuous events of 1536 and personally arranged for the supplying of horses to the king's men during the Pilgrimage of Grace. Fearful of economic depression in the city after the dissolution of the monasteries, Allen asked Cromwell to allocate &pound;10,000 as a subsidy for St Bartholomew's fair in Smithfield. By royal command, the lord mayor and a deputation of aldermen attended the arraignment and trial of Anne Boleyn. They also witnessed her execution; Allen ordered all foreigners excluded from the vicinity. During his second mayoralty King Henry and Jane Seymour attended the marching watch of the city on St Peter's night from the vantage point of the newly built Mercers' Hall. In late 1536 Allen received the designation &#145;Father of the City&#146; from the court of aldermen.<br>
<br>Allen contended with Thomas Barnaby, a fellow mercer, over a loan of &pound;100 made by Allen to Barnaby in 1537 for the lease of his house in security. Cromwell urged Allen to be patient with Barnaby, but Allen's misgivings proved prescient. In the autumn of 1541, after Cromwell's fall and Allen's retirement from government service, Barnaby convinced the privy council to act against the former mayor; Allen was ordered to &#145;compound with Thomas Barnaby for his debt and to restore the lease of a house Barnaby had given him in caution&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 16, no. 1155).<br>
<br>Allen has been described as a bachelor by some sources, and his sons are labelled illegitimate by official records. However, the Mercers' records indicate that his tomb contained enough room &#145;for him and his wife&#146;  (Watney, 103). This was probably the Elizabeth Jay who was the major beneficiary of Allen's will. Allen also had a romance with a much younger woman, the sister of Lady Sidney, and gossip about his behaviour was relayed to Cromwell, who lamented Allen's indiscreet conduct.<br>
<br>Allen died in London in September 1544, and was initially buried in a &#145;fair and beautiful chapel, arched over with stone, by him built&#146; adjacent to the former St Thomas of Acon Hospital and to the Mercers' Hall in Cheape ward  (Stow, 103, 242). By Stow's time Allen's tomb had been removed to the main Mercers' church and his chapel had been divided into leased shops; vandals had defaced many of the funerary monuments in the Mercers' church including Allen's. Allen left portions of his sizeable estate throughout England to three sons, John, Christopher, and Lazarus. Sir William Paget had the right to wardship and marriage of Christopher and Lazarus Allen; the brothers eventually married Paget's daughters Margaret and Agnes. Allen consigned his London house and lands in Middlesex to Elizabeth Jay, probably his mistress and the mother of Christopher and Lazarus; he also entrusted her with &#145;the keeping of John, my fool&#146;, during his natural life. He bestowed large amounts for poor relief, including &pound;50 to be shared among the poor at 10<i>s</i>. per week, &pound;10 for poor maidens' marriages, and 500 marks to stock sea coal, financed by rent from his Essex estate. Stow included Allen in his roll of honourable citizens, noting that Allen gave to the city of London &#145;a rich collar of gold&#146; to be worn by the mayor  (Stow, 103). The lord mayor's collar, composed of twenty-eight ornate SS links joined by alternate enamel Tudor roses and gold knots, was first worn by Sir William Laxton, mayor in 1548.<br>
