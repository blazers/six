<span class="headword">Gallars,  Nicolas  des</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1581), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born in Paris or its environs about 1520, the son of Richard des Gallars and his wife, Ysabeau. Although little is known about his background, he inherited the title of seigneur de Saules, and there survive occasional references to his family. Calvin reported in August 1547 that Nicolas had returned to Paris to visit his mother, and intended to come back with his sister, who was being badly treated by their stepfather, Nicole Thibault. Following the death of his mother, Nicolas and his sisters Jehanne and Marie were in dispute over their inheritance. This was resolved in May 1554, but the family's affairs were in a poor state following the death of Marie, the mother of the minister Michel le Faulcheur, according to a letter to Calvin in late October 1561.<br>
<br>Known as Gallasius, des Gallars became a minister in Geneva in June 1544, and a member of the company of pastors; he was one of those delegated by the company to undertake a visitation of parishes in 1547 and again in 1552. Like Jean Cousin, he was one of a group of young pastors who recorded Calvin's sermons and acted as his secretary. He combined his notes on the reformer's sermons on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> and <span class="roman">Genesis</span> with his lecture notes to publish biblical commentaries in Calvin's name in 1551 and 1560. Although now attributed to Calvin, he was recorded in the title as the author of the tract <span class="italic">Defensio pro Farello et collegis ejus adv. Petri Caroli theologastri calumnias</span> published in 1545. Des Gallars was responsible for translating several of Calvin's tracts from Latin: <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de la c&egrave;ne</span> (1545), <span class="italic">Inventaire des reliques</span> (1548), and <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; contre les anabaptistes et les libertins</span> (1549). He was also a biblical scholar in his own right, publishing his <span class="italic">Commentarii in Exodum, cum textu biblica</span> (Geneva, 1560) and contributing to the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Des Gallars became a citizen of Geneva on 11 June 1551. In the same year he was sent as Calvin's personal envoy to England, with letters for Edward VI and Protector Somerset, presenting the king with a copy of Calvin's sermons on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> which he had translated. In 1553 he took up the ministry at Jussy, but was replaced in June 1555 and returned to Geneva. On 16 August 1557, however, he left Geneva for Paris in response to a request for a minister, successfully evading capture by the French authorities near Dijon. But his ministry in the capital was cut short by the religious crisis which followed the affair of the rue St Jacques, when a mob attacked a Calvinist meeting and over 130 people were arrested, three of them being subsequently burnt, and a replacement minister was dispatched from Geneva on 1 January 1558. Des Gallars returned to Paris to attend the first national synod of the Reformed church in May 1559, as Calvin's personal envoy to the meeting.<br>
<br>The consistory of the French church in London wrote to Geneva in March 1560 to request a minister, suggesting that Viret, Beza, or des Gallars might be sent. Calvin authorized the departure of des Gallars and he arrived in London in June 1560. To the embarrassment of the consistory, the eminent minister Pierre Alexandre had in the interim arrived in London, successfully interceded for the restoration of St Anthony's chapel in Threadneedle Street, and had served as the congregation's minister. Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, who had endorsed the letter to Calvin and was also superintendent of the exile churches, was forced to intervene and called upon the church to accept des Gallars as their minister. The latter then overhauled the institutions of the London French church to bring them more into line with Geneva, in fact repeating some sections of the Genevan church order verbatim. The resulting changes anticipated the future growth of the church and ensured that in later years it developed along Calvinist lines. This new church order, <span class="italic">Forme de police ecclesiastique</span>, was published in both Latin and French in 1561.<br>
<br>In August 1561 des Gallars was summoned by the Huguenot leader Coligny to be a delegate at the Colloquy of Poissy, and attended at the insistence of Sir William Cecil. He was an active participant at the meeting and provided regular reports for the crown through his correspondence with Grindal and the English ambassador, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. On his return to England he published <span class="italic">A True Report of all the Doynges at the Assembly Concernyng Matters of Religion, lately Holden at Poyssy in Fraunce</span> to explain, in the words of its preface, &#145;why I have bene so long absente from my churche and also what was the ende of that assemblye&#146; which he dedicated to Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford. In the following year he was involved in government negotiations with the Huguenots which in September led to the treaty of Hampton Court.<br>
<br>Des Gallars had married Gabrielle Morones in June 1545, but his wife and four children had initially remained in Geneva. In January 1561 the consistory of the French church in London sent a deacon to escort the family to England, but Gabrielle and two of the children had died by the time des Gallars came to leave London in June 1563. The academic progress of his third son, Peter (<i>b</i>. 1552), was later discussed in letters between des Gallars and Beza, who in 1570 recommended the youth to Heinrich Bullinger in Z&uuml;rich.<br>
<br>The English climate did not suit des Gallars, who received a number of calls to serve churches in France, particularly following the Colloquy of Poissy. It was suggested in 1561, for example, that he should take up the ministry at Poitiers. In March 1563 des Gallars wrote that he hoped to see Calvin at Easter, but he did not leave London until June. He received a fulsome testimony from his successor Jean Cousin, and Edmund Grindal praised his legacy in an effusive letter of thanks. Des Gallars later remembered the bishop by dedicating his commentary on Irenaeus to him in 1570.<br>
<br>In September 1563 des Gallars left Geneva to take up the ministry at Orl&eacute;ans and the post of professor of theology at the new Reformed academy over which he presided. The academy provided training for the Reformed ministry, and des Gallars reported to Beza that it attracted many students from Germany but particularly from Hainault and Lille. He published a translation of Calvin's <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de la divinit&eacute; de J&eacute;sus-Christ contre les Ariens</span> at Orl&eacute;ans in 1565, and the following year his own <span class="italic">De divina Christi filii Dei essentia</span>. Des Gallars's status meant that he played a prominent role in the French Reformed church. He was the moderator of the fifth national synod, held in Paris in December 1565, which condemned the writings of Jean Mor&eacute;ly criticizing the ecclesiastical institutions of the Reformed church. The affair continued but the discovery of a cache of letters in 1566, slandering various Genevan and French ministers, finally led to Mor&eacute;ly's disgrace. Des Gallars himself was among those slandered&#151;he was described as a liar and a fake, particularly skilled at feigning modesty and honesty both in expression and in word. Although he remained technically the minister at Orl&eacute;ans until 1571, he was forced to flee from the city in 1568; having initially considered exile in England he found refuge on the estates of Ren&eacute;e de France before returning to Geneva. He returned to France in 1571 and was secretary at the Synod of La Rochelle, which was presided over by Beza and reformed the discipline of the church.<br>
<br>The council in Geneva wrote to Beza and des Gallars in April 1571, declaring that their absence from the city was prejudicial to the work of God. Des Gallars had agreed to return to Geneva to serve the church and the academy, but in the same month, following the death of Pierre Viret, he wrote to the Genevan authorities delaying his return for a year. He entered the service of Jeanne d'Albret, queen of Navarre, in order to continue Viret's work directing the Reformation in B&eacute;arn. In the following year the Synod of N&icirc;mes heard of the continued need of the churches in B&eacute;arn for des Gallars's services, and was reluctant to refuse Jeanne's request for him to continue his ministry. The synod therefore wrote to the Genevan authorities on 18 May 1572 to inform them of its decision.<br>
<br>Although Jeanne d'Albret died soon afterwards, des Gallars continued as first minister and quasi-<i>surintendant</i> of the Reformed church in B&eacute;arn until his death. In January 1573 he married Fran&ccedil;oise de Contades. He was a professor of the academy at Lescar in 1579, and worked on an edition of Cyprian during his last years. He died in August 1581, between the 4th, when he drew up his will, and the 14th, when his estate was settled by his son Daniel.<br>
