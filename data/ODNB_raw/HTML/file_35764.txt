<span class="headword">Ritchie, Sir  Richmond Thackeray Willoughby</span>  (1854&#150;1912), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 6 August 1854 in Calcutta, the third son of William Ritchie (<i>d</i>. 1861), advocate-general of Bengal, and also legal member of the governor-general's council and vice-chancellor of Calcutta University, and his wife, Augusta, daughter of Captain Thomas Trimmer RN. Ritchie was a brilliant student and scholar, as well as an excellent sportsman. In July 1863, at the age of only nine, he gained an Eton College scholarship. At Eton he was a king's scholar, won the prince consort's French prize, and was a Newcastle medallist in his last year. He also achieved membership of the sixth form and Eton Society (Pop)&#151;a much coveted double accolade for Etonians&#151;and he was president of the Eton Literary Society. Ritchie's sporting prowess was illustrated by his inclusion in the teams of the Mixed Wall, College Wall, and College Field, and he was also an accomplished player at fives. He received a scholarship to read for the classical tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1874, where he was again active in extra-curricular activities, such as debating, becoming a member of the Magpie and Stump debating society.<br>
<br>While his father had gone to India in 1853, Ritchie's association with the subcontinent was to be at the India Office in London, which he entered through open competition, and where he served in various capacities for thirty-five years, beginning as a junior clerk while still an undergraduate in 1877. Within a few years he became private secretary to a succession of parliamentary under-secretaries of state from 1883 to 1892, including Sir John Gorst and George Nathaniel Curzon. The India Office gave Ritchie valuable experience of the intricacies of the administrative machinery of Indian administration, as well as a deeper understanding of imperial policies and problems. His efficiency and sagacity impressed the various under-secretaries with whom he worked, while his tact, good manners, and calm temperament made him a good manager of men, inspiring the affection and respect of his colleagues. On 2 August 1877 Ritchie married Anne Isabella Thackeray (1837&#150;1919) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35761/', "Ritchie, Anne Isabella")</script>], the eldest daughter of his father's first cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27155/', "William Makepeace Thackeray")</script>, and seventeen years his senior. The substantial age difference did not impede a happy and successful marriage and they had two children, a son and a daughter. Lady Ritchie wrote a number of novels, memoirs, and essays and was the literary executor of her father.<br>
<br>From October 1892 to February 1894 Ritchie was private secretary to Sir Arthur Godley (afterwards Lord Kilbracken), and in May 1894 he was appointed secretary to the royal commission on Indian expenditure, a post he held for a few weeks only, before becoming private secretary to the secretary of state for India, Lord George Hamilton. In 1898 Queen Victoria conferred on him the companionship in the Order of the Bath in recognition of his services. Hamilton wrote to Mrs Ritchie in appreciation:<blockquote>If the recognition is unusual the work recognised is exceptional. He has been my right hand man since I have been here, and I could not have got through the troubles of the past if I had not been able to rely upon his exceptional powers of work and observation, and the invariably high quality of the work he does. (19 May 1898, Leigh-Smith, 13)</blockquote>In 1902 Ritchie became secretary to the political and secret department, one of the most influential departments of the India Office. He was created KCB in June 1907, &#145;an honour&#146;, wrote Morley, &#145;to a public servant who so well deserves honour &hellip; Everyone who knows your value in the most difficult post in this office &hellip; will recognise the entire justice in what the Prime Minister has done&#146;  (J. Morley to R. T. W. Ritchie, 24 June 1907, BL OIOC, Ritchie MSS, MS Eur. C 342). The pinnacle of his career came with the retirement of Godley in 1909, when Ritchie succeeded him as the permanent under-secretary of state, the first member of the India Office staff to be so promoted. He was appointed a companion in the Imperial Service Order in 1912.<br>
<br>During his long tenure Ritchie worked with several secretaries of state and viceroys varying in temperament and politics, and was associated with a number of significant developments in the Indian empire, including the mission of Sir Francis Younghusband to Lhasa, Tibet, in 1903&#150;4, when Lord Curzon (whom he had known since his Eton days) was viceroy. The negotiations leading to the Anglo-Russian convention of 1907 saw Ritchie working in close collaboration with Lord Morley, the secretary of state for India. The discussions and formulations which resulted in the 1909 constitutional reforms for India saw him similarly working constructively with Morley. The revocation of the partition of Bengal in 1911, in which Ritchie took a close interest, followed months of secret planning and discussion with lords Crewe and Hardinge. He also personally and enthusiastically pressed the case for Edwin Lutyens to be the major architect and planning consultant for the founding of New Delhi as the new capital of British India, which was announced that same year. Ritchie's long tenure at the India Office gave him an unrivalled knowledge and experience that was invaluable for formulators of imperial policy. He was the epitome of the hard-working, perceptive, and diplomatic civil servant who rendered invaluable service in maintaining the administrative structure of the British raj.<br>
<br>However, unremitting hard work took its toll on Ritchie's health over several years. He fell ill during the summer of 1912, and in September was admitted to a nursing home at 109 St George's Square, Middlesex, where he died on Saturday 12 October of heart failure following upon toxaemia and septic pneumonia. The funeral took place at Hampstead Old Church on Tuesday 15 October.<br>
