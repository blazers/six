<span class="headword">Tennent, Sir  James Emerson</span>, first baronet  (1804&#150;1869), <span class="occ">traveller and politician</span>, third son of William Emerson (<i>d</i>. 1821), merchant, of Belfast, and Sarah, youngest daughter of William Arbuthnot, of Rockville, co. Down, was born at Belfast on 7 April 1804 and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which awarded him an honorary degree of LLD in 1861. In 1824 he travelled abroad. An enthusiast in the cause of Greek freedom, he visited Greece and met Lord Byron. His impressions of the country appeared in 1826 in <span class="italic">A Picture of Greece in 1825</span>, <span class="italic">Letters from the Aegean</span> (2 vols., 1829), and <span class="italic">The History of Modern Greece</span> (2 vols., 1830). These works received mixed notices.<br>
<br>On 28 January 1831 Emerson (as he was then known) was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, where he had become a student on the advice of Jeremy Bentham, but it is doubtful if he ever practised his profession. On 24 June 1831 he married Laetitia, only daughter and heir of William Tennent, a wealthy banker at Belfast, of Tempo Manor, co. Fermanagh. In 1832 when his father-in-law died he assumed his name and arms, in addition to his own, by royal licence, and succeeded to estates in counties Sligo and Fermanagh.<br>
<br>Tennent was elected member of parliament for Belfast on 21 December 1832. He supported Lord Grey's administration until 1834 when he joined Lord Stanley's and Sir James Graham's followers, and with them afterwards supported Peel. He favoured free trade and thought that some of the burdens of agriculture should be relieved and that tenants should be legally entitled to security of tenure if they made improvements.<br>
<br>At the election in 1837 Tennent was defeated at Belfast, but on petition was seated in 1838. In 1841 he was re-elected, but was unseated on petition. In 1842 he regained his seat, and that year performed the most important service of his parliamentary career as the chief promoter of the <span class="roman">Copyright of Designs Bill</span>, which extended protection against copying to those who had devised designs, such as those for wallpapers and textiles, to complement that accorded to inventors under the patent legislation. This was of very considerable importance to manufacturers and helped to ensure the success of the Great Exhibition of 1851, since manufacturers could safely put their products on display. He was secretary to the India board in 1841&#150;3, and remained a member of the House of Commons until July 1845, when he was knighted.<br>
<br>From 1845 to 1850 Tennent was civil secretary to the colonial government of Ceylon. On 31 December 1850 he was gazetted governor of St Helena, but he never took up the appointment. After his return home he again sat in parliament as member for Lisburn from 10 January to December 1852. In 1852 he was permanent secretary to the poor-law board and that year was made secretary to the Board of Trade. On his retirement on 2 February 1867 he was created a baronet.<br>
<br>Tennent described his stay in Ceylon in <span class="italic">Ceylon: an Account of the Island</span> (2 vols., 1859), a work which went through five editions in eight months. It contained a vast amount of information arranged with clarity and precision, and received generally good reviews. In 1861 he republished part of it as <span class="italic">Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon</span>. He published two other works on the country, in 1860 and, in 1867, <span class="italic">The Wild Elephant and the Method of Capturing and Taming it in Ceylon</span>. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 5 June 1862. He died suddenly at his home, 66 Warwick Square, Belgrave Road, London, on 6 March 1869, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 12 March. His widow died on 21 April 1883; they had two daughters, Ethel Sarah and Edith Laetitia Anna, and a son, Sir William Emerson Tennent, second baronet, who was born on 14 May 1835. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 26 January 1859, became a clerk in the Board of Trade in 1855, accompanied Sir William Hutt to Vienna in 1865 to negotiate a treaty of commerce, and was secretary to Sir Stephen Cave in the mixed commission to Paris (1866&#150;7) for revising the fishery convention. He died at Tempo Manor, co. Fermanagh, on 16 November 1876 and the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
