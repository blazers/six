<span class="headword">Lupton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1572&#150;1584), <span class="occ">political and religious controversialist</span>, does not appear in the historical record except as the author of six or seven books and some incidental compositions. Yet his <i>&#339;uvre</i> gives a good sense of a real individual. His moralistic nationalism and abhorrence of a money economy is already evident in his earliest-known composition&#151;two poems in fourteeners written in commendation of John Jones's medical treatises on the benefits of the waters of Bath and Buxton (<span class="italic">A Brief Discourse</span>, 1572, 1574), where he argues that English sores should be treated not in foreign spas but by cheaper and better English waters. The same attitudes appear in a more serious vein in his prefatory poem to Barnaby Rich's <span class="italic">Alarm to England</span> (1578). There he joins such soldier-poets as Barnabe Googe and Thomas Churchyard in urging immediate action against England's enemies.<br>
<br>The twenty-nine folios of closely written manuscript that Lupton addressed to the queen cannot be dated, but clearly they come earlier than his <span class="italic">A Persuasion from Papistry</span> (1581), where he reminds Elizabeth of his earlier proposal for &#145;a thing that is necessary, reasonable and commodious to many and hurtful to none, which was by your Grace only to be authorised for the great relief and succour of your subjects&#146;. The &#145;thing&#146; proposed in the manuscript was nothing less than a scheme of national insurance which would lead not only to the repair of broken bridges and coastal defences but also require the rich and noble to pay annual sums for the support of the indigent and sickly.<br>
<br>The attitude behind such proposals has its most conventionally literary expression in the morality play <span class="italic">All for Money</span> of 1578. In a series of tableaux or dialogues money is shown to destroy all possibility of moral conduct in learning, law, marriage, and priesthood. The section on learning is probably the most interesting: the character Learning With Money hopes to be both wealthy and learned, but he is soon put right by the properly penniless scholar Learning Without Money; Money Without Learning and Neither Money Nor Learning are, of course, doomed to damnation, the latter because &#145;God hath hardened his heart&#146;. The book culminates in the archetypal oppositions of Jesus against Judas and Lazarus against Dives. The eternal suffering of these money-sinners provides a warning for everyone.<br>
<br>Dives and Lazarus appear again in Lupton's last printed work, <span class="italic">A Dream of the Devil and Dives</span> (1584, republished 1615). Once again money is the issue. Lupton, on the premise that dreams are revelations of God's truth, describes how the dream of a dialogue between the devil and Dives reveals God's judgment of an England where the rich will not help the poor, lawyers cheat their clients, landlords rack rents, judges accept bribes, and soldiers kill their neighbours. The work ends with a vision of the apocalypse forecast by Regiomontanus for 1588.<br>
<br>Lupton's two contributions to religious controversy, <span class="italic">A Persuasion from Papistry</span> and <span class="italic">The Christian Against the Jesuit</span> (both 1581), belong to a central denominational controversy of the time. After two years as &#145;the Pope's Scholar&#146; in the Jesuit-controlled English College in Rome, John Nichols, a lapsed protestant clergyman, returned to England in 1581. Imprisoned in the Tower of London, he was persuaded to return to protestantism, and before the end of the year published a series of works proclaiming the errors and horrors of Rome. These writings were immediately contradicted and ridiculed by Father Robert Persons in <span class="italic">A Discovery of J. Nichols Minister Misrepresented a Jesuit</span>, incidentally dismissing Lupton's <span class="italic">Persuasion from Papistry</span> as a tissue of ignorant irrelevancies. Lupton's theological treatise does not, on the face of it, deal with the Nichols controversy, but its concern for a national church as the basis for a purified moral estate implies the correctness of Nichols's choice. In the manner of the time Lupton immediately countered Persons's attack in <span class="italic">The Christian Against the Jesuit</span>, narrowing his focus and sharpening the tone.<br>
<br>Lupton's concern for a national control of morals appears again in <span class="italic">Siuqila, Too Good to be True</span> (1580, 1581) but in a more secular mode, following the lead of More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>. An ideal community called Mauqsun (<i>nusquam</i>, nowhere) is described by one Omen (<i>nemo</i>, nobody) and contrasted with Ailgna (Anglia, England). In Mauqsun godliness is preserved by unrelenting surveillance and drastic punishment, so that English tolerance of backsliding is avoided. The second part or &#145;knitting up&#146; of <span class="italic">Siuqila</span> is sometimes cited as a possible source for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Thousand Notable Things of Sundry Sorts</span> (1579)&#151;a heterogeneous collection of folk remedies and witty sayings largely drawn from Renaissance encyclopaedias&#151;is Lupton's least moralistic work, and also his most popular one; it was kept continuously in print until the nineteenth century.<br>
