<span class="headword">Partridge, Sir  (John) Bernard</span>  (1861&#150;1945), <span class="occ">cartoonist and illustrator</span>, was born in London on 11 October 1861, the sixth child and third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21489/', "Richard Partridge FRS (1805&#150;1873)")</script> and his wife, Frances Janette (Fanny) Turner. His father was professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy and later president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21485/', "John Partridge (1789&#150;1872)")</script>, was portrait painter-extraordinary to Queen Victoria. He was educated at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, and later studied at the West London School of Art. For a brief period he worked as a stained-glass designer and as a decorator of church interiors. At about the same time he acted professionally under the name of Bernard Gould with Henry Irving and Johnston Forbes-Robertson. He also played the part of Sergius Saranoff in the first performance of <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span> by George Bernard Shaw in 1894. In 1897 he married Lydia Faith, the daughter of Edward Harvey. They had no children. He had joined the staff of <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1891 on the recommendation of George Du Maurier and served as junior cartoonist under Edward Linley Sambourne, succeeding him as second cartoonist in 1901 and as principal cartoonist in 1910. For some years he contributed chiefly joke and theatrical cartoons but in 1899, not without misgivings, he turned to political caricatures. His final political cartoon was published on 18 April 1945, so that his career in this area was almost as long as that of Sir John Tenniel while his years of service to the pages of <span class="italic">Punch</span> were still longer. Ninety-four years of <span class="italic">Punch</span> cartoons were covered by these two draughtsmen.<br>
<br>The influence of the theatre was frequently evident in Partridge's drawings, and he sometimes seemed to make his cartoons a stage on which he mounted any scene and setting whether tragic or comic, carefully delineated, and appropriately costumed. He used shading and often rendered the minutest details. He was perhaps less vivacious than Tenniel, but his secure draughtsmanship and his knowledge of historical periods and their right setting made almost any subject safe in his hands. A famous example, <span class="italic">Unconquerable</span>, of Kaiser Wilhelm II and Albert, King of the Belgians, published on 21 October 1914, shows his talent in depicting facial expressions. He seldom burlesqued his characters, though he could do so with considerable power when the occasion demanded: his general fidelity to truth saved him from the difficulty sometimes experienced by cartoonists when called upon to deal with tragic events, or to administer encouragement rather than rebuke. His likenesses were excellent, and he made regular use of a strong image drawn with academic correctness and a constant emphasis on symbolism. By the time of his death his style was decidedly old-fashioned in appearance, especially when compared to contemporaries such as David Low.<br>
<br>Partridge was probably at his best in heroic or grandiose scenes, and many of his cartoons during the first and second world wars were strikingly powerful, dignified and memorable. However, it is perhaps regrettable that his lively early book illustrations and social cartoons were overshadowed by his political drawings. Handsome and courteous, he was often spoken of by his colleagues as one of the last of the Victorians. He painted in oils, watercolours, and pastels and exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New English Art Club. He drew for many other magazines, including <span class="italic">Moonshine</span>, <span class="italic">Lady's Pictorial</span> and <span class="italic">The Sketch</span>. In 1925 he was knighted. Partridge died on 9 August 1945 at his home, 10 Holland Park Road, Kensington, London. His wife survived him. A collection of his drawings, <span class="italic">Mr. Punch's Personalities, 1926&#150;1929</span>, is in the National Portrait Gallery, Kensington, London, where there is also a self-portrait in chalk and wash on paper. There are drawings by him in several public collections, including the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Imperial War Museum, London, some municipal art galleries, and the University of Kent at Canterbury.<br>
