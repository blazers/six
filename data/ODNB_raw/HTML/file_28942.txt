<span class="headword">Webster,  Alexander</span>  (1707&#150;1784), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of <a name="cosubject_28942"></a><span class="headword">James Webster</span>  (1658/9&#150;1720), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, and his third wife, Agnes, daughter of Alexander Menzies of Culter in Lanarkshire. Alexander's father studied at St Andrews University but left the university without taking his MA degree. He joined the covenanters and was twice imprisoned for his religious opinions. In 1688 he was appointed Presbyterian minister of Liberton (near Edinburgh), and was translated first to Whitekirk in 1691 and then in 1693 to the collegiate church, Edinburgh, where he remained for the rest of his life. He gained some notoriety by opposing the union with England and by attempting to preserve orthodoxy in the Church of Scotland. James Webster was three times married, first to Margaret Keir (<i>d</i>. 1698), second to Mary Stewart, and finally, in September 1703, to Agnes Menzies. He died on 18 May 1720.<br>
<br>Alexander Webster attended the high school in Edinburgh. In 1733 he was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Haddington and was appointed assistant and successor to Allan Logan, minister of Culross, who died that September. In June 1737 he was translated to the Tolbooth Church, Edinburgh, where he became a popular preacher. In 1737 he married Mary Erskine (1715&#150;1766), the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Erskine and his third wife, Euphemia Cochrane. They had six sons and one daughter, Ann, who married Captain Eyre Robert Mingay in 1777. Webster's wife's elder sister, Euphemia, was the mother of James Boswell and Webster his uncle; he and his children formed an important part of Boswell's social circle and are frequently mentioned in Boswell's journals.<br>
<br>In the early 1740s Webster played a leading role in supporting the Cambuslang revival, a spiritual awakening which began in the parish of Cambuslang, near Glasgow, and spread through much of western and central Scotland. In 1742 he published an important pamphlet, <span class="italic">Divine influence the true spring of the extraordinary work of Cambuslang and other places in the west of Scotland</span>, in which he argued that the conversions were a result of the influence of the Holy Spirit. In the same year Webster prepared a scheme for a provision for the widows and children of the ministers of the Church of Scotland, which he presented to the general assembly. In 1743 an act of parliament enabled the general assembly to raise money and establish the fund. Although he was largely responsible for initiating the fund which provided annuities, the actuarial basis of the scheme was largely the work of a colleague who shared Webster's interest in mathematics and demography, the Revd Robert Wallace.<br>
<br>Webster is remembered as the author of an early and respected private census of Scotland. In 1755 Lord President Robert Dundas, upon the instigation of the government, commissioned Webster to obtain figures on the population of Scotland providing information in three main areas: an alphabetical list of parishes showing the extent, patrons, stipends, and population in each case; a list of shires in Scotland detailing parishes, ministers, population, and numbers of Roman Catholics and men able to fight; and an estimate of the age structure of Scottish subjects in yearly age groups. Because of Webster's position within the church, his initiation of the fund for widows, and the fact that he was acting on behalf of the government, parish ministers throughout Scotland complied with his requests for specific information. He published the results of his study in <span class="italic">An account of the number of people in Scotland in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five</span> (1755).<br>
<br>Webster was a leader of the popular party within the Church of Scotland in opposition to the more liberal faction, the moderates. He showed his conservative and evangelical stance in his sermon <span class="italic">Supernatural Religion the Only Sure Hope of Sinners</span>, preached on 12 January 1741 and published later that year in which he argued for divine revelation against the arguments raised by rationalists and deists. He was also a devoted Hanoverian. After the Jacobite defeat at the battle of Culloden he preached two sermons in the Tolbooth Church on the occasion of Thanksgiving, 23 June 1746, published later that year as <span class="italic">Heathens Professing Judaism, when the Fear of the Jews Fell upon them</span>, dedicated &#145;To all those whose concern for the Welfare of our Jerusalem, and Zeal for the British Israel, commenced Before the Battle of Culloden&#146;. Using <span class="roman">Esther</span> as his text, he compared the Jews' deliverance with Mordecai and Esther's rescue of the Jews from Hamon to the revolution of 1688 and the Hanoverian succession. By adopting the language of British liberty and by de-emphasizing the rhetoric of the covenant, Webster signalled a break with the orthodox Presbyterian past and &#145;set a pattern for the next generation of evangelical political preaching&#146;  (Landsman, 203). In 1748 Webster was appointed to serve as chaplain to Frederick, prince of Wales, and on 24 May 1753 he was elected moderator of the general assembly. On 24 November 1760, he obtained the degree of DD from Edinburgh University. In the following month he was a member of a deputation sent by the general assembly to present an address to George III on his succession to the throne. He retired from the Tolbooth Church and became administer of the widows' fund in 1771, when he was also made one of his majesty's chaplains in ordinary for Scotland.<br>
<br>Webster was a convivial companion who loved his claret, a fondness for which earned him the nickname Dr Bonum Magnum. In 1773, when Samuel Johnson visited Scotland, Boswell noted in his journal:<blockquote>At supper we had Dr. Alexander Webster, who, though not learned, had such a knowledge of mankind, such a fund of information and entertainment, so clear a head and such accommodating manners, that Dr. Johnson found him a very agreeable companion. (<span class="italic">Boswell's Tour</span>, 32)</blockquote>Webster died on 25 January 1784 in his home at the foot of Webster's Close on the south side of Castle Hill, Edinburgh, leaving his property to his daughter Ann and her children, even though two of his sons were still living. He was buried in the city's Greyfriars churchyard.<br>
