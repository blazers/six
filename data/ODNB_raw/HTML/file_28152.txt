<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the son and heir of a Shropshire or Herefordshire family, and entered Shrewsbury School on 30 January 1596. He learned his military skills in Europe, and in 1620 may have served as a captain in Lord Cromwell's regiment of foot, raised for Mansfeld's expedition to the Netherlands. By 27 July 1639 he had decided to serve the king in the bishops' wars, and late in 1641 he led a troop in the earl of Carnarvon's regiment of horse, sent to Ireland to help suppress the October rebellion. After commanding Sir Richard Grenvile's cavalry at Rathconnell (7 February 1643) he carried news of the victory to Dublin, and was knighted by the marquess of Ormond.<br>
<br>Vaughan was made a colonel, and, in charge of over 300 horse, part of a large body of reinforcements sent by Ormond to relieve Chester, he joined Lord Byron's forces there early in February 1644, and played an important role in Shropshire and north Wales for the remainder of the war. He helped Colonel Robert Ellice capture Apley Castle, Shropshire (24 March 1644), and rout Thomas Mytton at Longford the following day. His regiment then joined Prince Rupert's army, and Vaughan was probably at the storming of Bolton on 28 May and the siege of Liverpool (7&#150;12 June). He served with Byron on the royalist right wing at Marston Moor on 2 July, and was with him in the disastrous rout at Montgomery on 18 September. Byron complained of how little Vaughan contributed to the action; but, earlier in the month, Vaughan and Sir Michael Erneley had broken Sir Thomas Myddleton's army there, before settling down to besiege the castle. On 28 September he garrisoned Shrawardine Castle in Shropshire, of which he had been appointed governor, but two weeks later, on 13 October, he was taken prisoner by Mytton while on his knees receiving communion in Shrawardine church. Allowed back into the castle, on the pretext of persuading it to surrender, he failed to re-emerge, and within a fortnight defeated Sir John Price at Welshpool.<br>
<br>During the winter Vaughan was made general of Shropshire. He had put his troops into garrisons all over the county&#151;at Dawley House, Lilleshall Abbey, Caws Castle, Leigh Hall, and High Ercall&#151;with his parson brother commanding Shrawardine itself. Unscrupulously living off the country and confiscating the property of local parliamentarians, the best-documented example being his robbery from the drapers of Dolgellau of &pound;140 and sundry cloths (27 November 1644), Vaughan acquired the sobriquet &#145;the Devil of Shrawardine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 1 Feb 1644). But his actions were effective: he cut off Myddleton from his Shropshire colleagues, and ensured that his men were well paid, clothed, and housed; and his regiment emerged from winter quarters 400 strong, a number rivalling Rupert's own regiment, usually the strongest in the royalist army. During the early 1640s Vaughan was a member of the close circle of Thomas Chaloner, headmaster of Shrewsbury School, who met regularly at The Sextry inn in the town.<br>
<br>After being defeated and captured by Cromwell at Bampton, Oxfordshire (27 April 1645), Vaughan was soon exchanged, and he beat off some Shropshire horse near Wenlock on 9 May before joining the king eight days later on his march from Oxford to Chester. He was present at the storming of Leicester (30 May); and at Naseby (14 June), in the second line of the royalist right wing, he participated in the great charge which pierced Ireton's opposing troops. After the defeat he fell back on Shropshire, where local clubmen in the south-west of the county were withholding supplies from the royalist garrisons, and the parliamentarian forces had captured Caws and Shrawardine (24&#150;5 June) and were besieging High Ercall.<br>
<br>Vaughan defeated his opponents at Broncroft Castle (4 July) and the following day relieved High Ercall, capturing nearly 400 prisoners, whom he used to help ransom royalist foot taken at Naseby. He joined the king at Ludlow on 7 August, and was with him at Doncaster (19 August) and Huntingdon (23 August). Towards the end of the month Vaughan burnt Bishop's Castle, and he was present at the defeat at Rowton Heath (24 September). After accompanying the king to Newark, in October he was appointed general of the horse in Wales and the marches, and promised to continue provisioning Chester from north Wales. He defeated Sydenham Poyntz at Drayton in mid-October, and managed to get a supply of brimstone into Chester before being crushed by Michael Jones and Mytton, with a much larger force, at Denbigh on 1 November, while he waited for the Caernarvonshire levies to arrive. Vaughan's routed cavalry retreated to Knighton, Radnorshire, where they broke up on 13 November. He found temporary quarters at Leominster, but was then forced back on Worcester. Early in December he was ordered to renew the attempt to relieve Chester, but each time he managed to weld together his troops in Herefordshire and Shropshire for the task, strong sallies by Jones or Mytton scattered them, and he was denied admittance to Ludlow.<br>
<br>On 9 December Vaughan was reported to be quartered between Bridgnorth and Bewdley with 1000 men; after burning the village of Wrockwardine, Vaughan again relieved High Ercall, and in January 1646 joined Lord Astley at Bridgnorth in the frustrated hope of amalgamating with Lord St Paul's Welsh troops in a further assault on Chester. Instead he retreated with Astley to Worcester, and finally abandoned the attempt on 29 January. February saw Vaughan engaged in further raids in the marches, especially at Clun, Presteigne, and Leintwardine, and at the end of the month he plundered Richard Jones of Tre-wern, Radnorshire, of over &pound;400 and the very rings from his wife's fingers. Early in March he rejoined Astley, and he was with him when the royalist forces were comprehensively defeated by Sir William Brereton at Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, on 21 March.<br>
<br>Vaughan, though wounded, escaped capture and made his way to The Hague, where in November 1648 Rupert gave him command of a ship, in which he seems to have crossed over to Ireland. He became major-general of horse under Ormond. When, at Rathmines on 2 August 1649, Michael Jones surprised the royalists, Vaughan led the counter-charge, only to be killed fighting bravely at the head of his men. On 8 October 1651, leave to compound for his estates was granted to Charles Vaughan, his administrator. Vaughan's main overall achievement was, in every adversity, to keep his regiment of horse up to strength; in this regard no royalist commander achieved more, and the spectres of his cavalrymen are rumoured still to canter across the Shropshire countryside.<br>
