<span class="headword">Blaugdone,  Barbara</span>  (<em>c.</em>1609&#150;1704), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was &#145;a Woman of good Parts and Education&#146;  (Besse, 2.37) and well connected. Her husband, about whom nothing is known, probably died young, leaving her a widow with a small income which she supplemented by teaching. She was converted to Quakerism in 1654 by John Audland and John Camm. Of her earlier life it is known only that she &#145;feared the Lord&#146; and &#145;sought&#146; him &#145;earnestly&#146;  (Blaugdone, 5). She may have been one of the Bristol Seekers from whom many Quakers at this time were recruited. After conversion, to &#145;subdue her body&#146;, she abstained for a year &#145;from all Flesh, Wine and Beer&#146;, drinking only water  (ibid., 9). &#145;She became plain both in speech and habit&#146;, alienating her employers and losing her pupils  (Sewel, 1.252).<br>
<br>For entering churches in Bristol &#145;to bear testimony against their formalities&#146;, Blaugdone was imprisoned for three months in 1654  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On leaving a meeting at a private house she was stabbed, narrowly escaping death. To gain the release from prison of two Quaker preachers, she went to Basingstoke. Denied access to them, she successfully pleaded their cause with the mayor. In 1656, when several Quakers were imprisoned in Ireland, she felt called to continue their mission and sailed for Cork. A storm forced her boat into Dublin, where she met the deputy, Henry Cromwell (second son of the lord protector), and cautioned him about his treatment of Quakers. She left him &#145;much troubled and &hellip; melancholy&#146;  (Besse, 2.459). In Cork her religious enthusiasm and the power of her preaching alarmed friends. She was accused of witchcraft and imprisoned. A letter to George Fox told of a call to Jerusalem, but she was dissuaded and on release went home. Shortly afterwards she was back in Dublin, exhorting judges in the court of justice to righteousness. Again imprisoned, &#145;she suffered much&#146;  (Sewel, 1.308). Only the intervention of powerful friends obtained her release. She went to Limerick, was imprisoned, and moved to Cork and Kinsale gaols before being released and banished.<br>
<br>In 1657 in Marlborough, Blaugdone attempted to speak in the church following the service, was attacked, brought before a magistrate, and imprisoned for six weeks, during which she fasted six days. On release she went to the mayor and so powerful were her reproaches that he &#145;acknowledged the truth of her doctrine&#146; and henceforth attempted to protect Quakers  (Brailsford, 169). She visited Molton, Barnstaple, and Bideford in the west country &#145;in all which places a Prison was her Lot&#146;  (Sewel, 1.253). For bearing witness in Great Torrington she was sent to Exeter prison, long detained before trial, and finally &#145;whipt till the Blood ran down my back&#146;  (Brailsford, 172). After the Restoration she remained active. The year 1681 found her in prison in Bristol for attending a Quaker meeting. Two years later in Ilchester, Somerset, she was again imprisoned, and in the same year she was fined &pound;280 for failing to attend the local Anglican church. In 1686 she wrote to James II about the continued imprisonment of many Quakers. Her memoirs, published in 1691 but almost certainly circulated privately long before, end in 1657. In 1689 two other writings intended for publication were censored. She died in London in 1704.<br>
