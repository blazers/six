<span class="headword">Pouncy,  Benjamin Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">draughtsman and engraver</span>, may have studied engraving with his father, Edward Pouncy. He was certainly a pupil of William Woollett, and is said (in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of 1799) to have been his brother-in-law; his wife's name was Ann. Pouncy's place and date of birth are unknown but the evidence of his work and a portrait of him by Henry Edridge in the British Museum indicate a birth date of about 1750. He was one of a group of London-based artists with Kentish associations which included Woollett, Thomas Hearne, William Alexander, and Edridge.<br>
<br>Pouncy has been described as &#145;a feeble draughtsman&#146;  (Grant, 163), but his topographical watercolours are of a high quality. Among a number of Kentish views shown by him at the Society of Artists and Royal Academy exhibitions between 1772 and 1789 was <span class="italic">The Gate of Dandelion, Near Margate</span> (exh. RA, 1788), a subject also drawn by Alexander, Edridge, and the young Turner. Pouncy's picture is most probably the watercolour exhibited as <span class="italic">A Haycart Approaching a Castle Gateway</span> in London in 1978 at Agnew's annual exhibition of watercolours and drawings. A group of watercolours by him is in the collection of the Kent Archaeological Society, and there are good examples in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. A large <span class="italic">View of Margate Harbour</span> in the British Museum shows him to have been a highly accomplished master of the gentle pencil, pen, and watercolour wash technique so popular with topographical artists towards the end of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>As a printmaker Pouncy produced large reproductive plates imitative of the style of Woollett, plates to illustrate a number of antiquarian and travel books, and some etchings and engravings after his own designs. The large plates are of classical, landscape, and seascape themes after such artists as Richard Wilson, Solomon Delane, and Robert Cleveley. His technique of overlaying line engraving on an etched design is identical to Woollett's, and several plates, such as an <span class="italic">Apollo and the Seasons</span> (1777), after Wilson and John Hamilton Mortimer (held in the British Museum), are collaborative enterprises, Pouncy having engraved the landscape and Woollett the figures. In the 1770s Pouncy formed a link with Lambeth and provided architectural and archaeological illustrations for the historian Andrew Coltee Ducarel, the librarian at Lambeth Palace. One of his earliest Lambeth works is his illustration of the <span class="italic">Monument of John Tradescant</span> in St Mary's churchyard, dated 1773, for John Nichols's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span> (1782&#150;8). After this date he worked regularly for Ducarel, although he did not live in Lambeth until 1780 and it is not clear whether he was ever employed as a member of staff at Lambeth Palace Library.<br>
<br>Pouncy's steady hand and keen eye for detail were also well employed in the production of facsimile illustrations&#151;some of his copies of medieval manuscripts for Thomas Astle's <span class="italic">The Origin and Progress of Writing</span> (1784) being of exceptional quality. Towards the end of his life he engraved some of the finest plates to Sir George Staunton's <span class="italic">An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China</span> (1797), after drawings by William Alexander. The engraver and watercolourist Joseph Powell (<i>fl</i>. 1796&#150;1833) gave his address &#145;At Mr Pouncey's, Pratt Street, Lambeth&#146; in 1797, and may therefore have been a pupil of the artist. Pouncy died at this address on 22 August 1799 and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Lambeth. Witnesses to his will were Joseph Powell and Elizabeth Woollett.<br>
