<span class="headword">Holbrook <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jackson]</span>,  Ann Catherine</span>  (1780&#150;1837), <span class="occ">actress and author</span>, was probably born in London. Her father, Thomas Jackson, was an actor, and she was brought up to that profession. Before she was eighteen she played with success such characters as Juliet, Roxana, and Alicia. Her mother died in 1794 and her father at Norwich in 1798. On his deathbed he commended her to his own manager, John Brunton, of the Colchester theatre, who failed to fulfil this last request. She then went to London to seek work on the stage through a theatrical &#145;register-office&#146; in Russell Court, which referred her to a provincial company at Lewes in Sussex. Three months later, in Battle, Sussex, she married a man named Holbrook who was an actor with the same company. They acted together with various provincial companies in such towns as Taunton, Preston, and Lancaster, where &#145;the noble ladies&#146; made her a liberal present. They then tried engagements in Cheltenham, where the countess of Kenmare attended their benefit, in Windsor, and in Daventry, where there was a fire in the theatre. An engagement with W. C. Macready in the midlands followed during which they hoped to earn more for the support of their children, but they soon left the stage, disillusioned with the &#145;nine years of misery&#146; produced by the general conditions they had encountered in the theatre and with management in particular. Ann Holbrook then turned to writing, and produced in 1809 <span class="italic">The Dramatist, or, Memoirs of the Stage, with the Life of the Authoress</span>. A large part of this small book, subscribed to by nine members of the aristocracy among numerous others, is devoted to the financial difficulties of life as an actor and the insensitive treatment by management, which she hoped might prove a deterrent to others wishing to enter the profession. She did not hesitate to recount anecdotes against herself, such as a description of a time when she lost her wig on the stage, to the embarrassment of cast and audience. She continued to write, producing <span class="italic">Tales, Serious and Instructive</span> in 1821, <span class="italic">Constantine Castriot, an Historical Tale</span> in 1829, and <span class="italic">Realities and Reflections: a Series of Original Tales</span> in 1834. She died in London in January 1837.<br>
