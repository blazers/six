<span class="headword">Lynch,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1677), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Galway to an ancient family of the city. Neither his father's nor his mother's name is known; the often-stated suggestion that his father was the Alexander Lynch who had a school in Galway in 1608 has been shown to have no basis. Having received part of his early tuition from the Jesuits, he was sent to France in 1618 to further his education. Apparently bound for Rouen, he was persuaded by fellow Galwayman Francis Kirwan (who may also have been related to him) to go instead to the Jesuit college of Dieppe where Kirwan was a professor. He later spent a period in the Jesuit college of Douai before moving to Rouen, where he stayed from 1621 to 1624. During his time in France his fellow students included men who were later to be leading members of the Irish hierarchy.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland, Lynch was ordained priest early in 1625 and within a couple of years was appointed chaplain to Sir Richard Blake, who was mayor of Galway in 1627&#150;8. In or about 1630 he was appointed archdeacon of Tuam. There remain only some minor details from his own hand of his ecclesiastical activities over the following decade or so, but his intellectual interests are reflected in his commissioning in 1643 of the Irish scholar and scribe Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh to copy a fragmentary collection of early Irish annals from a manuscript belonging to the learned family of MacEgan.<br>
<br>Lynch attained a degree of prominence and even notoriety during the tumultuous decade which followed the outbreak of the Irish rising of autumn 1641. He and his old mentor, Francis Kirwan, now bishop of Killala, as firm supporters of the leading Galway Catholic magnate, Ulick Bourke, marquess of Clanricarde, were closely identified with the Old English party. This brought them into direct conflict with the Italian papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, archbishop of Fermo. The latter's machinations during his sojourn in Ireland in 1645&#150;9 split the Catholic confederate camp and the Irish hierarchy. When in summer 1651 Galway city was invested by the Cromwellian army of Sir Charles Coote, Lynch was one of a small minority of the clergy which favoured surrendering on terms; and his few like-minded colleagues were consequently reviled as &#145;anti divines and pseudo preachers&#146;  (J. T. Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary History of Affairs in Ireland</span>, 2, 1879, 71). After a nine-month siege and with famine looming, the city was suddenly surrendered. Although the terms were quite generous, little leniency was shown to the Catholic clergy: they were obliged to leave Ireland within six months. Even a moderate such as Lynch was not spared and before the end of 1652 he went into exile in France. He appears to have settled in or near the town of St Malo in Brittany, and there he spent the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Lynch was far from idle during his exile. He spent several years researching and writing a number of major works, some of which appeared in print during his lifetime. The best-known of these was <span class="italic">Cambrensis eversus</span>, which was largely written in the 1650s and published under the <i>nom de plume</i> Gratianus Lucius in 1662, probably at St Malo. This learned refutation of the perceived anti-Irish slanders of the twelfth-century Cambro-Norman ecclesiastic and propagandist Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) is combined with a cleverly persuasive defence of the Old English cause in the wars of the mid-seventeenth century. It also contains much evidence of Gaelic learning&#151;particularly in relation to genealogical material, some of which was probably supplied by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh. The next work of Lynch's to appear was <span class="italic">Alithinologia, sive, Veridica responsio ad invectivam</span> which was issued under the <i>nom de plume</i> Eudoxius Alithinologus in 1664, probably at St Omer. This book, together with a further volume entitled <span class="italic">Supplementum alithinologiae</span>, published in 1667, powerfully and skilfully argues the Old English case against the pro-Rinuccini faction in Rome. The only other work of Lynch's to appear in print during his lifetime was a life of his friend and former teacher Kirwan, who had died in Rennes in 1661; this little book, entitled <span class="italic">Pii antistitis icon</span>, was published in 1669.<br>
<br>Lynch's most ambitious work, his voluminous history of the Irish bishops, <span class="italic">De praesulibus Hiberniae</span>, arranged on a diocesan basis and filling 1081 manuscript pages, was completed towards the end of 1672. Marshalling as it does an impressive array of source material, in both Irish and Latin, it must have taken several years of painstaking and onerous research work to compile. Lynch says that he wrote for relevant information to the person in charge of each Irish diocese, with very mixed results. He did not, however, live to see the work in print; it was finally published in 1944 in two large volumes. Another work of his which did not appear in his lifetime (it was published in 1846) was a Latin poem dating from 1667 in which he explains that he cannot return to his native land while a certain person (probably Charles Coote, president of Connaught) was still in power. A letter which he wrote about 1664 to a French scholar, M. du Boulay, correcting his linking of the terms &#145;Scotia&#146; and &#145;Scoti&#146; to medieval Scotland rather than to Ireland, was printed by Charles O'Conor as an appendix to his edition of Roderic O'Flaherty's <span class="italic">Ogygia Vindicated</span> (1775). One other work of Lynch's which has never appeared in print is a translation into &#145;elegant Latin&#146; of Geoffrey Keating's history of Ireland (<span class="italic">Foras feasa ar &Eacute;irinn</span>). It has been suggested that this was completed before Lynch left Ireland in 1652.<br>
<br>The date of Lynch's death is uncertain. Most authorities suggest that he died in either 1673 or 1674, but evidence has been adduced that he was still alive in 1677. While it has been suggested that he may have spent his final years in Paris, it seems more likely that he passed away in St Malo, where he had lived for a quarter of a century.<br>
