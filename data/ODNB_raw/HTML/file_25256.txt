<span class="headword">Shaw,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1789&#150;1815), <span class="occ">pugilist and soldier</span>, was born on a farm between the villages of Cossall and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire, the son of William Shaw, farmer. Educated at Trowell Moor school, he was a delicate child, but grew to be a powerfully built young man. After being apprenticed to a wheelwright in Radford, Nottinghamshire, in 1802, he then became a carpenter at Wollaton Hall, home of Lord Middleton. He achieved fame as a boxer, and fought one match at which Jem Belcher, the veteran prize-fighter, was present, before enlisting in the 2nd Life Guards at Nottingham goose fair on 16 October 1807. Shaw showed particular aptitude as a soldier and gained a certain notoriety in his regiment by engaging in a street brawl near Portman Square, London, in which he defeated three toughs who taunted him for his red coat. After subsequently being introduced by his officers to the prize-fighting &eacute;lite at the fives court in Little St Martin Lane, London, and to Jackson's Rooms, a fashionable club and boxing school in Bond Street, Shaw fought and defeated James Molyneaux, the American boxer, in a &#145;friendly&#146; match (with gloves). Soon afterwards he outpaced and beat Captain Robert Barclay of the 23rd regiment, known for his devastating punches.<br>
<br>Jack Shaw's reputation as a fighter was established, despite a defeat by Tom Belcher, brother of Jem, and in July 1812 he outfought a Mr Burrows in his first bare-knuckle contest, in which he forced his opponent to retire in less than seventeen minutes. In April 1815, having issued a challenge to all England, he was matched against Ned Painter, whose second was the famed boxer Tom Cribb, on Hounslow Heath and beat his opponent ruthlessly with ten successive knock-down blows in twenty-eight minutes. Shaw apparently intended to challenge Cribb for the England championship title but before this happened the 2nd Life Guards were ordered to join Wellington's army in the south Netherlands as the crisis deepened following Napoleon's escape from Elba.<br>
<br>Now a corporal, Shaw was in charge of a foraging party early in the morning of 18 June 1815, when his troop was recalled to take its place with the regiment on the slopes above La Haye-Sainte at Waterloo. He took a conspicuous part in the numerous charges the 2nd Life Guards made that day as a part of the household brigade under Lord Edward Somerset, and was seen powerfully striking with his sword, causing terrible carnage among the French cavalrymen with whom he engaged. His energy and bravery were of the highest order, although reports that he captured a French eagle standard are contradictory and may be an exaggeration. Tom Morris of the 73rd regiment, who watched Shaw in action, noted that he had been drinking gin before the action began, and felt that he would have done better to attend more closely to the ordering of his troop. At last, venturing forward to the aid of Captain Edward Kelly of his regiment, Shaw was isolated from his comrades by French cuirassiers and his sword broke in his hand. Striking fiercely about him with his helmet, he was eventually unhorsed and cut down by his opponents, receiving numerous wounds. Shaw was seen later that night, lying dreadfully injured on a midden near La Haye-Sainte, and in the morning his lifeless body was buried nearby; Sergeant-Major Edward Cotton, later proprietor of the Waterloo Museum, was one of the burial party.<br>
<br>Shaw's body was later exhumed and returned to Britain at the instigation of Sir Walter Scott, who had met him in the studio of the artist Benjamin Haydon, where Shaw posed as a model. A cast of his skull is in the Household Cavalry Museum in Windsor. Jack Shaw was a tall man, said to be 6 feet &frac12; inch tall and weighing 15 stone on entering the army. Noted for his very powerful physique and great strength, he was a brave and pugnacious boxer, and a skilful rider and swordsman. Although his fame faded after Waterloo, a memorial to those men of the village of Cossall who fought in the battle, including Shaw, was erected in 1877 in the parish churchyard.<br>
