<span class="headword">Pitcairn,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1584), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of David Pitcairn of Airdrie, a barony belonging to the Lumsden family in Fife, and his wife, Elizabeth Durie. He married Euphemia Murray (<i>d</i>. 1596), daughter of Sir William Murray of Tullibardine. On his mother's side Robert Pitcairn had very influential church connections, and when in 1561 he became commendator of Dunfermline it was in succession to George Durie, the last pre-Reformation abbot, who was also archdeacon of St Andrews, keeper of the privy seal, and brother to Andrew Durie, bishop of Galloway. Pitcairn himself had been educated for a career in the church, and he now found himself in the enviable position of possessing a quasi-hereditary sinecure which gave him access to the substantial resources of one of Scotland's major abbeys. All this, moreover, without having to perform any religious duties. He was obviously ambitious, however, and the commendatorship was to be the stepping stone to greater things. By 1568 he had become a privy councillor and extraordinary lord of session, and in that year he was also a member of the commission which accompanied the earl of Moray to York, and subsequently London, to attend Queen Elizabeth's enquiry into Queen Mary's conduct. This was to be the first of a number of visits which Pitcairn made to England in the following years. In September 1569, for instance, he was in London reassuring Elizabeth of Moray's opposition to schemes for the marriage of Mary and the duke of Norfolk, and in the following May he formed part of a mission seeking both English assistance against Mary's supporters and advice concerning a replacement as regent for the earl of Moray, assassinated on 23 January 1570. Elizabeth recommended the earl of Lennox, father of Darnley, and a choice totally unacceptable to the current secretary, the powerful and influential William Maitland of Lethington. It was the latter's resignation in July 1570 which enabled Pitcairn to succeed him as secretary.<br>
<br>In his new office Pitcairn inevitably participated in the principal events of the 1570s and early 1580s. Thus during the year which followed November 1571 he was called upon to undertake three further diplomatic missions to England, in all of which he and his colleagues sought to justify the actions of the king's party in their struggle against the followers of Queen Mary, while also hoping to obtain English military assistance. In October 1572, shortly before the earl of Morton became regent, Pitcairn was involved in negotiations with Sir Henry Killigrew, the English ambassador, over the possibility of Mary being returned and her fate decided by the Scottish government, but the stability of Morton's regency largely meant a return to more mundane matters. Consequently the secretary's time (as his regular attendance at the privy council confirms) was largely taken up with the daily routine of administration. None the less, in February 1573 he took part in the discussions which resulted in the pacification of Perth, whereby the Hamilton and Gordon families gave their recognition to James VI's government. In August 1574 he accompanied the regent on his judicial expedition to Aberdeen, while in September 1575, acting as a border commissioner, Pitcairn was a signatory to the agreement which ended the frontier dispute with England resulting from the so-called Redeswyre incident.<br>
<br>Pitcairn's last embassy to the queen of England occurred in June 1578, when Morton, who had recovered his position within Scotland, sent his secretary on a mission whose agenda, although it also included such issues as piracy, the condition of the borders, and James VI's claims to the estate of the countess of Lennox, had as its principal objective &#145;the ratification and confirmation of the peace and amity contracted in the first year of her reign&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, 300). He was given a cordial reception by Elizabeth and was later described as having &#145;truly, honestly and diligently performed and discharged this charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1578&#150;85, 23), but Pitcairn was unable to persuade the English queen to consider an alliance and he returned empty-handed.<br>
<br>Pitcairn's final years in office were principally concerned with domestic matters, for instance, with the negotiations with the Argyll&#150;Atholl faction in October 1578 which finally resolved their dispute with Morton; with the vexed question of the earldom of Lennox which the king, as the thirteenth earl's paternal grandson, sought to possess and which he ultimately bestowed on his kinsman Esm&eacute; Stewart; with the problem of finding a solution to the long-standing feud in north-east Scotland between the Forbeses and the Gordons.<br>
<br>In his political alignments Pitcairn acted astutely for much of his career. Originally an adherent of the earl of Moray, on the latter's death in 1570 he transferred his support to the earl of Morton, Moray's obvious successor as leader of the king's party. By 1578 his allegiance to the regent was reputedly wavering, and by 1580 observers like Sir Robert Bowes, the English ambassador, were noting the secretary's backing for Morton's great rival, the earl of Lennox. But when he changed sides again in 1582 and aligned himself against Lennox with the faction known as the Ruthven raiders Pitcairn made a disastrous miscalculation which eventually cost him his job. He benefited in the short term, receiving a treasury appointment from the first earl of Gowrie in April 1583, but the latter was unable to prevent a counter-revolution in the following year which not only brought about his own downfall but also ended Pitcairn's secretaryship. Rather pathetic attempts at bribery in an effort to retain his position only resulted in temporary imprisonment in Lochleven Castle, and in May 1584 John Maitland of Thirlestane replaced him as secretary. As Pitcairn and his wife had no children, shortly before his death he transferred the abbacy of Dunfermline to his nephew, Henry Pitcairn, who ultimately inherited it. Pitcairn died on 18 October 1584 at his home, Limekilns, near Dunfermline, and was buried in the north aisle of Dunfermline church, in close proximity to his predecessor George Durie, the last abbot of Dunfermline.<br>
<br>Pitcairn's epitaph commemorates him as &#145;the hope and pillar of his country&#146;, but this would seem to be an overestimate of his achievements. Actively involved in the nation's affairs both before and during his secretaryship, he differed from the two Maitlands who preceded and succeeded him in that office in that he contributed little to the formation of policy and the taking of important decisions. A competent and conscientious civil servant, highly regarded as such, Pitcairn was essentially a figure of secondary importance during James VI's minority.<br>
