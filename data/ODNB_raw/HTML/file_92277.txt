<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Welch <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Welsh]</span>,  Elisabeth Margaret</span>  (1904&#150;2003), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was born on 27 February 1904 at West 61st Street, New York. Her father, John Wesley Welsh, was born in Havre de Grace, Harford, Maryland, about 1860, of mixed African-American and American Indian ancestry (his mother came from the Lenape tribe in Wilmington, Delaware). At the time of her birth he was the head gardener and coachman on a large estate in Englewood, New Jersey. Her mother, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kay, was born in Leith, Edinburgh, in 1872 of Scottish and Irish ancestry. She had travelled to the United States in 1898 to work as an assistant to the nanny of the family that Welsh worked for in Englewood. Welsh and Kay were married in New York on 18 October 1902, a few months after Elisabeth's elder brother, Edward (1902&#150;1979), was born. Elisabeth also had a younger brother, John (1906&#150;1999), and the family lived in a racially mixed neighbourhood. She later said: &#145;I never had any feeling about being different from anybody else. It equipped me to be an international person all my life&#146;  (Bourne, 3).<br>
<br>Elisabeth Welsh was educated at public school 69 and Julia Richman High School, both in New York. As a youngster she attended St Cyprian's, a local Episcopalian church and community centre. It was there that she started singing in the church choir at the age of eight and became known as &#145;the loud alto&#146; because of her strong voice. As a choir member she found herself drawn into musical theatre and throughout the 1920s she appeared in a succession of black Broadway shows at the height of the jazz age. After making her d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Liza</span> in 1922, the &#145;loud alto&#146; was pulled out of the choir to introduce the song &#145;Charleston&#146; in <span class="italic">Runnin' Wild</span> the following year, thus launching the famous dance craze. On 26 February 1924 she married the jazz musician Luke Smith in New York. His brother, Joe, a cornet player, often accompanied the blues legends Bessie Smith (no relation) and Ethel Waters. However, the marriage was short-lived. By the time Welsh turned professional (and changed her surname from Welsh to Welch) in 1928 the couple had separated, and Smith died on 20 June 1936.<br>
<br>Welch acknowledged her professional stage d&eacute;but as Lew Leslie's hit Broadway revue <span class="italic">Blackbirds of 1928</span>, starring Adelaide Hall and Bill &#145;Bojangles&#146; Robinson. Welch sang with Cecil Mack's Choir in the show, and understudied various leading ladies, including Hall and Aida Ward. In 1929 she travelled with the cast of <span class="italic">Blackbirds</span> to Paris, where they became a hit at the Moulin Rouge. The following year she returned to Paris to launch her cabaret career, singing in the original Boeuf sur le Toit and Le Grand Ecart&#151;two smart cocktail and dinner clubs designed by Jean Cocteau. Later that year, during a cabaret engagement in New York, she was asked to replace the singer of Cole Porter's &#145;Love for Sale&#146; in the Broadway revue <span class="italic">The New Yorkers</span>. For Welch &#145;Love for Sale&#146;, a prostitute's lament, was &#145;beautiful poetry because it was like one of the street cries of London&#146;  (Bourne, 23).<br>
<br>On her return to Paris, Welch met Porter, who cast her in <span class="italic">Nymph Errant</span>, a musical extravaganza starring Gertrude Lawrence which opened in London in October 1933. Welch stopped the show with Porter's &#145;Solomon&#146;. Prior to this appearance, she made her London d&eacute;but in the summer of 1933 in a revue called <span class="italic">Dark Doings</span>, in which she introduced the classic song &#145;Stormy Weather&#146; to Britain. Other career highlights of the 1930s included appearances at the London Palladium with Cab Calloway (1934); at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in Ivor Novello's musical <span class="italic">Glamorous Night</span> (1935); and at Blackpool's Opera House in the revue <span class="italic">All the Best</span> (1938), as well as in many cabaret shows, including a successful run at the Caf&eacute; de Paris. From 1934 to 1936 she broadcast in her own BBC radio series, <span class="italic">Soft Lights and Sweet Music</span>. Also for the BBC, in 1936, she began making television appearances when the corporation launched the first high-definition television service. Early programmes were transmitted live from the Alexandra Palace studios in north London. Welch later said, &#145;Television was born, and I was in at the birth!&#146;  (Bourne, 37). In addition to several guest appearances in films, in 1936 she co-starred with the African-American actor and singer Paul Robeson in <span class="italic">Song of Freedom</span>, a melodrama with songs. She recalled:<blockquote>he [Robeson] tried to persuade me to do something for our people. I had to answer. I'm of mixed blood&#151;African, American Indian, Scots, and Irish. So I said: &#145;Paul, I belong to <i>four</i> peoples! I can't make a stand for all of them. You must excuse me!&#146; (Bourne, 47)</blockquote>When the Second World War broke out, Welch, who could have returned to the safety of New York, decided to stay in London and continue her career. In addition to stage, film, and radio work, she entertained the troops at army and Royal Air Force camps all over the country. In 1942 she travelled to Gibraltar with an all-star company that included John Gielgud, Edith Evans, and Beatrice Lillie, in a special &#145;concert party&#146; for the troops stationed there. Her relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76549/', "David Astor (1912&#150;2001)")</script> ended during the war when his formidable mother, Nancy, Lady Astor, the American-English tory politician, expressed strong disapproval of her son's interracial affair. Much later, in 1987, Welch accepted an invitation to attend and sing for David Astor and his guests at his seventy-fifth birthday celebration at the Waldorf Hotel.<br>
<br>After the war Welch reigned supreme in London's West End in three sophisticated revues: <span class="italic">Tuppence Coloured</span> (1947), in which she introduced Edith Piaf's &#145;La vie en rose&#146; to the British public, <span class="italic">Oranges and Lemons</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">Penny Plain</span> (1951). Other post-war career highlights included West End triumphs in the musicals <span class="italic">The Crooked Mile</span> (1959), <span class="italic">Cindy-Ella</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">Pippin</span> (1973), and in 1964 there was a leading role in <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Nellie Brown</span>, an original television musical, specially written for her by Robert Gould. In 1969, on the occasion of No&euml;l Coward's seventieth birthday, she took part in <span class="italic">A Talent to Amuse</span>, an all-star tribute at the Phoenix Theatre, and in 1970 she began a long succession of one-woman shows with <span class="italic">A Marvellous Party</span> at the Hampstead Theatre Club, which continued into the 1990s. When she appeared as a Goddess in Derek Jarman's imaginative 1979 screen version of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>&#151;singing &#145;Stormy Weather&#146; to a group of handsome young sailors&#151;the writer and jazz singer George Melly described it as &#145;arguably the campest, most sparkling moment in the history of cinema&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 13 May 1989).<br>
<br>In 1985 Welch won rave reviews and a nomination for a Laurence Olivier award for her performance in the revue <span class="italic">Jerome Goes to Hollywood</span>, a celebration of the work of the composer Jerome Kern, at the Donmar Warehouse. She received more praise from the critics, as well as a Tony nomination, when the renamed <span class="italic">Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood</span> transferred to Broadway in January 1986. Frank Rich wrote in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> (24 Jan 1986): &#145;We must write letters to our Congressmen demanding that Elisabeth Welch be detained in the United States forthwith as a national resource too rare and precious for export.&#146; In 1985 she took part in her second royal variety performance and was the subject of Thames Television's <span class="italic">This is Your Life</span>. In 1987 a documentary film, <span class="italic">Keeping Love Alive</span>, described as a &#145;self-portrait in words and songs&#146;, captured her live performance at London's Almeida Theatre, and this was screened at various international film festivals. Perhaps the crowning achievement of her long and illustrious career was the 1992 all-star tribute concert, <span class="italic">A Time to Start Living: a Celebration of the Great Elisabeth Welch</span>, a World AIDS Day gala in her honour, at the Lyric Theatre, featuring the cream of British show business, who paid tribute to Welch and then joined the audience to give her an unprecedented (as far as anyone there could remember) five standing ovations. Welch made her final professional appearance in 1996, in the Channel 4 television documentary <span class="italic">Black Divas</span>, singing &#145;Stormy Weather&#146; publicly for the last time. By the time she made this appearance, Welch had retired and, when a journalist inquired about the singing technique she had sustained for over eighty years, her simple, direct reply was: &#145;I have no technique. No art, no training. Nothing! Just myself. I describe myself as a singer of popular songs&#146;  (Bourne, xvii).<br>
<br>Welch died on 15 July 2003 at Denville Hall, 2 Ducks Hill Road, Northwood, London (the retirement home for actors and entertainers, where she had lived since 1995); she was cremated on 21 July at Breakspear crematorium. After her death Miles Kreuger, president of the Institute of the American Musical, a Los Angeles research library, told the <span class="italic">Los Angeles Times</span> (19 July 2003):<blockquote>Elisabeth Welch wasn't just another singer; she was a cultural icon, like Ella Fitzgerald is to this country. She could do anything &hellip; with the most sweet and plaintive voice, and she had absolutely impeccable diction and taste. In a recording career that began in 1928 and lasted into the 1990s her voice was absolutely untouched by time.</blockquote>
