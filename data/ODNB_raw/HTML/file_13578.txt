<span class="headword">Holman,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">marine painter</span>, was born in Ramsgate and baptized there on 14 November 1729 at St Laurence-in-Thanet, the eldest son and second of six children of Francis Holman (<i>bap</i>. 1696, <i>d</i>. 1739), master mariner, and his wife, Anne Long (<i>bap</i>. 1707, <i>d</i>. 1757). His paternal grandfather was a Ramsgate cooper; he believed that his ancestors had come from Dorset to St Nicholas-at-Wade in Thanet in 1564. A younger brother, Captain John Holman (1733&#150;1816), to whom Francis evidently remained close, continued the family shipping business. In a letter of 1800 Captain Holman included the reference &#145;in 1758 by Francis Holman Herald Painter&#146;, indicating that his brother may have begun his career in that branch of painting  (MS Letter, priv. coll.). By then Francis Holman lived in Wapping, the main base of Ramsgate's merchant shipping families; all his five known addresses are in or around what are now Wapping High Street and Wapping Lane. Surviving records of St George's-in-the-East document his wife, Elizabeth, and son John (<i>b</i>. 1757), and two more sons, both named Francis, who died in infancy. Holman was a widower by 1781, when on 7 May he married Jane Maxted (<i>c</i>.1736&#150;1790); the Maxteds of Ozengell Grange were a Thanet landowning family. He was apparently childless when he wrote his will in 1783.<br>
<br>Holman's earliest pictures are ship's portraits, often commissioned for ships' masters, a genre in which he continued to paint throughout his career. <span class="italic">The &#145;John and Mary&#146; and the &#145;Three Sisters&#146; off the Coast of Dover</span>, inscribed under the lining &#145;The John &amp; Mary and 3 Sisters. Painted by Francis Holman of Wappen. 1763 for Capt Maudbe&#146;, is a good example (Sotheby sale catalogue, 16 July 1993, p. 12, lot 10). Many paintings show the distinctive landmarks of the Kentish coast, especially the distinctive profile of the line of cliffs around Dover and Deal, that he knew well. From 1767 to 1772 he exhibited eleven pictures at the Free Society of Artists, showing an increasing interest in capturing the mood of the sea in different weathers. The first painting he sent for exhibition was entitled <span class="italic">A Sea Convoy in a Storm</span> (exh. Free Society, 1767); his later <span class="italic">A Sudden Squall, with Ships Sailing through the Narrow Channel Near Reculver in Kent</span> (exh. RA, 1777) was described in 1906 by H. Wilson Holman, to whom it then belonged, as a masterly treatment of sea and sky. By 1773 Holman had taken on an apprentice, Thomas Luny, who exhibited from his master's address in Johnson Street, St George's, Wapping.<br>
<br>In his later years Holman switched to patriotic themes. Between 1774 and 1784 he sent seventeen pictures, mostly of the Royal Navy or sea battles, for exhibition at the Royal Academy. He painted all the important naval engagements of the American War of Independence, most notably a dramatic moment, <span class="italic">The Moonlight Battle off Cape St Vincent, 16th January 1780</span> (exh. RA, 1780; NMM) and <span class="italic">The Battle of the Saints, 12th April 1782</span> (exh. RA, 1783). He also depicted the shipbuilding programme engendered by that war, one of his best-known paintings being the striking <span class="italic">Blackwall Shipyard from the Thames</span> (exh. RA, 1784; NMM). Holman died in Wapping on 29 November 1784. Captain Holman brought his body back to Ramsgate for burial on 4 December in the Maxted family vault at St Laurence, where the vicar recorded his death as due to lethargy.<br>
<br>Since Sir Lionel Cust wrote in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that Holman's work had &#145;met with unmerited neglect&#146; several of his paintings have surfaced in sales and been acquired by museums, and his reputation as a major marine painter has consequently grown. Holman knew his subject matter intimately and approached his chosen profession as a craftsman. His skilful depiction of the seafaring trade in which he grew up provides an entrancing record of many aspects of eighteenth-century naval life.<br>
