<span class="headword">Raven,  John James</span>  (1833&#150;1906), <span class="occ">antiquary and campanologist</span>, born on 25 June 1833 at Boston, Lincolnshire, was the eldest son of eight children of John Hardy Raven, of Huguenot descent, rector of Worlington, near Mildenhall, Suffolk, and his wife, Jane Augusta, daughter of John Richman, attorney, of Lymington, Hampshire. His younger brother, the Revd John Hardy Raven (1842&#150;1911), was headmaster of Beccles School.<br>
<br>Educated at home, Raven entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on 18 October 1853, and migrated in December that year to Emmanuel College with an exhibition. A senior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1857, he proceeded MA in 1860 and DD in 1872. He married on 19 March 1860, at Mildenhall parish church, Suffolk, Fanny, youngest daughter of Robert Homer Harris of Botesdale; they had two daughters and seven sons, three of whom took holy orders.<br>
<br>In 1857 Raven was appointed second master of Sevenoaks grammar school, and was ordained curate of the parish church there. In 1859 he became headmaster of Bungay grammar school, an office always in the gift of Emmanuel College. He improved the school, and raised money for a new building, which was opened in 1863. From 1866 to 1885 he was headmaster of Great Yarmouth grammar school, where a tower commemorates his time. He served for some time as curate of the parish church in Great Yarmouth, and was from 1881 to 1885 vicar of St George's in that town. In 1885 he was presented by Emmanuel to the cure of Fressingfield and Withersdale, and in 1895 to Metfield, all in Suffolk. An honorary canon of Norwich from 1888, and rural dean of Hoxne from 1896, he was co-opted as a founder member of the county education committee in 1902.<br>
<br>Raven began his lifelong antiquarian studies by examining the bells of the churches near his home at Worlington, and was only twenty-one when he contributed to the Parkers' <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History of Suffolk</span> in 1855. He served from 1881 until his death on the committee of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society, which he joined in 1871, was a vice-president of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology, and was elected FSA on 23 April 1891. A keen bell ringer, and president of the Norwich Diocesan Association of Change Ringers, Raven was a leading writer on campanology among those then publishing county surveys. His <span class="italic">Church Bells of Cambridgeshire</span> (1869), <span class="italic">Church Bells of Suffolk</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">Bells of England</span> (1906) remain standard works of reference. He also published a popular <span class="italic">History of Suffolk</span> in 1895, which he fittingly claimed was &#145;a personal intercourse with all classes&#146;, and was a contributor to the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> of Suffolk.<br>
<br>Raven died at Fressingfield vicarage on 20 September 1906, and was buried in the churchyard there on 24 September. A reredos was erected to his memory and a lectern provided in the church. His fine library of county and bell literature was sold at Fressingfield in November 1906.<br>
