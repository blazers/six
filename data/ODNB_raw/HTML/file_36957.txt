<span class="headword">Wilson,  Henry Sch&uuml;tz</span>  (1824&#150;1902), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, born in London on 15 September 1824, was a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38136/', "Effingham Wilson (1785&#150;1868)")</script> and his second wife, Maria, a daughter of Thomas James of The Brownings, Chigwell, Essex. His father, a native of Kirkby Ravensworth, Yorkshire, was a bookseller and publisher with radical political views.<br>
<br>After education at a private school at Highgate, Middlesex, Wilson worked for ten years in a commercial house in London and mastered French, German, and Italian. Subsequently assistant secretary of the Electric and International Telegraph Company, he retired on a pension when the business was taken over by the Post Office in 1870. He edited the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers</span> from 1872.<br>
<br>Wilson's real interests lay in foreign travel, mountaineering, and study of foreign literature and history. A profound admirer of Goethe's work, he published <span class="italic">Count Egmont as Depicted in Fancy, Poetry, and History</span> in 1863. In later years he contributed frequently to London magazines, and reissued his articles in <span class="italic">Studies and Romances</span> (1873), <span class="italic">Studies in History, Legend, and Literature</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">History and Criticism</span> (1886). He was an early admirer of the poet Edward FitzGerald's long-neglected translations from the Persian, and FitzGerald welcomed Wilson's encouragement. He also wrote studies of the Conciergerie, Bianca Capello, and Albrecht von Wallenstein, as well as criticism of the works of Tennyson and Arthur Wing Pinero. His novels <span class="italic">The Three Paths</span>, <span class="italic">The Voyage of the Lady</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">Philip Mannington</span> (1874) were translated into German.<br>
<br>Wilson, who was a member of the Alpine Club from 1871 to 1898, ascended the Matterhorn in the Alps on 26&#150;27 August 1875 with Frederic Morshead and A. D. Prickard, and on 15 August 1876 with Morshead. Melchior Anderegg was one of Wilson's guides, and Wilson wrote &#145;Anderegg as a sculptor&#146; for the <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span> (November 1873) as well as descriptions of his experiences in <span class="italic">Alpine Ascents and Adventures</span> (1878).<br>
<br>Interested in both the English and the German stage, Wilson was popular in literary and artistic society. He was a capable fencer and a zealous volunteer, becoming captain in the Artists' corps. He died, unmarried, at the house of his nephew, John Sch&uuml;tz Sharman, 2 Avenue Gate, Norwood, London, on 7 May 1902. His body was cremated, and the ashes were placed in the Sharman vault at Norwood cemetery.<br>
