<span class="headword">Custance,  Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1908), <span class="occ">jockey</span>, born at Peterborough on 27 February 1842, was the son of Samuel Custance, a postboy, and his wife, Elizabeth Carpenter. Devoted from childhood to horses and to riding, he rode at thirteen in a pony race at Ramsey in Huntingdonshire. After vainly seeking employment at Newmarket, he spent three years at Epsom, where, in his own words, he had &#145;a jolly, though rough, time&#146; in the employment of Edward (Ned) Smith of South Hatch, who was associated with the sporting journal <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>, and raced his horses in the name of Mellish.<br>
<br>Custance's first important victory was gained on Rocket in 1858 in the Cesarewitch, which he won again in 1861 on Audrey. In 1860 he was attached to the Russley stable, then under the management of Matthew Dawson, and that season he rode over forty winners, including Thormanby in the Derby. This victory earned him a present of &pound;100 from the owner, Mr Merry, the only gift he received in three years of riding for the Glasgow ironmaster. In 1863 he became stable jockey at East Ilsley for James Dover, who trained the 1866 triple crown winner Lord Lyon. Unfortunately Custance missed the Two Thousand Guineas ride because of a fall at the Epsom spring meeting. He won a third Derby in 1874 on the vile-tempered George Frederick. By this time Custance was having to waste heavily just to make 8 stone 10 lb, and in 1879 he retired. His last winning mount was Lollypop in the All-Aged Stakes at the Newmarket Houghton meeting.<br>
<br>As a jockey Custance was bold and resolute, had good hands, and was a fine judge of pace. After his retirement from the saddle he long remained a familiar figure on the racecourse. He held for many years a licence as deputy starter to the Jockey Club, and was also official starter to the Belgian Jockey Club. In 1885 he officiated at the Derby, thus becoming the first person to both win and start that race. Living at Oakham, where he was proprietor of The George inn, he regularly hunted with the Quorn and Cottesmore packs. He was always a cheerful and amusing companion, and published <span class="italic">Riding Recollections and Turf Stories</span> in 1894. He died of a paralytic seizure at his home, 53 New Walk, Leicester, on 19 April 1908, leaving a widow, Mary. Laid out in 1906, New Walk led to Leicester's Victoria Park, site of the city's original racecourse.<br>
