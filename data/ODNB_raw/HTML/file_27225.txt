<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span>  (1813&#150;1862), <span class="occ">architectural sculptor</span>, was born at Chalford, Gloucestershire, and rose from modest beginnings to outstanding success. His parents are untraced. Apprenticed in 1825 to a stonemason, he was regarded as a &#145;prodigy of precocious genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>). In the final year of his apprenticeship, on a visit to his brother Robert, Oxford's architecture fired his ambition as a carver and draughtsman. He settled in Birmingham, where his elder brother William practised as an architect; his carving on monuments impressed Sir Charles Barry, who hired him to carve in wood and stone the coats of arms and other ornamental work for his Gothic-style King Edward VI Grammar School, Birmingham (1833&#150;7; dem.).<br>
<br>Barry, recognizing &#145;his sureness of hand, celerity of execution and commanding intelligence&#146;  (Scott, 79), employed Thomas in 1837 to manage the production of the carving for his new Palace of Westminster. To hone Thomas's knowledge in preparation for this challenge, Barry sent him on a drawing tour of Belgium. The office of woods ratified the arrangement in 1841 and appointed Thomas as superintendent of stone carving in 1846 at a salary of &pound;300 p.a. (&pound;400 from 1847 to 1850). From small drawings supplied by Barry's office, he and his team developed large-scale drawings which formed the basis of the full-size plasters from which the figures and architectural work were carved in stone. Underpinned by &#145;the complete practical training, with the versatile and inventive ability, displayed by Thomas&#146;  (ibid., 80), Barry's vision of a sculpture programme to commemorate British history through heraldry and figures of the kings and queens from Saxon times to Queen Victoria, together with national figures and saints associated with Britain, was carried out triumphantly. Closely overseeing Thomas, Barry estimated that the cost of this work up to 1850 totalled &pound;32,000.<br>
<br>Thomas worked on many other famous building projects of his day. For Robert Stephenson's Britannia Railway Bridge across the Menai Strait to Anglesey (opened in 1850) he carved the monumental lions weighing 80 tons; for Edward Walter's Manchester Free Trade Hall, tympana depicting <span class="italic">The Continents</span>, <span class="italic">Trade</span>, <span class="italic">The Arts</span>, <span class="italic">Industry</span>, and so on (1853&#150;6); and for Cuthbert Brodrick's Leeds town hall (1858), a tympanum of <span class="italic">Progress, Art and Commerce</span>. His workshop was equally adept at the Italian Renaissance palazzo style, then especially popular with banks. The sumptuous carving on the former West of England and South Wales District Bank in Bristol by W. B. Gingell and T. K. Lysaght (1854&#150;8) and on the Langside Public Hall in Glasgow (designed as a bank by J. Gibson, 1847) illustrates the high standard that his workshop achieved. Barry went to him for both his Italian Renaissance Bridgewater House, London (1845&#150;54), and for his alterations to Harewood House, Yorkshire (1848&#150;50). The workshop continued to undertake Gothic-style carving, as shown in the series of figures connected with Bristol history for the Guildhall designed by R. S. Pope (1843&#150;6).<br>
<br>The variety of Thomas's output was wide: Italianate garden ornaments and layouts (for example, <span class="italic">The Atlas Fountain</span>, Castle Howard, and reliefs for the Serpentine, Hyde Park, London); church furnishings (including the font designed by Thomas Willement for Davington Priory, Kent, costing &pound;17 8<i>s</i>. in 1847, and the figure of St Michael for Sowton, Devon, 1845); and designs for the decorative arts such as the <span class="italic">St George Fountain</span> (des.), manufactured in majolica by Minton &amp; Co., shown at the 1862 Exhibition, London, and glass chandeliers made by Osler of Birmingham for the New Palace, Constantinople.<br>
<br>Through his involvement with the new Palace of Westminster, Thomas met Sir Morton Peto, its building contractor, and his partner, Edward Ladd Betts. For both he worked as an architect. For Betts&#151;a generous buyer of his marble sculpture&#151;he built Preston Hall, Aylesford, Kent (1850), and laid out its garden. Peto commissioned him to rebuild Somerleyton Hall, Suffolk (begun 1844). Here Thomas not only created a vast Italianate/Jacobean pile in red brick with exaggeratedly large stone architectural elements, set in lavish gardens, but rebuilt the church and village too. Peto also had Thomas design the Regent's Park Chapel and carve the memorial to Sir Hugh Myddleton, the originator of the &#145;new river project&#146; for Islington Green, London (1862).<br>
<br>Thomas presumably met his most illustrious architectural patron, Prince Albert, through his Westminster work. The warm obituary in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> recorded, &#145;The Prince Consort highly esteemed Thomas and appreciated the simplicity of his character; he found in the plain-spoken Gloucestershire artist a man of consummate ability without conceit or arrogance&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>). Among the no doubt closely supervised commissions for his royal patron were the tiled dairy in the Home Farm, Windsor, reliefs of Peace and War for the interior of Buckingham Palace, and the remodelling of the print room at Windsor.<br>
<br>Thomas also worked as a fine art sculptor, exhibiting frequently at the Royal Academy between 1842 and 1861. His subjects&#151;<span class="italic">Lear</span> (exh. RA, 1842); <span class="italic">Musidora</span> (exh. RA, 1849); <span class="italic">Queen Boadicea</span> (exh. RA, 1856); <span class="italic">Una and the Lion</span> (exh. RA, 1861); and <span class="italic">Lady Godiva</span> (plaster, exh. RA, 1861; Maidstone Museum, Kent)&#151;are typical of his time. He undertook some public monuments: for Birmingham, figures of <span class="italic">Thomas Attwood</span>, the radical (unveiled 1859, cost &pound;900) and <span class="italic">Joseph Surge</span>, a Quaker philanthropist (unveiled 1862, cost &pound;1000), and, presented to Maidstone, Kent, by Alexander Randal, a drinking fountain incorporating a statue of Queen Victoria under a Gothic canopy (1862).<br>
<br>Thomas was twice married; in 1851 he was a widower with a six-year-old daughter, and by 1861 was married to Mary (<i>b</i>. 1825/6). He died at his home, Florentine Villa, 15 Blomfield Road, Paddington, London, on 9 April 1862 from blood poisoning&#151;or overwork, according to his friends who felt that his life had been shortened by the initially hostile response to the showing of his <span class="italic">National Monument to Shakespeare</span> in the 1862 Exhibition in London. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Contemporaries admired Thomas for his prodigious energy and ambition to work as architect, fine art sculptor, and architectural carver. Barry in a letter summed up the man whose talent had enabled him to build one of the icons of the Victorian age as &#145;an unassuming self taught genius in his way&#146;  (priv. coll.).<br>
