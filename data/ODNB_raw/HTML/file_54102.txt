<span class="headword">Rushton,  Benjamin</span>  (1785&#150;1853), <span class="occ">hand-loom weaver and radical agitator</span>, was born at Dewsbury in Yorkshire, but later moved to Halifax, where he found employment as a fancy-worsted weaver, residing at Friendly Fold in the village of Ovenden. He married Mary Helliwell (<i>b</i>. 1786) of Ovenden at Halifax parish church on 16 August 1809, but by 1851 was a widower, living with his daughter, son-in-law, grandchildren, and sons. His sons, Zimri and Henry Hunt Rushton, bore respectively the names of an obscure <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> rebel leader and a celebrated contemporary radical orator, while his grandchildren's names commemorated the Chartist leader Henry Vincent and the legendary Swiss freedom fighter William Tell, reflecting the radical sympathies of this weaving family across two generations.<br>
<br>At a public meeting in Halifax in January 1838, well before the publication of the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span>, Rushton supported a resolution calling for five of its six points, maintaining that &#145;until they had universal suffrage the aristocracy would continue to rob them&#146;. He also proposed a motion for the repeal of the new poor law, lamenting the prospect of ending his days in a &#145;bastille&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Guardian</span>, 23 Jan 1838). He later addressed a vast Chartist open-air demonstration at Hartshead Moor in support of the first national petition in May 1839; harangued meetings of rioters in Halifax in August 1842, for which he was arrested and imprisoned; chaired a Chartist rally on Skircoat Moor in April 1848 in support of the third national petition; spoke at a mass meeting at Blackstone Edge on the eve of the return of Ernest Jones to Halifax, following his release from prison in July 1850; and served as treasurer for the West Riding Chartists.<br>
<br>Rushton was remembered by contemporaries as a passionate speaker with a tendency to use &#145;rather broad language&#146;  (Wilson, 220). Occasionally his tone was menacing, for example, when he unambiguously advocated armed action and openly expressed sympathy with continental revolutionaries following the rejection of the third Chartist petition in May 1848; but the imagery and rhetoric of his public oratory drew heavily on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He observed cynically at a general election meeting in 1841 that all the candidates were promising &#145;plenty of gold and silver like the stones in the Jerusalem streets and loaves as large as Goliath of Gath&#146; while the banner of the Ovenden weavers proclaimed &#145;Be not ye afraid of them, remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Guardian</span>, 3 July 1841).<br>
<br>Rushton was received into membership of the Methodist New Connexion at Salem, North Parade, Halifax, on 19 February 1815, and subsequently supported the development of the cause at Ovenden, serving as a Sunday school teacher and popular local preacher, appearing at chapel anniversary services in a clean brat, patched knee-breeches, highly polished clogs, and a tall hat. However, he became increasingly critical of organized religion and vociferously anti-clerical. At an anti-poor law meeting in Halifax in 1837 he criticized the whig government's provision of a salary of &pound;15,000 for the archbishop of Canterbury and later seconded a resolution at Hartshead Moor binding the meeting &#145;not to attend any place of worship where the administration of services is inimical to civil liberty&#146;  (Yeo, 120). He probably withdrew from the Methodist New Connexion around the time of William Cobbett's appeal to Methodists to refuse to pay their dues, later declaring that &#145;he had given nothing to the parsons since 1821&#146;, but continued to preach on Methodist property until the end of the decade, to the growing consternation of the Methodist authorities  (E. P. Thompson, 438). Thereafter he occupied the pulpits of radical and secessionist congregations across the West Riding, taking as his text &#145;The poor ye have with you always&#146; on one documented occasion at the Chartist chapel at Littletown in the Spen valley  (ibid., 439). His Methodist background and predominantly radical sympathies were characteristic of a generation of popular preachers who brought radical instincts into Methodism and Methodist insights into radicalism until expulsion or withdrawal severed their increasingly tenuous links with the Methodist movement. Indeed, before his death he pointedly requested that no paid minister be allowed to speak at his funeral.<br>
<br>By 1847, in order to supplement his meagre earnings from weaving and enable him to buy shares in the Chartist land company, Rushton had acquired the additional occupation of tea dealer. He continued weaving into his late sixties and was observed by the Chartist Ernest Jones working on intricate patterns at his loom shortly before his death. Rushton died on 17 June 1853 at Friendly Fold, Ovenden, Halifax. He died, as he had lived, in poverty. The local Chartist executive decreed that he should have a public funeral at their expense on Sunday 26 June 1853 and that, in accordance with his wishes, a petition calling for the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span> should be adopted &#145;over his remains&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Courier</span>, 25 June 1853). In the event, the petition was adopted at a rally held immediately after the funeral ceremony, which was conducted at the Halifax general cemetery, Lister Lane, by R. G. Gammage of the Chartist national executive and members of the Ovenden Oddfellows, of which Rushton had been an honorary member, with a eulogy hailing Rushton as &#145;a noble patriot&#146; delivered by Ernest Jones  (Vincent, 220). Rushton was borne to the grave by a hearse drawn by beplumed horses along a route lined, as Ernest Jones observed, by &#145;a continuous wall of human beings ranged for a length of two miles on either side of road&#146;  (Epstein and Thompson, 329). Five special trains brought Chartists from Bradford, and attendance at the funeral, estimated by the <span class="italic">Halifax Guardian</span> at between 6000 and 10,000, was greater than that at the funerals of national Chartist leaders. The Chartist historian Dorothy Thompson has concluded that &#145;Rushton epitomised the type of West Riding local leader&#146;, the majority of whom were weavers, &#145;earning their living at their work but always taking time to attend, and very often chair great demonstrations or local meetings&#146;  (D. Thompson, 225&#150;6).<br>
