<span class="headword">Barillon d'Amoncourt,  Paul</span>, marquis de Branges in the French nobility  (1630<span class="mult">x</span>38&#150;1691), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the eldest of the four sons (one of whom was born in 1639) of Jean-Jacques Barillon (1601&#150;1645) and his wife, Bonne Fayet (<i>d</i>. 1682). His father, president of the <i>chambre des requ&ecirc;tes</i> of the Paris <i>parlement</i>, died in the fortress of Pinerolo, where he had been imprisoned for opposing the government of Cardinal Mazarin. Barillon was looked after by his rich and childless uncle Antoine Barillon de Morangis (1599&#150;1672), who became <i>directeur des finances royales</i> in 1648. His uncle had married the heiress of Ren&eacute; d'Amoncourt, baron de Branges, and when she died in 1669 Barillon inherited her estate at Montigny, added her name to his own, and was created marquis de Branges.<br>
<br>Protected by his influential uncle, Barillon pursued a successful administrative career. Having become a <i>conseiller</i> at the Paris <i>parlement</i> in 1650, he was made a <i>ma&icirc;tre des requ&ecirc;tes</i> in 1657 and appointed <i>intendant</i> of Paris. From there he was transferred to Amiens. After the death of his uncle in 1672 he was appointed <i>conseiller d'&eacute;tat</i> and sent as <i>intendant</i> with the army of Marshal Turenne during the first two campaigns of the Franco-Dutch War. Barillon had obtained the patronage of the marquis de Louvois, and had influential friends at court, including Louis XIV's favourite, the marquise de Maintenon.<br>
<br>Barillon's official duties had meanwhile brought him into contact with Honor&eacute; Courtin. The two men had worked on the delimitation of the new Franco-Spanish frontier in Flanders following the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) and were the French plenipotentiaries at the unsuccessful peace conference at Cologne in 1673. When Courtin was recalled from a short embassy to London (1676&#150;7) Barillon, a rich man since the death of his uncle, seemed an appropriate successor. He was nominated ambassador at London in May 1677.<br>
<br>Barillon remained French ambassador in London until 1689. His long embassy falls into two separate periods. In the first, from 1677 until the end of 1680, he established close links with the parliamentary opposition in order to frustrate the policies of Charles II and weaken England's international position. His initial instructions were to impede the efforts of Thomas Osborne, first earl of Danby, to achieve co-operation between Charles II and the Cavalier Parliament based on a pro-Dutch policy and involving the possibility of war against France. He did this by distributing bribes, most notably to George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, and Algernon Sidney, to encourage the opposition in parliament to believe that any money voted for an army would be used not against France but on the contrary to strengthen royal power in alliance with Louis XIV. Barillon's policy achieved spectacular success when Ralph Montagu, recently returned from his embassy to Paris, revealed Danby's secret negotiations for a French alliance. Barillon took the credit for this at the French court, but actually he merely encouraged Montagu by giving him money.<br>
<br>During the exclusion crisis that followed Barillon maintained his close links with the whig opposition. This changed, however, when Charles II agreed to accept a French subsidy in November 1680. In the succeeding months Barillon gradually severed his contacts with the opposition leaders and instead built up close relations with the court circles surrounding Charles II and the duke of York, in co-operation with the king's mistress Louise de K&eacute;roualle, duchess of Portsmouth. In a series of secret nocturnal meetings he transferred from his coach to that of York's brother-in-law Laurence Hyde, first earl of Rochester, each French subsidy of 100,000 livres.<br>
<br>Barillon was much less effective during the reign of James II. His task of maintaining close Anglo-French relations was undermined by the general hostility felt in England towards the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the consequent removal of remaining elements of toleration for French protestants. Moreover the new king favoured a foreign policy of neutrality towards Louis XIV and the new anti-French League of Augsburg. Barillon relied on Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, whose conversion to Catholicism was made public in April 1687, and as a result became increasingly out of touch with English opinion. Having severed his links with the whigs, he now narrowed his contacts even within the court itself. He thus failed to perceive the extent of the opposition that was provoked by James II's policies.<br>
<br>Barillon's embassy was terminated by the revolution of 1688&#150;9, of which he was no more than a witness. He was ordered by Louis XIV to warn James II of the imminent invasion of England by William of Orange, but his warning was dismissed as an attempt to obtain an alliance. He accompanied James II to join the royal army on Salisbury Plain, and returned with him to Whitehall. But a few days after James had fled to France, Barillon was ordered by William to leave England with only twenty-four hours' notice. He reached the French court at Versailles on 4 January 1689 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. By then he was prematurely aged and badly overweight, and was relieved not to be asked to accompany James II to Ireland. He settled in Paris, and died there on 23 July 1691. With his wife, Marie-Madeleine Mangot de Villarceaux, he had one son, Antoine (<i>d</i>. 1741), who succeeded him as marquis de Branges.<br>
<br>Barillon's links with the parliamentary opposition during the exclusion crisis and the evidence contained in his dispatches about the opinions of James II and the court in the period leading to the revolution of 1688&#150;9 underlie his continuing significance. The originals are in the Archives du Minist&egrave;re des Affaires &Eacute;trang&egrave;res in Paris, but the Baschet transcriptions in the National Archives have been widely used by British historians.<br>
