<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clyde,  James Avon</span>, Lord Clyde  (1863&#150;1944), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Dollar, Clackmannanshire, on 14 November 1863, the second son of James Clyde LLD and his wife, Elizabeth Rigg, of Whitehaven, Cumberland. His father was a distinguished teacher of the classics, first at Dollar Academy and later for many years at the Edinburgh Academy. Young Clyde himself entered the latter school and after being <i>dux</i> of all his classes and of the school proceeded to the University of Edinburgh, where his career was equally brilliant. He graduated with first-class honours in classics in 1884, won the Gray scholarship in that year, and graduated LLB in 1888. During his university days he was a prime mover in the establishment of a students' representative council and a students' union; he learned to debate at the Speculative Society, training ground of many famous lawyers, and was successively librarian and president of that body, of which he became an honorary member in 1921. In 1910 he was made honorary LLD of Edinburgh University, and in 1923 received the same distinction at St Andrews.<br>
<br>Clyde passed advocate in 1887. He had no influence, but his contemporaries at the &#145;Spec&#146; and elsewhere were convinced that he would go straight to the top. And this, after one or two lean years, he proceeded to do. In addition to great natural ability he was a tireless worker, and once he had secured a hearing the easy maturity of his style made such a strong impression that work flowed in. Well armed at every point as an advocate, he had established the heaviest junior practice at the bar by 1901, when he became a KC. Thereafter he carried all before him, and the House of Lords reports attest the almost universal sweep of his activities as counsel. He became solicitor-general in 1905 during the closing months of the Unionist government, and later returned to office as lord advocate from 1916 (when he was sworn of the privy council) to 1920. He had become dean of the Faculty of Advocates in 1915, and on his appointment as lord advocate his brethren paid him the unique distinction of asking him to continue in office as dean in spite of his new duties. He resigned the deanship in 1919; he was elected honorary bencher of Gray's Inn in the same year. Of all the many celebrated cases in which Clyde appeared perhaps the most noteworthy was that heard in 1918 by the judicial committee of the privy council regarding the ownership of the unalienated lands of Southern Rhodesia. Clyde led for the British South Africa Company, and in a galaxy of counsel which included many of the leaders of the English bar, among them Sir F. E. Smith, there was general agreement that Clyde's performance was easily the finest.<br>
<br>A lifelong Unionist in politics, Clyde became member for West (subsequently North) Edinburgh in 1909, and retained his seat until his elevation to the bench in 1920. With one noteworthy exception, his contributions to the work of the House of Commons were almost wholly those of an efficient law officer. The exception occurred in August 1919, when he replied to strictures on the lord advocate and his department for failing to prosecute in a case of fraud at Renfrew aerodrome. A member present wrote that &#145;Clyde's answer did not contain a violent or a bitter word; but throughout it there ran an undercurrent of mockery, which was gentle and playful&#151;and deadly&#146;  (private information). Hopes that he would thereafter take a more prominent part in the business of the house were ended in 1920 by his appointment, with the judicial title of Lord Clyde, as lord justice-general of Scotland and lord president of the Court of Session in succession to Lord Strathclyde.<br>
<br>Clyde's fifteen years as head of the court in Scotland constitute the most important chapter in the story of his life. A sound lawyer, he was never afraid to enunciate general principles, and his judgments, ranging over every department of Scots law, increasingly provided material to writers, advocates, and judges in their work. The burden of the court fell heavily on Clyde's shoulders during his period of office, since with some noteworthy exceptions his immediate colleagues were not distinguished for ability or teamwork. His extempore judgments were always impressive, assisted as they were by his fine presence, good voice, and easy flow of English. They were as finished and well expressed as the written judgments of others. In his reserved judgments there was a tendency to over-elaboration, but all were written out first in his own hand, and were therefore free from the verbosity born of dictation. He once deprecated &#145;unreceptive judicial silence&#146;, and certainly did not indulge in it himself. But his interventions made for a high standard of pleading, and he had a stimulating influence on all who appeared before him. He loved battle, and like a good fighter he was always prepared to take as good as he gave. Throughout his career, and into old age, he was always the dominant figure in any gathering. His appearance, his manner, even his walk, suggested, as was the fact, that he was endowed with an immense store of vitality and power.<br>
<br>No account of Clyde's presidency would be complete without reference to two heavy outside tasks undertaken by him during its currency. In 1926 he became chairman of the royal commission appointed to report on the Court of Session and the office of sheriff-principal. The labour involved was immense, and the report, an exhaustive one, advised drastic reforms in procedure, which were partly carried out by statute in 1933. Clyde deplored the transfer of the Advocates' Library to the nation in 1925, but as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the new board of trustees he played an indefatigable part in seeing the new institution through its teething troubles. From 1936 he was chairman of the board and its main driving force.<br>
<br>In 1895 Clyde married Anna Margaret McDiarmid (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of Peter Wallwork Latham, Downing professor of medicine at Cambridge; they had two sons, of whom the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37295/', "James Latham McDiarmid Clyde")</script>, became lord justice-general of Scotland and lord president of the Court of Session in 1954. Always a lover of the country, Clyde retired in 1935 to his home at Briglands, Rumbling Bridge, Kinross-shire, literally &#145;to cultivate his garden&#146;, for he was a great rose-grower. He became lord lieutenant of Kinross-shire and when the war came took an active part in organizing the war savings of the county, with results remarkable for an agricultural community. When still lord president, he had found time to publish, in two volumes, his own translation of Sir Thomas Craig's <span class="italic">Jus feudale</span> (1934). He followed this up in his retirement by the publication, in two volumes (1937&#150;8) for the Stair Society, of Sir Thomas Hope's <span class="italic">Major Practicks, 1608&#150;1633</span>. Finally, again for the Stair Society, he published (1943) an edition of the <span class="italic">Acta dominorum concilii, 1501&#150;1503</span>. It may be regretted that to these works of scholarship he did not add his personal reminiscences, for he had, in informal talk, a great gift of vivid and racy characterization. Clyde died in Edinburgh after a short illness on 16 June 1944.<br>
