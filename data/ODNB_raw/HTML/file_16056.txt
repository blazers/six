<span class="headword">Lanquet,  Thomas</span>  (1520/21&#150;1545), <span class="occ">historian</span>, is of unknown origins. Wood asserts that he studied at Oxford, but neither he nor the university records offer evidence to support the claim. Lanquet is known for having undertaken a history of the known world in which the fortunes of nations and peoples are summarized together year by year. His purpose was didactic and moralizing, as he explains in his introduction  (Lanquet and Cooper, fols. 1&#150;2<i>v</i>). &#145;In reading of historyes examples of politicall vertues and civill affayres ought to bee observed&#146;, he declares, and he eulogizes Henry VIII as a perhaps surprising illustration of the truth &#145;that good princis bee preserved and defended by god&#146;. He displays humanistic leanings in a chapter devoted to &#145;the originall begynnyng of man, after the false opinion of the Ethnike [heathen] philosophers&#146;, but his framework is firmly Christian. Lanquet proposed to divide his history into three sections, from the creation (dated to 3962 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) to Abraham, from Abraham to the birth of Christ, and finally down to his own time. But he died in London in 1545, aged twenty-four, having reached only the accession of Tiberius (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 17).<br>
<br>Lanquet's work was completed by Thomas Cooper, later successively bishop of Lincoln and of Winchester, and it was published in 1549 as <span class="italic">An Epitome of Cronicles</span>, with a dedication to the duke of Somerset. In the epistle to the reader announcing his taking up the reins, Cooper describes Lanquet as a &#145;studious younge man&#146; and acknowledges his &#145;greate laboure and diligence&#146;  (Lanquet and Cooper, fol. 84). The tribute was well deserved. On the evidence of references to such writers as Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Sallust, Julius Caesar, Eusebius, and Bede, Lanquet was widely read in Greek and Latin sources. His having consulted &#145;the conspiracy of Catiline, translated into english by Thomas Paynell&#146;  (ibid., fol. 82<i>v</i>), a work intended to encourage obedience to the crown, may be a further pointer to Lanquet's political position. In other respects Lanquet's views are hard to discover, possibly a sign of an eirenic temperament. He states explicitly that he finds the British and Scottish origin myths incredible, but nevertheless resolves to use them&#151;&#145;I wil not discent from the common opinion therof, but wil also folow it as nere as I may&#146;  (ibid., fol. 32). He knew the scriptures well but says nothing, even in his account of the life of Christ, to indicate his own religious position. In a comment on the early Jewish sects he compares the Essenes to Anabaptists, who &#145;condemned bothe the Lutheranes and papistes, and studyed to bee seene holyer than thei bothe&#146;  (ibid., fol. 75<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), but that is the limit of his partisanship. In 1559 Robert Crowley reissued the <span class="italic">Epitome</span> with a continuation to the accession of Elizabeth, virulently anti-Catholic in its account of recent events. But in 1560 Cooper in turn brought out another edition, repudiating Crowley's and in its continuation much less violent against Rome. This edition was reissued in 1565. Lanquet is also said by Bale to have written an account of Henry VIII's capture of Boulogne in September 1544, which has not survived.<br>
