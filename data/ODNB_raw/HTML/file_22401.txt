<span class="headword">Plumptre,  Charles John</span>  (1818&#150;1887), <span class="occ">barrister and writer on elocution</span>, was born on 28 March 1818, the eldest son of Edward Hallows Plumptre (1785&#150;1851), a London solicitor. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22402/', "Edward Hayes Plumptre (1821&#150;1891)")</script>, dean of Wells. After receiving an education at private schools and King's College, London, Plumptre was entered at Gray's Inn in May 1838, and was called to the bar on 5 June 1844. Shortly before this, on 14 March 1844, he had married Caroline Colmer (<i>b</i>. 1819/20), the younger daughter and coheir of her father, Robert Colmer. In conjunction with George Harris, Plumptre edited the ninth and eleventh volumes of <span class="italic">The County Courts' Chronicle</span> (1860&#150;61), and, in conjunction with Mr Serjeant Edward William Cox, between 1850 and 1860 he established the Public Reading Society, providing the first penny readings for the public.<br>
<br>Plumptre's fine presence and his expressive, sweet, and powerful voice led him to devote himself to the study and practice of elocution. He gradually withdrew from practice at the bar and concentrated on lecturing on his favourite art, especially at the universities and at the various theological colleges, where his teaching was highly valued. He held official appointments as lecturer on elocution both at Oxford and at King's College. In 1861 he published a course of lectures delivered at Oxford in 1860; these subsequently formed the basis of a large work, <span class="italic">The Principles and Practice of Elocution</span> (1861), which was dedicated to the prince of Wales, and went through five editions. After the death of his first wife he married Adelaide, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Denton, the widow of Robert Becher, on 24 January 1866; she was to predecease him. He went on to publish <span class="italic">The Culture of Voice and Speech</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">The Right Mode of Respiration</span> (1886). He died on 15 June 1887 at his home, 36 Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, London, survived by two sons, also lawyers.<br>
