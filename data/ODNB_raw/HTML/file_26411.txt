<span class="headword">Stearne <span class="st"> [Sterne]</span>,  John</span>  (1660&#150;1745), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Clogher and benefactor</span>, was born in Dublin, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26410/', "John Stearne (1624&#150;1669)")</script>, physician, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of Charles Ryves. He was educated at Mr Ryder's school in Dublin and entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 April 1674. He graduated BA (11 February 1678), MA (12 August 1681), and DD (1693). Having been ordained deacon in October 1682 by Anthony Dopping, bishop of Meath, he served for a time as Dopping's domestic chaplain. About 1688 he was made vicar of Trim; in October 1692 he was instituted to the rectory of Clonmacduffe, and in June 1703 to that of Killary, both in the diocese of Meath. On 11 September 1702 he was installed chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Upon the death of his mother's relative Dean Jerome Ryves, Stearne was elected dean of St Patrick's Cathedral by the chapter, largely, it was said, owing to the exertions of Jonathan Swift, then prebendary of Dunlavin. Stearne retained with the deanery the curacy of St Nicholas Without, which Swift afterwards maintained Stearne had promised to make over to him as a reward for his support. In July 1707 Stearne was instrumental in the election of Swift to represent the Dublin chapter in the Irish convocation. Soon afterwards he joined a small social club which included Swift and Esther Johnson. Swift's letters from this period contain numerous references to Stearne; Swift took an interest in the building operations at the deanery, offered advice on the layout of the garden, and exhorted Stearne to set an example to the Irish bishops by opposing the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>.<br>
<br>Having been helped by Swift to obtain the deanery of St Patrick's, Stearne likewise owed his promotion to the episcopate to him. On 28 October 1712 Swift wrote to Esther Johnson that if he were asked who would make a good bishop he would name Stearne before anybody else. When the vacancy of the diocese of Dromore occurred, and before he had any idea of the deanery for himself, Swift accordingly recommended Stearne to Lord Bolingbroke and to the second duke of Ormond. Stearne was consecrated bishop of Dromore on 10 May 1713, and on 30 March 1717, following the departure of St George Ashe to the diocese of Derry, he was translated to the diocese of Clogher. A well-respected churchman, in 1729 Stearne received the praise of William King, archbishop of Dublin, who hinted at the possibility (unrealized) of Stearne becoming his successor.<br>
<br>In 1721 Stearne had been appointed vice-chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, and, in 1726, he presented a sum of &pound;1000 for a university printing house and press, which was established in 1734. Stearne died at Clogher, unmarried, on 6 June 1745. He was buried there. By his will, dated 13 May 1741, he generously endowed a large number of local charities, especially Dr Richard Steevens's Hospital and the Blue Coat Hospital, Dublin; he also left &pound;600 to Dean Swift's hospital for lunatics. He rebuilt the episcopal mansions at Dromore and Clogher, as well as St Patrick's deanery, and he left &pound;1000 for a granite spire to be added to St Patrick's Cathedral. In addition he left &pound;500 or &pound;2000, at the discretion of his executors, towards finishing the cathedral of Clogher. He provided &pound;50 per annum in exhibitions to Trinity College, Dublin, with preference to be given to poor scholars from the diocese of Clogher. Stearne also donated the rarer books in his library to Marsh's Library in Dublin; the remainder of his books were distributed by lot among the poor curates of the diocese. His manuscripts, including the depositions of the 1641 uprising, were left to Trinity College, Dublin. Stearne's only published work of importance, his <span class="italic">Tractatus de visitatione infirmorum</span> (1697), was reprinted in England throughout the eighteenth century and was translated, in 1840, as <span class="italic">The Curate's Manual</span>.<br>
