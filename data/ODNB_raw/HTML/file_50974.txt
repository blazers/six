<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dickens,  Monica Enid</span>  (1915&#150;1992), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 10 May 1915 at 52 Chepstow Villas, Bayswater, London, the fifth of the five children of Henry Charles Dickens (1878&#150;1966), barrister, and his wife, Fanny (1876&#150;1966), daughter of Herman and Emma Runge. Monica Dickens was a great-granddaughter of the novelist Charles Dickens. Her father was the eldest son of Dickens's eighth child, Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, common serjeant of London. She herself became one of the two or three best-selling women novelists of her generation, with the publication of forty-three books between 1939 and 1993.<br>
<br>Monica Dickens was educated at St Paul's Girls' School, on a double scholarship, but was expelled for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. A lively, attractive girl, with glamorous blonde hair, she joined the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art but was asked to leave, she claimed, for not being able to act. Although she was presented at court in 1935, she was not a success as a d&eacute;butante. With no career training, she took jobs as a cook-general in a variety of London houses. Then, at a chance meeting with a young publisher in 1937, she was encouraged to write about her experiences below stairs. Within three weeks she completed her first book, <span class="italic">One Pair of Hands</span>, which was an immediate success and earned the approbation of such influential figures as Compton Mackenzie and Malcolm Muggeridge. A humorous yet pointed depiction of the relationship between the upper classes and the servants, it revealed her keen eye for detail and her sense of the absurd.<br>
<br>Monica Dickens's first novel, <span class="italic">Mariana</span>, followed in 1940, and then in 1942, after she had taken up nursing as her war work, she wrote <span class="italic">One Pair of Feet</span>, based on her time at the Edward VII Hospital in Windsor. Before this was published, she moved to a factory as a fitter, making spare parts for Spitfires. Her novels <span class="italic">The Fancy</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">Thursday Afternoons</span> (1945) increased her reputation.<br>
<br>Praise came with every book, Monica Dickens's admirers at this time including J. B. Priestley, Rebecca West, and John Betjeman. She was becoming well established on the literary scene, and her novels were appearing at regular intervals. They included <span class="italic">The Happy Prisoner</span> (1946), <span class="italic">Joy and Josephine</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">Flowers on the Grass</span> (1949). <span class="italic">My Turn to Make the Tea</span> (1951) was inspired by her experiences as a junior reporter on a local newspaper. She was by now living in a thatched cottage called Bury End in the village of Hinxworth, Hertfordshire, where she kept horses and ponies and entertained her many friends from the Royal Ballet. For twenty years she wrote a weekly column for <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span>, and this brought her in touch with a readership of 9 million. Her articles were noted for their originality and common-sense approach.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1951 Monica Dickens married Commander Roy Olin Stratton (1900&#150;1985), US Navy, and went to live in Washington before settling into a large family house in the village of North Falmouth, on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The house, which could sleep at least fourteen, was often full. As well as their two adopted daughters, Pamela and Prudence, there were countless friends and family members who came to visit, including Monica Dickens's parents and her sister Doady. She was very close to her family, who called her by her childhood nickname, Monty.<br>
<br>Monica Dickens's books continued with, among others, <span class="italic">The Winds of Heaven</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">The Heart of London</span> (1961). <span class="italic">Cobbler's Dream</span> (1963) indulged her lifelong love of horses and was later made into a thirty-part television serial&#151;<span class="italic">Follyfoot</span>&#151;while <span class="italic">Kate and Emma</span> (1964) was arguably her most accomplished novel. Monica Dickens's popularity was explained not so much by her skills as a story-teller as by her ability to sketch characters that were instantly recognizable. A book signing session in Sydney in 1965 was the birth of the language known as Strine, when Monica Dickens asked, &#145;Shall I write someone's name in it?&#146; and the reply came, &#145;Emma Chisit&#146;. &#145;To Emma Chisit, with best wishes&#146;. &#145;No, Emma Chisit?&#146; &#145;Twenty-three shillings&#146;.<br>
<br>Between 1970 and 1971 Monica Dickens wrote a number of books for children, including the <span class="roman">World's End</span> series. These were followed by <span class="italic">Last Year when I was Young</span> (1974) and her autobiography, <span class="italic">An Open Book</span> (1978). In 1985 Roy Stratton died and Monica went back to her roots. In the village of Brightwalton, on the Berkshire downs, she found a thatched cottage that closely resembled her beloved Bury End. Here she entered her &#145;third age&#146;, surrounded by friends, family, dogs, and a garden overlooking a glorious valley. Novels written at this time included <span class="italic">Dear Doctor Lily</span> (1988), <span class="italic">Scarred</span> (1991), and her last book, <span class="italic">One of the Family</span>, which was published in 1993.<br>
<br>Her curiosity about people and her ability to empathize with their problems, combined with her deep understanding of human behaviour, led Monica Dickens, in the early 1970s, to become a Samaritan. She had great admiration for the Samaritans' founder, the Revd Chad Varah, and in 1974 she opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts. Other branches followed, and, owing to her inspiration and persistence, the Samaritans eventually became a thriving organization throughout the United States. Her novel <span class="italic">The Listeners</span> (1970) was based on her experiences with the Samaritans in London. She said becoming a Samaritan was simply the most important thing she had ever done  (Grove, 122). In 1981 she was appointed MBE.<br>
<br>Monica Dickens was modest enough to put much of her success down to &#145;unbelievable luck&#146;, but all her life she was determined to succeed. When things went wrong, her attitude was a brisk &#145;What's next?&#146; She was warm, wise, and strong, sometimes stubborn, but always witty. When operated on for bowel cancer, she wrote to a friend, &#145;It's not a full stop&#151;just a semi-colon&#146;  (Grove, 128). For Monica Dickens, a worthy descendant of her famous great-grandfather, not only on account of her literary skills, but also because of her strong sense of humanity, the full stop came two years later, in 1992, at the BUPA Dunedin Hospital, Reading. It was Christmas day. She was cremated and her ashes scattered a week later, on 1 January 1993.<br>
