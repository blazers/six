<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Close, Sir  Charles Frederick  Arden-</span>  (1865&#150;1952), <span class="occ">surveyor and geographer</span>, was born on 10 August 1865 at St Saviour's, Jersey, the eldest of the eleven children of Captain (later Major-General) Frederick Close (1830&#150;1899) and his second wife, Lydia Ann Stevens. He was educated at a dame-school in Rochester, then at Thompson's school, Jersey, and at a crammer, passing second into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1882. He excelled in mathematics, and in 1884 he passed out first, with the Pollock memorial medal, was commissioned in the Royal Engineers, and joined the School of Military Engineering, Chatham. After a year (1886) in Gibraltar he was first attached to and later commanded the balloon section at Chatham (1887&#150;8). He was next posted to India where he served one year on battery construction for the Hooghly defences and then four years (1889&#150;93) with the survey of India, engaged on topographic work in Upper Burma and geodetic triangulation on the Mandalay primary series (Toungoo-Katha) and the Mong Hsat secondary series up to the Siam border.<br>
<br>Returning to Chatham, Close was sent in the next year (1895) to west Africa to survey the boundary between the Niger Coast Protectorate and the German Cameroons. On his return he was appointed to the Ordnance Survey and in 1898 was made British commissioner to delimit the frontier of British Central Africa and Northern Rhodesia with German East Africa for over 200 miles between lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika. He collaborated with David Gill, HM astronomer at the Cape, in relation to longitude fixation of points on the German frontier. He was appointed CMG in 1899. Next year he led a small survey detachment for the South African War, for which practically no maps existed. It is claimed that this survey unit produced the first multicoloured map to be printed by lithography in the field by the British army. In 1902&#150;5 he was chief instructor in surveying at Chatham. There he introduced new methods and revised his earlier work, <span class="italic">Text Book of Military Topography</span>, part 2 (1898), to produce the <span class="italic">Text Book of Topographical and Geographical Surveying</span> (1905) which, with later revisions, remained the standard work for the next half-century.<br>
<br>By 1905 Close had very wide practical experience of surveying, both geodetic and topographic, in three continents, as well as firsthand knowledge of international boundary surveys and settlements. In that year he became head of the topographical (from 1907 geographical) section, general staff, at the War Office, of which a major concern was overseas maps. He pressed, with success, for the formation of the colonial survey committee (August 1905) and for surveying in British colonies. Close and his directors in MI4, having experienced in South Africa the disadvantages of waging war without maps, took the unprecedented step of preparing maps of a probable European theatre of war. He was to recall that:<blockquote>it was whilst we were drawing these maps that Mr Haldane, the Secretary of State, came round the GSGS. When he saw the maps of France and Belgium he turned to me and said &#145;You will never want those&#146;. (Institution of Royal Engineers, May 1933)</blockquote>Thanks to the foresight of the geographical section, the British army entered the First World War better supplied with maps than in any previous conflict. An even wider project was the <span class="roman">Carte Internationale du Monde au Millioni&egrave;me</span>&#151;first proposed in 1891 and exhaustively discussed later but with little progress. With support from the War and Foreign offices, Close arranged a meeting of the newly formed international map committee at the Foreign Office in 1909, attended by delegates of the great powers, at which concrete proposals were made. The large number of maps eventually published on this system is a tribute to Close's driving power.<br>
<br>Close was appointed director-general of the Ordnance Survey on 18 August 1911. He found the organization &#145;rather out of touch with the scientific world&#146;. He proceeded with a second geodetic levelling of the United Kingdom, creating &#145;fundamental&#146; bench marks which have been of lasting value. He also established three mean-sea level tidal stations&#151;at Dunbar, Newlyn, and Felixstowe, of which the second remains in operation. Close also turned his attention to the cartography of the Ordnance Survey with the intention of revolutionizing the appearance of the one-inch map. His first attempt, the <span class="italic">Killarney District</span> map (1913), was crowned with success. For artistic achievement in colour printing it remains unsurpassed by the Ordnance Survey. But the processes involved were too expensive in post-war Britain, and a simpler model was adopted for the one-inch map. This new style lacked the coloured layers, hill-shading, and hachures of the Irish sheet, but, with a smaller contour interval and revised road classification system, it set the pattern for all subsequent one-inch series. In 1919, Close secured the appointment of a civilian archaeology officer, O. G. S. Crawford, resulting in a highly acclaimed series of historical maps of which the first was <span class="italic">Roman Britain</span> (1924). In 1913 Close had married Gladys Violet (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Theodore Henry Percival, formerly of the India Office. They had one daughter and two sons. Close had become a parent in later life but, even in his late fifties and early sixties, was always ready to play football with his sons. This thoughtfulness for the well-being of others extended from his own family&#151;he had been constant in giving financial help to his mother and siblings&#151;to those in his employ. He was affectionately known as Pa Close in the army, and he instituted the system of staff rewards for innovative ideas in the Ordnance Survey.<br>
<br>In 1914 Close delivered the Halley lecture at Oxford which was incorporated in his &#145;Notes on the geodesy of the British Isles&#146; (Ordnance Survey professional paper no. 3). During the First World War the Ordnance Survey printed 32 million maps for the armies in France and elsewhere. Close, who had been promoted major (1901), lieutenant-colonel (1908), and colonel (1912), periodically visited the western front. After the war Close had the disagreeable task of implementing drastic cuts in the Ordnance Survey establishment which had been recommended by the Geddes committee. A direct result of this was that the large-scale plans fell massively into arrears by the 1930s.<br>
<br>Close retired in 1922, and in the many productive years still before him he devoted himself to his family and to work on geographical and kindred matters. In 1911 he had been president of section E (geography) of the British Association, giving a controversial address in which he stated that much of the subject matter then studied by geographers was more properly the province of other disciplines  (&#145;Report 18&#146;, <span class="italic">British Association</span>, 1911, 436&#150;43). It was regarded by his professional geographical contemporaries as &#145;geographical heresy&#146;  (RGS, Close MSS, 1911). However, he served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society (1904&#150;40), and was Victoria gold medallist (1927) and president (1927&#150;30). He was chairman of the national committee for geography and general secretary of the International Geographical Union, being president in 1934&#150;8. He was first treasurer (1919&#150;30) then chairman of the Palestine Exploration Fund (1930&#150;45), and president of the Hampshire Field Club (1929&#150;32 and 1935&#150;6). In 1927, when president of the Geographical Association, he addressed that body with a lecture entitled &#145;Population and migration&#146;. He was the author of about fifty publications on topics ranging from geodesy and map projections, history of cartography, and meteorology to population studies. Among these were: <span class="italic">The Early Years of the Ordnance Survey</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The Map of England</span> (1932), &#145;A fifty years retrospect&#146;, <span class="italic">Empire Survey Review</span> (vol. 1, 1932, and vol. 2, 1933&#150;4), and &#145;Our crowded island&#146;, <span class="italic">Eugenics Review</span> (April 1948). He was president of the International Union for the Scientific Investigation of Population Problems in 1931&#150;7. He also taught mathematics at Winchester College during the Second World War, standing in for staff who were employed on military service.<br>
<br>Close was elected FRS in 1919; received an honorary ScD from Cambridge (1928); and was an honorary member of the Russian, German, Belgian, Dutch, Spanish, and Swiss geographical societies. He was appointed CB in 1916 and KBE in 1918; he was an officer of the order of Leopold, and a member of the Afghan order of Astaur. He changed his name to Arden-Close by deed poll in 1938 in order to comply with the terms of a bequest. Arden-Close died at the Enniskerry Nursing Home, Sleepers Hill, Winchester, on 19 December 1952. His contribution to the cartography and history of the Ordnance Survey was recognized in 1980 with the formation of a society named after him: The Charles Close Society for the Study of Ordnance Survey Maps.<br>
