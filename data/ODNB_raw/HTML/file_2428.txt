<span class="headword">Birch,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1800?), <span class="occ">sectary and prophet</span>, was born in Wales, but nothing more is known about his early life. As a young man he moved to London, where he worked as a watch-motion maker, living in Brewer's Yard, Golden Lane, Old Street, and later in Little Moorfields. He had converted to the Muggletonians before 1 July 1759, when his name first appears in their records; his wife is mentioned on 22 July 1759. In December 1771 he wrote a verse account of his conversion and in the same year his name appears on the subscription list of <span class="italic">The Saint's Triumph, and the Devil's Downfall</span>, written by the Norwich Muggletonian John Brown.<br>
<br>About 1772 Birch was responsible for a serious secession in the Muggletonian ranks. Believing that the Muggletonians had lost their sense of urgency and immediacy he sought to revive the original doctrines of John Reeve who, together with his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton, had founded the sect in 1652. To Birch the issue of &#145;immediate notice&#146;, which Muggleton had rejected, was fundamental, for he shared Reeve's belief that God was an interventionist who took immediate notice of human actions, and thus upheld the efficacy of prayer. In endorsing the doctrine of immediate notice Birch attracted a certain following and led a party within the sect, which had experienced previous eruptions of Reevite heresy. Only when in 1778 Birch claimed to be the new prophet of the movement after God had spoken directly to him did separation become inevitable. Birch and his &#145;high priest&#146;, William Matthews of Bristol, were denounced as false prophets, and their followers, the Birchites, were known as the anti-church. Ten of his own followers, led by Martha Collier, withdrew from the Birchites but, still believing in immediate notice, were rejected by the orthodox Muggletonians.<br>
<br>At the height of his influence Birch led a group of between fifty and sixty followers, about thirty of whom were based in London. Most of the others lived in south Wales, particularly in Pembrokeshire. Numbers dwindled in the early nineteenth century and the Birchites had practically disappeared by mid-century; two followers were still alive in 1871. The last occurrence of Birch's name in the Muggletonian archives is in 1795, but about 1800 he published &#145;two strange and incoherent books&#146;, <span class="italic">The book of cherubical reason, with its law and nature, or, Of the law and priesthood of religion</span> and <span class="italic">The Book upon the Gospel and Regeneration</span>, which, according to Alexander Gordon, &#145;read like the productions of a madman&#146;  (Gordon, &#145;Ancient and Modern Muggletonians&#146;, 52). Birch is believed to have died in October 1800, probably in London.<br>
