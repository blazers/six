<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Monkhouse,  Robert Alan <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>  (1928&#150;2003), <span class="occ">entertainer and comedian</span>, was born at 168 Bromley Road, Beckenham, Kent, on 1 June 1928, the younger son of Wilfred Adrian Monkhouse (<i>d</i>. 1957), a company head accountant, and his wife, Dorothy Muriel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hansard (<i>d</i>. 1969). His relationship with both parents was what would later be described as a dysfunctional one: a lonely, fat child, he later recalled his mother embracing him only once, on the occasion of a wartime bomb landing near the Morrison shelter in which they had taken refuge. What little affection he received came mainly from his paternal grandfather, who was the head of Monk and Glass custard powder manufacturers in Birmingham. His death when Monkhouse was aged nine affected the latter so deeply that he was unable to speak for three months and developed a pronounced stutter. None the less he was determined to strike out on his own, a reaction to what he later described as an &#145;atmosphere of &#147;Some day, son, all this custard will be yours&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 30 Dec 2003).<br>
<br>Monkhouse attended Dulwich College, where his natural predilection for writing jokes and quips combined with his father's facility for diligence and systematic record keeping soon resulted in his regularly contributing gags and cartoons to children's comics like <span class="italic">The Beano</span> and <span class="italic">The Dandy</span>. From this he graduated to writing racy pornographic novels for the troops under a variety of fictional names such as Ramon Le Croix. He later claimed to have written a million words while at the college under ten aliases, and it was there too that he linked up with his first writing partner, Denis Goodwin, with whom as well as writing gags he also later persuaded their secretary to pose nude so they could subsequently sell the prints in Oxford Street. By then Monkhouse had left school, aged seventeen, to work as a cartoon film animator with Gaumont British, followed by national service in the RAF.<br>
<br>Monkhouse's mother told him she would not have him in the house if he pursued a career in showbusiness, but Monkhouse defied her, writing jokes for an impressive list of stars including Bob Hope, Ted Ray, and Jimmy Edwards. On 5 November 1949 he further provoked his parents' ire by marrying Elizabeth Thompson, whom he had met while in the RAF. She was the daughter of Thomas James Thompson, cabinet maker, and was a year older than Monkhouse. His mother so strongly disapproved of the union that she attended the wedding in black, and despite Monkhouse and his new wife suffering four premature births and the birth of a son, Gary, with cerebral palsy, neither of his parents spoke to him for the next seventeen years. Monkhouse and his wife had another son, Simon, and adopted a daughter, Abigail.<br>
<br>Monkhouse's partnership with Goodwin was enormously prolific, and led to their securing their own series, <span class="italic">Fast and Loose</span>, in 1954. Unlike many programmes of the day the humour was character-driven rather than derived from well-trodden comic routines. In 1957 Monkhouse made his first appearance in a quiz show, <span class="italic">What's My Line?</span>, a genre that he ultimately made his own. In 1958 he made the first of twelve film appearances, in <span class="italic">Carry On Sergeant</span>. He made occasional forays onto the West End stage, and in 1960 was the host of <span class="italic">Candid Camera</span>, a forerunner of many &#145;gotcha&#146; shows in which unsuspecting members of the public were the victims of ornate practical jokes.<br>
<br>Despite a ferocious work rate, by 1967 Monkhouse's career had stalled. But when he was booked to comp&egrave;re a single edition of the long-running TV show <span class="italic">Sunday Night at the London Palladium</span> his enthusiastic presence and polished delivery revived the ailing show and led to his best-known role, as host of <span class="italic">The Golden Shot</span> (1967&#150;71 and 1974&#150;5), a ludicrous but hugely popular series (attracting audiences of up to 17 million) in which contestants directed by telephone a blindfolded crossbowman to hit a target for cash. Monkhouse's talent for ad-libbing was frequently called upon, as was his skill as a cartoonist. (He drew many of the cartoon targets himself.) From then on Monkhouse became associated with the successful piloting of a whole string of popular family quiz shows including <span class="italic">Celebrity Squares</span> (1975&#150;9) and <span class="italic">Family Fortunes</span> (1979&#150;83). Although his smug, oleaginous persona and &#145;perma-tan&#146; complexion were often ridiculed (in fact the tan was not through vanity but to disguise vitiligo, a severe pigmentation disorder), he remained among the highest-paid television entertainers into the mid-1990s, ensuring a career at the top of showbusiness for five decades. As he once said with typical wit and self-deprecation, &#145;They laughed when I told them I wanted to become a comedian: they're not laughing now&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 30 Dec 2003).<br>
<br>Yet beneath the outward success Monkhouse's private life saw much unhappiness. His first marriage was dissolved in 1971. His elder son, Gary, died in 1993, and Simon, with whom he had not spoken for thirteen years, died from a heroin overdose in 2001. By then, however, Monkhouse had found a measure of stability and happiness in his marriage to his former secretary, Jacqueline (Jackie) Harding, daughter of William Henry Harding, electrical engineer; they married on 4 October 1973, when she was aged thirty-seven. There were no children of this second marriage.<br>
<br>Even at the end of his life Monkhouse still maintained both a vigorous work ethic (he was a frequent live entertainer and after-dinner speaker, and did much work for charity) and a prodigious rate of alcohol consumption. He published two volumes of autobiography interspersed with thoughtful reflections on the art of comedy, <span class="italic">Crying with Laughter</span> in 1993 and <span class="italic">Over the Limit</span> in 1998. Among other interests he was a voracious collector of matchbooks, comic strips, and early films (amassing what was reputed to be the best private collection of early films in the country). &#145;I still enjoy sex at 74&#146;, he once said; &#145;I live at 75, so it's no distance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Dec 2003). Only in his last years did he become universally recognized by generations young and old as a giant of entertainment. He was appointed OBE in 1993. His final two and a half years were spent battling against prostate cancer. He died on 29 December 2003 at his home, Claridges, Eggington, Bedfordshire, and was survived by his wife, Jackie, and daughter, Abigail. On the prospect of his own death he once commented &#145;I want to die like my father, peacefully in his sleep, not screaming and terrified, like his passengers&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
