<span class="headword">Owen,  Griffith</span>  (<em>c.</em>1647&#150;1717), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and colonial official</span>, was the son of Robert Owen (1628&#150;1685/6) of Dolsereau, near Dongelly, Merioneth, and his wife, Jane Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1685/6). Nothing is known of his early years but he appears to have been granted a bishop's licence on 16 May 1674 to practise medicine. On 23 October 1678 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of William Barnes. They had four sons and seven daughters. Owen seems to have resided in Prescot, Lancashire, and was a member of the Knowsley meeting and Hardshaw monthly meeting. In 1680 and 1681 he was distrained for a refusal to pay tithes, and in 1681 was convicted at the Lancashire assizes, presumably under the penal laws. In May 1681 he was one of a group of Welsh Quakers who met William Penn to consider the proposed creation of a Welsh barony in Pennsylvania; on 13 March 1684 the Welsh Company received a grant of 40,000 acres, of which Owen purchased 500 acres. On 27 May 1684 he received a certificate of removal from Hardshaw monthly meeting, and emigrated to Pennsylvania, together with his parents and siblings. He arrived in Philadelphia on 17 September 1684, and by 13 November he was attending the Radnor monthly meeting. He originally settled in the Welsh tract, before moving to Merion, and then into Philadelphia itself.<br>
<br>Owen quickly made an impact in Pennsylvania, serving as a member of the colonial assembly in 1686&#150;9, during which time he was a noted defender of the rights of Welsh tract proprietors. He was a member of the provincial council in 1690&#150;92. From 1692 he was at the forefront of attempts to rebut the charges of the apostate George Keith, and in 1695 he chaired the committee that produced and published in Pennsylvania <span class="italic">Our Ancient Testimony Renewed</span>. With the arrival of a new governor in 1693 he seems to have eschewed politics, declining appointment as a JP, and embarking on several religious tours encompassing Maryland and Virginia in 1694. In 1695&#150;7 he visited England in the company of Thomas Janney, visiting London, and leaving the latter at Chester for a journey into Wales. Having returned to Philadelphia by 1699 he was instrumental in combating an outbreak of the &#145;Barbados distemper&#146; which threatened to decimate the colony.<br>
<br>In 1700 Owen was elected to the provincial council, and when the elected council was dissolved he was appointed by Penn to its successor, serving until his death. In September 1701 he helped form the meeting of the ministers of Philadelphia, which became the meeting of ministers and elders. He attended regularly the Philadelphia yearly meeting, often acting as chairman. Just prior to Penn's departure from the colony, in October 1701, he served as a councillor and as one of four commissioners of property. Owen was normally reluctant to become heavily involved politically, but he did help to defend Penn's interests in the colony.<br>
<br>Owen's wife died on 22 December 1702, and he married again on 30 November 1704. His second wife was Sarah (1664&#150;1733), daughter of John Songhurst, who originated from Sussex, and the widow of Zachariah Whitpaine and Charles Saunders (<i>d</i>. 1699), a colonial agent of the New Pennsylvania Company, whom she had married in Philadelphia on 8 February 1698. Owen continued to attend council meetings regularly between 1701 and 1705, but rarely thereafter until he returned from a visit to New England in 1709. In March 1711 he took part in negotiations with the American Indians at Conestoga. He died in Philadelphia on 18 August 1717, three sons acting as executors. Two of his sons practised medicine, and a daughter, Rebecca, served in the Quaker ministry.<br>
