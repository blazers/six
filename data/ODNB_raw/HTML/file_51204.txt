<span class="headword">Younger, Sir  William McEwan, of Fountainbridge</span>, baronet  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">brewer and political activist</span>, was born at Ravenswood, Melrose, Roxburghshire, on 6 September 1905, the second son in a family of two sons and one daughter of William Younger (1857&#150;1925), brewer, of Ravenswood, Melrose, and his wife, Katharine Theodora (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of Commander Adam Alexander Duncan Dundas, 27th chief of Dundas, naval officer. His father was the brother of George Younger, first Viscount Younger, and of Robert Younger, Baron Blanesburgh; his paternal grandmother, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McEwan, was the eldest sister of William McEwan, Gladstonian Liberal MP for Edinburgh and the founder of McEwan's Brewery. He was thus brought up with a background of brewing and politics, and heavily influenced by an atmosphere of free trade and competition. He was educated at Winchester College, but blossomed during his time at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1924 to 1928. While at Oxford he was introduced to mountaineering and he became an accomplished rock-climber in the Alps, the Lake District, and the Cuillins, and was on the shortlist, though not selected, for the Everest expedition of 1928. For a not overconfident young man, the acquisition of skill and daring learned in rock climbing, together with the general ethos of the pursuit of excellence inherent in a Balliol education, produced a spirit ready to challenge existing attitudes in both commerce and politics. He graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1928.<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford, Younger (known as Bill) joined the firm of Wm McEwan &amp; Co., brewers, of which his father had been the managing director. He learned his trade from the bottom, with spells as maltman, shift brewer, and salesman. Part of his training took place in London, where he stayed in the house of the celebrated <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51986/', "Dame Margaret Greville")</script>, Edwardian hostess and heir and presumed daughter of William McEwan. Dame Margaret was so impressed by the young man that when she died she left him all her ordinary shares, though they were at that time unquoted.<br>
<br>In 1931 the Edinburgh brewing firms of Wm Younger (not a relative) and Wm McEwan amalgamated with a joint equity as Scottish Brewers Ltd but in trade continued to compete fiercely with each other. However, the older William Younger was still very much the senior partner and Younger found his radical business ideas had to be suppressed. On 24 June 1936 he married Nora Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1916), eldest daughter of Brigadier Edward William Sturgis Balfour and Lady Ruth Balfour of Balbirnie; there was one daughter, Caroline Ruth, born in 1946. In 1937 Younger joined the Royal Artillery, in the Territorial Army. When war came in 1939 he quickly rose to be a major in the 40th light anti-aircraft (LAA) battery and in November 1940 he was sent to the Middle East. While in command of the LAA battery he took part in the first siege of Tobruk, where his valiant and original air defence of the fortress earned him the DSO. He was subsequently promoted lieutenant-colonel commanding the 14th LAA regiment, took part in the remainder of the north African campaign, and, after landing at Salerno, followed the war in Italy until the armistice. Known by his men as Colonel Screwtop, the main supplier of beer to the army being McEwan Youngers, he returned from the war with greatly increased self-confidence and a determination to put his radical ideas to the test.<br>
<br>Younger stood twice as the tory candidate for West Lothian, a seat almost certainly unattainable for a conservative, but after defeat in the 1950 election he confined his political ambitions to work for the party and concentrated his main efforts on brewing.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war years the brewing industry was dominated by family-owned companies. The relaxation of rationing allowed much increased production from existing equipment, and consumption rose rapidly. The main place of sale was the public house; lager was a minor brand and cans had only just begun. As the families of the many smaller, family-owned brewers sought to realize the value of their investments, these breweries fell into the hands of larger companies seeking to enlarge the number of their tied outlets. The process was accelerated in the late 1950s when the Canadian brewer Ed Taylor started to buy up individual companies and amalgamate them to make larger groups. The whole industry was thrown into turmoil, and many firms sought protection by running for cover to larger groups.<br>
<br>In Scotland the situation was somewhat different. The tenanted public house was a rarity and customers were tied to a brewery by loans, often at lower than commercial rates. A large proportion of the trade was completely free and depended on the marketing of individual brands. Younger, by now managing director of Scottish Brewers Ltd, saw this as an opportunity, concentrated on the free trade, and developed brand marketing to an extent not previously seen in the industry. He encouraged the development of the can, which was particularly suited to the growing trade in off-licences and eventually supermarkets. Under his leadership Scottish Brewers Ltd became the dominant force in Scotland and the north of England.<br>
<br>Although many smaller brewers came to him for protection, Younger refused to buy except for cash, taking the view that the issue of shares would cause a dilution of shareholder equity. He believed strongly in competition, and when the main rival to Scottish Brewers Ltd in Scotland was offered to him he refused the offer on the basis that the resultant combine would so dominate the Scottish brewing scene as to extinguish competition and blunt the competitive edge of his company. His business philosophy was at variance with that of the rest of the brewing industry and he took no part in the councils of the various trade associations. In 1961 Newcastle Breweries joined the group. The name was changed to Scottish and Newcastle, and Younger became the chairman and managing director.<br>
<br>In spite of his education and background, Younger was anything but a conventional establishment figure. His business philosophy often consisted in seeing what the opposition was up to and then doing something completely different. Within the parameters of his policy directives, he allowed his subordinates to get on with their work without interference. Under his leadership the Scottish and Newcastle group developed rapidly during the 1960s, and the shareholding left him by Dame Margaret Greville made him a rich man. By 1970 he felt he needed a change, and he retired in order to devote himself to politics and his other business interests, and to dispose of a large part of his fortune. His marriage had started to fail in the 1960s and he was divorced in 1967.<br>
<br>Younger was the honorary secretary of the Scottish Unionist Association from 1955 to 1964, when he was made a baronet. In 1968 he and two colleagues were asked to go to Belfast to see whether Stormont could be a pattern for a Scottish assembly. The report was accepted by a large majority of Scottish tories and Edward Heath announced in 1970 in the declaration of Perth that there would be a Scottish assembly. Younger was chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland from 1971 to 1974 and worked closely with Heath. He was a left-centre tory and when Margaret Thatcher disavowed the declaration of Perth he withdrew.<br>
<br>Younger was a director of many Scottish businesses including the Scottish Widows Fund, the British Linen Bank, and Scottish Television, and was for several years chairman of the Scottish Investment Trust. He was the moving spirit behind the successful annual international forum of the Scottish Council (Development and Industry). He was a founder, trustee, and generous supporter of the Institute of Economic Affairs. In the 1950s he had given away his house at Balerno to the Save the Children Fund. He now created the Craignish Trust, one of the chief beneficiaries being Balliol College, as a result of which he was made an honorary fellow, a distinction of which he was immensely proud.<br>
<br>In 1983 Younger married June Peck (<i>b</i>. 1933), but by now his health was starting to fail and he retired to Little Hill Cottage, Harpsden, Henley-on-Thames, where he died on 14 April 1992. He was cremated at Reading on 23 April, and was survived by his wife and the daughter of his first marriage.<br>
