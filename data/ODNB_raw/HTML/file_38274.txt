</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Frink, Dame  Elisabeth Jean</span>  (1930&#150;1993), <span class="occ">sculptor and printmaker</span>, was born on 14 November 1930 at The Grange, Thurlow, Suffolk, the only daughter of Ralph Cuyler Frink (1899&#150;1974), cavalry officer, and his wife, Jean Conway-Gordon (<i>b</i>. 1910), a colonel's daughter.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Frink's early years were spent travelling with her army father, who was serving with the 4th&#150;7th dragoon guards, to Shorncliffe, Kent, Salisbury Plain, Aldershot, and Edinburgh, but home remained at Thurlow. She had her first pony at three, and was riding at four, and then, through her father, became interested in dogs and guns. In 1940, when Frink was ten, her father was stationed at Kingston, Dorset, close to the Purbeck quarries and the magnificent ruin of Corfe Castle; both sites impressed her enough for her to make Dorset her home over thirty years later.<br>
<br>In 1941 Frink's mother sent her to Chypraze, near Exmouth, Devon, to stay with her godmother to avoid the planes and bombs in Suffolk, as Thurlow was surrounded by air stations. Frink started to draw when she was thirteen and her subjects were men on skeletal horses rendered in ink and wash, which she called &#145;apocalyptic&#146;. At sixteen, with her father confined in the army sanatorium at Midhurst, Surrey, she applied for and won a place at Guildford School of Art. In 1947 she started in the painting school, but moved over to sculpture, where the head of department was the sculptor Willi Soukop. At this time she was given a book on Rodin, and she later remembered that &#145;life began for me then&#146;.<br>
<br>At Guildford Frink learned to model in clay, and also to carve in wood and stone. Carving was too slow a method for her, and she abandoned it as a sculptural practice. She spent two years at Guildford and then applied to Chelsea School of Art in 1949, following Soukop, who had moved there in 1948. At Chelsea, where she studied from 1949 to 1953, she perfected her own method of modelling and carving in plaster of Paris, a practice used by the head of department there, Bernard Meadows, and also by Henry Moore, a visiting tutor who influenced her at that time. Her student sculptures were mainly men with birds and dogs, cast in cement or plaster.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>In 1951 Frink visited Paris for the first time and admired the recent work of Giacometti, Germaine Richier, and Picasso, all of whom made figurative sculptures in plaster. In 1952 she received her first major commission, a figure of St John Bosco (des.), for the new church of St John Bosco in Woodley, near Reading, Berkshire. Frink was brought up a Roman Catholic, and although she did not practise her religion regularly, she executed several major religious sculptural commissions throughout her career. The second work recorded in her <i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> was a large plaster figure of <span class="italic">Christ at the Pillar</span>.<blockquote>So far as the traditional iconography of religion is concerned, with its events and characters, I have accepted commissions to make crucifixions, altar crosses, a risen Christ in Solihull, a big Head of Christ for All Saints' Church, Basingstoke, an eagle lectern for Coventry Cathedral and a walking Madonna outside Salisbury Cathedral &hellip; I also did a larger than life-size figure of Judas in 1961, not through a commission but for myself &hellip; The religious impulse or acceptance or awareness must be there, but almost at an unconscious level&#151;and it is not only activated by commissions because the idea for Judas had absorbed me for some time as a formal, figurative embodiment of the idea of betrayal. (Shaffer, Robertson, and Kent, 33)</blockquote>Her last religious commission was her last work, <span class="italic">The Risen Christ</span>, for Liverpool Cathedral, unveiled by her son on Easter Sunday, 11 April 1993, a week before her death.<br>
<br>In 1952, while still a student, Frink exhibited with two other sculptors at the prestigious Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the Tate Gallery bought a small bronze, <span class="italic">Bird of Prey</span>, from the show, making her the youngest female artist to enter the national collections. In 1953 she won the student prize in the Unknown Political Prisoner sculpture competition. She taught at Chelsea School of Art from 1953 to 1961, at St Martin's School of Art from 1954 to 1962, and was visiting instructor at the Royal College of Art from 1965 to 1967. She was given her first solo show at St George's Gallery, London, in 1955 and overseas at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, New York, in 1959. Success came early in Frink's career and she was always newsworthy as the only prominent female sculptor in post-war London.<br>
<br>Frink married the architect Michel Jammet in September 1955 at the new church of Notre Dame de France, Leicester Place, London, with the reception at the Cavalry and Guards' Club in Piccadilly, a reminder of her army connections. His family were French and his grandfather, a chef, started the famous Jammet's restaurant in Dublin. As a result Frink and Michel Jammet were regular visitors to the city. Her only child, Lin, was born on 11 May 1958 at St Stephen's Hospital, London.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1950s British sculptors such as Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, Kenneth Armitage, and Eduardo Paolozzi gained international acclaim for their spiky, angst-ridden male figures in bronze or iron. They were a generation older than Frink and although her contemporary work was similar, her figures had a greater sense of strength and optimism than theirs. All the sculptors at this time shared a fascination with flight and flying creatures, probably as a result of wartime experiences, but Frink was the only one to continue the theme throughout her career. Her <i>&#339;uvre</i>, although large&#151;about 400 editioned bronzes&#151;kept to a small number of themes and variations, and she worked through her chosen subjects, such as birds or warriors, until their potential was exhausted.<br>
<br>Frink gave up her two full-time teaching jobs in 1962 in order to concentrate on work for exhibitions and commissions. One major commission was to make the eagle lectern for the new Coventry Cathedral. The eagle of St John is the usual subject for ecclesiastical lecterns, but the subject of a mighty bird was also one which fitted in with Frink's obsessions. She was the youngest artist and the only female one to be commissioned to make new work for the cathedral, and her <span class="italic">Eagle</span> elicited much admiration. About the same time Frink gained the commission to make a memorial to the aviators Alcock and Brown for Manchester airport, and she produced a large figure, <span class="italic">Horizontal Birdman</span>, which conflated bird and man. When unveiled in 1962 it received much criticism, most notably from Alcock's elderly sister, who complained that the figure of her brother was &#145;obscene. At least my brother had his trousers on when he landed&#146;  (Gardiner, 133).<br>
<br>Frink divorced Michel Jammet in 1963 and at Wandsworth register office in the spring of 1964 married Edward Gordon Pool (1922&#150;2013), a former paratrooper whose family had a butchery business in Smithfield. In 1967 they sold their Chelsea home and moved to a group of abandoned farm buildings, Le Village, in the foothills of the C&eacute;vennes, near N&icirc;mes, France. In June 1973 Frink was divorced from Pool and returned to live and work in Britain, where she moved into a large apartment at Buckingham Gate, London. Her sculpture in the 1960s and 1970s concentrated on the nude male figure, and used it to reveal her deep concern with man's inhumanity to man. Numerous nude male figures stand or sit in postures that are both monumental and vulnerable. She also made a series of huge male heads. Living in southern France, she was very aware of the war in Algeria, and she records how a newspaper photograph of General Oufkir, a Moroccan murderer, wearing dark glasses caught her attention. The huge heads then turned into menacing heads wearing large goggles, which shaded their eyes, and thus their emotions. About this time she joined the human rights organization Amnesty International, of which she remained a committed member all her life. She was a generous supporter of charities, and gave drawings and etchings to Amnesty International and an edition of fifty casts of a sculpture of a seated dog to Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.<br>
<br>Frink made a large number of sculptures of animals, especially horses and dogs, ever favourite companions. Her horses and dogs were made with sensitivity and tenderness, and share none of the aggressiveness of the <span class="roman">Birds</span> series or the <span class="roman">Goggle Head</span> series. Although portraiture was not her favourite category of work, she did accept seven commissions between 1975 and 1984, including eminent male sitters such as Sir John Pope-Hennessy (for the British Museum), Sir Alec Guinness (for the National Portrait Gallery), and Michael Jaff&eacute; (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Critics have remarked that in many of her sculptured male heads there is an element of self-portraiture, and her own head, with its strong features, did have a masculine aspect in her later years. The sculptor F. E. McWilliam modelled a full-length portrait of her in 1956 (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Frink married Alexander Csaky, a Hungarian count and an insurance broker, in London in December 1974 and in 1976, when the lease on her Buckingham Gate studio expired, they bought Woolland House, Woolland, near Blandford Forum, Dorset, a large converted stable building with extensive gardens. In 1979 she had a studio built near the house and there made a life-size horse commissioned by the earl of March for Goodwood racecourse. This was one of her largest sculptures of a racehorse and it joined other bronze sculptures of horses, including one with a rider set on the pavement in Dover Street, London, in 1974, and one commissioned by Milton Keynes in 1978 (on Silbery Boulevard, outside Lloyds Bank).<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Frink became a member of the establishment in the late 1970s and early 1980s; appointed CBE in 1969, she was made DBE in 1982. She also became a trustee of the British Museum in 1975, a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission in 1976, and a Royal Academician in 1977. She became a Companion of Honour in 1992.<br>
<br>Frink's career included a lifelong commitment to drawing, sometimes for its own sake and sometimes in preparation for book illustrations: <span class="italic">Aesop's Fables</span> in 1968, Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> in 1972, the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> in 1978, and <span class="italic">Children of the Gods</span>, a book on Greek myths, in 1983. &#145;My illustrations have nothing to do with sculpture; neither activity helps the other, because the illustrations are subjective and my sculpture is not. The human form is not subjective&#146;  (Shaffer, Robertson, and Kent, 36).<br>
<br>Frink had a solo show every year from 1967, and her work was included in group shows around the world annually. She was given a retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1985, and a major show at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC, in 1990. Her work can be found in public collections throughout Britain, with a large collection of pieces at the Tate Gallery, and in major galleries in the USA, Australia, and South Africa. She died of cancer at Woolland House on 18 April 1993, two months after Alex Csaky had died of the same condition. In 1967 Frink stated that she moved to France in order &#145;to cut myself off from the British art scene&#146;  (Gardiner, 118). This small but significant statement reveals that she felt estranged from recent developments in British sculpture, which at that time included land art, performance art, and pieces constructed from industrial metal offcuts. Her primary theme, the human body, fell from favour as a subject for innovative sculpture in the 1960s, and Frink may have felt that her work would not have been appreciated by her native audience, or that her inspiration would be weakened by these new developments. In either case, she need not have worried. Her output remained as forceful and concentrated as ever, and as Bryan Robertson reminded the congregation in his address at her memorial service at St James's Church, Piccadilly, &#145;she achieved the extraordinary distinction of becoming, without compromising, a genuinely popular sculptor whose work is admired by a broad public in Britain and abroad.&#146; Her popularity stems from that fact that she did not embrace new techniques and technologies in order to make her sculpture, and that she remained utterly committed to conveying the nature and power of the human body, an inexhaustible subject for sculptural exploration.<br>
