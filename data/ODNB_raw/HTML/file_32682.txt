</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cushny,  Arthur Robertson</span>  (1866&#150;1926), <span class="occ">pharmacologist</span>, was born at Speymouth, Moray, on 6 March 1866, the fourth son of the Revd John Cushny, minister of the established church successively at Fochabers, Speymouth, and Huntly, and his wife, Catherine Ogilvie, daughter of Alexander Brown, procurator fiscal of Elgin. He was educated at Fochabers Academy and Aberdeen University, where he graduated MA in 1886 and MB, CM in 1889. At Aberdeen John Theodore Cash, regius professor of materia medica, aroused his interest in pharmacology. As holder of the George Thompson fellowship Cushny worked for a year at Bern under Hugo Kronecker, and later at Strasbourg under Oswald Schmiedeberg, then the most distinguished pharmacologist in Europe. From 1892 to 1893 he acted as Schmiedeberg's assistant, and in the latter year, on the recommendation of the American pharmacologist John Abel, was appointed, at the age of twenty-seven, to the chair of pharmacology in the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. In 1896 he married Sarah Firbank, an Englishwoman whom he had met in Strasbourg. She was the daughter of Ralph Firbank, a railway engineer. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1905 Cushny returned to England in order to become the first professor of pharmacology in University College, London. The chair was the first of its kind in England, designed to ensure emphasis on experimental pharmacology. In 1918 he succeeded Sir Thomas Fraser as professor of materia medica and pharmacology at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>While at Ann Arbor, Cushny continued researches, begun at Strasbourg, on the action of the digitalis glucosides, which involved also an investigation of the physiology of the mammalian heart&#151;subjects on which he wrote many papers, culminating in an exhaustive monograph, <span class="italic">The Action and Uses in Medicine of Digitalis and its Allies</span> (1925). In the course of these studies he incidentally suggested that the clinical condition known as <i>delirium cordis</i> might be identical with auricular fibrillation, a heterodox prediction which was verified ten years later as the result of the application of electrocardiographic methods to humans. The condition now known as auricular fibrillation has proved to be one of the most important diseases of the heart.<br>
<br>While in the United States, Cushny also began to study experimentally the functions of the kidneys and the action of diuretics. To this subject he made many valuable contributions, and published <span class="italic">The Secretion of Urine</span> (1st edn, 1917; 2nd edn, 1926), in which he co-ordinated the mass of contradictory evidence which had accumulated since Carl Ludwig's day, for which purpose, as he says in the preface, &#145;it was necessary to sift thoroughly this mass of printed matter of over 6,000 pages&#146;. His account of kidney secretion was accepted not only as the most authoritative critical review of past work, it also put forward a novel view of the functions of the kidney which was to serve as a foundation for further research, and is specially associated with Cushny's name.<br>
<br>In 1903 Cushny published his first study of the pharmacological actions of optical isomers, in which he showed that <i>l</i>-hyoxyamine is about twenty times as active as the <i>d</i>-isomer, and about twice as active as the <i>dl</i>-compound (atropine). Later he made similar quantitative studies of other optical isomers, which proved, as is now accepted, that two substances, identical in chemical composition and structure apart from their optical activity, may differ widely in pharmacological activity. He went on to demonstrate how complex the pharmacological action of optical isomers could be. Cushny summarized his own and other investigations on this subject in the Dohme lectures delivered at the Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore in 1925, published as <span class="italic">Biological Relations of Optically Isomeric Substances</span> in 1926.<br>
<br>These three subjects formed, perhaps, Cushny's chief scientific interests, and his contributions to them constitute his main claim to a permanent position in the history of his science. In addition he published a long and valuable series of monographs covering a wide field of pharmacological inquiry. In 1899 appeared the first edition of his <span class="italic">Textbook of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</span>, which went through eight editions in his lifetime. It was the first authoritative textbook to be written in English by an experimental pharmacologist, and it played an important part in guiding teaching and research during a period in which therapeutics was emerging from the mists of tradition and empiricism.<br>
<br>The originality of his researches, the authority of his writings, and his international friendships made Cushny one of the leading pharmacologists of his generation. He was a man large of mind, heart, and stature, outwardly austere, inwardly kindly, generous in helping others. He served on many commissions and international conferences, notably the royal commission on whisky and other potable spirits (1908). He received honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen and Michigan and was elected FRS in 1907 and to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1919. Cushny died suddenly of a cerebral haemorrhage at his home, Peffermill House, Edinburgh, on 25 February 1926. His wife and daughter survived him.<br>
