<span class="headword">Yexley,  Lionel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>James Woods]</span>  (1862&#150;1933), <span class="occ">naval reformer</span>, was born James Woods, on 9 July 1862 in Martin Street, Stratford, Essex, one of two children of James Woods, journeyman bootmaker, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yexley. He was educated at the Boys British School, Stratford. On 21 June 1878 he joined the navy as a boy seaman. Over the next twelve years he served in the Persian Gulf, East Indies, and Mediterranean, rising in 1890 to petty officer second class. While still an able seaman he married on 27 December 1884 Mary Ferry (1862&#150;1943); they had two children. With family responsibilities, he opted in 1890 to complete his twenty years for pension in the coastguard.<br>
<br>Woods began his journalistic career while in the coastguard, submitting anonymous articles to <span class="italic">Hope: The Coastguard Gazette</span> with complaints of service conditions. After narrowly escaping a court martial for his campaigning, he applied for early discharge in October 1897 in order to edit <span class="italic">The Gazette</span>. The following year he transformed the publication into a general lower-deck magazine and renamed it <span class="italic">The Bluejacket</span>. Writing as Lionel Yexley, his aim was to expose bad lower-deck conditions, many of them unchanged for decades. His writing, which drew on firsthand experience and information from serving men, highlighted such disabilities as the inadequacy of food rations, graft and corruption in shore depots, the lack of increase in pay since 1853, the harshness of punishment, and the absence of prospects for promotion from the lower deck. Though viewed by some as a subversive, he was not &#145;anti-navy&#146; but a patriotic advocate of a more modern, democratic service.<br>
<br>Yexley resigned from <span class="italic">The Bluejacket</span> in 1904, and in 1905 launched his own lower-deck monthly, <span class="italic">The Fleet</span>, in order to have greater editorial control. With his most productive reforming work about to begin, he settled at 8 York Road, Ilford, and remained in the district for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Fleet</span>'s initial target was the inadequacy of victualling. Yexley's trenchant criticisms soon attracted the attention of first sea lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who invited him to his home and was won over by his arguments. Between 1906 and 1909 Fisher presided over reforms in the feeding and clothing of sailors along lines proposed by Yexley. These entailed significant financial savings for ratings, the changes in victualling constituting arguably the biggest single improvement in the quality of lower-deck life in over half a century. Yexley's association with Fisher was now firmly established and they remained close until the latter's death.<br>
<br>Despite ready access to first lord of the Admiralty Reginald McKenna from 1909, the major improvements that Yexley sought in pay, punishments, and promotion were blocked by the more conservative sea lords. Not until the appointment of Winston Churchill as first lord in 1911 did the climate improve. In retirement Fisher was instrumental in bringing Churchill and Yexley together, and the subsequent close collaboration between the two yielded the most significant improvements in conditions. Meeting him for the first time in December 1911, Yexley convinced Churchill of the need for change in the interest of justice and to allay growing unrest among ratings. Prodded by Yexley, Churchill introduced in 1912 far-reaching improvements in the disciplinary code, promotion prospects, and pay.<br>
<br>Yexley was the chief witness before the 1912 Brock committee on naval punishments, whose recommendations prepared for wholesale change. <span class="italic">The Fleet</span>'s proposals for commissions for talented young petty officers provided the basis for Churchill's mate scheme. Moreover, the first substantive increase in pay in fifty-nine years announced in 1912 was also distributed on the basis of a formula that Churchill had asked Yexley to devise.<br>
<br>Despite his influence with Fisher and Churchill, Yexley was loathed by many in the naval establishment. When in 1914 <span class="italic">The Fleet</span> reported on lower-deck unrest in HMS <i>London</i> caused by harsh discipline, Captain Kemp brought a libel suit against Yexley. The action became a case of ward room versus lower deck, with fellow officers supporting Kemp financially and ratings in uniform appearing as defence witnesses. Yexley lost, was ordered to pay &pound;3000 damages (though Kemp subsequently waived these), and was bankrupted.<br>
<br>Amid growing agitation in the Grand Fleet in 1918, Yexley worked hard to prevent a proposed link between lower-deck benefit societies and the labour movement. In September he sent a memorandum on naval grievances to the king, the cabinet, and the Board of Admiralty arguing the case for judicious concessions to calm unrest. Despite MI5 suspicions of Yexley, shared by many in the Admiralty, the first lord took him seriously and met him to discuss his document. Then, to avert the possibility that the lower-deck societies would back the candidature of a rating as a Labour Party candidate in Portsmouth in the December general election, Yexley stood as an independent, changing his name by deed poll so as to enter the ballot under his professional name. He polled 7063 votes against the coalition candidate's 11,427. Coinciding with the declaration of the election result, Yexley also wrote an article for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> on the urgent need for a pay increase, a call supported editorially by J. L. Garvin. The following day the Admiralty announced the setting up of the Jerram committee on naval pay, whose recommendations in 1919 led to increases of 50&#150;80 per cent. Later, in September 1931, the abrupt withdrawal of the Jerram committee pay rises caused the Invergordon mutiny.<br>
<br>Yexley's influence declined in the 1920s, when his health began to fail. However, by then the most pressing reforms had been achieved. For twenty years he had been the foremost champion of the naval rating, but equally a vital safety valve for the naval establishment in times of unrest. As an advocate of lower-deck reform he was unequalled. Yexley died from kidney disease at his home, 143 Cranbrook Road, Ilford, on 18 March 1933. He was buried five days later at the City of London cemetery.<br>
