<span class="headword">Molyneux,  Edward Henry</span>  (1891&#150;1974), <span class="occ">couturier and art collector</span>, was born at 29 Greencroft Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 5 September 1891, the only son and second child of Justin Molyneux (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1864, <i>d</i>. in or before 1901), a commercial traveller, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kenny (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1869, <i>d</i>. in or after 1921). His parents were of Irish descent; his father was born in Kennington, in south-east London, and his mother in South Africa. By 1901 he, his sister Kathleen, and their widowed mother had moved to lodgings at 67 Cheriton Road, Folkestone. In the 1901 census his mother is described as living on her own means. In his teens Molyneux was educated at Beaumont College, a Jesuit boarding school near Windsor, but his education was cut short by the need to earn a living.<br>
<br>Molyneux's talent for drawing enabled him to find work as a fashion illustrator. His sketches were published in <span class="italic">The Planet</span> in 1909 and in the London edition of <span class="italic">The Smart Set</span> from November 1909 to September 1910. He was also employed as a sketch artist by the British couturier Lucile (Lady Lucy Christiana Duff Gordon) at her branches in London and New York. When she opened her Paris house in 1912 she promoted Molyneux to designer, commenting in her reminiscences that he was particularly gifted at creating extravagant costumes for the stage.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the First World War Molyneux joined the 9th battalion, Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) regiment. He served in France from 21 December 1915 as a temporary lieutenant and temporary captain. He was mentioned in dispatches three times and won the Military Cross, his wounds leading to the loss of sight in his left eye. After the war he was known as Captain Molyneux, or, in fashion circles, simply as the Captain.<br>
<br>In 1919, backed by the press baron Lord Northcliffe, Molyneux set up his own fashion house at 14 rue Royale, Paris. While the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>'s description of Molyneux as &#145;one of the foremost Paris Fashion &#147;Dictators&#148;&#146;  (advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 July 1920) only a year after his launch probably reflects its proprietor's financial interest in the fashion house, Molyneux's move to larger premises at 5 rue Royale in 1921 is evidence of his success. On 22 October 1921 he married (Jessie) Muriel Dunsmuir (1890&#150;1959), a daughter of James Dunsmuir and his wife, Laura Miller Surles, at the British consulate in Paris. James Dunsmuir was an industrialist and politician who served as the lieutenant-governor of British Columbia from 1906 to 1909. Molyneux and his wife divorced in 1924.<br>
<br>As well as creating luxurious clothes for the hedonistic lifestyle of international high society, Molyneux continued to design for the stage, dressing many of the leading actresses of the 1920s and 1930s, bringing his name and style to a wide audience. They included Gladys Cooper, whom he dressed from 1922, and, from 1923, Gertrude Lawrence, whom Molyneux described as &#145;quivering&#146; with chic  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Nov 1968). Molyneux had met Noel Coward in 1922 and the two collaborated on several productions, including <span class="italic">London Calling</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Private Lives</span> (1930), which starred Lawrence. Their friendship, although severely strained in the early 1950s, was long-lasting.<br>
<br>Molyneux was good looking, athletic, and affable and his commercial success enabled him to share the social life and extravagant lifestyle of his clients. In 1922 he set up a nightclub, the Acacia, at 7 rue des Acacias which he ran with the American writer and hostess Elsa Maxwell. After closing the Acacia, the partners opened a second club, Le Jardin de ma Soeur, in the rue Caumartin, near the Op&eacute;ra. The floor show starred the black entertainer Josephine Baker and the club was described by Anita Loos as &#145;the most elegant place in which to greet the Paris dawn&#146;  (Milbank, 148). In spite of its social success, thefts by staff led to the club's closure after two years. Molyneux also spent time in the south of France, the summer playground of the rich, owning a luxurious villa, La Capponcina, at Cap d'Ail. During the 1920s he opened branches in the fashionable resorts of Monte Carlo (1925), Cannes (1927), and Biarritz. In 1926 he introduced his first fragrance, Num&eacute;ro cinq.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Molyneux's design was at its most assured. His impeccably made and fitted clothes combined British understatement and French chic, and were characterized by simple elegance and graceful fluidity of line. Although he favoured navy blue and black, and crisp white collars, his style was restrained rather than severe. He knew when to introduce a vivid flash of colour and the polka dot became as much a signature as the carefully placed corsage that softened a waist or shoulder line. He influenced many younger designers who were to have successful careers, including the Irish-born John Cavanagh and Pierre Balmain, who trained with him in the 1930s, the British designer Hardy Amies, and Christian Dior.<br>
<br>The year 1934 was particularly successful for Molyneux. He designed Princess Marina of Greece's wedding dress and trousseau for her marriage to the duke of Kent and the stage costumes for the Paris production of <span class="italic">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</span>. The latter triggered a wave of Victorian and Edwardian styled fashions, which presaged Dior's &#145;new look&#146; of 1947. (Molyneux and Dior were also linked by their employment of Madame Bricard, whose style and taste influenced their design.) Molyneux opened a branch in London in 1932 at 60 Grosvenor Street, moving to 48 Grosvenor Street in 1936. The London house was managed by his sister Kathleen. His clothes were sold in the United States of America in leading department stores and he claimed that his house was the largest exporter of couture in Paris before the Second World War. In 1936 he introduced a Molyneux Sports line to add to his collections of day and evening wear, hats, furs, and fragrances. Molyneux's clients included some of the best-dressed women in the world, including Wallis Simpson (later duchess of Windsor), the Princess Faucigny-Lucinge, and Lady Diana Cooper. As Balmain remarked, this &#145;elegant, aloof Englishman &hellip; held the fashion world in the palm of his hand, during the nineteen-thirties&#146;  (Balmain, 53).<br>
<br>Following the German occupation of Paris in 1940 during the Second World War, Molyneux escaped to London via Biarritz. During the war he continued to design for the American market, sending two collections a year, raising valuable dollars for the British war effort. In 1941 he visited the United States of America on behalf of the Board of Trade to assess the American market for British silks, woollens, tweeds, and rayons. The following year he became a member and then chairman of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, holding the office until 30 December 1946. During his tenure the society worked with the Board of Trade to create a series of designs made according to government clothing regulations that could be used as templates by manufacturers.<br>
<br>In 1945 Molyneux returned to Paris. He had kept his house in Paris open for the duration of the occupation for the benefit of his staff. Although some of his customers were German he was an active supporter of the resistance, who benefited from the use of his yacht. In 1950, fearing that he was losing the sight of his remaining eye, he closed both his London and Paris houses and sold the rights to his fragrances. He retired to Jamaica where he was a leading member of the homosexual community in Montego Bay. The loss of his business and the diagnosis that the discomfort in his eye was nothing more serious than the result of overtiredness triggered a difficult period of readjustment for him. Drinking sharpened his temper but gradually he came to terms with retirement, finding great pleasure in painting. He was a talented artist and exhibited his paintings at the Galerie Andr&eacute; Weill in Paris and the Trafford Gallery in London in the 1950s and at the Hammer Galleries in New York in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Molyneux was also a discerning collector of art. Having made and sold a collection of eighteenth-century art, he moved on to collect small-scale French impressionist paintings. In 1952 his collection was exhibited in the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Many of these paintings had formerly hung in his modernist flat on the Quai d'Orsay, which was featured in the American magazine <span class="italic">Interior Style and Decoration</span> in 1937. In 1955 he sold his collection to the American collector Ailsa Mellon Bruce (1901&#150;1969), who in turn bequeathed her collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.<br>
<br>Molyneux utilized his talent for interior decoration in his many homes. In 1956 he built a new house at Biot in the Alpes Maritimes, where he cultivated carnations commercially for the French perfume industry. Noel Coward described the Domaine des Clausonnes as a &#145;dream&#146;, decorated in the &#145;most impeccable taste and immensely comfortable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 358). Molyneux's fashion houses, which were known for their subdued elegance, were decorated in a distinctive shade of pearl grey and he was the only couturier whose staff wore a uniform colour to match the d&eacute;cor.<br>
<br>In 1964 Molyneux decided to return to design, opening Studio Molyneux, selling high quality ready-to-wear, from a floor of his former house at 5 rue Royale. A group of French perfume manufacturers financed the new business. John Tullis, a second cousin, who was born in South Africa in 1923 and had worked for Molyneux before the Second World War, soon took over the direction of the collections. The first, shown in February 1965, was elegant and restrained and had little in common with contemporary fashion. Molyneux's decision to revive his career was ill advised as he had no sympathy for, or understanding of, the youthful fashions that typified the 1960s. He retired once more in 1969 and the business closed in 1977. Molyneux died on 23 March 1974 at his home in Monte Carlo, from double pneumonia following a heart attack. His commercial success and contribution to the fashion industry was recognized in 1950 when he was the first fashion designer to be appointed a royal designer for industry.<br>
