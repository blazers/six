<span class="headword">Luttrell <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>King]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1768&#150;1851), <span class="occ">wit and poet</span>, an illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17223/', "Henry Lawes Luttrell, second earl of Carhampton (1737&#150;1821)")</script>, was born on 14 May 1768 and baptized at St Martin in the Fields on 7 June 1768. His mother, Mary, was later known as Mary Otto Baijer Nugent; under the surname King he attended Charterhouse School between 1778 and 1783, before proceeding to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1790 and LLB in 1791, in which year he was called to the Irish bar. He took the name Luttrell, and through his father's influence he obtained a seat for Clonmines, co. Wexford, in the last Irish parliament (1798), and a post in the Irish government, which he subsequently commuted for a pension. He was sent to the West Indies about 1802 to manage his father's estates there, but soon returned, and obtained an introduction to London society through the duchess of Devonshire. Although always financially insecure, he was socially successful and was looked upon as one of the most agreeable, accomplished, and entertaining men of his day.<br>
<br>In 1819 Luttrell published some graceful, if rather colourless, elegiacs entitled <span class="italic">Lines Written at Ampthill Park in the Autumn of 1818</span>, and dedicated to Henry, Lord Holland. On an altogether different plane was <span class="italic">Advice to Julia, a Letter in Rhyme</span>, published early in 1820. Influenced by Horace, the poem was a &#145;society epic&#146;, offering vignettes of London life. Tom Moore, who was to some extent its literary sponsor, described the volume as &#145;full of well-bred facetiousness and sparkle&#146;; it was greatly improved in the third edition of 1822 (when the title was slightly altered to <span class="italic">Letters to Julia, in Rhyme</span>), and &#145;is now&#146;, said Christopher North, writing in the following year, &#145;quite, quite a bijou&#146;. Luttrell's only other printed volume was his <span class="italic">Crockford House</span> (1827), a satire on gambling which did not enhance his reputation.<br>
<br>Luttrell travelled much in Europe, and kept a diary, but his real greatness was as a talker and diner-out. Moore took counsel with him before destroying the manuscript memoirs which Byron had entrusted to his discretion. He was &#145;always bracketed with Rogers&#146;, compared with whom he is described as &#145;less caustic, but more good-natured&#146;, and the two were &#145;seldom apart, and always hating, abusing, and ridiculing each other&#146;. No one, according to Rogers, &#145;could slide in a brilliant thing with greater readiness&#146;. He was a frequent guest at Holland House, where many of his best <i>mots</i> were uttered [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93786', "Holland House set")</script>]. Despite his great reputation as a wit, and his contemporaries' taste for recording his epigrams, they did not withstand translation into written form. He appears in many volumes of recollections of the period. He did not lack a serious side: Greville described him as &#145;a philosopher in all things, but especially in religion&#146;.<br>
<br>Luttrell survived most of his contemporaries, and was described by Raikes in 1843 as visiting Paris &#145;pour chasser l'ennui, though without effect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portion of the Journal</span>, 4.269). In 1850 he married Ann Springer, daughter of John Cutler of Clapton. It is possible that he had been married previously. He died at his house, 31 Brompton Square, London, on 19 December 1851.<br>
