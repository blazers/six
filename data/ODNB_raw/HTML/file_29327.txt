<span class="headword">Whittingham,  Charles</span>  (1795&#150;1876), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born on 30 October 1795 at Mitcham, Surrey, the son of Samuel Whittingham, nurseryman. At the instigation&#151;and most likely at the expense&#151;of his father's younger brother in London, the printer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29326/', "Charles Whittingham (1767&#150;1840)")</script>, he attended the Islington academy of the Revd John Evans, and on 2 October 1810 was bound apprentice to his uncle, who had recently taken premises at Chiswick. He became free of the Stationers' Company on 4 November 1817, and in 1818 was made a liveryman of the company. He remained in his uncle's printing office for the next ten years, and in 1824 the two men entered into an informal partnership; this was dissolved in August 1828, when the younger Whittingham left Chiswick to set up his own printing shop at 21 Tooks Court, off Chancery Lane in Holborn.<br>
<br>The elder Whittingham provided his breakaway nephew with two secondhand iron presses and about 1200 pounds of well-used type; he also lent him nearly &pound;1500, charging interest at the rate of 5 per cent. Young Charles paid his first wages bill on 23 August 1828, and within two years the new business was employing a dozen men and showing a profit. At a time when rival establishments such as Spottiswoodes and Clowes were filling vast press rooms with steam-powered printing machines, Whittingham chose instead to follow his uncle in retaining the iron hand-press and concentrating on the production of small editions distinguished for their tasteful design and excellent presswork. Throughout his career he relied on a small number of customers, many of them publishers and individuals or societies who shared his aesthetic concerns; other clients, including the Religious Tract Society and a half-dozen almanac publishers, were taken over from his uncle and provided a steady and undemanding source of income.<br>
<br>Soon after his move to Tooks Court, Whittingham made the acquaintance of the bookseller and publisher William Pickering (1796&#150;1854), who became his most important customer as well as his close friend. From about 1830 Pickering began sending most of his work to Whittingham, and was soon providing over half the business that entered the Tooks Court shop. In large part, the books that he printed for Pickering have served to confirm Whittingham's reputation as the finest English commercial printer of the nineteenth century. Much of the credit for the typographic design of the books may belong to Pickering, but it was Whittingham's craftsmanship, particularly in the area of presswork, that ensured the success of such projects as Pickering's 1833 <span class="italic">Dance of Death</span> and his 1844 folio blackletter reprints of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> from six early editions. For these and other books Whittingham commissioned initials and headpieces from the wood-engraver Mary Byfield (1795&#150;1871), suggesting as models alphabets and ornaments employed by sixteenth-century English and continental printers.<br>
<br>With Pickering, Whittingham also began in the late 1830s the typographic experiments that led to the revival of the old face roman types of William Caslon, which had been superseded in the early years of the century by the more fashionable &#145;modern&#146; faces. The reintroduced Caslon type was used first in 1840 for five Pickering title-pages, and in 1843 Whittingham began work on two books employing Caslon as the principal text type, Hannah Mary Rathbone's <span class="italic">Diary of Lady Willoughby</span>, published by Longmans in 1844, and an edition in 1845 of Juvenal's <span class="italic">Satires</span>, an Eton prize book overseen by Pickering. Later, Whittingham commissioned three types for the private use of his printing office: a recutting of one of William Caxton's types (1847); the Basel roman, based on sixteenth-century designs (1850); and a less historically accurate Aldine italic and roman (1856). A distinctive house style, combining proprietary and carefully chosen foundry types with Whittingham's unique stock of borders and initials, was fully evolved by the 1850s, and may be seen to full advantage in such works as the 1853 Queen Elizabeth <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> printed for Pickering, William Calvert's <span class="italic">The Wife's Manual</span> (Longmans, 1854), and a second <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> employing borders based on the designs of Geoffroy Tory (Longmans, 1864). Unsurpassed in colour printing from woodblocks, Whittingham produced several books for Henry Shaw, including his 1842 <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Ornament</span>, as well as a number of colour-printed gift books and the eccentric but dazzling 1847 <span class="italic">Elements of Euclid</span>, in which Oliver Byrne attempted to expedite the teaching of geometry through the use of colour diagrams.<br>
<br>In 1826 Whittingham married Eleanor Hulley (<i>d</i>. 1854) of Nottingham; two sons and three daughters were born between 1827 and 1840. Both sons were eventually apprenticed to their father, and the two eldest daughters, Charlotte and Elizabeth Eleanor, for many years participated in the design and engraving of the press's ornamental woodblocks. On his uncle's retirement in 1839 Whittingham took over the management of the Chiswick shop, inheriting the successful business outright a year later and adopting its Chiswick Press imprint for his own books. He maintained two shops until 1848, when his London lease expired and he was forced to concentrate the business at the Chiswick premises, which he abandoned in January 1852 after purchasing the freehold of the Tooks Court buildings. In 1847 Whittingham was elected a member of the Society of Arts, and in 1851 served as a member of the jury for the section on paper, stationery, printing, and bookbinding of the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations; he was the co-author, with Ambroise-Firmin Didot, of the jury's official <span class="italic">Report</span> (1852).<br>
<br>Throughout this period Pickering continued to be Whittingham's major client, although from 1845 the publisher was unable to keep current with his payments, and in May 1853 declared bankruptcy. Less than a year later he died, owing Whittingham just under &pound;7500; the printer&#151;whose own wife had died just a few weeks earlier&#151;served as executor and arranged for Pickering's burial in the Whittingham plot at Kensal Green cemetery. Pickering's debts to Whittingham were not cleared until 1859, but by October 1853 Whittingham was already making substantial cash advances to another occasional client, the antiquarian bookseller Henry Stevens &#145;of Vermont&#146; (1819&#150;1886). Stevens's debt, incurred principally through his bookselling activity, reached a high of &pound;6600 in 1859, and was not finally settled until 1881, five years after the printer's death. From 1855 Whittingham also silently took a two-thirds interest in a number of books issued by the publishers Bell and Daldy, possibly viewing the enterprise both as a means of providing work for his skilled personnel and as a way of advertising the special qualities of his printing office and materials.<br>
<br>Whittingham was throughout his career a shrewd businessman, and much of his success must be credited to his ability to combine fiscal good sense with an unusual concern for the quality of the books printed in his shop. In <span class="italic">The Charles Whittinghams: Printers</span> (1896), Arthur Warren described the younger Whittingham as &#145;hot-tempered&#146; as a boy and &#145;brusque and severe&#146; as an adult  (Warren, 96); Warren's drafts, based in part on the recollections of the printer's surviving children, are more explicit, calling Whittingham a &#145;somewhat rough and blunt&#146; man who &#145;showed little or no affection for any one&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 43986, fol. 81). He is said to have softened, personally, after 1860, when he took his manager John Wilkins into partnership and retired from an active role in the press. On Wilkins's death nine years later a new partnership was formed between Whittingham, Wilkins's son John Charles, and Benjamin Franklin Stevens, brother of Henry and husband of Whittingham's daughter Charlotte. In 1872 the Chiswick Press acquired its first steam presses.<br>
<br>On 21 April 1876 Charles Whittingham died at his home in Surbiton, Surrey, and on 27 April was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, London, alongside his friend Pickering. His considerable property was shared among his four surviving children, and following the death of the last the residuary estates, then totalling &pound;63,784, were transferred to the Printers' Pension, Almshouse and Orphan Asylum Corporation. The Chiswick Press itself was purchased in 1880 by the publisher George Bell, and was merged with the firm of William Griggs &amp; Sons, lithographers, in 1919. In 1937 the business resumed the old Chiswick Press name; in 1944 it was purchased by Eyre and Spottiswoode, and in 1962 it was finally closed down.<br>
