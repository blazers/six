<span class="headword">Fowler,  John Beresford</span>  (1906&#150;1977), <span class="occ">interior decorator</span>, was born on 20 June 1906 at the Old Mill House, Lingfield, Surrey, the son of Robert Richard Fowler and his wife, Blanche Beresford, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forster. His father was clerk of the course at the fashionable Edwardian race course at Lingfield. The comfortable circumstances of Fowler's childhood ended in 1915 with his father's early death, and the family moved to the artistic London suburb of Bedford Park and a life of genteel poverty at 12 Woodstock Road (a house designed by Norman Shaw). There was still just enough money for Fowler to be sent to Tormore, a boarding preparatory school, and on to Felsted School, which his elder brother and father had also attended. However, his mother was compelled to remove him in 1923, at the age of sixteen. A series of humble jobs followed and, after a breakdown, he spent a year on a cousin's farm in Kent. He enjoyed this stint, for he was a countryman at heart and deeply knowledgeable about rural ways.<br>
<br>Fowler made the first step towards his later career when he was taken on by Thornton Smiths, a large decorating and antique business in Soho Square. There he was given the task of painting &#145;Chinese&#146; wallpapers, so fashionable at that time; he began with leaves and soon graduated to flowers and birds, for he was a natural draughtsman with a light touch and great technical skill. These papers, having been suitably distressed, were sold as genuinely of the eighteenth century. In Soho Square Fowler also learned and perfected many of the techniques, such as marbleizing and graining, that he later taught to the many craftsmen whom he employed. His next step was to join the decorative painting studio of Margaret Kunzer. She was soon asked to set up a studio for painting furniture and objects to supply the decoration department of Peter Jones (1929). There Fowler gathered around him a small band of talented assistants, and when he decided to set up on his own in 1934 he took them with him, to 292 King's Road, Chelsea&#151;a gimcrack Regency house, part of which he rented. Existence was precarious and funds short; accounts were done on the kitchen draining board and the sewing by somebody's nanny.<br>
<br>Fowler's style of what he famously called &#145;humble elegance&#146; was refreshingly new, and brought a breath of the country to the town. The showroom was on the first floor because the ground floor had another tenant, but a coffin-shaped showcase on wheels was trundled daily into the front garden and its fresh and unusual stock-in-trade caught the beady eyes of two well-known decorators, Mrs Somerset Maugham and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40191/', "Sybil Colefax, Lady Colefax (1874&#150;1950)")</script>, who both lived nearly opposite. Both asked Fowler to join them; he chose Lady Colefax, whom he considered marginally less formidable, and joined her firm in Bruton Street in 1938. Little survives of his pre-war work, and it is hard to discern from black and white photographs why his growing band of fashionable patrons found his work so fresh and exciting.<br>
<br>When war came Fowler, who was hopelessly myopic, was excused call-up. He plunged into dangerous and arduous work as an air raid warden and hospital orderly; meanwhile wartime restrictions meant very little decorating, even on his one day off a week. The first years of peace were still times of privation and rationing, but the most important point in his life came when Mrs Nancy Lancaster acquired the firm, which was by then at 39 Brook Street, premises that had formerly been the office of the Gothic architect Sir Jeffry Wyatville and had been discovered by Fowler in 1944. Mrs Lancaster did not herself decorate professionally but had consummate taste; Kelmarsh, Northamptonshire, and Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, designed by the baroque architect James Gibbs&#151;two houses that she had decorated when married to Ronald Tree MP&#151;were considered pinnacles of pre-war luxury and taste. She used her newly acquired business to buy at cost the wherewithal to furnish Haseley Court, Oxfordshire; more importantly she had exclusive use of the services of John Fowler, who was made a partner in the firm. It was a stormy relationship: her aunt Lady Astor called them the unhappiest unmarried couple in England. Lancaster contributed scale and comfort, and Fowler his incomparable colour sense and eye for detail, to the splendid result. When photographs of Haseley appeared it became the wonder of the age, and the concept of decoration of country houses was changed forever.<br>
<br>In 1947 Fowler bought a miniature Gothic folly: the Hunting Lodge, Odiham, Hampshire. His decoration of it was the acme of simplicity, but not in the least cottagey; it had supreme elegance yet was not over-grand. When photographs of the Hunting Lodge were published it too had enormous influence, as did the remarkable garden that Fowler created around it. He advised on numerous gardens over the years, and so severe were his views on which plants were acceptable that many of his friends dared not plant anything unless it was &#145;Fowler approved&#146;.<br>
<br>In spite of the lengthening queue of people clamouring to be &#145;Fowlerized&#146;, as restrictions were eased the business was chaotically run and, until more businesslike partners were taken on, scarcely prospered. Fowler himself earned a pittance. Apart from potboiling Mayfair flats, which he loathed doing, he worked on at least thirty-five grand country houses and on many lesser ones too. His favourite jobs were perhaps Daylesford, Oxfordshire (for Lord Rothermere), Tyninghame, East Lothian (for Lady Haddington), and Grimsthorpe, Lincolnshire (for Lady Ancaster). The last is open regularly to the public. Fowler called his decorating haute couture but his approach was scholarly and his knowledge of the past profound; he never forgot a detail or a date. As a young man he had haunted museums, especially the Victoria and Albert, which was often open late. In those less scientific days he relied on scrapes and intuition to reveal original colours, and he was a master of the application of paint in an aesthetically pleasing but nevertheless authentic way. Much of this expertise is enshrined in <span class="italic">English Decoration in the 18th Century</span> (1976), which he wrote in collaboration with John Cornforth.<br>
<br>Through friendship with some of its officials Fowler was asked quite early on to advise the National Trust, although some were suspicious of employing a fashionable Mayfair decorator. After he had retired from his firm, in 1975, he worked almost exclusively for the trust for little more than his expenses. An amazing total of thirty houses benefited from his advice. Three stand out, at two of which&#151;Clandon Park, Surrey, and Sudbury Hall, Derbyshire, both almost completely stripped of their original contents&#151;he created a wonderful warm atmosphere. The third, Errdig, in Denbighshire, was an untouched, almost ruined house that was saved from complete dereliction from mine subsidence as a result of Fowler's impassioned letters to the reluctant grandees of the National Trust.<br>
<br>In youth Fowler had been inclined to long hair, sandals, and left-wing politics. In maturity he was distinguished-looking&#151;slim, upright of stature, and beautifully tailored&#151;but the left-wing politics remained. He was a perfectionist and a hard taskmaster, but those whom he castigated knew that he could carry out what they had failed to do far better himself. Almost all who worked for him became devoted friends for life. He was a brilliant teacher and a lavish host (with a superb cook) and inspired much laughter, often laughing himself until he cried. He was a good talker but listened too, and proved a reliable friend for those with troubles. He could be high-handed with clients and dismissed several in mid-job when they proved intractable, but took endless trouble for those whom he liked. He was not interested in money and turned down many of the rich and influential whom he sensed would prove incompatible.<br>
<br>Among official buildings that Fowler worked on are Buckingham Palace, Holyroodhouse, Chequers, Chevening, Christ Church, Oxford, and the Bank of England. He was appointed CBE in 1973. He died, after a long struggle with cancer, on 27 October 1977 at the Hunting Lodge, which he left to the National Trust; his ashes were scattered on the lake there. He never married.<br>
