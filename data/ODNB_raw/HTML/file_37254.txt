<span class="headword">Cadbury,  John</span>  (1801&#150;1889), <span class="occ">cocoa and chocolate manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 August 1801, at 92 Bull Street, Birmingham, into a family of four generations of Quakers, the fifth child and third son in the family of five sons and five daughters of Richard Tapper Cadbury (1768&#150;1860), draper, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Head of Ipswich. He was educated from 1810 to 1815 at Joseph Crosfield's Quaker school at Hartshill.<br>
<br>In 1816 Cadbury was apprenticed to John Cudworth, a Quaker, of the firm Broadhead and Cudworth, Leeds, to learn the retail tea trade. After six years his father sent him to work in the bonded tea house of Sanderson Fox in London, to broaden his experience. In 1824 he was given a sum of money, and was able to set up his own business as a tea dealer and coffee roaster at 93 Bull Street, Birmingham. On 9 March 1826 Cadbury married Priscilla Ann (1799&#150;1828), daughter of John Dymond of Exeter, a draper and Quaker minister. She died two years later. In 1832 he married Candia (1805&#150;1855), eldest daughter of George Barrow, merchant and shipping-fleet owner, of Lancaster. They had five sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Cocoa powder for making an instant drink was first marketed about 1830. John Cadbury saw the potential for the product, and with his experience in roasting beans and preparing nib (crushed cocoa beans) for his shop, decided to open a factory. He purchased a former malthouse at Crooked Lane in 1831, and this is considered the founding date of the Cadbury manufacturing firm. During the first ten years he developed many new lines, and the earliest existing price list (1842) offered sixteen varieties of drinking chocolate and eleven cocoas. In 1846 he took his brother Benjamin (1798&#150;1880) into partnership and changed the name of the firm to Cadbury Brothers, moving it in 1847 to larger premises at Bridge Street. In 1853 Cadbury Brothers were appointed cocoa manufacturers to Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>Convinced that there were practical solutions to the social evils of his day, Cadbury devoted himself particularly to the temperance movement. His campaigns for total abstinence were based on appeals to reason. The abstainer, he pointed out, could afford a good joint of beef on a Sunday. He was appointed to the Birmingham board of commissions in 1829 and in 1851 was chairman of the committee which steered through parliament the bill to transfer the board's powers to the elected council. He also served as an overseer and guardian of the poor (1830&#150;41). He was prominent in the movement to replace &#145;climbing boys&#146; with machines to sweep chimneys.<br>
<br>Cadbury's second wife, Candia, died from tuberculosis in 1855, and later that year Cadbury suffered a severe attack of rheumatic fever. This was a double blow from which he never fully recovered. The business declined seriously and in 1861 Cadbury retired, handing over to two of his sons, Richard and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32232/', "George Cadbury")</script>. He died on 11 May 1889 at his home, 10 Harborne Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, and was buried at Witton cemetery, Birmingham.<br>
