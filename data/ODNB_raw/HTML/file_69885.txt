<span class="headword">Emidy,  Joseph Antonia</span>  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;1835), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born in Guinea, west Africa. Only two sources suggest a date, although neither is definitive. The muster books for the frigate <i>Indefatigable</i> after 1 September 1795 state that he was then twenty-five years old whereas his gravestone records his age at death in April 1835 as sixty; it is probable that, due to his chequered origins, Emidy himself did not know his exact age. The gravestone, which, together with the burial record, are the only records of his second forename, describes him as &#145;a native of Portugal&#146; but James Silk Buckingham, who knew Emidy in the period 1805&#150;7, reports in his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1855) that he had been taken in childhood from Guinea into slavery by Portuguese traders, first to Brazil and subsequently to Lisbon.<br>
<br>By 1795 Emidy was playing second violin in a Lisbon opera house orchestra when he came unwillingly into contact with the British navy. On 10 May 1795 the frigate <i>Indefatigable</i>, captained by Sir Edward Pellew&#151;later Lord Exmouth&#151;put into the Tagus for major repairs. Due to the crowded conditions aboard ship Pellew required a violinist to play for the sailors' recreation and ordered the kidnapping of the young black violinist whom he had noticed playing energetically in the theatre. Josh Emede, described as a volunteer, first appears in the muster taken on 24 June. The <i>Indefatigable</i> sailed on 8 July to resume duties on the western approaches with Emidy, now categorized as a landsman, among the crew. He was to remain aboard, messing alone and in close confinement, until March 1799 when Pellew changed command in his home port of Falmouth.<br>
<br>Cornwall became Emidy's home for the remainder of his life. From a house near the market square in Falmouth he developed a career as a teacher and violinist, appearing as soloist and leader with amateur harmonic societies in many Cornish towns. His professional duties are recorded in newspaper advertisements, reports, and&#151;occasionally&#151;personal memoirs. An anonymous watercolour, dated Truro, 8 November 1808, showing a black violinist leading a group of orchestral musicians, is the only visual record of his career. Emidy married Jane Hutchins (1778&#150;1842), the daughter of a local mariner, on 16 September 1802 at Falmouth parish church. Eight children were born to the couple. In 1815 the family moved to Truro, where they lived at 4 Charles Street, a modest address close to the assembly rooms, theatre, and fashionable town houses where many of Emidy's professional activities were centred. Contemporary accounts speak highly of his ability as a violinist; Buckingham describes him &#145;playing to a degree of perfection never before heard in Cornwall&#146;  (Buckingham, 1.169), and Tuck, remarking that Emidy's fingers &#145;were not much larger than a goose quill&#146;, regarded him as &#145;the most finished musician I ever heard of&#146;; the source of his &#145;great talent &hellip; was always a mystery to me, and to all who came in contact with him&#146;  (Tuck, 19).<br>
<br>That a slave and victim of the press-gang should play an instrument professionally at all is remarkable, but more surprising is Emidy's flair for composition. The earliest reference to this occurs in advertisements for a concert in Falmouth in 1802 which included a violin concerto, composed and performed by Emidy. His compositions were of sufficient quality for Buckingham to attempt in 1807 to interest the impresario Salomon in furthering Emidy's career in London. A selection of orchestral and chamber scores was privately performed, but, although they were well regarded, nothing came of Buckingham's venture. It is impossible to judge any of Emidy's music today as no works were published and no manuscripts have been found. Joseph Emidy died at his home in Truro on 23 April 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of Kenwyn parish church, Truro, on 26 April. Both local newspapers carried brief obituaries, that of the <span class="italic">Royal Cornwall Gazette</span> being the most informative.<br>
