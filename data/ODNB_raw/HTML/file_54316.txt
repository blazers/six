<span class="headword">Ruthven,  William, of that ilk</span>, first Lord Ruthven  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1448, <em>d.</em> 1528), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was the only son and heir of Sir Patrick Ruthven of that ilk and his wife, a daughter of Sir Thomas Cranstoun of that ilk. He had succeeded his father as head of this important east Perthshire family by 12 July 1480, when he resigned his lands of Ruthven to his own son and heir, William. By 1484 the older William's local status had been recognized in his appointment as chamberlain of the royal lordship of Methven and as a conservator of the three-year truce with England. He was also a knight by this date. Loyal to James III in the crises of 1482 and 1488, he was created Lord Ruthven in parliament on 29 January 1488, probably as a royalist counter to the Perthshire rebel Laurence, Lord Oliphant, and to Ruthven's equally disaffected neighbour in west Angus, Andrew, second Lord Gray (<i>d</i>. 1514). In May 1488, after a confrontation at Blackness, James III, who may have passed through Ruthven's lands on his way south from Aberdeen, surrendered Ruthven as one of four hostages to the rebels. Ruthven was ransomed for &pound;1000, a sum for which he was pursued in 1488&#150;9 by Lord Oliphant, who also took Ruthven's sheriffdom of Perth.<br>
<br>But in 1501 Ruthven's heir, William, was sheriff of Perth, a post which Ruthven himself later occupied (after his son died at the battle of Flodden in 1513) and which involved him in much litigation, notably with the burgh of Perth. In favour with both James IV and James V, Ruthven received royal grants of the lands of Strathbraen (1500), Rait (1506), Kynnard (1512), and the barony of Innernity (1528) in Perthshire, and the land of Strathmiglo in Fife (1522).<br>
<br>Ruthven's liaison with Isabel Livingston of Saltcoats (widow of Walter Lindsay of Beaufort), whom he married about July 1480, produced two sons, William and John, who were legitimated in 1480; a daughter, Isabel, was born after their marriage. Following his first wife's death Ruthven married Christian, daughter of William, third Lord Forbes. They had a son, William, the ancestor of the earls of Forth, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who married twice. Ruthven died an octogenarian in 1528. His heir was another William Ruthven, his grandson from his eldest son's second marriage.<br>
