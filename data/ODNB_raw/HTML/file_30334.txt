<span class="headword">Adams, Sir  John</span>  (1857&#150;1934), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Glasgow on 2 July 1857, the third son of Charles Adams, a master blacksmith in the Trongate, Glasgow, and his wife, Barbara McCallum. After attending St David's School he became a pupil teacher at Old Wynd School (later Oatlands School). There he received encouragement from the headmaster, Mr Liddell, and won a queen's scholarship, entering the Glasgow Free Church Training College and the University of Glasgow (1875), where he graduated with a first class in mental and moral science. He taught in the Aberdeen Free Church Training College Demonstration School, 1879&#150;81, returning as a lecturer in 1883. He then became headmaster of the Jean Street School, Port Glasgow, and afterwards rector of Campbeltown grammar school. This experience of school practice formed a sound basis for his subsequent work as a trainer of teachers and a university lecturer in education. In 1890 he was appointed principal of the Free Church Training College, Aberdeen. He married in 1893 Agnes Anne, youngest daughter of John Cook, a shipowner, of Ashley, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>In 1898 Adams became rector of the Free Church Training College, Glasgow. Here his connection with university teaching began, for he then held the lecturership in education in the University of Glasgow. He had already achieved the local distinction of being president (from 1896) of the Educational Institute of Scotland, and had gained wider fame by the publication of a provocative little book, the forbidding title of which, <span class="italic">Herbartian Psychology Applied to Education</span>, belied the sprightliness of its contents.<br>
<br>In 1902 Adams visited Canada and published an account of the protestant schools of the province of Quebec. He was appointed principal of the London Day Training College, and became the first professor of education in the University of London, also in 1902. He was pre-eminently the teacher of London teachers&#151;not only teachers in training, but also teachers at work&#151;for he lectured abundantly in the evenings as well as in the daytime. After he had, in 1922, retired from training-college work and become emeritus professor, he travelled overseas, and by the delivery of series of lectures in the USA, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand he became an international figure in the world of education. He settled in Los Angeles, and lectured at the University of California between 1923 and 1934.<br>
<br>Adams published more than 160 books and articles, the most important of which, in addition to <span class="italic">Herbartian Psychology</span>, are <span class="italic">Exposition and Illustration in Teaching</span> (1909), <span class="italic">The Evolution of Educational Theory</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Student's Guide</span> (1917), and <span class="italic">Everyman's Psychology</span> (1929). All these works, like his lectures, are characterized by an easy style, a shrewd wisdom, and a &#145;pawky&#146; humour. In addition he wrote books for boys under the pseudonym Skelton Kuppord. In 1925 he was knighted for his services to education, and the honorary degree of LLD was conferred upon him by St Andrews University.<br>
<br>As a lecturer Adams was a memorable figure. His impressive bald head, his Scottish accent, his clear, incisive style, and particularly his sly humour, rendered him attractive to audiences all over the English-speaking world. He died suddenly, as the result of a stroke, at Los Angeles on 30 September 1934. He had no children.<br>
