<span class="headword">Inlander,  Heinz Kurt <span class="st"> [Henry]</span></span>  (1925&#150;1983), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 14 January 1925 in Vienna, Austria, the son of Rudolf Inlander (<i>b</i>. 1893) and his wife, Elly. The family, who were Jewish, lived in Trieste from 1935 to 1938, when they moved to London.<br>
<br>Inlander's schooling took place in Vienna, Trieste, and London (1939&#150;41). He became a British subject on 13 December 1947 when he was single and living with his parents at 33 Greencroft Gardens, London. He married twice, the second time to Antonia Josephine O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1982), a painter. He had no children. He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts (1945&#150;9) and the Slade School of Fine Art (1949&#150;52). Here he won first prize in the summer competition with <span class="italic">The Expulsion from Eden (Paradise Lost Book XII)</span> (oil, 1951), the first of several prizes and awards. Most importantly, in 1952 he won the prix de Rome, a scholarship to work at the British School in Rome, where he remained until 1956. He was appointed art adviser to the school in 1955&#150;6 and again in 1971. Inlander spoke Italian and loved Italy sufficiently to buy a house in Anticoli Corrado, in the hills to the east of Rome, which he owned for thirty years and where he and his wife worked for several months every year. It is said that, because of his beard and, perhaps, his penchant for dressing up as a member of the Mafia, he was known locally as Il diabolo  (private information).<br>
<br>Though the countryside around Anticoli Corrado became his preferred subject, Inlander worked and exhibited principally in London. Here he shared a studio complex in the 1960s with the sculptor Bryan Kneale and others &#145;in a rather decrepit workshop belonging to a builders merchant in the Fulham Road&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry Inlander</span>, 1976). Between 1957 and 1979 he taught painting at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts. Students respected Inlander for having moved beyond the tired neo-romanticism prevalent when he began to teach and found him a kindly tutor who helped them to find their own direction. He had many friends, and was admired as &#145;a passionate painter&#146; of great integrity  (private information). His temperament was volatile, shifting rapidly from gloom and self-doubt to high spirits, and he seems always to have questioned his own identity.<br>
<br>Ambitious and focused, Inlander exhibited with the London Group as a non-member between 1947 and 1953. His first solo exhibition was at the Galleria La Tartaruga, Rome, in 1954 and the second at London's Leicester Galleries a year later. Subsequently he showed regularly with Roland, Browse, and Delbanco and the New Art Centre in London and at the Peridot Gallery, New York (1961&#150;3). His paintings were selected for exhibitions organized by the Tate Gallery, the Contemporary Arts Society, and the Arts Council and are in numerous private and public collections in Britain and abroad. In the mid-1970s he held two exhibitions in Vienna. He spent 1960&#150;61 in the United States on a Harkness Commonwealth scholarship and was visiting artist at the University of Calgary in Canada in 1969, though he remained untouched by American abstract expressionism. While he was described by colleagues as a romantic artist, his work, rooted in post-impressionism, was modern but not avant-garde. As a result it has been neglected by critics and historians since his death. His approach is exemplified by <span class="italic">Moving Surface</span> (oil on canvas, 1961; Tate collection). He wrote that it represented &#145;the study of movement in water&#146; where the forms were based on accumulated leaves and branches which constantly shifted in the slow-moving river  (<span class="italic">Tate Gallery: Report</span>, 1962). Even when his work looked abstract, it was grounded in the visible world, though Inlander seldom painted direct from a subject, preferring to work from drawings and memory. Predominantly a landscape painter, he also painted interiors, portraits, many self-portraits, and a variety of animals, for which he evidently had great sympathy. Inlander died at King's College Hospital, London, on 15 December 1983, as the result of a heart attack suffered during a party at Camberwell School of Art, and was buried in a Jewish cemetery in north-west London.<br>
