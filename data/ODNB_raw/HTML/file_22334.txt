<span class="headword">Pitt,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Londonderry  (<em>c.</em>1688&#150;1729), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22333/', "Thomas Pitt (1653&#150;1726)")</script>, governor of Madras, and his wife, Jane Innes (<i>c</i>.1661&#150;1727). He was educated first privately, then from 1704 at Mr Meure's academy, near Soho Square, London, and, in 1707, at Mr Coulson's, Goodman's Fields, where he learned navigation. He became captain of a regiment of dragoons in 1709, served against the rebels in Lancashire in 1715, and was colonel of a cavalry regiment between 1715 and 1726. He represented Wilton in the Commons from August 1713 to July 1727, and was mayor of Wilton in 1716&#150;17.<br>
<br>Pitt married, on 10 March 1717, Lady Frances Ridgeway (<i>d</i>. 1772), the younger daughter and coheir of Robert, fourth and last earl of Londonderry (created 1623), with whom he had three children, two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1719 he was created baron of Londonderry in the kingdom of Ireland, and he took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 8 July 1720. On 8 October 1726 he was further advanced to the dignities of Viscount Gallen-Ridgeway of Queen's county and earl of Londonderry, but he never sat in the Irish House of Lords as an earl. At the general election in August 1727 he was returned to the British House of Commons for Old Sarum, but he vacated his seat on his appointment to the post of governor-general of the Leeward Islands in May 1728, commissioned on 7 June 1727. There is no record of any speech made by him either in the Irish House of Lords or the British House of Commons. He died at St Kitts on 12 September 1729, aged forty-one, and was buried in the family vault in the church of Blandford St Mary, Dorset.<br>
<br>Pitt's great-nephew, Lord Camelford, remembered him as &#145;a man of no character and of parts that were calculated only for the knavery of business, in which he over-reached others, &amp; at last himself&#146;  (Lord Camelford, <span class="italic">Family Characters and Anecdotes</span>, 1781). Camelford's opinion was no doubt shaped by the bitter family legal battles over the settlement of Governor Pitt's estate. Pitt's widow, who inherited the Cudworth estate in Yorkshire, married, in December 1732, Robert Graham, of South Warnborough, Hampshire, and died on 18 May 1772. Pitt's elder son, Thomas (1717&#150;1734), who succeeded as second earl, died from a fall from his horse on 24 August 1734, aged seventeen; his daughter Lucy (1722&#150;1802?) became the wife of Pierce Meyrick, the youngest son of Owen Meyrick of Bodorgan, Anglesey, with whom she had a son, Ridgeway-Owen, and a daughter, Anne; and his younger son, Ridgeway (1722&#150;1765), who succeeded as third earl, died unmarried on 8 January 1765, aged forty-three, when all the honours became extinct.<br>
