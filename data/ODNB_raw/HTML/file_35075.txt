<span class="headword">Montagu, Lord  Robert</span>  (1825&#150;1902), <span class="occ">politician and religious controversialist</span>, born at Melchbourne, Bedfordshire, on 24 January 1825, was the second son of George Montagu, sixth duke of Manchester (1799&#150;1855), and his first wife, Millicent (1798&#150;1848), daughter and heir of Brigadier-General Bernard Sparrow of Brampton Park, Huntingdonshire. Educated privately, he graduated MA from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1849.<br>
<br>In April 1859 Montagu was returned as a Conservative MP for Huntingdonshire and held the seat until February 1874. He quickly made his mark as a speaker, championing church rates and retrenchment. In 1852 he published <span class="italic">Naval Architecture: a Treatise on Ship-Building</span> and advocated the establishment of a naval school of architecture and engineering on the model of the Royal Military Academy. In foreign affairs Montagu was no less active. His <span class="italic">Few Words on Garibaldi</span> (1861) attacked its subject as an adventurer. He opposed Roebuck's resolution (30 June 1863) for recognition of the Confederacy, and he spoke strongly in favour of non-intervention between Denmark and the German powers (5 July 1864). In later years he gave much attention to the Eastern question. On political reform, Montagu showed characteristic individuality. He advocated plural voting, with additional franchises to property and the professions to balance the increase in the numbers enfranchised. On social questions his attitude was more liberal. As early as 1860 he supported a measure for a council of conciliation in labour disputes; and in 1875, in a debate on the <span class="roman">Employers and Workmen Bill</span>, he declared trade unions to be &#145;not only a natural right but a preservative of order&#146;. On his motion (April 1864) a select committee on which he sat inquired into the disposal of sewage in large towns; and subsequent legislation on the subject owed much to his labours. On 19 March 1867 Montagu was made, on the reconstruction of Lord Derby's third ministry, vice-president of the committee of council on education, and was appointed first charity commissioner, being sworn of the privy council. He held office until Disraeli's resignation in December 1868. As education minister Montagu sought vigorously to enforce the conscience clause in all schools that received grants from public funds, and advocated the extension of technical education. But he was an awkward colleague. Lord Stanley observed: &#145;though industrious and quick, his total want of tact makes it impossible that he should be entrusted with the conduct of an important measure&#146;  (Vincent, 327). He carried a bill assimilating the vaccination procedure of England to that of Scotland and Ireland, and took effective measures to deal with a serious cattle plague which had spread from the continent to England.<br>
<br>While in opposition Montagu voted against Irish disestablishment in 1869. But in 1870 he became a Roman Catholic and in 1873 he was formally expelled from the Conservative Party  (Thornley, 200). He became a Conservative home-ruler, sitting for County Westmeath from 1874 to 1880, later claiming that the tories had promised him a cabinet seat if he endorsed home rule  (Thornley, 201). He quickly proved an unreliable member of Isaac Butt's party and by 1877 had left it, but without a reconciliation with the tories, whose Eastern and Indian policy he condemned. <span class="italic">Foreign Policy</span> (1877) was a substantial and quite well-documented attack on the tory government's policy.<br>
<br>On his retirement from parliament in 1880 Montagu devoted himself to religious controversy. In 1864 he had defended church establishments and upheld Anglicanism in <span class="italic">The Four Experiments in Church and State and the Conflicts of Churches</span>; but his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1870 prompted several pamphlets from a different point of view. However, in 1882 he rejoined the Church of England on ethical and political rather than on theological grounds (see his <span class="italic">Reasons for Leaving the Church of Rome</span>, 1886). Thereupon he pursued a vigorous campaign against Romanist doctrine and practice, professing in a series of pamphlets&#151;notably <span class="italic">Scylla or Charybdis, which? Gladstone or Salisbury?</span> (1887)&#151;to expose a conspiracy, in which the leaders of both political parties were involved, to bring England under the dominion of the papacy. <span class="italic">The Sower and the Virgin</span> (1887) was an exhaustive confutation of the doctrines of the immaculate conception and papal infallibility. <span class="italic">The Lambeth Judgment, or, The Marks of Sacerdotalism</span> (1891) minutely analysed Bishop King's case.<br>
<br>Montagu married first, on 12 February 1850, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1857), only child and heiress of John Cromie, of Cromore, co. Antrim, with whom he had two sons and two daughters; second, on 18 October 1862, Elizabeth Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1897), daughter of William Wade, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. Not surprisingly, Montagu's violent switches of political and religious allegiance baffled his colleagues in public life and are still hard to explain. He died at his home, 91 Queen's Gate, London, on 6 May 1902, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
