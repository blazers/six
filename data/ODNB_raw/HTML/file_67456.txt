<span class="headword">Newman,  William</span>  (1577&#150;1640), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was from Staffordshire. He was at Douai in 1594 and was arrested in England in 1601 and condemned to death for his religion, being charged with aiding the escape of a priest from the home of Anne Line. At the intercession of a noble lady at court the death sentence was commuted to banishment and exile. He went to Seville, where he studied and was ordained priest in 1606. In May 1609 he was sent to Lisbon to take charge of the English residence near St Catherine's Church. This was a house for priests which was supported by donations from the duke of Braganza and the archbishop of Lisbon. Among the duties of the rector was that of visiting ships coming from the British Isles, acting as interpreter and seeing that they conformed to the requirements of the Inquisition. This might entail a search for subversive literature and taking note of any protestants who might be thought to be a threat to the security of the state. There was also chaplaincy work on behalf of English sailors.<br>
<br>Newman's predecessor, Nicholas Ashton, had bequeathed property to the residence and Newman wished to use the Ashton legacy to found a seminary for the training of priests for the English mission. He visited Madrid and entered negotiations with Thomas More, the agent for Douai College, in order to further this scheme. It was on one of these visits that he made contact with Pedro Coutinho, a retired Portuguese soldier who was anxious to leave some of his fortune for the founding of a religious house and who had recently been told of the plight of Catholics in England. On learning of this the Jesuits considered that Newman had betrayed his trust since they regarded the opening of seminaries in the Peninsula to be their sole responsibility and he was consequently deprived of his chaplaincy. However, the negotiations went ahead and the papal brief founding the college was issued on 22 September 1622. Although it was Newman who brought together the patronage of Pedro Coutinho and the interests of the English secular clergy he was never president of the college, but he was always concerned with its affairs. His idea that the college should be restricted to students of philosophy and theology did not, however, prevail and from the early days younger boys were also accepted to study the humanities.<br>
<br>Newman became a curate of the Royal Hospital in Lisbon and chaplain at St George's Fort, where he lived much honoured and respected. While ministering at the hospital during an outbreak of sickness he caught a fever and died, on 4 July 1640. He was buried in the college chapel and he left 2000 crowns to the college in his will.<br>
