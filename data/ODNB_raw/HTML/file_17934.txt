<span class="headword">Mangles,  Ross Donnelly</span>  (1801&#150;1877), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and politician</span>, son of James Mangles MP (<i>d</i>. 1838), of Woodbridge, Guildford, and his wife, Mary, youngest daughter of John Hughes of Guildford, was born on 10 September 1801. He was educated at Eton College and at the East India College, Haileybury. He arrived at Calcutta in 1820 and in 1821 was appointed assistant secretary to the board of revenue in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces. Over the next four years he filled a variety of subordinate revenue posts and in July 1825 briefly officiated as secretary to the board of revenue in the Lower Provinces. In August 1825, during the First Anglo-Burmese War, he became secretary to the commissioner of Pegu and Ava. In April 1826 he was appointed deputy secretary in the judicial and territorial departments.<br>
<br>Mangles took furlough from January 1828 until November 1831. On 16 February 1830 he married Harriet, third daughter of George Newcome of Upper Wimpole Street, London, with whom he had at least two daughters and a son. Upon his return to India he again was engaged primarily in revenue work, and was appointed in March 1835 secretary to the Bengal government in the judicial and revenue departments, a post which he held until his retirement from the service in 1839. In mid-1837 the governor-general, Lord Auckland, embarked on a lengthy tour up-country and Mangles, in Auckland's absence, effectively became the chief administrator of Bengal.<br>
<br>In 1839 Mangles returned to London and launched into politics. A life-long whig, he was returned at the general election of 1841 as the member for Guildford, a borough which his father had represented from 1831 to 1837. He retained this seat until 1858. In parliament he established himself as an authority on Indian matters, and in particular blunted the attacks of John Crawfurd of the British India Society who accused the government of India of causing famine and depopulation through its land revenue system. Mangles was a staunch utilitarian and defended the high assessments, then pressing particularly hard on the North-Western Provinces, in the pure terms of the doctrine of rent as expounded by Malthus, Ricardo and James Mill. His article in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of January 1840, &#145;The revenue system of British India&#146;, was explicitly designed to head off a parliamentary assault by tory paternalists on the whig ministry's supposed over-taxation of the Indian peasantry. In July 1840, before the full horror of Auckland's Afghanistan adventure was known, he published a second, more general article in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, &#145;Present state and prospects of British India&#146;, defending Auckland, whom he admired as both a friend and fellow whig.<br>
<br>Mangles was an evangelical Anglican and regarded education and evangelization as mutually supportive pillars of society's moral regeneration. In India he was a member of both the Church Missionary Society and the general committee of public instruction. He believed that India's moral improvement could be effected only through Christianization, and in 1834, unhappy with the slow progress of evangelization, he proposed the establishment of an &eacute;lite seminary in Calcutta to train Indian clergymen for the uphill task ahead. In England, too, he campaigned for a more publicly active church and published in 1840 <span class="italic">Christian Reasons of a Member of the Church of England for being a Reformer</span>. Writing to Macvey Napier, editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, in 1842, he complained that the Anglican laity were denied any meaningful role in the church, an evil compounded in his opinion by the wholesale association of the clergy with the tory party, to the &#145;necessary disgust and alienation of a very large number of their respective flocks&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1847 Mangles became a director of the East India Company and in 1857 was elected chairman. In 1858 he retired from parliament on his appointment to the new Council of India, a position he held until his retirement in 1866. In this venue too, confronted by the cautious paternalism of the post-1857 administration, Mangles vociferously defended the utilitarian vision of the 1830s which had so coloured his years in India. He died in London at his home, 23 Montagu Street, Montagu Square, on 16 August 1877. His son, Ross, received the Victoria Cross for gallant conduct near Arrah during the uprising of 1857.<br>
