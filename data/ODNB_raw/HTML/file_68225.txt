<span class="headword">Gascoigne,  Catherine</span>  (1601&#150;1676), <span class="occ">abbess of Cambrai</span>, was born at Barnbow, west Yorkshire, one of the nine children (four sons and five daughters) of Sir John Gascoigne, first baronet (1557&#150;1637), and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ingleby (<i>d</i>. 1637), of Lawkland, near Settle, Yorkshire. The Gascoignes had been resident in the West Riding of Yorkshire since the late thirteenth century and included among their forebears the early fifteenth-century justice William Gascoigne and the theologian Sir Thomas Gascoigne, who was elected chancellor of Oxford University in 1444. Catherine's mother was a staunch recusant, a position also taken up by her father from about 1604. Four of the couple's children became Benedictines, probably through the influence of the monk Dom Richard Huddleston. Catherine's elder brother John (Dom Placid) was president of the English Benedictine congregation between 1649 and 1653, and the life abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Lamspringe in the bishopric of Hildesheim, Germany, from 1651 to 1681.<br>
<br>Catherine Gascoigne was drawn to a religious life as a young woman, though initially she was firmly discouraged from leaving the country on account of her beauty. In 1623, following a disfiguring attack of smallpox, she travelled to Douai with the intention of joining a strict French community recommended by her brothers. On reaching Douai she accepted an invitation to join eight young English women then <i>en route</i> for Cambrai to establish a monastery directed by English Benedictine monks. On 24 December 1623 Catherine Gascoigne entered Our Lady of Consolation and all nine founders professed on 1 January 1625. Initially the new community began its religious life under the guidance of three experienced nuns seconded from the English Benedictine community in Brussels. However, the Jesuit-inspired spirituality of these older nuns was not congenial to the new community whose members favoured a Benedictine spirituality at odds with the Jesuits' emphasis on the control of personal spirituality. In July 1624 the Benedictine monk Father Augustine Baker was sent to instruct the English community in a more contemplative form of prayer, by which individual nuns were encouraged to follow a form of devotion best suited to their ability and temperament. Initially he was received enthusiastically and his advice was followed, but in time his teachings provoked resistance, with the convent's founder, Dame Gertrude More, leading the opposition. Only Dame Catherine did not waver in her fidelity to Father Baker's teachings and way of prayer. In May 1628 Dame Catherine's younger sister Margaret (1608&#150;1637) entered the convent at Cambrai and professed in June of the following year; another sibling, Christiana, was also destined for Cambrai, but probably died on the journey from England.<br>
<br>In 1629 Dame Catherine was appointed abbess of Cambrai, a position to which she was re-elected every four years until her resignation in 1673. Between 1641 and 1645 she and two other nuns were sent by the archbishop of Cambrai to reform the Benedictine monastery at St Lazare in Cambrai where, serving as temporary superior until 1645, she restored regular discipline. As abbess of Our Lady of Consolation, Dame Catherine was responsible for the spiritual and temporal welfare of the community, duties that proved particularly challenging in such unsettled times. During the 1640s the English civil wars significantly reduced the convent's investments, though it was later admitted that what funds they had received were not well managed by the brethren  (Father Anselm Crowder to Abbess Catherine Gascoigne, 26 Jan 1655, Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 36, no. 19). By 1650 the community numbered as many as fifty nuns and, with circumstances now so straitened, a filiation was made to Paris in 1651&#150;2. Both communities continue in the twenty-first century at Stanbrook Abbey, Wass, north Yorkshire, and St Mary's Abbey, Colwich, Staffordshire, respectively.<br>
<br>The chapter of 1629 that oversaw Dame Catherine's appointment as abbess also invited Father Francis Hull to become the convent's chaplain. This led to conflict as Father Hull accused Father Augustine Baker of anti-authoritarian doctrines and sought to pressure the nuns to obey his rule. On 1 August 1633 the general chapter of the English congregation ordered fathers Hull and Baker to submit accounts of their teachings to them. Dame Catherine and Gertrude More were also asked to provide accounts of their manner of prayer. Dame Catherine began her response:<blockquote>My prayer I know not how to express, but it seems to me to be a longing and vehement desire of the soul thirsting after the presence of God, seeking and intending only and wholly His will and pleasure with as much purity of intention as my imperfection will permit.(Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine, Paris, MS 1202, quoted in Bowden and Lux-Sterritt, 2.463)</blockquote>For Dame Catherine the &#145;exercise of the will taught us by father baker, tends to no other thing &hellip; than this, to bring the soule to a total subjection to God, and to others for God and according to his will&#146; (Downside Abbey, Baker MS 33, fol. 343, quoted in Walker, &#145;Spiritual property&#146;, 241). Her account was approved by the English Benedictine congregation's theologians who encouraged her to: &#145;Goe on couragiously, you have choosen the best way: we beseech Allmighty God to accomplish that union which your hart desireth&#146;  (Benedictines of Stanbrook, 17). The chapter also endorsed Father Baker's writings, but both he and Father Hull were removed from Cambrai. Notwithstanding this judgment, in 1655 Dame Catherine was requested by Father Claude White, president of the English Benedictine congregation, to hand over all of Father Baker's manuscripts to be purged of their &#145;poysonous, pernicious and diabolicall doctrine&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 36, fol. 45, quoted in Van Hyning, 289). Dame Catherine politely refused and stood firm, prompting Father White to accuse her of &#145;in a damnable way running to perdition&#146;  (ibid.). In March 1655 she appealed for support from Father Anselm Crowder, her agent in England, and Father Augustine Conyers. Dame Catherine even considered withdrawing the community from the congregation in order to protect the integrity of Father Baker's writings. That proved unnecessary following Father White's death later that year, though she remained protective of the manuscripts which, in 1676, she described to Father Benedict Stapylton as &#145;the greatest treasures that belongs to this poor community&#146;  (St Mary's Abbey, Colwich, MS 43). Stapylton's recommendation was that &#145;the Ladie Abbesse &hellip; put them into such hands as you shall desire that they may be preserved entire and without alteration&#146; (Archives D&eacute;partmentales du Nord, Lille 20 H10, fol. 505, quoted in Walker &#145;Spiritual property&#146;, 242).<br>
<br>More than forty years earlier Dame Catherine had embraced Baker's contemplative way of prayer, to which she remained faithful throughout her monastic life. She was the dedicatee of Serenus Cressy's edition of Baker's works, <span class="italic">Sancta Sophia</span>, and of a collection of Gertrude More's writings, <span class="italic">The Holy Practices of a Divine Lover</span>, which were both published in 1657. As abbess, Dame Catherine was also an able administrator and adept at marshalling support to defend Baker's teachings. She led by example,<blockquote>tempering the severity of a zealous superior, careful to maintain regularity, with the indulgence of a wise and kind Mother &hellip; She sought no comfort in creatures, nor to be esteemed or loved of them, but she had recourse to God alone. (Benedictines of Stanbrook, 29)</blockquote>Following the Father White episode Cambrai suffered a marked decline in admissions and&#151;with the exception of Dame Catherine's niece Frances (1637&#150;1708), who arrived in July 1655&#151;there were no further candidates until 1660, when entrants began to return. Dame Catherine retired as abbess in 1673 and died on 21 May 1676 at Our Lady of Consolation, Cambrai, where she was buried.<br>
