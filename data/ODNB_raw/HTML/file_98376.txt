<span class="headword">Duffield,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1475&#150;1537/8), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and suffragan bishop</span>, was the last member of the English province of the Franciscan order (which was partitioned between the Observant reform and the Friars Minor Conventual from the middle of the fifteenth century) to be consecrated as a suffragan and to exercise his ministry under the gathering shadow of the dissolution of the mendicant houses. Following his career is complicated by severe problems of identification. In the last few decades of the English province there were three friars of this name who belonged to the custodies of Newcastle, York, and Coventry; two of them became doctors of theology. The first was at Newcastle when ordained deacon in the chapel of the south aisle of the nave of Durham Cathedral on 30 March 1499. He was one of the last members of that community to be ordained before the transfer of the friary to the Observant reform. The second was at York when ordained subdeacon on 18 September 1501 at the city's Greyfriars; he was at Hartlepool when he was ordained to the diaconate on 26 March 1502 in the lady chapel of York Minster. The third was at Worcester when ordained subdeacon on 29 May 1507 at St Mary's collegiate church, Warwick, and at Oxford at the time of his ordination to the diaconate in the chapel of St Mary on the bishop of Salisbury's manor at Ramsbury, Wiltshire, on 18 December 1507. Because the order's constitutions required candidates for ordination to have attained their twenty-fifth birthday, a tentative date of birth for the two northern friars would be about 1475 and a slightly later one for the friar from the midlands.<br>
<br>The loss of the order's archives impedes the quest for fuller information on these three friars. Friars groomed for higher studies cut their theological teeth in the local friaries before being appointed to teach at the custodial schools. It was probably one of the two William Duffields from the custodies of Newcastle and York who took his doctorate in theology at the University of Cambridge in 1521&#150;2, having previously lectured in the custodial schools. But the friar named William Duffield, also a doctor of theology, who on 20 December 1525 was licensed to preach in the diocese of Hereford with an indulgence of forty days for those who heard him, was most likely the one from the custody of Worcester. This friar can be identified with the warden of Shrewsbury who received a gallon of wine from the bailiffs of that town after he had preached to them. Four of the five ordinations recorded above were conducted by suffragan bishops, an office filled by several friars. Thus the prelate who conferred orders on 29 May 1507 was Ralph Haylesdon, a conventual Franciscan who was bishop of Ascalon from 1505 to 1523.<br>
<br>By the later middle ages some English bishops selected their suffragans from the ranks of secular and regular clerics well known to them and trusted by them. While relatively few friars assisted in the diocese of Durham, some from the custody of York were consecrated as suffragans to assist the metropolitan. A friar conducting a ministry in the custody of York, with its houses in Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire, would also have been known to the bishop of Lincoln. John Moorman's view that the bishop hailed from one of the northern custodies is thus persuasive. Although the bishop's donation of his pontifical to the friary at Coventry enters a caveat, it was not in fact unusual for suffragans to move easily across the Humber and to be active in both dioceses. In the end there can be no absolute certainty as to which of these three friars was raised to the episcopate, but it seems very likely that it was a northern William Duffield, a conventual friar with the degree of doctor of theology, who was provided to the diocese of Ascalon by Pope Clement VII on 10 July 1531, on the recommendation of Paolo Emilio Cesi, cardinal-deacon of San Eustachio in Campo Marzio, and authorized to minister in the diocese of St Asaph.<br>
<br>Thereafter Duffield's career as a suffragan bishop can be traced in some detail. Unlike his fellow Cambridge alumnus John Underwood, another Franciscan conventual who was bishop of Chalcedon between 1505 and 1541, and who held a series of benefices in the diocese of Norwich, Duffield was an itinerant suffragan, moving between the dioceses of Canterbury, Lincoln, St Asaph, and York. Henry Standish, a Franciscan who became bishop of St Asaph, licensed him to perform episcopal duties before he moved to the diocese of Lincoln, where nine of his confr&egrave;res had ministered as suffragans between 1322 and 1530. John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, gave him a general commission on 12 November 1531 for the archdeaconries of Lincoln, Leicester, Northampton, Huntingdon, and Bedford. This licence permitted him to bless and dedicate altars, belfries, vestments, and altar vessels; he was also permitted to bless chapels, oratories, and cemeteries. In addition, he was authorized to ordain clerics to all major orders and to bless abbots, abbesses, widows, anchorites, and hermits. His presence in the diocese of Lincoln is attested by his admission to the guild of St Katherine the virgin at Stamford the following year. This may indicate that he was spending some time in the locality, if not the town perhaps at the local Greyfriars. He held ordinations on 30 March 1532 in Lincoln Cathedral, on 21 December 1532 in the prebendal church at Liddington, and on 13 April 1533 in the cathedral again.<br>
<br>On 27 August 1533 Duffield was transferred as suffragan to Canterbury. His stay there seems to have been relatively brief because on 13 July 1535 Edward Lee, archbishop of York, gave him a suffragan commission. On 12 September 1536 he was licensed to consecrate the chapel of St Lawrence in the village of Elstronwick, in the parish of St Peter at Humbleton in Holderness. On 6 February 1536 he was delegated to hold an ordination at Greyfriars, York. In addition, he held ordinations at Whitefriars, York, on 1 April 1536 and at Austin Friars in the same city on 24 February 1537. Despite the fact that one Martin or Maternus was appointed bishop of Ascalon on 19 January 1534, Duffield continued to use that title. His pontifical, printed at Lyons in 1511, was purchased in London shortly after his consecration. The volume (now Harsnett Library, Colchester, H.h.14) was given to the friary at Coventry, a house dissolved in October 1538; this suggests that Duffield had died in 1537 or 1538.<br>
