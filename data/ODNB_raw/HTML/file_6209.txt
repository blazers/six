<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooper,  Anthony Ashley</span>, third earl of Shaftesbury  (1671&#150;1713), <span class="occ">philosopher and author</span>, was born on 26 February 1671, at about eight o'clock in the evening, at Exeter House in the Strand, London, and baptized on 7 March at St Clement Danes. He was the first son of Anthony Ashley Cooper, later second earl of Shaftesbury (1651&#150;1699), landowner, and Lady Dorothy Manners (<i>d</i>. 1698), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17956/', "John Manners, eighth earl of Rutland")</script>. Exeter House was the town residence of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6208/', "Anthony Ashley Cooper (1621&#150;1683)")</script>, who was already an important politician and, elevated as first earl of Shaftesbury in 1672, would dominate the next decade as leader of the whig opposition. By contrast Cooper's father was an ailing, reclusive, and somewhat mysterious figure, known, if at all, for the description of him as &#145;a shapeless Lump&#146; in Dryden's poetic attack on the exclusionists, <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span> (1681). Torn between the active, political model of the first earl and the retiring figure of the second, the third earl found a resolution in writing <span class="italic">Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times</span> (1711), which endorsed both the aspiration to virtuous political action and the ideal of aloof self-knowledge and autonomy.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandadolescence"></a>Childhood and adolescence</h2>The first earl of Shaftesbury, disappointed in his own son, looked to his grandson to assure the family's future. In 1674 the first earl prevailed on his son to relinquish guardianship of the future third earl. John Locke, physician and philosopher, who lived in the Shaftesbury household, had earlier watched over the infant's health and, from 1674, was responsible for his education. In the second half of the 1670s Locke entrusted the boy to Elizabeth Birch, a governess, who, fluent herself in Greek and Latin, laid the foundations for his competence in ancient languages. In the early 1680s he seems to have received instruction directly from Locke, who, in the third earl's later account, governed him according to the principles enunciated in <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on Education</span> (1693).<br>
<br>When the first earl died in exile early in 1683 authority over Cooper, to whom the title Lord Ashley now passed, returned to his parents. They promptly sent him to Winchester College, where he was enrolled from 1683 until no later than early 1686. The tory atmosphere of the school was inhospitable to such a scion of whiggism, and the experience contributed to his lifelong antipathy to formal institutions of education. In 1687 he began a continental tour, guided by a Scottish tutor, Daniel Denoune, and accompanied by Sir John Cropley, who remained an intimate throughout his life, and Thomas Sclater Bacon. After a stop in the Netherlands, where they visited the exiled Locke, and an extended stay in Paris, they spent almost a year in Italy, where Ashley devoted himself to acquiring knowledge and taste in the polite arts. Because of the hostilities between Britain and France that became inevitable once James II had been forced to leave England late in 1688 the party returned to England via central Europe, passing through Vienna, Prague, Dresden, Berlin, and Hamburg. Ashley's notes on his time abroad suggest his well-developed whig sensitivities, since they register suspicion of royal courts, Catholicism, clerics, and especially France. He was abroad in 1688 but commented in a letter to his father that he was thankful for:<blockquote>our late Purges from those promoters of y<sup>t</sup> Interest y<sup>t</sup> was to have Enslav<sup>d</sup> us to y<sup>e</sup> Horridest of all Religions, &amp; to y<sup>e</sup> Service of the Usurpations &amp; treacherys of that Neiboring Crown y<sup>t</sup> has Aim<sup>d</sup> so long att y<sup>e</sup> Subjection of all Europe. (Lord Ashley to the second earl of Shaftesbury, 3 May 1689, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/24/21/229)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Earlystudyandwritings"></a>Early study and writings</h2>Lord Ashley returned to England in the spring of 1689 and resisted the encouragement of at least one prominent whig to stand for the Commons in 1690. Rather he spent the early 1690s mixing serious study with the leisured pursuits typical of a young aristocratic gentleman. This is a poorly documented period compared to the last fifteen years of his life, for which hundreds of letters survive along with notebooks on personal, philosophical, and artistic topics. He inherited many acquaintances and friends from his grandfather and Locke. He knew such Locke associates as Edward Clarke, Walter Yonge, and Damaris Masham. He also established a lifelong friendship with John Somers, to whom he wrote or dedicated many of his mature writings. It was also through Locke that he knew Benjamin Furly, the Quaker merchant and intellectual broker in Rotterdam with whom he corresponded extensively. Furly in turn brought him into contact with continental scholars and men of letters, including Jean Le Clerc, Philip von Limborch, and Pierre Bayle, who introduced him to Pierre Des Maizeaux.<br>
<br>At the same time Ashley associated with Britons of his own generation who shared a principled whiggism that combined aristocratic, classical republican, commonwealth, and country elements into a critique of the whig leadership. His enduring friendship with Robert Molesworth dated from the 1690s. So did his patronage of John Toland, with whom he had an uneasy relationship until in 1703 he concluded that Toland was too unpredictable and irresponsible an ally. His acquaintances also included Charles Davenant, Andrew Fletcher, Walter Moyle, William Stephens, and John Trenchard.<br>
<br>Lord Ashley pursued his reading of history, philosophy, and the classics during the 1690s. His correspondence with Locke from these years broached philosophical topics but also conveyed his quest for a philosophical identity independent of that of his famous mentor. His earliest publications appeared at the end of the decade, enunciating important themes of his later writing. His introduction to a 1698 edition of sermons by the latitudinarian Benjamin Whichcote gave Ashley the opportunity to criticize both the philosophical egoism of Thomas Hobbes and also the egoistic calculation underpinning Christian teachings about future rewards and punishments. In the next year the first version of <span class="italic">An Inquiry Concerning Virtue</span>, on which Ashley had been working since the early 1690s, appeared. It is probably true that, as the fourth earl maintained, John Toland published the <span class="italic">Inquiry</span> without permission, using the manuscript that Ashley had circulated among his friends. However, the fact that a few years later Ashley, by then third earl of Shaftesbury, encouraged Pierre Des Maizeaux to translate this version casts doubt on the fourth earl's story that Toland's piracy so angered Ashley that he tried to buy up extant copies. Besides, the main ideas of the <span class="italic">Inquiry</span> were ones to which the mature Shaftesbury remained committed: that moral norms had an ontological reality independent of religious prescription and that the foundations for human happiness were not in selfishness or pleasure but in virtue itself.<h2>
<a name="PoliticalactivityinthereignsofWilliamIIIandAnne"></a>Political activity in the reigns of William III and Anne</h2>In 1695 Ashley was finally induced to enter politics. He was elected to the seat for Poole, Dorset, in May 1695, when the incumbent, Sir John Trenchard, died. That parliament was dissolved before Ashley could attend but he stood for the seat again, in the elections for the new parliament that autumn, and took his seat on 21 November. The 1695&#150;8 parliament marked a period of taxing activity for Ashley in the Commons. Although he followed &#145;court&#146; leadership on some matters he identified with &#145;country&#146; members and frequently declared his independence of party. He worked to advance legislation associated with the country, most notably raising property qualifications for MPs, protecting the rights of those accused of treason, and disbanding the king's military forces after the signing of the treaty of Ryswick in September 1697. His speech in favour of the <span class="roman">Treason Bill</span>, which provided legal counsel for those accused of treason (a provision from which his own grandfather would have benefited in the 1680s), gave rise to a noteworthy anecdote. According to Abel Boyer, he:<blockquote>rose up in order to speak for it, and having begun his Speech, he industriously feign'd to be so surpriz'd that for a while he could not go on. But having recover'd himself, he took occasion from his very Surprize, to enforce the Necessity of allowing Council to Prisoners, who were to appear before their Judges; since he, who not only was unaccus'd and innocent, but one of their Members, was so dashd when he was to speak before that august Assembly. (Boyer, 3.117)</blockquote>Whether spontaneous or premeditated his remark was regarded as a forceful rhetorical flourish which carried weight in the bill's passage in January 1696.Ashley rather unexpectedly refused to stand again after this parliament was dissolved in 1698 and instead spent a year in the Netherlands. He returned to England in May 1699 and went to the family home, St Giles's House in Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, where his father died on 2 November, at the age of forty-eight. Two months later the third earl of Shaftesbury appeared for the first time in the House of Lords. For the remaining years of William III's reign he attended parliament assiduously. In the debates about the fate of Spain, the growth of French power, the partition treaties, and the impeachment of the whig lords who had negotiated them Shaftesbury found himself identifying more closely than he had with the whig leadership and relinquishing the oppositional posture that he had earlier adopted. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Paradoxes of State</span> (January 1702) argued that the threat of France made obsolete the distinction between court and country and left only one polarity in English politics, between those committed to quashing French ambitions and those not. Shaftesbury worked strenuously on behalf of whig candidates in the west country in the elections for the last two of William's parliaments, with notable success in the election of 1701&#150;2. William recognized Shaftesbury's contributions and may have gone so far as to offer him a ministerial position. However, the political scene was disrupted in March 1702 by William's death. Anne's accession ended Shaftesbury's political prospects; indeed in 1702 she deprived him of the vice-admiralty of Dorset, which his father and grandfather had held before him. Thereafter the political climate, as well as his health, kept Shaftesbury from actively engaging in politics, although he remained a keen observer and at times, such as 1706 when a country amendment to restrict placemen in parliament was attached to the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>, a vigorous adviser.<h2>
<a name="Psychicbiography"></a>Psychic biography</h2>Shaftesbury's fitful political career is primarily interesting as an illustration of the tensions within post-1688 whiggism as its fundamental commitment evolved from radicalism to the defence of a standing regime. None the less his political concerns are important in understanding the writings on which his influence rests. These writings were also significantly inflected by Shaftesbury's psychic history. His decision to abandon parliament and the country in 1698 for a year of study and reflection in Rotterdam was symptomatic not just of fatigue and poor physical health but of psychological stress, for which there is remarkable evidence in the notebooks that he began keeping at this time.<br>
<br>These notebooks were in part a commonplace book, assembling extracts from the Roman stoics Marcus Aurelius and especially Epictetus, and in part a diary of personal rumination and discovery. The notebooks show him struggling for personal autonomy and control in a social world that ineluctably pulled him in diverse directions and often compromised his integrity. His conflicts reflected the tension between, on one side, the social and political expectations imposed on him by his inherited social position and the model of his grandfather and, on the other, his individual temperament, which, borrowing from his father, was oriented toward privacy, contemplation, and study. Shaftesbury wrote extensively in these notebooks during 1698 and 1699, and again in 1703 and 1704, when he resumed residence in Rotterdam at a distance from his social and political obligations.<br>
<br>Though Shaftesbury endured periodic anxieties until the end of his life he appears to have reached a certain degree of psychological resolution during the first decade of the eighteenth century. He reaffirmed his commitment to a political vocation but recognized that he would fulfil it as a writer of whiggishly disposed works. He also affirmed his identity as a philosopher, but one whose ideas and methods were quite distinct from those of Locke.<h2>
<a name="AssemblingCharacteristicks"></a>Assembling Characteristicks</h2>From the early 1700s Shaftesbury was experimenting with genres and subjects situated on the borders of the topical, the political, and the philosophical. However, it was in the second half of the decade that he began publishing pieces, in different genres and of successively increasing length and complexity, that became the components of his chief work, the <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>.<br>
<br>The first of these was prompted by the appearance in London in 1706 of the so-called &#145;French prophets&#146;, refugees from the remote C&eacute;vennes region of the Massif Central, where a millennially inspired protestant revolt against Catholic and royal authority had broken out in 1702. By 1707 the refugees had several English followers and apologists, whose prophetic activities Shaftesbury witnessed that summer. He drafted <span class="italic">A Letter Concerning Enthusiasm</span> in the autumn, although it was not published until spring 1708. While the <span class="italic">Letter</span> did ridicule the extravagancies of enthusiasts it also offered a positive interpretation of enthusiasm conceived as the morally orienting affective and imaginative capacity of individuals.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Letter</span> provoked a number of responses, including pamphlets by Mary Astell and Edward Fowler, bishop of Gloucester. These responses stimulated Shaftesbury to write <span class="italic">Sensus communis: an Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour</span>, published in 1709. <span class="italic">Sensus communis</span> defended and elaborated the earlier work by articulating an ideal of free and open public discourse as a programme for human progress and refinement. Shaftesbury grounded this programme on the human potential for solidarity and co-operation, itself founded in natural human sociability. In the same year he published <span class="italic">The Moralists: a Philosophical Rhapsody</span>. Organized as a tale of philosophical conversion this dialogue pitted a sceptic against a theist in a discussion vindicating a highly stoic vision of cosmic, social, and human order under the presidence of a supreme intelligence.<br>
<br>Finally, in 1710, Shaftesbury published <span class="italic">Soliloquy, or, Advice to an Author</span>, in which he treated the importance of arts and letters in society and the conditions in which they thrive. While apparently remote from his strictly ethical concerns the <span class="italic">Soliloquy</span> formulated publicly the sort of self-discursive technique for attaining self-knowledge that Shaftesbury had already explored in his notebooks. Thus the <span class="italic">Soliloquy</span> was indirectly related to many of Shaftesbury's chief philosophical concerns.<br>
<br>It is not clear exactly when Shaftesbury decided to bring together these four publications and the earlier <span class="italic">Inquiry</span>. By 1710 he was revising all of them, some significantly. In addition he wrote a set of five miscellanies to accompany and comment on the earlier writings. The result was the first edition of <span class="italic">Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times</span>, published by John Darby in three volumes in 1711. Over the next two years Shaftesbury polished <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>, making many revisions, largely stylistic, in the text. He also commissioned a set of engravings to adorn the new edition and illustrate emblematically the philosophical and political meanings of the text. These were based on drawings which Shaftesbury had commissioned from Henry Trench, an Irish artist based in Rome, and had carried out in London by the distinguished Huguenot engraver Simon Gribelin. These fine graphics, in addition to greater care in the layout and typography, made the second edition of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> (1714) a splendid piece of book art.<h2>
<a name="InterpretingCharacteristicks"></a>Interpreting Characteristicks</h2>
<span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> was a complex as well as composite book, a work of philosophy in a polite mode. It aimed centrally to convey a notion of philosophy as a form of ethical training. It mocked scholasticism, which survived, moribund but not quite dead, in the universities. More importantly it criticized those philosophical &#145;innovators&#146;, namely Ren&eacute; Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke, who themselves sought to demolish scholasticism. If they took their inspiration from mathematics and natural philosophy Shaftesbury took his from social and aesthetic experience. If they helped to make epistemology the central task of philosophy, Shaftesbury insisted on philosophy's ethical core. Assigning him paternity for the idea of moral sense, as philosophers have often done, has tended to assimilate him inaccurately to the epistemology-centred project of philosophy that he rejected. He opposed two traits of modern philosophy in particular: first, philosophical egoism, the postulate that the solitary individual was the starting point for social and ethical thinking; and, second, nominalism, the notion that ethical and other standards were largely conventional in character. In addition he found modern philosophy too dry, abstract, and demonstrative to address the moral formation of gentlemen.<br>
<br>Characterizing modern philosophy as revived epicureanism Shaftesbury aligned his own project with stoicism. He believed humans to be situated in a morally orderly cosmos and, by virtue of their natural sociability, capable of ethical virtue and political solidarity. These commitments were shaped by extensive readings in classical philosophy, where he found Socrates and Xenophon (rather than Plato), Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, the most potent models. He also absorbed modern influences, especially those of moderate English churchmen such as Jeremy Taylor, Henry More, Richard Cumberland, and Benjamin Whichcote. Since his outlook depended on an orderly cosmos in which an intricate pattern of interdependence supported an ethics of reciprocity, he was highly theistic in his outlook. He did defend freethinking and scepticism as forms of intellectual practice, but he was wary of some kinds of deism. In particular he rejected any hint of materialism or nihilism, which he regarded as conducive to atheism.<br>
<br>As far as received religious opinion was concerned Shaftesbury was deeply sceptical of many claims made on behalf of the traditional Christian God and especially critical of ecclesiastical institutions. His moral thought aimed to secure the ontological reality of an ethical standard, not only against nominalism but against the position&#151;closely related to nominalism, in his view&#151;that ethics had to be founded in revealed religion. He was particularly anxious to show the inadequacy of the doctrine of future rewards and punishments as the ground for human ethical behaviour, since it founded supposedly moral behaviour on an essentially egoistic calculation of future benefit.<br>
<br>In addition, like anti-clerical writers from James Harrington onwards, Shaftesbury identified priestcraft as a malevolent force in the world, propagating superstition and spiritual subjection to the acquisitive worldliness of priests. He traced the deleterious impacts of priestcraft through world history and assigned high-church Anglicans a pedigree extending back through the Catholic church to classical Rome and even ancient Egypt. Bedevilled by priestcraft, human spiritual history was also marred by enthusiasm. Adapting the critique of enthusiasm, initially used against puritans and others who, it was said, relied too heavily on the spirit to make religious or philosophical claims, Shaftesbury carried it in new directions by suggesting that the high-church clergy were enthusiasts whose delusions authorized fanatic persecution. At the same time he wished to recuperate enthusiasm as that capacity, first limned by Plato, of being genuinely inspired by the divine and, for Shaftesbury, of being moved and drawn to the moral and aesthetic imperatives laced into the very structure of the universe by the supreme intelligence.<br>
<br>For Shaftesbury, avoiding the poles of superstition and enthusiasm was requisite for a correct philosophical temper. However, his criticism of spiritual perversion also had a political valence. Both superstition and persecuting enthusiasm helped to explain high-church bigotry, which he identified with toryism. He desired a moderate, inclusive, and tolerant religious establishment, controlled by the magistrate. Shaftesbury conspicuously cited such Anglican writers as Jeremy Taylor and John Tillotson, whom he deemed friendly to his own ecclesiology, and, according to the fourth earl, he actually attended Church of England services when his health permitted  (fourth earl of Shaftesbury, sketch of the life of the third earl, Shaftesbury papers, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/24/21/226, p. 8).<br>
<br>This ecclesiastical position was one important element in Shaftesbury's vision of the whig polity that the 1688 revolution had made possible. The other was a patriotic whig libertarianism defined against a toryism that he linked with Stuart and French absolutism. Though deeply concerned with politics, his writings did not use the intellectual equipment that have made the writings of Hobbes and Locke canonical among students of the history of political discourse. In fact he was dismissive of the natural law tradition and its trappings (the state of nature, natural law, contract), and his references to republicanism and British constitutionalism tended to brevity.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury's main approach to politics was ethical and cultural; he promoted liberty by offering an account of liberty's culture. The heart of this culture was free and open discussion in a public arena. He found a model for such discussion in polite conversation, that is, edifying though pleasant interaction among free and equal gentlemen. Within the &eacute;litist terms of a gentlemanly society his version of polite conversation endorsed equality, reciprocity, and scepticism. When he asserted that all politeness was founded in liberty, he extended the reach of polite conversation to a generalization about culture as a whole. Thus he was critical of authoritarianism, whether ecclesiastical or governmental, and any dogmatic claims to certainty that had not been adequately tested. Throughout <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> Shaftesbury used cultural history to explore the intertwined histories of politics and culture and to show how repeatedly in history priestly and royal regimes proved the enemy, and liberty the foundation, of the advancement of arts and letters.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury elaborated these ideas with persuasive force but without demonstrative rigour throughout the components of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>. The work's composite organization and discursive style explain why historians of both philosophy and political discourse have tended to neglect it. While <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> was a collection its composite and digressive character was also a matter of design. The miscellanies, written specifically for the collection, were the most digressive of all the components and declared the cognitive value of the lack of system. This lack supported the philosophical, political, and cultural goals of the work by providing a textual embodiment of diversity, open-endedness, and freedom. Thus <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> was meant not just to advertise a cultural model but also to actualize its parameters for the sake of its readership's moral and cultural edification.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>By the time <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> appeared in the spring of 1711 Shaftesbury had already set in motion plans to exit the English scene. He had long deferred marriage, having enunciated repeatedly a strong desire to remain single; he preferred, it seems, to imitate Theocles, the philosophical hero of <span class="italic">The Moralists</span>, who lived a sober country life, devoted to study and enthusiastic contemplation, punctuated only by the visits and high-minded conversation of select gentlemen. Shaftesbury's sexual orientation has been a matter of some speculation; aside from his undoubted homosocial propensities, one of his letters, recounting an infatuation with a young man, suggests homosexual longings and attachments  (Shaftesbury to Maurice Ashley, his brother, written 22 Jan 1705, posted 24 Dec 1705 [<i>sic</i>], TNA: PRO, PRO 30/24/20/110). However, he also recognized the obligation imposed by his social station to continue his line. With the assistance of Robert Molesworth in 1708 and 1709 he tried to negotiate an alliance with Lady Anne Vaughan, the daughter of John Vaughan, third earl of Carbery. When that effort failed, he settled quickly on a bride of less conspicuous wealth and status, Jane Ewer (1689?&#150;1751), daughter of Thomas Ewer, squire of Bushy Hall in Hertfordshire. The marriage took place on 29 August 1709 and, on 9 February 1711, achieved its chief objective when the countess gave birth to a son, Anthony Ashley Cooper, who survived to become the fourth earl and assure the line.<br>
<br>By then, however, Shaftesbury's health was seriously deteriorating and he was about to make a final retreat. At several points during his life doctors diagnosed the particular weakness of his lungs and his tendency to asthma; his papers contain many prescriptions to relieve a variety of ills. These respiratory difficulties had long affected his living arrangements, particularly when he was not staying at St Giles's. In the 1690s, when he was in London, he occupied a residence near Red Lion Square. However, after he assumed his title and his health began to weaken he bought a house in Little Chelsea on what is now the Fulham Road; to the west of London, this site offered relief from London smoke. In 1709 he rid himself of the Chelsea house in favour of one in Reigate, Surrey, which offered greater distance from London air. However by the time that the first edition of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> was nearing publication he decided he would have to seek an entirely new and more salubrious climate if he was to survive. Giving up the house in Reigate he took one in Kensington, where he lodged his son and, for himself, made arrangements to go to Italy.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury sailed from Dover with the countess and a small retinue on 2 July 1711. Their route took them through Paris, Dijon, Lyons, Grenoble, Turin, Florence, and Rome to Naples, where they arrived on 15 November 1711 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. They promptly set up a household in a <i>palazzo</i> in Chiaia, overlooking the Bay of Naples. After recovering from the damage to his health by the long journey Shaftesbury engaged in visiting sites in and around Naples and in socializing with local aristocrats and virtuosi. As noted above, he put considerable effort into preparing the second edition of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>.<br>
<br>In Italy, Shaftesbury also turned his attention more intently on the visual arts. He collected prints and paintings and he issued a major commission to Paolo de Mattheis (1662&#150;1728), a prominent Neapolitan painter influenced by Luca Giordano and Carlo Maratta. The result was <span class="italic">The Judgment of Hercules</span>, a huge canvas which hung in St Giles's House until sold in 1980 to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. However, the image was well known in the eighteenth century as engraved by Simon Gribelin in 1714. Shaftesbury's commission included elaborate instructions about the nature and meaning of the scene to be represented. These were first published in French in the learned <span class="italic">Journal des S&ccedil;avans</span> in 1712 and then, in English, in 1713 as <span class="italic">A Notion of the Historical Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of Hercules</span>. (The <span class="italic">Notion</span> also appeared in volume 3 of the second edition of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>.) Shaftesbury also wrote <span class="italic">A Letter Concerning the Art, or Science of Design</span> (included in some copies of the second edition of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> and in all copies from the fifth edition in 1732), in which he described the promise of British culture under post-1688 conditions. He had a larger project in hand, namely, <span class="italic">Second Characters</span>, a companion to <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>, which would have included both the <span class="italic">Notion</span> and the <span class="italic">Letter</span>, along with a commentary on <span class="italic">The Picture of Cebes</span>, a Socratic dialogue about painting (dating from the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>) and a long new treatment of the arts, notes for which he left in manuscript.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury's health declined toward the end of 1712 and he died in Chiaia on 15 February 1713 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. His remains were returned to England and he was buried in the church at Wimborne St Giles; the granite monument there represents a sarcophagus, over which stands a female figure of &#145;Polite Literature mourning the death of her most distinguished votary&#146;. At his death his landed estate had a rent roll of some &pound;4000 a year; the inventories of his possessions, taken at his death, were &pound;2003 for St Giles's House (excluding paintings, other art works, and the library) and &pound;284 for the house at Kensington. He left little debt, largely because he fretted much about expenses after he inherited his title and sought to live within his means. Yet his papers also record regular benevolence to the needy in the St Giles's neighbourhood, and he extended considerable patronage to a number of young men, including Michael Ainsworth, Pierre Coste, Paul Crell, and Joseph and Thomas Micklethwayte.<h2>
<a name="Shaftesburysinfluence"></a>Shaftesbury's influence</h2>Shaftesbury's writings attracted a number of trenchant critiques in the eighteenth century, most notably those of Bernard Mandeville, George Berkeley, Joseph Butler, and William Warburton and his circle, including John Brown. Shaftesbury was charged with underestimating the power of human selfishness, failing to provide an adequate criterion of virtue, mistaking his aristocratic tastes for an ethical programme, overestimating ridicule as a test of truth, undermining order through his anticlericalism, and proffering a deistic hostility to revelation.<br>
<br>However, such critiques also suggested the extent to which a Shaftesburian moral and aesthetic tenor shaped the age's intellectual and cultural climate. Before 1800 <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> went through twelve English-language editions, and selections of his letters were published six times. Shaftesburian ideas and themes appeared frequently in periodicals and poetry, most notably that of Alexander Pope, James Thomson, and Mark Akenside. In the gentlemanly class Shaftesbury found enthusiastic readers, such as the soldier and statesman James Stanhope, who was the first in a line of Shaftesburians inspired by the pursuit of virtue and taste. Seeking to integrate ethics and aesthetics into the education of the gentleman Shaftesbury belonged to a European lineage of courtesy writers stretching back to Baldassare Castiglione. The broad reach of Shaftesbury's writings influenced taste in painting, architecture, and gardens, deep into the century.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury's writing also contributed to the shape of contemporary philosophical and social thinking. His enquiries concerning virtue and religion, liberty and order, private autonomy and social cohesion, taste and beauty, were a starting point for writers throughout Britain. His most influential interpreter was Francis Hutcheson, who, settling in Dublin in the 1720s, was befriended by Robert Molesworth and exposed to Shaftesbury's writing. In his publications of the 1720s Hutcheson converted Shaftesbury's insights into a more formal approach to ethics and aesthetics, which he imported to Scotland when appointed professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow University in 1730. Either directly or as mediated by Hutcheson, Shaftesbury inspired William Wishart, George Turnbull, David Fordyce, and James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, among other Scots. While Hutcheson and others responded to Shaftesbury's specifically ethical positions Shaftesbury's more general concern with the nature and growth of politeness shaped the Scottish Enlightenment's attempt to define the norms and operations of a modern commercial and civil society. In England, meanwhile, although defended by Richard Fiddes, Henry Coventry, and Charles Bulkley and echoed by Viscount Bolingbroke, Shaftesbury found his greatest continuator in his nephew James Harris, in whose career scholarship, cultivation, and civic and political activism combined to promote a progressive whiggish culture. Shaftesbury was also eagerly absorbed by a range of North Americans, from Jonathan Edwards and the American Samuel Johnson to Thomas Jefferson and Ezra Stiles.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury's highly wrought prose style had always been susceptible to criticism and even ridicule, as commentaries by Berkeley, Adam Smith, George Campbell, and Hugh Blair make clear. However in the second half of the eighteenth century such criticisms betokened a decline of Shaftesbury's persuasiveness in general. The highly sympathetic article on Shaftesbury in the <span class="italic">General Dictionary, Historical and Critical</span> (1739), signed by Thomas Birch, although largely written by James Harris in co-operation with the fourth earl of Shaftesbury, proclaimed that the essays in <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span>:<blockquote>are not only perfectly finished in themselves, according to the nature and genius of that species of writing to which each belongs, but &hellip; all together they form a complete whole, whose parts have a certain order and relation to each other, and which cannot be inverted without the whole's being injured. (Birch, 183)</blockquote>However Andrew Kippis, in the second edition of the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> of 1789 (which expanded on the <span class="italic">General Dictionary</span>), provides evidence of Shaftesbury's declining stature:<blockquote>For a considerable time he stood in high reputation as a polite writer, and was regarded by many as a standard of elegant composition. His imitators, as well as admirers, were numerous, and he was esteemed the Head of the School of sentimental Philosophy. Of late years, he has been as much depreciated as he was heretofore applauded. (Kippis, 290)</blockquote>On the continent Shaftesbury's influence arrived later and lasted longer than in Britain. He became known initially through learned journals, then through the mediation of such writers as Pope and Bolingbroke, and finally through translations of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> itself. Denis Diderot was deeply impressed by Shaftesbury, translating the <span class="italic">Inquiry Concerning Virtue</span> (1745) and then plundering the rest of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> for his <span class="italic">Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</span> (1746). In the <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die</span> Diderot juxtaposed Lockean penetration and truthfulness with Shaftesburian genius. Similarly Montesquieu ranked Shaftesbury, with Plato, Montaigne, and Malebranche, as one of the four great poets. It was no doubt this poetic quality that caught the imagination of Shaftesbury's German readers, who included Justus M&ouml;ser, Johann Gottfried von Herder, and Moses Mendelssohn, who modelled his own philosophical dialogue on <span class="italic">The Moralists</span>. Similarly Gotthold Lessing's <span class="italic">Laokoon</span> (1766) took off from Shaftesburian aesthetic premises.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury provided a model for polite gentlemen in his own connoisseurship, which was sparing but highly deliberate. He was intimately involved in designing the two important portraits of him, which conveyed characteristic messages. Both were painted by John Closterman at St Giles's House, in 1700 and 1701. A full-length double portrait of Shaftesbury and his brother Maurice Ashley as philosophers in antique garb affirmed the unity of nature and culture, virtue and taste. Meanwhile a full-length portrait of Shaftesbury, with a servant beckoning from behind a curtain in the background, endorsed the equal claims of action and contemplation, politics and philosophy.<br>
