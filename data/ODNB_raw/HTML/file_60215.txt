<span class="headword">Marshall,  (Claude Cunningham) Bruce</span>  (1899&#150;1987), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 24 June 1899 at 8 East Fettes Avenue, Edinburgh, the son of Claude Niven Marshall, a stockbroker, and his wife, Annie Margaret Seton Bruce. After schooling at Edinburgh Academy (1906&#150;9) and at Trinity College, Glenalmond (1909&#150;15), he read classics at the University of St Andrews in 1916&#150;17, but his studies were interrupted by the First World War, in which he served from 1917 with the Royal Irish Fusiliers. Shortly before the armistice he was wounded and taken prisoner, subsequently losing a leg because of poor treatment.<br>
<br>In 1919 Marshall published the first of more than forty books: his only collection of short stories. He did not return to St Andrews, but in 1922 took up his studies again at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MA in 1924, the year in which he published the first of what he himself described as nine very bad religious novels, inspired by his conversion to Roman Catholicism. In 1925 he graduated BCom at Edinburgh and the following year, after qualifying as a chartered accountant, joined the Paris branch of Peat Marwick Mitchell. In Paris, on 31 October 1928, Marshall married Mary Pearson Clark (1908&#150;1987), known as Phyllis, daughter of William Glen Clark, a schoolmaster. Their only child, Sheila Elizabeth Bruce Marshall (later Ferrar), was born on 19 March 1931. In that year he also produced the first of his novels to be widely noticed (although more so in the United States than in Britain), and the first the older writer wished to acknowledge: this was his tenth novel, <span class="italic">Father Malachy's Miracle</span>, a humorous clerical fantasy set in Edinburgh. Revised in 1947, it was a bestseller in Italy and Germany in 1949 and 1950, and in Britain, as a children's book, survived the author's death.<br>
<br>In the years leading up to and including the Second World War Marshall's stream of novels kept flowing, and he continued his accountancy work until June 1940, when, two days before the Germans entered the French capital, he returned to Britain. He served in the Royal Army Pay Corps before joining intelligence, where he was valued for his perfect French and knowledge of France. From 1945 to 1946 he was in Rome and then Vienna, working with displaced persons; these experiences of international bureaucracy inspired <span class="italic">The Red Danube</span> (1947), later filmed, and <span class="italic">A Girl from L&uuml;beck</span> (1962).<br>
<br>After Marshall was demobilized in 1946 he and his wife returned to Paris, then in 1948, when he retired from accountancy to devote himself to writing, moved to the south of France, where he found the climate kinder to his war wound. Here he wrote the book by which he was best-known; ironically, it was not a novel. <span class="italic">The White Rabbit</span> (1952), the harrowing story of the capture and torture by the Gestapo of the resistance hero Wing Commander F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, was a book that Marshall, who also served in the Special Operations Executive, of which his hero was an agent, was ideally qualified to write. It was acclaimed for its graphic power, and successfully dramatized on television.<br>
<br>As Marshall's own experiences helped with the biography of Yeo-Thomas, likewise his life invariably fed into his novels. Examples, apart from those already cited, are not hard to find, and too numerous to list exhaustively. His own schooldays informed <span class="italic">George Brown's Schooldays</span> (1946), trenchant on savagery and homosexuality in public schools. His knowledge of accountancy enabled him to write <span class="italic">The Bank Audit</span> (1958), perhaps the most technical of financial novels. Memories of St Andrews lent colour to <span class="italic">A Thread of Scarlet</span> (1959), a novel about priestly ambition that showed that the convert could still criticize the church he loved. That church's attitude towards birth control and celibacy was tackled in <span class="italic">The Bishop</span> (1970), a novel Marshall thought one of his best, and best-written. However, he suffered by the inevitable comparison with two other novelists who were converts to Roman Catholicism, Evelyn Waugh and&#151;especially&#151;Graham Greene. Marshall's achievement is altogether lighter, and slighter; but it is equally distinctive and wide-ranging, and in his accessible and enjoyable farces he comes across to readers as more warmly humorous than either of his greater contemporaries.<br>
<br>In the south of France the Marshalls lived first at Juan-les-Pins and then went to the Cap d'Antibes; they spent the last thirty-four years of their lives at Clos Riant, 104 boulevard du Cap, shared with up to ten cats. The writer had many good friends, who regarded him with great affection, and many visited him in France and were welcome, though unexpected invasions of his privacy by acquaintances making Antibes a stepping-stone on their holiday journeys could elicit unfavourable comment from the very forthright Scot. He was also notably cheerful, which may be partly why he got on especially well with children, enjoying long conversations with them. He was particularly delighted that his granddaughter followed him in becoming a chartered accountant with his old firm, now called KPMG, in which he accurately predicted she would become a partner, though he did not live to see this. Marshall died in hospital in Biot on 18 June 1987, a month after being operated on for cancer. After his funeral in Biot, his ashes were scattered in the garden of the crematorium at Nice. His widow survived him by only two months.<br>
