<span class="headword">Stewart <span class="st"> [Steuart]</span>, Sir  James, of Goodtrees</span>  (1635&#150;1713), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was born on 23 August 1635, probably in Edinburgh, possibly in North Berwick, the fourth of seven children of Sir James Stewart of Kirkfield and Coltness (1608&#150;1681) and his first wife, Anna Hope (<i>d</i>. 1646), niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13736/', "Sir Thomas Hope (d. 1646)")</script>, lord advocate. His father, a staunch covenanter and successful Edinburgh banker and merchant, was elected lord provost of Edinburgh first in 1648 and again in 1649, 1658, and 1659, and was commissary-general and treasurer of the excise under the covenanter regime. Dismissed and charged (probably falsely) for embezzlement after the Restoration, Kirkfield was imprisoned twice, gaining his final release in 1670 and remission in 1671.<br>
<br>A devout covenanter, the younger James Stewart matriculated at Leiden University in 1657, studying law, and received an MA from Glasgow in 1659. He was called to the bar in November 1661. His first major case was in defence of his father, which brought him royal opposition. In 1667, with the covenanting minister James Stirling, he anonymously published <span class="italic">Naphtali, or, The Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland</span>, a review of persecution of Presbyterians since the Restoration and a religious and legal defence of the Pentland rising (November&#150;December 1666), to which Stewart was a remote accessory; Stewart wrote the legal parts of the book. Bishop Andrew Honyman of Orkney (1619&#150;1676) having published a rebuttal, <span class="italic">A Survey of &hellip; Naphtali</span> (1668), Stewart replied anonymously with his most important political treatise, <span class="italic">Jus populi vindicatum, or, The people's right to defend themselves and their covenanted religion, vindicated</span> (1669), in which, building on Samuel Rutherford's (1600&#150;1661) <span class="italic">Lex, rex</span> (1644), John Brown of Wamphray's (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;1679) <span class="italic">Apologetical Relation</span> (1665), Johannes Althusius's (1557&#150;1638) <span class="italic">Politica methodice digesta</span> (1603), and George Buchanan's (1506&#150;1582) <span class="italic">De jure regni apud Scotos</span> (1579), he combined biblical, natural law, and contractual arguments in support of a private right to violent resistance to tyrannous rulers. His part in these writings was soon suspected by the government, and in 1671 Stewart went into exile in Rouen as a merchant under the alias Graham. He returned to Scotland after about two years, where, in response to corruptions in government, he anonymously published an <span class="italic">Accompt of Scotland's Grievances by Reason of the d. of Lauderdale's Ministrie</span> (1674). Thirteen months later Charles II ordered the privy council to apprehend him on charges of treason and seditious libel. He escaped arrest and became an exile under the alias Lawson in England, where for the next several years he wrote religious homilies and discourses on political theory, none apparently now extant. He practised law anonymously, preparing legal briefs for clients who met only his clerk. He became increasingly involved with English and Scottish radicals in both Britain and the Netherlands. About 1677 or 1678 he married Agnes Trail, daughter of the covenanting minister Robert Trail, whose son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27659/', "Robert Trail")</script> preached at conventicles. In 1679 the king withdrew his order for Stewart's arrest, and he returned to Scotland.<br>
<br>Late in 1681 a memorandum by Stewart critical of the government was found among the papers of Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll, who had been charged with treason for taking the oath required by the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1681 with reservations in favour of protestantism, apparently on Stewart's advice. (It was for this that Argyll was executed after his rebellion in 1685, no new indictment for the rebellion being made.) Indicted for treason in January 1682, Stewart fled to Utrecht, in the Netherlands, where he joined Scottish and English exiles in plotting to overthrow the Stuart monarchy. There, over the next few years, he had a minor hand in the larger insurrection plot associated with the Rye House plot and the English &#145;council of six&#146; (1682&#150;3), led by Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, although probably not in the narrower assassination plot. After these plots failed, Stewart joined surviving radicals in the Netherlands plotting and raising funds for the rebellions to be led by Charles II's illegitimate son James Scott, duke of Monmouth (1649&#150;1685), whom Stewart advised to style himself king in direct challenge to James's succession because of the latter's Catholicism, and Argyll, writing the <span class="italic">Declaration and Apology</span> justifying the latter's invasion, although when the time came Stewart rightly advised that the movement lacked adequate support in Scotland and declined to join in the invasion (May 1685). He was indicted and condemned <i>in absentia</i> for treason.<br>
<br>Stewart remained in the Netherlands, working closely with William Carstares, chaplain to Prince William of Orange, and other English and Scottish radicals (including John Locke) in escalating the conflict between William and his father-in-law, James VII and II. Late in 1686 William Penn, sent by James to try to persuade exiles to accept pardons and return to Britain, told James he thought he had persuaded Stewart of the rightness of the king's toleration policies and that Stewart could build support for them among Scottish Presbyterians if given a pardon. James offered one, and Stewart accepted it in May 1687, going to London in July to join the government under John Drummond, earl of Melfort, then secretary of state for Scotland. In that capacity, he wrote letters to Carstares setting forth and offering defences for James's policies&#151;repeal of the penal laws for nonconformity and of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> (which excluded Catholics from office). Carstares showed his letters to William of Orange and Gaspar Fagel, the grand pensionary, who in a widely published <span class="italic">Letter &hellip; to Mr. James Stewart, advocate: giving an account of the prince and princess of Orange's thoughts concerning the repeal of the test, and the penal laws</span> (1687) used them as a foil opposite which to cast William and Mary's policy for removal of the penal laws but maintenance of the test&#151;and, crucially, for calling a freely elected parliament. Stewart wrote a reply on James's behalf, <span class="italic">James Steuarts Answer to a Letter Write by Mijn Heer Fagel</span>, published in May 1688. Although some writers (including Macaulay in his <span class="italic">History of England</span>) have interpreted Stewart's actions as betraying his principles, there is good evidence from which to infer that in serving in James's government Stewart was neither a convert to James's policies nor a trimmer, but a double agent. In January 1687&#151;after Penn thought him converted to James's policies&#151;he wrote a <span class="italic">Memorial for the Prince of Orange</span>, in which he argued strongly that James's policies of toleration were only a temporary means to the end of re-establishing Catholicism. On 3 July 1687, the night before leaving the Netherlands, he met with and promised inviolable fidelity to the prince of Orange. After the Revolution, he &#145;bragged to hundreds, that he gave several advices, designedly to ruin&#146; James's government  (Lindsay, 3.214n.). Once king, William soon tapped him for high office, appointing him first prosecutor and then, in 1692, lord advocate of Scotland. His continued good relations with Scottish Presbyterians, capped by his authorship of most of the religious settlement after the revolution, would be inexplicable if his contemporaries had believed that he had betrayed his principles to accept the pardon and serve under Melfort. It is impossible to reconcile James's doctrine of royal supremacy&#151;both civil and religious&#151;with Stewart's adamant support for constitutional, parliamentarily limited monarchy and rejection of Erastianism. Whatever the case, King James appears to have trusted Stewart, for in January 1688 he appointed him to assist Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh in prosecutions in Scotland, and in May he assigned him to answer Fagel.<br>
<br>Following the revolution, Stewart became one of the chief advisers of the whig party in Scotland and wrote the act&#151;introduced into parliament by his brother Sir Thomas Stewart of Coltness (1631&#150;1698) in June 1690&#151;ratifying the Westminster confession, establishing Presbyterianism, and abolishing patronage in Scotland. As lord advocate (1692&#150;1709, 1711&#150;1713; appointed 28 November 1692; commissioned 10 December and admitted 26 December 1692), he wrote much of the government's report (April 1695) on the Glencoe massacre (February 1692); procured passage of an act establishing the Scottish East India Company (June 1695); prosecuted Melfort, the earl of Middleton, and others for treason for assisting James VII and II in attempting to regain the throne (July 1695), and Thomas Aikenhead for blasphemy (December 1696); and drafted Scotland's habeas corpus act (1701). Although he opposed the union of the parliaments (1707), as lord advocate he was able to do little to hinder it. He also drafted many of the public papers of the Church of Scotland between 1690 and his death.<br>
<br>Stewart was widely respected not only for legal and political prowess but also for religious devotion and theological and ecclesiastical acumen, and when he died on 1 May 1713, at Advocates' Close, Edinburgh, of complications stemming from crippling gout, the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, then in session, recessed to attend his funeral and burial in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh. George Lockhart of Carnwath described him as a great man, a profound lawyer, the chief support of presbytery, and a virulent enemy of the royal house of Stuart  (Burnet, 3.214n.). The Scottish minister and church historian Robert Wodrow, who knew him personally, called him &#145;a person every way eminent for religion, learning, and law, and far above any character in my power to give&#146;  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 2.202&#150;8). A tall man, Stewart was crippled by gout, leading to debilitating obesity, during the last seven years of his life. An oil portrait (1712) of him by Sir John Medina hangs in the library of the writers to the signet in Parliament House, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Stewart's other significant writings include <span class="italic">The Index or Abridgement of the Acts of Parliament &hellip; 1424 [to] 1707</span> (1st edn, 1685; rev. edn, 1707; reprinted 1715), <span class="italic">The Oath of Abjuration Set in its True Light</span> (1712), and <span class="italic">Dirleton's Doubts and Questions in the Law of Scotland, Resolved and Answered</span> (2nd edn, 1762). Stewart had three children with his first wife, Agnes (or Anna) Trail: two daughters, Marion (1679&#150;1727) and Anna (<i>b</i>. 1680), and a son, James (1681&#150;1727), who became Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees and Coltness, baronet, solicitor-general, whose son Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees and Coltness, baronet (1713&#150;1780), wrote <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy</span> (1770; to which, in many respects, Adam Smith's <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</span>, 1776, was a response), and who ironically (granted his grandfather's opposition to the Stuart regime) sided with Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, in 1745. With his second wife, Margaret Air (<i>d</i>. 1743), Stewart had four children: two sons, Henry Steuart Barclay of Collernie and Robert Steuart of Newmains, and two daughters, Susan (1699&#150;1723) and Margaret.<br>
