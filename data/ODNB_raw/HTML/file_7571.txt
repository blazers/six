<span class="headword">Devis,  Arthur William</span>  (1762&#150;1822), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in London on 10 August 1762, the nineteenth child of the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7570/', "Arthur Devis (1712&#150;1787)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Faulkner (1723&#150;1788), and the nephew of the landscape painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62466/', "Anthony Devis (1729&#150;1816/17)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7570/', "Devis, Arthur")</script>].<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Arthur William Devis received his early art education from his father but was enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools at the age of only twelve. Although he exhibited a handful of works at the Free Society and the Royal Academy, little is known of Devis's early career until his father obtained for him the post of draughtsman aboard the <i>Antelope</i>, a messenger ship commissioned to sail to China by the East India Company. Devis was to be paid 100 guineas to make maps of the islands in the South China Sea. On the outward journey he was wounded in the chest and jaw when the <i>Antelope</i> stopped off the coast of New Guinea to trade with natives who had paddled out to them. The ship's captain, Henry Wilson, recorded in his log that &#145;suddenly the people in the boats discharged a flight of arrows at us&#146;  (MS log of the <i>Antelope</i>, 1 April 1783, BL OIOC, L/Mar/B/570A). Devis was not severely injured but the face wound caused him &#145;a locked jaw, by which he suffered to the last moment of his life&#146;  (undated appeal, <i>c</i>.1822, Biddulph papers).<br>
<br>The <i>Antelope</i> reached Macau in June 1783. After repairs had been made and sixteen Chinese sailors engaged to supplement the crew, the <i>Antelope</i> began the return journey. In early August the ship ran aground on an uncharted coral reef close to a group of islands now known as Palau, or Belau more locally. All but one of the crew survived and Devis, who evidently had salvaged his drawing materials, recorded the construction of a smaller ship made from the wreck of the <i>Antelope</i>. Captain Wilson described the extraordinary adventures of the crew, in which Devis figured prominently, as they made the acquaintance of the &#145;Pelew&#146; islanders and assisted them to conquer the neighbouring islands. Devis's studies of the king of Pelew and his wives were used to illustrate George Keate's <span class="italic">Account of the Pelew Islands</span>, first published in 1788. Several Pelew landscapes and portraits were exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution between 1796 and 1807.<h2>
<a name="India17841795"></a>India, 1784&#150;1795</h2>In their newly constructed ship, the <i>Oroolong</i>, named after the small island on which they had landed, the crew returned to Macau and eventually to England, except for Devis, who sailed from there for Calcutta in September 1784. Johann Zoffany and Thomas Hickey were both well-established portrait painters in Calcutta at that time but Devis nevertheless found himself initially in great demand. He received lucrative portrait commissions from the departing governor-general, Warren Hastings, and from the high court judge Sir Robert Chambers and his wife, whose portraits are in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut. His portrait of John Addison, the resident judge at Moorshadabad (Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston), is an excellent example of Devis's early portrait style. Addison's elongated limbs and bold outline are reminiscent of Arthur Devis senior's portraits, which were dependent on the use of the lay figure. Placed in such an exotic setting, and contrasted with the bulk of the elephants behind him and a naturalistic group of Indian servants, the figure emanates a sense of classical poise and elegance.<br>
<br>Devis was at the centre of a scandal involving a fellow artist, John Alefounder. When in 1785 Alefounder fell ill, Devis sold many of Alefounder's paintings and materials to pay off his friend's immediate creditors. Alefounder publicly accused Devis of acting maliciously and years later, when Alefounder committed suicide in 1794, the rumours resurfaced and followed Devis home. Devis was unable to obtain sufficient patronage as a portrait painter in Calcutta to support himself. While travelling around Madras and Bengal in search of patrons he began collecting material for an ambitious series of subject paintings depicting &#145;the arts, manufactures, and agriculture of Bengal&#146;, which was to be engraved in colour and dedicated to the orientalist Sir William Jones, who was painted by Devis in 1793 (BL). Only four of the engravings were ever published but the thirty paintings provide a unique record of life in rural Bengal, combining loosely painted, delicately coloured landscapes, a naturalistic figure style with occasional touches of classicism, and finely observed still-life elements. These paintings are dispersed among the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, and a number of private collections.<br>
<br>Devis was back in Calcutta in 1792, when he was commissioned to paint the portrait of Governor-General Cornwallis following his military victory over Tipu Sultan, the &#145;tiger of Mysore&#146;. Two of Tipu's sons were taken hostage by Cornwallis and Devis painted the elaborate handing-over ceremony in his most ambitious work to date (<span class="italic">Lord Cornwallis Receiving the Sons of Tipu Sultan as Hostages</span>). At least three versions of the event were completed (all priv. colls.), the largest, measuring over 4 metres in length, has over sixty portraits of officers and Indian dignitaries.<br>
<br>Despite receiving astronomically high fees, notably &pound;2530 for his portrait of Cornwallis, Devis struggled financially and eventually decided to return to England, setting sail in January 1795. He had recently made what was generally considered to be an unwise marriage to an actress, Mrs Coombes. Instead of returning with him to England, she travelled first to Lisbon, then to Paris, and finally to Verdun, where she died in 1805, shortly after her release from a debtors' prison.<h2>
<a name="Londonc17951822"></a>London c.1795&#150;1822</h2>In the late 1790s Devis struggled to establish himself as an artist in London, relying on portrait commissions from his Indian connections but also exhibiting landscapes, animal paintings, and theatrical subjects. His full-length portrait <span class="italic">Sir William Pitt Amherst</span> (Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston), dating from 1803, shows Devis competing in scale, drama, and the bravura handling of paint with Thomas Lawrence's portraits in the grand manner. By 1800, however, he was bankrupt and was saved from prison only through the intervention of John Biddulph, a friend and long-term patron whom Devis had probably met in India. Biddulph bought up many of the paintings seized by Devis's creditors following his bankruptcy. By 1803 Devis owed over &pound;2000 to Biddulph, who was forced to refuse further financial help. Devis contracted still more debts on behalf of a failing dressmaking business owned by his sister and Margaret Lanchester, who was to become his second wife.<br>
<br>Devis was imprisoned in 1804, gaining his release in November or December the following year to gather material for what would be his most famous work, <span class="italic">The Death of Nelson</span> (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;7; NMM). A prize of &pound;500 had been offered by the engraver Josiah Boydell in November 1805 for the best representation of the subject and Devis saw this as a major opportunity to clear his debts and establish his reputation as a painter of modern history. He joined the <span class="italic">Victory</span> at Spithead in December, and made sketches of Nelson's body (he was present when &#145;the fatal ball&#146; was removed from his body) as well as portrait studies of all those who had been present, after determining precisely where each one had stood at the moment of Nelson's death. Devis's documentary approach prompted a hostile response from Benjamin West, who complained that the painting was not an &#145;Epic representation&#146; and that Nelson should not have been pictured &#145;like a sick man in a Prison Hole&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.150). Following the popular success of the painting (oil sketch exh. by Boydell, 1807; Royal Collection; finished painting exh. British Institution, 1809) and Boydell's engraving, Devis applied for associate status of the Royal Academy. He was summarily rejected for &#145;irregular living&#146;&#151;the circumstances of his first marriage, the Alefounder scandal, and his bankruptcy all telling against him.<br>
<br>From 1807 until his death in 1822 Devis managed to stay ahead of his creditors and resumed his friendship with the Biddulph family. He established a reputation as a painter of child portraits, many of which were engraved. He also produced several history paintings, collaborating with John Augustus Atkinson on <span class="italic">The Battle of Waterloo</span> (watercolour and engraving, <i>c</i>.1816&#150;1818; BM), which was engraved by Boydell in 1819. In his later years he painted a number of large-scale group portraits and ambitious single-figure portraits such as his portrait of the actress Eliza O'Neill as <span class="italic">Belvidera &hellip; a Greek Courtesan</span> (exh. British Institution, 1816; Wolverhampton Art Gallery), which compares favourably with William Beechey's large-scale portraits.<br>
<br>In his final years Devis received royal patronage. <span class="italic">The Apotheosis of Princess Charlotte</span> (<i>c</i>.1819; Belgian Royal Collection), complete with swirling drapery and flying cherubs, was painted for the bereaved Prince Leopold, and demonstrates the continuing influence of a Reynoldsian neo-classical influence throughout Devis's career. A mezzotint after the work was published in 1820, as was an engraving after his portrait of Queen Caroline (1820; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), the wife of George IV.<br>
<br>Devis died suddenly on 11 February 1822 at his home at Caroline Street, Bedford Square, London, and was buried in the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields. He left his wife, children, and sisters unprovided for. His studio contained numerous unfinished portraits of titled sitters, as well as Indian, religious, and genre subjects and over 4000 fashion plates, for many of which Devis had provided the designs.<br>
<br>With the majority of his paintings in private collections, many in India and America, Devis's reputation quickly dwindled, resting almost entirely on <span class="italic">The Death of Nelson</span>, which remained a national icon well into the twentieth century. Since the 1970s several important works have appeared in the salerooms, including works from the Indian Manufactures series, helping to re-establish Devis as one of the more gifted and innovative followers of Reynolds. The Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston, the British Museum, London, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, have large collections of his work.<br>
