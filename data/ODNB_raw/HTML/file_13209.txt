<span class="headword">Hickey,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Martin Doyle]</span>  (1787&#150;1875), <span class="occ">writer and philanthropist</span>, was born in Murragh, co. Cork, the eldest son of Ambrose Hickey DD, rector of Murragh. After spending five terms at Trinity College, Dublin (1804&#150;5), he was admitted a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 7 March 1806 and then became a scholar there. His father was admitted fellow-commoner at the same college three days later. Hickey took a BA at both Cambridge and Dublin in 1809, and took an MA at Dublin in 1832.<br>
<br>In 1811 Hickey was ordained, and he became curate of Dunleckny in the diocese of Leighlin. In 1813 he married Henrietta Maria, only daughter of John Steuart, of Steuart's Lodge, co. Carlow. He moved in 1820 to become vicar of Bannow, in the diocese of Ferns. While there he built a glebe house, restored the fabric of the church, and with Thomas Boyce of Bannow House founded Bannow agricultural school on a farm of 40 acres. With Boyce he also established the South Wexford Agricultural Society, the first of its kind in Ireland. In 1826 Hickey moved to the rectory of Kilcormick, where he built a new church and a schoolhouse, and initiated the building of roads and bridges. In 1831 he was advanced to the rectory of Wexford, and finally, in 1834, to Mulrankin. He was also rural dean of Tacumshane.<br>
<br>Hickey was concerned about the poor condition of the Irish farmer. As early as 1817 he produced a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">State of the Poor in Ireland</span>. His first substantial work on farming was written, like his subsequent publications, under the pseudonym of Martin Doyle. It was originally issued in the <span class="italic">Wexford Herald</span> in the form of letters to the editor, as &#145;Hints to small farmers&#146;, and after publication in a collected form in 1830 it passed through many editions, of which the last appeared in 1867. For the rest of his life a steady stream of practical handbooks on agriculture and gardening appeared. His many publications included <span class="italic">Hints to Small Holders on Planting and on Cattle</span> (1830), <span class="italic">Practical Gardening</span> (1833), <span class="italic">A Cyclopaedia of Practical Husbandry</span> (1839), <span class="italic">Small Farms: a Practical Treatise Intended for Persons Inexperienced in Husbandry</span> (1855), and <span class="italic">Cottage Farming</span> (1870). Hickey also contributed regularly to several periodicals, including <span class="italic">Blackwood's Agricultural Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, and <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>. With Edmund Murphy he launched the <span class="italic">Irish Farmer's and Gardener's Magazine</span> in 1834. He also edited <span class="italic">The Illustrated Book of Domestic Poultry</span> (1854).<br>
<br>Hickey was a member of the Royal Dublin Society, and was awarded their gold medal in recognition of his services to Ireland. Between 1863 and 1873 he received a series of grants from the Royal Literary Fund. He died comparatively poor on 24 October 1875 at Mulrankin. His granddaughter was the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40428/', "Emily Henrietta Hickey")</script>.<br>
