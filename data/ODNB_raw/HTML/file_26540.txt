<span class="headword">Stock,  Richard</span>  (1568/9&#150;1626), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in York. Having matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in his nineteenth year he was elected scholar on 10 November 1587, graduated BA in 1591, and proceeded MA in 1594. The latter degree was incorporated at Oxford on 15 July 1595. Samuel Clarke recorded that William Whitaker, master of St John's, approved of Stock &#145;for his ingenuity, industry and proficiency in his studies&#146;, but no fellowship at St John's was then available. He was offered one instead at newly endowed Sidney Sussex (whose first master was James Montague), but left Cambridge before the college buildings were completed and thereafter had &#145;no mind&#146; to return there  (Clarke, 61).<br>
<br>According to Clarke, Stock became chaplain to Sir Anthony Cope of Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire, and then to Lady Lane of Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, thereafter gravitating to London. Clarke fails to mention that his reason for doing so was probably his appointment as chaplain to Sir William Knollys (from 1616 Viscount Wallingford), controller and then treasurer of the royal household between 1596 and 1616. Probably in 1599 or 1600 Stock also became lecturer at St Augustine and served as curate to Thomas Earle of nearby St Mildred, Bread Street. After Earle's death in 1604 he assisted Thomas Edmunds (<i>d</i>. 1611), rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, by that time too infirm to do duty. Accordingly it was Stock who baptized the poet John Milton on 20 December 1608 and took up the parish's newly endowed lectureship. In March 1611 he was collated rector there by the dean and chapter of Canterbury during the brief vacancy of the primatial see between the death of Richard Bancroft and the translation of George Abbot.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, under Knollys's patronage Stock had emerged as an anti-Catholic polemicist. Probably in 1605 he presented Knollys with a &#145;small treatise&#146;, now apparently lost, whereupon Knollys showed him an English translation of Campion's <span class="italic">Rationes decem</span>, &#145;lately taken in a Papists house&#146;, and &#145;commanded&#146; him to translate William Whitaker's <span class="italic">Ad rationes decem &hellip; responsio</span> (1581) in riposte  (Stock, <span class="italic">An Answere</span>, sigs. 2<i>v</i>&#150;3<i>r</i>). This appeared in 1606 as <span class="italic">An answere to the ten reasons of Edmund Campian &hellip; whereunto is added in briefe marginall notes, the summe of the defence of those reasons by John Duraeus the Scot</span>. On 2 November 1606, at Paul's Cross, Stock delivered a denunciation of Catholicism, sober to the point of dullness and heavily dependent on scriptural and patristic texts.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Doctrine and Use of Repentance, Preached in Sundrie Sermons</span> (1608) was followed by the publication in 1609 of his Paul's Cross sermon with a vivid dedication to James Montague, now bishop of Bath and Wells. Stock entreated Montague, as one close to King James, to &#145;excite&#146; him &#145;to waken his sleeping lawes, that as he hath long sung mercie, he would at length tune justice &hellip; lest he may seeme to succeeding ages to forget both his God &amp; himself, his posteritie, &amp; people&#146;. Now that Montague was consecrated, &#145;who knoweth whether you are come to such a place for such a purpose? and whether, when some would have cast you out, you have by God bene kept in, to such an end?&#146; Stock recalled Montague's &#145;auncient favour&#146; towards him at Cambridge for his &#145;good and preferment&#146; there and &#145;the renewing of the same many wayes&#146; ever since  (R. Stock, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Paules Cross, the Second of November 1606</span>, 1609, sigs. *4<i>v</i>&#150;*6<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In 1614 came <span class="italic">The Churches Lamentation for the Losse of the Godly</span>, Stock's funeral sermon for Montague's kinsman John Harington, second Lord Harington of Exton. The dedication to Harington's sister, Lucy Russell, countess of Bedford, speaks of Harington's &#145;love&#146; for him and the &#145;bountie&#146; he had received from the countess  (sig. A2). Thereafter Stock published nothing, probably because of his conviction that his vocation was &#145;not to write, but to preach&#146; and because of the &#145;corruption in our times&#146; which made writing &#145;less profitable, because I see men buy bookes more for the Author, than the matter&#146;. Of his contemporaries, however, he especially commended Thomas Bilson, William Fulke, and Andrew Willet for their anti-Catholic teaching and for &#145;matter of conscience&#146; the works of Richard Greenham, Richard Rogers, and William Perkins  (R. Stock, <span class="italic">An Answere to the Ten Reasons of Edmund Campian</span>, 1606, sigs. &#928;[1]<i>v</i>&#150;3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Although Stock never seems to have been arraigned for nonconformist practices of any kind he became one of the original feoffees for impropriations, who by the end of James's reign were administering a trust for the purchase of impropriate rectories with the object of restoring them to the church. He was appointed one of the overseers of the will of the London minister Stephen Egerton in 1622, but thereafter his decline seems to have been rapid: from 1623 he employed the future bishop of Chester, Brian Walton, as his curate and made his own will over a year before his death, on 1 April 1625. There were bequests to his daughters, Prudence, Sara, and Judith (<i>bap</i>. 1618); to a brother, George; and to a sister, Mistress Mills. His wife, Prudence (<i>d</i>. 1662), was appointed sole executor. Although he remembered none of his fellow feoffees &pound;30 was left for &#145;the releife of such poore ministers and ministers widdowes&#146; as his wife and overseers should &#145;think fitt and appoint&#146;. Walton, his &#145;minister and helpe&#146;, received &pound;5  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/149, fols. 6<i>v</i>&#150;7<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Stock died on 20 April 1626 and was buried in his church four days later. His parishioners erected a monument, destroyed in the great fire, but the inscription is preserved by Benjamin Brook. His funeral sermon, published as <span class="italic">Abrahams Decease</span> (1627), was preached by Thomas Gataker, who had known him since going up to Cambridge. In his epistle dedicatory to Sir Henry Yelverton, a parishioner of All Hallows, Bread Street, Gataker noted that Yelverton &#145;did in more than ordinary manner respect his person&#146;  (Gataker, sig. A3<i>v</i>) and asserted that at Cambridge, Stock had been an inspiration to many, including himself. He recalled Stock's &#145;freedome of speech&#146; in reproving sin, &#145;even to the faces of the greatest, both in publike and private, when occasion required it&#146;, and his &#145;zealous and earnest pursuit of reformation of prophanations of the Sabbath&#146;. He also remembered his &#145;discreet carriage in the catechizing of the younger sort&#146;  (ibid., 11). Gataker omits mention of his status as a feoffee but implies that he worked himself to death, in his last years praying constantly for release from illness so that he might continue his ministry.<br>
<br>Two posthumous works appeared in 1641, no doubt as part of the parliamentary effort to reinstate the claims of &#145;godly&#146; preaching. Without stating how he obtained the manuscript James Cranford published <span class="italic">A Stock of Divine Knowledge, being a Lively Description of the Divine Nature</span>, with a dedicatory epistle to Anne, Lady Yelverton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27570/', "Samuel Torshell")</script>, who had married Stock's daughter Prudence, brought out <span class="italic">A Learned and Very Usefull Commentary upon &hellip; Malachy</span>, dedicating it to all Stock's &#145;ancient Friends and Hearers&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>). This was reprinted in 1865 with a verbose memoir by Alexander Grosart. Stock left no manuscripts, but copious notes from two sermon-cycles delivered in 1606&#150;7 on <span class="roman">Malachi</span> and the first epistle of <span class="roman">St John</span> are preserved in the commonplace book of Gilbert Frevile.<br>
