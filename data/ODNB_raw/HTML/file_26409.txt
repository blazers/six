<span class="headword">Stern,  Henry Aaron</span>  (1820&#150;1885), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, the son of German Jewish parents, Aaron and Hanna Stern, was born in the village of Unterreichenbach, near Gelnhausen in the grand duchy of Hesse and by Rhine, Germany, on 11 April 1820. When he was twelve years old his family moved to Judengasse, the Jewish quarter of Frankfurt am Main. His father hoped he would become a doctor, but he begged to be allowed to go into commerce. At the age of seventeen he was sent for business training in Hamburg. There he met a representative of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews, and, in 1839, was offered a good commercial post in London. On reaching England he found that the company had failed. Reluctant to return home admitting defeat, he turned to the London society's chapel in Palestine Place and was baptized on 15 March 1840. He was placed in the society's Operative Jewish Converts' Institution and became a skilled printer; in 1842 he entered the society's Hebrew College, to become a missionary to the Jews.<br>
<br>Stern began his missionary career in 1844 when he was dispatched to &#145;benighted&#146; Asia Minor. He travelled by way of Palestine, where he was ordained deacon by the Anglican bishop of Jerusalem, Michael Alexander, another Jewish convert. Later that year he proceeded to Baghdad, and visited Babylon and Basrah. In 1847 he embarked on a missionary tour of Persia, giving sermons to both Muslims and Jews. He returned to England in 1849 and was ordained a clergyman by the bishop of London, in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, on 23 December. He returned to Baghdad in 1850 and remained there until 1853. During this time he completed his <span class="italic">Dawnings of light in the East: with biblical, historical, and statistical notices of persons and places visited during a mission to the Jews, in Persia, Coordistan, and Mesopotamia</span> (1854). In 1853 he was promoted head of his society's establishment in Constantinople, where he stayed for three years. Then, after the Crimean War, he proceeded to the Crimea, visiting the little-known Caraite Jews; later he undertook a missionary expedition to the Jews of San&#145;a&#146; and elsewhere in Arabia. He returned to Constantinople in 1856, where he remained three more years, during which he wrote his <span class="italic">Journal of a Missionary Journey into Arabia Felix</span> (1858). On his travels he was accompanied by his British-born wife, Charlotte Elizabeth, second daughter of Charles Henry Purday, of Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London, whom he married on 2 April 1850.<br>
<br>The most important phase of Stern's life began in 1859 when his society turned its attention to the Falashas, or Judaic Ethiopians. Travelling by way of Jerusalem, Cairo, and the Sudan, he reached the camp of the reforming Ethiopian emperor, T&eacute;wodros II, early in 1860. The monarch received him kindly, and allowed him to preach, subject to consent from the <i>abun</i>, or patriarch, Abba Salama. This was readily given, on the understanding that Falasha converts would be baptized into the Ethiopian church. Stern, an arrogant bigot, was not appreciative. He had a poor opinion of both leaders, and referred to T&eacute;wodros, derogatorily, as &#145;his black majesty&#146;. He later established his headquarters at Janda, and visited Falasha settlements in north-western Ethiopia before returning to Britain, where he completed his <span class="italic">Wanderings Among the Falashas in Abyssinia</span> (1862); he went back to Ethiopia towards the end of 1861 and appointed four Ethiopians to teach as his subordinates.<br>
<br>This was a critical time in Anglo-Ethiopian relations. T&eacute;wodros, influenced by what he had heard of Britain from a previous British consul, Walter Plowden, wrote to Queen Victoria in November 1862, proposing to send her an embassy. The British Foreign Office, unwilling to offend T&eacute;wodros's enemy, the Ottoman empire, ignored his letter. The emperor, never a man to be trifled with, was incensed. His anger against the British government extended to Stern, whom he summoned to Gondar in October 1863. Stern and a fellow missionary, H. Rosenthal, were beaten and chained. They were imprisoned at Gondar, and later at T&eacute;wodros's mountain fortress of Maqdala (Magdala). The British consul Charles Duncan Cameron and several other Europeans were likewise incarcerated and chained. Stern, considered insolent, received particularly harsh treatment and was indicted for passages in his <span class="italic">Wanderings Among the Falashas</span>, which threw doubt on the emperor's royal descent and stated that his mother had sold the traditional Ethiopian tapeworm medicine, the taenicide <i>kosso</i>.<br>
<br>The position of Stern and his fellow captives seemed about to change in July 1864 when Hormuzd Rassam, the assistant to the British political resident in Aden, arrived at Massawa with a letter from Queen Victoria. Rassam's coming was delayed until 28 January 1866, after which Stern and the other prisoners were freed from their chains, on 24 February. They were then brought, on 12 March, to Qorata by Lake Tana, where Rassam was encamped, prior to their expected departure from Ethiopia, on 13 April. Unfortunately, Rassam had failed to resolve the dispute between T&eacute;wodros and the British government; instead of releasing the prisoners the monarch therefore sought to use them to exact concessions from London. He tried the captives in public and dispatched them again to Maqdala. They arrived on 12 July and four days later were put in chains. Closely guarded, they were nevertheless able to communicate with British officials and with their families and friends, from whom they received ample funds.<br>
<br>The detention of Stern and his companions was widely publicized by Mrs Stern. The imprisonment of Cameron and Rassam was, however, politically more important, for it caused the British government to decide on military intervention. An expedition commanded by Sir Robert Cornelis Napier was dispatched from Bombay in the summer of 1867. News of the British landing at Annesley Bay (Zula) was joyfully received by Stern and his party on 13 December. The British crossed northern Ethiopia without opposition. The first engagement took place below Maqdala, on 10 April 1868, when T&eacute;wodros's army was overwhelmed by British superiority in weapons. The emperor, wishing to make peace, released Stern and the other Europeans, but Napier decided to storm Maqdala, on 13 April. T&eacute;wodros, to escape capture, committed suicide. Maqdala, to Stern's satisfaction, was burnt to the ground on 17 April, after which the British expedition withdrew from Ethiopia.<br>
<br>Stern immediately returned to Britain. He wrote an account of his experiences in <span class="italic">The Captive Missionary: Being an Account of the Country and People of Abyssinia</span> (1868), and lectured widely on the subject. The London society opened a subscription for him which raised &pound;336. In poor health and unwilling to venture again far from home he devoted himself to the conversion of Jews in Britain. His society appointed him its senior London missionary on 1 January 1871. He took up residence at Palestine Place, superintended the society's Wanderers' Home, and preached many sermons to would-be Jewish converts. The archbishop of Canterbury later conferred a doctorate of divinity on him, in 1881, and his society elected him a member of their council in 1884. His first wife, Charlotte, having died on 1 January 1874, he married Rebecca Davis, daughter of S. D. Goff, of Horetown, co. Wexford, on 3 March 1883. He died two years later, on 13 May 1885, at his home, 5 Cambridge Lodge Villas, Mare Street, Hackney, London, and was buried on 18 May in the City of London cemetery at Ilford, Essex.<br>
