<span class="headword">Alexander,  Peter</span>  (1893&#150;1969), <span class="occ">literary editor and scholar</span>, was born on 19 September 1893, at 3 Great George Street, Hillhead, Glasgow, the only son of Robert Alexander (1844&#150;1900) of Glasgow, schoolmaster and later head teacher, and Christina Cameron McDonald Munn (1863&#150;1949), schoolmistress. After his father's death in 1900 Alexander attended John Watson's school, Edinburgh, and, from 1907, Whitehill higher grade school in the east of Glasgow. In October 1911 he entered the University of Glasgow, enrolling in Latin and mathematics. In his second year at university, he joined the English and moral philosophy classes. The English literature department consisted of the regius professor, W. Macneile Dixon, Dr John Semple Smart, and two assistants. Alexander always regarded Smart as a determining influence and much later was to edit his posthumous book <span class="italic">Shakespeare: Truth and Tradition</span> (1928).<br>
<br>In 1914 Alexander interrupted his studies to enlist with the Cameron Highlanders and was in July 1916 commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery. He spent these war years on the western front, ending as a captain and returning to the university in 1919. He took an honours degree in 1920, gaining the most distinguished first of the year, and was awarded the valuable George A. Clark scholarship. This would have enabled him to research into his particular topic of interest, <span class="italic">2</span> and <span class="italic">3 Henry VI</span>, for a further four years. He used that scholarship as a means of financing travel in Italy and had meant to spend a subsequent period in France. In the event, a vacancy occurred in the department, and Alexander was appointed lecturer in English literature as from October 1921.<br>
<br>On 15 June 1923 Alexander married Agnes Effie Macdonald, who had been his fellow student in the honours school. She was the daughter of the late Revd Angus Macdonald, minister of the United Free Church of Scotland. There were three sons: Peter, who, as a lieutenant in the Royal Tank regiment, was killed in Normandy in July 1944; Donald, who was reader in medicine at Glasgow University; and Nigel, who became a professor of English in the University of London.<br>
<br>Alexander's most original work was <span class="italic">Shakespeare's &#145;Henry VI&#146; and &#145;Richard III&#146;</span> (1929) in which he argued that plays long taken to have been crude sources for Shakespeare, such as <span class="italic">The Contention betwixt the Two Famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster</span> (1594) and <span class="italic">The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke</span> (1595), were in fact inaccurate transcriptions of the already existing <span class="italic">2</span> and <span class="italic">3 Henry VI</span>. This gives us a more sophisticated Shakespeare&#151;as, indeed, the relatively polished early plays <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> and <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span> might have led us to suspect.<br>
<br>In his various Shakespeare books, such as <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Life and Art</span> (1939) and his replacement for John Masefield's <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> in the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span> (1964), Alexander showed little awareness of the principles of interpretation as evinced by his contemporary G. Wilson Knight. Rather than acknowledging the new criticism or anticipating cultural materialism, he built upon his predecessor, A. C. Bradley. His most lasting achievement was an edition of Shakespeare prepared for Collins (1951). This one-volume collection proved convenient for professors speaking at conferences or visiting other universities. It could frequently be seen in the hands of Shakespearians such as L. C. Knights, who might well have found Alexander's ventures into the critical field simplistic. There can be no doubt that it had popular appeal for students and for the literate public at large.<br>
<br>However, the very accessibility of this edition was somewhat misleading. It conflated the quarto and folio versions of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and <span class="italic">Othello</span>, producing centos rather than texts. Alexander omitted such works as <span class="italic">Edward III</span> and <span class="italic">The Two Noble Kinsmen</span> that have as much of Shakespeare in them as <span class="italic">1 Henry VI</span>, which he included. He promulgated readings which some have found problematic, such as &#145;'a babbl'd of green fields&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry V</span>, II.iii) and &#145;arm-gaunt steed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, I.iv) without due comment. However, how could he have found room for extensive annotation in a popular edition of Shakespeare's works? Compromise was inherent in the undertaking.<br>
<br>Upon the retirement of Macneile Dixon in 1935, Alexander assumed the regius professorship, which he held until 1963. This tenure was temporarily interrupted when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he re-enlisted in the army, being posted to the Middle East in 1940 and returning to Glasgow as a major in 1943. He made few reforms to the syllabus, other than removing the study of history from the English honours school. It was mostly his own graduates that he appointed to lectureships, and even then he revealed a prejudice against appointing women. His solitary lady lecturer, a temporary appointment, found herself rebuked for &#145;wasting the time of his young men&#146;. Stricture from such a source would have been formidable. An impressive lecturer, with his square jaw and bushy eyebrows, Alexander seemed to regard research as a subsidiary activity. In that whole tenure, only one scholar of note, Ernst Honigmann, emerged from his department.<br>
<br>In retirement Alexander was invited to lecture at New York University and Trinity College, Dublin, and he returned to New York, where he had proved especially effective, from 1965 to 1967. He had been elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1951, appointed CBE in 1964, and awarded an honorary degree of LLD by the University of Aberdeen in 1966. Alexander died of lung cancer in hospital in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, on 18 June 1969. He was survived by his wife.<br>
