<span class="headword">Packer,  John</span>  (1572&#150;1649), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born at Twickenham, Middlesex, on 12 November 1572, the son of William Packer (<i>d</i>. 1600), clerk of the privy seal, and Elizabeth Borwell (<i>d</i>. 1611). He was educated at Westminster School and then matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 13 March 1590; during the same year he was admitted a scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge, and he took a BA degree in 1593&#150;4. He dedicated to Lord Burghley, addressed as Maecenas, a manuscript book of Greek and Latin verses which he composed while at Cambridge, entitled &#145;Elizabetha, sive, Augustissimae Anglorum principis encomium&#146;. After university Packer travelled in France and became secretary to Sir Henry Neville, English ambassador there from February 1599. After Neville's departure in August 1600 he acted as agent in France for a time. In July 1604 Packer was granted the reversion of a clerkship of the privy seal, and in March 1614, with Francis Godolphin, was made a protonotary of the chancery, for life. According to his son-in-law, he was also made French secretary. He enjoyed the patronage of the Sackville earls of Dorset, and in January 1610 reported that Thomas, Lord Dorset, had invited him to be his travelling companion in France. In the autumn of that year Packer was sent to Denmark as a special ambassador. His instructions concerned relations between Denmark and Sweden, and giving the Swedish delegates James I's response to the Swedish proposal for a marriage between Gustavus Adolphus, Charles IX's heir, and Princess Elizabeth. He returned in 1611.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1613, at the church of St Katharine Cree, London, Packer married Philippa (<i>bap</i>. 1590, <i>d</i>. 1665), daughter of Francis Mills of Westminster and Alice Jones. Four of their sons, Robert, George, Philip, and John, were educated at Oxford. Robert Packer (1616&#150;1687) was MP for Wallingford and married Temperance, daughter of Colonel Edward Stephens of Sodbury. George Packer (1617&#150;1641) was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. Philip Packer (1618&#150;1686) married Isabella, daughter of Sir Robert and Elizabeth Berkeley. Isabella died in 1664, and he then married, in 1666, Sarah Isgar of West Lavington, Wiltshire. He was paymaster of the king's works, usher of the exchequer, and an original fellow of the Royal Society. John Packer (1626&#150;1708) married Jane Fettiplace of Fernham, Berkshire, and was a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. William Packer (1627&#150;1655), fifth son of John and Philippa, married Jane Saunders of Woolston. Of his sisters, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1616) married in 1636 John Browne, clerk of the parliaments from 1638 until his death in 1691 (but not during the interregnum), and Katherine (1623&#150;1721) married John Gell of Kopton, Derbyshire. Frances was born in 1619 and died in 1633.<br>
<br>In 1612 Packer became secretary to Robert Carr, later earl of Somerset. After Somerset's fall, in 1615 Packer was appointed secretary to George Villiers, who was created successively earl, marquess, and duke of Buckingham, and held the post until Buckingham's assassination in 1628. According to John Browne he often acted as secretary to the king and declined offers to be made a secretary of state. Yet when, in February 1619, the king decided to appoint a new secretary of state he preferred Sir George Calvert to Packer and Dudley Carleton, both of whom were being promoted by Buckingham. When the king's preference became clear Buckingham dropped his support for Packer. His influence as Buckingham's secretary was considerable. In 1623 Isaac Barrow wrote from Cambridge seeking Packer's support for his, ultimately successful, efforts to obtain the post of regius professor of physic for John Gostlin, master of Gonville and Caius College. Packer enjoyed an appreciable income from fees and gratuities, as well as from other sources. In May 1614 he was one of four men granted a licence for thirty-one years for the manufacture of indigo neale; in March 1617 he was awarded an annual pension of &pound;115 from the court of wards on the surrender of a similar annuity from the exchequer and treasury of the chamber; and by 1635 he was receiving payments of &pound;292 per annum out of the duchy of Lancaster.<br>
<br>Packer acquired a considerable estate. He bought from Lord Dorset the manor of Groombridge in Kent and Sussex, and in 1620 the manor of Shellingford in Berkshire from Sir Henry Neville's son, also Sir Henry. In 1632 he acquired the manor of Shaw-cum-Donnington in the same county, and Charles I, on his coronation, gave him other lands in Berkshire, in recognition of his loyalty. His property included Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire and Berkshire, and land at Kingston Lisle, Fawler, and Baulking in Berkshire, and at Hams and Spencers in Sussex, which he held on lease from the earl of Dorset. He also owned a share of the New River Company. In 1625 Packer spent over &pound;500 on a new church at Groombridge, in thanksgiving for the king's safe return from Spain, as recorded in a Latin inscription on a tablet on the porch. He allowed a minister there &pound;30 per annum, and in his will provided an endowment of &pound;20 per annum for the minister's stipend. Also in 1625 he spent at least &pound;200 in work on St Faith's Church at Shellingford, which included the raising of a new spire and the erection of a new south porch. In 1629 he paid most of the cost of rebuilding St Mary's, Chilton Foliat, where the body of the church was rebuilt and re-roofed, and a new chancel screen was installed. John Browne's account mentions that at his own expense Packer sent ministers to preach in Lancashire, Staffordshire, Westmorland, south Wales, and &#145;other remote parts of the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Abergavenny MSS</span>, 174); he allowed them at least &pound;30 and in some cases &pound;50 per annum. He was a regular frequenter of sermons and an assiduous reader of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, knowing by heart the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>.<br>
<br>Packer sat as an MP for West Looe, Cornwall, in the parliament of 1628&#150;9. He made a number of brief interventions in debates and was appointed to several committees, some of which were to draft petitions to the king. His influence, and presumably fees and perquisites, fell after Buckingham's assassination, but in 1635 he served on a commission that enquired into the abuses of the Fleet prison in London, and on 1 May 1647 he was appointed a visitor of Oxford University. When the king asked for loans of money in March 1640, Packer refused. In November 1641 he donated &pound;100 for the affairs in Ireland. He was a supporter of parliament during the first civil war. The royalists sequestered his lands within their control and garrisoned Donnington Castle, which was largely ruined by the time that it was surrendered on 1 April 1646. Packer made his will in July 1645, directing that there should not be any feasting at his funeral, which would be &#145;very unfitting and unseasonable at such a time&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/209/153). This stipulation was not changed in the codicil he added in May 1648. Packer died at his house in the college at Westminster, and was buried at St Margaret's Church on 15 February 1649.<br>
<br>Browne praised Packer's behaviour to all who knew him, his lack of pride at his success and his charity, mentioning his donations to the poor clergy banished from the Palatinate and La Rochelle, and to the poor protestants of Ireland, and his bequest providing for the bringing up of Irish children as protestants. His other bequests included provision for medicines and surgery for the poor, &pound;100 for the poor at an almshouse, &pound;200 to young divinity students at Oxford and Cambridge, and sums for his servants. His wife, who acted as his executor, was buried at Shaw in Berkshire on 21 November 1665.<br>
<br>A collection of letters and state papers formed by Packer passed to G. H. Fortescue of Dropmore, Buckinghamshire, and in 1872 was deposited in the Bodleian Library. It was calendared by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, and in 1871 the Camden Society published a selection, edited by S. R. Gardiner.<br>
