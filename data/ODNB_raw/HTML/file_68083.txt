<span class="headword">Vavasour <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Finch, Richardson]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1580&#150;1621), <span class="occ">lady of the royal household</span>, was the daughter of Henry Vavasour of Copmanthorpe, Yorkshire, and Margaret Knyvet. Sworn as a gentlewoman of the bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth in 1580, she was serving within the year as one of the six maids of honour. This title proved all too ephemeral, for shortly after her arrival at court she became the mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28208/', "Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford (1550&#150;1604)")</script>, and on 23 March 1581 gave birth to his son in the maidens' chamber. The queen sent both parents to the Tower. Their son, Edward Vere, went on to a military career in the Netherlands and a knighthood (1607), probably under the tutelage of his paternal relatives Sir Francis and Sir Horace Vere.<br>
<br>By 1590 Anne had married one John Finch, but was probably already the mistress of the queen's champion at tilt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16288/', "Sir Henry Lee (1533&#150;1611)")</script>, with whom she also had a son, Thomas Vavasour, alias Freeman. Anne and Sir Henry lived openly together at Ditchley in Oxfordshire and his other country houses; indeed, they entertained Queen Anne at a lodge near Woodstock in September 1608. At Lee's death in 1611 Anne inherited a jointure worth &pound;700. By 1618 she had married a John Richardson, unmindful, apparently, that her first husband, Finch, was yet living. Lee's heir sued her for bigamy in the court of high commission, where she was fined &pound;2000 in 1621. A tomb with a quatrain verse epitaph was prepared for Anne in St Peter's Chapel at Quarrendon, where Sir Henry was buried:<blockquote>
<div>Under this stone entombed lies a fair &amp; worthy Dame<br>
</div>
<div>Daughter to Henry Vavasour, Anne Vavasour her name.<br>
</div>
<div>She living with Sir Henry Lee, for love long time did dwell<br>
</div>
<div>Death could not part them but here they rest within one cell.<br>
</div> (Lysons, and Lysons, 624)</blockquote>No further details of her career or death have come to light.<br>
<br>Anne is associated with several Elizabethan lyrics, none of which she is likely to have written. The text of &#145;Though I seem strange, sweet friend, be thou not so&#146; in Folger MS V.a.89, pages 8&#150;9, is subscribed &#145;Vavaser&#146;, but &#145;La. B. to N.&#146; in the British Library's Harley MS 6910, folio 145<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>. A partial text in Harley MS 7392 (2), folio 40, was at first assigned to &#145;H W&#146;; the initials were later crossed out in favour of &#145;Ball.&#146;, quite possibly an abbreviation for &#145;ballad&#146; in this anthology. The Folger manuscript also ascribes its copy of a poem on the Oxford&#150;Vavasour liaison (beginning &#145;Sitting alone upon my thought&#146;) to Anne; she and Oxford are named in connection with other manuscript versions of the poem, apparently to identify them as the principals in the work rather than its authors.<br>
<br>Anne is often confused with her niece, also Anne Vavasour who served as a gentlewoman of the privy chamber, <i>c</i>.1601&#150;3. In 1603 she married Sir Richard Warburton of London (<i>d</i>. 1610), the third son of Peter Warburton of Hefferston Grange, Weaversham, Cheshire, with Alice, daughter of John Cooper. Their son Cecil was Warburton's heir. This Anne was related to Anne Clifford and in the service of Lucy, countess of Bedford, before coming to court. She attended Elizabeth's funeral and received a pension of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. early in James's reign.<br>
