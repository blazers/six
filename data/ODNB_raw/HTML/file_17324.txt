<span class="headword">Macadam,  John</span>  (1827&#150;1865), <span class="occ">chemist and politician in Australia</span>, was born at Northbank, near Glasgow, in May 1827, the second son of William Macadam and his wife, Helen Stevenson. After being privately educated in Glasgow, he studied chemistry at the Andersonian Institution (1842&#150;5) and became assistant to Frederick Penny. After two years of advanced study with William Gregory at the University of Edinburgh, he became a medical student at the University of Glasgow in 1848, and graduated MD in 1854.<br>
<br>In 1855 Macadam went to Melbourne to fill the post of lecturer on chemistry and natural science at the Scotch College, and on 18 September of the following year he married Elizabeth Clark; they had one son, Kirkland Macadam, who later became the first professor of chemistry of the University of Melbourne. Macadam was one of the earliest members of the Philosophical Institute (from 1859 the Royal Society) of Victoria. He edited the first five volumes of the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and held the post of secretary from 1857 until his election as vice-president in 1863.<br>
<br>Macadam was active in Australian public affairs. He was elected to the legislative assembly of Victoria in 1859, representing the district of Castlemaine, and he served as secretary of the exploration committee of the Burke and Wills expedition. As an MP he was instrumental in the passing of laws on medical practitioners and adulteration of food in 1862 and 1863, but resigned his seat in 1864.<br>
<br>Macadam was appointed lecturer in theoretical and practical chemistry at the University of Melbourne in 1862, and also held the posts of government analytical chemist (1858&#150;65) and health officer to the city of Melbourne (1860&#150;65). In May 1865 he fractured his ribs and then developed pleurisy, but sailed in the autumn for New Zealand, to give evidence at a murder trial. Severe weather aggravated his condition, and he died on board the <i>Alhambra</i> on 2 September 1865. He was buried in Melbourne general cemetery on 28 September 1865.<br>
<br>Macadam was a talented analytical chemist, and published his work in Glasgow and Melbourne. He contributed two papers to the Royal Society, Victoria: &#145;On kerosene&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions</span>, 6, 1914), and &#145;On Dalton's atomic theory&#146; (not printed). He wrote several reports, including one on the resources of the colony of Victoria, presented to the Royal Society of Victoria in 1860.<br>
