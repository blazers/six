<span class="headword">Reynoldes,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">administrator and politician</span>, was born in Weymouth, Dorset, the second son of Lancelot Reynoldes of Melcombe Regis in that county, who came from a mercantile family which for successive generations had served as collectors of customs. He attended Southampton grammar school, where his schoolfellows included Thomas Lake, who was &#145;beholding unto me sometymes for his exercises&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/18/32). Reynoldes subsequently went to Oxford, where he graduated BA from All Souls on 4 March 1581, became a fellow the same year, and proceeded MA on 13 October 1584.<br>
<br>When Sir Amias Paulet was appointed as keeper of Mary, queen of Scots, early in 1585 Reynoldes entered his service, perhaps at the suggestion of Sir Francis Walsingham, whose secretaries included Lake and Francis Mills, a Southampton man and former fellow of All Souls, and to whom Reynoldes had a connection through his kinship with Lady Walsingham's family, the St Barbs. He remained in Paulet's service until after Mary's execution in February 1587. It is possible that during Mary's imprisonment at Chartley, Reynoldes became known to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, whose estate it was. By mid-1588 he had become Essex's man, acting as junior colleague to the earl's secretary, Thomas Smith. He accompanied Essex on the Portugal expedition in 1589 and during the Rouen campaign of 1591. When Smith became clerk of the privy council in mid 1595 Reynoldes became Essex's &#145;chief confident [personal] secretary&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 286, fol. 258<i>v</i>). The appointment of three new secretaries meant that when Essex went on campaign in 1596, 1597, and 1599, Reynoldes remained at Essex House to act as the earl's man of business around the court and the City. However, the prospect of a fourth new appointment to Essex's secretariat (which Reynoldes regarded as a discredit to himself) upset him so greatly that in August 1596 he offered to resign. This additional appointment was abandoned, but he still found himself at odds with one of his new colleagues, Henry Wotton. Reynoldes responded by strengthening his ties with Anthony Bacon, Essex's friend and chief intelligence co-ordinator, himself on poor terms with Wotton.<br>
<br>Compounding Reynoldes's woes in 1596 was the behaviour of his brother Augustine, who misappropriated money which he had collected at Southampton for Essex's impost on sweet wines. Reynoldes was apparently forced to take over his brother's collectorship for the next few years and repay the debt. He had for some time been pursuing office on his own account. By 1597 his chief target was the reversion of a clerkship of the privy seal; with support from Essex, Bacon, and Sir Robert Cecil this was finally granted on 26 June 1598. Essex's attempts to have Reynoldes elected MP for Stafford in 1593 had failed, but in 1597 he was elected MP for Andover, where Essex was high steward. Over this period, possibly already a widower, he had also been conducting a long-distance courtship of Katherine, widow of one John Mills, who owned property in Southampton. After long delays Reynoldes seems to have married her in 1599.<br>
<br>Reynoldes remained in Essex's service after the earl's fall from grace in late 1599. In contrast to other servants like Henry Cuffe and Sir Gelly Meyrick, who increasingly saw force as the only way by which Essex could recover his fortunes, Reynoldes argued that Essex could only &#145;drawe himself out of this bogg&#146; by &#145;humble &amp; temperat&#146; conduct  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/273/38). Several letters from Essex to the queen in 1600 survive in his hand. However, these are copies rather than drafts and provide no evidence that he had a role in their composition. Reynoldes was arrested after Essex's insurrection in London on 8 February 1601, but it is not clear that he took part in the action. He was soon released without being charged or fined.<br>
<br>Although he won election as MP for Weymouth later that year Reynoldes's prospects were hamstrung by the fall of Essex. He spent much of the next few years living at Salisbury or Whiteparish in Wiltshire and was often sick. His wife also suffered chronic ill health and was dead by June 1605. He sustained himself as a moneylender, which caused him great frustrations and forced him to rely heavily upon his brother Owen, a servant of his old colleague Thomas Smith. After years of failed attempts to buy out Thomas Kerry from his clerkship of the privy seal, Reynoldes finally entered the office in mid-1608. Almost immediately he was plunged into an awkward dispute about fees with the lord privy seal, Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, who had been a friend of Essex and whom Reynoldes regarded as a patron. However, his much delayed entry into the privy seal office also made him a close colleague of his old friend Francis Mills. When Mills died in September 1618 Reynoldes succeeded him as registrar of the court of requests. Following the death of his favourite brother, Owen (who had become keeper of the privy council chest), in April 1610, Reynoldes increasingly invested his hopes of family success in his cousin John Castle, who served as clerk to Levinus Munck, the assistant secretary of state. He ultimately succeeded in establishing Castle as his successor in the privy seal office. Despite his abiding dislike of his brother Augustine, Reynoldes also took a direct interest in Augustine's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23408/', "Edward Reynolds")</script> (1599&#150;1676, the future bishop of Norwich), whom he sent to Merton College, Oxford, where his old friend and fellow Essexian Henry Savile was provost. In his will of June 1623 Reynoldes named his nephew and namesake as one of his executors. Lacking any children of his own, he specified generous bequests to many members of his extended family. He also left &pound;20 for the schoolmaster of Southampton grammar school and &pound;20 to buy divinity books for All Souls. He died either in late November or early December, or on 18 December, 1623 and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
