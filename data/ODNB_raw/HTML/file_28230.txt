<span class="headword">Verney, Sir  Francis</span>  (1584&#150;1615), <span class="occ">pirate</span>, was the elder son of Edmund Verney (1535&#150;1600) of Penley, Hertfordshire, and Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire, who was knighted in 1597 or 1598. Sir Edmund's first marriage had been childless and Francis's mother was his second wife, Audrey (1543&#150;1588), daughter of William Gardner of Fulham and widow of Sir Peter Carew the younger. Shortly after her death Edmund Verney married Mary, daughter of William Blakeney of Sparham, Norfolk, and widow in turn of Geoffrey Turville of New Hall Park, Leicestershire, and William St Barbe of Ashington, Somerset. His father's remarriage had a radical effect on Francis Verney's future. It gave him a half-brother&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28228/', "Edmund Verney (1590&#150;1642)")</script>, later famous as Charles I's standard-bearer slain at Edgehill&#151;and in 1597 or 1598  (39 Elizabeth) their father obtained an act of parliament to divide his estates almost equally between his two sons and protect his widow's life interest in his estates. His father's remarriage also gave Francis a wife: in June 1599 he was married to Ursula St Barbe (1585&#150;1668), his stepmother's daughter from her second marriage. The children were fourteen and twelve respectively, only just above the minimum legal age for marriage.<br>
<br>Verney matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, aged fifteen, on 19 September 1600 and four years later, on 14 March 1604, he was knighted at the Tower of London. By then he was living in St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, where one of his servants was killed in a brawl. Verney was running up debts, and his uncle sought permission on his behalf from Robert Cecil to cut down timber to help pay off his creditors. However, when Francis himself made a similar request in March 1605 to &#145;fell certain timber growing upon his own land, which he might fell when he came to full age&#146; his motive was not merely &#145;for the discharge of divers gentlemen that stood engaged&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 17.115). Rather he was directly challenging the provision made by his father for his stepmother and younger half-brother at his expense. Lady Verney immediately complained that Francis had used Cecil's permission as a warrant to intrude on her jointure, carrying off her wood and destroying the rabbit warrens which she had leased out. The following year Francis took his campaign to parliament and in March 1606 sought to get the act of <span class="roman">39 Elizabeth</span> overturned. The matter was quickly thrown out by the Commons: members could remember Sir Edmund's great efforts to get it passed and if it fell too many buyers' property rights would be at risk. Unhappily married and pursued by his creditors Francis Verney sold off his estates in the course of 1607 and 1608. During this period he journeyed to Jerusalem and back, where he acquired a pilgrim's staff inlaid with crosses.<br>
<br>By the end of 1608 Verney had left England for good. By the autumn of 1609 he was at Tunis: on 19 November the Venetian ambassador in London reported that the Levant Company was arming its Mediterranean ships against corsairs, &#145;who have recently been joined by a certain Francis Verney, an Englishman of very noble blood who has gone through a fortune of four thousand crowns a year&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1607&#150;10</i>, 386). A week later an Englishman in Madrid reported to a compatriot in Brussels that Verney had turned pirate. In May 1610 the Venetian ambassador reported again that some Venetian ships had been captured and their crew &#145;taken as slaves to Barbary&#146;. Upon their release the sailors reported that Verney had lost some of his ships and that he was &#145;in great poverty and deeply in debt to the Turks&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1607&#150;10</i>, 481). In December the ambassador wrote that Verney was working closely with the pirate John Ward, that both had converted to Islam (as Arabic sources confirm about the latter), and that they had recently captured two ships sailing from Lisbon to Italy.<br>
<br>It is quite likely that Verney continued in his piracy until he was captured by a Sicilian galley. According to the Scottish traveller William Lithgow he was enslaved for two years, after which he was &#145;redeemed by an English Jesuit upon a promise of his conversion to the Christian faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rare Adventurs</span>, 228). On 25 August 1615 Verney entered the hospital of St Mary of Pity in Messina, Sicily, but died ten days later on 6 September 1615. He was buried by Lithgow who bewailed &#145;sorrowfully the miserable mutability of fortune, who from so great a birth had given him so mean a fortune&#146;  (ibid.). John Watchin, an English merchant, brought home to England relics of Verney's life in the Mediterranean: the pilgrim's staff, a purple Turkish robe, a turban, two pairs of Turkish slippers, and an enamelled ring. These are still kept at Claydon House, where there is also a fine portrait of Verney as a fashionable Jacobean gentleman. His widow was married again in 1619, to William Clark of Hitcham, Buckinghamshire, this time directly against the wishes of the groom's father. The tradition of the Verney family&#151;the family of his half-brother Edmund&#151;remembered Francis as &#145;a great traveller&#146; who &#145;fought several Duellos&#146;  (Verney, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, rev. edn, 1.48).<br>
