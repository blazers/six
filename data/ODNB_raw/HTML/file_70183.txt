<span class="headword">Patterson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Caffyn]</span>,  Sheila</span>  (1918&#150;1998), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born on 30 March 1918 at 64 Bower Mount Road, Maidstone, Kent, the daughter of Thomas Percy Caffyn (1871/2&#150;1920), master draper, and his wife, Edith, daughter of Jason Saville, engineer. Her father had been ill for several years before her birth, and died when she was two. On 19 September 1928 her mother married Malcolm Kenneth Pridmore, solicitor, of Cromers Close, Kenilworth Road, Coventry. Sheila Pridmore, as she became, was educated at Roedean School and at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she obtained a third class in classical moderations in 1938 and a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1940. She joined the War Office as a temporary civil servant in October 1940, but in 1941 became assistant secretary at Polish House, London, which came under the direction of the British Council. On 6 May 1944 she married Captain Zdzislaw Gadomski (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), an officer with the general staff of the Polish army. The marriage ended shortly thereafter, but she retained a keen interest in Poland and its &eacute;migr&eacute; communities.<br>
<br>In 1947 Sheila Gadomski enrolled for a postgraduate diploma in social anthropology at the London School of Economics, and undertook research in South Africa. She was awarded the diploma in 1950 for her thesis, &#145;The status of the Cape Coloured people within the South African social structure&#146;. Her research in South Africa led to two books, <span class="italic">Colour and Culture in South Africa</span> (1953) and a history of the Afrikaners, <span class="italic">The Last Trek</span> (1957), and to a lasting friendship with Ellen Hellman, a founder of the South African Institute of Race Relations. On 23 January 1948 she married Captain Bruce Tyrrell Patterson (<i>d</i>. 2000), with whom she had one daughter, (Anne) Clarissa (1953&#150;1973). The marriage was again short-lived, and she returned to Britain in 1954, after two years' research among the Polish community in Canada. On 7 May 1955 she married, lastly, Tadeusz Horko, a Polish journalist, but she retained the name Sheila Patterson for professional purposes.<br>
<br>Between 1955 and 1959 Patterson undertook the research among West Indian settlers in Brixton, south London, which led to her best-known book, <span class="italic">Dark Strangers</span> (1959). This was a descriptive study based on the assumption that the settlers would eventually be assimilated into the general population. It was followed by a volume that earned her a London PhD in social anthropology, <span class="italic">Immigrants in Industry</span> (1968), which derived from research conducted in Croydon in 1959&#150;60. In 1958 she had begun working for the Institute of Race Relations in London, a recent offshoot of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. From 1960 she edited the institute's newsletter, a factual record of events that included an occasional commentary. This work was later built into a book-length chronicle under her authorship, <span class="italic">Immigration and Race Relations in Britain, 1960&#150;1967</span> (1969). Following a break in 1968&#150;70 for research in Barbados and St Vincent, she was from 1971 for sixteen years editor of <span class="italic">New Community</span>, the quarterly journal of the Community Relations Commission (a body which later became the Commission for Racial Equality).<br>
<br>From the mid-1950s to the end of the 1960s public discussion of the issues posed by new Commonwealth immigration into Britain was led by a group disparaged by one critic as &#145;the lords and ladies of race relations&#146;. Patterson might have been one of them. She had returned to Britain as a strikingly attractive and elegant woman with a cut-glass accent. Her sometimes imperious manner concealed a basic shyness: someone who worked closely with her in the 1970s testified that &#145;she declined more public speaking invitations than anyone I have ever known&#146;  (private information). The end of the era of the lords and ladies was foretold in 1967, when a very successful white-led pressure group, the Campaign against Racial Discrimination, was taken over by black militants. In 1972 the Institute of Race Relations was the subject of a take-over that gave it a radically leftist character. The Community Relations Commission, established under the <span class="roman">Race Relations Act 1968</span> to promote harmonious community relations, occupied a central position in a very contested field. <span class="italic">New Community</span> set out to bridge the gaps between academics, those working in the applied field, and policy-makers, by publishing a wide range of research findings in a jargon-free style. Patterson was an excellent choice as editor, for she observed strict standards of accuracy in reporting, in the selection of appropriate names for groups and social processes, and in political impartiality. Though many of those around her were left-wingers, she was ready to tell them that she herself was a Conservative with a capital C. She and her husband had a flat in Nerja, Andalusia, Spain, where everything appealed to her: the warmth, the way of life, the food, and above all the people.<br>
<br>The 1970s were also a decade of change in social anthropology, with the passing of a generation of scholars who had conducted field research in the colonial era and had focused on the study of social structure. Interest switched to new fields and new theories. Patterson did not contribute to the change of direction, or, indeed, follow it very closely. She had by this time come to concentrate upon the study of race relations within the Commonwealth and to develop an approach that had more in common with that of a historian than of a social theorist.<br>
<br>Patterson retired as editor of <span class="italic">New Community</span> in 1987, though she maintained contact with her former colleagues in Britain and elsewhere. Her last years were spent at the Victoria Highgrove Nursing Home, 59 Dyke Road Avenue, Hove, Sussex, and she died there on 21 June 1998, following a stroke. Her husband Tadeusz Horko predeceased her.<br>
