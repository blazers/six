<span class="headword">Hart,  Francis Dudley <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1909&#150;2004), <span class="occ">rheumatologist</span>, was born on 4 October 1909 at The Vicarage, Glossop, Derbyshire, the son of Charles Dudley Hart, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Kate Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowden. He was educated at Grosvenor School, Nottingham. Intending to become a clergyman, like his father and grandfather, he entered the University of Edinburgh to read theology, but after two years he switched to medicine, graduating MB ChB in 1933 and MD in 1939 and being admitted MRCP in 1937. After a spell as junior registrar at the Royal Northern Hospital, London (1935&#150;7), and house physician and clinical assistant at the Brompton Hospital (1937&#150;9), he became a registrar at the Westminster Hospital in 1939.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War the patients, students, and most of the staff at the Westminster were evacuated, leaving Hart and three surgeons to run the hospital as a casualty clearing station, including during the blitz. In 1942 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in Iraq, north Africa, and Italy. He was mentioned in dispatches and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1944 he married Mary Josephine Tully (<i>d</i>. 2002), daughter of Luke Tully, of Carrigaline, co. Cork; they had a son, Paul, and two daughters, Clare and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Hart's interest in the rheumatic diseases (then little understood but often devastating in their effects) began in the 1930s, and one of his earliest articles, published in 1939, was a study of rheumatic fever in children. During the war he made a study of ankylosing spondylitis, or &#145;poker back disease&#146;, which he found to be surprisingly common in army recruits.<br>
<br>On his return to the Westminster Hospital in 1946 as consultant physician in general medicine Hart was able to develop his interest in the rheumatic diseases, establishing the first specialist rheumatology clinic in a London teaching hospital. His subsequent contributions to the identification and treatment of rheumatic diseases and to the burgeoning discipline of rheumatology were manifold. He was among the earliest to argue coherently that ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are two different diseases, and that a propensity to ankylosing spondylitis is inherited (a hypothesis later confirmed by David James and Derrick Brewerton, working in Hart's unit, who identified a link between the inherited tissue type HLA B27 and ankylosing spondylitis). He was also an early and forceful opponent of the treatment, then common, of ankylosing spondylitis by plaster casts, which he showed to be positively harmful. He directed research into the treatment as well as the classification of rheumatic diseases. He published a number of seminal articles on the clinical pharmacology of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly with E. C. (Ted) Huskisson. As chairman of the Royal College of Physicians' committee on rheumatology in 1952 (he had been elected FRCP three years earlier) he was instrumental in the recognition of rheumatology as a separate medical specialism, and he was later closely involved in the founding of the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, attached to the Charing Cross Hospital. He served for many years on the executive committee of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council (later the Arthritis Research Campaign).<br>
<br>Hart published some two hundred scientific papers, and wrote, edited, or contributed to some twenty medical textbooks. He also wrote for the general public, most notably <span class="italic">Overcoming Arthritis</span> (1981) and a regular column, until 1998, for <span class="italic">Arthritis Today</span>, the Arthritis Research Campaign's quarterly magazine. Latterly he was interested in the history of rheumatology. A talented musician (reputed to be able to play fifteen different instruments to a high standard), and a lover of jazz and swing, he recorded his own &#145;Rheumatological Song Cycle&#146; by means of synchronized tape recordings. A kindly doctor who treated his patients with respect, he was an outstanding teacher who kept in touch with an ever expanding network of former colleagues and students by means of &#145;little notes of encouragement and congratulation sent when a paper was published or a career advancement was made &hellip; [which] he kept sending &hellip; well into his nineties&#146;  (Sturrock, 1461). He retired from the Westminster Hospital at the statutory retirement age in 1974 but continued in private practice in Harley Street (and writing or reviewing for scientific journals) until shortly before his death, at his old hospital, the renamed Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, on 10 April 2004, of cancer of the pancreas. He was survived by his three children.<br>
