<span class="headword">Lovekyn,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1368), <span class="occ">merchant and lord mayor of London</span>, was descended from an ancient Surrey family. The sources variously describe him as the son of Edward Lovekyn, citizen of London, and a native of Kingston, who built a chapel in that parish in 1309, and of Edward's brother, Robert, who left lands and rents for the endowment there of various family obits. John is described in letters patent of 26 Edward III as the son of Edward, but in the register of Bishop Stratford as the son and heir of Robert. The former seems more likely to have been his father. He re-endowed the family chapel in 1352 with two messuages in the parish of St Michael, Crooked Lane, of the annual value of &pound;4.<br>
<br>A wealthy man, recorded at different times as a stockfishmonger, pepperer, and draper, John Lovekyn carried on an extensive merchandise in salted or stockfish, corn, wheat, oats, beans, herrings, and sea coal, and traded much abroad. In 1358 he claimed as a citizen of London the right to bring a freight of sea coal from Newcastle to London free of custom. In 1360 he supplied provisions to the royal army in Normandy, and in 1365 he successfully protested through the mayor and aldermen to the authorities of Nieuport in Flanders against the seizure of a cargo of red herrings which he and his agents at Great Yarmouth were importing to London. Lovekyn first lived in the parish of St Mary-at-Hill, in a house afterwards occupied by his &#145;servant&#146; and apprentice, Sir William Walworth. Early in Edward III's reign he moved to the parish of St Michael, Crooked Lane, where his large mansion in Thames Street overlooked the river between Oystergate and Ebbegate by the bridge foot. He brought with him his fellow tradesmen, and the locality became known as Stockfishmongers' Row. His mansion descended to Walworth, and afterwards to Henry Preston, citizen and stockfishmonger, who left it in 1434 to the Fishmongers' Company for their hall.<br>
<br>Lovekyn was alderman of Bridge ward, became sheriff in 1342, and was one of the representatives of the city in parliament in 1344, 1346, 1348, and 1365. He was four times lord mayor, in 1348, 1358, 1365, and 1366. He owed his third tenure of office to the direct appointment of the king on 21 January 1365, in place of Adam Bury, who was discharged by a royal order, although he had been re-elected after serving as mayor in the previous year. He also held numerous other civic offices, including city attorney at Boston fair, in Lincolnshire (1333), warden of London Bridge (1342&#150;50), auditor of the bridge accounts (1351), and supervisor of the city's supply of ships to the royal fleet (1359). Leader of the Fishmongers in 1351, he had contributed to a gift by the city to the king in 1337, and to London's loans to the crown in 1340 and 1346. He lent sums ranging from &pound;100 to &pound;200 to the king between 1356 and 1365.<br>
<br>In 1338 Lovekyn went overseas in the king's service, and later held royal appointments in Surrey. He stood surety for Adam Fraunceys, mercer and citizen of London, as guardian of Simon, son of Thomas Leggy, skinner, and he benefited his ancestral home at Kingston by repairing his father's chapel and making further endowments. He was also the second founder of the church of St Michael, Crooked Lane, which he entirely rebuilt at his own cost. According to Leland, he founded St Michael's College, in connection with the church. John Stow says that Walworth was the founder, &#145;peradventure for John Lofkin his master&#146;  (Herbert, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities</span>, 125).<br>
<br>Lovekyn was married twice: first to Mabel, who brought him a stepdaughter, Leticia, and then to Margaret. He died on 4 August 1368 and was buried in the choir of St Michael, Crooked Lane, under a handsome tomb, with images of himself and his first wife in alabaster. Stow relates that Lovekyn's monument was removed, and a flat stone of grey marble, garnished with plates of copper, substituted. The brass plate containing his epitaph in three Latin verses found its way to Walkern church, Hertfordshire, where it served as a palimpsest brass inside the church for Richard Humberstone, who died in 1581. Both Lovekyn's and Walworth's monuments were restored by the Fishmongers' Company in 1562, with the addition of an English inscription in doggerel verse. In the original Latin inscription Lovekyn is erroneously said to have died in 1370. His will, dated 25 July 1368, was enrolled in the court of husting on 11 November 1368. Walworth acted as his executor and later married his widow. He appears to have possessed, besides his house in Thames Street, other houses further east towards Billingsgate, and property in St Martin Vintry, Crooked Lane, Candlewick Street, Oyster Hill, and Tower Street. Lovekyn left no issue, but he bequeathed some London property to a nephew, John.<br>
