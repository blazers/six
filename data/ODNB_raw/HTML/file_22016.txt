<span class="headword">Savoy,  Peter  of</span>, count of Savoy and <i>de facto</i> earl of Richmond  (1203?&#150;1268), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the sixth or seventh son of Thomas (I), count of Savoy (<i>d</i>. 1233), and Marguerite, daughter of Guillaume (I), count of Geneva. He was later said to have been born at his family's castle of Susa in 1203.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinSavoyandEngland"></a>Early career in Savoy and England</h2>As a younger son Peter was intended for a career in the church, and it is as a clerk that he is first recorded, in 1224. By 1226 he was a canon of Lausanne, where in 1229 he was appointed to administer the vacant see, probably in the unfulfilled expectation of his being elected bishop. By 1233 he was probably contemplating the abandonment of his clerical career, for through the agency of his brother William, bishop of Valence, he was then betrothed to Agn&egrave;s (<i>d</i>. 1268), the second daughter of Aymon (II), lord of Faucigny, with the promise of all the Faucigny lands except those already assigned to an elder sister. The marriage took place in 1238. This represented a major expansion of Savoyard influence to the south of Lake Geneva. Peter's attempts to establish a new power base in the western Alps, combined with an aggressive policy towards the neighbouring lords of Geneva, led to a bitter war, and in the winter of 1236&#150;7 Peter was ambushed and briefly taken prisoner. But with family assistance the count of Geneva was worsted, and forced to promise the surrender of various castles and an indemnity of 20,000 marks. In 1237, following the death of his brother Amon, Peter succeeded to an apanage in the Chablais and the Valais, which in turn led to a fierce struggle against the pope and the local ecclesiastical authorities. This dispute may have contributed to the decision of Peter and his brothers to welcome the emperor, Frederick II, to Turin in 1238, and from there to assist in the imperial campaign of reconquest in Lombardy.<br>
<br>By this time the Savoyard ruling family had already obtained an unprecedented position in international affairs, not least through the marriage of Peter's niece Marguerite to Louis IX of France in 1234, followed in 1236 by the marriage of another niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8620/', "Eleanor")</script>, to Henry III of England. Various of Peter's kinsmen, including his brothers William and Thomas, count of Flanders from 1237, had already established contacts with the English court, and it was in an attempt to emulate their success that Peter himself sought a meeting with Henry III. In 1240, following a brutal armed assault upon the city of Lausanne which failed to secure the election of his brother Philippe as bishop, Peter made his way to England, where he arrived about Christmas. Thereafter, for the remainder of his life, he was to divide his time and his energies equally between his estates in Savoy and a new-found position at the English court. In England he was afforded an extravagant welcome, and was knighted by the king at Westminster on 5 January 1241. Shortly afterwards his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2844/', "Boniface of Savoy")</script>, was elected archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>In May 1241 Peter was granted the lordship of Richmond in Yorkshire. He appears as a member of the king's council, hearing legal disputes from May 1241, and in September 1241 was granted custody of the heir and lands of William (V) de Warenne, earl of Surrey, and of the castles of Lewes, Pevensey, and Canterbury. This was rapidly followed by custody of Rochester Castle and the Cinque Ports. Native resentment against his promotion was smoothed by Peter's undertaking to surrender Dover, Rochester, and Canterbury castles, and in January 1242 it was Peter who delivered the king's offer of concessions to the barons assembled in parliament. In the same month he received the Sussex honour of Aigle, together with Pevensey Castle, in custody for the next ten years, subsequently transformed into a hereditary fief. Throughout his time in England he appears deliberately to have refrained from claiming the title of earl, describing himself merely as lord of Richmond, perhaps as a sop to baronial opinion.<h2>
<a name="Consolidationintwocountries"></a>Consolidation in two countries</h2>Peter returned to the continent from June until September 1241, on a mission from Henry III to the barons of Burgundy, and was in Savoy again by December 1241, perhaps to recruit supporters for Henry III's forthcoming campaign in Poitou. In the meantime his previously tense relations with the king's brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall, were eased by Richard's decision to marry yet another of Peter's nieces, Sanchia of Provence, sister of Queen Marguerite and Queen Eleanor. In February 1242, to prepare for the arrival of the English expeditionary force, Peter was sent to Poitou, where he narrowly escaped ambush. He travelled on to Provence, finalizing the arrangements for the marriage of Richard of Cornwall. From Provence he made his way to Savoy, where he resumed the military struggle against Geneva that was to preoccupy him for the next ten years; he secured the strategic lordships of Arlod and Gruy&egrave;re, and in December 1242 obtained more favourable terms from a marriage negotiated earlier between his daughter B&eacute;atrice and Guiges (VII), <i>dauphin</i> of the neighbouring province of the Viennois. By the summer of 1244, through a combination of military threats, diplomacy, and purchase, he had effectively imposed his lordship over the entire Pays de Vaud.<br>
<br>Peter then returned to England, where in July 1244 he served as royal spokesman to the clergy in parliament, and in the following year led a major contingent against the Welsh. In February 1246 he was granted a house in the Strand outside London, the origins of the Savoy Palace and, later, the hotel. Having returned briefly to his homeland, in February 1247 he was back in England, bringing with him two Savoyard heiresses, married to Edmund de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and to Richard, son of the late Hubert de Burgh, one-time earl of Kent, marriages that are said to have bred discontent among the native English baronage. Throughout this period Peter's income from his English estates, together with loans from Richard of Cornwall, served to fund yet further additions to his lordship in Savoy, where in 1248 he was able to purchase the fortified town of Vevey. In October 1249, while still abroad, he was appointed to treat with Louis IX for an extension of the Anglo-French truce, and in the same month was granted custody of Rye Castle and the honour and castle of Hastings, formerly held by the counts of Eu. In 1250 he once again set out for Savoy, <i>en route</i> negotiating a further prolongation of the truce with France. While overseas he successfully put down an outbreak of resistance from the lord of La Tour-du-Pin and from his principal rivals, the house of Geneva, obtaining custody of half a dozen of the count of Geneva's most strategically important castles, in theory pending the payment of an indemnity of 10,000 marks, in practice for life.<br>
<br>Peter then returned to England briefly in March 1251, and then became intimately involved in the negotiations for Simon de Montfort's withdrawal from Gascony and in the decision to award the duchy to the Lord Edward, Peter's nephew, rather than to Richard of Cornwall. Throughout this process he served as a staunch supporter of Simon de Montfort, helping to smooth the anger of the king. In August 1251, with his father-in-law on the point of death, he was officially invested with the lordship of Faucigny, used thereafter to tighten his grip over the entire Pays de Vaud as far north as Fribourg and Bern. This process culminated in 1255 in a request from the citizens of Bern and Morat that Peter act as their protector, followed by Peter's award of charters to the two cities, saving whatever loyalty they might owe to the emperor as overlord. In this way, in little more than a decade, backed by the financial resources made available to him from England, Peter had effectively annexed the whole of western Switzerland as a Savoyard fief.<h2>
<a name="Royalcounselloranddiplomat"></a>Royal counsellor and diplomat</h2>Meanwhile, during one of his occasional visits to England, in November 1252 Peter was appointed keeper of the honour and castle of Tickhill during the Lord Edward's minority, and in the same month became embroiled in the dispute between his brother, Archbishop Boniface of Savoy, and Aymer de Lusignan, bishop-elect of Winchester, that was to escalate into a full-scale factional struggle between the king's Savoyard and Poitevin&#150;Lusignan kinsmen. In the following year he took the cross, being promised the enormous sum of 10,000 marks towards the expenses of his proposed crusade, and receiving a substantial advance payment of 5500 marks in cash so that he might settle his affairs in Savoy. This was accompanied by the award of various lands and wardships, including custody of William de Vescy, who was to be married to a Savoyard heiress at the discretion of Peter and Queen Eleanor.<br>
<br>In July 1253 Peter took charge of various charters relating to the Lord Edward's lands and to the appointment of Eleanor as regent in the event of the king's death, and in the following month accompanied Henry III's expedition to Gascony. There, over the next year, he served as a leading diplomatic adviser, closely involved in the negotiations for the marriage of the Lord Edward to Eleanor of Castile, and in the king's bid for Sicily, intended as a portion for Henry III's younger son, Edmund. Having spent much of 1255 in the Alps, completing his conquest of Bern, by November 1255 he was back in England, passing <i>en route</i> through Gascony to give counsel to the Lord Edward. In the following year he was once again appointed to negotiate with Louis IX of France, and thereafter, no doubt because of his experience in papal and imperial politics, was asked to join in discussions over &#145;the Sicilian business&#146;.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1256 Peter was once again in Savoy, besieging the cities of Turin and Asti whose citizens had in the previous year captured and attempted to ransom his brother Thomas, since 1253 recognized as count of Savoy. He did not return to England until November 1256, at which time the king issued a notorious order, forbidding any writ prejudicial to Peter to be issued by the chancery. In January 1257 he was sent overseas, probably to negotiate the release of his brother Thomas. He was back in England by April 1257, and in the following month, acting together with Queen Eleanor, purchased the wardship of the heir to the Ferrers earldom of Derby, for 6000 marks paid to the Lord Edward. Thereafter he continued to play a part in negotiations over Sicily, and in June 1257, together with Simon de Montfort, travelled to Paris for discussions with the French.<h2>
<a name="Involvementinthebaronswars"></a>Involvement in the barons' wars</h2>With the outbreak of baronial rebellion in the spring of 1258, far from being proscribed by the English barons, Peter joined his other Savoyard kinsmen in a sworn conspiracy against Henry III's Lusignan half-brothers, and in May 1258, at Paris, sealed a provisional draft of the peace treaty with France. In August he advised the barons on their negotiations with the papacy over Sicily, and was sent north, to Scotland, in an effort to prevent disturbances on the northern march. He was subsequently appointed to the council of fifteen that was set to oversee reform. In January 1259 he was sent by the baronial council to greet Richard of Cornwall on his return from Germany, in an attempt to reconcile Richard to the programme of baronial reform. That summer he was in France for the final settlement of Anglo-French disputes under the treaty of Paris. Over the next few months he appears to have crossed and recrossed from France to England on at least two occasions.<br>
<br>By this time Peter had become disenchanted with Simon de Montfort, over Montfort's attempts to exploit the negotiation of the Anglo-French treaty for private interest. As a result he faced attempts by Montfort to secure his removal from the council. In February 1260 he once again set out for Savoy, where, in his absence, his local representatives had continued to make territorial gains at the expense of the neighbouring lords of Geneva and Sion. In 1260 Peter led a successful campaign against the castle of Charousse, obtained various new lordships through pressure placed upon the bishop of Sion, and began the fortification of various outposts in the region of Bern. These had been conceded to him by Richard of Cornwall as king of the Romans in the previous year, and included the lordship of Yverdon on Lake Neuch&acirc;tel, where Peter set about the building of a castle. He did not return to England until November 1260, when he rejoined the royalist campaign to suppress baronial reforms, perhaps at least in part because baronial inquiries had threatened various of Peter's own interests in Sussex.<br>
<br>In March 1262 Peter received royal licence to demise Richmond freely after his death, and in June he agreed an exchange with the Lord Edward, surrendering his estates in East Anglia in return for Edward's lordship of Hastings. In July 1262 he accompanied the king to France. He seems to have travelled on to Savoy, where he is to be found in June 1263 at the time of his recognition as count of Savoy in succession to his nephew Boniface, the son of his eldest brother, Amadeus. In the process he effectively usurped the rights of his other nephews, the sons of his brother Thomas, who had been promised the succession to Savoy, but whose military power was no match for Peter's. Thereafter, although he returned briefly to England in November 1263, Peter was increasingly preoccupied with his alpine lordship. During his absence in 1263&#150;4 his English lands were attacked in the opening stages of the baronial revolt led by Simon de Montfort. Peter remained an exile from England throughout the ensuing civil war, although for at least part of this time he is to be found in attendance upon Queen Eleanor in northern France, engaged in attempts to raise money and military support for the king. Since 1259 he had faced the threat that the honour of Richmond would be permanently wrested from him and conferred upon its rightful heir, John of Brittany, who had been reconciled to Henry III under the terms of the Anglo-French peace of 1259.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsachievement"></a>Last years: achievement</h2>With the baronial defeat at Evesham in 1265 Peter's lands were restored, but in May 1266 Richmond was once again seized and conferred upon John of Brittany. Peter himself seems never to have abandoned his claim and he continued to grant charters conferring parts of the Richmond estate, although he made no certain return to England after 1263. From 1265 he was engaged in warfare against Rudolf von Habsburg in the Alps, ended by a treaty negotiated at L&ouml;wenburg on 8 September 1267. In May 1268 he drew up a final version of his will, and he died at Pierre-Ch&acirc;tel on 16 or 17 May after a long illness. He was buried in the family abbey of Hautecombe on 18 May 1268. He willed his estates at Faucigny, together with detached portions of the ancestral Savoyard lands, to his only daughter, B&eacute;atrice, <i>dauphine</i> of Viennois, and his English estates to the sons of Thomas of Savoy, with the exception of the Savoy Palace which he conferred upon the monks of the Grand-St Bernard, and Richmond, which Peter intended for Queen Eleanor. In practice, Eleanor and the Lord Edward proved the principal beneficiaries of his entire English estate. He was succeeded as count of Savoy by his younger brother Philip (<i>d</i>. 1285). Peter's widow, Agn&egrave;s, died shortly after him on 11 August 1268.<br>
<br>From 1240 onwards Peter had shuttled ceaselessly between England and Savoy. However, it was Savoy that appears to have remained closest to his heart. In England he made only a handful of awards to the religious, for the most part simple confirmations of land, although he did attempt to relocate and rebuild the chapel of Pevensey Castle. By contrast, in Savoy he was a generous monastic patron, and it was Savoyards who headed his household, even for his English estates. His principal achievement lay in the conquest of western Switzerland, ensuring that ever afterwards French rather than German would be the language of the western Swiss cantons. The administrative reforms that he instituted there, modelled in part upon the highly centralized government that he and his officials had observed in England, did much to lay the foundations of the later Swiss state. It was Peter who established a fixed financial office at Chamb&eacute;ry, and who, by means of a series of statutes enacted after 1263, transformed the administration of law and justice. Here, ironically, he may well have learned from the reforms attempted by Simon de Montfort and the other baronial rebels against Henry III. In England he is best remembered for his part in the early promotion of the Lord Edward, for his status as a property owner, and in particular for his acquisition and the consequent renaming of the future Savoy Hotel. Although an alien, and therefore suspect to the native English baronage, his activities in 1258&#150;9 serve as a reminder that the baronial rebellion of those years was directed more against the narrow clique of the Lusignans, than against the aliens <i>en masse</i>.<br>
