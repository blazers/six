<span class="headword">Desborough <span class="st"> [Disbrowe]</span>,  Samuel</span>  (1619&#150;1690), <span class="occ">politician and administrator</span>, was born in November 1619 at Eltisley, Cambridgeshire, probably at the Old House, built in 1612 on the site of the rectory for his father, James Desborough, or Disbrowe (1582&#150;1638), landowner and lord of the manor of Eltisley, and his wife, Elizabeth Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1628/9). Samuel seems not to have attended university or the inns of court. He developed strongly puritan religious views, and it was probably these which led him to emigrate to America.<br>
<br>After arriving at New Haven in July 1639, Desborough was one of the founders of Guilford, Connecticut. Despite his youth, he was named as one of the seven pillars of the Independent church there on 19 April 1643. On 27 October 1646 he was chosen magistrate for Guilford for the following year, and he became a leading figure in the settlement. In October 1649 he was chosen as one of the arbitrators in a boundary dispute between New Haven and Totoket. At an unknown date he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1654), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29303/', "Henry Whitfield")</script> of Ockley, Surrey, the first minister of Guilford, who too had emigrated to New Haven in 1639. The couple had at least one daughter, Sarah, who died in March 1649, and a son, James, who married Abigail Marsh of St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 9 March 1679, was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in 1688, and died at Stepney Causeway between November 1690 and January 1691.<br>
<br>Desborough was still at Guilford early in November 1650, but returned to England soon afterwards, accompanied by his wife, children, and father-in-law. He quickly obtained state employment, perhaps through the influence of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7542/', "John Disbrowe")</script> or of George Fenwick, a fellow settler in Connecticut who had returned in 1645; both were then colonels in the parliamentary army. About 20 September 1651, before the completion of the conquest of Scotland, it was reported that there had been a &#145;great dispute between the officers and Comm[issioner] Desborow about the ships taken at Dundee. He claimed them in the right of the state, which they denied, and went on in the sale of them&#146;  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Commonwealth</span>, 16). The following month, Desborough accompanied troops to arrest relations of the governor of Bass Island, who were threatened with the sequestration of their estates should the governor continue recalcitrant. By June 1652 Desborough had been made a parliamentary commissioner in Scotland; on 4 June he and his five fellow commissioners issued an order which named themselves and three others as visitors of the universities and schools in Scotland, and promised &#145;in convenient time, to alter and abolish all such lawes in the same, as shall be found inconsistent with the Government of the Commonwealth of England&#146;  (ibid., 44&#150;5). Under an order of 11 November 1652, which placed the revenues of Scotland under military authority, Desborough served as one of the three commissioners for sequestrations, sitting at Leith, a post he continued to hold under the protectorate. His wife having died of smallpox in 1654, in the following year Desborough married Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hobson (1616/17&#150;1699), widow of Samuel Penoyer, merchant of London.<br>
<br>During the protectorate Desborough was also an MP. In 1654 he was returned to Cromwell's parliament at Westminster, in which he sat for Edinburgh. During the elections of 1656 Lord Broghill reported that &#145;I shall engage the interest I have in Mid-Lothian for Mr Disborough&#146;; on 30 August Monck reported his election for that seat  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 5.295). Desborough became increasingly prominent in the administration of Scotland. On 30 March 1655 instructions were issued by Cromwell to nine persons, including Desborough, &#145;appointed his Highness's Council in Scotland, for the government of that nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655</i>, 108). Also in 1655 Desborough was appointed keeper of the great seal of Scotland. The seal appears not to have arrived for many months, for a letter from Broghill dated 25 June 1656 specified that he was now to discontinue the practice of signing his name to orders issued under its authority, and should use the seal instead. The warrant of authority formally vesting the office in him was dated even later, on 16 September 1657. Desborough continued to hold this office during the brief government of Richard Cromwell.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, early in 1656 a new Scottish version of the court of exchequer was set up to deal with forfeited estates, and Desborough was named as one of the presiding judges. But despite its narrowly defined jurisdiction, the court's activities aroused resentment, and by September 1657 Desborough was warning against efforts to expand the authority of what was widely seen as an executive instrument of foreign rule. Revenue commissioners, he thought, should pursue cases through the ordinary civil courts, despite the probability that these might be swayed by pressure from powerful Scottish vested interests. In May 1658 the court of sessions, renamed the commission for the administration of justice, was ordered to set aside time for issues arising from forfeited properties, and as a means to strengthen the authority of the court, Desborough was ordered to sit with the judges. In July 1658 he became their president and sat as chancellor, &#145;haiffing his mace borne befoir him&#146;  (Nicoll, 218).<br>
<br>Desborough's moderation must have met with the approval of George Monck, and they collaborated in efforts to have government sympathizers elected to Richard's parliament at the end of 1658, underestimating the determination of the duke of Argyll to frustrate this goal. Elected for the shire of Edinburgh, Desborough wrote to Monck that, though ill, he intended to make the long journey soon after the new year. Little is known of Desborough's political stance in 1659, but in spring 1660, with the Restoration increasingly certain, he grasped at the opportunity offered by the declaration of Breda and promised unswerving loyalty to Charles II: &#145;I do lay hold of and accept of his majesties grace favour and pardon in the said declaration held forth&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2519, fol. 32). His submission was signed on 21 May and personally witnessed by Monck.<br>
<br>Desborough obtained a full pardon, with restitution of goods and lands, on 12 December 1660. He retired to the manor of Elsworth, Cambridgeshire, purchased from Thomas Wendy in 1655 by trustees acting on his behalf, where he seems to have lived in complete obscurity, abstaining from politics. Pevsner suggests that the manor house there can be dated to the later seventeenth century and was probably built for Samuel Desborough. Desborough died at Elsworth on 10 December 1690 and was buried there. His will, proved on 16 April 1691, indicates great affection for his second wife, who was clearly not on good terms with her stepson James, and made elaborate provisions to ensure that she could enjoy her jointure and an income of &pound;100 a year, measures apparently stemming from suspicion of his son's intentions. The young man, however, seems not to have long outlived his father. Rose died on 4 March 1699, aged eighty-two, and was buried next to her husband.<br>
