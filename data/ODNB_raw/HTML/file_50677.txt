<span class="headword">Gedde <span class="st"> [Geddy]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1647&#150;1697), <span class="occ">apiculturist</span>, was born in St Andrews, Fife, the second son of Michael Geddy, bailie of St Andrews, and Catherine Avery. In 1649, two years into a four-year apprenticeship to William Henderson, writer to the signet, he was appointed steward clerk to the steward of Fife, James Murray, earl of Annandale, a post he retained when John Murray, earl of Atholl, succeeded as steward in 1661. During Charles II's campaign in Scotland in 1650/51 Gedde was clerk to the committee of war. He married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of an Ayr schoolmaster, William Wallace, in 1657. Elected a bailie of Falkland in 1665, Gedde generally resided there until his death.<br>
<br>Gedde's presbyterianism brought him into conflict with the crown after the Restoration. He was reported to the privy council of Scotland for attending field conventicles and entertaining outed ministers, and in 1678 refused to sign assurances to desist. Religious scruples, reflected in the precocious piety of his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55912/', "Emelia Geddie (1665&#150;1681)")</script>, lost him his clerkship. It also undermined ten years litigation with Patrick Telfer, who in 1678 excluded the family from their property in Falkland and felled Gedde's woods, plantations, and nurseries. Telfer defended these actions by maintaining that Gedde was &#145;knowne to be a most seditious persone, disaffected with the government and one who for his principles and practeisses hath been inter commoned severall years&#146;  (Bryden, 205). Gedde refused to sign the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> introduced under James VII which &#145;necessitated him, his wife and family to abandon his native country until King William's accession&#146;  (Mylne, 341). Returning to Falkland, Gedde recovered part of his fortune, having taxable property valued at &pound;330 in 1695. In 1697 his London publisher described him as &#145;an ancient Gentleman of the Scottish Nation&#146;  (Walker, 306).<br>
<br>Gedde's apicultural interests were awakened through observation of wild bees in the royal park at Falkland. In 1672, without acknowledgement, Sir Robert Moray presented to the Royal Society &#145;a bee hive of a peculiar contrivance, sent out of Scotland &hellip; made up of several pieces, to take off one; whereby bees are kept from swarming, by adding a new box for every swarm&#146;  (T. Birch, ed., <span class="italic">The History of the Royal Society of London</span>, 4 vols., 1756&#150;7, 3.60), given wider publicity by Henry Oldenburg in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1673. Gedde travelled to London, claimed credit for design and operating instructions, and applied for fourteen-year monopoly rights, duly granted in 1675. English partners managed the patent, selling licences to regional manufactures who marketed sets of supered hives complete with a bee colony. His book <span class="italic">A New Discourse of an Excellent Method of Bee-Houses and Colonies</span> was published in London in 1675.<br>
<br>In fact, the design for a supered hive with observation windows had been published by Samuel Hartlib during the interregnum and by 1655 such hives, credited to Gloucestershire cleric William Mew with improvements by Christopher Wren, were in use at Wadham College. In retrospect, the originality in Gedde's design lay only in the insertion of a removable frame in each super. This, with honeycomb attached, could be removed causing little disturbance to the colony. Gedde's apicultural protocols ran counter to traditional management of bees in straw skeps. Suggestions of plagiarism, together with the restrictions implicit in the patent, caused further adverse comment. Nevertheless, extended editions of his book were published in 1676, 1677, and 1697. In 1679 the hive design, openly acknowledging Gedde's patent, was central to the bee-keeping book written by Moses Rusden, successfully recommended by John Evelyn for appointment as bee master to Charles II. Gedde's apicultural ideas were further promulgated through the 1721/2 reprinting of his 1675 text as part of a composite work, in turn the source of a German translation published in Leipzig (1727, 1729, 1752, 1755). In the nineteenth century, when the life cycle of <i>Apis mellifera</i> was better understood, the potential of the supered hive with removable frames was fully exploited to actively manage bees and optimize honey harvested.<br>
