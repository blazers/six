<span class="headword">Bickford,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">currier and inventor of the safety fuse</span>, was baptized in Ashburton, Devon, on 23 January 1774, the son of William and Mary Beckford. He was in business as a currier, dressing and colouring tanned leather, first rather unsuccessfully in Truro and later in Tuckingmill near Camborne in Cornwall. He was not involved in any way with the mining that was carried on in the surrounding area, but he was greatly affected by the frequent serious, and often fatal, accidents suffered by the miners through premature blasting explosions.<br>
<br>Gunpowder had been in widespread use in Europe in mining and quarrying since the early seventeenth century, but 200 years later the techniques available for detonating the charges were still very primitive. One method was simply to set fire to a &#145;train&#146; of gunpowder leading to the charge itself, the length of the train corresponding roughly to the time delay before the charge exploded; a later method involved a kind of fuse of goose quills filled with gunpowder. Both methods were dangerously unreliable, even when (and it was not always the case) the greatest care was exercised by the shot-firers.<br>
<br>Bickford was determined to make a safer type of fuse, and although he was no scientist he carried out a series of experiments with many different combinations of materials until, having nearly despaired of ever achieving his goal, he visited a friend in his rope-walk and suddenly hit on the idea of spinning a light rope or cord round a tightly packed central core of gunpowder. The idea was simple, but devising a machine for the manufacture of his &#145;safety fuse&#146; was beyond Bickford himself, so he took into partnership Thomas Davey, a working miner with a talent for solving mechanical problems. The Bickford safety fuse, as patented on 6 September 1831 (no. 6159), consisted of two layers of flax yarn enclosing a central core of gunpowder, the whole being made watertight with varnish or tar. The resulting fuse was much more accurate and consistent in its timing, and had a much better resistance to water and the various kinds of treatment to which it was inevitably subjected in the mines. It raised the level of both safety and productivity and was therefore popular with both miners and management.<br>
<br>Bickford himself fell seriously ill before his fuse could be manufactured in any quantity, and it was only after his death in 1834 that a factory was established at Tuckingmill which continued to make various types of fuse, seldom departing very far from the original specifications, for almost 130 years. Bickford's family, along with those of his partner, Davey, and Davey's son-in-law George Smith, were involved in the management of Bickford, Smith &amp; Co. up to the time of its final closure in 1961.<br>
<br>William Bickford married Susanna Burall in April 1802 at Illogan, Cornwall. They had two sons, baptized in Truro in 1808 and 1809, both called William (presumably the first died). Bickford died in Tuckingmill and was buried there on 7 October 1834.<br>
