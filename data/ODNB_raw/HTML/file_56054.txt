<span class="headword">Villiers <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Stuart]</span>,  Mary</span>, duchess of Lennox and Richmond  (1622&#150;1685), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born at Wallingford House, London, in March 1622, and baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 30 March, the eldest child and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, marquess (later duke) of Buckingham (1592&#150;1628)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Katherine (1603?&#150;1649) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69581/', "MacDonnell, Katherine")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17953/', "Francis Manners, sixth earl of Rutland")</script>. In her childhood Mall (as she was then commonly known) moved in favoured court circles. James I, who was her godfather, allowed her free access to the privy quarters, frequently cuddled her, and called her his &#145;little grandchild&#146;  (Lockyer, 152). Her father's privileged status led to early plans for an arranged marriage. A projected alliance with the heir of the elector palatine having failed, in 1626, as part of Buckingham's political reconciliation with William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, she was betrothed to Pembroke's nephew Charles Herbert, Lord Herbert of Shurland (1619&#150;1636), eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13042/', "Philip Herbert (1584&#150;1650)")</script> (who succeeded his brother to the earldom in 1630) and his first wife, Lady Susan de Vere. On 27 August 1627 her father obtained a patent granting his daughter the dukedom of Buckingham should he die without sons, but the subsequent birth of her two younger brothers voided this. After Buckingham was murdered in 1628, her mother declared herself a Catholic, and Lady Mary's guardianship was entrusted to the Herbert family.<br>
<br>Lady Mary continued to spend much of her time at court, and she participated in masques from 1630. On one occasion she was carried to an unsuspecting Charles I in a hamper, gaining in consequence the nickname Butterfly or Papillon. She married Lord Herbert on 8 January 1635 in the royal closet at Whitehall, an event celebrated in verse by William Davenant and marked by a drama from Henry Killigrew, published in 1638 as <span class="italic">The Conspiracy</span>. Herbert soon left with his younger brother Philip to travel abroad, and in January 1636 died of smallpox in Florence, evoking from Philip Massinger the elegy <span class="italic">Sero, sed serio</span>. On 3 August 1637, bringing with her a dowry of &pound;20,000, Lady Mary was married by Archbishop William Laud at Lambeth to the king's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26707/', "James Stuart, fourth duke of Lennox (1612&#150;1655)")</script> (from 1641 first duke of Richmond), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67529/', "Esm&#233; Stuart, third duke of Lennox")</script>, and Katherine Clifton, Baroness Clifton. The couple had a house at Cobham Hall, Kent, but also remained prominent at court, where the duchess's beauty was celebrated in verse and prose; numerous portraits include several by Anthony Van Dyck.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the civil war Duchess Mary joined the queen in Holland, returning early in 1643. Gossip that she &#145;had used beating up of quarters &hellip; too frequently with Prince Rupert&#146;  (P. Morrah, <span class="italic">Prince Rupert of the Rhine</span>, 1976) points to a romance between the two that year. At a late stage of the war, in April 1646, she obtained a pass to visit London to consult the physician Theodore Mayerne. In July 1648 her brother Lord Francis Villiers was killed in a skirmish, and elegies on his death by Andrew Marvell and others coupled her name with his. On the morning of Charles I's execution, in January 1649, the king found his father's watch which Lady Mary had played with as an infant, and as his last bequest had it sent to her.<br>
<br>Duchess Mary had two children, a son, Esm&eacute;, born in London on 2 November 1649, and a daughter, Mary, born in July 1651. On the death of her husband on 30 March 1655 she found herself in debt and set out for France, where she became involved in royalist intrigues. Her son died in Paris on 10 August 1660, and was buried on 4 September in Westminster Abbey. It was probably at this point that the duchess returned to England. In December de Bartet, a French agent in England, wrote to Cardinal Mazarin, following a visit to her house, that she was the most &#145;rejouissante&#146; (amusing) woman in the world  (TNA: PRO, PRO 31/3/108, fols. 124&#150;5). Although going then to court de Bartet gave Charles II the news that he had just been instrumental in securing Duchess Mary's conversion to Catholicism, the king had responded positively to the agent's request that she be repaid &pound;40,000 jacobus owed her by the crown and had proposed the three meet privately to discuss potential royal brides. In March 1662 she was appointed a lady of the bedchamber to the queen dowager, Henrietta Maria, and on 30 April a privy seal was issued for &pound;20,000 in full repayment of the debts owing to her and to her husband by Charles I, but the following year she was still in financial difficulties. Before 26 November 1664 she married Colonel Thomas Howard (<i>d</i>. 1678), known as Northern Tom Howard, who was lieutenant of the yeomen of the guard and younger brother of Charles Howard, first earl of Carlisle. It seems that she remained in England when Henrietta Maria returned to France in June 1665, and was in London in the spring of 1667 to plead for a pardon for her brother the second duke of Buckingham, then in hiding after political dissidence. She finally departed for France that October. Once there she apparently played a part in the intrigue surrounding negotiations between Charles II and his sister Henriette Anne, duchess of Orl&eacute;ans: French diplomatic correspondence reported in March 1669 that Duchess Mary had told Buckingham (now rehabilitated) of Henrietta Anne's distrust of him in a letter whose diction was &#145;very confused&#146; and &#145;corresponded to the spirit of the lady&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 31/3/121, fols. 70&#150;72). She was still a member of the queen dowager's entourage when the latter died at Colombes in August.<br>
<br>By 1674 Duchess Mary had been granted a pension of &pound;1000 a year for life. Her daughter Mary, who had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58099/', "Lord Richard Butler (1639&#150;1686)")</script>, later first earl of Arran, had died in July 1668; Thomas Howard died in the summer of 1678. Little is known of her last years, although she has recently been advanced as one of several possible identifications of &#145;Ephelia&#146;, whose verse circulated between 1679 and 1682. The duchess of Richmond, as she continued to be known, died in November 1685 and was buried on 28 November in the Richmond tomb in Westminster Abbey, with her second and third husbands and her son, and near to her father.<br>
