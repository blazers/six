<span class="headword">Smith,  (Edwin) Rodney</span>, Baron Smith  (1914&#150;1998), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at 224 Balham High Road, London, on 10 May 1914, the eldest son of Edwin Smith (1870&#150;1937), a medical practitioner and coroner, and Edith Catherine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer), a professional violinist. He enjoyed his time at Westminster School (1927&#150;31), where he excelled academically (he was king's scholar in 1928), became a good cricketer, and was an exceptionally good violinist. &#145;He contemplated music as a profession but stayed with surgery because, he was wont to remark, a surgeon could enjoy music, but a musician could hardly undertake surgery as a hobby&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 28 July 1998). He became a medical student at St Thomas's Hospital where he distinguished himself academically both as the William Tite and Peacock scholar and Grainger prizewinner and athletically at cricket, scoring a double century at the Oval in the Surrey county second eleven. He passed the MB BS London examinations in 1937 but was precluded by the death of his father from securing the honorary house officer posts at his hospital. Smith went into general practice in south London; on 26 March 1938 he married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1916/17), daughter of Edward Rodwell, a schoolmaster, and, soon after, secured the FRCS at the earliest possible time. In 1939 he became surgical registrar at the Middlesex Hospital where he came under the influence of Webb Johnson, who was president of the Royal College of Surgeons for six years and was only the third surgeon to be created a peer. In 1941, after joining the Royal Army Medical Corps, Smith obtained the MS (London) and saw active service as a surgical specialist in north Africa, Palestine, Italy, and Yugoslavia. He distinguished himself as a skilled, efficient surgeon but was wounded at the Anzio beachhead.<br>
<br>After the war, Smith was appointed in 1946 consultant surgeon to St George's Hospital, where he soon made a great reputation for pancreatic and biliary surgery. He worked extraordinarily hard and published many articles and books. He was awarded a Hunterian professorship in 1947, the Jacksonian prize of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1951 and another Hunterian professorship in 1952. He was appointed to the Penrose May tutorship of the college in 1957, continuing in this post for six years, until his election to the council of the college where he became the dean of the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences in 1966. He succeeded in modernizing the institute, which was no small task. His multi-volume <span class="italic">Operative Surgery</span> was published in 1956; he edited this <i>magnum opus</i> with Charles Robb of St Mary's Hospital. In 1962 he joined the court of examiners.<br>
<br>Following the failure of his marriage, which was dissolved in 1971, Smith married on 20 May 1971 Susan Fry (<i>b</i>. 1931/2), a medical photographer, with whom he had worked. He was elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons on the sudden death in office of Sir Edward Muir in 1973. From the point of view of the profession, his election could not have occurred at a better time because no sooner had he assumed the office than the profession was plunged into conflict with the Labour government. Through his skilful and non-confrontational approach, peace was restored and Barbara Castle, the secretary of state, was relieved of her office. Smith was knighted in 1975. He was a great success as president of the Royal College of Surgeons and enjoyed every moment of his four years in office.<br>
<br>One of Smith's many ambitions was to follow in the footsteps of his great mentor and hero, Lord Webb Johnson, who was president for six years. Although he did not succeed in this, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Smith in 1978, in recognition not only of his outstanding presidency but also of his vital role in defusing the conflict between the secretary of state for health and the medical profession. Again, his expertise at bridge-playing proved an asset as he partnered prominent members of the Labour cabinet, allowing him easy access to the corridors of power which he used surreptitiously and to excellent effect; he had a close liaison with Lord Goodman. &#145;His quip that he had been created a peer in order to strengthen the bridge team in the House of Lords may have been modestly meant but the incidental self-congratulation about his bridge prowess was characteristic&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 July 1998). Lord Smith continued to show his skill at solving complicated problems when he became president of the Royal Society of Medicine and he soon established peace among the warring factions. Sadly, his presidency of the British Medical Association was cut short by a stroke which occurred while he was operating; he suddenly found himself completely unable to speak. His second wife, Susan, discovered that the area of his brain concerned with chess and bridge was unimpaired and she methodically tutored him so effectively that he recovered his ability to speak remarkably well. Although the House of Lords is tolerant and courteous, reading from a script at question time is not acceptable and is usually accompanied by shouts of disapproval, and this unfortunately precluded Lord Smith from making many comments in the house, as he found it difficult to speak without a script.<br>
<br>Lord Smith's recovery from this devastating stroke was in no small measure due to his wife, and it came as no surprise that he accepted the presidency of the Stroke Association and fought on their behalf with great enthusiasm. He was able to return to the operating theatre where his expertise in pancreatic and biliary surgery was unrivalled in his day. His achievements were more than recognized by the gold medals and honorary fellowships which were showered upon him. Only Lord Porritt equalled his achievements in receiving honorary fellowships from all the colleges of surgeons in the English-speaking world. He was an excellent golfer, an accomplished chess player, and played bridge for England. Among his hobbies were numismatics and opera and after he retired he took up painting with his usual enthusiasm and skill.<br>
<br>Lord Smith was clearly an ambitious, determined man who took infinite trouble to have things in good order, be it his surgical skills in biliary and pancreatic surgery, his bridge playing, or his diplomacy in the medical hierarchy and among the Labour politicians. His life at the top seemed to preclude many close friends. Lord Smith died on 1 July 1998 at Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Westminster. He was survived by his second wife, Susan, and three sons and a daughter by his previous marriage.<br>
