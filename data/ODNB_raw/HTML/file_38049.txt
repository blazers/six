<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tate,  Maurice William</span>  (1895&#150;1956), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at 28 Warleigh Road, Preston, Brighton, on 30 May 1895. He was the eldest in the family of three sons and seven daughters of Frederick William Tate (1867&#150;1943), professional cricketer, and his wife, Gertrude Beach. One of his younger brothers, Cecil Frederick Tate, played a few first-class games for Derbyshire and Warwickshire between 1928 and 1933. Maurice Tate was educated at Belvedere School, Haywards Heath, but was not good enough to play for the school eleven, and aspired rather to become a farmer. However, encouraged by his father, he had a trial for Sussex County Cricket Club when he was fifteen and made his d&eacute;but when he was seventeen. Fond legend has it that his father, following his own somewhat traumatic part in the 1902 test against Australia at Old Trafford when his dropped catch contributed substantially to defeat in a close-run contest, consoled himself with the anticipation that his son, then but a seven-year-old, would compensate in effective kind. He lived to enjoy that pleasure.<br>
<br>Tate played for Sussex from 1912 to 1937, with an interruption of four seasons during the First World War when he served in France as a signaller in the Royal Artillery. During his Sussex career, embracing 525 matches, he took 2211 wickets for the county at an average cost of 17.41 runs. No mean bat, he also scored just over 17,000 runs for Sussex, and he did the double of 100 wickets and 1000 runs seven times for Sussex alone. Counting all first-class cricket he completed the much-cherished double in eight domestic seasons and once overseas. Three times he took 200 wickets and scored over 1000 runs in a season, while his best bowling performance was nine for 71 for Sussex v. Middlesex at Lord's in 1926. In all first-class cricket he had 2784 victims, at an average of 18.16, and he took 100 wickets in each of fourteen seasons. With his hard-hitting and combative style he scored 21,717 runs (average 25) in all first-class cricket, his highest score being 203&#151;one of his twenty-three centuries&#151;for Sussex against Northamptonshire at Hove in 1921. Earlier in that year, on 20 January 1921, he had married Kathleen Miriam, the 21-year-old daughter of Alfred Charles Freeman, artist, with whom he had twin daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Although Tate made his considerable name as a bowler, it is proper to acknowledge that, as one of only nine cricketers to have accomplished the substantial feat of scoring 20,000 runs and taking 2000 wickets, he should be recognized as one of cricket's leading all-rounders. It was as a bowler that he was first chosen to play for England; he made his d&eacute;but in 1924 and thereafter won thirty-nine caps, including appearances in twenty consecutive test matches against Australia, and nineteen against South Africa, India, and the West Indies. He took 155 wickets, at an average of 26.16, for England, quite a haul for the period, his best series being during the MCC tour of Australia in 1924&#150;5, when he took thirty-eight wickets, a record for England versus Australia until broken by J. C. Laker in 1956, just after Tate's death. He is still regarded as second only to the great S. F. Barnes as the scourge of Australian batsmen on their own soil.<br>
<br>Under the influence of the Sussex and England captain A. E. R. Gilligan, who converted him from the slower mode he had inherited from his father, Tate developed into a fast medium bowler from 1922. He was able to control deceptive swerve and telling accuracy over exacting periods. His briskness of pace off the pitch became legendary and he is said to have been the first bowler deliberately to have deployed the ball's seam in his technique. He is generally regarded as one of the best two or three fast medium bowlers in cricket's annals, with only notables such as Sir Alec Bedser or George Lohmann, both of Surrey, thought of as worthy of comparison. As C. B. Fry, cited in Tate's <span class="italic">Wisden</span> obituary, said, Maurice Tate &#145;could make the ball rear off the pitch like a snake striking&#146;  (Green, 877).<br>
<br>&#145;Chubby&#146; Tate was the most whole-hearted and cheerful of competitors. He was a large, strong man of genuinely and pleasantly rustic character. He constantly bore a huge grin and this, together with his massively booted feet, made him the darling of the sports cartoonists of his day, notably Tom Webster of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. That greater press coverage, coupled with the social efforts of colleagues such as Herbert Sutcliffe and Walter Hammond, marked the transition in the status of professional cricketers from the old-style &#145;feudal&#146; position to something more akin to a well-respected technician. Maurice Tate was the first &#145;pro&#146; to captain Sussex; he was made an honorary life member of the county club, where memorial gates commemorate him, and he was one of twenty-six former professionals made MCC life members in 1949. He published his memoirs in 1934, and in the early 1930s sponsored commercial products including Hovis bread and Shredded Wheat breakfast cereal.<br>
<br>Tate's decline was abrupt&#151;he was no longer a lethal bowler&#151;and his first-class career ended in 1937, when he was &#145;paid off&#146; by the county in circumstances that left him aggrieved. He played professional league cricket for Walsall for a spell, and undertook occasional journalism. During service in the Second World War he was commissioned as a billeting officer, a further sign of the cricket professional making good. In 1950 he was appointed cricket coach at Tonbridge School. The amiable host of several Sussex hostelries, Tate died suddenly from a blood clot at the Greyhound Hotel, Wadhurst, Sussex, where he was landlord, on 18 May 1956. He was buried in Wadhurst churchyard, survived by his wife.<br>
