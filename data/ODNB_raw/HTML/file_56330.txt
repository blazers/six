<span class="headword">Maitland,  Edward Maitland</span>  (1880&#150;1921), <span class="occ">air force officer and developer of airships and parachutes</span>, was born at 156 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 21 February 1880, the elder son of Arthur Gee (<i>d</i>. 1903), a farmer and later barrister and JP, of Shudy Camps Park, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Margaretha Marianne Maitland. Arthur Gee and his family assumed the surname Maitland in 1903. Educated at Haileybury and Trinity College, Cambridge, Edward Maitland volunteered for service in the South African War while he was still an undergraduate. He was commissioned in the Essex regiment and served in South Africa during 1901&#150;2, receiving the Queen's medal with four clasps. Without resuming residence in Cambridge he took a BA (ordinary) in 1906 and obtained a third class.<br>
<br>Remaining in the army, in 1907 Maitland took up ballooning. The following year, with two companions, he made a record 1171-mile voyage to Russia. He also made his first descent from a balloon by parachute. After service at the Balloon School in Farnborough, he commanded the airship company in the short-lived air battalion of the Royal Engineers (1911&#150;12), and then, on the formation of the Royal Flying Corps, was given command of 1 squadron (airships). In 1913, when all British airships came under naval control, he transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). In the same year he made his first parachute jump from an airship.<br>
<br>In October 1914 Maitland was sent to Belgium in charge of an RNAS balloon detachment for artillery spotting. He became impressed with the superiority of the French and Belgian kite balloons over his own spherical type, reported accordingly to the Admiralty, and was promptly recalled to initiate kite-balloon training at Roehampton in March 1915. From this he moved on to command the airship station at Wormwood Scrubs, and then went to the Admiralty to help in airship design and allocation. During this period he made a parachute descent from a balloon at 10,500 feet to investigate &#145;swinging&#146;. In 1916, as a wing captain, he was appointed to command the airship station in Pulham, Norfolk, where Zeppelin imitations&#151;rigid airships of a greatly improved type&#151;were later to be based.<br>
<br>In June 1917 Maitland was appointed to the DSO for &#145;extremely valuable and gallant work in connection with airships and parachutes&#146;. Shortly afterwards he returned to the Admiralty as captain-superintendent, lighter-than-air, to take charge of the airships headquarters staff. In this post he helped to build up the airship service into a major weapon in the war at sea. RNAS non-rigid airships, able to stay aloft for many hours and send down reports by wireless, did important work on patrol and convoy escort, many times directing British destroyers into contact with the enemy's U-boats. Further recognition followed for Maitland with appointment as CMG (1919) and the award of the AFC (1919) and the American DSM (1917).<br>
<br>July 1919 saw what was probably his greatest moment, when the naval rigid airship R34, with Maitland as chief observer, crossed the Atlantic successfully in both directions. The following month he received a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force, soon afterwards being promoted air commodore. With the transfer in October of all rigid airships from the Royal Navy to the RAF, Maitland continued at the Air Ministry his work on airship development and operations, but with civil uses now in view.<br>
<br>In 1921 Maitland's previously brilliant career ended in misfortune and tragedy. He was in command of the airship station in Howden, Yorkshire, when on 21 January the R34 struck some high ground, was buffeted in strong winds off the Yorkshire coast, and later broke up. In May the Air Ministry decided to disband the RAF's airship arm. The newly constructed R38, the largest airship yet built, had been sold to the USA in 1919, but was still based in Howden for training and trials. When on 24 August 1921 she broke up over the Humber on a final exercise in sharp turns, Maitland, on board but not in command, died with forty-two others. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Among those who accompanied Maitland on the R34, and who died on the R38, was <a name="cosubject_56330"></a><span class="headword">John Edward Maddock Pritchard</span>  (1889&#150;1921), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, who was born at Rushmere Lodge, Heath and Reach, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, on 28 December 1889, the son and only child of John Walter Pritchard (1842&#150;1911), dentist, and his wife, Emily Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maddock (1851/2&#150;1914). His father, an American citizen, had fought in the American Civil War. His parents were of Welsh descent and in 1897 purchased The Priory, Cardigan, of which his mother wrote a history. Pritchard was brought up there, educated by private tutors, before in 1909 being admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took passes in political economy and natural sciences, and graduated BA. He became a mining engineer, his occupation when he married on 2 October 1913 Hilda Elizabeth (1884&#150;1974), daughter of Peter Caldwell-Smith, medical officer of health. He then studied at the Royal School of Mines, London, and undertook a survey of Flintshire lead and zinc mines.<br>
<br>Pritchard was commissioned a flight sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service in May 1915, and was posted to the Roehampton kite-balloon station. His first airship command was on sea patrols at Polegate, Sussex, after which he was posted to Mudros in the east Mediterranean in 1916, also on airship patrol duties. He returned to Polegate later that year, and had airship postings at East Fortune, then Howden in 1917. On the creation of the RAF in 1918 he was promoted to acting major. Early in 1919 he was Admiralty airship representative at the peace conference in Paris, and was appointed OBE in June 1919. With the rank of major, he joined the R34 transatlantic crossing in July 1919 as a technical observer, taking the official photographs reproduced in Maitland's account and making cloud observations. On reaching Mineola, Long Island, USA, on the morning of 6 July 1919, Pritchard parachuted from a height of 2000 feet to make preparations for mooring the airship. He thus had the distinction of being &#145;the first man to land in America by means of the air&#146;  (Maitland, 84) and was dubbed the &#145;air pilgrim&#146; in the American press  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 7 July 1919). He was a member of the crew on the successful flight back to Britain, which landed at Pulham, Norfolk, and along with other crew members was awarded the Air Force Cross. On his return he undertook technical flying duties under the airship research division of the Air Ministry. While serving as an observer for the ministry he was killed in the R38 over the Humber estuary on 24 August 1921. He was survived by his wife and their daughter and two sons.<br>
