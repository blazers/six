<span class="headword">Matonabbee</span>  (1736/7&#150;1782/3), <span class="occ">fur trader and explorer</span>, was born near Churchill Fort, in what is now Churchill, Manitoba, the son of Chipewyan parents; his father was a hunter for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). His mother and father had met on the west coast of Hudson Bay when his mother was freed from the captivity of Cree fur traders by Richard Norton, chief factor of the HBC's post at Churchill. Matonabbee's background gave him the rare ability to move smoothly between British and Chipewyan cultures. Orphaned at an early age, he was adopted by Richard Norton, who introduced him to the fur trade. On Norton's retirement in 1741 Matonabbee's father's relatives took him to their homeland north-west of Hudson Bay. There he learned the survival skills he would use later in life. In 1752 he returned to Churchill, where he worked as a hunter to supply HBC company employees with fresh meat. Later he began forays into the Cree territory around Lake Athabasca. The Cree and the Chipewyans were long-standing enemies; however, Matonabbee was able to broker a peace with the encouragement of the HBC, which believed that warfare interfered with trading opportunities. Although the peace was temporary, its impact on Matonabbee's reputation was permanent. At Churchill he received the titles ambassador and mediator  (Hearne, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 225).<br>
<br>In 1762 Matonabbee was asked by Moses Norton, Richard's son, to find the northern copper mines, rumours of which had been heard at Churchill since 1716. Matonabbee and a companion, Idotyazee, returned to Churchill five years later with a copper sample. Together, Matonabbee, Idotyazee, and Norton created a map to guide an HBC expedition to the mine. However, by the time Norton had finished the preparations, Matonabbee, his choice for expedition leader, had disappeared.<br>
<br>Beginning in 1769, the explorer, fur trader, and HBC employee Samuel Hearne twice tried and failed to reach the copper source. Matonabbee met Hearne as he returned from the second attempt, and quickly attributed previous failures to the lack of Chipewyan women. Matonabbee told Hearne: &#145;there is no such thing as travelling any considerable distance, or for any length of time, in this country, without their assistance&#146;  (Hearne, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 35). Matonabbee agreed to lead a third expedition, which included his seven wives. The eighteen-month trek became one of the most celebrated Arctic adventures, unique because Hearne acquiesced to Matonabbee's seasoned knowledge of geography, diplomacy, and survival. In one of its best-known episodes a group of Chipewyan joined the expedition to attack a group of Inuit, camped by the mouth of the Coppermine River, in revenge for recent unexplained illnesses; twenty-one Inuit were killed. The expedition reached the mythic source of copper soon after but, as Matonabbee and others had intimated before to the HBC, the mines were of little commercial value. Hearne and Matonabbee searched for more than four hours to find one sizeable piece. When the expedition returned to Churchill on 30 June 1772 Norton immediately proclaimed Matonabbee chief of all the Chipewyans.<br>
<br>Matonabbee's prominence as a trader ended prematurely in the autumn of 1782 or winter of 1782&#150;3 when he arrived with furs at Churchill to discover the settlement in ruins and abandoned following an attack by two French frigates returning from the American War of Independence. One year later Hearne and a small crew returned to reopen Churchill. It was, however, too late for Matonabbee. On seeing the basis of his livelihood and reputation reduced to rubble, he had hanged himself. As testimony to Matonabbee's indelible influence, Hearne devoted much of his published narrative about the journey to the Coppermine River to expressions of admiration for the abilities and character of the Chipewyan chief.<br>
