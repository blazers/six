<span class="headword">Babington,  Churchill</span>  (1821&#150;1889), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was born at Roecliffe, Leicestershire, on 11 March 1821, the only son of Matthew Drake Babington (1788&#150;1851), rector of Thringstone, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1873), daughter of Benjamin Fleetwood Churchill. He was connected with the Macaulay family, and slightly, on his mother's side, with that of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5397/', "Charles Churchill")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/970/', "Charles Cardale Babington")</script> was his father's cousin. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1839. While he was still an undergraduate his youthful love of nature found expression in a contribution to T. R. Potter's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest</span> (1842). He graduated BA in 1843, being the seventh in the classical tripos, and a senior optime in mathematics, and was president of the Cambridge Union in 1845. In 1846 he graduated MA, was elected a fellow of St John's College, and was ordained, having gained the Hulsean prize for an essay entitled &#145;Christianity in relation to the abolition of slavery&#146;. From 1848 until 1861 he was perpetual curate of Horningsea, Cambridgeshire. In 1849 he published a defence of the English clergy and gentry of the seventeenth century against T. B. Macaulay's aspersions in the famous third chapter of his <span class="italic">History of England</span>. Gladstone, in reviewing G. O. Trevelyan's life of Macaulay in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1876), was strongly impressed with Babington's essays, and considered that he had convicted Macaulay at least of partiality.<br>
<br>In 1850 Babington was entrusted by the university with the task of editing the recently discovered fragments of <span class="italic">The Orations of Hyperides Against Demosthenes, and for Lycophron and for Euxenippus</span> from the papyri found at Thebes in Upper Egypt, and his edition was issued in two volumes (1850 and 1853). In 1855 he brought out an edition of <span class="italic">The Benefits of Christ's Death</span>, supposed to be by the Italian reformer Aonio Paleario. In 1860 he edited for the Rolls series R. Pecock's <span class="italic">Repressor</span>, and in 1865, for the same series, the two first volumes of R. Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>. In 1865 he was elected Disney professor of archaeology at Cambridge, and published his inaugural lecture. He was re-elected to the chair in 1870 and 1875. His contributions to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</span> included the articles on medals, glass, gems, inscriptions, seals, rings, and tombs. He made numerous contributions to the journals of learned societies, such as the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span>, Hooker's <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, and the <span class="italic">Suffolk Institute Papers</span>.<br>
<br>Babington left Cambridge in 1866, relinquishing his fellowship, and accepted the rectory of Cockfield in Suffolk. In 1869 he married Matilda Whytt, daughter of Colonel John Alexander Wilson RA, but left no children. In Cockfield, Babington was able to concentrate his attention on ornithology, and the result was his very thorough monograph on <span class="italic">The Birds of Suffolk</span> (1886). During his last years he took up the study of conchology, and formed a fine collection both of British and exotic shells. He was an exemplary parish clergyman, and applied his archaeological knowledge in the restoration of Cockfield church, which took place during his incumbency and culminated in the erection of a new organ in 1887.<br>
<br>Babington proceeded DD in 1879. In the following year he resigned the Disney chair of archaeology and was elected an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. He died at Cockfield rectory on 12 January 1889, and was buried in the parish churchyard.<br>
