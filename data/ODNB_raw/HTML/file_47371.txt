<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lawson,  John James <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>, Baron Lawson  (1881&#150;1965), <span class="occ">coalminer and politician</span>, was born on 16 October 1881 at Dobson's Buildings, Whitehaven, one of ten children of John James Lawson (<i>d</i>. 1930?), a merchant seaman turned miner, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Savage (<i>d</i>. 1929?). Although he knew material hardship in his early years, Lawson's childhood experiences in the small Cumberland villages of Kells and Flimby gave him an abiding love of the countryside and the seashore, while his elementary schooling at the Glass House national school, Whitehaven, opened the door to a lifelong enjoyment of books. When Lawson was nine, his family moved to Boldon colliery, in co. Durham; and on leaving the Boldon colliery school in 1893 he joined his father and older brothers down the pit, at a starting wage of 10<i>d</i>. a day. He progressed steadily through the hierarchy of pit work to reach the &eacute;lite grade of hewer in 1904; and on 22 February 1906 he married Isabella Graham (1882&#150;1968), a domestic servant, daughter of Robert Scott, a machinist. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>As a young miner, Jack Lawson was torn between two conflicting interests, gambling and self-improvement. However, at about the age of twenty he underwent a religious conversion and joined the Wesleyan Methodists; he was an active lay preacher for the rest of his life. At the same time his pursuit of knowledge through a mixture of private reading and public debate led to a growing interest in social problems and socialist solutions. By 1905 he had joined the Independent Labour Party and taken the first step towards a possible trade union career on being elected an assistant checkweighman by his fellow hewers. All this made him obvious material for Ruskin College, the recently established trade union college at Oxford. He was offered a scholarship there in 1906, and his wife went back into service to help support him. &#145;Thrilled and inspired beyond words&#146; in 1937 by reading H. A. L. Fisher's <span class="italic">History of Europe</span>, Lawson recalled these early years when &#145;you kindly took me, with other obscure ones, into a special class &hellip; shall I ever forget those days of spiritual exaltation when I sat at your feet?&#146;  (Lawson to Fisher, 10 Jan 1937, Bodl. Oxf., MS Fisher 73, fol. 1). On completing his studies, Lawson rejected the possibility of making a new career in teaching or the ministry, and took the deliberate decision to resume his work as a miner.<br>
<br>After returning to co. Durham, Lawson threw himself into local Labour politics. He acted as agent for the socialist Pete Curran at Jarrow in the general election of January 1910, and in 1913 he was elected to Durham county council, on which he sat for the next ten years. Following war service as a driver in the Royal Artillery, he was chosen to fight Seaham Harbour for Labour in the &#145;coupon&#146; election of 1918, but lost to the sitting Liberal. However, in the turbulent post-war world the political tide in the British coalfields was running strongly in Labour's favour; and in 1919 Lawson entered the Commons in a by-election for Chester-le-Street. He held the seat continuously, rarely polling less than seventy per cent of the popular vote, until he retired in 1949.<br>
<br>During thirty years as a member of parliament, Lawson's first loyalty was always to &#145;his own people&#146;, the pitmen of the north-east and their families. He dealt assiduously with his constituents' personal problems, especially in matters of pensions and benefits, and he was vociferous in demanding government action to deal with the wider regional issues of poverty and unemployment. Given his background, he was a strong contender for junior office in Ramsay MacDonald's two minority administrations. In the first Labour government of 1924 he became MacDonald's parliamentary private secretary along with Clement Attlee, and also served as financial secretary to the War Office; while in 1929&#150;31 he was parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Labour under Margaret Bondfield. As the jobless total rose inexorably in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street crash, Lawson's department came in for serious criticism from Labour's trade union allies for its unsympathetic handling of unemployment problems; but his personal reputation seems to have suffered little as a result.<br>
<br>As one of the few survivors of Labour's electoral d&eacute;b&acirc;cle in 1931, Lawson's future looked uncertain. Gradually, however, his career recovered. He joined the opposition front bench in 1937; and on the outbreak of the Second World War he was appointed deputy commissioner for civil defence in the northern region. This was a demanding job, both physically and emotionally, especially in the early years of the war, when the industrial north-east suffered heavy German bombing raids; and the accidental death of a young grandson, whom the Lawsons had brought up as their own, in the aftermath of one such raid was a personal tragedy from which perhaps he never fully recovered.<br>
<br>Following Labour's landslide victory in 1945, Attlee&#151;with whom Lawson enjoyed a warm personal friendship&#151;offered him the cabinet post of secretary of state for war, charged with the urgent task of ensuring a swift, orderly, and equitable demobilization of the wartime armed forces. His duties included a 35,000 mile round trip to India and the Far East, during which he justified his policy at sixty mass meetings of troops eagerly awaiting their discharge. Within little more than a year of his appointment ill health forced his reluctant resignation from the government; but by then he had completed the immediate task to his own satisfaction. After three years on the back benches he retired from the Commons to become vice-president of the National Parks Commission; and in March 1950 he went to the House of Lords as Baron Lawson of Beamish.<br>
<br>For much of his time in the Commons Lawson supplemented his salary by journalism and occasional broadcasting, dispensing homespun philosophy and personal observations in accessible, and often poetic, language. Among his more substantial writings were full-length character sketches of two older miners' leaders whom he had known personally: Durham's Peter Lee and the phlegmatic Yorkshireman Herbert Smith. However, his best-known and best-loved work was his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Man's Life</span> (1932), which had sold over 30,000 copies by the time Lawson retired from the Commons. Its insights into working-class life, its individual style, and its author's patent modesty and sincerity marked it out as a classic of its kind. Not only does it provide the essential key to understanding Lawson's own beliefs and achievements: it was also influential in creating the enduring image of the Durham miners as the backbone of the British labour movement in the twentieth century. James Callaghan in 1977 gave &#145;the book I had admired for many years&#146; to President Carter on his visit to Durham, and claims that Carter read it on his flight home  (J. Callaghan, <span class="italic">Time and Change</span>, 1977, 482).<br>
<br>Jack Lawson's socialism was always more sentimental than scientific. Pragmatic and patriotic, his good sense, moderation, and reliability won him friends and admirers in all walks of life and all political parties; for example, he kept up an amicable correspondence with the high tory historian Arthur Bryant. Once it had been realized that figures such as Lawson posed no real threat to the established order, his personal qualities made him a worthy candidate for public honours and non-partisan appointments. He was awarded an honorary DCL by Durham University in 1947, and the freedom of Sunderland in 1950; but he took particular pride in becoming, in 1949, the first pitman to be lord lieutenant of co. Durham. He filled the post with an easy grace for nine years, during which he claimed to have attended over 1500 functions and meetings. Yet if he enjoyed the recognition which came his way, he also remained unambitious and unspoilt. He never became a rich man, and for the last forty years of his life he lived in the same small cottage in Beamish, among the &#145;ordinary folk&#146; whom he had sought to serve.<br>
<br>Lord Lawson died in Chester-le-Street General Hospital on 3 August 1965, and was buried at West Pelton churchyard, co. Durham. A memorial service in Durham Cathedral on 13 September made an appropriate end to a career which epitomized the almost painless incorporation of the Labour Party into British public life during the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
