<span class="headword">Traill,  William Atcheson</span>  (1844&#150;1933), <span class="occ">promoter of electric railway traction</span>, was born at Ballylough House, Bushmills, co. Antrim, the third son and sixth child of William Traill, a local protestant landowner, and his wife, Louisa French. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36547/', "Anthony Traill (1838&#150;1914)")</script> became high sheriff of Antrim and, in 1904, provost of Trinity College, Dublin. Educated at private schools, William went to Trinity College, Dublin, taking an engineering degree in 1865 and the master of engineering, M(Ing), in 1873.<br>
<br>Traill joined the geological survey of Ireland in 1868 and became an expert in water supply. He resigned in 1881 to promote his life's work, the electrically powered Portrush, Bushmills, and Giant's Causeway Railway and Tramway Company (to use its final name) founded by himself and Anthony Traill to transport local minerals. Capital was raised from friends at Trinity, although Sir William Siemens (&pound;3500) and Lord Kelvin (&pound;1000) were also shareholders in the &pound;20,000 company. Despite many efforts, the goods business never materialized, and the line became a summer season only tourist business until its closure in 1949.<br>
<br>Steam services began early in 1883, electric cars working sporadically from September 1883. Regular electric services began on 5 November 1883 following the completion of a hydroelectric plant at Walkmills, the railway being the first to use hydroelectric power. The line was initially 6 miles long with another 2 mile extension to Giant's Causeway opening on 1 July 1887. Traill patented (no. 3277, 1883) a conduit system of burying the live rail in a pipe with electrical contact by means of a mechanism he devised. He used a simple third rail system on the rural stretches, but steam trams were used in Portrush until 1900 when a 500 volt overhead cable was installed along the entire route. The conduit patent was sold to an American company &#145;for a small sum&#146;  (McGuigan, <span class="italic">Giant's Causeway Tramway</span>, 105). Conduits were popular with tramways, but they installed devices independently invented in America in 1884.<br>
<br>Traill showed that electric railways worked, thereby inspiring many more electric railway lines. He devoted his life to his company and local affairs, though he was on the general council of the British Association. Traill was married first to Harriet Jane Wrigley, who died in 1888, then to Elizabeth Greer; they had a son (<i>b</i>. 1890) and a daughter (<i>b</i>. 1891). He met his third wife, Nora Westwood (<i>d</i>. 1953) in 1895, when he rescued her from drowning off Portrush. He died at his home, Rockhaven, Port Stewart, north Antrim, on Thursday 5 July 1933, survived by his third wife, and daughter. His last few weeks had been spent in organizing the railway's jubilee.<br>
