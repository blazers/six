</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  Joseph</span>  (1858&#150;1895), <span class="occ">explorer in Africa</span>, the fifth and final son of William Thomson and Agnes Brown, was born on 14 February 1858 in the village of Penpont, Dumfriesshire, in a house which his father, a stonemason and master builder, had built for himself and his family. In 1868 the household moved 4 miles away to Gatelawbridge, where William Thomson leased an underdeveloped freestone quarry.<h2>
<a name="Thebuddingexplorer"></a>The budding explorer</h2>Thomson began his education in the village school in Penpont, but owed his growing interest in the wider world to the stimulation of a new school and new acquaintances in the nearby small town of Thornhill. It was in the classes of the Morton School, and particularly from the lectures and cane of its stern Presbyterian principal, that Thomson obtained the bulk of his formal education. He read avidly: Shakespeare and Scott, the adventure stories of Robert Michael Ballantyne, and, some time after his eleventh birthday, a volume of travel literature that prominently featured the explorations of Mungo Park, James Bruce, Robert Moffat, and David Livingstone. The young Scot determined to follow in Livingstone's footsteps.<br>
<br>From age fourteen Thomson also became a budding geologist. Stimulated by Dr Thomas Boyle Grierson, a warm-hearted eccentric and self-appointed popularizer of science and scientific thinking who had established a flourishing medical practice in Thornhill, Thomson began to collect botanical and geological specimens, and to discuss his findings with the members of Grierson's local Society of Inquiry. With hammer in hand he roamed the hills of Nithsdale looking for unusual outcrops or formations of rock. He discovered a few fossil forms that were new to the Lower Carboniferous limestone of Scotland. It was during a solitary outing in the narrow ravine of Crichope Linn that Thomson met Professor Archibald Geikie of the University of Edinburgh, who was then examining Nithsdale for the Geological Survey. Geikie apparently persuaded Thomson to take geology seriously, and to leave his apprenticeship in his father's stone quarry (he had left school at fifteen) for Edinburgh. There Thomson matriculated in 1875, studied with Geikie, Alexander Crum Brown (chemistry), John Hutton Balfour (botany), and Thomas Henry Huxley (natural history), and ultimately achieved medals in natural history and geology in the examinations of 1878.<h2>
<a name="LeadingtheTanganyikaexpedition"></a>Leading the Tanganyika expedition</h2>In that year Thomson, aged twenty, was appointed geologist and naturalist to an expedition under Alexander Keith Johnston the younger, which was sent by the Royal Geographical Society to open up a road from Dar es Salaam to lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika. After a practice trek from Pangani into the Usambara Mountains, Johnston, Thomson, James Chuma (a Presbyterian-trained Yao, who had worked with Livingstone and was a professional caravan leader), five assistant headmen, and 125 porters set out from Dar es Salaam for the interior on 19 May. Johnston died on 28 June 1879 from dysentery and malaria near what is now Kwa Mhinda along the northern banks of the Rufiji River. Thomson found himself in charge. &#145;I felt I must go forward,&#146; he wrote, &#145;whatever might be my destiny&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">To the Central African Lakes and Back</span>, 1881, 1.150). Thomson and Chuma led their expedition via Kilengwe and Mgunda across the Rufiji to Ifakara and on through the countries of the Hehe and the Bena into the Kipengere Mountains. Finally, his body racked with fever, Thomson plunged into the northern waters of Lake Nyasa on 22 September 1879.<br>
<br>Thomson next examined the unexplored plateau separating lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika, becoming the first European to traverse its 250 miles of mountain and valley. He met chiefs of the Nyakyusa, Namwanga, Mambwe, and Lungu peoples, and on 3 November camped on the southern shores of Lake Tanganyika, which had first been sighted by Livingstone and Chuma in 1867 from a village nearby. He could have returned home with honour. Instead, taking just thirty-eight of his men (he wanted to trek briskly), he continued northward along the western shores of Lake Tanganyika. He reached the stockaded village of Pamlilo, where Verney Lovett Cameron had stopped in 1874, and went through the hostile country of the Tumbwe, to the village of M'pala, which Livingstone had visited in 1869. On Christmas day 1879 Thomson finally reached the Lukuga River and found it unmistakably flowing swiftly west, and thus emptying, not filling, Lake Tanganyika. His epic journey continued across the lake to Ujiji, then back to the Lukuga River, and then westward towards the headwaters of the Za&iuml;re River. After almost reaching that point, he went back to the lake, and then by sailing vessel south along its eastern shores to rejoin the remainder of the caravan on 5 April 1880. Thomson and the whole caravan proceeded via Lake Rukwa, which he was the first European to see, and what is now Tabora to Bagamoyo on the coast, where he arrived on 10 July.<br>
<br>Thomson had trekked 3000 miles in the unusually short period of fourteen months. There had been no major fights, no defections, and no unnecessary loss of life. He had collected nearly 200 new species of flora (including a tree fern named after him) and 15 new species of lacustrine conchology (one named after him), and had made some general observations on geology, terrain, and cartography.<br>
<br>Thomson's next enterprise was undertaken for the sultan of Zanzibar, who believed that the coal which Livingstone had reported in 1862 to exist in the Rovuma valley might be turned to profitable account. The sultan invited Thomson to make an expert examination. This he did for eight weeks in 1881, covering some 700 miles only to bring the sultan the disappointing news that the &#145;coal&#146; was only useless shale.<h2>
<a name="ExploringLakeVictoriaandtheNiger"></a>Exploring Lake Victoria and the Niger</h2>A very different task was that to which Thomson, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society, next braced himself&#151;the opening up of a route between the seaboard of eastern Africa and the northern shores of Lake Victoria. The society wanted Thomson to explore the &#145;snowy mountains&#146; of eastern equatorial Africa, to find a route through or around the country of the fearsome Maasai, and to discover new trading opportunities in the face of threatened German competition.<br>
<br>On 15 March 1883, Thomson, a Maltese named James Martin, and five experienced African headmen, led a caravan of 110 porters up country from Mombasa. They were a few months behind Dr Gustav A. Fischer, a German naturalist, and his entourage. Thomson's expedition traversed the hills of Tahta and reached Taveta on 5 April. Two weeks later, while enjoying the hospitality of the Chagga, he tried to climb Kilimanjaro in a day, but failed to reach beyond 8700 feet. In July Thomson finally attempted to lead his party across dreaded Masai. In order to do so peacefully, he had to persuade various groups of Maasai warriors that he had magical powers. This task he accomplished by popping two false teeth in and out of his mouth and, whenever danger approached, brewing up a fizzy froth of Eno's fruit salts. The expedition reached Ngong, near what is now Nairobi, in September, entered hilly Kikuyu country, then descended to the floor of the Great Rift valley. Thomson climbed the 9000 foot Mount Longonot, stopped along the shores of Lake Naivasha (where Maasai tormented him), climbed steamy Mount Eburru, and walked to Lake Elmenteita.<br>
<br>With thirty of his porters, Thomson impulsively decided to investigate Mount Kenya. On 28 October he viewed its &#145;chaste beauty&#146; from the banks of the Uaso Nyiro River. He could have been the first European to climb it but instead, always in haste, he and his men trekked to rejoin the rest of their party at Lake Baringo. Then he continued onward, through Nandi country, reached the vicinity of modern Eldoret, glimpsed and named Mount Elgon, and easily crossed northern Kavirondo reaching the shores of Lake Victoria near the modern border of Kenya and Uganda on 10 December. On the return journey, Thomson was gored by a wounded buffalo and, weak from that injury and from malaria, and subsequently from acute dysentery, was carried much of the distance to the coast, which he reached early in June 1884.<br>
<br>Once again Thomson had travelled nearly 3000 dangerous miles without firing a shot in anger. He had demonstrated the accessibility of Lake Victoria, described many lakes new to Europeans, verified and provided information about Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, added considerably to the world's ethnographic knowledge of the Maasai and other indigenous peoples, shot and named a gazelle, and collected five new species of flora as well as 135 other important specimens.<br>
<br>By the end of 1884 Thomson was fit to undertake new explorations, and when, in 1885, the Royal Geographical Society bestowed on him the founder's gold medal, he was already in Nigeria. On this occasion he was employed by the National African Company. His mission was to forestall the efforts of Germany by obtaining territorial concessions from the sardauna of Sokoto and the emir of Gwandu. By mid-March 1885 Thomson was in Akassa, at the mouth of the Niger River. He proceeded up river to Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benue River, and thence to Raba. He assembled a caravan of 130 porters and then went overland to Kontagora, and into Hausaland. Traders and people were everywhere; nothing reminded him of east Africa. In May he was welcomed into the palace of the sardauna, the ninth Sarkin Musulmi, ruler of nearly all of what was to become Northern Nigeria. At the end of the month, after exchanges of presents and promises of more, the Sarkin Musulmi signed a treaty giving the company territorial and trading privileges. The emir of Gwandu did likewise two weeks later, and Thomson returned to Britain where, however, his treaties were never confirmed by the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>Thomson was twenty-seven, and, for some months, seriously ill. &#145;There seems to be very little chance of any more exploring on the big scale,&#146; he wrote. &#145;Africa is played out &hellip;&#146;  (Thomson, 174). During 1886 he lectured in Britain, and travelled on the continent as far as Italy. He campaigned for a friend and home-rule parliamentary candidate in Thornhill, and one summer's day walked the 70 miles from Thornhill to Edinburgh in sixteen hours. He was asked to lead an expedition to rescue Emin Pasha (Eduard Carl Oscar Theodor Schnitzer), then supposedly cut off in the southern Sudan; but Henry Morton Stanley was chosen instead. In 1888 Thomson published <span class="italic">Ulu: an African Romance</span>, a two-volume novel about Africa, to take his mind off not being chosen to relieve Emin. The setting was Chagga, and Africans and whites were involved in a contrived but delightful love triangle, a kidnapping, and a battle against a marauding Maasai war-party.<br>
<br>&#145;I am thoroughly tired and disgusted with life in England,&#146; Thomson confided in early 1888  (Thomson, 199). A few months later he decided to explore the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, and by May he was in Marrakesh. Despite troubles with his porters, a street brawl, and difficulties with local sheikhs, he climbed two high peaks, the 11,000 foot Jebel Ogdemt and the 12,870 foot Jebel Likoumt. He also surveyed other promontories in the mountains and visited many of the mountain towns before passing along the north-western flanks of the Atlas range to Agadir, on the Atlantic coast. By October he was in Casablanca, <i>en route</i> for home.<h2>
<a name="Thomsonslastjourney"></a>Thomson's last journey</h2>Thomson's final foray into Africa was at the behest of Cecil Rhodes. In 1890, after spending the intervening year writing several articles on Africa as well as a commissioned biography of Mungo Park, Thomson was asked to go on a treaty-making expedition to copper-rich Katanga (Shaba). He first sailed to Cape Town, and then went by rail to meet Rhodes in Kimberley. There Rhodes gave him orders to fill out the British South Africa Company's claims to trans-Zambezia by making treaties with local chiefs and, if possible, to persuade Msiri, believed to be the leading chief in Katanga, to do so as well.<br>
<br>Thomson and James Grant sailed up the Zambezi and Shire rivers from Quelimane, on the Mozambique coast. From Chiromo, at the southern end of modern Malawi, they and their porters tramped overland to Blantyre, where Charles Wilson joined the expedition. Soon the party reached Nkhota Kota, on the western shores of Lake Nyasa, from where they began their westward trek in August. Thomson began making treaties with Bisa chiefs in the Luangwa River valley of what became eastern Zambia. Across the Muchinga Mountains, somewhere east of Serenje, he discovered that several of his porters had come down with smallpox. Despite a growing contamination, he pushed his party westward to the Luapula River, about 200 miles from Msiri's town. At Kavoi, near the modern Ndola, it became difficult to obtain local guides and Thomson himself was in terrible pain from cystitis.<br>
<br>There, in the middle of central Africa, 50 miles from the great copper deposits of modern Zambia and Za&iuml;re, Thomson lost much of his appetite for exploration and discovery. Yet he crossed the Za&iuml;re&#150;Zambezi watershed, headed south-west toward the Kafue River, made treaties near the modern Kapiri Mposhi and Kabwe, crossed the Mkushi, Lukusashi, and Luangwa rivers going eastward, and returned to Lake Nyasa in early January 1891. He had traversed 1200 miles, made thirteen treaties of dubious authenticity with chiefs across central and eastern areas of modern Zambia, and was himself very sick. He suffered from very painful stricture of the urethra, incontinence, and other complaints that were probably caused by schistosomiasis and pyelo-nephritis.<br>
<br>Thomson was never again free from pain. Nevertheless, he managed to write several articles for geographical and literary journals before contracting serious pneumonia in 1892. In 1893, seeking relief for his damaged lungs, he sailed for Cape Town and spent three months in the tiny Karoo rail town of Matjiesfontein. Subsequently, Rhodes sent him to Kimberley for more recuperation. He went back to Scotland, still weak and wasted, in mid-1894. In the hope of easing what was probably rampant pulmonary tuberculosis, Thomson travelled to Italy and southern France in early 1895, but on 2 August of that year, at 3 York Gate, London, he died, aged thirty-seven.<br>
<br>Thomson travelled more than 15,000 miles in Africa without causing more than occasional hard feelings. He bothered and disturbed Africans little. His motto was &#145;He who goes gently, goes safely; he who goes safely goes far&#146;  (Rotberg, 300). As a traveller, Thomson was swift and economical; but he was also hasty, missing many opportunities to claim a significant place in the annals of African discovery. His scientific methods were too often impressionistic, though now and then based on flashes of insight. He was a man of action, not a student of the little known.<br>
<br>It was as a man of action that Thomson provided valuable information about Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, about the flow of the Lukuga River, and about the absence of coal along the Rovuma. He &#145;discovered&#146; the Rift valley. He demonstrated the accessibility of lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika overland, and then of Lake Victoria. Active during the twilight of exploration in Africa, he filled in details and corrected earlier impressions.<br>
<br>Thomson's important books were <span class="italic">To the Central African Lakes and Back</span> (2 vols., 1881) and <span class="italic">Through Masailand</span> (1883). He also wrote <span class="italic">Ulu</span> with E. Harris Smith (2 vols., 1888); <span class="italic">Travels in the Atlas and Southern Morocco</span> (1889); and <span class="italic">Mungo Park and the Niger</span> (1890). In addition there were some thirty-five articles, thirty of which were about Africa.<br>
