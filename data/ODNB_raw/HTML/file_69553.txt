<span class="headword">Maynard,  (Vera) Joan</span>  (1921&#150;1998), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 5 July 1921 at Brooklands, Easingwold, Yorkshire, the daughter of Matthew Maynard, a small farmer trying to scratch a living from 17 acres of land, and his wife, Effie Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright. She was educated at a local village school in Ampleforth, leaving at the age of fourteen. In the late 1930s the family abandoned the struggle with the farm and moved to Thornton-le-Street, where they took over the post office and Joan did a postal round. She later recalled it as her first lesson in economics that she was paid less than the men for doing the same job.<br>
<br>In 1945 Maynard and a handful of others met in Thirsk to found a Labour Party branch and challenge the hegemony of the local squire. She was elected secretary and electoral agent of the Thirsk and Malton branch, which grew from its tiny beginnings to become one of the biggest in the country. She was appointed a magistrate in 1950, in 1952 she stood successfully for the South Kilvington district council, and in 1956 she became a North Riding county councillor. She became Yorkshire county secretary of the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers (subsequently the Agricultural and Allied Workers Trade Group of the Transport and General Workers' Union) in 1956. It was a post she held for twenty-two years, including a period as national vice-president from 1966 to 1972, a position in which she is said to have so irritated the leadership of the union that, unable to stop her being repeatedly elected, they simply abolished the post.<br>
<br>Maynard took a seat on the Labour Party's national executive in 1972 after a conference speech calling for the nationalization of land, and in 1974 successfully stood for the parliamentary seat of Sheffield Brightside, thus becoming one of the few working-class women ever to be elected to parliament. In her maiden speech she declared her pride at being &#145;the only sponsored Member for farm workers &hellip; I speak for one of the lowest-paid groups&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, vol. 880, 6 Nov 1974, col. 1135). Within hours of taking her seat she was lobbying ministers for a bill to secure tenure for farmworkers, to end the tied-cottage system which caused misery for many rural workers and their families who would lose their homes if they lost their jobs. She got 180 MPs to sign an early day motion on the issue and spoke about it at the first meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that she attended. Within two years the <span class="roman">Rent (Agriculture) Act</span> was law.<br>
<br>Maynard always spoke for the crusading spirit of the Labour Party, which made her more popular with the membership than with most of her parliamentary colleagues. She espoused a wide range of left-wing causes, being in favour of Britain's withdrawal from Northern Ireland and an extension of public ownership; and against nuclear weapons, the Common Market, the Falklands War, and Labour's &#145;tinkering with capitalism&#146;. She was at odds with the Labour leadership in the turbulent 1970s and early 1980s, when she stood for traditional Labour values against those who called themselves modernizers but whom she saw as betrayers of the working class. Nevertheless her membership of the select committee on agriculture for twelve years from 1975 saw her forming an unlikely alliance with the Conservative Sir Richard Body to oppose the excesses of factory farming. She also found unexpected allies in her opposition to the common agricultural policy and the fight to save her beloved Hambleton Hills from electricity pylons.<br>
<br>Maynard became chair of the Campaign Group of MPs, formed to represent the left in 1981 following Tony Benn's failure to be elected deputy leader of the Labour Party, but the tide had already turned against them and Maynard lost her seat on the national executive committee in the following year. She regained her position on the national executive committee in 1983 but the left was no longer a powerful force, and the actions of Maynard and like-minded colleagues were now limited to such protests as a walkout in 1986 to cause the collapse of disciplinary hearings against members of the Marxist militant group. Her advancing age but continued championship of socialist causes acquired her the nickname &#145;Stalin's Grandmother&#146; (her response to which was that Stalin's grandmother was probably a pillar of the Russian Orthodox church in Georgia, and therefore rather more conservative than herself).<br>
<br>Despite Maynard's trenchant political views, she was known to be kind and gentle. She bore the burden of caring for her elderly parents until their deaths, then cared for her elder sister who developed Alzheimer's disease, then for an elder brother. She retired from the House of Commons and lost her seat on the national executive in 1987. She died at her home, Lansbury House, 76 Front Street, Sowerby, Thirsk, on 27 March 1998, of stomach cancer, and was buried at St Oswald's, Sowerby, on 3 April. She was unmarried.<br>
