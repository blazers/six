<span class="headword">Brown,  Alfred Reginald  Radcliffe-</span>  (1881&#150;1955), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born Alfred Reginald Brown on 17 January 1881 at 39 Farm Road, Aston, Warwickshire, the second son and last of three children of Alfred Brown (1834&#150;1886), manufacturer's clerk, and his second wife, Hannah (<i>c</i>.1845&#150;1925), daughter of Owen Radcliffe, engineer, and his wife, Susan Smith. By 1917 he was adding Radcliffe to his name, following the lead of his brother Herbert whose middle name it was, and began assuming the hyphenated form by 1923. He was educated at the Commercial Travellers' School, Pinner, Middlesex, from 1890 to 1896; at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, from 1896 to 1898, where he was a foundation scholar; and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1902 to 1906, to which he won an exhibition in 1901. There he read for the mental and moral science tripos, and obtained a second class (division 1) in part one (1904) and a first in part two (1905); he was trained in anthropology by A. C. Haddon and W. H. R. Rivers. He married Winifred Marie Lyon (<i>b</i>. 1880), daughter of Algernon Jasper Lyon, a Cambridge solicitor, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Mason, on 19 April 1910. They had one child, Mary Cynthia Lyon Radcliffe. Radcliffe-Brown and his wife had become estranged by about 1926, but did not divorce.<br>
<br>Seemingly possessed by a wanderlust, Radcliffe-Brown spent well over half his adult life outside England. He was a fellow of Trinity College from 1908 to 1914, a master at the Sydney Church of England grammar school from 1915 to 1917, and director of education in the kingdom of Tonga from 1918 to 1919, and was the first professor of anthropology at the universities of Cape Town from 1921 to 1925, Sydney from 1926 to 1931, and Oxford from 1937 to 1946. He held chairs at Chicago from 1931 to 1937, and Alexandria from 1947 to 1949, and was also a visiting professor at Yenching (Yanjing) University in China, from 1935 to 1936, the University of S&atilde;o Paulo in Brazil from 1942 to 1944, and Rhodes University in South Africa in 1952. If his career was brilliant, his childhood circumstances had been difficult, and he was fortunate to have been admitted to the Commercial Travellers' School, founded in 1845 to provide for &#145;the destitute Orphans of deceased and the Children of necessitous Commercial Travellers.&#146; School records show that his family had neither property nor expectations.<h2>
<a name="Apioneerofsocialanthropology"></a>A pioneer of social anthropology</h2>Although he did not achieve the standards later set by Bronislaw Malinowski, in which emphasis is placed on long-term participant observation of a limited area, Radcliffe-Brown was one of the first British anthropologists to undertake fieldwork on his own, principally in the Andaman Islands from 1906 to 1908, and Western Australia from 1910 to 1912, with shorter periods in several states of Australia between 1914 and 1930. Some uncertainty surrounds the circumstances of his main research, especially in the Andamans, about the deficiencies of which he had no illusions, but he did not&#151;as is sometimes claimed&#151;depend there or in Australia on the inmates of gaols and hospitals. He travelled extensively in his Australian fieldwork, obtaining information especially on kinship, social organization, and totemism, thus laying a foundation for the comparative and analytical studies for which he had a natural talent and with which his name is especially associated.<br>
<br>Radcliffe-Brown's role in creating the academic discipline of social anthropology in English-speaking countries was &#145;immense&#146;  (Pocock, 54) and is unmatched even by Malinowski. Effectively it began with his Cape Town appointment, though he had lectured in Cambridge, London, and Birmingham before the First World War. The courses he developed at Cape Town and subsequently at Sydney drew the attention of undergraduates to the nature of African and Australian societies, the comparative method, and the theories of the French sociological school. He conveyed a clear and comprehensive view of the scope and method of anthropology and a sense that new ground was being broken and obsolete theories overthrown. The difficulty in both countries of instituting and maintaining an adequately funded programme of research was all the more disappointing because he was confident that his type of anthropology could solve ethnographic problems, discover laws of society, and provide enlightened guidance to governments and the public.<br>
<br>In South Africa and Australia anthropology had been developed by amateur scholars, some of whom achieved much in spite of their isolation. In the United States, where the discipline was already well established in universities, Radcliffe-Brown's approach stimulated a number of anthropologists &#145;to reconsider the whole matter of method, to scrutinize their objectives, and to attend to new problems and new ways of looking at problems&#146;  (Redfield, ix). In particular, he staked a claim for anthropology, or comparative sociology as he also called it, to be the basis of a possible unified natural science of society, and sought to undermine counter-claims by economics and psychology to provide models for this science. Once again, however, he remained for only a few years before leaving for another country. Whatever hopes he brought to Oxford came to little owing to the suspension of anthropology during the Second World War and his retirement, which he is said to have resisted, shortly afterwards. Later he regretted having left Chicago  (Stocking, &#145;Yours affectionately, Rex&#146;, 4&#150;5, 8).<br>
<br>Radcliffe-Brown conceived of anthropology as an &#145;investigation of the nature of human society by the systematic comparison of societies of diverse type&#146;  (Radcliffe-Brown, <span class="italic">Method</span>, 133). He attached great importance to the study of primitive societies (though he also encouraged studies of communities in China, India, and Japan and was appreciative of W. L. Warner's Yankee City series), partly because of their differences from Western civilization and partly because they were changing or being destroyed so rapidly. Investigation involved a series of steps: carrying out intensive field research; demonstrating how institutions such as kinship, religion, politics, and economics are interconnected; and analysis in terms of the concepts of social structure and social function (the concept of social value was important to him in principle, but less salient in practice). Social structure, not culture, was the linchpin in this scheme of inquiry. Thus unlike Malinowski, who understood function as essentially biological, Radcliffe-Brown defined it as the contribution a belief or custom made to the maintenance of the social structure. Although the stress in his work, as in that of the anthropologists most influenced by him, was on synchronic rather than diachronic studies, he held that all societies resulted from a process of evolution which explained the great variety among them.<br>
<br>Radcliffe-Brown has been taxed with ignoring conflict and assuming that customs and institutions work smoothly together to serve a larger purpose&#151;hence the comment that &#145;a dose of Marx or Adam Ferguson would have done Radcliffe-Brown the world of good&#146;  (E. E. Evans-Pritchard, &#145;Fifty years of British anthropology&#146;, <span class="italic">TLS</span>, 6 July 1973, 763). In fact, he never supposed that simple solidarity was the only characteristic of human life. His early opinion that opposition &#145;is of the utmost importance to inquiry&#146;, is expressed in war and between the sexes, and &#145;is as fundamentally necessary to human society as solidarity&#146;, was further developed in lectures to Sydney students on &#145;social opposition&#146; or &#145;socially regulated antagonism&#146;  (Maddock, 11, 15). It was also conveyed to a wider audience in his Huxley memorial lecture (1951), when he argued that the &#145;Heraclitean union of opposites&#146; has been often used &#145;not only in the establishment of systems of cosmology but also in organising social structures&#146;  (Radcliffe-Brown, <span class="italic">Structure</span>, 115). True, his writings do not convey the impression that &#145;social arrangements are transient creations based on domination, and ever liable to challenge from a new social movement&#146;  (N. McInnes, <span class="italic">The Western Marxists</span>, 1972, 23&#150;4). But societies of the kind in which Radcliffe-Brown was most interested were not characterized by class conflicts or challenged by revolutionary or reform movements developing from within. Their transformation, as he knew from his Andamanese, Australian, and African experience, arose from contact and collision with alien societies.<br>
<br>Speculation about the sources of Radcliffe-Brown's anthropology has often derived it mainly from one pre-eminent figure, usually Rivers or Emile Durkheim. In fact, he placed himself in &#145;a cultural tradition of two hundred years&#146;  (Radcliffe-Brown, <span class="italic">Structure</span>, 14) originating with eighteenth-century thinkers, mostly from France or Scotland, who included Montesquieu, Lafiteau, and Adam Ferguson&#151;and further developed by some of the pioneering sociologists and anthropologists of the nineteenth century. As he did not engage in scholarly exegesis of the work of others it can be difficult to discern their precise significance in his thought. A number of influences can, however, be identified with some confidence. For example, his interest in natural science (and art) began as a schoolboy, his first reported lecture being on zinc mines in Cumberland to the Natural History Society at King Edward VI School on 21 February 1898 (not long after his brother, who became a mine surveyor in South Africa, had graduated in engineering science from King's College, London). His interest in anthropology and in French sociology also predates Cambridge, having been awakened by Peter Kropotkin and Havelock Ellis respectively. To these sources he added Herbert Spencer's hypothesis of social evolution, the methodology of the French sociologists, and the ideas of Heraclitus and Chinese philosophy on social and cosmic dualism. Rivers and Durkheim may have been the most important influences, but he criticized aspects of their thought and it would be wrong to see him as a disciple&#151;discipleship, as opposed to influence or inspiration, would have conflicted with his scientific outlook.<br>
<br>Radcliffe-Brown wrote with &#145;crystalline clarity&#146;  (J. G. Peristiany, &#145;Obituary&#146;, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 17 Dec 1955, 1149) and had the gift of enthusing students, &#145;with whom he was always ready to discuss the problems of their science, not only in the lecture room but at any time and in any place. He numbered these students all over the world&#146;  (Evans-Pritchard, 200). Yet he published relatively little and wrote slowly, confessing to Winifred Hoernl&eacute; that he could spend a week over one or two sentences. His difficulty was not shortage of ideas. As Raymond Firth wrote to Camilla Wedgwood on 22 September 1929, &#145;R. B. has many projects; I should like to see some of them mature&#146;  (Wedgwood papers, NL Aus., MS 483, box 1). The only book he completed was <span class="italic">The Andaman Islanders</span> (1922), based on his first fieldwork. Other planned works, including a collaborative study of African religion and social structure with Winifred Hoernl&eacute;, his 1937 Chicago seminar on a natural science of society, his Josiah Mason lectures at the University of Birmingham on primitive cosmology (1951), and an introduction to social anthropology, were never finished, though a stenographic version of the original Chicago seminar circulated during his lifetime and was published after his death.<h2>
<a name="Appearancepersonalityandinterests"></a>Appearance, personality, and interests</h2>Radcliffe-Brown's appearance and manners fascinated contemporaries. The biologist and novelist E. L. Grant Watson, who knew him from Cambridge and accompanied him in Western Australia, described him as a man of dramatic personality and inventive genius, &#145;beautiful to behold&#146; as he expounded anthropology  (<span class="italic">But to what Purpose</span>, 83&#150;4). The educationist Professor D. D. T. Jabavu, who attended his vacation school lectures in Cape Town, reported him to be &#145;tall of stature, with the typical flowing hair of the carefree genius&#146; and to possess &#145;a sense of humour and joie de vivre in his subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cape Times</span>, 24 March 1924). According to a popular Australian magazine, his &#145;aesthetic appearance has earned for him the sobriquet of &#147;the Valentino of the 'Varsity&#148;. This versatile professor of anthropology is equally at home in discoursing on the latest movements of modern art as he is in determining the age of paleolithic relics&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Home</span>, 1 Oct 1928). Student songs captured his flamboyance. In one he is bad, mad, and faddy, frequents gas-bagging bohemian circles, is the idol of Sydney's younger set, and is pally with Government House  (<span class="italic">Sydney University Song Book</span>, 1928).<br>
<br>Outside anthropology Radcliffe-Brown had an astonishing range of interests on which he addressed university and other audiences. He opened art exhibitions, spoke on music, debated the authorship of Shakespeare's plays and championed both modernism and the League of Nations. He spoke with few or no notes and with a few exceptions (including articles for <span class="italic">Art in Australia</span> on the painters Lionel Lindsay and Margaret Preston) did not develop his views in writing. His circle of acquaintances also extended beyond academe to embrace artists, writers, and bohemians. In Sydney, for example, they included Lionel and Norman Lindsay, Aletta Lewis, Ethel Anderson, George Lambert, and Christopher Brennan. Perhaps he would have achieved more in anthropology had he concentrated his energy, but his versatility and personal qualities attracted students of the new discipline and helped recruit some who would take leading positions in it. Moreover, his thoughts out of class were of a piece with his approach to anthropology and help throw light on it. For example, what he admired in modern art was its scientific spirit and love of clarity, its appeal to intellect and hatred of sentimentality&#151;even the brutality of modern German painters, he told the Society of Artists, could be commended as &#145;a good antidote to the over-sentimental&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 19 Sept 1929). Addressing a conference on international affairs, he stated that antagonism is &#145;as necessary to the life of society as solidarity&#146; and cannot be eliminated  (<span class="italic">Sydney University Union Recorder</span>, 2 Oct 1930, 250).<br>
<br>Nicknamed &#145;Anarchy Brown&#146;, he was an anarchist as a student, but &#145;not of the violent bomb-throwing type, though he had known several of these&#146;  (Watson, &#145;To this end&#146;, 90). He came to see the anarchist ideal, unlike socialism, as unrealizable, but saw the latter as having a dangerous tendency to glorify the state. His later views might be described as libertarian in a non-doctrinal sense, characterized by freedom from convention and sympathy for &#145;unpopular but intellectually defensible causes&#146;  (Firth, 296). An atheist from at least his student years, he became an honorary associate of the Rationalist Press Association in 1952. An Oxford student remembered him as &#145;somewhat assertive in his arguments against religion&#146;  (C. Fuller, &#145;An interview with M. N. Srinivas&#146;, <span class="italic">Anthropology Today</span>, 15/5, 1999, 5), but the nearest he came to showing it in print was the suggestion that religion is a source of &#145;fears and anxieties from which [men] would otherwise be free&#151;the fear of black magic or of spirits, fear of God, of the Devil, of Hell&#146;  (Radcliffe-Brown, <span class="italic">Structure</span>, 149). In the Josiah Mason lectures founded by the Rationalist Press Association, he denied that the secret ceremonies of Australia and New Guinea are based on &#145;sham and fraud&#146;, insisting that the old men in charge used secrecy as a method of conveying their sense of the world as a mysterious place. In general he avoided intruding his personal values into anthropology, holding that the anthropologist's job is to investigate beliefs as part of social reality, not to determine whether they are true or ethical or logical. His restraint may have sprung from an austere conception of science or from the functionalist fear that destroying a people's beliefs will undermine their social system.<br>
<br>Radcliffe-Brown died on 24 October 1955 at University College Hospital, St Pancras, London, and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
