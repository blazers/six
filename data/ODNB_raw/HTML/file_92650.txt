<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Palmer,  Robert Allen</span>  (1949&#150;2003), <span class="occ">singer and songwriter</span>, was born on 19 January 1949 at the maternity hospital in Batley, Yorkshire, the son of Charles Leslie Palmer, a naval engineer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lockwood. He was brought up from 1950 in Malta, where his father served with the Royal Navy, and attended a naval school there. About 1960 the family returned to England, where Palmer attended Scarborough High School for Boys. He found this environment alienating after the more intimate education he had enjoyed in Malta, but took consolation in his passion for music. He had become enamoured of such singers as Nat &#145;King&#146; Cole and Billie Holiday after hearing their records on American Forces Network radio in Malta. He passed six O-level examinations in 1965. He briefly attended art college, leaving in disgust after a cleaner accidentally destroyed his portfolio. For the next two years he worked as a graphic artist, and fulfilled a heavy schedule of live performances with a local &#145;rhythm and blues&#146; (R&amp;B) band, the Mandrakes. His voice was ideally suited to material by American soul artists, and he moved to London in search of full-time musical employment.<br>
<br>In 1968 Palmer succeeded Jess Roden in the London R&amp;B band the Alan Bown Set. He had previously chosen to be known as Alan Palmer, but now he resumed using his real name to avoid confusion with his bandleader. His first assignment was to overdub vocals on their album, <span class="italic">The Alan Bown!</span> (1968), although the record was issued in the USA with Roden's original performances intact. On his twenty-first birthday, 19 January 1970, Palmer married the 22-year-old Susan Eileen Thatcher, a fabric designer; they had two children, James and Jane.<br>
<br>In 1970 Palmer joined the rock band Dada, where he first met the vocalist Elkie Brooks and the guitarist Pete Gage. The three musicians soon formed a new band, Vinegar Joe. The combination of Palmer's soul-inflected vocals and Brooks's earthier R&amp;B style attracted Chris Blackwell, the founder and head of Island Records, who signed Vinegar Joe in 1971. A year later they issued their d&eacute;but album, <span class="italic">Vinegar Joe</span>, the first of three LPs for the label. Although Palmer later dismissed the band as something he &#145;would happily sweep under the carpet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 27 Sept 2003) Vinegar Joe's raw-edged sound made them a popular live attraction.<br>
<br>Vinegar Joe disbanded in the spring of 1974, and Palmer launched a solo career with Island Records. These events provoked an estrangement from Elkie Brooks that lasted until his death. Chris Blackwell arranged for Palmer to record in New Orleans with the R&amp;B band the Meters. The result was an album of &#145;blue-eyed&#146; soul, <span class="italic">Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley</span> (1974). It launched a series of projects recorded outside the UK, including <span class="italic">Pressure Drop</span> (1976, recorded in New York) and <span class="italic">Secrets</span> (1979, recorded in Nassau, Bahamas). Palmer moved his family to Nassau in 1978. His album covers customarily showed him sharp-suited and surrounded by near-nude models, while the music was similarly slick.<br>
<br>Palmer's fascination with cutting-edge black music led him to explore sequencer technology on his albums <span class="italic">Clues</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">Pride</span> (1983). In 1985 he joined the all-star band the Power Station, alongside former members of Duran Duran and Chic. But he opted out of their live commitments, concentrating on his solo project, <span class="italic">Riptide</span> (1985), which became his biggest seller to date. The album's success was sealed by the hit single &#145;Addicted to Love&#146;, for which Palmer was awarded the 1987 Grammy award for best rock vocal performance. The song became notorious for Terence Donovan's glamorous, highly sexist video. The clip boosted Palmer's image as a lounge lizard and ladykiller, which increasingly overshadowed his talent as a vocalist. Many critics regarded him as the personification of 1980s &#145;yuppie&#146; taste. He rejected any connection between his personality and his image, explaining: &#145;I was set up. This guy made the video behind me&#146;  (Miserandino).<br>
<br>In 1987 Palmer and his family moved to Switzerland. Over the next few years he became a bona fide pop star, producing a succession of danceable disco-rock concoctions. He won a second Grammy award for his 1988 hit &#145;Simply Irresistible&#146;, and satirized his image in the video for &#145;Change his Ways&#146;. Despite attempts in the early 1990s to diversify his musical identity with covers of big band and Broadway standards, his sales figures dipped as the public turned its back on the perceived glossiness of the 1980s. In 1993 he divorced his wife and began a lengthy relationship with Mary Ambrose, who was portrayed on the cover of his next album, <span class="italic">Honey</span> (1994). Thereafter Palmer recorded only sporadically, with little commercial success, although the critics finally learned to distinguish his &#145;yuppie&#146; image from his vocal skills. His final album, <span class="italic">Drive</span> (2003), returned to the R&amp;B sound that was his natural environment. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 26 September 2003 at the Warwick Hotel in Paris, where he was staying with Mary Ambrose. He was survived by her and his two children, and was buried in his adopted home town of Lugano, Switzerland.<br>
