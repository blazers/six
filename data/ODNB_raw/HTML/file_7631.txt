<span class="headword">Digby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fitzgerald]</span>,  Lettice</span>, Lady Digby and <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Offaly  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1658), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the only surviving child of Gerald Fitzgerald (1559&#150;1580), Lord Gerald, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1632), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15755/', "Sir Francis Knollys (1511/12&#150;1596)")</script>. She may have lived first on her mother's Irish jointure lands at Portlester, Woodstock, and Athy, but these were forfeited on Catherine's remarriage to Sir Philip Boteler of Walton Woodhall, Hertfordshire. Shortly after a pre-nuptial settlement on 19 April 1598 Lettice married Sir Robert Digby (<i>bap</i>. 1575, <i>d</i>. 1618) of Coleshill, Warwickshire, a client of the earl of Essex; they had seven sons and three daughters. Following the successive deaths of her paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare and first Baron Offaly (1525&#150;1585)")</script>, and uncles Henry Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1597) and William Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1599), respectively twelfth and thirteenth earls, Lady Digby (as heir general) assumed the style of Baroness Offaly and claimed the title and certain lands, while the earldom went to the heir male, another Gerald Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1612). Although Sir Robert Digby represented his native county as an MP in 1601, thereafter the couple spent most of their time in Ireland.<br>
<br>Over the next two decades the Digbys made concerted efforts to consolidate their position. Making common cause with Mabel Fitzgerald, widow of the eleventh earl of Kildare, they pressured the fourteenth earl for restitution of jointure rights and concession of the Offaly title. Digby became a justice of the peace in co. Kildare and a member of the Irish privy council. He was an active supporter of the government in the Irish parliament of 1613 and in 1615 became a member of the council of Munster. With powerful friends at the English court, including Lady Digby's uncle William Knollys (1547&#150;1632), Villiers connections of her stepfather, and Digby's younger brother Sir John Digby, ambassador to Spain, the Digbys continued to press their case through the minority of Gerald Fitzgerald, fifteenth earl of Kildare (1611&#150;1620). The cost of the dispute meant that, when Sir Robert died on 24 May 1618, he left his estate, and Dame Lettice as his executor, in financial difficulties, but on 11 July 1619 James I awarded her and her heirs the manor and parsonage of Geashill, comprising considerable lands near Philipstown in King's county. Although the king dismissed her claim to be heir general of her grandfather, on 26 June 1620 he confirmed her as Baroness Offaly for life, stipulating that the barony was then to revert to the earls of Kildare. The baroness's eldest son, Robert Digby, was in compensation created on 29 July Baron Digby of Geashill.<br>
<br>Anticipating by several months the final formal transfer of Geashill into her hands, Lady Offaly took up residence at Geashill Castle and lost no time in placing an English clergyman, John Meall, in the local living. She regarded the estates as traditionally a nest of rebels, and energetically collaborated in setting up English plantations with successive guardians of the sixteenth earl of Kildare. From 1629 this was Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork, whose daughter Sarah had married Robert Digby in 1626. Following Sarah's death in 1633 her children lived with Lady Offaly at Geashill, provided for by their grandfather Cork. The plantations came in for fierce local resistance, and in 1642 Lady Offaly was closely besieged. She resisted with spirit, though the rebels sent four messages to remind her that the castle was garrisoned only by women and boys. In reply to their first summons to surrender she avowed her loyalty to the king, proclaiming &#145;I will live and die innocently and will do my best to defend my own, leaving the issue to God&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 10.19<i>n</i>). The besiegers' guns burst upon themselves, and she was at last rescued, in October that year, by Sir Richard Grenville. She then retired to Coleshill, in which her husband had left her a life interest and where she died on 1 December 1658, and was buried with her husband. A portrait of her at Sherborne Castle represents her with a book inscribed <span class="roman">Job</span> 19:20 (&#145;I am escaped with the skin of my teeth&#146;).<br>
