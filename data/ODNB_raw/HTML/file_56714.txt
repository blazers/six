<span class="headword">Gruffudd,  Elis</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1490, <em>d.</em> in or after 1556), <span class="occ">copyist and chronicler</span>, was born at Gronant Uchaf, Gwesbyr, Llanasa, Flintshire. He himself is the source for almost all that is known of his life and career, though a few details are supplied or confirmed by external references. His genealogy has not been recorded, but he appears to have inherited a small estate which became the subject of legal wrangling, and he probably had wide family and social connections as one of the minor gentry in Flintshire, which would have facilitated his entry into service with English nobility, as one of the many Welshmen who joined the retinues of English noblemen in the period. He served in several campaigns, probably from about the age of twenty: Venlo (1511), Cadiz (1511), Fuenterrabia (1512), and Tournai (1514 onwards).<br>
<br>Gruffudd entered the service of Sir Robert Wingfield in 1518 and accompanied him to Calais, where Wingfield was deputy in 1520. He was an avid observer of the meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1521, and he fought in the army of the duke of Suffolk in the campaign in France in the last months of 1523. He spent the next years, 1524&#150;9, as a member of the Wingfield household in London, describing himself as overseer of the mansion. Whatever his duties may have been, he found enough time to enjoy and to describe vividly many aspects of the life of London, and he also had leisure to compile, about 1527, a large compendium (Cardiff Central Library, MS 3.4) of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century gentry poetry, popular religious, historical, and astronomical treatises and lists, and a version of <span class="italic">The Seven Sages of Rome</span>, all typical of the native gentry culture of the time.<br>
<br>Gruffudd is best known, however, by his preferred self-description as &#145;a soldier of Calais&#146;. He enlisted in the garrison in January 1530 and spent the rest of his active life there. He married Elizabeth Manfield in Calais, acquired land, set up house, and had two children. He describes many of his duties as a soldier, and he clearly enjoyed the ceremonial aspect of military life, especially the opportunities afforded him to observe the comings and goings of leading figures. He was tipstaff about 1546.<br>
<br>Gruffudd continued his literary activities in Calais. During a period of ill health about 1548 he put together a collection of his translations of English medical books (NL Wales, Cwrtmawr MS 1). His most important work was an extensive chronicle of the six ages of the world from the creation to his own time, a two-volume manuscript (NL Wales, MS 5276 and Mostyn MS 158), which he arranged should be sent to a friend, probably a kinsman, at Pant-y-llondy, Gwesbyr, for safe keeping soon after its completion about 1552&#150;3 (the last date in the chronicle is 1552). Gruffudd was probably inspired to write his world chronicle by his knowledge of similar works in English and French. He was able to bring together in Calais a number of familiar histories. He names Ranulf Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> and John Trevisa's translation, Edmund Hall, John Rastell, and Jean Froissart, but for the most part he refers merely to &#145;French books&#146;, &#145;English books&#146;, &#145;English chronicle&#146;, &#145;my copy&#146; as sources. He rarely quotes directly from his sources but paraphrases and gives the gist of what he reads.<br>
<br>More remarkably Gruffudd had access to &#145;Welsh writings&#146;, unfortunately unnamed, and he also relied on oral sources (&#145;a credible person&#146;, &#145;old folk&#146;, &#145;some &hellip; others&#146;, &#145;the opinion of the people&#146;) from his own cultural inheritance, acquired from what must have been a rich oral and literary culture in the north-east Wales of his early years. His chronicle is well structured, and as it progresses it becomes increasingly focused on Wales, regarded here as part of English history. He has a sound grasp of Welsh legendary history so that he is able to include at the appropriate points some folk tales, the first full version of the Taliesin prose-verse tale, and an extended Arthurian section together with other material.<br>
<br>Throughout his chronicle Gruffudd comments critically on the value of his sources, literary and oral. He appears to have received little training as a scribe and he has a personal idiosyncratic literary style underlying which is a strong aural sense. He is, nevertheless, an intelligent and able writer with consciously developed literary skills. He has a fine eye for dramatic situations, both contemporary and historical, and he can write effective dialogue. His extended anecdotes are narratives carefully constructed to achieve his desired literary effects or to make an implicit comment. Though Gwenogvryn Evans may have claimed too much for him as the author of some of &#145;the most readable prose in the Welsh language after the <span class="roman">Mabinogion</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Welsh Language MSS</span>, viii), he is now recognized as a master of narrative and a serious and effective writer.<br>
<br>Always interested in life around him, Gruffudd is a keen observer of people and commentator on events so that, drawing on personal experience, recollections, and possibly notes taken during his long career, he can describe graphically what he sees and hears. His account of numerous closely observed contemporary events and his own well-judged comments on situations and conditions make him a valuable &#145;unofficial&#146; contemporary witness, but in Welsh historiography he represents the last stages of the declining traditional Welsh gentry culture recorded by one who represents the sociological changes which were transforming that class in the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Both Gruffudd and his wife were alive in 1556, but nothing more is heard of him after that. It is not known where or when he died.<br>
