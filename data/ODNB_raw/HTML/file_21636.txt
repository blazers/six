<span class="headword">Paxton,  Stephen</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1734, <em>d.</em> 1787), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was baptized on 27 December 1734 at St Oswald's, Durham, the son of Robert Paxton. He gained his early musical training as a cathedral chorister until his voice broke. He spent the greater part of his life in London, and the earliest reference to his activities as a cellist in the metropolis dates from 20 April 1756. On 5 June 1757 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Musicians. He married Martha Hunt (<i>d</i>. 1808) at St James's, Piccadilly, on 4 July 1771. His first published work appeared about 1772; his seven opuses included cello and violin duets, cello solos, glees, and lessons for cello and bass. He is listed as one of the four principal cellists at the first Handel memorial festival in 1784 and also played in 1786 and 1787. He performed principal parts at oratorio meetings, and Charles Burney praised his &#145;full and sweet tone&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 4.677) on the cello, combined with his &#145;judicious manner in accompanying the voice&#146;  (ibid.). On 21 March 1780 Paxton was elected a &#145;privileged member&#146; of the Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Catch Club. Four pieces by him gained gold medals: the serious glees &#145;How sweet! How fresh!&#146; (1779), &#145;Round the hapless Andr&eacute;'s urn&#146; (1781), and &#145;Blest pow'r, here see&#146; (1784), and the catch &#145;Ye Muses, inspire me&#146; (1783); &#145;Come, oh come, ethereal guest&#146; (1785) won a 5 guinea prize. Many of Paxton's glees are included in <span class="italic">Ladies' Amusement</span> (1791, vols. 1 and 2) and in Warren's <span class="italic">Collection of Catches</span>. He also composed and performed religious music, and was associated with the Sardinian chapel. He sold his music from his house, 29 Titchfield Street, London, and in music shops. Paxton died at Brompton Row, London, on 18 August 1787, aged fifty-two, and was buried in St Pancras churchyard. A requiem mass was held in his honour at the Sardinian chapel on 2 September; it is possible that he was a convert to Roman Catholicism. In his will, dated 2 May 1785, he counselled his widow &#145;to do Charitable Acts to my more distant Relations and to the Poor in General&#146;. It was noted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for September 1787 that his &#145;exemplary virtues and universal charity are ornaments that will make his memory ever respected&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 57/2, 1787, 837).<br>
<br>One of Paxton's brothers, <a name="cosubject_21637"></a><span class="headword">William Paxton</span>  (1725&#150;1778), born on 8 February 1725 at Durham, was based in Durham throughout his life and was chorister and then lay clerk at the cathedral. He too was a <span class="occ">cellist and composer of glees</span>, and to him has been ascribed the glee &#145;Breathe soft, ye winds&#146;, which appears in Stephen's collection. William's six entries in 1779 and two in 1780 to the Catch Club were put forward by Stephen; two of his canons gained prizes, &#145;O Lord in thee&#146; (1779) and &#145;O Israel, trust in the Lord&#146; (1780). He was buried at Durham on 7 May 1778.<br>
