<span class="headword">Main,  Thomas Forrest</span>  (1911&#150;1990), <span class="occ">psychiatrist and psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 25 February 1911 in Johannesburg, Transvaal, to James Robert Main (1872&#150;1946), shipwright and later mine manager, and Jessie Miller Dundas (1876&#150;1965). Main was one of three children; a fourth died in adolescence. His father joined the South African army in 1914, and the rest of the family returned home to Teesside in some poverty. His disabled father returned after the war.<br>
<br>An intelligent child, Main won a scholarship to the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1922, and at sixteen obtained a medical scholarship to Durham University. He was an excellent scholar and an outstanding rugby player. He began writing poetry at school and continued this throughout life, making gifts of poems to children, grandchildren, and godchildren. In 1933 he graduated MBBS with honours and obtained his MD (Durham) in 1937. At Newcastle there was an outstanding medical school where the paediatrician Sir James Spence, who highlighted the emotional components of children's illness, greatly influenced Main. Thereafter his aims turned to psychiatry: he obtained the diploma in psychological medicine at Dublin in 1936 and at an early age he became consultant psychiatrist at Gateshead Mental Hospital, Stannington, Northumberland. At medical school he had met his future wife, Agnes Mary 
    (Molly; <i>b</i>. 1911)
  , daughter of James McHaffie, a medical practitioner; he married her on 27 February 1937. They both became psychoanalysts after the war. Of their four children two followed his path into psychiatry and psychoanalysis.<br>
<br>Main's adventurous character was well suited to the new role for psychiatrists in the Second World War. To understand the anxieties of parachutists he made several jumps himself, and went to the front line in France to experience battle terror at first hand. Asked to study the causes of the Salerno mutiny, he attributed it to the forced regrouping of soldiers whose loyalty to their own regiments had been disregarded. He also studied the effects of battle training that had attempted artificially to stimulate hatred of the enemy but which had often led to depression. The practice was discontinued following his report. He took part in the outstanding achievements of military psychiatry&#151;officer selection, the handling of delinquents and misfits, and the maintenance of morale. Appointed psychiatrist to the Eighth Army, Main had a disagreement with General Montgomery and became psychiatric adviser to the twenty-first army group. As lieutenant-colonel he became a senior member of the team at Northfield Military Hospital, the foundation experience of the therapeutic community movement of which he was a leader in the years after the war. A good wordsmith, he coined the phrase &#145;therapeutic community&#146;, meaning that a hospital as an institution should study its own processes to enhance its therapeutic powers and to recognize its anti-therapeutic aspects. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Main had the opportunity to develop a therapeutic community at the Cassel Hospital for Functional Nervous Disorders, Ham Common, Surrey, of which he became director in 1946. The Cassel Hospital had been a private foundation of the Cassel family but became part of the National Health Service in 1948. The family (in the person of Lady Louis Mountbatten) retained close involvement for many years. Main undertook psychoanalytic training under Michael Balint, and was supervised by both grand ladies of British psychoanalysis, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein. At the Cassel Hospital he developed psychodynamic training for nurses and encouraged doctors to train as psychoanalysts. He involved the whole community&#151;lay staff and patients&#151;in consultation. However, he fought to maintain his position as medical superintendent, insisting that the organization needed a central authority. This suited him as he enjoyed his power and authority and his ability to bring about changes. The Cassel Hospital pioneered the psychotherapeutic treatment of mothers who had become depressed after childbirth, bringing their infants into hospital with them so as not to inflict separation on the nursing pair. Later, whole families were admitted and a nursery school was started. Gleefully he indented for double beds under the NHS. Later, Main joined Michael Balint in a short-term psychotherapy workshop that made a significant contribution to a new area of psychoanalytic work. His final achievement was to create the Institute for Psychosexual Medicine of which he was the principal leader and first president. Main fought orthodox psychiatry for its blindness to the findings of Freud and believed that psychoanalysis would take over biological psychiatry.<br>
<br>Main had charisma: handsome, elegant, silver-haired, and silver-tongued, always with a rose in his buttonhole, he was a stimulating teacher to generations of psychiatrists. Under his direction the hospital constantly evolved. A fine writer, his carefully crafted papers, edited by his psychoanalyst daughter, Jennifer, reached international readership. He became a vice-president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and would have been an innovative president both of the college and of the Psychoanalytic Society&#151;which ensured that he was not. Main was a sociable man who gave good parties, played the piano enthusiastically, and wrote fluent poems. A fanatical fly fisherman, he invented his own fly. He was an atheist in later life and was left wing in his politics. Main died of carcinoma of the colon at his home, 6 Sherwood Close, Barnes, London, on 29 May 1990 and was cremated on 7 June at Putney Vale crematorium. He was survived by his wife.<br>
