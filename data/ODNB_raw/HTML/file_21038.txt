<span class="headword">Owen,  William</span>  (1769&#150;1825), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 13 Broad Street, Ludlow, Shropshire, and baptized in Ludlow parish church on 3 November 1769, the eldest of the six children of Jeremiah Owen, hairdresser and bookseller, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1785). His father had trained for the church but failed to obtain a living and so returned to Ludlow to assist his father, William Owen (<i>d</i>. 1783), who had a barber's shop at 13 Broad Street. By 1779 Jeremiah Owen had enlarged the shop to include a bookselling and stationery business, but in 1800 he went bankrupt. Owen was educated at Ludlow grammar school. His uncle was butler to Richard Payne Knight and it was through his recommendation that Owen moved to London in 1786 and was apprenticed for seven years to the coach-painter Charles Catton RA (1728&#150;1798). Owen, however, wished to develop further and was encouraged by Sir Joshua Reynolds after he saw Owen's copy of his own painting, <span class="italic">Perdita</span>  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>). On 14 October 1791 he entered the Royal Academy Schools. His first work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the following year and he continued to exhibit every year, with the exception of 1823, until his death. His portrait of the dowager Lady Clive (exh. RA, 1793; priv. coll.) and other members of her family, together with Ludlow landscapes by Owen in her possession, indicate that she was an early patron of Owen's work.<br>
<br>Owen married the daughter of a London shoemaker who lived in the Haymarket. According to Farington (17 December 1803) the shoemaker was supposedly wealthy, but at his death was found to be insolvent, which resulted in Owen being declared bankrupt and carried to gaol in Dover. Farington (12 November 1803) also reported that Owen's supposed neglect of his wife was one of the reasons he was not elected a member of the Royal Academy earlier. However, he was elected ARA in 1804 and RA in 1806. Owen and his wife had one son, the Revd William Owen.<br>
<br>Owen's work comprised mainly portraits. His output was prodigious and he had a distinguished list of sitters including William Pitt, Lord Grenville, William Howley, Sir John Soane, and John Wilson Croker. Although his portraits were admired as truthful representations, contemporaries felt he &#145;did not succeed in displaying the graces of the female form&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 571), and that they lacked the fluency and sparkle of contemporaries such as Sir Thomas Lawrence. He painted and exhibited many rustic scenes and fancy subjects such as <span class="italic">Boy and Kitten</span> (1807; RA) and <span class="italic">Horatia Nelson Kneeling before her Father's Tomb</span> (NMM). Many of these became popular engravings. His work shows a strong sense of composition but his anatomical knowledge of the human figure and his drawing are sometimes weak. Owen was made portrait painter to the prince of Wales in 1810 and was commissioned to paint <span class="italic">Sir David Dundas</span> (1812; Royal Collection), which was well received. The prince of Wales promised to sit for Owen but never did, and he was left to copy John Hoppner's portrait of the prince.<br>
<br>Owen was a dark-haired, full-lipped, handsome man who, according to contemporaries, diligently carried out his duties at the academy, winning the students' respect. He became severely disabled by an infection of the spine and after 1820 was unable to paint. He died of poisoning on 11 February 1825 at his home, 33 Bruton Street, Berkeley Square, London, because a chemist's assistant mistakenly gave him a bottle of opium instead of a harmless draught. His funeral was held on 19 March 1825. Many of Owen's unfinished portraits were completed by Edward Daniel Leahy.<br>
