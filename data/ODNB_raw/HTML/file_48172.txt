<span class="headword">Samuel,  Frank</span>  (1889&#150;1954), <span class="occ">gramophone manufacturer and industrialist</span>, was born on 19 January 1889 at 20 Marlborough Place, London, the youngest of three children in the Jewish family of Nelson Samuel and his wife, Harriett Hymans. Nelson headed the prosperous family business of Barnett Samuel, an old established firm of London piano manufacturers and musical instrument dealers. Frank Samuel was educated at Clifton College and subsequently studied in Lausanne and Berlin.<br>
<br>In 1904, Samuel, together with his brother Edgar and two cousins, entered the family business, then undergoing a transformation caused by the new recording industry. A decade later, the four&#151;by this time presiding over one of the largest record wholesalers and dealerships in London&#151;patented the first portable gramophone which they called the Decca Dulcephone. This major breakthrough in the technology of recorded sound gave good-quality reproduction and the convenience of portability: the Decca could be carried around like a briefcase.<br>
<br>Poor eyesight excluded Samuel from war service in 1914, and he ran the business with his father while the other partners went off to fight. The essentially static nature of trench warfare meant that gramophones and records quickly became a feature of life on the western front. As a consequence, there was a brisk trade in Barnett Samuel's &#145;Trench&#146; model Decca, which allowed the company to prosper during these difficult years. The death of Edgar Samuel on active service in Flanders in 1916 meant that on his father's death in 1920 Frank Samuel became head of the company. He married Esther Marie, daughter of A. D. Benjamin on 20 December 1916, but the marriage did not produce any children.<br>
<br>During the ensuing decade sales of the Decca range of gramophones rocketed to become the most profitable area of the business. By 1928 turnover was seven times its pre-war level. In that year, Frank Samuel calculated that sales of Decca gramophones had probably peaked, and that in order to remain competitive his company had to expand and diversify. In addition, he and his family wanted to realize a part of their company fortunes. This led Samuel and the other directors to take Barnett Samuel to a successful flotation on the London stock exchange in 1928. In those boom days, the shares were over-subscribed by a factor of twenty, with Samuel's own share in the new business, renamed the Decca Gramophone Company Ltd, worth over &pound;100,000. At this juncture, Samuel sold his shares and severed his links with the business.<br>
<br>Freed from the demands of day-to-day management of a large concern, Samuel embarked on a world cruise. However this was cut short when he accepted the offer of a position as joint managing director with the United Africa Company (UAC), a commodity trading subsidiary of Unilever. Over the next decade, Samuel nursed this business through the ravages of the depression, diversifying its interests into heavy industry, motor vehicles, refrigerated food, and cargo shipping (the origins of the Palm Line). However, by 1938, although UAC remained in a poor financial condition, it had gained a reputation for exploitation and monopolistic practices, and Samuel's own expansionist aims of creating manufacturing and trading organizations from within the local African population themselves had foundered upon problems of capital and resource scarcity.<br>
<br>The coming of war in 1939 saw Samuel left to run the business while his colleagues went to war. The Second World War provided him with the opportunity to transform the company's fortunes. Also at this time other responsibilities came his way, specifically his appointment in 1940 to the main Unilever board. Like many other companies, UAC was co-opted by the Ministry of Food into the business of commodity requisition. Although this move deprived UAC of its usual speculative trading business, the company was able to shrug off its exploitative image; it also expanded its retailing, processing, and manufacturing sectors, opening up factories and stores across west Africa. Meanwhile, Samuel was recruiting younger men such as Arthur Smith and George (later Lord) Cole, both of whom went on to be chairmen of UAC and Unilever respectively.<br>
<br>Ironically, the Tanganyika groundnut scheme of 1946&#150;51 proved to be Samuel's major career failure and the first venture to bring him into the public eye. Born out of the worldwide shortage of edible oils and fats and Britain's own shortage of hard currency in the mid-1940s, the scheme saw Samuel uncharacteristically back a venture without sufficient investigation of the enormous risks involved. It all but collapsed in 1948, overburdened by soaring costs and local difficulties of labour procurement and transportation. Nevertheless, Samuel became chairman of UAC in 1953 and continued to establish new industries in west Africa. Under his direction UAC was transformed from a loss-making liability to a corporation with pre-tax profits of over &pound;14 million. Samuel's colleagues later praised his &#145;strong sense of justice&#146; and &#145;intensity of concentration&#146;, together with his &#145;great gift for developing subordinates, always seeking to give them confidence in their own powers&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 42).<br>
<br>Samuel died suddenly at his home, 25 Harley House, Regent's Park, Marylebone, London, on 25 February 1954, while still active in business life. He was survived by his wife.<br>
