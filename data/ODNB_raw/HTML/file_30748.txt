<span class="headword">Adams,  John Bodkin</span>  (1899&#150;1983), <span class="occ">general practitioner and forger</span>, was born on 20 January 1899 in Randalstown, co. Antrim, the elder son of Samuel Adams, watchmaker, and his wife, Ellen Bodkin (<i>d</i>. 1943), formerly of Desertmartin, co. Tyrone. The younger son was born in 1903 and died of pneumonia in 1916. Shortly after John was born the family moved to Ballinderry Bridge, co. Tyrone, where he attended a Methodist day school. The family were strictly religious and worshipped regularly at a Plymouth Brethren meeting-place where the father frequently preached. In 1911 the family moved to Coleraine, mainly to permit Adams to study at a local academy. He qualified in 1917 for Queen's College, Belfast, and graduated in 1921.<br>
<br>Adams became an ophthalmic house surgeon and casualty officer in Bristol Royal Infirmary, and then, responding to an advertisement for a &#145;Christian doctor assistant&#146;, joined an Eastbourne general practice. By relieving his partners of all night calls Adams was soon able to rent a modest house in Upperton Road and invite his mother to join him. The family reunion brought a revival of the religious pattern&#151;family prayers in the home and the advent of a <span class="roman">Bible</span> class for the Young Crusaders. When his partners retired Adams was able to slot into the &#145;good life&#146; of Eastbourne. He looked for a more suitable residence, and in 1930 for &pound;5000 he acquired Kent Lodge, a Victorian villa later to be valued in the doctor's estates at &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>The charm and ebullience of the soft-spoken, loquacious, teetotal bachelor quickly led Adams into the homes of the wealthy. By 1955 he had established himself in hunting and fishing circles. Yet he did not ignore his poor patients. On the other hand signs of his avaricious nature were beginning to appear, and rumours began. In 1935 Mrs Matilda Whitton, a 72-year-old patient, had left Adams &pound;3000. Relatives disputed the will but it was upheld by the courts. The rumours were revived between 1944 and 1955 during which period Adams received fourteen legacies totalling &pound;21,600 from octogenarian patients.<br>
<br>In July 1956 Mrs Gertrude Hullett, another of Adams's patients, died aged fifty. Heartbroken at the recent death of her husband, Mrs Hullett had often spoken to her solicitor and friends of her intention to take her own life. Adams was not present when she died and an autopsy established that she had swallowed a massive dose of barbiturates. The inquest jury found that she had committed suicide &#145;of her own free will&#146;, but in winding up the proceedings the coroner announced that the chief constable &#145;had invoked the aid of Scotland Yard to investigate certain deaths in the neighbourhood&#146;. Mrs Hullett's will disclosed that she had left Adams a Rolls-Royce car and had previously given him a cheque for &pound;1000 which he had &#145;specially cleared&#146;.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1956 Adams was arrested on a series of minor charges. Soon a further charge was added: &#145;That he did in November 1950 feloniously and with malice aforethought murder Edith Alice Morrell.&#146; Refused bail, Adams spent the next 111 days in prison. Meanwhile, the bodies of two other patients were exhumed but only one of them was in good enough condition to decide the cause of death, cerebral thrombosis, which was that given by Adams on the death certificate. At the committal proceedings the crown maintained it was essential that evidence regarding the deaths of Mr and Mrs Hullett should be given and despite defence objections the magistrates agreed&#151;a decision which in 1967 led to a change in the law.<br>
<br>Physically Adams seemed strong enough to withstand the trial but his facial appearance was against him. In good humour and smiling he resembled a genial Mr Pickwick but in sombre, grim moments he tended to appear quite capable of the crimes soon to be laid at his door. The trial was opened at the Old Bailey by the attorney-general, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller. He first called four nurses who gave their version from memory of the treatment of Mrs Morrell six years earlier. Then the defence, conducted by F. Geoffrey Lawrence, produced a trump card: the nurses' actual notebooks, which gave a very different version. The seams of the crown's case had started to come apart, and worse was to follow.<br>
<br>The chief medical witness, Arthur Henry Douthwaite, senior physician at Guy's Hospital, London, revised his theories in the witness box after admitting he had not seen the reports of three other doctors in Cheshire who had started Mrs Morrell on a course of heroin and morphia before she came under the care of Adams. Another expert, in answer to the judge, Patrick Devlin, said, &#145;I do not think it is possible absolutely to rule out a sudden catastrophic intervention by some natural cause&#146;. The defence, perhaps wisely, decided not to put the talkative Adams into the witness box. In his summing up Devlin told the jury that the case for the defence was manifestly a strong one. The jury found Adams not guilty.<br>
<br>On 26 July 1957 Adams appeared at Lewes assizes to answer the minor charges which remained on the calendar. Adams was charged with making a false statement on three cremation forms, drug offences, and forgery. He pleaded guilty and was fined &pound;2400. As a consequence he was struck off the medical register, but four years later his name was restored and he returned to a flock of private patients. He died on 4 July 1983 in Eastbourne General Hospital of heart failure, after breaking a leg. He left an estate of &pound;408,305, a sum which included substantial libel damages and the sale of Kent Lodge.<br>
