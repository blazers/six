</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cole,  William</span>  (1714&#150;1782), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at the King's Arms, Bourn Bridge, in the parish of Little Abington, Cambridgeshire, on 3 August 1714 and baptized on 15 August 1714, the only son of William Cole (1671/2&#150;1735), a prosperous gentleman farmer, and his third wife, Catherine (1682/3&#150;1725), widow of Charles Apthorp and daughter of Theophilus Tuer of Cambridge. His father married four times: besides two daughters by his first marriage, he had by his third marriage four children, of whom William was the eldest and only boy.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>Cole was sent to live with his maternal grandmother in Cambridge at a very early age and began his schooling at a dame-school there before attending a school at Linton kept by a nonconformist minister. Sundays were passed with a relative who belonged to the Church of England so that he was spared from attending dissenting services. After a short time with the Revd Robert Butts of Saffron Walden grammar school, he was entered at Eton College in 1726 and stayed there for six years; by his own account he was idle and unhappy, was often beaten, and once ran away, yet he formed a lifelong friendship with Horace Walpole. He was admitted as a sizar at Clare College, Cambridge, on 25 January 1733, but after inheriting a comfortable income and property on his father's death he became a fellow commoner. He developed a close attachment to Thomas Western of the same college and when Western left and married, Cole migrated to King's College, the natural home of old Etonians in the university, in June 1736. He took the degrees of BA in 1737 and MA in 1740.<br>
<br>Cole learned French at Cambridge from a Monsieur Herebert; in April 1736 he accompanied his elder half-brother Stephen Apthorp on a tour of Flanders, and in the following year while suffering from a bout of low spirits he travelled on his doctor's advice to Lisbon where he remained for six months, returning in May 1738. He made other visits to Normandy and again to Flanders, and in 1749 undertook a long tour to Scotland with friends and was made a freeman of the city of Glasgow. Thanks to his distant relative Lord Montfort of Horseheath he was made a deputy lieutenant of the county and justice of the peace. He kept rooms at King's until 1753 without holding a fellowship and had also a small country retreat at Haddenham in the Isle of Ely. His time during all these years was devoted to collecting historical information, especially concerning Cambridgeshire; he visited parish churches and libraries, transcribed inscriptions and registers, copied heraldic arms, and made abstracts from voluminous reading in both printed books and manuscripts. This vocation never deserted him. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in November 1747.<h2>
<a name="Thechurchandascholarlyretreat"></a>The church and a scholarly retreat</h2>On 25 December 1744 Cole was ordained deacon and acted for a short while as curate to Abraham Stokes, rector of Withersfield in Suffolk. He was admitted to priest's orders in April 1745 and was made chaplain to George, earl of Kinnoul, through the kindness of his son who was MP and recorder of Cambridge. He was collated to the rectory of Hornsey in Middlesex by Bishop Thomas Sherlock in 1749 and inducted on 25 November of that year. Cole was not comfortable with the living and when he found that he was expected to reside and to pay towards work on the rectory, he at once tried to resign, although he was not able to do so until 1751. He resided little if at all and employed a curate. At about this time he had the idea of living among the English Benedictines at Paris, without converting to Catholicism, since his only ambition was &#145;to live retiredly and quietly, and pretty much to myself, after the monkish manner&#146;  (Cole, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 142). The plan came to nothing when after strange negotiations in 1753 Cole was presented to the rectory of Bletchley in Buckinghamshire by Browne Willis, the eccentric antiquary. He remained there for fourteen years.<br>
<br>Cole did make another trip to France to meet Walpole in Paris from October to December 1765 and began to keep a full and characteristic diary that he continued until August 1770. He again wished to retire abroad, despite Walpole's warning that if he did so his goods, including his collections, might be seized for the crown if he died in France. Such a prospect was daunting. His volumes were, he wrote to Walpole (17 March 1765):<blockquote>my only delight&#151;they are my wife and children&#151;they have been in short, my whole employ and amusement for these twenty or thirty years; and though I really and sincerely think the greatest part of them stuff and trash, and deserve no other treatment than the fire, yet the collections which I have made towards an &#145;History of Cambridgeshire&#146;, the chief points in view of them, with an oblique or transient view of an &#145;Athenae Cantabrigienses&#146;, will be of singular use to any one who will have more patience and perseverance than I am master of to put the materials together. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 1.92)</blockquote>The trip to Paris did not tempt Cole to move; too many aspects of French life from the habits of the people to what he considered irreligious thinking offended him. He had, however, many close Catholic friends such as Alban Butler and time after time in his writings he insisted robustly that the Church of England had more to fear from its own temporizing and the influence of dissent, to which he had a rooted aversion, than from Roman Catholicism, to which he was as strongly attracted. He believed he had little of a priestly calling, and yet performed his duties conscientiously according to his lights and the standards of the times, was hospitable and charitable, and did not forget the dignity of his office and the respect due to it. Although a high tory by principle he took little part in politics lest they should estrange him from his friends, claiming that &#145;I have all my life lived and acted with the Whigs, who were my friends, though perhaps might not always wish them success&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 2.86). His inherited means allowed a measure of independence and aloofness from preferment-hunting, though he sometimes worried about his income and was not rich when he died.<br>
<br>Cole did not approve of a married clergy and his relations with women were those of a confirmed bachelor, sociable enough and occasionally mildly flirtatious within safe limits, for although he could appraise a good-looking woman, there is no trace of his desiring a close or physical intimacy with any. His deep friendships were with men, and his domestic comfort and routine were attended to by several servants of whom the chief was Tom Wood, the general factotum of the household, who entered his service as a boy about 1760 and remained with his master until he died. Cole's affection for and care of him are plain in his diary. Tom was kept busy and was occasionally scolded, but his health and education were not neglected. He was one of Cole's executors and was remembered in his will.<br>
<br>Cole resigned the living at Bletchley as a point of honour in 1767 in favour of Willis's grandson, and after weighing several alternatives accepted the curacy of Waterbeach and a meagre income of &pound;20 a year from his friend and fellow antiquary Robert Masters. Both had strong characters and were soon at loggerheads so that, using the excuse of the wetness of the place, Cole moved in 1770 to Milton 3 miles from Cambridge where he remained until his death, declining other offers of a church living until he was presented by Eton College to the vicarage of Burnham in Buckinghamshire. He was instituted there on 10 June 1774 but continued to live at Milton.<h2>
<a name="Antiquarianstudies"></a>Antiquarian studies</h2>Cole's return to Cambridgeshire in 1767 and his hasty resignation from the curacy at Waterbeach allowed him to resume his studies with increased zeal. He possessed over fifty large volumes of his collections when he settled at Milton and compiled as many more before the end of his life. He continued to add to his own stores and to annotate and cross-reference what he had written earlier, and make the contents of his books accessible through a series of indexes. Besides armorial bearings his collections contain many sketches of churches and other buildings, crudely but faithfully drawn. He was entrusted with unique manuscripts to study at home, as, for example, Thomas Baker's history of St John's College which he transcribed and annotated in only six weeks during 1777. His correspondence was vast and, since he kept copies of letters sent and received, his importance in supplying information and corrections for works published or in progress is evident and considerable. There was little that did not interest him, but Roman Britain did not. Except when prevented by illness he also regularly met resident Cambridge scholars such as Richard Farmer, master of Emmanuel College, and James Essex, the preferred architect of Georgian Cambridge. He was at the centre of a web of scholarly communication and in his own line was one of the most learned men of the eighteenth century and the most industrious historian that Cambridgeshire had before William Mortlock Palmer in the twentieth century. There can have been few days when he did not put pen to paper and his speed, accuracy, and legibility are remarkable. Among those with whom he corresponded and exchanged intelligence and favours were Horace Walpole, Thomas Gray, Michael Lort, Richard Gough, Thomas Pennant, Thomas Phillips, James Granger, and John Nichols. He was a member of the Benedictines, a group of antiquaries connected with Corpus Christi College, which included James Nasmith and Robert Masters.<br>
<br>A disinclination to publish was one of Cole's marked idiosyncrasies. He defended it on the ground that in future others would benefit &#145;who have not had the drudgery to collect, but have all ready to their hands&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 1.vi). His materials have been routinely consulted and used (not always with acknowledgement) by historians, and they remain of value especially as a witness to lost records and buildings and as a repository of genealogical facts. He revised Browne Willis's manuscript history of two Buckinghamshire hundreds, as their author had asked, but seems to have made no attempt to print it, and shortly before his own death intended to give it to John Nichols. He wrote three short pieces in volume 47 of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1777)&#151;on corrections to Hawkins's <span class="italic">History of Music</span>, &#145;Origin of &#147;Old Nick&#148;&#146;, and &#145;Saint whose emblems are naked boys in a tub&#146;&#151;and &#145;Some observations on the horns given by Henry I to the cathedral of Carlisle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 5, 1779, 340&#150;45). Cole often aided others in their researches. His earliest contribution appears to have been notes for Zachary Grey's edition of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> in the 1740s; he gave A. C. Ducarel suggestions for his <span class="italic">Tour through Normandy</span> (1754) and a large amount of material for his unpublished &#145;Account of Doctors' Commons&#146;. The principal authors whom he helped were James Bentham, for his <span class="italic">History of Ely Cathedral</span> (1771), James Granger, for his <span class="italic">Biographical History of England</span> (1775), Richard Gough, for his <span class="italic">British Topography</span> (1780) and other works, and John Nichols, for many of his works. He supplied an account of the school of Pythagoras at Cambridge to Francis Grose for his <span class="italic">Antiquities of England and Wales</span> and materials for several of Walpole's books, especially the second edition of his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Paintings in England</span>. A list of works to which Cole contributed may be found in the Yale edition of his letters to Walpole  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 2.376&#150;7), to which should be added his notes on Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> which were used by Philip Bliss for his edition of 1813.<br>
<br>While free in sharing his knowledge Cole was anxious that few should examine his manuscripts; an exception was Walpole, to whom he lent the four volumes of his &#145;History of King's College&#146; in 1777 with a warning that &#145;through life, I have never disguised artfully my opinions, and as my books were my trusty friends who had engaged never to speak till twenty years after my departure, I always without guile entrusted them with my most secret thoughts&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 2.42). He was troubled to know where to leave his manuscripts and changed his mind more than once. To give them to King's College would be like throwing them in a horse-pond since its members had only contempt for non-classical studies. In the end, in his will written four days before his death, he bequeathed them all to the British Museum with the stipulation that they were not to be looked into for twenty years after his death. His loose papers and letters were also to be gathered up, for:<blockquote>such papers are valuable when time has impressed his fingers on them. It is also my wish that no persons except my executors may be admitted into my study until all the letters and loose papers are sorted and locked up with my manuscripts. (Palmer, <span class="italic">William Cole</span>, 29)</blockquote>Cole's manuscripts form a discontinuous series of 115 large volumes among the additional manuscripts of the British Library. An official catalogue was printed in 1849, and an alphabetical index of their contents, with curious juxtapositions, was published in 1912 by G. J. Gray. Volume 17, thought to contain a history of Queens' College, Cambridge, is missing, and there are other strays, such as a history of the parish of Fen Ditton now in Cambridge University Library, and a ten-page index to the life compiled by Gray in a fit of the gout on 16 May 1775 is now at Yale. Three catalogues of his library exist. He parted with about six hundred printed books, mostly classics and divinity, to a London bookseller, Benjamin White, when he left Bletchley in 1767; the remainder were dispersed by White after Cole's death intermixed with those of another collector, Charles Hedges. The sale catalogue of their combined libraries and other materials, dated February 1784, records almost 9000 volumes. Some of Cole's books were annotated by him and survive in the British Library and elsewhere. His prints, of which there were more than three thousand, were also dispersed together with the collection of stained glass which he built up to be one of the largest in private hands.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>From 1769 Cole was increasingly a martyr to gout and other ailments, badly overweight for his medium height, and lame. At the end of 1782 he became seriously ill and died on 16 December in Milton. He was buried on 22 December in St Clement's Church in Cambridge, his grandmother's place of worship, and left money towards the building of the spire. When it was done almost forty years later the words &#145;Deum Cole&#146; were displayed on it; they were wrongly said to have been his motto.<br>
<br>Cole's reputation has undergone several changes. Among many of his contemporaries he was well regarded for his learning, though they were alive to his singularities and prejudices which he took no trouble to disguise. &#145;With all his oddities&#146;, Michael Lort wrote just after his death, &#145;he was a worthy and valuable man&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 16.201). The terms of his will naturally caused alarm and defensiveness. Robert Masters, who did not live to see the manuscripts opened, supposed that the blending of personal scandal with his other collections would probably cause his work to sink into oblivion. Egerton Brydges, who printed extracts from Cole in his <span class="italic">Restituta</span>, described him as a known &#145;gossip&#146; many of whose biographical notes &#145;consist of scarcely any thing but tattle&#146;  (Brydges, 4.242). Access to his original manuscripts after 1802 and the publication of parts of his correspondence, especially by John Nichols in <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> and <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, revealed Cole's foibles and inconsistencies plainly and made him at once a figure of fun and morally reprehensible by the severer standards and increasing delicacies of the nineteenth century. Isaac D'Israeli patronized him; J. J. Smith observed that &#145;his style is rude and free to licentiousness&#146;  (Smith, 1.153); to C. H. Cooper he had the industry of Anthony Wood &#145;without his common sense&#146; and his prejudices &#145;are simply ridiculous&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 1.vi). A later generation observed more favourably how &#145;he took a lively interest in all that was passing around him&#146; and left &#145;an invaluable storehouse of information&#146;  (Willis and Clark, 1.xcvi). The publication of two volumes of his diaries in 1931, edited by F. G. Stokes and with introductions by Helen Waddell, brought Cole before a much wider public who found their vivid and immediate manner attractive. They exemplify and justify Cole's own view that &#145;anecdotes of men of learning and character, notices of customs and manners, are not only amusing, but instructive of the usages of early ages, and of our country and ancestors&#146;  (Brydges, 3.39). W. M. Palmer's <span class="italic">William Cole of Milton</span> (1935), which includes an edition of Cole's parochial notes and church drawings for Cambridgeshire, and two elaborate volumes of Walpole's correspondence with Cole issued by the University of Yale in 1937 were well received, and Virginia Woolf took Cole and Walpole as the subject of an essay which has been reprinted several times. Cole became not simply of interest to academic scholarship and historiography: because of his individual qualities and distinctive expression he is numbered among the more entertaining and informative English letter writers and diarists. Indeed in a series of pastiche letters in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> between 1946 and 1948 he was reborn as a fictional character.<br>
