<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Starkie,  Enid Mary</span>  (1897&#150;1970), <span class="occ">French scholar</span>, was born on 18 August 1897 in Dublin, the daughter of the Rt Hon. William Joseph Myles Starkie (1860&#150;1920), classical scholar and last resident commissioner of national education in Ireland under British rule, and his wife, May (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1876), daughter of Cornelius Walsh, a Dublin solicitor. She had three younger sisters and two brothers, one of whom died in infancy; she was particularly close to her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75075/', "Walter Fitzwilliam Starkie (1894&#150;1976)")</script>, who became a professor in Dublin and an authority on Spanish literature and Gypsy life. She herself, while spending most of her adult life in England, remained very conscious of her &#145;wild&#146; Irishness.<br>
<br>Starkie's life up to 1921 is evoked, in its pleasures and its unhappiness, in her memoir <span class="italic">A Lady's Child</span> (1941). Much of the unhappiness was caused by a French governess, who nevertheless gave her an early acquaintance with the French culture she came to love. She then attended Alexandra School and Alexandra College in Dublin. Her youthful life was marked by a passion for music (which she considered as a career) and by a period of religious fervour. The later fading of her faith left a strong spiritual need, and she sometimes described herself as a &#145;bad Catholic&#146;. In her adolescent years, however, she discovered in Andr&eacute; Gide's <span class="italic">Nourritures terrestres</span> the &#145;key of the gate of freedom&#146; and &#145;an explanation of [my] revolt and its justification&#146;  (Starkie, 227).<br>
<br>The freedom and revolt were in evidence when in 1916 Starkie went to Somerville College, Oxford, with an open scholarship in modern languages. Her student years were marked by spiritual and intellectual exploration, and by the cultivation of a flamboyant lifestyle which fascinated her contemporaries and brought her into conflict with her parents. She graduated with first-class honours in 1920.<br>
<br>After a brief period as a schoolteacher, Starkie went to Paris to study for a doctorate at the Sorbonne in 1921. After her father's death in 1920, a financial crisis had hit her family, and she lived in great poverty, taking menial jobs to survive, but made many valuable friends, notably the writer Charles Du Bos. She began a thesis on the Belgian poet Verhaeren, which she published and defended successfully in 1927; <span class="italic">Les sources du lyrisme dans la po&eacute;sie d'&Eacute;mile Verhaeren</span> was crowned by the French Academy and won the prix Narcisse Michaut.<br>
<br>From 1925 to 1928 Starkie lectured at the University College of the South-West, Exeter. At this time she wrote an autobiographical novel (never published) and experienced her first major love affair. She was to have a number of intense, often unhappy, relationships with both men and women, and was in the 1920s briefly engaged to a French diplomatist, but broke off the engagement. She never married.<br>
<br>In 1928 Starkie was appointed the first Sarah Smithson lecturer in French literature at Somerville. Although she often expressed impatience with Oxford and did not feel at home in the academic world, she remained there for the rest of her career, becoming a fellow of Somerville in 1934 and university reader in French literature in 1946. In 1939 she was awarded the first DLitt to be given in her faculty. Subsequently she was elected a member of the Irish Academy of Letters and fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and received honorary degrees from Trinity College, Dublin, and the universities of Exeter and Aix-en-Provence.<br>
<br>At different times Starkie was a visiting professor or guest lecturer in universities in America and Europe. In Oxford, she played an active part in university life and society, bringing Gide on a memorable lecture visit, obtaining an honorary degree for Jean Cocteau, and campaigning successfully on behalf of Cecil Day Lewis, W. H. Auden, and Edmund Blunden for the chair of poetry, to which she herself twice failed to be elected.<br>
<br>Although Starkie once wrote to a friend: &#145;I've never felt any desire to teach anyone anything&#146;  (Richardson, 93), she inspired great affection in some of her pupils, whom she liked to treat as friends. She led a very sociable life and was a striking presence, both in her mercurial and passionate character and in her unorthodox appearance. Her biographer Joanna Richardson saw her as &#145;a small, electric figure in scarlet and royal blue, a voluble, flamboyant humming bird&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 14 Oct 1956). She normally wore reefer jackets, trousers, and a matelot cap, but would dress splendidly on formal occasions, and was a stickler for etiquette. Her room was gorgeously decorated, and while retaining the frugal habits she had acquired in Paris, she was a connoisseur of wine.<br>
<br>Starkie's teaching and writing were marked by her love of France and French culture. Although students were surprised by her disregard for French pronunciation, she spoke and wrote the language fluently and loved being in France, which she described in <span class="italic">From Gautier to Eliot: the Influence of France on English Literature, 1851&#150;1939</span> (1960) as &#145;the repository of the great general ideas by which man lives&#146;  (p. 213). Her services to France were rewarded when she was appointed chevalier (1948) and officier (1958) in the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>Starkie valued in French literature the maturity and honesty with which writers such as Pascal, Baudelaire, or Gide faced the unpalatable truths of human life. Her writings were devoted to understanding the inner struggles and achievements of such writers. She was not greatly concerned with specifically literary questions; her aim was rather to find the vital thread linking the inner life of a writer with the work. Her two most influential books were both rewritten as she came nearer to the understanding she was seeking. <span class="italic">Baudelaire</span>, written with great empathy and stressing the spiritual quest at the heart of the poet's life, was sceptically received in 1933, but her argument had come to command general acceptance when a new version appeared in 1957.<br>
<br>Starkie was the first person to lecture in Oxford on both Baudelaire and Rimbaud. Her <span class="italic">Arthur Rimbaud</span> (1938, 1947, 1961), again the life of a <i>po&egrave;te maudit</i>, had its starting point in early archival work on Rimbaud's African years (<span class="italic">Rimbaud in Abyssinia</span>, 1938), and was modified to record her growing conviction of the importance of magic and alchemy for the young poet. While writing with sympathy for Rimbaud's rebellious impulses, she admired him less than Baudelaire and presented his abandonment of literature as a tragic mistake.<br>
<br>In addition to these major works, Starkie wrote shorter studies on the eccentric romantic Petrus Borel, and on Andr&eacute; Gide. In the last ten years of her life, however, she devoted her efforts to Flaubert. <span class="italic">Flaubert: the Making of a Master</span> (1967) is a comprehensive account of the early years of the novelist, up to <span class="italic">Madame Bovary</span>; whereas the posthumous <span class="italic">Flaubert the Master</span> (1971) is a rather less successful study of the later works.<br>
<br>The two Flaubert studies were written under the shadow of illness. In 1965 Starkie was diagnosed as suffering from lung cancer, and knew that she might not have long to live. She resigned her readership, but continued to write, to lecture, and to travel (she was visiting professor at Columbia University during the student rebellions of 1968). In 1967 she was appointed CBE. She died in Oxford (where her home was 23 Walton Street) on 22 April 1970.<br>
