<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skene, Sir  John, of Curriehill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1617), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was the sixth son of James Skene in Bandodle (killed at Pinkie, 10 September 1547) and his wife, Janet, daughter of Robert Lumsden of Cushnie. His father was the second son of Alexander, ninth laird of Skene (1485&#150;1507), and progenitor of the Skenes of Westercorse and Ramore. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25675/', "Gilbert Skeyne (c.1522&#150;1599)")</script>, physician, was his brother. He may have been at Aberdeen grammar school in 1549, and was thereafter at King's College, Aberdeen. In 1556 he incorporated at St Mary's College, St Andrews, where he was a regent in 1565. He spent seven years in Europe (<i>c</i>.1567&#150;1574), studying law in Paris and visiting Switzerland, Poland, and Scandinavia before settling in Germany, at the University of Wittenberg. It was probably through his travels that he became, according to James VI, fluent in &#145;the Dutch and Latin tongues, with great acquaintance with sundry princes in Germany, and the chief learned men about the princes there&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1589&#150;93</i>, 305).<br>
<br>After returning to Scotland, Skene was admitted as an advocate on 19 March 1575. He was then recruited by Regent Morton to assist with a project for reviewing the laws of Scotland. In 1577 Morton granted him a pension from the revenues of Arbroath Abbey, to compensate for loss of his legal practice, confirmed by James VI in 1578 and 1579. As a &#145;disciple&#146; of Sir James Balfour, Skene probably assisted in the compilation of the latter's <span class="italic">Practicks</span>. When Balfour went into exile in 1579, Skene seems to have expanded his own legal practice, appearing in cases before the privy council. In 1581 the general assembly of the kirk suggested his appointment as procurator for certain ministers and in 1589 he was included in a commission to consult as to measures for &#145;the weal of the kirk in so dangerous a time&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.4).<br>
<br>James VI initially objected to Skene's inclusion in the embassy to Denmark in 1589 for negotiating his marriage, because &#145;ther were many better lawers&#146;, but was assured by Sir James Melville that Skene &#145;was best acquanted with the conditions of the Germanes, and culd mak them lang harrangues in Latin, and was a gud trew stout man lyk a Dutche man&#146;  (Melville, 366). In 1590 James sent him on an extended diplomatic mission to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, where he tried to interest the rulers in supporting plans for a league against Spain. On his return to Scotland, he resumed his duties as joint lord advocate, to which he had been appointed on 20 August 1590.<br>
<br>According to Scot of Scotstarvet, Skene owed his appointment as clerk register on 19 September 1594 to his brother-in-law Walter Stewart, Lord Blantyre. Shortly afterwards, on 30 November 1594, he was appointed a lord of session. As clerk register he inventoried the exchequer records and used them to compile a list of crown property rights that had been lost during royal minorities. From January 1596 he was one of the &#145;Octavians&#146;, the eight commissioners of exchequer, given sweeping powers to overhaul the royal finances. When James VI's impatience with financial restraints and their own growing unpopularity forced the Octavians to resign in January 1597, all were reappointed, but the enlarged commission had more limited powers and was effectively controlled by Blantyre as treasurer. An act of parliament of June 1598 prohibiting permanent commissions of exchequer brought an end to this attempt at financial reform. About ten years later Skene set out a similar programme in his &#145;Proposals anent the order of the Checker&#146;, produced for the then lord treasurer, George Home, earl of Dunbar.<br>
<br>Skene's membership of a commission appointed in 1592 to review and print acts of parliament and other laws resulted in the publication in 1597 of <span class="italic">The Lawes and Actes of Parliament</span>, containing post-1424 statutes. His <span class="italic">De verborum significatione</span> (1597), the first published dictionary of Scots law, drew extensively on earlier and non-statutory sources. A second edition of this rather idiosyncratic compilation appeared in 1599, the only new entry being a dissertation on the names of days of the week. According to his assistant Habakkuk Bisset, Skene also prepared a third, unpublished, edition.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">De verborum</span>'s full title, &#145;The exposition of the termes and difficill wordes conteined in the four buikes of <i>Regiam majestatem</i>&#146;, indicates that Skene was already engrossed in the task that was to occupy him for the next ten years. However, the citations in <span class="italic">De verborum</span> indicate that the text of <span class="italic">Regiam</span> he was using differed from the one eventually published. A revised text of 1601&#150;2 bears extensive annotations, some showing his awareness of the relationship between <span class="italic">Regiam</span> and <span class="italic">Glanvill</span>, which also excited interest among English lawyers in the context of proposals for a legal union of England and Scotland after 1603. In later revisions Skene brought in a fuller range of references to <span class="italic">Glanvill</span>. By 1607 he was able to lay a finished text before the privy council, which recommended to the king that, as Skene's estate was not equal to his wit, genius, and literature, the work should be printed at public expense, a tax being levied on judges and members of the estates to defray the cost. The volume finally appeared in 1609 in two versions: &#145;the one in Latyne for the benefyte of strangearis, the uther in Scottishe language for the use of subjectis of the countrey&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 8.358). Both included legal texts or statutes attributed to monarchs from Malcolm II to Robert III. An edition of the Latin version was published in London in 1613, differing only in its title-page.<br>
<br>Skene's editorial methods have been criticized severely by later writers, notably his uncritical acceptance of the authenticity of <span class="italic">Regiam</span>, in which he followed legal tradition going back at least two centuries. Its relationship to <span class="italic">Glanvill</span> seems to have reinforced his conviction that it was authentic legislation of David I, of which <span class="italic">Glanvill</span> was merely a later English adaptation, whereas Sir Thomas Craig dismissed it as the work of a plagiarist. Skene was, however, fully aware of the many serious discrepancies among the manuscript sources available to him, as shown by his comment &#145;I fell into an Augean stable, that not even the labour of Hercules can cleanse or purge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Regiam majestatem</span>, Latin preface). Drastic editing produced texts that were logical by his own standards, while his notes showed awareness of parallels in English and civil law. He deserves credit, at least, for providing lawyers with a printed text that answered contemporary needs. Moreover the English version of <span class="italic">Regiam</span> contained two treatises that were genuinely innovative. The first, &#145;Ane short form of proces presentlie used and observed before the Lords of Counsell and session&#146;, was the first published guide to Scottish court procedure, drawing upon Roman law, as well as native sources. Habakkuk Bisset's <span class="italic">Rolment of Courtis</span> is a revised and expanded version, using Skene's own emendations of the original. The second, &#145;Of crimes and judges, in criminall causes, conforme to the lawes of the realme&#146;, is a brief, well-planned exposition of different types of crime and the various judges entitled to try them.<br>
<br>Skene, who had been knighted in 1604, had combined his editorial work with involvement in public business. His appointment as a commissioner for negotiating the proposed union with England in 1604 may be the context for his call to the English bar (Middle Temple) in the following year. He served on several other commissions, including one for visiting the University of St Andrews in 1609.<br>
<br>According to Scot of Scotstarvet, Skene's editions of the acts of parliament and <span class="italic">Regiam</span> brought him &#145;a great deal of money from the country; for all heritors of land were obliged to buy them, but it did little good; for albeit he lived many years in the place, yet did he purchase but few lands&#146;  (Scot, 99). He did not acquire Curriehill, Edinburghshire, until 1604, the year in which he made a first move to ensure his eldest son's succession to the office of clerk register. Although <a href="#cosubject_25667">James Skene's [<i>see below</i>]</a> commission was not recorded, it evidently involved some form of joint tenure with his father, who also made over to him the minor office of clerk of the bills in 1608. Finally in April 1612 Skene &#145;being grown in age and infirmity&#146; dispatched James to court &#145;with a demission of the place but with a charge not to use it unless he found the king willing to admit him&#146;. James, however, &#145;abused by some politick wits&#146; accepted the lesser position of an ordinary lord of session  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 3.517). This was attributed to the machinations of Sir Thomas Hamilton, the lord advocate, who became clerk register but quickly exchanged the post for that of secretary of state, his real objective. The incident caused an estrangement between father and son, said to have been healed only by the king's personal intervention. Skene's withdrawal from public life ended with his reappointment to the council in February 1614, from which he retired finally in June 1616.<br>
<br>Skene died on 16 March 1617 and was buried in the Greyfriars' Kirk, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife, Helen Somerville (<i>d</i>. in or after 1625), eldest daughter of Sir John Somerville of Camnethan, whom he had married in 1577. They had four sons and four daughters. He bequeathed her the unsold stocks of <span class="italic">Regiam</span> and the rest of his books. His library, including a number of incunabula, survived at Mar Lodge, Braemar, into the 1920s but was subsequently dispersed.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25667"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Skene of Curriehill</span>, first baronet  (1578/9&#150;1633), <span class="occ">judge</span>, the eldest son of Sir John Skene, was admitted advocate in 1603 and was joint clerk register with his father from 1604 to 1612 and clerk of the bills between 1608 and 1614. Appointed a lord of session in 1612, he was promoted to lord president in 1626. He was a privy councillor from 1616 to 1626, and was created a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1628. On 7 December 1603 he married Janet, daughter of Sir John Johnston of Hilton and Sheen, who survived him. They had eight sons, six of whom died young, and three daughters. Sir James Skene died on 15 October 1633, aged fifty-four, and was buried beside his father.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25670"></a><span class="headword">John Skene of Hallyards</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1644)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son of Sir John, was appointed by him keeper of the registers of hornings and inhibitions for life, but in August 1612 the privy council found his gift to be invalid. He succeeded his brother as clerk of the bills in 1614 and by 1618 was a principal clerk of session. On 29 June 1603 he married Alison, sister of William Rigg of Aithernie, who predeceased him; they had three sons and six daughters. The Skene manuscript of 1615&#150;35, containing tunes, chiefly Scottish, arranged for the lute, is partly attributed to him. He died in December 1644.<br>
