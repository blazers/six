<span class="headword">Upton,  Charles Barnes</span>  (1831&#150;1920), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and tutor</span>, was born on 19 November 1831 at Portsea in Hampshire, son of Henry Upton, a bookbinder. His early education was undertaken by Dr J. R. Beard, his uncle, at his school in Manchester. In September 1853, at the age of twenty-one, Upton was enrolled at Manchester New College, which had just moved from Manchester to Gordon Square in London. Here he studied for the Unitarian ministry, taking his BA degree at the University of London in 1857. The following year he won a Hibbert scholarship which enabled him to continue his studies after completing his ministerial training and to gain a BSc in 1862. On 11 July 1863 he married Louisa, daughter of Charles Elcock, a captain in the merchant navy. Although they had no children, they enjoyed thirty-four years of happily married life. In 1867 he received an invitation to become the minister of the Ancient Chapel at Toxteth Park in Liverpool, where he remained until 1875, when he was invited back to his old college as professor of philosophy to work alongside James Martineau, the principal. When Manchester College was relocated to Oxford in 1889 he moved with it, and remained on the staff until his retirement in 1903.<br>
<br>Upton was not an original philosopher, but he was a competent teacher and perceptive reviewer, whose main achievement was to popularize the philosophy of James Martineau, his former tutor and colleague. His major work was his contribution to the <span class="italic">Life and Letters of James Martineau</span> (1902), which he wrote with James Drummond. Upton's section of this book was later published separately under the title <span class="italic">Dr Martineau's Philosophy</span> (1905). This was an able work which did justice to a complex philosopher. His other major work was the publication of his Hibbert lectures delivered in 1893, <span class="italic">The Bases of Religious Belief</span>. Here again he acknowledged his dependence upon Martineau and dedicated the book to him. He strongly argued in this work for the doctrine of human freedom, which was a theme constantly found in his lectures and other writings.<br>
<br>Upton was a gentle and quiet man, who read widely and spent much time as a conscientious teacher, a preacher in the college chapel, and a writer of reviews for <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, the Unitarian newspaper. He was a sociable person who enjoyed company and receiving guests, both friends and former students, at his home, St George's, Littlemore, which had been the residence of John Henry Newman after he resigned from the living of St Mary's. Upton died in his home on 21 November 1920. His chief interest outside his academic work was the cultivation of fruit trees in his garden at Littlemore. There is a fine portrait of him by Leslie Brooke in the small dining-room at Manchester College, which captures something of his unselfish and loving character. There is also a memorial plaque to him in the college chapel.<br>
