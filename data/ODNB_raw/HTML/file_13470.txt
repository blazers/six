</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hogg,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was the second among the four children of Robert Hogg (<i>c</i>.1729&#150;1820), shepherd and farmer, and Margaret Laidlaw (1730&#150;1813). He was born in Selkirkshire at the farm of Ettrick Hall (also known as Ettrickhill). The farm lay in the valley of the River Ettrick, at the heart of Ettrick Forest, one of the ancient Scottish royal hunting grounds. By Hogg's time, however, the Scottish court had long since departed to London and the royal forest had dwindled to a remote, backward sheep-farming district. Nevertheless Ettrick remained a rich storehouse of oral tradition in story and song, and Hogg's mother's family were noted tradition-bearers. <h2>
<a name="Childhoodandeducation"></a>Childhood and education</h2>For much of his life Hogg believed that he was born on 25 January 1772. He took great pride in sharing the birthday of Robert Burns; indeed there is much evidence that he saw his life's work in terms of being Burns's successor. However, the parish register of Ettrick records Hogg's baptism at Ettrick church on 9 December 1770, a fact that he discovered with disappointment during his later years. <br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Memoir of the Author's Life</span> Hogg gives an account of his childhood and family background. His father &#145;was bred to the occupation of a shepherd&#146; but by the time of his marriage in May 1765 he had saved enough money to take the lease of the farms at Ettrick House and Ettrick Hall. He began to deal in sheep, buying large numbers and driving them to English and Scottish markets. However:<blockquote>owing to a great fall in the price of sheep, and the absconding of his principal debtor, he was ruined, became bankrupt, every thing was sold by auction, and my parents were turned out of doors without a farthing in the world.</blockquote>Hogg was six at the time, and the &#145;distressed and destitute condition&#146; of his parents remained vivid in his memory. The &#145;late worthy Mr. Brydon, of Crosslee&#146;, came to the family's rescue, temporarily at least, when he took &#145;a short lease of the farm of Ettrick House&#146; and employed Robert Hogg as his shepherd there  (<span class="italic">Memoir of the Author's Life</span>, 4&#150;5). A monument dating from 1898 now marks the site of Hogg's birthplace at Ettrick Hall. <br>
<br>Robert Hogg's bankruptcy cut short the formal schooling of his children, and the young James for the remainder of his childhood had to earn his keep by doing menial work (herding cows and the like) on various local farms. The <span class="italic">Memoir of the Author's Life</span> gives a brief and understated account of the hardships involved. Being &#145;exceedingly bare of shirts&#146; Hogg after a time gave up &#145;wearing them altogether&#146;. He recalled that he &#145;certainly made a very grotesque figure&#146;, particularly as he &#145;could never induce my trews, or lower vestments, to keep up to their proper sphere, there being no braces in those days&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir of the Author's Life</span>, 7). At fourteen he bought a violin with money he had saved from his wages. In the evenings, after work, he would spend &#145;an hour or two &hellip; sawing over my favourite old Scottish tunes&#146;  (ibid.). When he reached his late teens he graduated to the responsible work of shepherding; this increase in his status ensured that he had the time to begin to master once again the long-neglected skill of reading. <h2>
<a name="JamiethePoeter17901810"></a>Jamie the Poeter, 1790&#150;1810</h2>In 1790 Hogg found work as a shepherd at Blackhouse Farm in the Yarrow valley in Ettrick Forest. He remained there for ten years, during which time he began a lifelong friendship with his employer's son William Laidlaw (later the manager of Sir Walter Scott's Abbotsford estate). At Blackhouse, Hogg had free access to a wide selection of books, and he read voraciously. He also began to write poems, plays, and songs. These found a ready audience in Ettrick, earning him the local nickname Jamie the Poeter. Hogg became a published writer in 1794, when &#145;The Mistakes of a Night&#146;, a vigorous, hilarious, and uninhibited poem of rural courtship, appeared in the October number of the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. <br>
<br>The happy years at Blackhouse came to an end in 1800, when, following his brother's marriage, Hogg moved to Ettrick House to assist his father, who was now just over seventy. About the beginning of the nineteenth century sheep-farming was expanding rapidly in the Scottish highlands in the wake of the clearances. With a view to turning his sheep-farming skills to good account Hogg gave serious consideration to moving to the highlands with his elderly parents, and about this time he made a series of summer journeys to the area. In 1804 he made arrangements for a move to Harris, to take over a large sheep farm. His plans reached an advanced stage but did not come to fruition, and involved him in considerable financial loss. However, Hogg published accounts of his various highland journeys of the early 1800s, and he retained a lively and well-informed interest in highland culture throughout the remainder of his life. <br>
<br>Hogg's first book, <span class="italic">Scottish Pastorals</span> (a short collection of poems), was published in Edinburgh in 1801 but attracted little attention. Nevertheless from this time onwards Hogg regularly had material accepted for publication in magazines. Through William Laidlaw he was also helping to provide assistance in collecting traditional ballads for the third volume of Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span> (1803), and in 1802 Laidlaw was instrumental in setting up a meeting in Ettrick between Hogg and Scott. A friendship developed that was to last until Scott's death in 1832. <br>
<br>After the failure of the projected move to Harris in 1804, Hogg obtained work as a shepherd in Dumfriesshire, in south-west Scotland, an area in which Burns had spent the final years of his life. Indeed, while living in Dumfriesshire, Hogg made the acquaintance of Jean Armour, Burns's widow. With Scott's encouragement two books by Hogg appeared in 1807. One was <span class="italic">The Mountain Bard</span>, a collection of poems in the manner of the ballads of <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span>, and the other was <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Guide: being a Practical Treatise on the Diseases of Sheep</span>. Both were well received, and Hogg used the substantial proceeds to set himself up as a sheep-farmer in Dumfriesshire. <br>
<br>Hogg's letters indicate that he fathered at least one illegitimate child at this stage in his life. His Dumfriesshire years were spent in an area that had been part of the heartland of the covenanters in the religious wars of the seventeenth century, and as a result Dumfriesshire scenes often surface in his stories of the covenanters and of the supernatural. This period of his life produced lasting friendships, for example, with the poet Allan Cunningham, but his Dumfriesshire farming ventures did not prosper. Bankruptcy followed, and in 1810 he set out for Edinburgh in an attempt to establish himself as a professional writer. He was by then forty years old. <h2>
<a name="AnEdinburghpoet18101817"></a>An Edinburgh poet, 1810&#150;1817</h2>Having arrived in Edinburgh with no writings to hand but some of his old songs, Hogg duly prepared <span class="italic">The Forest Minstrel</span> (a collection of songs) for publication. This book appeared in 1810, but sold badly. The aspiring professional writer found that while periodicals were perfectly willing to publish his writings payment was sparse. Profits seemed to go to the proprietors of the periodicals rather than the authors, so Hogg took the bold but logical step of setting up his own weekly paper. Named <span class="italic">The Spy</span>, it was produced on a shoestring and was largely written by Hogg himself. A variety of material, including essays, prose fiction, and poetry, was published during its run, from 1 September 1810 to 24 August 1811. <span class="italic">The Spy</span> foundered, however, because of a perception among its readers that it lacked what was called &#145;delicacy&#146;; that is to say it did not exhibit enough discretion and restraint in dealing with subjects such as extra-marital sex. <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Spy</span> nevertheless had various supporters, including James Gray of the Edinburgh high school, with whom Hogg shared Dumfriesshire links. Through Gray, Hogg established contacts with radical whig political circles in Edinburgh. In the early 1810s he also became actively involved in &#145;the Forum&#146;, a public debating club that attracted large paying audiences, often several hundred strong; indeed, Hogg for a time received a small salary as secretary of the Forum. He also got to know Dr Andrew Duncan, who was active at this period in improving the treatment of the mentally ill in Edinburgh. Shocked by conditions in Edinburgh's city bedlam, after the death of his patient the poet Robert Fergusson in 1774, Duncan managed to ensure that it was replaced by a new Edinburgh lunatic asylum, which opened in 1813. From the 1810s onwards penetrating studies of madness begin to feature in Hogg's writings, and it seems likely that his friendship with Duncan helped to deepen his insights into such matters. <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Forest Minstrel</span>, <span class="italic">The Spy</span>, and the Forum were not enough to sustain Hogg financially in his early Edinburgh years; his situation would have been dire indeed had it not been for the financial assistance of John Grieve, an old Ettrick friend who was now a prosperous hatter in Edinburgh. Hogg's situation changed radically for the better, however, with the publication in January 1813 of <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span>. This book-length narrative poem tells of the return of Mary, queen of Scots, to Scotland after her long sojourn in France. To welcome the young queen a poetic competition&#151;described by Hogg as a &#145;wake&#146;&#151;is held at Holyrood Palace among the minstrels of Scotland. The poem tells the story of this event, interspersed with the songs sung by the minstrels. <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span> was immediately recognized as a major achievement, with spice added by the circumstances of Hogg's background and upbringing. Indeed, George Goldie, the publisher of the poem, assured readers in the second edition (1813) that the work was &#145;really and truly the production of <i>James Hogg</i>, a common shepherd, bred among the mountains of Ettrick Forest, who went to service when only seven years of age; and since that period has never received any education whatever&#146;  (p. vi). <br>
<br>Hogg's reputation as one of the leading poets of his generation was now established. As a rival of Scott and Byron among the fashionable poets of the 1810s he produced a formidable output in the years following the publication of <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span>. The third edition of that poem (1814) contains important revisions and was followed in 1815 by <span class="italic">Pilgrims of the Sun</span>, dedicated to Byron. Two new volumes followed in 1816: <span class="italic">Mador of the Moor</span>, which echoes and interrogates Scott's <span class="italic">Lady of the Lake</span>; and <span class="italic">The Poetic Mirror</span>, a volume of Hogg's brilliant and well-received poetic parodies (of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Scott, Hogg, and others). <span class="italic">Dramatic Tales</span>, a two-volume collection that reflects Hogg's long-standing interest in the theatre, followed in 1817. His status was confirmed with the publication by Archibald Constable in 1822 of his four-volume <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>. <br>
<br>Hogg's new-found fame was accompanied by other improvements in his fortunes. For example, in 1815 the duke of Buccleuch gave him the farm of Altrive Lake, in Yarrow, rent-free, for life. This provided Hogg with a much-valued base in his native Ettrick Forest, and for the remainder of his life he divided his time between Ettrick and Edinburgh. Likewise his new acceptance as an established literary figure helped him to play a significant part in the founding of <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> in 1817. The new magazine's fortunes were secured by the publication of the notorious &#145;Chaldee manuscript&#146; in the number for October 1817. This satirical article was drafted by Hogg and revised and expanded by John Wilson and John Gibson Lockhart. Hogg already had contacts with tory circles through his friendship with Scott, and from 1817 onwards the tory group of writers associated with <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> were to play an important part in his life. Hogg's dealings with the tory wits were never comfortable or easy (although he shared their interest in the traditions and customs of the old Scottish peasantry). Nevertheless <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> was liberal in its payment of authors, and Hogg's frequent contributions to its pages provided him with a useful source of income. <br>
<br>Hogg's poems of 1815&#150;17 did not emulate the great popular success of <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span>. As people got used to the idea that &#145;a common shepherd&#146; could &#145;really and truly&#146; be the author of first-rate poems the delightful sense of novelty began to wear off. Furthermore Hogg's middle-class audience began to feel increasingly uncomfortable about a subversive strand discernible in the writings of this uncouth farmworker. Hogg, like Burns before him, really believed that:<blockquote>
<div>The rank is but the guinea's stamp,<br>
</div>
<div>The Man's the gowd for a' that<br>
</div> (R. Burns, &#145;For a' that and a' that&#146;)</blockquote>and his middle-class audience came to have reservations about the way in which this uppity peasant demanded that his social superiors treat him as an equal. Hogg's raw talent was recognized, but increasingly his talent was felt to be deeply flawed by vanity, by lack of discretion, by &#145;indelicacy&#146;, and by a lack of knowledge of cultivated society and cultivated manners. In short for many middle-class readers of the late 1810s and the 1820s the fellow simply did not know his place, and showed himself to be incapable of properly recognizing and paying due deference to the many virtues of his social superiors. For example, the heroine of Hogg's <span class="italic">Mador of the Moor</span> is a peasant girl. This was bad enough, but she becomes pregnant out of wedlock, which was worse; worst of all she is not only presented as a character worthy of the reader's admiring sympathy but she eventually marries her seducer, who turns out to be no less a person than the king of Scots. Middle-class readers of the late 1810s could and did recognize that <span class="italic">Mador of the Moor</span> is a highly readable and skilfully written poem but many of them found it hard to accept a story that was willing to take seriously and reward a peasant girl who indulges in pre-marital sex. <br>
<br>At all events the comparative lack of success of the poems that followed <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span> seems to have generated, about 1817, something of a crisis in Hogg's self-confidence. In that year he abandoned an epic poem, <span class="italic">Queen Hynde</span>, of which he had already written more than two books, and for the next few years his creative energy was mainly directed towards the writing of prose fiction. <h2>
<a name="Hoggthenovelist18181824"></a>Hogg the novelist, 1818&#150;1824</h2>Hogg had already published prose fiction in <span class="italic">The Spy</span>, and from the early 1810s he had planned a collection of &#145;rural and traditionary tales&#146; of the kind told round the cottage fire during the long dark evenings of a Scottish winter. His first book of prose fiction, however, was <span class="italic">The Brownie of Bodsbeck and other Tales</span> (2 vols., 1818), which consists of three tales by Hogg, each dealing with Ettrick society at a different stage of its development. Thus &#145;The Hunt of Eildon&#146; is a tale of the supernatural set in the time when Ettrick was a royal hunting forest; &#145;The Brownie of Bodsbeck&#146; focuses on the experiences of the people of Ettrick during the terrible civil wars of the late seventeenth century; and &#145;The Wool-Gatherer&#146; is a love story set in the Ettrick of Hogg's own lifetime. <br>
<br>For his next major literary project Hogg set out to collect the songs of the Jacobite risings of the eighteenth century. In this he was encouraged by the Highland Society of London, and the project, which is akin to Scott's ballad-collecting for <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span> and Burns's efforts to collect and preserve traditional Scottish songs, bore fruit in the two volumes that make up Hogg's <span class="italic">Jacobite Relics</span> (1819; &#145;second series&#146;, 1821). In these volumes Hogg prints the music as well as the lyrics and provides extensive notes. <br>
<br>Hogg's comparative prosperity in the years after <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span> enabled him to marry Margaret Phillips (1790&#150;1870), daughter of a prosperous Dumfriesshire farmer, in April 1820. Margaret was the younger sister of the first wife of Hogg's friend James Gray, of the Edinburgh high school. Hogg got to know her at Gray's house in Edinburgh during the 1810s, when she was in her twenties. Though there was an age gap of some twenty years the marriage proved to be a very happy one, and the couple had four daughters and a son. <br>
<br>Other events of 1820 included the death of Hogg's father, at Altrive in October, at the age of ninety-one and the publication in Altrive of Hogg's well-received <span class="italic">Winter Evening Tales</span> (2 vols.). Encouraged by the fact that his financial position had been further improved by his marriage settlement, Hogg in 1821 took on a nine-year lease of Mount Benger, a farm adjacent to Altrive Lake. He was still far from affluent, however, and it was necessary for him to gather together as much capital as possible in order to stock the farm. This was the context in which he made arrangements for the publication of a new and revised edition of <span class="italic">The Mountain Bard</span> (1821) and for the publication of his four-volume <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1822). <br>
<br>In 1822 a tight financial situation was transformed into a potentially disastrous one when a relative of Margaret's mother absconded to America, leaving the Phillips family responsible for his debts. Instead of receiving the expected help from his parents-in-law with regard to the stocking of Mount Benger, Hogg had to provide them with support and a home for their few remaining years. The 1820s proved a period of agricultural recession, in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, and Hogg had to cope with the high rent of Mount Benger without having the capital to run the farm to best advantage. <br>
<br>Nevertheless the early 1820s were a particularly fruitful time for Hogg the writer. His three-volume novel <span class="italic">The Three Perils of Man</span> appeared in 1822. This &#145;Border romance&#146; set in the middle ages is in effect what Hollywood would call a &#145;prequel&#146; to Scott's narrative poem <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</span> (1805); in it Hogg both celebrates and questions the account of medieval chivalry in Scott's recent novel <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1820). <span class="italic">The Three Perils of Man</span> tells the story of a siege in the manner of a <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novel, but it is also a tale of the supernatural, typical of what late twentieth-century critics would call Hogg's magic realism. <br>
<br>Hogg's next novel, <span class="italic">The Three Perils of Woman</span> (1823), also employs a dual narrative; here a tale of lowland Scotland set in Hogg's own period mirrors and interacts with a tale of highland Scotland set around the time of the battle of Culloden, in 1746. Yet another dual narrative, <span class="italic">The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</span>, followed in June 1824. It offers competing attempts to tell the story of the life of Robert Wringhim; first a fictional &#145;Editor&#146; produces a narrative constructed after the manner of one of Scott's <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels, then the &#145;Editor&#146; prints Robert's own private memoirs and confessions. Later in 1824 Hogg completed <span class="italic">Queen Hynde</span>, which he had laid aside in 1817; this idiosyncratic alternative version of the Ossianic epics of James Macpherson was published in December 1824. These major works of the early 1820s have come to be much admired but they were not particularly well received at the time of their first publication. <h2>
<a name="Lateryears18241835"></a>Later years, 1824&#150;1835</h2>From the early 1820s onwards Hogg's considerable fame derived not only from his own writings but also from his portrayal as &#145;the Ettrick Shepherd&#146; in the &#145;Noctes Ambrosianae&#146; of <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. The &#145;Noctes&#146; articles were chiefly written by John Wilson and John Gibson Lockhart, and they purport to record the table talk of the <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> group of writers as they dine in Ambrose's Tavern. Much of the popularity of <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> derived from the &#145;Noctes&#146;&#151;and much of the attraction of the &#145;Noctes&#146; derived from the figure of the Ettrick Shepherd. From the &#145;Noctes&#146; the shepherd emerges as a vain, boastful, and bibulous oaf who nevertheless has the poetic inspiration of a genuine child of nature; the Noctean shepherd may be a boor but his unsophisticated simplicity can often enable him to get to the heart of the matter. Hogg's attitude to the &#145;Noctes&#146; fluctuated; sometimes he was infuriated and sometimes he enjoyed the joke. Partly as a result serious quarrels between Hogg and William Blackwood occurred from time to time. <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> was also an important outlet for Hogg's own shorter writings. <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Calendar</span> (2 vols., 1829) consists in the main of short stories that he had contributed to the magazine during the 1820s. Likewise <span class="italic">A Queer Book</span> (1832) consists of poems by Hogg, most of which had already appeared in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>. Other volumes from his later years include <span class="italic">Songs, by the Ettrick Shepherd</span> (1831), <span class="italic">Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott</span> (1834), and <span class="italic">A Series of Lay Sermons</span> (1834). The three-volume <span class="italic">Tales of the Wars of Montrose</span> (1835), a collection of interconnecting short stories and novellas, is one of Hogg's most daring and most innovative works. <br>
<br>By the 1820s periodicals had become much more generous in paying authors than when Hogg founded <span class="italic">The Spy</span> in 1810. In his later years Hogg often contributed to various periodicals (including, from 1830, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> in London), and this source of income helped him to struggle on with Mount Benger until the end of his lease, in 1830. At that point he became bankrupt. The rent-free farm of Altrive Lake remained to him, and on returning there with his family he was able to regain financial stability. However, he was by then sixty, and he was anxious to provide if possible for his young wife and younger family. Hogg therefore began to hatch plans for a collected edition of his writings along the lines of Sir Walter Scott's hugely successful <span class="italic">Magnum opus</span> collected edition, publication of which had commenced in 1829. <br>
<br>Plans for the collected edition took Hogg to London in the early months of 1832. He was rapturously received there, not only as the author of <span class="italic">The Queen's Wake</span> but also as the famous shepherd of the &#145;Noctes Ambrosianae&#146;. The collected edition promised well, and the first volume (<span class="italic">Altrive Tales</span>) appeared in 1832, after Hogg's return to Scotland. His hopes for it were destroyed, however, when its publisher, James Cochrane, became bankrupt shortly afterwards. <br>
<br>In the autumn of 1835 Hogg fell ill. Jaundice was diagnosed, and as the illness progressed it became clear that there was little hope of his recovery. Friends came to Altrive to try to help: Hogg was a much liked man. One lifelong Ettrick friend was Alexander Laidlaw, of Bowerhope farm, who in a letter describes how:<blockquote>I visited him on the 22nd October, and almost daily till the 19th November. After this I was in the room in which he died, never took off my clothes, but rested occasionally on a sofa&#151;never got home till the Saturday after the funeral. (Garden, 326)</blockquote>In its way Laidlaw's account is as moving as William Wordsworth's well-known &#145;Extempore Effusion on the Death of James Hogg&#146;. <br>
<br>Hogg died at his home, Altrive Lake farm, on 21 November 1835. He was buried in Ettrick churchyard, a stone's throw from his birthplace at Ettrick Hall. <h2>
<a name="Hoggsreputationandsignificance"></a>Hogg's reputation and significance</h2>James Hogg's status as a major writer was not fully recognized in his own lifetime because his social origins led to his being smothered in genteel condescension. The collected editions of his works published after his death did further damage; some major texts (for example, <span class="italic">The Three Perils of Woman</span>) are omitted entirely, while others (such as <span class="italic">The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</span>) are heavily bowdlerized. In short the nineteenth-century collected editions offer a bland and lifeless version of Hogg's writings. It was in this version that he was read by the Victorians, and unsurprisingly he came to be regarded as a minor figure, of no great importance or interest. However, the second half of the twentieth century saw a spectacular revival in Hogg's reputation as reliable texts of his writings increasingly became available. In 1995 Edinburgh University Press began to publish the multi-volume Stirling&#150;South Carolina research edition of the collected works. <br>
<br>Like Burns, Hogg questioned and subverted aspects of the Scottish Enlightenment, and created a space in which the allegedly &#145;marginal&#146; and &#145;primitive&#146; culture of the old Scottish peasantry could speak with eloquence and power. Like Burns, Macpherson, and Scott, Hogg made a distinctive Scottish contribution to European Romanticism.<br>
