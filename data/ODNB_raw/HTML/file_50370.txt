<span class="headword">Oliver,  Harry Mander</span>  (1855&#150;1918), <span class="occ">athletics administrator and journalist</span>, was born at 17 John Street West, Hemingford Road, Islington, on 28 February 1855, one of at least four sons of Henry Oliver (<i>d</i>. 1916) and his wife, Sarah Jane, formerly Mander. His father, a clerk at the Railway Clearing House, was the compiler from 1862 of a <span class="italic">Hand Book of the Stations and Sidings on the Railways in the United Kingdom</span>, but was also a keen athlete and one of the original members of the North London rowing club. Oliver was educated from 1867 at Framlingham College, Suffolk, where he made his mark as an athlete; at fourteen he finished fourth in a cross-country race that included boys four and five years older. At eighteen he was a founder member of Spartan Harriers, a club which operated from the Railway inn, Hornsey, and of which his father was president. He subsequently developed into a successful cross-country runner and steeplechaser in senior competition, finishing third in the English cross-country championship in 1878 and winning the steeplechase at the Amateur Athletic Club's meeting in 1879, an event that was effectively the championship of England.<br>
<br>When he moved to Birmingham in May 1876 to take a job with the Birmingham Banking Company, Oliver joined Moseley Harriers. For at least three years he was simultaneously a member of three clubs&#151;the Spartan and Moseley Harriers clubs and Birmingham athletic club&#151;but his chief interest was Moseley. He became the club secretary, retired from running and set out to make Moseley the top cross-country team in the country. This branch of the sport provided the first national inter-club championship in British athletics and Oliver's ambitions for his club were given added impetus when Birchfield Harriers, another Birmingham club, won the prestigious team championship in 1880, the first provincial club to do so. He responded by forming a strong Moseley team that won the title in four successive years from 1881 to 1884. The team included Walter George, William Snook, and other leading runners of the day from outside the Birmingham area. This was criticized as unsporting by Walter Rye, who commented on Oliver:<blockquote>Whether his administrative ability operated for the general benefit of the sport is &hellip; an open question among those who know anything about the subject, the general impression being that the eagerness with which men are caught up into clubs and imported into crack teams has spoiled the old feeling of <i>bona fide</i> competition. (M. Shearman, <span class="italic">Athletics and Football</span>, 1887, 376)</blockquote>The organization of athletics in the midlands was developing quickly at this time and Oliver was determined to be involved at all levels. Showing remarkable energy and ambition, he was the first secretary of both the Midland Counties Cross Country Association (from 1879) and the Midland Counties Amateur Athletic Association (from 1880), the moving force behind the formation (in 1883) of the English Cross Country Union, of which he also became secretary, and editor and part owner (1879&#150;1886) of the weekly magazine <span class="italic">Midland Athlete</span>. He was also official handicapper, timekeeper, and judge at the summer track meetings in the midlands. A man achieving so much power and influence was bound to have detractors and Oliver's chief adversary was W. W. Alexander of Birchfield Harriers. The two men were driven by an ambition to make their respective clubs the most successful in the midlands, and the Moseley&#150;Birchfield rivalry was a feature of the early years of club athletics. &#145;In constitution, composition and character they were diametrically opposite,&#146; Edward Lawrence Levy later commented: &#145;Moseley Harriers were a &#147;Sassiety&#148; [<i>sic</i>] club, the Birchfield Harriers were typical of the &#147;fierce democracy&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of an Athlete</span>, 1913, 119&#150;20.) The likely inference was that Moseley members were &#145;white collar&#146; and Birchfield's &#145;blue collar&#146;.<br>
<br>Moseley's standing as the top cross-country club ended in 1885 when George turned professional and Snook joined Birchfield. Oliver's position as the most influential man in midland athletics came to an end on 7 January 1887, when he went to prison for three months for embezzling money from the bank at which he worked in order to pay debts incurred in financing the <span class="italic">Midland Athlete</span>. The magazine was discontinued, Moseley Harriers disbanded, and he played no further part in athletics. By 1891 he was running the Crown Hotel, Evesham, with his wife, Florence Maria Bromage (1856&#150;1937), whom he married in 1881; she was the daughter of Joseph Bromage, jeweller. They had at least one son. They later managed the Royal Hotel, Sutton Coldfield. He died at the New Inn, Market Place, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, of which he was proprietor, on 9 March 1918.<br>
