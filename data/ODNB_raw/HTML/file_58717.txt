<span class="headword">Veale,  Richard</span>  (1687?&#150;1756), <span class="occ">master mariner and privateer</span>, was probably the son of Richard Veale, a fuller, who was born on 20 January 1687 and baptized in St George's, Exeter, on 30 January. Another son, Joseph, became receiver of taxes for Devon. Veale married twice. His first wife, Margaret Brown, died in July 1734; they had two children, but both had died in infancy. On 6 May 1735 he married Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1716, <i>d</i>. 1754), daughter of James King, a City merchant.<br>
<br>After extensive experience as a master Veale was commissioned in 1744, when the war against Spain was formally extended to France, as commander of the <i>Hunter</i>, a private man-of-war. He subsequently commanded the privateers <i>Inspector</i> and <i>Dreadnought</i>.<br>
<br>Veale's successes as a privateer included the capture of an English privateer from a French man-of-war which had taken her; and after a running sea fight, the capture of a valuable French privateer. But they were offset when several owners of the <i>Hunter</i> brought proceedings against him in the court of chancery in June 1746, and by the earlier wreck of the <i>Inspector</i> in Tangier Bay in January 1746, with the loss of ninety-six men and the imprisonment of most of the rest of the crew. Veale was rescued by HMS <i>Phoenix</i>. The last survivors were not freed until 1750, and an account of their suffering was published by a member of the crew in the following year.<br>
<br>By 1749 Veale had resumed his career as a merchant mariner&#151;in command of the <i>Queen of Portugal</i>, on which he carried Henry Fielding to Lisbon in 1754. Fielding has left a vivid picture of Veale. He presents him as a mercurial figure: a brave and good-natured man who was a father to his sailors, but who &#145;wore a sword of no ordinary length by his side, with which he swaggered in his cabin, among the wretches his passengers, whom he had stowed in cupboards on each side&#146; and had &#145;a voice capable of deafening all others&#146;  (Fielding, 29). Veale died two years after his second wife, in June 1756. His will was proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 19 October 1756.<br>
