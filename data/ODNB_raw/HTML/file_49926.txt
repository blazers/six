<span class="headword">Pickering,  Ronald James <span class="st"> [Ron]</span></span>  (1930&#150;1991), <span class="occ">athletics coach and sports commentator</span>, was born on 4 May 1930 at 230 High Street in the London borough of Hackney, the son of James Thomas Pickering, a sign fixer, and his wife, Ivy Christina Wing. He was educated at Stratford grammar school, where he was head boy alongside the head girl Jean Catherine Desforges (1929&#150;2013), who became European long-jump champion and Pickering's wife. After national service in the King's Own regiment he took a diploma in physical education at Carnegie College, Leeds, and then a master's degree in education at Leicester University before teaching, first at his old school and then at Wanstead grammar school. While still a games master he married his childhood sweetheart on 23 October 1954 at Emmanuel Church, Forest Gate, West Ham.<br>
<br>In 1961 Pickering was appointed national coach for Wales and the south-west. On a visit to the Glamorgan schools championships he spotted the long-jump potential of Lynn Davies, whom he guided to Olympic, Commonwealth, and European gold medals. He was one of the first coaches to appreciate the value of weight training for all athletes, not just for the throwers. As a coach he could be tough and uncompromising, but he believed that these were the very qualities required of athletes at the highest levels. He was one of the British team coaches at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 and the coach of the Welsh team at the Commonwealth games in Jamaica two years later.<br>
<br>Pickering then became recreational manager at the Lee Valley Regional Park in London but two years later set up as a consultant in recreational planning management, work he continued as he moved into television commentating. His broadcasting career began at the 1968 Olympics, and he remained a fixture in the commentary box for two decades. Although he was best recognized for explaining the complexities of track and field to the viewing public, he brought his informed enthusiasm and strong, authoritative tones to skiing, gymnastics, and weightlifting as well as participating in popular television broadcasts such as <span class="italic">Superstars</span> and <span class="italic">We are the Champions</span>.<br>
<br>Convinced that sport had much to offer young people in their formative teenage years, Pickering fought hard to protect sport from adverse influences. He continually spoke out against drugs, racism, and the evils of market forces in sport. As a broadcaster he recognized the influence of the media and was always willing to provide the sound bite or headline-grabbing quotation. He extolled everything that was good about sport because, as he said, &#145;what else can we hand to the next generation that can match its value, always provided that we teach them what those values are&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 17 Feb 1991). In the early 1980s he conceived the idea of turning a disused banana warehouse on the Isle of Dogs into an indoor training centre for the youngsters of east London. However, to his profound disappointment, the building became viable only in the form of the London Arena, primarily a venue for large sporting and theatrical events.<br>
<br>Pickering detested racism and did much to bring young black people into athletics. He was proud that the Haringey club of which he was president had some 70 per cent of its athletes from ethnic minorities. He championed the cause of black African athletes, using two highly commended documentaries on South Africa and Kenya to good effect, and was at the forefront of the anti-apartheid boycott of South African sport. The black runner Linford Christie gave worthy recognition to Pickering's achievements when he dedicated his 100 metre gold-medal performance to his memory.<br>
<br>Pickering listed his hobbies as &#145;lost causes and tilting at windmills&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 Feb 1991). Clearly he lost the battle against professionalism and drug taking in athletics, but he remained the public conscience of the sport, a staunch defender of traditional principles and philosophies. He was appointed OBE for services to sport in 1986. He died of heart failure on 13 February 1991 at his home, Woodcote, 1B Harmer Dell, Digswell, Welwyn, Hertfordshire, six weeks after undergoing a seventeen-hour heart bypass operation. His friends and colleagues established the Ron Pickering memorial fund to support promising athletes by the provision of equipment and bursaries. His widow, son, and daughter were joined by a galaxy of sporting and journalistic figures at his memorial service, held at All Souls, Langham Place, London, on 24 May 1991.<br>
