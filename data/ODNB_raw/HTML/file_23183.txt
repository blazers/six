<span class="headword">Rawlet,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1642, <em>d.</em> 1686), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at St Editha's Church, Tamworth, on the Warwickshire&#150;Staffordshire border, on 27 March 1642, the son of William Rawlet (<i>d</i>. 1643) and his wife, Margery. His father was killed fighting in the civil war (probably as a parliamentarian soldier) in late 1643. From his mother Rawlet received a &#145;pious education&#146;  (Rawlet, 3). He probably attended Tamworth grammar school, where the presbyterian Samuel Shaw became master in 1656; when Shaw became curate of Moseley chapel in the parish of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in 1657 Rawlet followed him, perhaps continuing as his pupil. He was admitted sizar to Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 30 November 1658, matriculating on 1 December 1659. However, owing to poverty he did not graduate, though he was later created BD, on 23 June 1676 by royal mandate. The apparent coincidence of his withdrawal from Cambridge with the establishment of the Restoration settlement, his connections with presbyterian ministers before and after 1660, and the long period before he received Anglican ordination suggest that conscientious scruples as well as financial reasons may have terminated his Cambridge education.<br>
<br>After Cambridge Rawlet spent some time &#145;at my Cozen Woods alone&#146;  (Manuell, &#145;John Rawlett, BD&#146;, 3), probably his cousin John Wood, curate of the chapel of St Leonard's in the parish of Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. After some years he moved to London to serve as tutor and (although he had not apparently yet taken holy orders) chaplain in the household of John Pynsent, protonotary of the court of common pleas, in Bartlett's court in St Andrew's, Holborn. He was there at the time of the great plague of 1665; in the &#145;consolatory letter&#146; which he wrote to his mother at this time he expressed his fear of dying from the pestilence. In 1667 Rawlet published <span class="italic">A Treatise of Sacramental Covenanting with Christ</span> (in the first edition anonymously under the initials M. M.); it had reached eight editions by 1736. Richard Baxter, who may have known Rawlet from his Moseley days, provided the preface, dated 6 September 1666, describing the book as &#145;high and excellent&#146; in its aim &#145;to convince poor, impenitent, unholy souls, of the absolute necessity of a speedy, resolute, faithful consent to the Covenant of Grace&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.53).<br>
<br>Through the Pynsent connection Rawlet evidently preached at Hulcott in Bedfordshire, where Pynsent's daughter Anne lived. In late 1669 or late 1670 Rawlet became curate of Dunton in Buckinghamshire. In the spring of 1670 he was ordained and became curate of Wigan, Lancashire, a rectory held <i>in commendam</i> by the bishop of Chester, John Wilkins; he also acted for a short time as Wilkins's chaplain. Rawlet noted in a letter to Baxter concerning his move to Wigan, &#145;I table in a good honest family, with one Mr Herle, son to him [Charles Herle] who was sometime prolocutor of the [Westminster] Assembly&#146;. He went on to describe how he was &pound;20 poorer for his move, but was rewarded by having twenty times more people to preach to than at Hulcott and Dunton  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.89&#150;90). John Tillotson suggested that Rawlet apply for the position of lecturer in Baxter's old parish of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and Rawlet went as far as delivering a trial sermon in September 1671. But he concluded that his services were better employed in Wigan, where &#145;beside the too large parish with which I am in some sort charged, there are few holy daies but I am engagd to preach somewhere about us&#146;, for which he had Wilkins's &#145;free leave&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.119). On 18 September the nonconformist minister Oliver Heywood heard one such sermon when Rawlet preached outside his parish at Bolton. In 1672 Rawlet published <span class="italic">An explication of the creed, the ten commandments and the Lord's Prayer</span>, like his first work a devotional work designed for the use of the poor.<br>
<br>From 1673 to 1682 Rawlet was minister of Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland. On 25 June 1679 he succeeded John Marsh in the lectureship of St Nicholas, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then was spoken of as &#145;a very pious and charitable man&#146;  (Longstaffe, 418). From early 1682 he was appointed to the newly restored chapel of St Ann's in the slum area of Sandgate, with responsibility for catechizing the children in the school that the council had established there. Evidently a popular minister, in March 1682 he declined the offer of Simon Digby, Lord Digby, of the vicarage of Coleshill in Warwickshire because the people of Newcastle &#145;so earnestly beset him with their intreaties, not to leave them&#146;, and instead he recommended Thomas Kettlewell to the vacancy  (Bray, preface). Rawlet remained in Newcastle for the rest of his life. He was described as &#145;the happy instrument of gaining more souls to God, by his plain, pathetic and practical preaching, and by an uncommon exemplariness in life and conversation, than most others in the days he lived in&#146;  (Bray, sig. C). He continued his work of proselytizing the poor in print. In 1685 he published <span class="italic">A Dialogue betwixt Two Protestants, in Answer to a Popish Catechism</span>, and the following year <span class="italic">The Christian Monitor</span>, which went through many editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (seven alone in its first year) and was translated into French and Welsh. The twentieth edition, published in 1696, claimed that 95,000 copies had by then been sold. Rawlet hoped that it would be &#145;scattered abroad upon pedlars stalls and thence come into the hands of the common people&#146;  (Green, 357), and while it was normally sold at 3<i>d</i>., it was also offered in job lots of 100 copies for &pound;1 to the charitably disposed to give away.<br>
<br>When close to death, on 25 September 1686 Rawlet went through the ceremony of marriage with Anne (1650/51&#150;1703), the daughter of Thomas Butler, a merchant of Newcastle who had been sheriff there in 1652. The marriage took place at her request, and they had apparently &#145;been some time in love together&#146;  (Longstaffe, 54). He died in Newcastle three days later, on 28 September 1686, and was buried on 30 September at St Nicholas's. In his will he left landed property in Tamworth, yielding an annual income of just over &pound;23, and his library of over 900 books to his native town, in the hope of benefiting its school and inhabitants.<br>
