<span class="headword">Tombes,  John</span>  (1602&#150;1676), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Bewdley, Worcestershire, and was baptized in the parish of Ribbesford (which included Bewdley) on 10 October 1602, the son of Edward Tombes, a dyer. His mother's identity is unknown, but he had at least one elder sister. He probably attended Bewdley grammar school. On 23 January 1618 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he was a batteler, and was admitted BA on 12 June 1621, MA on 16 April 1624, and BD in Trinity term 1631. An accomplished linguist, he was the favourite pupil of the Hebraist William Pemble, and reputedly had the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> &#145;almost memoriter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.258). In 1623 he succeeded Pemble as catechism lecturer at Magdalen Hall, and while preparing a lecture in 1627 began to doubt the scriptural basis for infant baptism. During this period he was ordained and appointed a lecturer at St Martin Carfax, where his preaching was much admired, particularly by puritans. He &#145;was soon taken notice of&#146; both for his intellectual ability and for his potential to &#145;doe a great deale of mischiefe to the Church of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.258).<br>
<br>In 1630 Tombes became a preacher at Worcester, and on 17 November 1630 was instituted vicar of Leominster, Herefordshire. At about this time he married Elizabeth Scudder (1613&#150;1633), daughter of the puritan divine Henry Scudder. Elizabeth died on 15 December 1633, leaving an only daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1658). Tombes had remarried by 1636, when his only son, John, was born on 26 November.<br>
<br>Tombes was highly regarded in Leominster until he became actively involved with the county's parliamentarian and presbyterian minority. His &#145;disusing the ceremonies&#146; in December 1640 &#145;nettled the ignorant and superstitious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 3.76), as did his participation in a puritan survey of Herefordshire clergy in early 1641. Early in 1642 he organized resubscription to the protestation oath and promoted a pro-parliamentary petition. By early August, the &#145;barbarous rage and impetuous violence of people&#146; forced Tombes, his wife, and children to flee Herefordshire  (J. Tombes, <span class="italic">Fermentum Pharisaeorum</span>, 1643, sig. A2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>&#145;After much wandring up and down&#146;  (Tombes, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 6), Tombes was appointed lecturer at All Saints, Bristol, on 4 January 1643. During the next few months he published the sermons <span class="italic">Iehovah iireh</span> and <span class="italic">Fermentum Pharisaeorum</span> in support of his party's cause. He also had a momentous dispute with an antipaedobaptist which further undermined his belief in infant baptism, and left him resolved to go to London in order to &#145;consider that matter more full&#146;  (ibid., 6). However, in mid-July 1643 royalist advances forced him and his family to escape from Bristol by sea to Milford Haven.<br>
<br>Tombes eventually arrived in London on 22 September 1643, and by January 1644 was convinced of the case against infant baptism. By July he had presented a Latin &#145;Exercitation&#146; on the scriptural evidence to the Westminster assembly, hoping in vain to have his arguments considered &#145;in a faire Scholastike way&#146;  (Tombes, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 15). He also drew up a detailed manuscript &#145;Examen&#146; of a sermon by Stephen Marshall published in August 1644 in defence of infant baptism, which was delivered to Marshall on 9 December and followed by a &#145;friendly conference&#146; between the two men on 30 December 1644  (ibid., 11). During 1644 Tombes had been rector of St Gabriel Fenchurch but, his parishioners having become &#145;disaffected&#146;  (ibid., 10), he lost his position. On the understanding that he would not preach his antipaedobaptist opinions, he was appointed at the end of January 1645, apparently through Marshall's influence, to be master of the Temple where, as preacher to its two inns of court, he would not need to baptize infants. In May 1645 Tombes agreed to a copy of his &#145;Examen&#146; being sent to New England by the Baptist Henry Jessey. He still, however, received no response from the assembly to his arguments, and on 15 December 1645 he published as <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> an English translation of his &#145;Exercitation&#146;, and the &#145;Examen&#146;. Numerous attacks on Tombes swiftly appeared in print, including one by Marshall dedicated to the assembly; in August 1646 Tombes defended himself in <span class="italic">An Apology or Plea for the Two Treatises</span>, but, in spite of presenting his writings to Cromwell, he was removed from the Temple.<br>
<br>Tombes returned during 1646 to his native Bewdley as curate of the town's chapel of ease. On 12 September 1646 he was also appointed rector of Ross, Herefordshire. He now devoted himself to the work which &#145;the Lord hath alotted me&#146;, the recovery of believers' baptism  (J. Tombes, <span class="italic">Antipaedobaptism</span>, 3 vols., 1652&#150;7, vol. 1, sig. A2<i>r</i>). At Bewdley, while retaining his parish role, he founded a small Baptist congregation, training some of its members for the Baptist ministry. On 1 January 1650 his celebrated public debate on baptism with Richard Baxter took place in Bewdley chapel, lasting from nine in the morning until five at night. Tombes was acknowledged to be the better disputant, but the numerous followers of each side at last &#145;fell by the eares, hurt was donne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.259). Tombes and Baxter were to maintain an uneasy relationship for the next twenty years, &#145;not enemies though antagonists&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.416).<br>
<br>Perhaps as a result of this debate, Tombes left Bewdley during 1650, and by October 1651 had returned to his vicarage at Leominster, where he was to remain until 1662. He was also appointed master of St Catherine's Hospital, Ledbury, on 12 April 1649, a commissioner for approbation of public preachers in 1654, and an assistant to the Herefordshire commission on 29 September 1657. During this period Tombes participated in several other public debates on baptism, including a formal disputation with Henry Savage at the annual Oxford Act in 1652; he also disputed against Quakers, encountering George Fox in 1657. He published accounts of some of these debates, but his major work of the 1650s was the three-part <span class="italic">Antipaedobaptism</span> (1652, 1654, 1657), an exhaustive analysis of the arguments of his numerous opponents. He continued to foster Baptist congregations, but was gradually returning to his earlier belief that separation was not justifiable. It was to promote protestant unity that in 1659 he invited Baxter to contribute prefaces to <span class="italic">Romanism Discussed</span> (1660) and the anti-Quaker <span class="italic">True Old Light Exalted</span> (1660).<br>
<br>In 1660 Tombes &#145;willingly submitted&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1063) to the Restoration, and published <span class="italic">A Serious Consideration</span> in defence of taking the oath of supremacy. For this and other works on the same subject he received a yearly pension of &pound;50 through the influence of Clarendon, whom he had known at Magdalen Hall. None the less, his opposition to infant baptism made his ejection under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> inevitable; in September 1662 Herbert Croft, bishop of Hereford, reported that &#145;the proud Anabaptist Toms, than whom I never knew a prouder&#146; had refused subscription  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 48, fol. 41).<br>
<br>On 4 September 1661 Tombes had married his third wife, the widow Elizabeth Combs, by licence at St Edmund's, Salisbury, and after his ejection he settled in her parish. With his characteristic blend of conservatism and radicalism, he regularly attended the parish church and received communion, while adhering to his tenet on infant baptism &#145;by going out of the Church whilst that office was performing and returning in again when it was ended&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 488). He was on good terms both with Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, and with local nonconformists. After the declaration of indulgence in 1672 his house was licensed as a presbyterian meeting-place, and he sometimes preached, &#145;though seldome &amp; to few&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.138).<br>
<br>Although Tombes continued &#145;every where disputing for his old opinion concerning paedobaptisme&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.138), he accommodated his publications to the new regime, attacking Fifth Monarchists in <span class="italic">Saints No Smiters</span> (1664), separatists in <span class="italic">Theodulia</span> (1667), both dedicated to Clarendon, and Socinians in <span class="italic">Emmanuel, or, God-Man</span> (1669). His last work was <span class="italic">Animadversiones in librum Georgii Bulli</span> (1676), a Calvinist contribution to the controversy over Bull's <span class="italic">Harmonia apostolica</span> (1670).<br>
<br>Tombes was &#145;but a little man, neat limbed, a little quick searching eie, sad, gray&#146;. Although a formidable disputant, he was charitable to his opponents and was generally acknowledged to be &#145;as great a divine as most we had&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.260, 259). But as Tombes himself recognized, those &#145;usefull to uphold a Party, are the men esteemed&#146;  (Tombes, 3). He was alienated from presbyterians by his antipaedobaptism, and from most Baptists, even while being widely perceived as &#145;the great Ringleader of that Sect&#146;, by his acceptance of an established church  (BL, Add. MS 63054, fol. 194<i>r</i>. 2). His reputation both in his own time and subsequently has suffered as a result.<br>
<br>John Tombes made his will on 6 May 1676 and died on 22 May at Salisbury, survived by his wife, Elizabeth. He was buried on 25 May in St Edmund's churchyard. He left an extensive library of controversial writings and &#145;Godly english Treatises&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/351, fol. 331<i>v</i>); his epitaph, composed by himself, describes him simply as &#145;a constant preacher of God's word&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.260).<br>
