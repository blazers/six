<span class="headword">Mildert,  William  Van</span>  (1765&#150;1836), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was born on 6 November 1765 at his father's residence in Blackman Street, Southwark, London, the fourth child and second son of Cornelius Van Mildert (1722&#150;1799), gin distiller, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (1732&#150;1804). He was baptized on 8 December by the rector of Newington, Samuel Horsley. Cornelius Van Mildert was the great-grandson of an Amsterdam merchant who migrated to London around 1670. His father Abraham and grandfather Daniel were deacons of the Dutch Reformed church at Austin Friars; Cornelius himself was a devout Anglican and fringe associate of the writer and pamphleteer William Stevens (1732&#150;1807). He achieved little commercial success. Martha was the only daughter of William Hill of Vauxhall, Surrey, merchant and financier; her brother's influence with the Grocers' Company won William Van Mildert his first important preferment.<br>
<br>Van Mildert was interested in his Dutch antecedents, touring the Low Countries in July&#150;August 1792, but regarded himself emphatically as an Englishman. He attended St Saviour's School, Southwark, until, aged about thirteen, he persuaded his father to let him seek holy orders. Although Horsley advised against &#145;diverting the boy from trade&#146;  (Ives, 6), about 1779 Van Mildert entered Merchant Taylors' School to prepare for university. He was a commoner at the Queen's College, Oxford, from 1784, graduating BA in November 1787 and proceeding MA in July 1790. On 18 May 1788 he was ordained deacon to the Oxford curacy of Monk Sherborne, Hampshire, and Lewknor, Oxfordshire, moving in 1789 to become curate of Newchurch and Bonnington, on Romney Marsh in Kent.<br>
<br>Ordained priest on 10 December 1789, in 1790 he became curate of Witham, Essex. There he courted Jane (1760&#150;1837), third daughter of General Douglas, a former aide-de-camp to George II. Her brother Philip, master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, from 1795, doubted Van Mildert's financial soundness, but in 1795 Van Mildert was instituted to the small living of Bradden, Northamptonshire, by Cornelius Ives, his cousin and brother-in-law, and he married Jane on 22 December. They never had children; Jane's nieces Mary and Helen Margaret became their foster-daughters and her nephew Henry was among Van Mildert's principal prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.<br>
<br>In July 1796, sponsored by his uncle William Hill, Van Mildert became chaplain to the Grocers' Company and rector of St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside, London. There was no habitable parsonage, so he rented 14 Ely Place, Holborn, just outside the parish boundary. In 1800 he was prosecuted for technical non-residence and, although Archbishop Moore of Canterbury spoke on his behalf and the court accepted that he was performing all his duties, Van Mildert was found guilty. His case was cited in parliament and the press as demonstrating the injustice of the legal situation and the urgent need for reform.<br>
<br>In London, Van Mildert became an active member of the high-church campaigning group known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/52465', "Hackney Phalanx")</script>. He was elected to William Stevens's exclusive Nobody's Club in 1802, co-edited a two-volume anthology of reprinted tracts, <span class="italic">The Churchman's Remembrancer</span> (1802&#150;8), and was briefly editor of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, bought about 1811 to promote the group's viewpoint. He served as treasurer of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge from 1812 to 1815 and helped to found the National Society (1811) and the Church Building Society (1818).<br>
<br>Van Mildert's Boyle lectures of 1802&#150;5 (published in 1806), which depicted Judaism, Islam, popery, freemasonry, and the French Revolution as elements in a conspiracy masterminded by Satan, established him among the foremost conservative theologians of his day. Their footnotes are particularly extensive. Van Mildert's knowledge of divinity was such that when his friends read snippets from obscure theological works and challenged him to name the author he was seldom caught out. From 1812 to 1819 he was preacher of Lincoln's Inn, and his 1812 sermon on the assassination of Spencer Perceval achieved wide circulation. He was Bampton lecturer in 1814, and in 1823 published a ten-volume edition of the works of Daniel Waterland.<br>
<br>In March 1807 Van Mildert became chaplain to his wife's kinsman the fourth duke of Queensberry, an appointment which entitled him to hold two benefices in plurality. In April Archbishop Manners-Sutton made him vicar of Farningham, Kent. The parsonage was uninhabitable, and the building work ran dramatically over budget. In 1810 Van Mildert escaped bankruptcy only because his Hackney Phalanx associates paid his debts. He gave up Ely Place and lived economically at Farningham: in 1813 a messenger from Lord Liverpool could find no servant but &#145;a female presiding at the churn&#146; who made him keep the churn moving while she fetched her master  (Churton, 1.138). Liverpool's offer of the regius professorship of divinity at Oxford and the rectory of Ewelme in Oxfordshire was gratefully accepted. As regius professor Van Mildert also became BD, DD, and a canon of Christ Church.<br>
<br>Consecrated bishop of Llandaff on 31 May 1819, Van Mildert unlike his predecessors resided in the diocese each summer from 1821, renting Coldbrook House near Abergavenny since the bishop's palace was in ruins. He proved a conscientious diocesan and able administrator, serving on a Queen Anne's Bounty committee to assist benefices under &pound;50 yearly value and on the Church Building Commission. In 1820 he declined the archbishopric of Dublin, instead becoming dean of St Paul's <i>in commendam</i> with Llandaff. In November 1820 he was notified of Queen Caroline's intention to attend worship at St Paul's in thanksgiving for her deliverance from the bill of pains and penalties. Van Mildert, whose support for the bill had caused disturbances at Ewelme, outraged <span class="italic">The Times</span> by the curtness of his acknowledgement. His absence from the service was noted. On 25 March 1826 Van Mildert accepted Liverpool's offer of the palatine bishopric of Durham. He poured Durham's vast revenues into church building, parsonage building, augmenting small stipends, and establishing parish schools. In 1827 he hosted a resplendent banquet for the duke of Wellington, then making a triumphal tour of the north-east, but deliberately blunted the political edge of the festivities by also honouring Sir Walter Scott.<br>
<br>As a parliamentarian he was eloquent, respected, and consistently unsuccessful. Although his close friend Charles Lloyd cajoled him into supporting the 1828 repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, Van Mildert resisted Catholic emancipation to the end. His bitter public clash with Lloyd during the 1829 Lords debate contributed to Lloyd's early death. Burned in effigy at his castle gates in November 1831 for opposing parliamentary reform, Van Mildert was prominent in co-ordinating episcopal resistance to the <span class="roman">&#145;Irish Church Spoliation Bill&#146;</span> (the <span class="roman">Irish Church Temporalities Bill</span>) of 1833. His refusal to compromise even with tory political necessity guaranteed his omission from Peel's 1835 ecclesiastical commission and may explain why in 1828 Wellington, though regarding Van Mildert as the prime candidate for the archbishopric of Canterbury, recommended the king to choose William Howley instead.<br>
<br>In June 1831 Archdeacon Thorp of Durham suggested to Van Mildert that founding a university at Durham would &#145;give to the Dean &amp; Chapter strength of character &amp; usefulness&#146;, help preserve ecclesiastical revenues from the threat of reform, and pre-empt moves to establish a London-style secular university at Newcastle upon Tyne,  (Thorp to Van Mildert, 11 June 1831, Oxford, Balliol College, MS Jenkyns IV A). Van Mildert championed the proposal with the dean and chapter, the Grey government, and ultimately in parliament. Besides his advocacy and munificent financial contributions&#151;the dean and chapter collectively provided &pound;3000 per annum, the bishop &pound;2000 with many additional specific benefactions&#151;Van Mildert secured most of his fellow bishops' agreement to accept Durham degrees as qualification for holy orders. He also recruited H. J. Rose as Durham's first professor of divinity. The <span class="roman">Durham University Bill</span> became law in July 1832 and the university admitted its first students in October 1833.<br>
<br>Van Mildert was of medium height and slight build, with an expressive face, &#145;well able, when it behoved him, to assume a highly imposing step and mien&#146;  (Ives, 153). His health was never robust and he was known for the austerity of his diet. Following a surgical operation in 1824 his last years were narrowed by constant pain. His wife, after a stroke in 1833 which affected her personality, lived at Harrogate until her death in 1837. Van Mildert died at Auckland Castle, co. Durham, on 21 February 1836, collapsing after a minor illness into a week of steadily deepening stupor followed by a peaceful death. Although he wished to be buried in the Auckland chapel with sumptuous ceremonial, he was entombed in a vault in front of Durham Cathedral's high altar. Shortly after Van Mildert's death the bishopric was stripped of its palatine status and the remnant of its ancient secular powers.<br>
