<span class="headword">Taylor,  Edgar</span>  (1793&#150;1839), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, the fifth son of Samuel Taylor, and great-grandson of the dissenting divine and Hebrew scholar John Taylor (1694&#150;1761), was born at Banham, Norfolk, on 28 January 1793. He was at school at Palgrave, Suffolk, under the Presbyterian schoolmaster Charles Lloyd (1766&#150;1829) who trained him as classical scholar. In 1809 he was articled to his uncle, Meadows Taylor, solicitor, of Diss, Norfolk. He had mastered Italian and Spanish before going to London in 1814; subsequently he learned German and French. In 1817, in conjunction with Robert Roscoe, a son of William Roscoe, the historian, he inaugurated the firm of Taylor and Roscoe, solicitors, in King's Bench Walk, Temple. He was an original member of the &#145;Noncon Club&#146;, founded in July 1817. His legal career, chiefly in equity practice, was prosperous. He married, in 1823, Ann, daughter of John Christie of Hackney. Between 1824 and 1826 his anonymous translations from the <span class="italic">Kinder und Haus-M&auml;rchen</span> of J. L. and C. G. Grimm were published under the title <span class="italic">German Popular Stories</span>, with illustrations by George Cruikshank. A second edition, entitled <span class="italic">Gammer Grethel</span>, appeared in 1839. In 1827 Taylor became incurably ill and from 1832 he was compelled to relinquish much of his professional work. He found literature a solace amid pain.<br>
<br>Taylor's interest in the legal recognition of the rights of nonconformists was keen and untiring. As a dissenting deputy he took an active part in the movement for repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>; in 1837 he was appointed a commissioner (unpaid) for carrying out the <span class="roman">Dissenters' Marriage Act</span>. In ecclesiastical politics he co-operated with Robert Aspland. His personal charm and strength of character were described as very great. After long suffering, he died at Bedford Row on 19 August 1839, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was survived by his wife and an only daughter.<br>
<br>Among his publications were works concerning constitutional law, the Norman conquest, a revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (edited by William Hincks), and <span class="italic">The Suffolk Bartholomeans: a Memoir of John Meadows</span> published in 1840, edited by <a href="#cosubject_27026">Emily Taylor [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He wrote in <span class="italic">The Jurist</span>, <span class="italic">Legal Observer</span>, <span class="italic">Retrospective Review</span>, <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Among his contributions to the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> were a memoir of John James Wetstein, the biblical critic; and &#145;Observations on Mahometanism&#146;.<br>
<br>His sister, <a name="cosubject_27026"></a><span class="headword">Emily Taylor</span>  (1795&#150;1872), <span class="occ">schoolmistress and author</span>, was also born in Banham, Norfolk. Partially deaf as a result of contracting scarlet fever at the age of seven, she had no formal education but was allowed free access to her father's library. When she moved with her father to nearby New Buckenham she established a school there for about thirty boys and girls. Partly thanks to her friendship with Sarah Glover, improver of the tonic sol-fa system of musical notation, the school successfully emphasized the teaching of singing. Many girls from Buckenham School became music teachers in schools and choirs. In 1842 Emily Taylor moved to London to live with a widowed sister. After some years spent superintending Lady Noel Byron's Schools in Ealing and elsewhere, she established a small middle-class school for girls in her neighbourhood of London. Her publications reflect her career as a schoolteacher. She wrote <span class="italic">England and its People</span> (1860), a school history, numerous historical tales, and a popular biography of Sir Thomas More. She was also the writer of many hymns. Originally a Unitarian, she joined the Church of England, before middle age, under the influence of Frederick Denison Maurice, though it was said that she was not interested in matters of religious doctrine. She died in London on 11 March 1872.<br>
