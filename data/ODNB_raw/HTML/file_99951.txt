<span class="headword">Hunter,  George Kirkpatrick</span>  (1920&#150;2008), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at 77 Cuthbertson Street, Govanhill, a tenement district of Glasgow, on 7 October 1920, the only child of Samuel George Hunter, a journeyman electrician, and his wife, Mary Scott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Currie. He developed both his love of books and his prodigious memory early. At elementary school in Cupar, Fife, given the run of the minister's library, he devoured the works of Sir Walter Scott from <span class="italic">Waverley</span> to <span class="italic">Woodstock</span>. On holidays in Moniaive, when his grandfather, the village schoolmaster, rashly challenged him to a wager designed to keep the over-talkative lad quiet, he flummoxed the old man and pocketed a schoolboy-sized fortune by learning psalms off by heart at sixpence each. Winning a bursary to Allen Glen's School, a science- and engineering-focused selective secondary school where his education was grounded (also) in the classics, he proceeded to Glasgow University in 1936 to read English literature. The importance of philosophy in the syllabus there gave him a breadth of reading unknown to most English humanities undergraduates, and shaped his understanding of what should constitute a university education.<br>
<br>Pre-empting call-up, and instead of starting his final year at university (though still having earned a university degree), Hunter joined the Royal Navy in 1939 and, assigned to convoy duties aboard HMS <i>Ulster Queen</i> in the Baltic, taught himself basic Russian so that he could serve as an interpreter. Later he trained as a code breaker in Japanese at Bletchley Park and was posted to Ceylon in 1944. He was reassigned, after Japan's surrender in August 1945, to Hong Kong as interpreter for a war crimes tribunal.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1946 Hunter enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a DPhil in 1950 for a thesis whose title&#151;&#145;A comparison of the use of the sententia, considered as a typical rhetorical ornament, in the tragedies of Seneca, and in those of Gascoigne, Kyd, Heywood, Jonson, Marston, Dekker, Webster and Greville&#146;&#151;could serve as an epitome of his work in Renaissance studies, signalling its attention to the classical tradition's survival in early modernity, to language, rhetoric, cultural inheritance, comparativism, and, always, aesthetic effect, what the writing meant to the reader. Indeed the title signalled something more: that for Hunter no Elizabethan writer would be &#145;obscure&#146;, would forgo his attention. It was at Oxford that he met Shelagh Kathleen Edmunds (<i>b</i>. 1924), later a distinguished Victorianist (daughter of Christopher Montague Edmunds, principal of Birmingham School of Music); they married at the parish church in Solihull, Warwickshire, on 16 December 1950. Theirs was a partnership based as much on intellectual as domestic productivity, hers the editorial eye that had to be satisfied before anything he wrote was finished. They had three children, Mary, Andrew, and Ruth, who remembered lives full of books and conversation, and a father, passionate about football, theatre, family sing-songs, and games, who regularly trounced them at Scrabble by putting vowel-less Anglo-Saxonisms on the board.<br>
<br>Hunter had in 1948, even before completing his DPhil thesis, been appointed an assistant lecturer at University College, Hull; this was converted to a full lectureship in 1950. Appointments followed at Reading (1955&#150;8), where he worked alongside Frank Kermode and J. B. Trapp developing a programme of comparative Renaissance studies in the English department, and at Liverpool (1958&#150;64), where Kenneth Muir was collecting a group of brilliant Shakespeareans. Hunter's first major publication, a superb <span class="italic">All's Well That Ends Well</span> (1959) for <span class="roman">Arden Shakespeare</span>, distinguished him as a meticulous editor, interested in the play's textual problems, but equally theatre-savvy, paying shrewd attention to what interested him as much: its performance possibilities. In 1962 appeared <span class="italic">John Lyly: the Humanist as Courtier</span>. Wry, witty, immensely learned, and positioning itself &#145;as part of the unceasing tug-of-war by which opinion comes to feel like understanding&#146;  (foreword, viii), this book effected a radical paradigm shift, establishing humanism (not, as C. S. Lewis had argued, medieval anti-secularism) as the defining Renaissance habit of mind.<br>
<br>In 1964 Hunter was among those pioneering academics recruited to the government's policy of expanding opportunity with the founding of seven new universities. Offered a professorship at the University of Warwick and free rein to develop the curriculum, he created a department of English and comparative literary studies that was socially diverse and based on an innovative programme that saw the European epic (from Homer to Milton) as its foundation and Shakespeare (taught as a jobbing playwright, writing for performance) as its climax. He head-hunted the brightest and best: among them Bernard Bergonzi, Claude Rawson (with whom he edited the <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span>), William Righter, and Germaine Greer. On a bulldozer-scarred campus under construction that looked more like Wilfred Owen's Somme than Blake's New Jerusalem, he built a department on intellectual excitement: engaged not just in reading literature but in imagining what a university could be.<br>
<br>Hunter crossed the Atlantic in 1976, leaving Warwick for Yale, as a professor of English. Landing there in the middle of the &#145;deconstruction wars&#146;, this once-radical humanist found himself cast, ironically, as a reactionary in battles between &#145;tradition&#146; and &#145;theory&#146;. Disenchanted with the academic posturing of both sides, in 1985 he accepted the chairmanship of the PhD programme in Renaissance studies, an appointment he found challenging and rewarding. Given more time for writing, he brought to completion the <span class="roman">Oxford History of English Literature</span>, a series begun in 1935, producing the final volume, <span class="italic">English Drama, 1586&#150;1642</span> (1997). At Yale, Hunter was appointed Emily Sanford professor of English in 1987, and elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1978) and a corresponding fellow of the British Academy (1988). He nevertheless remained thoroughly unpretentious, and unimpressed by status and honours; on the occasion of Shakespeare's quatercentenary in 1964 his seven-year-old son Andrew had recorded in his school diary that &#145;This morning my Mum and Dad had an invitation to tea with the Queen. They are not going as Dad says it will be ded boring&#146;  (Rawson, 2).<br>
<br>Hunter's brilliance as a teacher and a scholar was an ability to ask disarmingly simple questions, such as wondering what the theatrical purpose of Othello's blackness might have been, that, answered, conducted students on astonishing journeys through history and myth, across maps, looking at etymology, demographics, visual and print culture, Elizabethan playhouse practice, all brought to focus on close readings of the text. His essays, collected in <span class="italic">Dramatic Identities and Cultural Tradition</span> (1978), demonstrate a mind scaled to Falstaff's girth. Properly combative, suffering no fool gladly, Hunter disdained academic cant and pretence (though the acerbity of his wit cutting some young Turk down to size was mollified by the voice, the burr of the Glasgow accent that never abandoned him). He taught students that the values and humanity that are expressed in great literature are worth fighting for.<br>
<br>Hunter retired in 1991, and (having lived since 1976 in New Haven) in 2007, with his wife, Shelagh, moved to Topsham, Maine, where he died after complications arising from Alzheimer's on 10 April 2008. He was cremated at Gracelawn Memorial Park, Auburn, Maine. Memorial services were held on 12 May 2008 at St Martins-in-the-Field Church, Finham, Coventry, and on 13 September 2008 at Davenport College, Yale University. His wife and their three children survived him.<br>
