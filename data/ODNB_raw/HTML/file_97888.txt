<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Arthur Owen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Owen Rhoscomyl]</span>  (1863&#150;1919), <span class="occ">author and patriot</span>, was born at Tulketh Street, Southport, Lancashire, on 6 September 1863, the son of Robert Mills (1829&#150;1863), master stonemason, and his wife, Jane Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scowfield or Schofield (1835&#150;1869). His name at birth was Robert Scowfield Mills. His father died before his birth was registered. In 1865 his mother married Luke Etchells, an iron moulder; she too died while he was an infant. Brought up in the household of his stepfather in Droylsden, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Ann Jones Gill, a native of Tremeirchion in Flintshire, who heavily influenced his character with romantic tales of Wales and Welsh martial heroes.<br>
<br>When his grandmother died in 1879, the fifteen-year-old Mills set out for America, where he worked as a cowboy, prospector, and hunter in the open ranges and mountains of Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. He returned to Manchester in 1886, adopting the name Milne. After failing in his attempts to join Stanley's Emin Pasha expedition in 1887 he joined the 1st (Royal) Dragoons. He proved to be a talented soldier but ran into financial trouble and class prejudice. In 1890 Elizabeth Surtees-Allnatt, aged seventy-one, a wealthy and socially well-connected widow, took him under her wing, encouraging his interest in history, literature, and invention. She purchased his commission and he left the army in 1890 to travel and continue literary pursuits with her. At some point in the 1890s the relationship between them was severed.<br>
<br>By the spring of 1896 Milne was living in a cottage in Conwy, Caernarvonshire. Excited by the Young Wales movement, he came to identify the Welsh people as his own. Envisaging himself as a Cymric Sir Walter Scott, he wrote for local papers, published short stories, contributed to O. M. Edward's periodical <span class="italic">Wales</span> and other nationalist journals, and wrote a series of swashbuckling Welsh historical romances under the pen name Owen Rhoscomyl, an amalgamation of his birth names. He claimed to have worked as a mercenary, fighting in South America and in the Spanish-American War.<br>
<br>When the South African War began in 1899, Milne made his way to South Africa under the alias Arthur Owen Vaughan, as he would henceforth be known. The former cowboy found good company in a series of hard riding irregular units, including Rimington's Guides, Damant's Horse, and the Canadian Scouts, in which he was commissioned as a captain in 1901. He was known for his bravery, was mentioned in dispatches and received the Distinguished Conduct Medal. In December 1900 he married a young woman of the veldt, Catherine Lois Geere (1882&#150;1927), in a ceremony kept secret from her family, some of whom were fighting the British. His wife was later interned in the Vredefort concentration camp, where three members of her family died, before being reunited with Vaughan following the war. As a leader of scouts, Vaughan was involved in the war's brutality. In January 1902 he led an assault against a farmhouse marked as a Red Cross hospital, shooting a nurse several times in the confusion. The protests of General de Wet were dismissed by General Kitchener, who claimed the attack on the hospital had been provoked by a body of armed Boers who had fled the farmhouse some moments earlier. Although badly wounded, the nurse, Lily Rautenbach, forgave him at the site and came to outlive him. After the war he led a frustrated effort to relocate the Welsh colony in Patagonia to South Africa.<br>
<br>After returning to Wales Vaughan settled with his family at Arthog in Merioneth, and later at Dinas Powys in Glamorgan. He wrote novels, short stories and essays, including his semi-autobiographical novel of the South African War, <span class="italic">Old Fireproof</span> (1906). While fiction was his main source of income, Welsh history and lore remained his true passion and ambition. In 1905 he published <span class="italic">Flame-bearers of Welsh History</span>, a romantic history of Wales written in English for the nation's youth. He was determined to establish that the Welsh were the descendants not of the demoralized and defeated Britons who had fled from the Saxons but of a vibrant, conquering race, the sons of Cunedda from the north. Believing that the medieval Welsh genealogies were the key to proving his theories, he threw himself into the study of these materials in the hope of producing a definitive history of Wales.<br>
<br>With the support of the nationalist Sir Thomas Marchant Williams, Vaughan was invited to script the National Pageant of Wales in Cardiff in 1909. A grand spectacle performed by a cast of thousands, the pageant gave Vaughan further fame and popularized his highly romantic vision of Welsh history. Through his work on the pageant he met his friend and patron Thomas Scott-Ellis, Lord Howard de Walden. Fascinated by his own Welsh heritage, Howard de Walden took up residence in Chirk Castle and engaged in a variety of projects to support the culture of Wales. Vaughan was placed at the forefront of these efforts, acting as manager of Howard de Walden's project for the National Theatre of Wales (1913&#150;14). Vaughan pursued his own campaign of patriotic activity, launching projects and championing causes further to dignify and develop the sinews of the Welsh nation. He organized a movement in Cardiff to revive the investiture of the prince of Wales (1911) as a public celebration of Welsh nationhood. Although the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> hailed the event as Vaughan's personal triumph, the royal ritual took place in circumstances that denied Vaughan any official role. His projected multi-volume historical masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Matter of Wales</span>, never materialized except for a poorly received preliminary volume that appeared in 1913.<br>
<br>While devoted to Wales, Vaughan saw himself as an active patriot of the British empire. In 1904 he helped found the Legion of Frontiersmen, the brainchild of the adventurer and writer Roger Pocock. Rather than a mere fraternal order, the legion was envisioned as a far-flung network of volunteers whose frontier and maritime skills equipped them to carry out acts of espionage for the British empire. When the Secret Service was formed in 1909, Vaughan claimed to be connected to it and is said to have played some role in the planning of counter-espionage and insurgency during the German invasion scare. Known as a quick draw and expert shot, Vaughan was called upon to attend the king as a discreetly armed bodyguard during the royal visit to south Wales in 1912.<br>
<br>During the First World War Vaughan advocated that Wales raise a distinctly national unit, led by Welsh officers, marching beneath the dragon standard and equipped with items of Welsh manufacture. With the idea of creating the nucleus of a Welsh regiment of guards, he quickly raised a regiment of Welsh horse but the War Office denied him command in favour of Lord Kensington. Eventually joining the Northumberland Fusiliers as a major, he was lent to other regiments and served in a variety of places on the western front. The London correspondent for the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> believed that in his wandering Vaughan was acting as the agent of David Lloyd George. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant-colonel in 1917 and given a series of commands in the labour corps, where he was said to have restored morale and discipline. He was twice mentioned in dispatches and was appointed to the DSO.<br>
<br>Vaughan died in a London nursing home, at 49 Beaumont Street, of liver cancer, on 15 October 1919. He was buried three days later in the churchyard of St Thomas, Rhyl, where after some difficulty a Celtic cross was raised by public subscription. On Lloyd George's recommendation he was posthumously made MBE. He left a very small estate, and despite the aid of Howard de Walden, his widow and their four children, Rhys (<i>b</i>. 1903), Olwen (<i>b</i>. 1904), Nest (<i>b</i>. 1906), and Emrys Llewelyn (<i>b</i>. 1907), struggled with poverty.<br>
