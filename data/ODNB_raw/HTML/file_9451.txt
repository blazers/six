<span class="headword">Findlater,  Charles</span>  (1754&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer on agriculture</span>, was born on 10 January 1754 in the manse of West Linton, Peeblesshire, the second son of Thomas Findlater (1697&#150;1778) and his second wife, Jean Brown (<i>d</i>. 1802), daughter of William Brown, an Edinburgh bookseller. His grandfather, Alexander Findlater, was a native of Moray in the north of Scotland, and had married into the famous Scottish family Kirkaldy of Grange. His father was minister of West Linton, but as he had been presented by a lay patron, his settlement there in 1729 was resolutely opposed by certain of the parishioners, who staged a riot which caused troops to be quartered in the parish.<br>
<br>Findlater was educated at Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA on 14 November 1770. Having been licensed by the presbytery of Peebles in 1775, he was called to the parish of West Linton, where he was ordained as his father's assistant and successor on 6 March 1777. He remained as minister there until 1790, when he was presented by William, duke of Queensberry, to the neighbouring parish of Newlands, where he was admitted on 24 June. His appointment, like his father's at West Linton, was opposed, and led to the establishment of a seceding congregation. On 26 July of the following year he married Janet Hay Russell (1760/61&#150;1828).<br>
<br>Findlater belonged to the moderate theological school, and was extremely popular with his parishioners, often inviting his congregation to dinner on Sundays. He was interested in economic subjects, establishing one of the first local savings banks some time after 1791. Findlater's books show him to have been well read in politics and economics. He published <span class="italic">Liberty and equality: a sermon or essay, with an appendix on Godwin's system of society in his &#145;Political justice&#146;</span> (1800), an attack on the principles of the French Revolution, which he saw William Godwin as promoting. Godwin's sympathizers assaulted Findlater, and he was obliged to hide himself until the lord advocate, his friend and neighbour Sir James Montgomery, to whom the sermon had been dedicated, was able to appease the outcry. Findlater also wrote a <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of the County of Peebles</span>, published in Edinburgh in 1802. This is an eclectic, rather than an instructive, work. It states that pigeons and bees are disadvantageous to the Peebles farmers, who are commended for their sobriety and industry; however there is no mention of either the game or the fish of the county. He also published sermons, which dealt with politics and economics, and wrote the entries on West Linton and Newlands parishes which appear in Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span> and the <span class="italic">New Statistical Account</span>.<br>
<br>Following his wife's accidental death on 2 August 1828, Findlater remained as minister of Newlands until his retirement in 1835. He died in Glasgow on 28 May 1838 and was buried at Newlands.<br>
