<span class="headword">Bockman,  Gerhard</span>  (1686&#150;1773), <span class="occ">portrait painter and engraver</span>, is believed to have been born in the Netherlands, at Amsterdam. He worked in Britain from at least 1711 until his death, painting and copying portraits, and engraving portraits in mezzotint after both his own work and that of others. Notable among his own works are a life-size, half-length portrait, <span class="italic">Admiral Russell</span> (date unknown; Maritime Hospital, Greenwich), the <span class="italic">Coningsby Family</span> (date unknown), and <span class="italic">St Dunstan Holding the Devil by the Nose with a Pair of Tongs</span>. His engraving of this last is signed with his name, with the addition &#145;pinx.et sculp 1743&#146; (impression in the British Museum department of prints and drawings). As many as nine copies by Bockman after Kneller are in the Royal Collection at Hampton Court Palace. He engraved over twenty portraits, mostly after other artists including Van Dyck, Van Loo, and Michael Dahl, four being after James Worsdale. Portraits engraved after his own work include the <span class="italic">Duke of Cumberland</span> (1746, impression in the British Museum department of prints and drawings). Most of Bockman's engravings were commissioned. He published only three mezzotints himself: <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Reeve</span>, after Jacopo Amigoni (<i>c</i>.1737), <span class="italic">Charles, Lord Talbot</span> (<i>c</i>.1737, impression in the British Museum department of prints and drawings), and the <span class="italic">Children of Frederick, Prince of Wales</span>, after Enoch Seeman (date unknown, impression in the British Museum department of prints and drawings).<br>
<br>Bockman's portraiture is notable for its similarity to Kneller's treatment of faces and his arrangement of poses. Although his obituarist recorded that he was &#145;the last surviving disciple of Sir Godfrey Kneller&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>), suggestions that he was a pupil of Kneller appear to be unfounded, and nothing is known about his education. It is possible that the two had a close association before or not long after 1711, when the Academy of Drawing and Painting in Great Queen Street, London, was founded, with Kneller as its president, and Bockman, spelt Borman by Vertue in his list of members, as one of its students, aged twenty-five. Bockman was also listed by Vertue as a member of the Rose and Crown Club in 1724. Previous biographical outlines of Bockman have been uncertain as to whether his initial was C, G, or R (his prints show it clearly to be G), and by Redgrave's incorrect statement that Bockman's widow applied for relief to the Society of Artists in 1769. Very little is known of Bockman's personal life. The identities of his parents are not known, and there is no evidence he was married or had children. He is not recorded as having left a will. He lived in London at Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury (about 1737), and King Street, Covent Garden (in the 1740s). He died on 2 April 1773 &#145;at his home in Tash Street, Gray's Inn Lane&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
