<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rayner,  Derek George</span>, Baron Rayner  (1926&#150;1998), <span class="occ">businessman and civil servant</span>, was born at 47 Waterloo Road, Norwich, on 30 March 1926, the son of George William Rayner, a shoe finisher, and his wife, Hilda Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rant. He had a comfortable upbringing and was educated at the City College, Norwich, before going to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he read theology. His initial intention was to enter holy orders, but he decided against this and after a national service commission in the RAF (1946&#150;8) he started a career as the manager of a small &#145;fancy goods&#146; retail business in Norwich. The failure of this venture, due mainly to a lack of capital, marked the start of his career at Marks and Spencer where he became a trainee manager in 1953. It was during his time as a trainee at the Oxford Street store that his talents were first recognized by the chairman, Marcus Sieff. Well educated and tall, Rayner most probably stood out from the average shop assistant, and Sieff was impressed by his knowledge of food retailing. He was quickly transferred to the organization's head office at Baker Street where he worked mainly in the food business.<br>
<br>In 1967 Rayner joined the management board. He was first and foremost a retailer and took an expert interest in the design, quality, and value-for-money aspects of Marks and Spencer. His business talents and transparent integrity were also recognized outside of retailing, and in 1970 the prime minister, Edward Heath, seconded Rayner into government service. He was placed in the defence procurement agency within the Ministry of Defence, where he became chief executive in 1971. Knighted in 1973, he returned to Marks and Spencer as a joint managing director, but the period up to 1983 was marked by a division of his time between the retail trade and government work. When Margaret Thatcher formed her first government in 1979 she also called upon Rayner to bring the cost-control techniques of Marks and Spencer into the civil service. Although he was well attuned to Thatcher's way of thinking, he always resisted suggestions that he was concerned only with cutting costs. Nevertheless his so-called efficiency unit did make large savings, and across some 135 government departments an estimated 10,000 jobs were cut. There were successes, most notably the simplification of the unemployment benefit system, but on the whole he failed to produce radical reforms. There were also more lasting criticisms, such as those relating to his attempts to cut costs at the central statistical office, which many believed led to a loss of reliable official statistics.<br>
<br>In 1983 Rayner received a life peerage, becoming Baron Rayner of Crowborough, and returned to the full-time post of chief executive at Marks and Spencer, taking over as chairman from Lord Sieff in the following year. He was the first head of the company to be neither a family member nor Jewish, and it is to the credit of the Sieff family that they recognized his strong talents. During the early 1980s the company was starting to feel the pressure from new competitors in the high street and beginning to lose its supremacy. Rayner set about modernizing Marks and Spencer with a series of broad-ranging strategies all tied to new approaches, while retaining the company's traditions. Some have argued that he was not so much a breath of fresh air in the company as a force-nine gale. He was autocratic in his management style and had little tolerance for long discussions at business meetings. He led strategic developments overseas and took Marks and Spencer to the United States through the takeover of the Brook Brothers menswear chain. This was the start of a global strategy that saw the company expand into the Middle and Far East as well as continental Europe. The internationalization process did bring problems, especially in North America, where the company had to close stores in Canada, while operations in the USA proved too expensive, and yielded poor returns. A second of Rayner's reforms involved moving into &#145;out of town&#146; sites, the first at the Metro-Centre at Gateshead. This marked a break with the high street tradition, but opened up important new opportunities. Other successful experiments involved the introduction of financial services for customers, alongside the St Michael chargecard and new lines of merchandise, including household goods and furniture. Of equal importance was Rayner's introduction of improved financial controls and the increased use of information technology throughout the company. These innovations restored the fortunes of the company and made it one of the most successful retailers in the world during the 1990s. Despite his efforts the North American operations did not go well. However, under Rayner's chairmanship, the company doubled its sales and pre-tax profits. He retired as chairman in 1991.<br>
<br>Rayner was a complex man, possessing a curious mixture of assurance, toughness, shyness, and a degree of sensitivity. This complexity was reflected in his beliefs, since he claimed that the study of theology as a student had stopped him believing. However, he had a lifelong striving for a sense of purpose, which involved a constant questioning of his life. This did not produce an introverted character, but rather someone with ambition, drive, and a love of the good things in life. He was a genial man of considerable charm. He found happiness and relaxation in good food, travel, and gardening. After his retirement from Marks and Spencer he became a keen gardener at his home in Crowborough, Sussex. His main joy was in classical music, especially Bach and Haydn, and choral music. In spite of his busy life, he found time to be president of St Bartholomew's Hospital medical college, trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and chairman of the Coronary Artery Disease Research Association. Rayner never married, though he did strike up some long-standing intimate friendships. He died at Ashford Hospital, Stanwell, Surrey, on 26 June 1998.<br>
