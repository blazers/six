<span class="headword">Bardsley,  Samuel Argent</span>  (1764&#150;1850), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of James Bardsley and his wife, Felicia Stephana Browne, was born at Kelvedon, Essex, on 27 April 1764. In 1778 he entered into an apprenticeship with Benjamin Maddock, a surgeon apothecary of Nottingham. After completing the apprenticeship he studied medicine at London, Edinburgh, and Leiden, where he was a student from 1786 to 1789. He graduated MD and then practised for a short time at Doncaster, before moving to the Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1790 as honorary physician. His election to this post followed the introduction of new rules which enlarged the medical staff of the hospital.<br>
<br>Through his work at the infirmary, particularly with home patients, Bardsley became active in the 1790s in campaigns for the containment and treatment of fever. As an infirmary physician he became a member of the board of health established in 1795, and in the following year he published a paper outlining his concerns for the health of children employed in cotton mills. For the children, many of whom worked long hours, Bardsley advocated the benefits of cleanliness and ventilation, and in 1801 the board of health published his <span class="italic">Advice to the Poor</span>, which again stressed the value of cleanliness and fresh air. In 1807 Bardsley published <span class="italic">Medical Reports of Cases and Experiments</span>, which contained his observations on diabetes, rheumatism, and hydrophobia.<br>
<br>Bardsley played an active role in the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, acting as secretary from 1793 to 1796 and vice-president from 1797 to 1808. To this society he contributed the papers &#145;Party prejudice&#146; (1798) and &#145;The use and abuse of popular sports and exercises&#146; (1803). He later became involved in the Royal Institution (established 1816), attending many of the meetings and lectures even after his retirement from practice.<br>
<br>In August 1823 Bardsley wrote to the infirmary to resign his appointment as honorary physician, and in the same letter he recommended his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1362/', "James Lomax Bardsley (1801&#150;1876)")</script>, as his successor; the latter was duly elected. After his resignation Samuel Bardsley continued to maintain an active interest in the affairs of the hospital. In 1827 he successfully opposed a proposal to increase the number of honorary infirmary posts. Two years later he became physician-extraordinary, a position he retained until his death.<br>
<br>Until 1827 Bardsley continued to practise from his rooms in Chatham Street, Manchester, where he had lived since 1794. He then gave up his rooms to his nephew and moved locally to a house at Ardwick Green. Bardsley died on 29 May 1850 at Fairlight, near Hastings, while on a visit to a friend. He was buried at St Saviour's Church, Upper Brook Street, Manchester.<br>
