</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maltby,  Edward</span>  (1770&#150;1859), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was born on 6 April 1770 in the Norwich parish of St George Tombland, fourth son of George Maltby (1730/31&#150;1794), master weaver and merchant, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fearman (1737/8&#150;1804). He was baptized on 8 April by the Presbyterian Samuel Bourn, minister of the Octagon Chapel where George Maltby was deacon. The family was, however, well-disposed towards the established church: a memorial in the parish church commemorates Maltby's parents and grandparents, while in 1789 George and his brother each contributed 5 guineas to the parish augmentation fund.<br>
<br>Maltby entered Norwich grammar school in January 1778, a year before Samuel Parr became headmaster. Parr, an Anglican priest notorious for whiggery, respected dissenters and was Bourn's close friend. His influence on Maltby was profound. Parr retired in 1785; on his advice Maltby transferred to Winchester College, studying under Joseph Warton from 1785 to 1788. Taylor and Taylor's <span class="italic">History of the Octagon Chapel</span> states that he also studied under William Enfield. In 1784 his cousin Elizabeth Maltby married George Pretyman, later George Pretyman Tomline, confidant to Pitt the younger, who in 1787 became bishop of Lincoln. Pretyman entered Maltby at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1789.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Maltby won four medals, was 1791 Craven scholar, and graduated BA as eighth wrangler in 1792, MA in 1794, BD in 1801, and DD in 1806. Unlike his cousin William, he conformed to the Church of England and took his degrees without problem. In 1794 he became Pretyman's domestic chaplain, with a Lincoln prebend and two vicarages: Buckden in Huntingdonshire and Holbeach in Lincolnshire. On 10 July 1794 he married Mary, daughter of Jeremiah Ives Harvey of Catton, Norfolk, with whom he had at least four sons. His <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Truth of the Christian Religion</span>, published in 1802, enjoyed two further editions in 1803 and helped to establish his reputation as a whig &#145;bishop-in-waiting&#146;. However, the political upheavals of the new century stalled his career: his intervention in the 1807 Huntingdonshire elections, and an 1809 pamphlet denouncing the Portland administration's nepotism, stranded him at Buckden during the long tory political ascendancy, though, aided by Parr's influence with Canning, he became preacher of Gray's Inn in 1817 and was preacher of Lincoln's Inn from 1824 to 1835. In these years Maltby devoted himself to scholarship, publishing an 1815 <span class="italic">Lexicon Graeco-prosodiacum</span>, based on Thomas Morell's 1762 <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, which went through two full and three abridged editions, and co-compiling an 1815 hymn collection (revised 1824); a <span class="roman">New Testament</span> edition discussed with Parr was never completed. He also tutored private pupils, including E. B. Pusey. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1824 and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries by 1834. A committee member of Brougham's Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (founded in 1827), the Utilitarian counterblast to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, Maltby became a senator of University College, London, and offered the blessing prayer when its foundation stone was laid (1827). His first wife, Mary, died on 2 May 1825 and he remarried on 31 August 1826; his new wife was Margaret, youngest daughter of Major Green.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> crisis of November 1830 put Earl Grey in office, needing Maltby's vote in the House of Lords. Folliott Cornewall, bishop of Worcester, died in September 1831; Grey translated Carr of Chichester to Worcester and appointed Maltby to Chichester, so hastily that the <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> for Worcester arrived before Cornewall's funeral and caused a scandal. Maltby was in his place in time to vote for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in the House of Lords on 8 October 1831. The sole active whig among the episcopate&#151;Bathurst of Norwich was eighty-seven and incapacitated&#151;Maltby, branded a &#145;black swan&#146;, met the other bishops' hostility with plainspoken resolve to do his duty &#145;equally regardless of their smiles or their frowns&#146;  (Grant, 401&#150;3). A former schoolfellow at Winchester, Sydney Smith, disappointed to be passed over for the Chichester see, regarded him as an &#145;excellent man and a great fool&#146;  (P. Virgin, <span class="italic">Sydney Smith</span>, 1994, 27). Scandal certainly dogged his episcopate. He invited a Unitarian minister to a public dinner (1834), and did nothing to quieten the outcry by inviting a Catholic priest to dinner two weeks later.<br>
<br>Translated in March 1836 to be the first bishop of &#145;reformed&#146; Durham, Maltby had charge of the orb at Queen Victoria's coronation, but presented it at the wrong moment; the queen called him &#145;remarkably <i>maladroit</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, ed. A. C. Benson and Lord Esher, and G. E. Buckle, 1st ser., 1907, 1.155). In 1838 Maltby again outraged the orthodox when he and Bathurst's successor Stanley subscribed to a volume of sermons by the Unitarian William Turner. Charles Thorp, archdeacon of Durham, denounced Maltby in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and an effigy inscribed &#145;Unitarian Bishop&#146; was burnt in Bishop Auckland market place. He delivered a series of episcopal charges against Tractarianism from 1840 onwards, and in 1845 also attacked the evangelical party for &#145;believing that they alone possessed true understanding&#146;  (E. Maltby, <span class="italic">Charge</span>, 1845, 8). His continuing scholarly interests were reflected in calls for the training of ordinands to be based on sound biblical learning. He was a generous benefactor to Durham University (founded 1833) and helped negotiate its royal charter, even persuading the government to honour the agreement with his predecessor Van Mildert that students must subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> before graduation. In 1847 criticism arose over his income, which averaged about &pound;12,000 a year and in 1841 exceeded &pound;21,000, whereas the 1836 <span class="roman">Established Church Act</span> set it at &pound;8000 (reduced from &pound;19,000). In 1848 he established the Maltby Fund, giving more than &pound;21,000 over ten years for allocation by the ecclesiastical commissioners to parsonage building in Durham diocese.<br>
<br>Considered for archbishop of York in November 1847 by his friend Lord John Russell, Maltby declined; he was growing weary. In 1850 his letter to Russell denouncing the establishment of a Roman Catholic hierarchy in England inspired Russell's &#145;Durham Letter&#146;, which declared the Tractarians a worse threat. In 1855, eighty-five and nearly blind, he offered to retire on a &pound;4500 annuity from the Durham revenues. No bishop since the Reformation had been permitted retirement, and Gladstone denounced the pension request as simony; but after acrimonious debate an 1856 act of parliament granted both Maltby and Blomfield of London pensioned retirement. Maltby died on 3 July 1859 at his London residence, 1 Upper Portland Place; the <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary took one last swipe at his huge pension. Buried on 11 July at Kensal Green cemetery, London, he shared a family vault with his eldest brother.<br>
