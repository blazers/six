<span class="headword">Kissin,  Harry Aaron</span>, Baron Kissin  (1912&#150;1997), <span class="occ">businessman and financier</span>, was born on 23 August 1912 in Danzig, Germany, the son of Russian Jewish parents, Israel Kissin, grain merchant, and his wife, Reusi, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Model. He was brought up in Danzig and studied law at Basel University, Switzerland, where he afterwards practised as a lawyer until 1933 when he moved to London. His parents subsequently lived in Paris; after his father's death, his mother moved to London. On 1 June 1935 Kissin married Ruth Deborah Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1911), daughter of Siegmund Samuel. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In London Kissin initially worked for P. Winn's Produce Company Ltd, drug merchants and shellac and general importers and exporters, which had recently been established by Paul Winn &amp; Co. Ltd, general merchants. At this time he was especially friendly with Siegmund Warburg, Henry Grunfeld, and Eric Korner, then developing their financing and commodity broking business, New Trading Co., which in the post-war years emerged as the merchant bank of S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. During the Second World War Kissin was especially concerned with Barking Brassware Co., manufacturers of sanitary fittings and a connection of Winns, whose output he converted to shell production.<br>
<br>About 1947 Kissin established his own firm of G. H. Kay (Overseas), general import and export merchants, of Drapers Gardens, London, although he sustained his link with Winns as it shared the same address. His new firm quickly developed an important trading business with eastern Europe (especially Poland and Yugoslavia) and Latin America; it specialized in rubber. He was managing director and the largest single shareholder. Clement Davies, leader of the Liberal Party, and T. L. (Tom) Horabin, a Labour MP and business consultant, sat with him on the board.<br>
<br>At this time G. H. Kay developed business links with the well known and long established yet somewhat moribund commodity brokers, Lewis and Peat, of Mincing Lane. Soon Kissin acquired a controlling interest in this public company through another of his companies, Kay Finance Co. Boardroom conflict arose and in 1955 Kay orchestrated the resignation of several Lewis and Peat directors and obtained executive control. As major shareholder and as non-executive deputy chairman from 1954, managing director from 1958, and chairman from 1961, Kissin revived and expanded Lewis and Peat by diversifying it from broking into dealing and broadening the range of commodities and goods in which it dealt, often through the timely acquisition of ailing businesses. He was recognized as particularly adept at this and employed as his adviser S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. He also diversified Lewis and Peat into service provision to the commodity industry&#151;for example through insurance and ship broking&#151;and into processing commodities such as rubber and cocoa through the establishment of plant overseas. Profits grew from &pound;231,000 in 1961 to &pound;2.15 million a decade later. Under Kissin, Lewis and Peat emerged as a dynamic force amid the decaying commodity firms of Mincing Lane and Mark Lane which in the 1950s and 1960s for the most part failed to adapt to rapid structural change in their industry.<br>
<br>Kissin's management style was certainly energetic, hands-on, and at times ruthless. As with firms such as Warburgs, it marked him out as an outsider not above suspicion in the closed world of the City at that time. This did not, however, stand in his way in 1972 when he diversified Peats into financial services through its takeover of the privately owned and patrician merchant bank Guinness Mahon, although at the time the transaction was referred to as a merger. The acquisition of this business, with its membership of the prestigious Accepting Houses Committee, brought the Guinness Peat Group, as Kissin's firm was now known, into the mainstream of City business life.<br>
<br>In 1974 Kissin was created a life peer as Baron Kissin of Camden by Harold Wilson. He had known Wilson since the late 1940s when Wilson was president of the Board of Trade and when Kissin acted as the board's consultant on trade with China and the Far East. They became close friends. In the early 1950s Lewis and Peat appears to have employed Wilson as a consultant, although Kissin was always quite clear that he made no payments of any kind to him. Kissin supported the Labour Party&#151;for example, arranging the funding for vital private opinion polls during the 1974 election campaigns&#151;and joined the group of eastern European emigr&eacute; supporters and friends who gathered around Wilson. His elevation to a peerage coincided with the high point of his business career. In the 1970s Guinness Peat continued to prosper and when Kissin retired in 1979 his company was reckoned to be the 112th largest UK public company; he owned about 9 per cent of its equity.<br>
<br>After 1979 Kissin continued as life president of Guinness Peat and as a major shareholder, a combination which enabled him to exercise considerable influence and he did not flinch from doing so; the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> labelled him &#145;the ghost in the Guinness Peat boardroom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). His autocratic style had frequently brought him into conflict with colleagues and this was vividly underlined in 1982 in a power struggle with Edmund Dell, a former Labour secretary of state for trade and Kissin's successor as chairman and chief executive. Without Kissin's hands-on management, Guinness Peat soon lost its way, and in 1981&#150;2 chalked up losses of over &pound;30 million; a dispute between the two over a recovery programme led to a bitter and highly public power struggle which resulted in Dell being ousted. With the encouragement of the Bank of England, anxious to protect Guinness Mahon from the problems of the wider group, Alastair Morton was brought in as Dell's successor. His ruthless restructuring of the group became a cause of further public strife for Kissin, who sought to preserve the value of his still-considerable shareholding. The surviving parts, in which Kissin maintained shareholdings, were soon subject to hostile takeover or ran into difficulties in the recession of the early 1990s. As part of this restructuring, Kissin and his son led a management buy-out of the commodities division which subsequently traded as Lewis and Peat Holdings Ltd; Kissin was its chairman until 1987.<br>
<br>Away from business Kissin's charitable work reflected his informed interest in music. This led him to a directorship of the Royal Opera House from 1973 to 1984; he established and was first chairman, until 1980, of the Royal Opera House Trust, which raised funds for the first major extension to the house, completed in 1982. He was an amateur painter and chaired the council of the Institute of Contemporary Art from 1968 to 1975. He collected seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish pictures. He supported Jewish causes and Israel, where he was a governor of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design from 1975 to 1987, and of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1980. He was active in the House of Lords from the mid-1980s, sitting as a cross-bencher. He died of heart failure at 38 Hereford House, 66 North Row, Westminster, on 22 November 1997 and was buried at Bushey cemetery, Hertfordshire five days later. His wife survived him. A concert to celebrate his life was held at the Wigmore Hall, London, at which his relative, the leading Russian pianist Yevgeny Kissin, played.<br>
