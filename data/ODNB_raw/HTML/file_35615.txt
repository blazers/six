<span class="headword">Prinsep,  Valentine Cameron</span>  (1838&#150;1904), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born on St Valentine's day (14 February), 1838, at Calcutta, the second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22811/', "Henry Thoby Prinsep (1792&#150;1878)")</script>, Indian civil servant and author, and his wife, Sara Monckton (1816&#150;1887), one of seven &#145;singularly handsome&#146; daughters of James Pattle. Prinsep's parents retired to London in 1843, living first at 9 Chesterfield Street, and then from 1851 at Little Holland House on the Holland estate in Kensington, where they were joined the following year by the artist George Frederic Watts. Prinsep was educated at Haileybury College, with the expectation of joining the Indian Civil Service. However, even before leaving school in 1856 he had decided to become an artist. He was influenced by the salon his mother had established at Little Holland House around Watts. The guests, almost all of whom became Prinsep's friends, included Tennyson, Thackeray, Browning, Holman Hunt, Millais, Leighton, D. G. Rossetti, and Burne-Jones; Sara Prinsep's sister, Julia Margaret Cameron, took photographs of the group.<br>
<br>With financial support from his father and tuition from Watts, Prinsep embarked on a career which brought him recognition by his peers as a dedicated artist, though never of the first rank: &#145;well known in Art and highly esteemed in Society &hellip; a thorough artist in his aspirations, a fine painter, and a right good honest man&#146;  (<span class="italic">VF</span>, 23). His engaging personality made him welcome in the country houses of the aristocracy and newly rich industrialists, in London clubs and theatres; his large build and shock of hair earned him the nickname Buzz. In 1857 he came under the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism when invited by Rossetti to help decorate the Union debating hall in Oxford with scenes from Sir Thomas Malory's <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span>. He chose the story of <span class="italic">Sir Pelleas and the Lady Etarde</span>. In 1859 he took a studio in Charlotte Street, London, close to Burne-Jones, travelled in Italy with him, and exhibited, for the first time, <span class="italic">The Queen was in the Parlour Eating Bread and Honey</span> at the Hogarth Club (Manchester City Art Galleries). The first of his paintings to be exhibited at the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">How Bianco Capello Sought to Poison her Brother-in-Law the Cardinal de Medici</span> (1862), was still influenced by the movement and shortly before his death he wrote, for the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span> (1904), an entertaining account of his early experiences with Rossetti.<br>
<br>Prinsep studied at Gleyre's atelier in Paris from 1859 to 1860. Shortly after returning to London he became friends with George Du Maurier, who had also attended the atelier and used Prinsep as a model for Taffy in his novel <span class="italic">Trilby</span> (1894). Du Maurier introduced Prinsep to the artists of the St John's Wood clique, who became the next major influence on his work. <span class="italic">Home from the Gleaning</span> (exh. RA, 1875) and <span class="italic">The Linen Gatherers</span> (exh. RA, 1876) are strongly influenced by two members of this eclectic group, Frederick Walker and George Heming Mason. Prinsep's closest friend was Frederic Leighton, whom he first met at Little Holland House about 1856. In 1860 both joined the 38th Middlesex (Artists') rifle volunteer corps, from which Prinsep retired as major in 1885; four years later they acquired neighbouring plots of land in Holland Park Road on which to build studio-houses. Prinsep's costs were paid by his father; Philip Webb, who had recently completed the Red House for William Morris, was his architect. Though considerably altered, the house survives (14 Holland Park Road).<br>
<br>Through his father's Indian connections Prinsep was commissioned by Lord Lytton, viceroy of India, to paint the Delhi imperial assemblage to celebrate Queen Victoria's accession to the title empress of India in 1877 (Royal Collection). The 27 foot-long painting received a mixed reception when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1880. <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> referred to it as &#145;that Eastern monstrosity&#146;. However, the commission resulted in Prinsep's election as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1878 and in a number of fine paintings based on his Indian travels: <span class="italic">A Nautch Girl</span> (exh. RA, 1878) and <span class="italic">The Roum-i-Sultana</span> (exh. RA, 1879) were bought by the prince of Wales (Royal Collection). Prinsep wrote a lively account of the visit, <span class="italic">Imperial India: an Artist's Journals</span> (1879). He also tried his hand at writing plays while completing the durbar painting. He was a friend of the actor John Hare, painting his portrait in 1879. The same year Hare produced and acted in Prinsep's two plays: <span class="italic">Cousin Dick</span>, at the Court Theatre, and <span class="italic">Monsieur le duc</span>, at the St James's. Later Prinsep wrote two novels: <span class="italic">Virginie: a Tale of one Hundred Years Ago</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">The Story of Abibal the Tsourian</span> (1893).<br>
<br>On 28 July 1884 Prinsep married Florence (<i>b</i>. 1859), daughter of Frederick Richard Leyland (1831&#150;1892), a Liverpool shipping millionaire and patron of Rossetti, Burne-Jones, and Whistler. Florence's annual income was reputed to be &pound;10,000, and Prinsep was now a wealthy man (Leighton had given him financial support after his father's death). Prinsep joined the boards of shipping and investment companies, he extended his London house, bought property by the sea at Pevensey, and acquired an apartment on the Grand Canal in Venice.<br>
<br>Prinsep continued to paint, exhibiting at the Royal Academy every year until his death. He was elected a royal academician in 1894 and was appointed professor of painting in 1901 (his lectures were privately published in 1901 and 1902). Of his later works, <span class="italic">At the Golden Gate</span> (exh. RA, 1882; Manchester City Art Galleries) and <span class="italic">Ayesha</span> (exh. RA, 1887; Tate Collection) are orientalist in style: his diploma work, <span class="italic">La r&eacute;volution</span> (exh. RA, 1896), is a historical piece, set during the French Revolution. He also painted his wife and their three sons, Thoby, Anthony, and Nicholas, as well as commissioned portraits. A number of his works are in the South London Art Gallery. Prinsep died on 11 November 1904 at Welbeck House, Welbeck Street, London, after a prostate operation and was buried in the Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
