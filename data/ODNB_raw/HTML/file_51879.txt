<span class="headword">Lithgow family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">shipbuilders and industrialists</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_51879"></a><span class="headword">William Todd Lithgow</span>  (1854&#150;1908), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, and his sons, James and Henry. Born at Port Glasgow, William Todd Lithgow was the second son of James Lithgow (<i>d</i>. 1870), a cotton yarn merchant, and his wife, Margaret MacNicol (<i>d</i>. 1861). His father had moved from Glasgow to Greenock before setting up in Port Glasgow in 1856. Lithgow became a premium apprentice with the old-established Port Glasgow shipbuilder John Reid &amp; Co., and he was trained as a ship's draughtsman just at the time when the River Clyde was emerging as the main seat of iron and steam shipbuilding in Britain.<br>
<br>The young William Todd Lithgow had little opportunity to draw on family support in developing his career: his mother died when he was only seven, and his father died in 1870 when William was still only sixteen and had barely begun his apprenticeship. By 1874 he was acting draughtsman for John Reid &amp; Co. and he had invested his &pound;1000 patrimony in a new partnership with an experienced shipbuilder, Joseph Russell, and another young man, Anderson Rodger. The firm of Russell &amp; Co. had a capital of &pound;7000&#151;&pound;5000 from Russell with &pound;1000 each from the two young men. The new firm did not try to rival the emerging metal and steam shipyards which required large capitals, but concentrated on exploiting the opportunity of the depression years of 1874&#150;9 by building large, simple, iron-hulled sailing ships, designed for long hauls of bulk commodities which did not have to meet urgent delivery deadlines. From the outset Lithgow influenced the company in designing semi-standard bulk cargo sailing vessels with interchangeable components and crew-saving devices, and the company also helped to sell its ships by taking shares with the shipowners. The formula was simple, but effective.<br>
<br>The new company leased its shipyard, the Bay Yard, and by 1879, as the depression eased, extended its capacity by leasing a second yard, the Cartsdyke Yard at Port Glasgow. Two years later in 1881 it purchased the site of what was to be its main yard, the Kingston Yard, establishing there a new yard with six berths. Between 1874 and 1881 William Todd Lithgow's investment of &pound;1000 had grown to &pound;4893, and he had also withdrawn &pound;7830 from the business, of which &pound;4951 had been reinvested in ships. As Lithgow's fortune prospered, in 1879 he married; his wife was Agnes Birkmyre, daughter of Henry Birkmyre, rope manufacturer, whose family owned the Gourock Rope Company and were also substantial shipowners. The couple had two sons. The elder, <a name="cosubject_34555"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Lithgow</span>, first baronet  (1883&#150;1952)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 27 January 1883 at Huntly Bank, Port Glasgow. The same year his parents established the family home at Drums, at Langbank, overlooking the Clyde, where his brother, <a name="cosubject_51880"></a><span class="headword">Henry Lithgow</span>  (1886&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 23 December 1886.<br>
<br>The 1880s were a busy period for the firm of Russell &amp; Co., in which Lithgow acted as the chief designer. While the relationships between Lithgow and the older partner, Joseph Russell, were amicable, that with Anderson Rodger was strained and Lithgow indicated a desire to leave the partnership in 1889. He was dissuaded from doing so by Russell, who offered to withdraw himself from the partnership to leave Lithgow in control; matters, however, deteriorated and in 1891, with Rodger ill, Lithgow again sought to leave the partnership; it was dissolved by mutual agreement on 30 November 1891, leaving Lithgow as sole proprietor of Russell &amp; Co. operating from the Cartsdyke and Kingston yards; Rodger retained the Bay Yard and continued to build independently. That Joseph Russell was close to William Lithgow is clear in the terms of the settlement. Russell lent Lithgow &pound;122,965 to buy out Rodger and set up his own operations; Russell also continued to act as a bookkeeper for Lithgow and as an adviser on the purchasing of timber. By 1891 Lithgow's capital in the business had grown to &pound;159,386. In addition, since 1874 he had withdrawn capital of &pound;67,940, of which &pound;40,681 was reinvested in ships. Russell's judgement of Lithgow was that he was &#145;very clever, sharp, light headed but strong willed&#146;. This had been amply borne out by Lithgow's rapid progress in business.<br>
<br>Under Lithgow's sole control the firm of Russell &amp; Co. prospered, and by the mid-1890s was transferring its formula of constructing standard cargo ships to a new generation of through-deck tramp steamers, of between 4000 and 5000 gross registered tons. He also began concentrating more on steamship construction and the last sailing vessel was launched in 1894. Profitability remained strong in these years, rising from &pound;15,500 in 1899 to &pound;123,601 by 1901, the year in which William Todd Lithgow brought his elder son, James, into the business as an apprentice. With an eye to diversifying and securing his personal wealth, William Todd Lithgow ceased investing in shipping and transferred into equities, purchasing almost &pound;200,000 worth of stock between 1901 and 1903, while at the same time buying a country estate, Ormsary, in Knapdale, Argyll, in 1902. Large capitals of &pound;313,304 were withdrawn from the business between 1903 and 1906, most of this being transferred as <i>inter vivos</i> gifts to his sons; the younger son, Henry, took up his apprenticeship in 1905.<br>
<br>Even as the family business grew in wealth and prosperity, William Todd Lithgow declined, his health breaking early in 1907. Before the end of the year he had undergone surgery for stomach cancer and in November 1907 he brought his two sons into full partnership, while his long-time friend Joseph Russell came out of retirement to help the young men run the business. The founder of the family business and fortune died from cancer on 7 June 1908 at Drums, at the early age of fifty-three. His business career had lasted only twenty-six years, in which he had turned his &pound;1000 investment into a fortune of about &pound;2.2 million; his personal estate at death was valued at &pound;1,000,237, of which &pound;102,000 was invested in shipping, but he had also made cumulative drawings of nearly &pound;1,240,000 from the business during his working life. His sons inherited the leading cargo construction yard on the Clyde, but they themselves were only twenty-five and twenty-two, with little experience of the business.<br>
<br>At the time of their father's death the two brothers still lived at Drums; they had been schooled together by private tutor before both going to Glasgow Academy and then serving their apprenticeships. They were remarkably close, sharing a staunch Presbyterian upbringing and outlook, and were deeply attached to the attractions of the grouse and deer shoots on the family estate at Ormsary. They were a complementary team, James taking the lead as the elder, while Henry supported and followed in his path, although later correspondence shows that once Henry had made up his mind his elder brother often recognized that he could not be persuaded to another course of action. Where James could be abrupt and forceful, Henry was a man who liked to take time to think over a problem and in this he was a moderating influence on his brother. It is clear that they trusted each other completely and that in business no important matter was ever entered into that did not have both brothers' full support and approval.<br>
<br>In the six years between their father's death and the beginning of the First World War James and Henry Lithgow quickly grew into the control of their family business, and began to lay the foundations for expansion. In 1911 the original yard of Russell &amp; Co., the Bay Yard, was acquired on the death of Anderson Rodger; this added to the Lithgow capacity while ensuring that no newcomer could set up business in the Lithgow domain at Port Glasgow. At the same time, James Lithgow took a first step into wider industry affairs, becoming vice-president of the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association; he was its president in 1912&#150;13. It was there that he met and formed a friendship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32929/', "Andrew Rae Duncan")</script>, an industrial lawyer who became secretary of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, then a director and industrial adviser to the Bank of England and chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board. He was to be greatly influential in bringing James Lithgow into public affairs and involving him in industrial reconstruction in the 1930s. Before the war, the only other involvement that James Lithgow had outside the business was in the volunteer force of the Port Glasgow company of the first Renfrew and Dumbarton Royal Garrison Artillery. He had been involved in this since 1905 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. When the volunteer force became the Territorial Army in 1908, James Lithgow was promoted to the rank of captain. This involvement was a deliberate choice of the two brothers; the elder took on the public responsibility in case of war, while the younger Henry was to concentrate on the shipyard management. Consequently when war did come James spent the first year and a half manning the river defence unit at Fort Matilda in Greenock. In summer 1915 he and his men were sent to Plymouth and then to Lydd in Kent to train with new howitzers. The battery finally sailed for France in February 1916 and James Lithgow spent the next fifteen months at the western front, gained the Military Cross, and advanced to the rank of brevet colonel.<br>
<br>In contrast Henry kept control in the Port Glasgow yards and proved to be a tough and capable manager, maintaining production under difficult conditions while being forcefully critical of the way the government squandered effort and resources in ship construction. During these years, with the agreement of his brother, Henry took the chance to expand the business. In 1915 the Lithgows took over the local yard of Robert Duncan &amp; Co., and in 1917 bought into David Rowan &amp; Co., marine engineers at Govan in Glasgow.<br>
<br>From letters written to Henry it is clear that James Lithgow ultimately came to regard his time at the front as a waste of his talent; after the battle of the Somme he wrote in November 1916:<blockquote>The authorities can claim what they like for military service: three of the four juniors who came out with us are now considered fit to do my job here and the supply of such fellows is ample. I am therefore forced to the conclusion that I would be more useful helping you in our own business than messing about out here.</blockquote>However, James Lithgow's desire to return to his shipbuilding business and employ his talents more effectively in aid of the war effort were not to be quickly answered. Not until May 1917, when Sir Eric Campbell Geddes was appointed controller of merchant shipbuilding, was James Lithgow finally recalled from the front to take up a new position of director of merchant shipbuilding with the responsibility of ensuring that the merchant yards met the country's needs for new tonnage. Quite suddenly he was enmeshed in a network of influence, forming working relationships with men who were to be useful contacts in his later career, notably through his work with Lord Pirrie, controller of Harland and Woolf, and Lord Weir of Eastwood.<br>
<br>James Lithgow was able to return to Port Glasgow to join his brother early in 1919, and at this time the name of the business was at last changed from Russell &amp; Co. to Lithgows Ltd and the brothers changed the partnership to a private limited company. This was a prelude to much expansion and merger activity, encouraged by the buoyancy of demand for new tonnage at the end of the war. The Lithgows widened their own control of the local industry, acquiring another two yards in 1919, those of Dunlop Bremner &amp; Co. and William Hamilton &amp; Co. The Clydeside industry was then also reshaping itself in order to secure its supplies of steel, and the Lithgows integrated into coal, iron, and steel with the acquisition of James Dunlop &amp; Co. Consequently, by 1920 the two brothers presided over a much enlarged business empire, which was vertically integrated with interests in coal, iron and steel making, marine engineering, and shipbuilding, and in shipowning and ship operation.<br>
<br>With both brothers now at home in Port Glasgow, the pattern of management reshaped itself, with James based in his office in the old William Hamilton's yard and Henry in the East Yard, purchased from Duncan &amp; Co., while the Kingston site was the base for their manager, John Muirhead. The three worked closely together and on this foundation the Lithgow yards sustained a high level of activity during the difficult years of the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1920 and 1939 the Lithgow group launched 1.017 million tons of merchant ships, making them the third yard by rank in Britain behind Swan Hunter and Harland and Woolf. During this period they launched nearly twice as much tonnage as the next ranked Clyde yard of Barclay Curle &amp; Co.<br>
<br>In the period following the First World War Henry Lithgow and John Muirhead were closely concerned with the day-to-day management of the yards while James Lithgow was soon sucked into public affairs. In 1920 James Lithgow became president of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation; this re-established his wartime contacts with Lord Weir of Eastwood who was then president of the National Confederation of Employers' Organisations, and James Lithgow became vice-president of that body in 1922, representing the employers at the International Labour Organization in Geneva between 1922 and 1927. There he met Horace Wilson, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Labour, who was to become industrial adviser to the government and ultimately head of the civil service.<br>
<br>Even as his public career was opening up, James Lithgow began to enjoy a different style of life: in 1924, at the age of forty-one, he married Gwendolyn Amy Harrison, daughter of John Robinson Harrison, a former Clyde shipowner. The couple had a son and two daughters. He then also built his own home, Gleddoch House at Langbank, finally moving out of Drums, leaving his brother Henry to live at home with his mother. Henry then purchased another house of his own at Ormsary where he could entertain his own guests. Like James he was passionately fond of country pursuits, and at the same time he purchased a grouse moor at Duchal in the Renfrewshire hills behind the shipyards, where he built a 7 mile long light railway to carry him and his guests on the shoots. Henry Lithgow remained unmarried. This busy period also saw the Lithgows again extend their industrial empire by acquiring the engine works of Rankine and Blackmore in 1923. James Lithgow's public involvement brought him a baronetcy from Stanley Baldwin in 1923.<br>
<br>The Lithgow brothers had very strong views on the post-war condition of British industry, and James was their joint spokesman. They both believed that competitiveness could only be regained through reducing costs, and by organized labour delivering a fair day's work for fair wages. They were openly critical of the attitude of organized labour to wages and to manning arrangements, and believed that labour was obstructive to their efforts to introduce labour-saving machinery which could have improved productivity. They also feared that the excessive wartime expansion of capacity, costs, and wages would have to be paid for, and this was borne out in the difficulties of the later 1920s and early 1930s. Both James and Henry Lithgow were ultimately to be converted to the view that a fundamental readjustment of industry was required which involved the rationalization of capacity, bringing with it a loss of jobs and the closure of redundant capacity.<br>
<br>Sir James Lithgow took a leading role in preparing the shipbuilding industry for this experience, being the main spokesman in designing the industry rationalization scheme. At this point his friendship with Andrew Duncan made it possible for him to bring his proposal to the attention of Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, who was committed to the concept of rationalization, as well as seeing it as a measure to untangle the morass of debt which bore down on the banks and heavy industry by the end of the 1920s. The Bank of England agreed to underwrite the shipbuilding industry's scheme, which created the rationalization company National Shipbuilders' Security Ltd (NSS) in November 1930. Lithgow was not only the major industry spokesman for this purpose but became chairman of NSS in 1930 and at the same time president of the Federation of British Industry. In the same year he showed his commitment to industrial regeneration by becoming chairman of the Scottish National Development Council executive committee.<br>
<br>Under Lithgow's guidance NSS successfully purchased and closed about one-third of shipbuilding industry capacity between 1930 and 1939. James Lithgow defended this action and the loss of jobs as necessary to put the industry on a firm and competitive footing which would allow it to re-employ men as business regained momentum. He also believed it was necessary for industries to put their own house in order so that the government would not be drawn in. The first great casualty of NSS was the huge Beardmore Yard at Dalmuir on the Clyde, in which the Bank of England held considerable debt. Lithgow's role in relieving the Bank of England of this responsibility was not unconnected with the terms on which, in 1934, the Lithgow brothers were able to purchase Beardmore debentures from the Bank of England in order to take control of that great iron and steel company.<br>
<br>The steel industry was also subject to rationalization at this time and the Lithgow ownership of James Dunlop &amp; Co. involved them in the rationalization of Scottish steelmaking capacity. The main player here was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32610/', "John Craig")</script> of the Colville group; in discussion with Craig the Lithgows agreed to merge their Dunlop holdings with the Colvilles in 1931, as a consequence of which both brothers joined the board of the Colville companies. Later in 1934 the Bank of England accepted the advice of their steel rationalizer J. Bruce Gardner to help the Lithgow brothers buy the shares of the Steel Company of Scotland. Their ownership of these shares posed a threat to the growing monopoly of the Colville group in supplying the shipbuilding market, and encouraged the Colville group also to incorporate the Steel Company of Scotland in its rationalization scheme. When the Colvilles purchased the Steel Company of Scotland from the Lithgows in 1936 they paid &pound;951,750, while the Lithgows had purchased the company for &pound;672,975; the profit, however, was donated by the two brothers to the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Henry and James Lithgow consequently played a significant role in the creation of the new Scottish steel industry in the 1930s, as well as securing their own interests in shipbuilding. Their involvement with Montagu Norman and Andrew Duncan again placed them in the position to acquire the shares of the troubled Fairfield yard after it was involved in the insolvency of the Anchor Line. Norman and Duncan made it possible for the Lithgows to acquire Fairfields and bring that great but ailing yard within the Lithgow group in 1935.<br>
<br>The Lithgows led by James Lithgow emerged as leading players in Scottish industrial politics and policy in the 1930s. While James took the public role, he was enabled to do so because Henry took the brunt of the responsibility of the day-to-day industrial management of their expanding business empire. James Lithgow also emerged as the leading spokesman for new industrial development in Scotland and he was much involved with the Scottish Economic Committee and its labours to attract new lighter industry to the economy in these years. Henry supported James's efforts in this regard because both brothers shared a highly moral philosophy on business responsibility. They believed that &#145;those who had made their money in Scotland have an obligation to keep it there and to use their best endeavours to develop and keep the health of the industry to which they owe their own prosperity&#146;.<br>
<br>This same commitment to their industry and their country set the pattern for their roles in the Second World War. Sir James was almost automatically called to London by Winston Churchill in 1940 to become controller of merchant shipbuilding and repairs. He also became one of the lords of the Admiralty, was briefly controller of tanks, and also acted as deputy chairman of the industrial capacity committee of the production council, working there with Harold MacMillan as chairman. He was also president of the Iron and Steel Federation between 1943 and 1945, while retaining his chairmanship of both Beardmores and Fairfields. The public pressure on James Lithgow was obvious and intense, but the private pressure on his brother Henry was unremitting. Henry now lived alone at Drums after his mother's death, and his sole family life came from his attachment to his brother's family. He carried most of the burden of wartime management of the Lithgow yards, and he was usually there in the yards seven days each week unless James was home from London and they could snatch a little shared leisure together.<br>
<br>At the end of the war James returned eagerly to Port Glasgow to rejoin his brother and his family, but neither brother was long to survive the wartime pressures. Henry had never been robust and his health deteriorated abruptly in 1947; he died at home at Drums on 28 May 1948. Except for wartime duty the two brothers had never lived more than a few miles apart and had always depended heavily on each other. Henry's death faced the Lithgows with death duties of &pound;2 million, which Sir James paid within a week of receiving the statement. Henry's death was a bitter blow to James, for the demands for new tonnage were unceasing and the post-war scarcities made it difficult for yards to meet all the demands made upon them. James, however, was not to have the opportunity to cope effectively with the post-war condition of the industry, for four months after his brother's death he suffered a serious thrombosis while shooting on his estate at Ormsary. He fought the consequences of his stroke for three years but never fully recovered, dying on 23 February 1952 at Gleddoch House, Langbank. He was buried at Ormsary, Argyll. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>With the death of the two brothers, Sir James's son William inherited the baronetcy and also the largest private shipbuilding concern in the world. The two brothers had been given early control of a substantial shipbuilding and shipping business when their father died, and during the next forty years extended this business into Scotland's leading industrial dynasty. They did so through re-investing heavily in their own operations and through long hours of hard work in the yards and in public service, sustained throughout by a strong sense of duty and a desire to give back to others what life had delivered to them. They were both staunch supporters of the Church of Scotland, which benefited greatly from their donations. They were also continuous benefactors of their industrial community and especially of the town of Port Glasgow, which honoured Sir James in 1951 by creating him the first honorary citizen of the burgh. The driving force behind the Lithgows was a desire to serve and give value for money. Henry made his contribution in the yards and on the boards of the companies in the Lithgow group, while James extended his service to the industry and to the country at large, emerging as an industrial statesman of rare quality.<br>
<br>Between 1874 and 1952 the Lithgow family created an industrial empire unrivalled in Scotland's economic history. Little of consequence was achieved in Scotland's industrial economy between the 1920s and the 1940s that did not in significant measure owe something to the contribution, the drive, the energy, and the leadership of the Lithgows of Port Glasgow.<br>
