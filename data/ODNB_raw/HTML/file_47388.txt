<span class="headword">Grand,  Lawrence Douglas</span>  (1898&#150;1975), <span class="occ">soldier and intelligence officer</span>, was born on 10 August 1898 at 7 Rose Lane, Wavertree, Liverpool, the elder son of Douglas Henry Grand of Beckenham, a commission merchant, and his wife, Emma Gertrude Chamberlain. He left the sixth form at Rugby School in mid-1916 for a year at Woolwich, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 28 September 1917. He saw no active service in the First World War, as he went on to the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, but saw plenty soon after it. He served briefly in north Russia in 1919, in 384 field company; on the north-west frontier of India and in the Iraq revolt in 1920; and with the Iraq levies in Kurdistan in 1923. For his work in this last campaign he was appointed MBE.<br>
<br>Grand matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in October 1923, but never went into residence and took no degree. After five years' routine soldiering in England he was promoted captain on 28 September 1928; he became major on the same date in 1937. He married on 6 November 1930 Irene Lola Hilda (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), daughter of Charles Theobald Mathew, a captain in the Indian army. They had a son, and a daughter who married the heir of the tenth earl of Bessborough.<br>
<br>In April 1938 Grand was seconded to the Secret Intelligence Service to start up a new section, at first called IX, later known as D. His task was &#145;to investigate every possibility of attacking potential enemies by means other than the operations of military force&#146;  (Foot, 2), yet he was at first forbidden to instigate any overt action. &#145;Examining such an enormous task&#146;, he wrote in 1946, &#145;one felt as if one had been told to move the Pyramids with a pin&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Grand had a country headquarters at The Frythe, near Welwyn, and set up an office in 2 Caxton Street, Westminster, where he accumulated friends, mostly from the City of London. One of them has testified to his fertility of ideas and powers of leadership  (Sweet-Escott, 20), but results were meagre. He was tall, good-looking, elegantly dressed, with a heavy dark moustache, and exuded an air of mystery and command at once. He sent an agent out to reconnoitre the middle Danube, aiming at blocking the flow of Romanian oil to Germany, and had a few leaflets prepared by &eacute;migr&eacute;s aimed at seducing German voters from allegiance to the Nazis. Attempts to interfere with the supply of Swedish iron to Germany misfired. For some months J. C. F. Holland, who was preparing comparable tasks for the War Office, worked alongside him in Caxton Street, but while Holland thought Grand rash, Grand thought Holland over careful. Holland went back to the War Office when the Second World War began.<br>
<br>Grand took over three upper floors of the St Ermin's Hotel next door, and expanded his section, but combining haste with secrecy led too often to muddle. D section's attempts in midsummer 1940 to arrange stay-behind parties, to disrupt the communications of a German invasion that was expected shortly, caused such confusion that the whole project was handed over to Holland. Grand had seventy-three officers under him by July (and claimed 140). His section, Holland's section, and a propaganda branch of the Foreign Office were all then absorbed into the new Special Operations Executive. He was not: he and his new master, Hugh Dalton, fell out irretrievably. Dalton thought him disloyal, dishonest even, and shed him back to the army in September, on condition that he was at once posted abroad.<br>
<br>Grand went to India and resumed more professional engineering. In 1943, advanced to CBE, he became director of engineer resources at general headquarters in India. Not even Indian heat could dim his energies and he was created CIE in 1946. He returned home to become chief engineer, home counties district, in 1946&#150;9. In 1949 he was promoted major-general and held his last army post, as director of fortifications and works in the War Office; he retired as a CB in 1952. In 1951 he joined the Institution of Civil Engineers. He worked in the 1960s with Epar (Engineer Planning and Resources) Limited, an engineering firm at 50 Pall Mall, and was involved with the construction of large hotels in the Levant. When posted to the War Office, he moved his home from Trebetherick on Padstow Bay in Cornwall to Delaford Manor, Iver, Buckinghamshire, where he lived until his death, from a motorway accident. He was declared dead on arrival at Putney Hospital, London, on 22 November 1975.<br>
