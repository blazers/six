<span class="headword">Thwaites, Sir  John</span>  (1815&#150;1870), <span class="occ">public servant</span>, was born on 24 May 1815 at Maulds Meaburn, Westmorland, the third son of Christopher Thwaites (1785&#150;1864), yeoman farmer of Toddy Gill Hall, Warcop, and his wife, Hannah Smith (1789&#150;1841). Educated at Reagill School, Thwaites moved to London in 1832 and found employment at Henry Bardwell's woollen draper's on Holborn Hill. He became a partner in the business shortly after his marriage, on 15 September 1835 at Holy Trinity, Cloudesley Square, Islington, to Harriott (1814/15&#150;1860), the daughter of William Bardwell of Uggleshall, Suffolk. In 1842 Thwaites set up his own woollen drapery in Southwark, initially at 18 Blackman Street, and later at 61&#150;2 Borough High Street.<br>
<br>Thwaites was a Strict and Particular Baptist, preaching at the Surrey Tabernacle where he was deacon for sixteen years. He also undertook parochial duties at St Mary's, Newington Butts; St Paul's, Deptford; and St Saviour. These offered him scope for involvement in public affairs as overseer, guardian of the poor, churchwarden, and chairman of the board of guardians. He sought wider responsibilities by participating in the early closing movement, campaigning for Apsley Pellatt (the Liberal MP for Southwark), and representing Southwark on the metropolitan commission of sewers. He also helped (in 1849) to set up the Surrey Gas Consumers' Company, which aimed to secure cheaper gas by breaking local monopolies.<br>
<br>When the Metropolitan Board of Works was established in 1855 Thwaites was elected to represent both St Saviour's and Greenwich. He wrote <span class="italic">A Sketch on the History and Prospects of the Metropolitan Drainage Question</span> in the same year, and was elected chairman of the board. His salary of &pound;1500 allowed him to work full time. Between 1855 and 1870 the board carried through the main drainage schemes for London (for which he was knighted on 18 May 1865) and the construction of the Thames Embankment which opened on 13 July 1870. In 1861 he was appointed a member of the royal commission on plans for embanking the Thames and he gave evidence to various select committees about London's gas supply, local government and taxation, and sewage. His concern that the gas monopoly worked against the consumers' interest elicited a <span class="italic">Letter from Sir John Thwaites to Sir Stafford Northcote as to the proposals of the board for the future control of the gas companies of the metropolis</span> (1867) suggesting the board should buy out the gas companies. He was a member of the royal commission on water supply which reported in 1869.<br>
<br>Thwaites's first wife died in 1860, and on 13 August 1861 he married Eliza Carrington, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodruffe (1815/16&#150;1883), the widow of Benjamin Carrington (<i>d</i>. 1851), resident medical officer of the Holloway and North Islington Dispensary. Thwaites was a magistrate for Surrey and both magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Middlesex. Ill through overwork, he succumbed to diabetes and English cholera on 8 August 1870 at his home, Meaburn House, Upper Richmond Road, Wandsworth. He was buried five days later near his first wife at Nunhead cemetery, Linden Grove. His second wife, three sons, and a daughter survived him. A self-made man, impassive in manner, Liberal in politics, and dissenting in religion, he had achieved a position of much influence across greater London.<br>
