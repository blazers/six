<span class="headword">Beck,  Henry Charles <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1974), <span class="occ">graphic artist and map designer</span>, was born on 4 June 1902 at 14 Wesley Road, Leyton, Essex, the second child and only son of Joshua Try Beck, variously described as a commercial traveller, and an artist and monumental mason, and Eleanor Louisa Crouch. He had an elder sister, Winifred, and two younger sisters, Dorothy and Millicent. The Becks were a close-knit family. They moved to Highgate village, Middlesex, about 1910 and Harry was educated at Grove House School, a boys' private school in Highgate. After having left school he was sent to Italy to study marble, presumably with a view to his following in his father's footsteps as a monumental mason. He also went to art classes in Highgate. There he met Nora (1906/7&#150;1993), daughter of Bryan Millington, of independent means, and they married on 16 September 1933 at St Michael and All Angels' parish church, Mill Hill, Middlesex. They had no children.<br>
<br>Beck found it difficult to find work as a graphic artist but in 1925 was taken on as a temporary junior draughtsman with London Underground in the signal engineers' office. He was made redundant twice during the next five years and remained a temporary staff member until 1937; but he maintained contact with London Underground in and out of employment and began to develop his ideas for what became the definitive map of the underground. London Underground showed no interest in his map when Beck first showed it to the management in 1931 but he continued to develop it and the following year the management agreed to give it a trial. The public, who were asked for their views, responded favourably.<br>
<br>Various maps of the underground railways had already been printed but all were unsatisfactory. Most tried to preserve both angle and area and thus were difficult to follow, particularly in the central area where the rail lines were densest. It was in just this area where most passengers travelled and therefore where the need for clear information was greatest. Most maps also showed the rail lines in relation to surface features, notably roads. Beck's map was topologically correct but topographically distorted&#151;that is, neither angle nor area was preserved but the stations and interchanges stood in correct relation one to another. This enabled Beck to show on one map central areas at far larger scales than peripheral ones, and to route his lines both to give an aesthetically pleasing result and to allow all station names to be legibly displayed. The aesthetic unity of the map was enhanced by his use only of vertical and horizontal lines and those at 45&deg;. Beck's map, or diagram as it is sometimes called, quickly established itself as the definitive map.<br>
<br>Beck continued to maintain, update, and improve his map in his own time, responding also to demands from the underground railways management for alterations, of many of which he rightly disapproved. In November 1937 he agreed to transfer copyright of the design to the management of the railways. He claimed that at the time a gentleman's understanding was reached that all alterations were to be made or edited by Beck himself, Beck to be paid a fee and to be considered a freelance artist for this work. The first alleged violation of this agreement came in 1938 when Zero (Hans Schleger) designed a variant which was printed and circulated. Beck protested, and subsequent changes were made by him as he claimed the agreement stipulated. Further dispute occurred in 1946, and in 1960 the agreement broke down when London Underground published an amateurish variant of his map designed by Harold F. Hutchinson. A bitter correspondence ensued between Beck and the railways management but it was clear that London Transport did not want to use his work further. Colleagues have suggested that his obsession with the map perhaps led him to be rather intransigent over its maintenance and this was perhaps behind the decision of the management; but it seems clear that Beck was shabbily treated by the management, which ended up with markedly poorer maps at a greater cost to itself as a result of having broken off dealings with Beck.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Beck was seconded to the War Office on secret work and afterwards returned to what was then London Transport. In 1947 he resigned to become a lecturer at the London School of Printing and Kindred Trades (later the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts). When Beck retired he and his wife moved to High Barnet and later to The Eyrie, Frogham, Fordingbridge, Hampshire. He died on 18 September 1974 at the Royal South Hampshire Hospital, Southampton, having suffered from bladder cancer. He was survived by his wife, who continued to live at Frogham until her death in 1993.<br>
<br>Beck is remembered as a gentle pleasant man with a great sense of humour, though disputes over copyright left him bitter and his map was clearly an obsession with him, dominating both his professional and private life. In appearance Beck was thick set and round-shouldered, as befits a draughtsman. In his youth he was a keen swimmer and oarsman and he retained his interest in singing (he had a fine baritone voice) and in photography.<br>
<br>Beck's map has remained the basis for London's underground railway map and has shown itself extremely flexible and able to accommodate additional lines and additional information. Its success in London, which has one of the most complex underground railway systems in the world, has ensured the adoption of the topologically correct map for depicting transport systems in many other parts of the world. He was not the first to use such a map (and he probably knew the similar work of such designers as George Dow) but his use of the concept to combine so many lines and his execution of it were remarkable and enduring achievements. His reputation led to his being invited in the late 1930s to design a similar map for the Paris Metro, though the project was never completed. A gallery is named after him in London's Transport Museum.<br>
