<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Overton,  Robert</span>  (1608/9&#150;1678/9), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was the son and heir of John Overton and Joan Snawsell, daughter of Robert Snawsell of Bilton and his wife, Anne Waters. John Overton of Easington was a landed gentleman in south-east Yorkshire, where Overtons had lived for generations. During the second civil war royalists imprisoned John Overton for twenty-two weeks and seized his personal estate. Nevertheless his will, proved in 1654, indicates that he retained substantial possessions and his numerous bequests included daughter, daughter-in-law, and many grandchildren.<br>
<br>Robert Overton matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1627 and was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1631. In June 1632 he married Ann Gardiner (1615/16&#150;1665), daughter of Jeremy Gardiner of Stratford Bow, Middlesex. Overton's manuscript volume, &#145;Gospell observations&#146;, illuminates his enduring devotion to his wife and reveals that in 1665 four daughters and three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65920/', "Benjamin Overton")</script>, were living. Ann Overton was a strong woman, deeply religious, ambitious, and protective. In a 1647 letter to Lord Fairfax she asked that Robert be advanced to colonel. On her deathbed, eighteen years later, she expressed contentment that Robert, &#145;soe tender a spirit&#146;, could not witness her suffering  (Princeton University Library, MS C O 199, Overton MS, 87).<h2>
<a name="CivilwarandgovernorofHull"></a>Civil war and governor of Hull</h2>In the first civil war Overton served with the northern army under Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, and his son, Sir Thomas. Both Fairfaxes thought well of Overton, whose courage and skill were demonstrated during the 1643 defence of Hull where he acquitted himself &#145;with much honour and gallantry&#146;  (E. Ludlow, <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, ed. C. H. Firth, 2 vols., 1894, 1.65). John Milton adds that at Marston Moor, on 2 July 1644, leaders of the left wing, &#145;looking behind them in flight, beheld you making a stand &hellip; repelling the attacks of the enemy amid dense slaughter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Prose Works</span>, 4, pt 1, 676). In August 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax was appointed governor of Pontefract and named Overton his deputy. Within weeks of assuming his post Overton conquered Sandal Castle. In the summer of 1647 Fairfax secured Overton a commission as colonel of foot in the New Model Army, and during the political debates of the army's general council Overton was appointed to committees at Reading and Putney. By March 1648 he was in Hull as Fairfax's deputy governor. Prominent townsmen and officials who were close to his predecessor considered Overton a radical and asked that he be replaced. No specific charges were cited, and he held the post intermittently until 1660. During the second war Overton remained with the garrison in Hull. One of his royalist prisoners in 1648&#150;9 recalled him as &#145;a great Independent &hellip; ane enemie to monarchie, whatever name it had &hellip; a schollar, bot a little pedantic&#146;, who treated his prisoners with notable &#145;civilitie&#146;  (J. Turner, <span class="italic">Memoirs of his Own Life and Times</span>, 1829, 16.78&#150;9).<br>
<br>Before the defeat of the king Overton made only one known comment about his revolutionary objective. On 11 February 1648, in a letter to Fairfax's secretary, Overton expresses pleasure that the king's servants have been removed and suggests that &#145;it would prove a happy privation if the Father would please to dispossess him of three transitory kingdoms to infeoff him in an eternal one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials of the Civil War</span>, 2.10&#150;11). There is no reason to infer that the comment was a covert plea for regicide. Neither is there any indication that Overton opposed the execution of the king eleven months later, when he remained in Hull instead of serving as a commissioner at the trial, apparently believing that it was more important to be with his garrison at a critical time.<br>
<br>Overton was apprehensive about the impending settlement of the state. Three weeks before the king's execution he addressed a letter to Fairfax that accompanied an eloquent <span class="italic">Declaration</span> from the officers of the garrison. Letter and <span class="italic">Declaration</span> are distinguished by the compelling style and vivid metaphors that are found throughout Overton's writings. After a preliminary address to Fairfax that recalls the council of officers' November <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>&#151;&#145;with every tittle whereof we totally comply&#146;&#151;the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> reviews grievances, notes the promises of the previous six years, and condemns the &#145;corrupted party&#146; in the Commons  (<span class="italic">The Declaration of the Officers of the Garrison of Hull</span>, 1 March 1649, 4, 15); Overton's letter is dated 9 January. The final six pages delineate a settlement similar to proposals in the <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>: a speedy end to the present parliament; a succession of free biennial parliaments with an equitable distribution of seats; future kings elected by the people's representatives and having no negative voice; a &#145;universal and mutual Agreement, &hellip; enacted and decreed, <i>in perpetuum</i>&#146;, that asserts that the power of parliament is &#145;inferior only to that of the people&#146;  (ibid., 16). Overton's letter reflects his belief that there is little likelihood that the &#145;corrupt Commons&#146; will effect these reforms. He asks that, &#145;in this last act of our Age&#146;, Fairfax lead the army, resolved &#145;rather to perish with your honest officers and souldiers, then otherwise to enjoy the Genius of a temporall happinesse&#146;. It is Overton's only known proposal for violent action to accomplish &#145;remonstrated principle&#146;  (ibid., 2&#150;3).<br>
<br>Five months later, in a letter appended to his regiment's <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span> denying any association with Leveller uprisings, Overton deplores &#145;divisions and distractions&#146; that would have &#145;destroyed us&#146; but for the goodness of God. Overton pledges obedience to parliament and the army, &#145;yet ever with such due Reservations as tended to the keeping sacred and inviolable my particular and private Trust, which &hellip; I purpose never to part withall&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Humble Remonstrance &hellip; of Col. Overton's Regiment &hellip; with Colonel Overton's Letter to the General</span>, 5 June 1649, 6, 7).<h2>
<a name="Scotlandandimprisonment"></a>Scotland and imprisonment</h2>In the summer of 1650 Overton joined Cromwell's campaign in Scotland. He led his brigade in the battle at Dunbar on 3 September, and after the occupation of Edinburgh Cromwell departed, leaving Overton as governor. In July 1651 Overton led his troops across the Firth of Forth and when Perth surrendered he became governor there. He was with Lieutenant-General Monck when Dundee surrendered and in November was governor of Aberdeen. In February 1652, after marching north, Overton established a garrison in the Orkneys before returning to Fife as sheriff. By June he was in the west, and in December he was advanced to major-general and commander of all the forces in western Scotland. Overton evinced military and administrative skills throughout his thirty months in Scotland where &#145;Scots of the West and North&#146; described him as &#145;a most humane foe, &hellip; a merciful conqueror&#146;  (Milton, <span class="italic">Complete Prose Works</span>, 4, pt, 1, 676).<br>
<br>When Overton returned to Yorkshire in February 1653 he possessed considerable property. He had recently succeeded to his father's Easington estate; in 1652 parliament had voted him &pound;400 p.a. in Scottish lands; in 1651 he had paid over &pound;7000 for the confiscated crown fee farm rent of the manor of Holderness. He resumed his post as governor of Hull, and when Cromwell forcibly dismissed the Rump Parliament, Overton and the garrison responded with a pamphlet consisting of two letters to Cromwell that were devoid of the apocalyptic prophecies that marked many addresses of the time. The second letter offered &#145;free and hearty Concurrence&#146; with the dissolution, rejected any &#145;meddling with State matters&#146;, and urged Cromwell to employ &#145;religion, reason, and resolution&#146; in settling the state  (<span class="italic">More Hearts and Hands Appearing for the Work</span>, 7 June 1653, 3, 5, 6).<br>
<br>The collapse of Barebone's Parliament in December was followed by the establishment of the protectorate. Again Overton was apprehensive. Cromwell had approved of Overton during the first civil war and in Scotland, and in the spring of 1654 Overton met him before returning to Scotland. Overton assured the protector that he would serve him loyally unless &#145;I perceived his lordship did only design the setting up of himself, and not the good of these nations&#146;. Should the latter occur, Overton promised Cromwell that &#145;I could not set one foot before another to serve him&#146;. Cromwell replied: &#145;Thou wert a knave, if thou wouldst&#146;  (Thurloe, 3.110). Overton repeated his pledge to Monck when he arrived in Scotland.<br>
<br>In December officers in Overton's Aberdeen headquarters sent letters announcing a meeting in Edinburgh to consider whether the army had been faithful to its duty &#145;to assert the freedomes of the people in the priviledges of parliament&#146;  (Thurloe, 3.29&#150;30). Overton's involvement in the plan was not clear, but, in addition to the doubts he had admitted to Cromwell, before leaving London Overton had met with John Wildman who was conspiring with dissident colonels to attack the foundations of the protectorate. More immediately, Overton had not informed Monck of political dissension among his officers. He was sent to London and committed to the Tower. No hard evidence of his participation in any conspiracy was ever advanced, but he was held for more than four years without trial, charge, or, after his transfer to Jersey, right of habeas corpus. It is not unlikely that respect for Overton's ability and fear of his appeal as an opposition leader played a major role in his imprisonment.<h2>
<a name="Thefalloftherepublic"></a>The fall of the republic</h2>In February 1659 Commonwealthsmen in Richard Cromwell's parliament responded to a petition from Overton's sister by demanding his appearance for a hearing. On 16 March Overton addressed the house, asserting that he hoped that he had &#145;not done anything contrary to what I at first engaged, and fought for&#146;. He was released the same day  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.150&#150;61). Seven weeks later the protectorate fell, and in June the re-empowered Rump restored all Overton's commands and named a committee to review indemnity.<br>
<br>Overton supported the returned republic as the best available expedient, but as the Rump's weaknesses became increasingly apparent he again envisioned government by godly men. His name is among the twenty signatures to <span class="italic">An Essay toward Settlement</span>, a broadsheet petition published by 19 September 1659. The petition includes demands for liberty of conscience and no state church, reform of the ministry and the law in accordance with scripture, and government by &#145;men of courage, fearing God, and hating Covetousness&#146;. Although twelve signers, including Overton, have been termed Fifth Monarchy Men  (B. Capp, <span class="italic">The Fifth Monarchy Men</span>, 1972, 126), the appeal does not include millenarian predictions and reflects the aspirations of the many revolutionaries who believed in the efficacy of rule by godly men. In October Overton and his officers refused to support an address to parliament in which the council of officers demanded that, except for disbandment, no officer or soldier be dismissed except by court martial. The house cashiered the nine officers who promoted the address and named Overton one of the seven commissioners in charge of the army. The next day troops of the cashiered officers closed the house and took over the government.<br>
<br>Monck, who also had rejected the cashiered officers' address, responded to the lock-out by declaring for parliament and preparing to march south. He asked Overton and other commanders for support, and although no direct reply from Overton to Monck has been found, in early November Overton published an impassioned appeal for a peaceful settlement in accordance with God's purpose. <span class="italic">The Humble and Healing Advice &hellip; to Charles Lord Fleetwood and General Monck</span> contends that the Lord has been forced to &#145;overturn and overturn&#146; governments because none has conformed with &#145;what we professe&#146;. Fleetwood and Monck are urged to come together; &#145;otherwise &hellip; another overturne will suddenly overtake you&#146;. Should this occur, Overton will endeavour to secure the peace of Hull and support the settlement that has the most &#145;superscription of Christ upon it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Humble and Healing Advice</span>, n.d., 2, 6).<br>
<br>On 1 January 1660, six days after the Rump returned, Monck's forces crossed the Tweed, and within a fortnight Monck and Overton agreed that they stood together against those who would &#145;bring in the Common Enimie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 4.244&#150;7). Monck's readmission of the excluded members of the house on 21 February assured the return of the &#145;Enimie&#146;. Reports soon reached Monck about Overton's dissemination among Yorkshire troops of an incendiary letter expressing hope that soldiers would concur in defence of the &#145;Good Old Cause against &hellip; a King and Single Person&#146;  (Baker, 753). Monck named a new governor of Hull and ordered Overton to London. Overton recognized defeat and reached London on 18 March.<br>
<br>Overton was not excluded from the restored monarch's act of pardon, but more than half of his remaining years were passed in prison. In December 1660 he was among those seized to forestall a &#145;damnable Plot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Publicus</span>, 13&#150;20 Dec 1660, 810&#150;11) which, if it existed, was never disclosed. Overton was moved from the Tower to Chepstow in November 1661 and at some point thereafter he gained his freedom, for in May 1663 he was again arrested on suspicion of seditious practices; as before he was not tried, and in January 1664 he was again sent to Jersey. He was confined on the island until his release to his brother-in-law, Thomas Gardiner, in December 1671.<h2>
<a name="Politicalandreligiousconvictions"></a>Political and religious convictions</h2>Overton spent the last years of his life with his daughter, Anne Broughton, and her husband in Seaton, Rutland. The will that Overton signed on 23 June 1678, which was proved on 29 January 1679, states that he had been well attended during &#145;my long sickness&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB/11/359, sig. 8). He was buried in New Church Yard, Moorfields in London. His apostate son and heir, John, who succeeded to the Easington property, is not mentioned in the will, and except for books, manuscripts, and other effects, Overton's personal estate was divided between two other sons. No figures are given, but if he retained the property he had in 1653, he left a substantial estate.<br>
<br>The manuscripts that Overton bequeathed to two daughters included a 360-page volume, &#145;Gospell observations &amp; religious manifestations, &amp;c&#146;, that is primarily prose and poetic tributes to his wife, who died in 1665. The first section of the manuscript, except for the last entry, consists of prose maxims that may have been written before Ann Overton's death. Among them are segments that clarify Overton's political convictions and religious tolerance. A deeply religious Independent, Overton believed that no profession of piety should be despised. He questions &#145;incongruetyes &amp; contradictions&#146; of the Fifth Monarchy Men but finds their essential creed &#145;comfortable&#146;, as he approves aspects of the papists, protestants, puritans, and Quakers  (Princeton University Library, MS C O 199, Overton MS, 42). The political segment highlights Overton's persistent realism. However disappointed with successive revolutionary governments, he served them as existent obstacles to monarchy. In custody after the king's Restoration, he advised potential rebels to submit to any expedient power. There is no evidence that he had abandoned his vision; he may have concluded that a moral state governed by godly men is the province of the Lord.<br>
<br>Throughout the interregnum Overton's commitment to his &#145;particular and private Trust&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Declaration of the Officers of the Garrison of Hull</span>, Overton's letter, 1649) diminished the intensity of his support for existing polities, which aroused concern among authorities aware of his abilities and always fearful of effective opposition. Royalists approached Overton, Levellers claimed him, and after 1660 he was imprisoned amid rumours of anti-monarchical plots. In fact, while Overton sympathized with Leveller views of justice, he was a political individualist, true to his vision of an ideal state. No hard evidence involved him in the plans of any radical activists. A proficient soldier and administrator, Overton was also a learned man who inspired respect and affection. For many years he was close to Milton, linked &#145;with a more than fraternal harmony, by reason of the likeness of our tastes and the sweetness of your disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Prose Works</span>, 4, pt 1, 676). Overton's gentle spirit and enduring faith protected him from bitterness as he retained confidence in the belief he professed when first imprisoned. Quoting St Peter, &#145;&#147;There are given to us exceeding great and pretious promises&#148;&#146;, Overton concludes: &#145;If in patience we possess our spirits, we shall inherit the promises&#146;  (Thurloe, 3.112).<br>
