<span class="headword">Campbell, Sir  James Macnabb</span>  (1846&#150;1903), <span class="occ">administrator in India and ethnologist</span>, born at Partick, Lanarkshire, on 4 October 1846, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4527/', "John McLeod Campbell (1800&#150;1872)")</script>, Church of Scotland minister and theologian, and his wife, Mary Campbell. His brother Donald (<i>d</i>. 1909) was rector of Oakford, Devon, and rural dean of Tiverton. Two other brothers lived with him in Bombay, John McLeod (<i>d</i>. 1888) being a member of the Bombay civil service, and Robert Story a merchant.<br>
<br>Campbell was educated at Glasgow, first at the academy and then at the university, graduating MA in 1866, with the highest honours in logic, philosophy, and English literature. Having passed the Indian Civil Service examination in 1867, he went to Bombay presidency in November 1869, and served as an assistant collector. Soon reputed for his interest in the history and customs of the people, he was in June 1873 entrusted with the compilation of the provincial <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> of Bombay, though simultaneously having other duties. From April to August 1877 he was on famine work in the Kaladgi district; and from April 1880 until late 1881 he was successively municipal commissioner of Bombay, under-secretary to government in the political, judicial, and educational departments, and collector of Bombay. Yet to the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> he devoted every spare moment. By August 1884 the statistical accounts alone occupied twenty-seven volumes averaging 500 pages each. The government, while then terminating Campbell's formal appointment as compiler, eulogized his work as &#145;a record as complete perhaps as ever was produced on behalf of any government&#146;. But in 1889 and again in 1892 the secretary of state for India urged the Bombay government to extend the gazetteer series to include volumes on the history of the Bombay presidency and on the town and island of Bombay, and suggested that this work should be entrusted to Campbell. As a result, five additional volumes (in nine parts) were published between 1893 and 1901, four of them written by Campbell himself. Campbell was made CIE in January 1885, and while home on his first furlough that year was created honorary DCL of Glasgow University. Campbell completed his <span class="italic">Bombay Gazetteer</span> at the close of 1901, when it consisted of twenty-six volumes embracing thirty-four sections; he himself wrote much in those dealing with ethnology. In 1904 R. E. Enthoven, his former assistant in Bombay, added an index volume, and brought up to date some of Campbell's earlier statistics, while in 1910 S. M. Edwards added three new volumes on the history of the city and island of Bombay.<br>
<br>After serving as collector of various districts, Campbell was from November 1891 stationed at Bombay as collector of land revenue, customs, and opium. He rendered valuable service during the cow protection riots of 1893 and contributed valuable help, as a member of a confidential preliminary committee, in formulating the scheme which led to the passage of the <span class="roman">City of Bombay Improvement Act</span> 1898.<br>
<br>Campbell was recalled from furlough early in 1897 to aid in measures against the great outbreak of plague; and in June 1897 he succeeded General Sir William Gatacre as chairman of a new and independent plague committee at Bombay. The committee's compulsory measures of sanitation had provoked rioting and the murder on 22 June 1897 of two British officers on plague duty in Poona, W. C. Rand and C. E. Ayerst. The difficulties of the situation were soon multiplied by the appearance of famine in the countryside and the return to Bombay of thousands of refugees. Campbell's resourcefulness and popular repute&#151;he was nicknamed the Murani Collector-Sahib (the collector with the divinely lighted face)&#151;greatly improved the public attitude and encouraged voluntary co-operation in inspection and other work. Largely under his influence, in June 1898 the plague committee was disbanded and the administration was restored to the municipality.<br>
<br>In June 1897 Campbell was made KCIE, and on 29 April 1898 he left Bombay in broken health, resigning, on the expiry of his furlough, in April 1900. The Bombay government on 14 February 1902 republished its earlier resolution of appreciation of his work and character and ordered it to be printed after the title-page of the first volume of the gazetteer and in every issue. Residing with his brother Robert at his father's old home, Achnashie, Rosneath, Dunbartonshire, he found his main recreation in gardening. He died unmarried at Achnashie on 26 May 1903, and was buried in Rosneath churchyard beside his parents. A memorial tablet on the ruined wall of the old church, in which his father had often preached when minister of the adjoining parish of Row, pays tribute to &#145;the noble example set by him during the great plague in Bombay, which led to his premature and deeply lamented death&#146;. His friends also founded a gold medal, conferred triennially by the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, for the best original work on Indian folklore, history, or ethnology. The first medal was presented on 1 March 1909 to A. M. Stein, the explorer, for his <span class="italic">Ancient Khotan</span>. Subsequent recipients were among the most distinguished scholars in these fields.<br>
<br>Campbell collected much material on Indian history and folklore. Apart from his gazetteer, he published the history of Mandu, the former capital of the Muslim kingdom of Malwa, in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Bombay Branch, Royal Asiatic Society</span> (19, 1895&#150;7, 154&#150;201); &#145;The bharwad jang, or, shepherds' wedding&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Anthropological Society of Bombay</span> (4, 1895&#150;7, 40&#150;74); and <span class="italic">Saint Sophia in Ramazan</span> (2nd edn, 1897). One of his hobbies was the study of spirit-scaring, and some of the materials he collected on this subject were published under the title &#145;Notes on the spirit basis of belief and custom&#146;, in various issues of the <span class="italic">Indian Antiquary</span> (23&#150;30, 1894&#150;1901).<br>
<br>In compiling the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazetteer</span> Campbell displayed both unremitting energy over a period of nearly thirty years, and great tact in revising and where necessary recasting the many contributions that were made by British and Indian collaborators. The gazetteers were originally intended as sources of information for British district officials; in time they became invaluable reference sources for scholars interested in India.<br>
<br>Campbell was a contemporary of Sir Denzil Ibbetson (1847&#150;1908), Vincent Smith (1848&#150;1920), and Sir Herbert Hope Risley (1851&#150;1911), who, like him, were both administrators and scholars. Campbell was a sympathetic and generous man. In the last decade of his service he was at the centre of the intellectual life of Bombay and brought together at his hospitable table at the Byculla Club and his residence at Breach Candy men of all occupations and professions in congenial company.<br>
