<span class="headword">Bulleid,  Oliver Vaughan Snell</span>  (1882&#150;1970), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born on 19 September 1882 in Invercargill, New Zealand, the eldest in the family of two sons and a daughter of William Bulleid, a businessman from North Tawton, Devon, and his wife, Marian (daughter of Oliver Vaughan Pugh), from Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, to which she returned with her children in 1889 on the death of her husband. Bulleid was educated at Spa College, Bridge of Allan, Scotland, and at Accrington Technical School. In 1901 he began a four-year premium apprenticeship for the Great Northern Railway at their Doncaster works, under Henry Alfred Ivatt, locomotive carriage and wagon superintendent, with academic studies at Sheffield and Leeds universities. In 1908 Bulleid married Ivatt's youngest daughter, Marjorie Campbell (1888&#150;1985). They had three sons (one of whom died in 1938 at the age of fifteen) and one daughter.<br>
<br>In the same year Bulleid became assistant works manager and chief draughtsman at the French Westinghouse Company's brake and signal works in Paris, where he had his first contacts with French railway engineers. In 1910 and 1911 he was mechanical engineer for the Board of Trade at the British pavilions at the Brussels and Turin exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1911 Bulleid returned to railway service as personal assistant to H. Nigel Gresley who had just taken over from Ivatt on the Great Northern Railway. This was the beginning of a close association and collaboration lasting for twenty-six years, interrupted only by Bulleid's war service from 1915 to 1919, when he was involved mainly in the operation of military railways serving ammunition dumps near the front in France. He attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers. Shortly after his return Gresley appointed him assistant carriage and wagon superintendent, and they introduced numerous innovations including modernized train interiors; twin articulated sleeping cars; a completely articulated five-coach train set carried on only six bogies, in whose kitchen electric cooking was pioneered.<br>
<br>In 1923 Gresley became chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Eastern, the second largest group railway, formed from six individual companies, with Bulleid as his personal assistant. Bulleid's innovative outlook on design matters and study of overseas engineering practice complemented Gresley's, and they were both closely involved in the technical work of the International Railway Congress Association. Bulleid was an active participant in developing Gresley's locomotives and rolling-stock and was a pioneer in the application of welding, including its use for boilers.<br>
<br>In 1937 Bulleid succeeded Richard Maunsell, chief mechanical engineer of the Southern Railway, which had concentrated its capital expenditure on widespread electrification and relatively little on improvement of its steam-operated services. Bulleid strongly advocated the need for more modern and powerful steam locomotives and obtained authority for these. His first heavy main-line passenger and fast freight locomotive, of the 4&#150;6&#150;2 type, was built in 1941. It was of striking &#145;air-smoothed&#146; outline and embodied many innovations, including welded steel fire-box and totally enclosed internal driving mechanism housed in an oil-bath. It rapidly demonstrated its power and haulage capacity, despite teething troubles, and 140 of these and a slightly smaller variant transformed train operation over most of the steam-worked Southern lines. From 1942 a class of more powerful 0&#150;6&#150;0 freight locomotives also gave excellent results. Bulleid introduced new and more comfortable main-line and electric suburban trains, the latter including a double-deck prototype train for the crowded Kent suburban lines and a revolutionary prototype general-purpose steam locomotive carried on two steam-driven power bogies.<br>
<br>On retirement in 1949, after the formation of the nationalized British Railways system, Bulleid was invited to join Coras Iompair Eirann, the Irish state transport system, as consulting mechanical engineer and later chief mechanical engineer. He was responsible for introducing modern carriage and wagon designs embodying welded construction, workshop modernization, and, encouraged by the high cost of imported coal, diesel locomotives and railcars. He also produced a prototype steam locomotive burning indigenous peat, which embodied features of the prototype Southern locomotive. He retired again in 1958.<br>
<br>Bulleid was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1956&#150;7, of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers in 1939&#150;45, and of the Institute of Welding in 1949. He was also an honorary member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He was appointed CBE in 1949 and received an honorary DSc from Bath University (1967). He combined great innovative ability and enthusiasm with charm, humour, and kindness to his staff, many of whom were devoted to him. He was a devout Roman Catholic. Bulleid died on 25 April 1970 in Malta.<br>
