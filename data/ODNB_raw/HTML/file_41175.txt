<span class="headword">Drew <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gladstone]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1847&#150;1927), <span class="occ">private secretary and author</span>, was born at 13 Carlton House Terrace, London, on 23 November 1847, the third of the four daughters and fifth in the family of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10787/', "William Ewart Gladstone (1809&#150;1898)")</script>, prime minister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41161/', "Catherine Gladstone, n&#233;e Glynne (1812&#150;1900)")</script>. Her childhood and youth were spent between Hawarden Castle, Flintshire, the London homes necessary to her father as a rising politician, and the houses of her extended family of cousins the Lytteltons, of Hagley Hall, Worcestershire. Unlike the rigorous educational standards that Gladstone applied to his sons, his daughters' schooling was haphazard, and in later life Mary admitted that she always found it difficult to concentrate on a sustained piece of work. Music was her passion: when she was less than forty days old her father observed her &#145;great susceptibility to musical sounds&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1 Jan 1848); and she was a talented pianist, but even there the lack of rigorous teaching showed: she was heard to comment: &#145;I know Beethoven wrote it like <i>that</i>, but I like to play it like <i>this</i>&#146;  (Masterman, 13). <br>
<br>Mary Gladstone's father was the greatest influence on her life. In many ways the Gladstone household lived up to the Victorian archetypal family: everything revolved around the needs and demands of the man at its head, and the daughters especially were expected to subordinate themselves to their parents' lives. The commandment to honour one's father and mother was held particularly strongly by the Gladstones, and religious duty was allied to the profound belief that their father was a truly great man, with genuinely important work to do. The most obvious effect of Mary's relationship with her father was the long delay of her marriage, for few men could live up to her father in her estimation, and still fewer had the temerity to approach the daughter of the prime minister. (The absence of a significant family fortune also played a part.) She had several suitors, including Edward Bickersteth Ottley and Hallam Tennyson, the son of the poet laureate, and was at least twice in love, unrequitedly&#151;with Lord Lorne (later ninth duke of Argyll and Queen Victoria's son-in-law) and with the family friend (and later prime minister) A. J. Balfour. Mary witnessed the marriages of her closest friends and relatives during her twenties with a growing sense of crisis about her own identity: there were no alternatives to marriage for women of her class and she clearly felt some dismay at the prospect of remaining a child in her parents' house. Fortunately one of the causes of her dilemma provided the relief from it, as she became an important member of Gladstone's (unpaid and unacknowledged) auxiliary staff. <br>
<br>Mary's interest in politics had a fitful start: the rightness of her father and the demerits of his opponents pretty much encompassed her views well into the 1870s. But about 1876 there came a marked change, and she began recording in detail in her diary the issues of the day and the actions of the government. Mary, like her father, was galvanized by the Bulgarian atrocities, and when he came out of retirement she began to work for him as an unofficial private secretary. When he became prime minister again in 1880 she continued in her work, having special responsibility for correspondence concerning ecclesiastical patronage. Her duties included writing many routine letters to applicants for patronage, decoding cipher telegrams, and finding suitable candidates for vacant livings. She also undertook many of the duties associated with managing a political household which her mother found onerous and uninteresting: entertaining eminent visitors, colleagues, supporters, and potential allies required significant resources of time and energy which Catherine Gladstone would not spare from her husband. <br>
<br>The other consolation Mary Gladstone found in this period was the friendship of a number of eminent, older men, among them Lord Acton, John Ruskin, James Stuart, Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Stanmore, Canon Henry Scott Holland, the Revd John Illingworth, Sir George Grove, and Lord Rosebery. Some sought initially to use correspondence with Mary as a means of gaining the ear of the prime minister but they soon came to place a high value on his daughter. Acton, in particular, wrote extensively to Mary, using the correspondence as a place in which to work out his ideas. Although he sometimes intended her to pass on information and opinions to Gladstone she was more than a conduit; an intelligent, informed woman, Mary Gladstone was the sympathetic reader that Acton had always needed. After 1886 Acton's daughter Mamie (Marie) served as his confidante, and it was with some reluctance that he resumed writing to Mary in 1892 as &#145;a way of conveying some things which I cannot say right off [to Gladstone]&#146;  (Hill, 313). Her social circle was not confined to politicians, nor indeed to men. Through her sisters Agnes and Helen and her cousin Lavinia Talbot she had strong links with the academic circles in Oxford and Cambridge, while her friend Frances Graham (later Horner) introduced her to the artists' studios. Clergymen and musicians were her natural constituency; she was less at home with the Souls, for though she counted many of them among her friends (particularly Laura and Alfred Lyttelton, Arthur Balfour, Margot Asquith, and Frances Horner) she was too much her father's daughter to accept their rejection of Victorian Christian earnestness and moral strictures. <br>
<br>After so many years as the indispensable daughter at home it came as something of a shock to many of Mary's friends when, on Christmas day 1885, she became engaged to the curate of Hawarden, Harry Drew (1856&#150;1910). They were married in Westminster Abbey on 2 February 1886, at the height of a political crisis; Gladstone gave his daughter away and went straight to Windsor, where he once again accepted the prime ministership. Marriage did not separate Mary from her ageing parents, as she made her home at Hawarden, and she continued to be indispensable, but she no longer played such a prominent part in their London and political lives. In August 1886 she miscarried a son and was dangerously ill for five months. In March 1890, at the age of forty-two, she gave birth to a daughter, Dorothy. She had a further miscarriage in May 1893. <br>
<br>In 1897 Harry Drew accepted the living of Buckley, 3 miles from Hawarden, and for the first time Mary had her own home. The last illnesses and deaths of her parents, in 1898 and 1900, inevitably dominated these years but she established herself thoroughly in her role as a clergyman's wife; in 1904 Harry Drew became rector of Hawarden. She also began arranging to publish some of the letters that she had received from eminent men. First to appear was <span class="italic">Letters to M. G. and H. G.</span> (1903), which contained a selection of Ruskin's rather sickly letters to Mary and her sister Helen. More controversially Herbert Paul edited <span class="italic">Letters of Lord Acton to Mary, Daughter of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone</span> (1904). Mary had urged Acton to allow her to publish his letters but he had refused; now that he was dead the volume was hurried into print, with disastrous consequences for Acton's reputation. Although personal material had been removed from the letters enough was left to offend members of his family, and both Catholics and Anglicans found matter for concern in his freely expressed views on his own church and on the affairs of the other; a second, slightly amplified edition appeared in 1913. <span class="italic">Some Hawarden Letters</span>, edited by Lisle March-Phillipps and Bertram Christian, appeared in 1917, containing letters from Burne-Jones, Lord Stanmore, James Stuart, Henry Sidgwick, and George Wyndham, among others; <span class="italic">A Forty Years' Friendship</span> (1919), edited by S. L. Ollard, contained Henry Scott Holland's letters to Mary. In 1919 Mary Drew produced her only full-length book, a biography of her mother, <span class="italic">Catherine Gladstone</span>, a lightweight volume heavy on anecdote and inconsequential letters from the great and good. In 1924 she published <span class="italic">Acton, Gladstone and Others</span>, a collection of essays and reviews, including accounts of Gladstone's books and the foundation of St Deiniol's Library, and of Ruskin's infatuation with Rose La Touche. <br>
<br>Mary Drew was both lessened and liberated by her parents' deaths. She no longer had a direct connection with the great affairs of the nation, and her perspective on politics remained resolutely Gladstonian: she gave no support to the South African War, was repulsed by the military character of Queen Victoria's funeral, lamented the resurgence of the Eastern question in the form of the Balkan wars of 1912&#150;13, and reflected ironically on the passage of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> in 1920. The sudden and unexpected death of Harry Drew, in 1910, was a devastating blow: &#145;I don't quite know how to bear <i>anybody</i> now I can't have him&#146;, she wrote  (Masterman, 460). She travelled for a time and was restored somewhat by the marriage of her daughter to Francis Parish, in 1912, and the births of five grandchildren. She made her home at 2 The Boltons, Earls Court, London, developed arthritis, and became a zealous vegetarian. She continued to take a vigorous interest in politics, viewing the rise of the Labour Party with interest and more than a little sympathy. She spent Christmas 1926 at a family party at Hawarden, and died there on 1 January 1927, having been &#145;rather particularly lively at dinner in the evening&#146;  (ibid., 491). She was buried at Hawarden on 5 January, and a memorial service was held on the same day at St Margaret's, Westminster. An edited selection from her diary and family correspondence appeared in 1930 and remains a valuable source for Gladstone studies and for the portrait it paints of the interactions between social, political, and cultural circles in late-Victorian London.<br>
