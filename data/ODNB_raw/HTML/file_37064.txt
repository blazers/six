<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yerbury,  Francis Rowland <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1885&#150;1970), <span class="occ">architectural administrator</span>, was born on 19 November 1885 at Cricklewood, London, the youngest son of Francis William Yerbury, clerk, and his wife, Lucy Stinchcomb. His father died early, leaving his widow to bring up the family. An uncle paid for the education of Yerbury's two elder brothers, who went to good schools; Frank was not so fortunate, a circumstance which seemed to affect him throughout his life for he was rarely at ease in intellectual circles. Even among his chosen professional friends, such as architects and designers, he always regretted never having become an architect himself. In the hope that he might achieve this aim, he had accepted at the age of sixteen the post of office boy at the Architectural Association (AA) in Tufton Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>Yerbury did not in fact leave the AA until his retirement thirty-six years later, for when the secretary of the association died suddenly in 1911, Yerbury was appointed to succeed him and thus began his distinguished twin careers as a builder of a great school of architecture and an influential proponent and photographer of modern European building. Indeed, Yerbury became, for his architect friends in London, their prime source of information on and contact with the contemporary architecture and architects in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. His excellent photographs of modern European buildings were widely published and his many illustrated books about his travels abroad were avidly read by generations of students to whom contemporary European architecture was still an unknown quantity. Among his books were <span class="italic">Modern European Buildings</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Modern Dutch Buildings</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Small Modern English Houses</span> (1929). While acting as the leading publicist for new continental architecture, Yerbury made a great number of friends in architectural circles abroad which were to last throughout his life and even took him on an official mission to Sweden during the Second World War to reassure his Swedish friends about the state of British morale. That he had to travel in the bomb bay of a Mosquito aircraft only reinforced his message. In recognition of his contributions to international understanding and architectural appreciation he had been made a commander of the Swedish royal order of Vasa (1929) and became a knight of the Danish royal order of the Dannebrog (1951).<br>
<br>As its increasingly respected secretary, Yerbury helped successive presidents and principals, especially Robert Atkinson and Howard Robertson, to build the Architectural Association into a leading centre for architectural education, discussion, thought, and controversy. Under his guidance the AA school even began to challenge the inter-war supremacy of the Liverpool school of architecture, where his friend C. H. Reilly was the professor. While at the AA, Yerbury encouraged a colleague, J. K. Winser, to organize a building materials samples room, which was eventually to lead to a third career for Yerbury: out of that modest collection of samples for the benefit of the AA students grew the first building centre for the architectural profession as a whole. Vincent Vincent, a director of Bovis Ltd, a well-known firm of building contractors, first saw the possibilities in Yerbury's samples room, having recently visited the Architects' Samples Bureau in New York, a commercial information service on building materials. Together Vincent and Yerbury created the Building Centre in 1931 as a non-profit-distributing educational enterprise to assist all concerned with the building industry from materials suppliers to contractors, architects, surveyors, and clients alike. By 1937 the new centre, having moved from its first home in the Conduit Street headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects to its own premises in Store Street, had become almost a full-time preoccupation for Yerbury. Accordingly, in that year he resigned from the AA to devote himself to directing and developing the Building Centre in London, which in due course was to become a model for other cities and indeed for other countries. At the time of Yerbury's death there were nearly 100 similar centres in operation around the globe.<br>
<br>Yerbury was a convivial, gregarious man, with a flair for international friendships, a great love of travel, and a real talent as a photographer. He was also reputed to be an excellent raconteur and a pillar of his favourite Arts Club in Dover Street. As one of the earliest English discoverers of modern Danish design (he wrote a short monograph on Kaare Klint's furniture in 1929), he was a staunch supporter of the British Design and Industries Association, of which he became a vice-president. He was elected an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1928 and was made an OBE in 1952. He married on 28 August 1913 Winifred Constance (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), daughter of Henry Bendall; she survived him with a son and a daughter. Yerbury retired from active work in 1961 and died at Newbury on 7 July 1970.<br>
