<span class="headword">Brackenbury,  Georgina Agnes</span>  (1865&#150;1949), <span class="occ">portrait painter and suffrage campaigner</span>, was born at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on 1 July 1865, the fifth of nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3159/', "Charles Booth Brackenbury (1831&#150;1890)")</script>, an officer in the Royal Artillery who became director of the Artillery College, Woolwich, with the rank of major-general, and his wife, Hilda Eliza (1832&#150;1918), daughter of Archibald Campbell of Quebec, Canada. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32021/', "General Sir Henry Brackenbury (1837&#150;1914)")</script>, director-general of ordnance, was her uncle. A cousin, Henry Langton Brackenbury (1868&#150;1920), of Thorpe Hall, Louth, Lincolnshire, was Conservative MP for Louth in 1910 and from 1918 to 1920.<br>
<br>As their mother disliked domestic duties Georgina Brackenbury and her siblings were looked after by a housekeeper/governess who was a relative by marriage, Flora Shaw (later Lady Lugard). After her father died suddenly in June 1890 Georgina&#151;who was the eldest child of the family remaining in England&#151;lived with her mother and her sister Marie Venetia Caroline Brackenbury (1866&#150;1945) at 2 Campden Hill Square in Kensington. They also had a cottage, Brackenside, at Peaslake in Surrey.<br>
<br>Brackenbury's parents had artistic and literary interests and both were amateur painters. From 1888 to 1890 she studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, where she was a pupil of Hubert von Herkomer. He encouraged her to specialize in portraiture. By 1894 she was producing works such as her portrait of the antiquary Harold Lee Dillon, seventeenth Viscount Dillon (NPG). Between 1891 and 1907 she exhibited at the Royal Academy and in other London galleries. At one time she had a studio in Rossetti Mansions, Chelsea, but she chiefly worked from home. Her sister Marie was also a Slade student.<br>
<br>Brackenbury's mother was interested in women's suffrage, joining first the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and then in 1907 the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), as did Georgina and Marie. This decision changed their lives. As WSPU members, the sisters gave up painting for seven years to devote their energies to the suffrage movement; they used their studio to train women in public speaking. In February 1908 both were arrested during a WSPU demonstration, the &#145;pantechnicon raid&#146;, outside the House of Commons, charged, found guilty of &#145;using insulting behaviour and resisting police at Old Palace Yard&#146; and sentenced to six weeks in Holloway prison. Imprisonment proved no deterrent, and each sister chaired a section of the Hyde Park meeting of 21 June 1908 called &#145;Women's Sunday&#146;.<br>
<br>Georgina Brackenbury said she had &#145;smelled powder&#146; with the WSPU  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 18 June 1908, 251) and became an influential political activist. After her release from prison in 1908 she spoke at meetings all over Britain, including Scotland and Ireland, and toured Germany, where she gave speeches on women's suffrage. She also belonged to the International Women's Franchise Club in London. At a spa in Germany she met the South African writer and activist Olive Schreiner, who came to stay at 2 Campden Hill Square. In 1909 Georgina Brackenbury joined Annie Kenney, Elsie Howey, Clara Codd, Vera Wentworth, Mary Blathwayt, and Mary Phillips in the WSPU west of England campaign and in 1910 she replaced Mary Gawthorpe as WSPU organizer in Manchester. Mary Blathwayt invited Georgina and Marie to her home, Eagle House, near Batheaston, where her father, Colonel Linley Blathwayt, planted a tree in Georgina's honour in his suffragette arboretum. Another friend was Rose Lamartine Yates, organizing secretary of the WSPU's Wimbledon branch.<br>
<br>Brackenbury supported the Women's Tax Resistance League, founded in 1909 and one of the most militant of the suffrage groups, appealing particularly to middle-class women who resented taxation on their earned income when they had no right to vote. Many members also boycotted the 1911 national census; there are no entries in that year's census for Georgina, her mother, or her sister. On census evening, 2 April, the Brackenburys were reported to have held an all-night party at 2 Campden Hill Square for twenty-five women and one man.<br>
<br>Both Georgina and Marie Brackenbury agreed with the increasing militancy advocated by Christabel Pankhurst. At the beginning of March 1912 they took part with their mother in a mass demonstration in the West End of London. Their mother, aged seventy-nine, was accused of breaking windows in the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall and served eight days on remand before being sentenced to fourteen days in Holloway prison. Georgina and Marie were also arrested and sentenced to fourteen days in prison. Suffragette prisoners who went on hunger strike and who were temporarily released from Holloway prison under the government's <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span> were given shelter in the Brackenbury family home in Campden Hill Square, which became known as &#145;Mouse Castle&#146;. There the &#145;mice&#146; were able to avoid police surveillance and re-arrest. In June 1914 the house became the temporary headquarters of the WSPU following a police raid on their Westminster offices. The Brackenburys' cottage at Peaslake was also used as an informal convalescent home for released prisoners.<br>
<br>After the First World War and the partial extension of the franchise to women in 1918 Georgina Brackenbury resumed her artistic career. An unsigned watercolour of Christabel Pankhurst (Museum of London) may be her work. In 1927 she completed a fine portrait of Emmeline Pankhurst (NPG) late in life. Following Mrs Pankhurst's death in 1928 Margaret Haig Thomas, second Viscountess Rhondda, Katherine (Kitty) Marshall, and Rosamund Massy raised money to purchase it for the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Like many of their activist contemporaries Georgina (known in her family as Ina) and Marie were vegetarians and interested in theosophy. In the 1930s they had a country cottage in Bushey in Hertfordshire. Marie died, unmarried, in London on 2 February 1945. Georgina, recalled as tall and friendly but rather formidable, died on 27 January 1949 in St Mary Abbot's Hospital, Kensington, also unmarried. She left 2 Campden Hill Square to the Over Thirties' Association. A plaque, now in the Museum of London, was commissioned for the house, later adapted to accommodate vulnerable and needy women by the charity, renamed Housing for Women, to which it was bequeathed.<br>
