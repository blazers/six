<span class="headword">James,  Clara Grace <span class="st"> [Claire]</span></span>  (1866&#150;1954), <span class="occ">trade unionist and community activist</span>, was born at 24 John Street, Deptford, Kent, on 30 October 1866, the daughter of George James, journeyman tailor, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Corse. According to her patron, Lilian Gilchrist Thompson, she was orphaned as a child and brought up by an alcoholic employee of her father's. She first came to notice as an activist in the industrial world in 1889, when she joined the Women's Trade Union Association (WTUA). The WTUA was formed in the East End of London after the success of the Bryant and May match girls' strike of 1888, with the aim of establishing self-managed and self-supported unions for women in trades neglected by the more skills-focused Women's Trade Union League. Following dismissal from her job in the confectionery trade for joining a union, James became assistant secretary of the WTUA and a union organizer. As secretary of the Confectioners' Union, she assisted Clementina Black and John Burns to resolve the chocolate makers' strike in 1890. This union failed in 1892, the WTUA annual report suggesting that its demise was partly due to employers' opposition and partly to the notorious difficulty of organizing young girls: juveniles were increasingly employed in this trade. In 1891 Clara James and her friend Amie Hicks (in whose household she was now living, according to the census as Hicks's adopted daughter) were appointed as delegates to the royal commission on labour. They were the only women to give evidence, and they both spoke in favour of women factory inspectors, stipulating that these inspectors should be working women, not ladies. James was also for some time the only woman delegate on the London Trades Council.<br>
<br>Clara James worked as a typist to earn her living, until in 1892 a personal admirer, Lilian Gilchrist Thompson, promised the WTUA a subscription of &pound;70 a year for two years to employ Clara James as an investigator. By 1894 the WTUA was in difficulties, and its fifth annual report noted that Clara James had been unable to organize the box-makers, adding that &#145;The collapse of the Union did not conclude Miss James' efforts among the boxmakers. She has been constantly among them &hellip; and gathered much information which will &hellip; be put into a systematic form&#146;. In November 1894 the WTUA was re-formed as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96080', "Women's Industrial Council")</script> (WIC); James served on the investigation and organization committees. Thompson, who described James as a lively, persuasive personality, paid for her to train as a gymnastics teacher after the two years' subscriptions had expired. James had set up her first working girls' club under the WTUA, where among other activities she organized extremely successful musical drill classes: according to the WTUA's fifth annual report, these classes were emulated by the People's Palace in London's Mile End Road. Clubs for working girls were to occupy much of the rest of her life.<br>
<br>In 1899 the WIC set up the Clubs Industrial Association, which arranged lectures on industrial subjects (including the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>), social meetings, and citizenship classes for affiliated working girls' clubs. James used her popular physical drill classes to gain the trust of the working girls, and to persuade them to help the women factory inspectors to convict employers in breach of the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>. The classes in themselves were beneficial to girls physically constrained by factory life, and offered both fun and better health. Margaret Bondfield, later a Labour cabinet minister, was among her pupils. By 1909 James had her own organization, separate from the Clubs Industrial Association, called Working Girls at Play, based at 21 Rochester Square, London: she was the overall organizer of twenty-two clubs and hundreds of girls all over London. Ill health eventually prevented her from continuing as a teacher, and she established a holiday home on Canvey Island. At first it was little more than a campsite, but it was eventually replaced by a house with a self-supporting market garden. From 1925 James served as a parish councillor, justice of the peace, and school governor. Clara James died at her home, The Willows, Lakeside Path, Canvey Island, Essex, on 10 August 1954.<br>
