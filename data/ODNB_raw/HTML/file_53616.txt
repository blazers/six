<span class="headword">Shand,  Alexander Allan</span>  (1844&#150;1930), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 11 February 1844 at Turriff, Aberdeenshire, son of James Shand, surgeon, and his wife, Margaret Allan. According to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary he was trained in a Scottish bank before he joined the Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China in the early 1860s in Hong Kong. By 1864, at the age of twenty, he had arrived in Yokohama, Japan, as acting manager of the bank's sub-branch. Takayoshi Kido (1833&#150;1877), one of the most influential and gifted of the newly empowered Japanese oligarchs, anxious to set the new Japan on a sound financial basis, made friends with Shand and, impressed by his clear discussion of banking problems, recommended him to the Japanese ministry of finance.<br>
<br>Tempted by the extraordinarily high salary of 450 yen a month (a Japanese cabinet minister earned 500 yen a month), Shand started work for the ministry by writing, in English, a book on bank accountancy. <span class="italic">The Detailed Account of Bank Bookkeeping</span> was published, in Japanese, by the ministry in December 1873.<br>
<br>In November 1874 Shand, who had earlier been on home leave in Britain, organized lecture courses on economics and public finance in the ministry. More than 300 aspiring young Japanese bankers attended. Joseph Heco 
    (Hikozo Hamada; 1837&#150;1897)
   was Shand's chief interpreter and translator. Early in 1875 he undertook the first Western-style bank inspections, following the collapse of a long-standing finance house, Ono. Shand advised the Japanese to establish a central bank, but this was a concept the Japanese were then unable to accept. (The Bank of Japan was established in 1882 by Masayoshi Matsukata.) Shand recommended that Japanese bankers follow English and Scottish banking rules. Before leaving Japanese service Shand himself produced another two books, <span class="italic">On Banking</span> (1877) and the <span class="italic">Manual of National Banking</span> (1877&#150;8). He left Japan in March 1877; his sponsor, Takayoshi Kido, died, aged forty-three, in May 1877.<br>
<br>During his stay in Japan, Shand married Emmeline Christmas (1848&#150;1913). They had eight children, including Montague, who died as a child of dysentery in Japan. The other children were Margaret, Helen, Ida, Winifred, Norman, Evan, and Hubert.<br>
<br>Back in London by 1878 Shand entered the service of the Alliance Bank in London. On the amalgamation of the bank with Parr's Bank in 1892 he assumed the managership of the Lombard Street branch. From 1896 Shand was head office manager of Parr's Bank at Bartholomew Lane. In the early years of the twentieth century, especially during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904&#150;5, Shand was a crucial figure in forming syndicates to launch successful Japanese loans on the London money market. His Japanese partner in this endeavour was Korekiyo Takahashi (1854&#150;1936), then deputy governor of the Bank of Japan and later finance and prime minister, who had in the 1860s been messenger boy for Shand in Yokohama. For these services, over several years, particularly during the Russo-Japanese War, the emperor Meiji conferred on him the fourth order of the Rising Sun in 1902, the third order of the Sacred Treasure in 1904, the third order of the Rising Sun in 1906, and the second order of the Sacred Treasure in 1908. Parr's Bank also expressed its thanks to Shand by awarding him several substantial gifts of money. In 1908 Shand was elected to the board of directors; he finally retired from Parr's Bank in 1918, when it merged with the Westminster Bank.<br>
<br>Shand retired to Ardmore, Ardmore Road, Parkstone, Dorset, with his daughters Ida and Winifred. His wife, Emmeline, had died in 1913 in Upper Norwood. On 12 April 1930 he died at his Dorset home from influenza; he was cremated on 16 April at Woking crematorium, Surrey. Shand's estate (his will was probated at &pound;7582) was not great, probably the result of losses he sustained following the great earthquake in Yokohama and Tokyo in September 1923.<br>
