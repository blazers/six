<span class="headword">Strange,  Alexander</span>  (1818&#150;1876), <span class="occ">army officer and scientist</span>, the fifth son and youngest of twelve children born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26640/', "Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange (1756&#150;1841)")</script> and his second wife, Louisa (1788&#150;1862), daughter of Sir William Burroughs, baronet, was born in London on 27 April 1818. He entered Harrow School in September 1831, but left in 1834, aged sixteen, for India, on receiving a commission in the 7th Madras light cavalry (22 June 1834). He was promoted lieutenant on 10 May 1837. In India his flair for mechanics and invention was noted and, after studying at the Simla observatory, he was appointed on the recommendation of Andrew Waugh, in 1847, second assistant to the great trigonometrical survey of India. He was employed on the Karachi longitudinal series, extending from the Sironj base in central India to Karachi, and crossing the Thar Desert north of the Rann of Cutch. He began work in 1850 as first assistant to Captain Renny Tailyour, but after the first season Tailyour withdrew and Strange took chief command of a task which proved onerous because of the absence of building materials and the need to provision 200 men in the desert. The triangulation of the section was completed on 22 April 1853. The series was 668 miles long, consisted of 173 principal triangles, and covered an area of 20,323 square miles: Strange performed the task with great skill and rapidity. After this work was ended, Strange, as astronomical assistant, joined the surveyor-general, Sir Andrew Waugh, at Attock to help measure a verificatory base-line. In 1855 he joined the surveyor-general's headquarters office, and in 1856 was placed in charge of the triangulation southwards from Calcutta to Madras, along the east coast. In 1859 he was promoted major, and, in accordance with the regulations, retired from the survey. He received the special thanks of the government of India.<br>
<br>Strange returned to England in January 1861 and retired from the army in December of that year with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In England he persuaded the government to establish a central department for the inspection of scientific instruments for use in India, and was appointed to organize it, gaining the office of inspector in 1862. Hitherto the government's system for the construction of scientific instruments for official use had been to keep a stock of patterns, invite tenders for copying them, and accept the lowest, thus preventing any chance of improvement in the instruments, and affording no guarantee of their quality. Strange abolished the patterns, encouraged invention, ensured competition as to price by employing at least two makers for each class of instrument, and enforced strict supervision. A marked improvement in design and workmanship was soon evident, and his first decennial report showed that the cost of the new system was only about 0.028 per cent of the outlay on the works where the instruments were employed. For the trigonometrical survey he himself designed and superintended the construction by Troughton and Simms of a great theodolite, two zenith-sectors designed to give the maximum power for the minimum weight, and two 5 foot transit instruments for the determination of longitude. The instruments were tested in an observatory which he designed at the Indian store depot at Lambeth. His design and testing procedures proved so effective that the speed and accuracy of Indian survey work increased markedly.<br>
<br>Strange was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Astronomical societies in 1861, and of the Royal Society on 2 June 1864. He took an active part in their proceedings. He served on the council of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1863 to 1867, and as foreign secretary from 1868 to 1873. He contributed several papers to the society's journals. He was on the council of the Royal Society from 1867 to 1869. He used his influence in scientific circles to argue for government support for scientific research and his advocacy was instrumental in the appointment in 1870 of the royal commission on this question.<br>
<br>Strange was a good public speaker, a capable artist, and a good violinist. He died at 97 Onslow Square, London, on 9 March 1876 of &#145;Indian fever&#146; and a feeble heart. His wife, Adelaide, daughter of the Revd William Davies, probably predeceased him. They had three daughters, including Julia Fanny, his sole executor, and a son, Alexander Burroughs, a civil engineer in Madras.<br>
<br>Strange was a perceptive scientist, one of the few, for example, to recognize the importance of Babbage's calculating machines and the extent to which intellectual advance depended on the manufacture of precision equipment. His experience in the army led him to believe that science could achieve most if pursued collaboratively in well-organized departments with government support. He urged on government the duty of devising a coherent scientific policy, shaped by scientists. Dismissing the idea that local initiatives, individual enterprise, or the Royal Society (a private body) should or could undertake such strategic planning, he argued that a great scientific council, a standing commission modelled on the Council of India, should be appointed to advise government, under a minister for science. The state should support basic scientific research by well-paid, full-time researchers in government laboratories. Applied science should be fostered in industrial centres. A science museum should be set up to encourage good instrument design. Strange was not the first or the only scientist to urge a consistent government policy for science, but he was at the time its most forceful advocate. He was opposed by those who feared that increased government involvement would hamper individual scientists' freedom, that a council of science would leave the Royal Society without a purpose, and that the concentration of science in government institutes would undermine the universities. Others, like Richard Strachey, a friend of Strange's who shared his Indian background, supported his ideas. The royal commission of 1870 adopted most of Strange's ideas, but its fundamental recommendations were not implemented in his lifetime, or in the subsequent century.<br>
