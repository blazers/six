<span class="headword">Walton,  James</span>  (1802/3&#150;1883), <span class="occ">card clothing manufacturer and innovator</span>, was born at Stubbin, Sowerby, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Isaac Walton, a merchant. On 27 July 1830 he married Ann Kenworthy, of Millbank, Sowerby, at St John's Church, Halifax. As a young man he was in business as a cloth dresser, or friezer, and developed a new method of friezing petersham, a type of heavy woollen cloth. He then turned his attention to the manufacture of card clothing, a brush-like material consisting of wire staples set in a flexible backing which is used to cover the rollers on carding and cloth finishing machines. Employing a mechanic from January 1834 to help in his experiments, Walton first produced a synthetic backing for his card clothing which combined india rubber with a woven fabric. Patented in March 1834, it was to prove the effective substitute for leather for which the card-making trade had long been searching. Walton's next achievement was to build an improved card-setting machine, patented in 1838, which set 300 teeth per minute, five times the rate of earlier machines. His task had been considerably eased by the adoption of his rubberized material, which proved much easier than leather to work in a machine. The machine was first shown in public at an industrial exhibition organized by the Sowerby Bridge Mechanics' Institute, of which Walton was chairman, in 1839. It revolutionized the trade, quickly replacing thousands of hand-setters previously employed around Halifax.<br>
<br>In order to profit from his innovations, Walton left Yorkshire, for the patented machine worked best with the rubber backing which was not then suitable for carding wool. He joined the existing partnership of Curtis and Parr, card makers, in Store Street, Manchester, about 1839. Curtis and Parr were also machine makers, having succeeded to the business of Joseph Chessborough Dyer, whose machine had provided the basis for Walton's improvements. Walton seems to have become sole proprietor of the firm by about 1846, when he built a large new factory in Chapel Street, Ancoats. This was followed by a move in 1853 to yet larger premises at Haughton Dale, Denton, near Manchester, where he worked in partnership with his two surviving sons, William (<i>b</i>. 1831) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67799/', "Frederick Edward Walton")</script>, the inventor of linoleum. His sons received some of the credit for later innovations, including the &#145;endless sheet machine&#146;, which made card setting a continuous process, and developments in wire-drawing. Walton's machine-made card clothing was of a superior quality to handmade cards, at about a third of the price.<br>
<br>Although Walton did not formally retire until he was in his late seventies, he spent increasing periods away at his various country estates, at Compstall in Derbyshire, at Cwmllygodig in Merioneth, and then at Dolforgan Hall, Ceri, near Newtown, Montgomeryshire, an estate of 4250 acres which he had bought for &pound;5000 in 1870. He served as sheriff of that county in 1877. Walton maintained an interest in social and moral issues, and built a school for his child employees. He founded and endowed the church of St Mary the Virgin in Haughton in 1876, at a cost of &pound;4000, and also gave generously to an ancient church near his estate in Kerry. He died at Dolforgan Hall on 5 November 1883, at the age of eighty. He had survived an operation for cancer two years earlier, but died of the disease after a short illness.<br>
