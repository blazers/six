<span class="headword">Ward,  Samuel</span>  (1572&#150;1643), <span class="occ">theologian and college head</span>, was born at Bishop Middleham, co. Durham, the son of John Ward, a man of &#145;more ancientry than estate&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 7038, p. 355), and baptized on 13 January 1572. He matriculated pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1589, graduated BA in 1593, and proceeded MA in 1596. His financial condition while a student was precarious: James Montagu and William Perkins helped him with his college debts. The diary and sermon notebook he kept from 1592 to 1601, along with other notebooks collected in the Sidney Sussex archives, reveal that he was in his youth a vigorous and outspoken puritan, devoted to biblical studies and to intense introspection and self-castigation for his most trivial sins. An ardent admirer of Perkins and of Laurence Chaderton, he was like them much troubled by the introduction of popish &#145;ceremonies&#146; into the Church of England, by clergy &#145;too pontifical and papistical&#146;, and generally by the &#145;sins of the land&#146;, especially &#145;want of zeal&#146; and &#145;coldness in our holy profession&#146; (Sidney Sussex College, Ward MS B, fols. 30<i>v</i>&#150;31; MS 45, fol. 62<i>v</i>). He was thus a natural choice for election to a fellowship of Emmanuel College in 1596 and in 1610 to the mastership of the newest puritan foundation, Sidney Sussex College, where he remained until his death. He proceeded BD from Emmanuel in 1603 and DD from Sidney Sussex in 1610.<br>
<br>Two major projects occupied Ward during the first decade of the seventeenth century. First, Perkins entrusted to him posthumous publication of his treatise, <span class="italic">Problema de Romanae fidei ementito Catholicismo</span>, which duly appeared in 1611. Second, from 1604 until 1611 he worked on translation of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> for the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was rewarded with multiple ecclesiastical offices, becoming prebend of Yatton in Wells Cathedral (1610), a royal chaplain (1611), archdeacon of Taunton and <i>ex officio</i> prebend of Milverton I in Wells (1615), rector of Great Munden in Hertfordshire (1616), and canon of York (1618). In 1638 the rectory of Terrington, Norfolk, was added to the list.<br>
<br>Evidence of Ward's activities outside Cambridge is sparse. As archdeacon, he apparently did visit Taunton on occasion, and he maintained a house in Wells. His designated surrogates in the archidiaconal court can be identified with puritan colleges in Cambridge and in one case&#151;Walter Vesey, Ward's vicar as prebendary of Milverton&#151;with outright nonconformity. A collection of English sermons in Ward's hand (Sidney Sussex College, Ward MS 0.8) may have been intended for visitations to Taunton or to one of his rectories. Apart from one on the Gunpowder Plot, their concern is with the state of the heart, and the language is designed to stir the emotions. The style and tone of his vernacular preaching are strikingly different from his Latin academic sermons, which are restrained in tone, rigorously logical, and tightly focused on specific theological questions. His extant sermons are few in number. While committed to the principle that &#145;Christ frameth men by the word preached&#146;, as he wrote in his diary, Ward suffered from a speech impediment that had almost caused him to choose mathematics rather than divinity as his field  (Sidney Sussex College, MS 45, fols. 51, 46<i>v</i>); it was Perkins who had persuaded him to study theology.<br>
<br>Ward's principal commitments were always to his college, to biblical and theological scholarship, and especially to the maintenance of Calvinist orthodoxy. His notebooks reveal that administration of the college and its properties occupied much of his time, and also that he devoted attention to areas of scholarship rather new to early modern universities, purchasing globes, maps, and scientific instruments for the college and participating in scholarly exchanges with historians and antiquaries as well as divines. Highly regarded by the other college heads for meticulous scholarship and integrity of life, he was elected vice-chancellor of the university for 1620&#150;21, increasing his administrative burden but not diminishing his theological efforts. The preponderance of both his writing and his use of time was always for theological ends. The virulent anti-Catholicism visible in his edition of Perkins's work is also evident in his actions from 1610 to 1643 as a member of the university vice-chancellor's court, where he actively prosecuted those who articulated &#145;popish&#146; notions in university sermons. In the 1636 case against John Normanton of Gonville and Caius College, for instance, he added his own detailed list of complaints to the official charges against this obviously Catholic fellow  (Sidney Sussex College, Ward MS F, fol. 28).<br>
<br>Ward also addressed what he regarded as the enemy within protestantism. An outspoken Calvinist, he was one of the five British delegates sent by the king in 1618 to the Synod of Dort, where Episcopius found him &#145;the most learned member&#146;  (J. Hacket, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 1675, xxvi). Historians of the synod have associated Ward with John Davenant against the other three delegates in lending support to the remonstrant doctrine of universalism; however, a debate he recorded with the synod's president, Johannes Bogerman, indicates that the rift was more apparent than real. Ward argued that Christ's death won only the possibility of salvation for all and remained merely potential for the reprobate, God having selected some persons but not others &#145;liberare efficaciter ex massa damnata&#146; (&#145;to free efficaciously from the mass of the reprobate&#146;; Sidney Sussex College, Ward MS L.4, fol. 3<i>v</i>). Ward joined the other delegates in full support of all five articles of the synod against the remonstrants in <span class="italic">The Collegiate Suffrage of the Divines of Great Britain</span> (1619, tr. 1629). A few years after his return to England he was made Lady Margaret professor of divinity (1623), from which position he continued to affirm his commitment to strict predestinarianism. His university sermon, <span class="italic">Gratia discriminans: concio ad clerum habita Cantabrigiae</span> (preached 1625, published 1626) labels the doctrine of resistible grace a &#145;perversa notione&#146; and the idea of free will &#145;radix non paucorum errorum&#146; (&#145;root of many errors&#146;; pp. 18&#150;19).<br>
<br>In the changed theological atmosphere following the accession of Charles I, Ward found this orthodoxy increasingly threatened by new Arminian heads, supporters of &#145;novelties in both rites and doctrines&#146;, advanced to power in the university by the court  (<span class="italic">Whole Works of &hellip; Ussher</span>, 15.581, 500&#150;1, 405). In 1629 he was among those censured by the vice-chancellor, Matthew Wren, for purchasing William Prynne's <span class="italic">Anti-Arminianisme</span>; later in the year he departed from his reputation for eirenicism by engaging in a name-calling match with Jerome Beale in the consistory over his own <span class="italic">Gratia discriminans</span>. He continued actively to defend Calvinists and puritans and oppose Arminians and ceremonialists along with Catholics before the vice-chancellor's court, but with less success than he had enjoyed in the previous reign. Puritans like Thomas Edwards (1628), Nathaniel Bernard and Richard Spynke (1632), William Strong (1634), Christopher Goad (1635), and Thomas Riley (1636) were forced to recant or leave the university for objecting to altars, ceremonies, and Arminian doctrine; anti-Calvinists and ceremonialists like John Tourney and Peter Hausted (1634) and Sylvester Adams and Anthony Sparrow (1637) were exonerated over the vociferous protest of Ward and other Calvinist heads. By 1634 Ward had begun to fear for his own position. He complained to archbishop James Ussher that he had never found university affairs &#145;in a worse condition since I was a member thereof&#146;, with Calvinists &#145;disgraced and checked, &hellip; as myself was &hellip; for favoring puritans in consistory&#146;&#151;a reference to his recent defence of the Sidney Sussex puritan John Barcroft in the vice-chancellor's court  (<span class="italic">Whole Works of &hellip; Ussher</span>, 15.579&#150;81, 16.521).<br>
<br>Placing Ward along the spectrum of puritans and conformists is none the less a challenge. Clearly in his twenties he identified himself with the Cambridge puritan circle of Perkins and Chaderton, and the spiritual anxieties expressed in his diary are classic puritan fare. But his mature vernacular sermons show a continuity in his experimental spirituality, and his complaints about corruption and &#145;novelties&#146; in the church and about popular irreligion continued throughout his life. He was one of the licensers of George Carleton's book attacking Richard Mountague. His actions on the vice-chancellor's court, including his opposition to Laudian metropolitical visitation of the university in 1635, all identify him with a puritan opposition and won him approbation by William Prynne  (<span class="italic">Canterburies Doome</span>, 159&#150;92). Puritans regularly consulted him about matters of conscience, judging him &#145;a man famous for learning and of high estimation &hellip; for his soundness of faith and integrity of conversation&#146;, as Nicholas Estwick remarked in 1634  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 71, fols. 186&#150;7). Sidney Sussex College under his leadership continued its tradition of attracting puritans and their sons (including the presbyterian Thomas Edwards, Oliver Cromwell, and the sons of Samuel Ward of Ipswich, John Rogers, and Thomas Gataker) as well as Calvinist refugees from Heidelberg. As master he maintained strict discipline, even ordering surprise raids by tutors on their students' rooms to ensure godly behaviour  (Sidney Sussex College, <span class="italic">Acta collegii</span>, p. 39, fol. 3 from the back). When in 1643 the iconoclast William Dowsing visited Cambridge for parliament he had few complaints about Ward's college: the chapel remained unconsecrated and communion was celebrated at a table rather than an altar, without rail or cross. Ward was invited to be a member of the Westminster assembly of divines as one of two representatives of the university, suggesting that he was perceived by presbyterian puritans as an ally. On the other hand, he supported episcopacy, he was clearly a pluralist, as archdeacon he would have had a seat in convocation, and despite his own strict sabbatarianism he argued in 1634 that the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> ought to be read for the sake of obedience and order. He maintained close friendships and produced a voluminous lifelong correspondence with Calvinist bishops like William Bedell, Ussher, John Davenant, and Arthur Lake. The puritanism of his youth seems at least to have moderated as he matured. Correspondence with Bedell suggests that he came to realize that if he were to maintain a position from which he could teach true doctrine and preach the gospel, he would have to keep his complaints about the present state of the church muted and compromise on issues he deemed of less importance than the evangelical mandate. His student Thomas Fuller noted that he &#145;turned with the times&#146;, but found him &#145;a true protestant at all times&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.488).<br>
<br>It is almost as difficult to place Ward along the political spectrum. His writings suggest a traditional devotion to monarchy, as to episcopacy, but he befriended and sheltered the Dutch republican Isaac Dorislaus when in 1627 the latter fell into disfavour for lectures construed as advocating republicanism and the legitimacy of regicide. In the 1620s he privately criticized the king for sabbath breach and &#145;indulging papists&#146; and the queen for &#145;want of religion&#146;  (Sidney Sussex College, Ward MS B, fol. 31). In 1642 he declined personally to offer financial assistance for the royalist war effort, and he failed to make good on his college's promise of &pound;100 for the king. On the other hand, in March 1643 Ward also refused on behalf of his college to give financial aid to parliament, despite a personal plea from Cromwell. With parliamentarian troops then occupying Cambridge, Ward was imprisoned in St John's College, accompanied voluntarily by his faithful servitor Seth Ward (unrelated, later bishop of Salisbury). Released early in August because of illness contracted in the dank conditions of his imprisonment, Samuel Ward died in the master's lodge at Sidney Sussex on 7 September 1643 and was buried in his college chapel; he was survived by his wife, Martha, about whom nothing further is known. A funeral oration was given in Great St Mary's by Henry Molle, the public orator, on 30 November, and a sermon was preached by Ralph Brownrigg, but the most eloquent tribute to Ward's saintly life, his scholarship, and his strict enforcement of discipline in his college is Seth Ward's prefatory eulogy to the posthumous collection of his theological works, <span class="italic">Opera nonnulla: determinationes theologicae, tractatus de justificatione, praelectiones de peccato originali</span> (1658); he called his former master Errorum Malleus  (sig. A3<i>v</i>), a title that Ward would doubtless have embraced. Another treatise, <span class="italic">De baptismatis infantilis vi et efficacia disceptatio</span>, also posthumously published (1653) as part of a debate among nonconformists about the nature of baptism, stands testimony to Ward's enduring importance to puritan theology.<br>
