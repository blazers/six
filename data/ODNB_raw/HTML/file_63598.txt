<span class="headword">Gales,  Joseph</span>  (1761&#150;1841), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and radical</span>, was born at Eckington in north Derbyshire on 4 February 1761, the eldest son of Thomas Gales, a village school teacher. His early years were spent assisting his father, after which he was apprenticed to a printer in Manchester. He absconded after he was attacked by his master's wife and returned to Eckington. In the early 1780s he completed his apprenticeship with James Tomlinson, a printer of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. On 4 May 1784 he married Winifred Marshall (1761&#150;1839), novelist and political writer, who was a daughter of John Marshall, an innkeeper of Newark and a cousin of Lord Melbourne. His lifelong companion, Winifred was a woman of considerable ability and learning who studied Latin as a child and by the age of fourteen had read the works of Shakespeare, Milton, and Adam Smith. In adult life she contributed passages of political analysis to her husband's newspaper, together with commentaries for Gales's edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and a novel, <span class="italic">Lady Emma Melcombe</span>. The marriage produced eight children, five daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>Following his apprenticeship Gales moved to Sheffield, where in 1787 he established a reformist weekly, the <span class="italic">Sheffield Register</span> (first number 8 June), in partnership with David Martin. Like many publishers of that era, Gales was also a printer, stationer, auctioneer, and insurance agent. The valuation on his own property in the Hartshead area of the town shows that he possessed buildings and equipment worth &pound;500 in 1787.<br>
<br>As an editor Gales pursued a reformist agenda for the abolition of slavery, educational improvements, canal building, and, especially, the removal of legal constraints on religious dissenters. Gales was himself a Unitarian and, in line with his religious beliefs, regularly condemned the &#145;evils&#146; of popular recreations such as bull-baiting, cock-fighting, and boxing. Under his editorship the <span class="italic">Register</span> became the voice of the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information, an artisan-based political club founded in late 1791 and comprising up to 2000 members. Gales held no office in the organization but was a founder member who once chaired one of its larger public meetings in 1793. Like many similar radical clubs, the Sheffield society advocated a radical extension of the franchise as a means to secure political reform. Such was the support for reform in Sheffield that demonstrations organized by the society could attract 5000&#150;10,000 supporters, while the <span class="italic">Register</span>, with its innovative coverage of local news and reprints of the writings of liberal thinkers, often sold 2000 copies of individual issues during the early 1790s. Gales also published the first cheap edition of Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span> (6 <i>d</i>.) and a short-lived fortnightly periodical, <span class="italic">The Patriot</span> (1792&#150;4), which included political essays, extracts from reformers such as Paine, Joseph Priestley, and James Mackintosh, and correspondence with and the addresses of other reform societies. Gales himself had links to these wider circles of dissenters and political radicals including Priestley and Thomas Walker of Manchester. He may also have met Paine during the latter's visit to Yorkshire in the late 1780s. In March 1792 Gales, along with several other members of the Sheffield society, was elected an associate member of the London-based Society for Constitutional Information.<br>
<br>Gales's profile also brought him to the attention of Pitt's government, especially during the period of state trials in 1794. At the start of that year he was accused of writing an anonymous letter to Thomas Hardy, secretary of the London Corresponding Society, which discussed the possibility of distributing arms (pikes) to supporters of political reform. Facing arrest, Gales left Sheffield for Derby and thereafter left the country. Winifred Gales was left behind to arrange the sale of the <span class="italic">Sheffield Register</span> to his former assistant, James Montgomery, before joining her husband in exile.<br>
<br>The family went first to Hamburg in Germany before sailing for America. While in Europe, Gales studied several languages and learned shorthand, a skill he used to good effect in later political journalism. After arriving in Philadelphia in 1795, he worked first as a printer, reporter, and bookkeeper before starting his own paper, the <span class="italic">Independent Gazetteer</span>. Following advice from members of the Republican Party, he re-established himself in North Carolina and in October 1799 started the <span class="italic">Raleigh Register</span>. Through this publication he continued his political career as a liberal reformer in the Jeffersonian mould. He served as the mayor of Raleigh for nineteen years and was state printer for several decades. An abolitionist who owned slaves, Gales also promoted the cause of Unitarianism as well as publishing his newspaper until retirement in 1832. His son Weston continued as editor and maintained the family's publishing interest in the <span class="italic">Congressional Record</span>.<br>
<br>Gales lived for several years in Washington with his eldest son, also Joseph, who was a journalist and was mayor of Washington between 1827 and 1830. The elder Joseph Gales died in Raleigh, North Carolina, on 21 July 1841.<br>
