<span class="headword">Wright,  Stephen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">architect</span>, may have been born in Oxburgh, Norfolk, to the poor of which village he left &pound;20 in his will, and he appears to have begun his professional life as a clerk or assistant to William Kent. He was probably the &#145;Stephen&#146; referred to in letters from Kent to Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, in 1738&#150;9; he received a legacy of &pound;50 under Kent's will, dated 1748; and the following year he was in possession of some of Kent's drawings. In 1746 he was appointed to a post in the office of works, as clerk of the works at Hampton Court, presumably through the influence of Burlington; and his subsequent career was based on that institution and the patronage of one leading public figure, Thomas Pelham-Holles, first duke of Newcastle.<br>
<br>How and when Wright's link with Newcastle was established is not clear&#151;it may have been through his employment to complete the London house which Kent had designed for the duke's brother Henry Pelham (1695&#150;1754), after Kent's death in 1748&#151;but there is plentiful evidence of the connection. In 1758, four years after he had added the clerkship of Richmond New Park Lodge to that he held at Hampton Court, when the comptroller of the works, Thomas Ripley, was dying, he wrote to Newcastle to apply for his post; and although in the event the preferment went to Henry Flitcroft, it was by Newcastle's &#145;immediate appointment&#146; that Wright was promoted to the posts of master mason and deputy surveyor vacated by the latter. Equally, the greater part of the work in his small private practice came from the duke and his successor. Newcastle employed him at Claremont, Surrey (1752), and as chancellor of Cambridge University secured his employment to design the university library (1754&#150;8); while for the second duke he worked at Clumber House, Nottinghamshire (1768&#150;78; dem.), and designed the bridge in Newark in the same county (1775). The Cambridge library, his most important work, is an accomplished Palladian composition in the manner of William Kent, while in his additions to Milton Hall, Berkshire (1764&#150;72), he provided some attractive interiors in the Kentian Gothic style.<br>
<br>&#145;An honest and worthy man&#146;, in the words of his office of works colleague Kenton Couse, he died after &#145;a lingering tho' not very painful illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the King's Works</span>, 5.89) on 28th September 1780. He was buried in the churchyard at Hampton, Middlesex.<br>
