<span class="headword">Stewart,  John, of Baldynneis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;<em>c.</em>1605), <span class="occ">courtier and writer</span>, was the second son of John Stewart, the fourth Lord Innermeith (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1570), member of the privy council of Scotland (1565&#150;9), and Elizabeth Betoun (the mistress of James V, who &#145;gifted&#146; her the marriage). It is probable that he attended the University of St Andrews, graduated in the 1560s, and spent a substantial period of time in France and Italy. After his father's death, Stewart became involved in the personal and political controversies of his mother's second marriage, to James Gray, brother of the fifth Lord Gray, which was subsequently dissolved at the instigation of Elizabeth Stewart on grounds of adultery on 10 June 1581. Stewart, acting as one of the executors of the paternal estate, took possession of Red Castle in Perthshire in opposition to the property claims of his stepfather. This led to a series of direct conflicts in which Stewart, with the aid of Andrew Gray of Dunninald, defended Red Castle, and his mother's right to it, against the attacks of Gray. Gray charged Stewart before the privy council at Stirling with unlawful seizure of Red Castle. Stewart failed to appear at trial. On 1 April 1579 he was ordered to surrender the castle to Gray. In May Stewart sought legal redress and Robert Erskine of Dun was solicited to ensure that the castle would be defended and Stewart brought safely before the council. The protection of Erskine's forces was not sufficient to prevent Gray's pillaging of the Red Castle estate. In September Stewart pleaded his mother's financial distress before the council and ensured temporary residence for the family at Red Castle until the divorce was granted.<br>
<br>Possibly in order to secure the protective alliance with Andrew Gray of Dunninald, Stewart entered a marriage contract at Red Castle on 19 November 1579 with Catherine Gray, his daughter. This alliance, however, was broken on 27 February 1580 and, despite the marriage which took place on 25 July 1580, again a year later when both Andrew and James Gray with impunity attacked Red Castle. On 26 April 1580 Stewart inherited the estate of Baldynneis in the parish of Dunning in Perthshire from his brother James, Lord Innermeith. Stewart's financial and material situation improved between 1582 and 1583 as he won legal proceedings against Andrew and William Gray. In 1585 Stewart and his mother entered a contract with his brother's widow to obtain an income from estates in Perthshire and Stirlingshire, while he appears to have forfeited his rights to the properties of Laithers and Durlaithers in Aberdeenshire.<br>
<br>Stewart's subsequent material and political circumstances until his death <i>c</i>.1605 are unknown. From his marriage with Catherine Gray he had one son, David. The domestic and political trouble that he endured through the legal controversies of his mother's divorce may be partly responsible for the markedly anxious, placatory relationship with James that his writing portrays.<br>
<br>Stewart was a significant literary member of the court of James VI. His poetry illustrates the precarious literary and political &#145;contract&#146; between the poet&#150;courtier and the sovereign who &#145;prescribed&#146; the poetic renaissance of which Stewart sought to be part. Stewart is the most rhetorically innovative and experimental of the Jacobean, or self-declared &#145;Castalian&#146;, writers of this period [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95583', "Castalian band")</script>]. His poetry survives in a single manuscript folio which, through its careful and embellished inscription, was probably intended as a presentation gift to the king. It contains a partial translation of Ariosto's <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span> (the &#145;Roland Furious&#146;), a collection of lyrics entitled &#145;The Rapsodies of the Authors Youthfull Braine&#146;, and a religious allegory, &#145;Ane Schersing out of Trew Felicitie&#146;. No work can be dated precisely, but the dedication alludes to James's <span class="italic">Reulis and Cautelis</span>, published in 1584, and the &#145;Rapsodies&#146; contain similarly dedicatory &#145;new year&#146; lyrics inscribed 1582 and 1583. Stewart's most prolific period of production can be placed within this decade.<br>
<br>Stewart's poetry as a whole shows the important role of translation in the Scottish Jacobean Renaissance, reflecting a bias towards French sources. Many sonnets in the &#145;Rapsodies&#146; collection are modelled on those of Philippe Desportes (1546&#150;1606). The rhetorically experimental quality of Stewart's virtuosic lyrics shapes the mannerist aesthetic of contemporary Castalian writing. Stewart's Ariostian translation is also indebted to French intermediaries: not only to Desportes's <span class="italic">Roland furieux</span> but in particular to the earlier translations of Jean Martin and Gabriele Chappuys. Stewart's mode of translation illustrates the concepts of elaboration and expansion which James outlined in the <span class="italic">Reulis and Cautelis</span>, and, given the provisionality of dating in this period, may even have defined the parameters of translation to the king.<br>
<br>The &#145;Rapsodies&#146; is an excellent exemplar of the nature of Castalian coterie poetry. Stewart's poetry is courtly and occasional (it includes an epithalamion). Sexual satire, secular love poetry, lyrics on the art of poetry, and kingly eulogies form a heterogeneous collection.<br>
<br>&#145;Ane Schersing out of Trew Felicitie&#146; closes the manuscript as a recantation or moral epilogue to the manuscript's largely secular nature. The poem exemplifies the Castalian vogue for allegory and is an important text in the evolution of protestant poetics in Renaissance Scotland. The poem sustains Stewart's conventional rhetoric of praise, supplication, and apologia to James, while the manifestation of the goddess Urania alludes to the king's translation of Du Bartas's <span class="italic">Uranie</span>. The poem concludes by blending both monarchical and divine praise, as adoration of God fuses with that of Stewart's &#145;godlie king&#146;.<br>
