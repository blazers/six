<span class="headword">Talbot,  Thomas</span>, second Viscount Lisle  (<em>c.</em>1449&#150;1470), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of John Talbot, first Viscount Lisle (<i>d</i>. 1453), and Joan Chedder, and the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26932/', "John Talbot, first earl of Shrewsbury (d. 1453)")</script>, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54469/', "Margaret Talbot n&#233;e Beauchamp")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26932/', "Talbot, John, first earl of Shrewsbury")</script>]. He inherited his lands, titles, and claims from his paternal great-grandmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56573/', "Elizabeth Berkeley, countess of Warwick")</script>. His inherited lands, including Kingston Lisle in Berkshire, which he entered on coming of age in 1469, were worth approximately &pound;200 p.a. His father died on the field of Castillon when he was just five and Talbot became the ward of his grandmother. On her death in 1467 he became the heir to two claims: lands settled on his father from the Talbot inheritance, and the lordship of Berkeley. She had been in possession of Painswick from the Talbot inheritance and the other Gloucestershire manors of Wotton under Edge, Cowley, and Simondshall from Berkeley.<br>
<br>Lisle immediately faced a challenge from William, Lord Berkeley. Both parties resorted to violence; Berkeley attacked Wotton and Lisle attempted to seize Berkeley Castle. In March 1470, taking advantage of the Lincolnshire rebellion and the collapse of royal authority, Lisle challenged Berkeley to battle. Marching down to confront Berkeley at the head of a band of armed tenants and retainers, he was ambushed on 19 March on Nibley Green, between Berkeley and Wotton. Wounded in the face by an arrow, he was finished off by a dagger-thrust. The skirmish on Nibley Green is supposedly the last &#145;private&#146; battle fought in England; it was certainly symptomatic of the manner in which the participants in private feuds took advantage of the dynastic conflicts of the Wars of the Roses to settle their own differences.<br>
<br>Nibley Green brought half a century of local conflict to an end. In 1466 Lisle had married Margaret (<i>d</i>. before 1503), youngest daughter of William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. He died childless; and she reputedly miscarried when Wotton manor was sacked after the skirmish. His title, inheritance, and claims passed to his sister Elizabeth, who in 1475 married Edward Grey, younger son of Edward Grey, Lord Ferrers, and brother of Queen Elizabeth Woodville's first husband. He made a formal release of all his claims on the Berkeley inheritance in 1482, but retained possession of Painswick.<br>
