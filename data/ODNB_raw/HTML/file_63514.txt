<span class="headword">Johnson,  Richard</span>  (1753&#150;1807), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and collector of oriental art and manuscripts</span>, was born on 16 November 1753, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57457/', "Alexander Johnson MD (bap. 1716, d. 1799)")</script>, lawyer, and of his wife, Mary Pellins (<i>b</i>. 1720, <i>d</i>. in or after 1800). Johnson's family had lived for at least two generations in the Netherlands and he was born and brought up at The Hague. His father held the office of agent for the estates of East Friesland and the town of Emden.<br>
<br>Appointed a writer on the Bengal establishment of the East India Company's service on 5 October 1769, he arrived at Calcutta on 25 September 1770. His letters home suggest that he felt himself under a strong compulsion to advance his career in India as rapidly as possible in order to make money to pay off family debts. His early service was spent in the company's central administration at Calcutta, where he was able to impress his superiors by his intelligence and capacity for business. Through his appointment in the personal office of the governor, he began a sometimes uneasy relationship with Warren Hastings. It was rumoured that he had been instrumental in negotiating the divorce that left Hastings free to marry his second wife. In addition to his official duties, Johnson ran a private agency business in partnership with Richard Croftes, his superior in the company's accountant-general's office. The firm managed the affairs of clients and specialized in arranging remittances to Britain. Johnson also looked after his younger brother Alexander, who had joined him in India, obtaining a valuable contract for him.<br>
<br>Johnson manoeuvred with some dexterity, even deviousness, among the bitter rivalries on the company's Bengal council. He cultivated Hastings's opponent General John Clavering and later the new commander-in-chief Sir Eyre Coote, through whom, it would seem, he obtained in 1780 the extremely lucrative appointment of deputy to the company's resident at the court of the wazir of Oudh at Lucknow. Johnson certainly took the opportunity of making money at Lucknow with both hands, but he took other opportunities as well. He was a fine linguist, reputed to have a good knowledge of Persian and Arabic as well as of Urdu, and he clearly found the culture of the court at Lucknow much to his liking. Since the downfall of the Mughal emperors at Delhi, Lucknow had become the major centre of artistic patronage in north India. Johnson himself became the patron of poets, he had a taste for Indian music, and he acquired both a large number of Sanskrit and Persian manuscripts and a most important collection of miniatures. An Indian artist's portrayal of Johnson shows him as a short, sharp-featured man.<br>
<br>The company residents at Lucknow were required to implement Warren Hastings's policies of extracting resources from the wazir to settle his debts to the company. This involved them in highly contentious measures such as the attempted confiscation of some of the assets of the wazir's mother and grandmother, the begums of Oudh. Johnson was notably ruthless in pursuing such measures, later attracting the unfavourable notice of Edmund Burke, who called him &#145;the outrageous Mr Johnson&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 8.202). Although Johnson confidently expected to succeed to the post of resident, he had, however, lost the governor's confidence and in 1782 he was recalled, ostensibly for preventing the transfer from Oudh of a sum of money promised personally to Hastings by the wazir.<br>
<br>Johnson's fortune evidently suffered severely from his recall. He told his mother that although he was commonly thought to be worth &pound;150,000, he had &#145;dissipated in folly the best part of what fortune threw within my reach&#146; and in a series of penitential letters blamed himself for &#145;avarice, ambition and licentiousness&#146; as well as &#145;vanity and self-conceit&#146;  (letters of 16 Nov 1783 and 30 Aug 1784, JRL, Eng. MS 191, nos. 27 and 34). His problems were exacerbated by the failure of the business of Croftes and Johnson, which was dissolved in 1785, leaving Johnson with heavy obligations when Croftes died insolvent in the following year.<br>
<br>Johnson was, however, able to restore his reputation if not his fortune. With assurances of goodwill from Hastings, he was appointed to the prestigious but not very lucrative residency with the nizam of Hyderabad in 1784. There at least he could add Deccani paintings to his collection. Recalled from Hyderabad in 1785, he again served in the company's revenue administration at Calcutta and launched proposals for a public bank. He was highly regarded by discriminating men. William Jones learned &#145;Indian Mythology&#146; from him  (Cannon, 316) and called him &#145;one of the most distinguished of the Company's servants&#146;  (Jones, 2.854). Lord Cornwallis's government commended him as a &#145;very able, Zealous and deserving Servant of the Company&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fort William&#150;India House Correspondence</span>, 322).<br>
<br>In 1788 Johnson sent ahead of him to Britain part of what he called his &#145;live lumber&#146;, two girls, presumably the daughters of an Indian mother, whom he wished to be educated with the &#145;moderate expectations&#146; that would fit them for &#145;decent husbands&#146;. A boy and a girl were to follow and there were two little girls still too young to travel  (letter to his mother, 9 Nov 1788, JRL, Eng. MS 191, no. 43). Forced to leave India by illness, Johnson himself took his passage in February 1790.<br>
<br>Johnson settled in London. He married Sophia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6453/', "John Courtenay MP")</script>, on 1 March 1792. They had four daughters and a son. To supplement his limited resources, Johnson hoped for a new career in public life, entering parliament in 1791 as member for Milborne Port; he retained his seat until 1794. In 1792, however, he turned again to banking with various partners, including Nathaniel Middleton, the resident to whom he had acted as deputy at Lucknow. Warren Hastings and his wife were among the clients of the business situated at Stratford Place, off Oxford Street. Johnson was &#145;the president and acting manager&#146; until 1803, when he was deposed  (note, JRL, Eng. MS 179a, fol. 46). By that time he was in serious financial difficulties. He had to leave his house, sell his collection of books and paintings, and prepare to go back to India. He died insolvent at Brighton on 19 August 1807.<br>
