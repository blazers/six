<span class="headword">Cohen,  Chapman</span>  (1868&#150;1954), <span class="occ">freethought writer and lecturer</span>, was born in Leicester on 1 September 1868, the elder son of Enoch Cohen, a Jewish confectioner, and his wife, Deborah Barnett. His upbringing was more noted for the absence of Christianity than for any positive Jewish features. He attended a local elementary school but was otherwise self-educated. Although an avid reader, versed in Spinoza, Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and Plato by the time he was eighteen, he was scarcely aware of the freethought movement in which he was to spend his life when he moved to London in 1889. A chance encounter with a Christian Evidence lecturer in Victoria Park in 1890 led him to respond to the speaker, and this brought an invitation to lecture from the local Secular Society. Some months later he joined the National Secular Society and was soon in demand as a lecturer, delivering over 200 lectures a year. He was elected a vice-president in 1895. The following year he was appointed temporary editor of the Bradford <span class="italic">Truthseeker</span> and in 1898 became assistant editor of G. W. Foote's <span class="italic">Freethinker</span>. He was clearly Foote's ablest young lieutenant, and in 1915 on Foote's death he was appointed both editor of the <span class="italic">Freethinker</span> and president of the National Secular Society.<br>
<br>Cohen was a witty, courteous, and effective public speaker and debater, and a prolific writer with over fifty titles to his credit. Typical of his writings are <span class="italic">A Grammar of Freethought</span> (1921), <span class="italic">Theism or Atheism</span> (1921), <span class="italic">Materialism Restated</span> (1927), and four series of <span class="italic">Essays in Freethinking</span> (1923&#150;38), culled from occasional pieces in the <span class="italic">Freethinker</span>. His achievement was to transform Victorian freethought from an emphasis on anti-biblical argument to the positive advocacy of materialism, and his views were put before a wider public when he debated &#145;Materialism: has it been exploded?&#146; with C. E. M. Joad at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, in 1928. In 1940 he published <span class="italic">Almost an Autobiography</span>, which provides a charming insight into his character and ideas but is frustratingly thin on biographical fact. As an organizer Cohen did much to build up the resources of secularism in the inter-war years, but by 1949, when he was persuaded to resign as president, many members felt he had stayed on too long. He remained editor of the <span class="italic">Freethinker</span> until 1951.<br>
<br>Cohen was married on 31 August 1897 to Cecilia Alice (1874&#150;1966), the daughter of Walter James Holyfield, a customs officer. They had two children, Raymond Chapman (<i>b</i>. 1908), who survived his father, and Daisy, who died shortly after her marriage in 1928 or 1929, aged twenty-nine. Cohen himself died on 4 February 1954 at Warley Hospital in Brentwood. He was cremated at Golders Green on 11 February.<br>
