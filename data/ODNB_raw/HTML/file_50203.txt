<span class="headword">Yelverton <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Henry]</span>, Sir  Hastings Reginald</span>  (1808&#150;1878), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in March 1808, was the son of John Joseph Henry of Straffan, co. Kildare, and his wife, Lady Emily Elizabeth Fitzgerald, daughter of the duke of Leinster. He entered the navy on 20 August 1823 as a first-class volunteer with Captain Samuel Pechell on the frigate <i>Sybille</i>, in the Mediterranean. In June 1826 he was present at a severe action with pirates off Candia, Crete. He later served as a midshipman and mate on the home station in the brig <i>Columbine</i> (Captain William Symonds), the frigate <i>Undaunted</i> (Captain Augustus Clifford), and the battleship <i>St Vincent</i> (Captain Sir Hyde Parker). On 18 December 1830 he was promoted lieutenant, and in the following year joined HMS <i>Asia</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir William Parker, at Lisbon. In 1834 he joined the <i>Rattlesnake</i> (34 guns, Captain Hobson) in the East Indies, and was promoted commander on 28 June 1838. Between 1840 and 1843 he served on the home and Mediterranean stations aboard the steam vessels <i>Styx</i> and <i>Devastation</i> and as acting captain of the battleship <i>Queen</i> and the frigate <i>Aigle</i>. He achieved post rank on 23 September 1843.<br>
<br>On 9 April 1845 Henry married Barbara (1810&#150;1858), widow of George Augustus Francis Rawdon Hastings, second marquess of Hastings, and only daughter of Henry Edward Gould (afterwards Yelverton), Lord Grey of Ruthin, and <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Grey of Ruthin. Henry in January 1849 by royal licence took the name Yelverton in place of Henry. In 1853 he was appointed to command the steam screw frigate <i>Arrogant</i> (46 guns) in the western squadron, and he remained in her during the Baltic campaigns of 1854 and 1855. On 19 May 1854 he led a cutting-out expedition at Eckness, several miles from the coast. The following year he was often in independent local command, destroying Russian government buildings, forts, and supplies along the Finnish coast. In July 1855 he was created CB for his services. For the 1856 campaign he moved to the 80 gun steam battleship <i>Brunswick</i> with command of a gunboat flotilla for inshore operations. The war ended before he could see any service in this capacity.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1859 Yelverton was appointed comptroller-general of the coastguard, a post he retained until April 1863. Promoted rear-admiral on 30 January 1863, he served as second in command on the Mediterranean station until 1866, when he became commander-in-chief of the channel squadron for one year, in recognition of his ability, to conduct sailing and steaming trials. The results convinced Yelverton that shorter, handier ironclads were required. Promoted vice-admiral on 25 May 1869, he served on the committee appointed by Hugh Childers to consider the turret ship design, later HMS <i>Devastation</i>, put forward by the chief constructor, Edward Reed. As a result of the committee's report the design was adopted. On 2 June 1869 Yelverton was created KCB (GCB 29 May 1875).<br>
<br>Yelverton was again temporarily commander-in-chief of the channel squadron from July to October 1870, before assuming command in the Mediterranean, where he remained until January 1874. The major episode of this period was the international effort to restrict the Cartagena revolt in 1873, where he helped to suppress the rebellion, prevented a bombardment of Valencia, and blockaded the rebel fleet.<br>
<br>Yelverton, by then profoundly deaf, was an unexpected choice to succeed Sir Alexander Milne as first naval lord in September 1876; the shortage of suitable flag officers left the government little choice after the post was refused by Admiral Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby. Yelverton, always a stopgap, served little more than a year before ill health forced him to resign in November 1877. He died in the Grand Pump Hotel, Bath, on 24 July 1878.<br>
<br>At the Admiralty Yelverton proved an ineffective member of an ineffective board, under George Ward-Hunt, entirely subordinate to the economic demands of the Disraeli ministry. The mid-1870s marked the nadir of the navy in the nineteenth century, and reflect no credit on those involved. Yelverton's appointment in succession to Milne, replacing the most experienced and effective naval lord of the era with a man who had never before served at the Admiralty, was indicative of the limited interest of the Disraeli ministry in naval policy. At sea Yelverton was a fine officer, as his extended periods of active service demonstrated. His opinions on ship design and tactics were highly regarded, although his predilection for short and handy ships resulted in the <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Agamemnon</i>, two of the worst battleships ever built for the navy. A conservative in all things, Yelverton made a worthy contribution to the efficiency of the seagoing navy, and his short term at the Admiralty proved a sad coda to an otherwise successful career.<br>
