<span class="headword">Bacon,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1717, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">merchant and ironmaster</span>, the son of William Bacon and his wife, Elizabeth Richardson, was baptized at St Bees, Cumberland, on 24 January 1717. His father and grandfather Thomas were ships' captains in the coal trade between Whitehaven and Ireland, though his father also made several trading voyages to the Chesapeake. His mother died in 1725, when he was eight, and his father a few years later, and the boy was taken to Talbot county on the eastern shore of Maryland, where he was raised by his maternal uncles, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1734) and Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1741) Richardson, who were merchants there. Young Anthony was trained by them as a merchant and as a mariner. He apparently made a good impression for, on coming of age, he was in 1738 made master of the <i>York</i>, a vessel in the Maryland tobacco trade owned by John Hanbury, the leading London tobacco importer.<br>
<br>After the death of his two uncles, Bacon found himself the guardian of his uncle Anthony's two young sons, Anthony and Thomas Richardson. He then moved to London, from where he operated as an itinerant merchant mariner during the period <i>c</i>.1742&#150;1747 and as a resident merchant thereafter. In the 1740s he traded primarily with Maryland, but in the 1750s added Virginia and the Spanish wine trade. During the Seven Years' War he entered government contracting in collaboration with John Biggin, a native of Whitehaven and a large London coal merchant (who had been a major navy victualling contractor in the 1740s). Bacon was recognized as a specialist in shipping, and he provided vessels and carrying services to the Royal Navy. He was a major transporter of victuals in the Quebec campaign of 1759. In the later stages of the war he also branched out into army contracts, undertaking to victual and pay the troops stationed on the African coast at Fort Louis, Senegal, and at Goree. This transaction was in part an extension of his trade with the Canaries, source of both wine and coin for his African contracts.<br>
<br>His experiences in wartime contracting revealed new possibilities to Bacon. Although he continued to be active in North Carolina, he withdrew from the tobacco trade in 1764. Instead he sought to develop a strong presence&#151;both trading and contracting&#151;in Britain's new acquisitions in Africa (Senegambia) and the West Indies (the ceded islands&#151;St Vincent, Tobago, Dominica, and Grenada). His agents and vessels in each area could handle both contracts and trade. His contracting business included providing pay and provisions to the army and navy and leasing slave labourers to the army in the ceded islands for fortification construction. In his own business he gave particular attention to obtaining slaves for sale in America and gum seneca, much in demand in England for use in dyeing cloth. To help with these complex schemes, he acquired new partners: in 1756, Gilbert Francklyn, a young gentleman from Maidstone; and in 1761 his own cousin and ward, Anthony Richardson, whom he had brought from Maryland in 1742.<br>
<br>This complex network of contracts required substantial advances from the crown. To attract the necessary ministerial understanding, Bacon obtained election to the House of Commons from 1764 to 1784 from the venal and costly borough of Aylesbury, previously represented by John Wilkes. In the house he played an important part in the passage of the <span class="roman">Colonial Currency Act</span> of 1764, a measure restricting the ability of colonial legislatures to issue paper money. Though the Board of Trade had originally favoured such a bill, the ministry hung back; but Bacon introduced the bill on his own, and, after mollifying some of the opponents by agreeing to restrict its scope, procured its passage with the support of the two members of the Board of Trade in the house. Bacon was personally interested in the bill inasmuch as he had substantial sums owing him in America, particularly in North Carolina. In parliament he consistently supported both the government of the day and parliament's full authority <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the colonies. At the same time he advised ministers that it was inexpedient to tax the colonies, even though parliament had an undeniable right to do so.<br>
<br>As the American crisis developed, Bacon publicized his expediency argument in three pamphlets: <span class="italic">The true interest of Great Britain, with respect to her American colonies &hellip; by a merchant of London</span> (1766), <span class="italic">Considerations on the Present State of the North American Colonies</span> (1769), and <span class="italic">A short address to the government, the merchants, manufacturers and the colonists in America, and the sugar islands, on the present state of affairs, by a member of parliament</span> (1775), though the authorship of the first is not definite. Only twenty copies of the second were printed, as Bacon intended to restrict distribution to members of the government.<br>
<br>By the 1770s Bacon found his numerous contracts more trouble than they were worth, and gradually gave up those for Africa and the Antilles. At the outbreak of the American War of Independence, however, he returned to victual contracting, primarily in the British Isles, and also became heavily involved in the manufacture of cannon. He owned a coal mine in Workington, near Whitehaven, and was connected to families interested in iron furnaces and foundries thereabouts. Such links led to his acquaintance with the Cumberland ironmasters Isaac Wilkinson and his son John. It was probably through Isaac Wilkinson, then residing in Bristol, that Bacon was introduced to the iron-making potential of south Wales. In 1765 he leased lands and mining rights at Cyfarthfa, Glamorgan, where he and a cousin by marriage, Dr William Brownrigg, of Whitehaven, Cumberland, built a coke-using ironworks. The next year Bacon purchased a share in the nearby Plymouth works from Isaac Wilkinson and John Guest, its founders, and in 1780 he purchased the balance of Plymouth plus the nearby Hirwaun works. At that point Bacon owned three of the four significant coke iron furnaces in the Merthyr Tudful area. His interest in these works was heightened by the American war and by his association with John Wilkinson, who in 1773 had developed a new technique for manufacturing cannon by boring. Bacon persuaded the Board of Ordnance of the superiority of the new method and obtained large orders for such cannon. These were at first manufactured by Wilkinson at Brosely, Shropshire, but, after Wilkinson's patent was declared void by the attorney-general, Bacon abandoned his support for Wilkinson and started to make the cannon on his own in Wales. He moved his principal residence from London to Cyfarthfa to supervise his nearby furnaces and cannon foundry. The shifting of his interests from African and West Indian commerce to south Wales iron making is an extremely clear (if not necessarily common) example of the migration of capital from slave-based commerce to domestic industry.<br>
<br>Neither the date of marriage nor the precise identity of Bacon's wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1799), is known. Their only child, Anthony Richardson Bacon, was born in 1757 but died in 1770. While his wife remained at the Cyfarthfa residence, Bacon, as a member of parliament, spent much time in the capital, where he kept a mistress, Mary Bushby, during the years <i>c</i>.1770 to 1786. At his death, in Cyfarthfa on 21 January 1786, Mary was left with their daughter, Elizabeth, and four sons, Anthony, Thomas, Robert, and William, of whom only the first two reached adulthood. Bacon was buried in London, at St Bartholomew by the Exchange. He made generous provision in his will for Mary Bushby and for the education of her children. He left his ironworks to his sons, but the two survivors, Anthony and Thomas, when they came of age, first leased and then sold their inherited undertakings and lived as rentiers. The Cyfarthfa works, which about 1807 were the largest ironworks in the world, were operated for over a century by the Crawshay family until absorbed into Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds in 1902. The Plymouth works were acquired by Richard Hill, an employee of Bacon who had married Mary Bushby's sister. His family controlled and managed the Plymouth Iron Company until the original works were closed about 1860.<br>
