<span class="headword">Lang, Sir  William Biggart</span>  (1868&#150;1942), <span class="occ">machine tool manufacturer</span>, was born on 19 September 1868 at 59 High Street, Johnstone, Renfrewshire, the youngest of five sons in the large family of John Lang (<i>c</i>.1825&#150;1906), machine tool maker, and Annie Biggart. His father had founded his own firm in 1874 in Johnstone, a town which had seen its early growth closely linked to the development of the cotton industry. As the cotton industry began to decline, engineering expanded from the mid-nineteenth century; and John Lang &amp; Sons was a typical example of a firm set up to serve the needs of the shipbuilding and engineering trades, and which specialized in the production of lathes.<br>
<br>Lang was educated at Paisley grammar school, followed by attendance at classes at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College. He became an apprentice in his father's firm, learning all aspects of engineering. This pattern of education and training was similar to that followed by his brothers, three of whom also joined the family business. A fourth joined the well-known company of G. and J. Weir Ltd of Cathcart, Glasgow.<br>
<br>By the time that Lang joined it, the firm had established a significant presence in the engineering industry: it served every shipyard on the River Clyde, exhibited at international exhibitions, and its customers nationwide included the British Admiralty, Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co., and Messrs Vickers and Maxim. Expansion and modernization of the premises in 1893 and 1899, with a workforce increased to 350, established John Lang &amp; Sons as one of the foremost machine tool manufacturers in Scotland, if not Great Britain. It was during this decade of expansion that Lang became more involved in the running of the business. He became a partner in 1895, aged only twenty-seven. The decade of the 1890s also saw Lang's marriage, on 15 June 1897, to Agnes, the daughter of James Barr, a well-known local businessman in the firm of James McDowall &amp; Sons, saw mill engineers. They had a family of three daughters.<br>
<br>His father retired in 1898, and when the firm became a private limited company in 1916, Lang served as its first managing director, and also as chairman from 1927. He had few interests in other companies, devoting his business life to the family firm and to the machine tool trade. From 1912 he was a member of the North West Engineering Employers Association, serving as its president in 1921&#150;2. John Lang &amp; Sons played an important role in munitions in both world wars, and from 1915 Lang became chairman of the machine tool committee of the Ministry of Munitions. The first chairman (1917&#150;22) of the Associated British Machine Toolmakers Ltd of London, he also served on the tariff advisory committee of the Machine Tool Trades Association, and in 1934 became president of the Machine Tool Trades Association. A member of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland from 1906, he also served on the various boards and committees of the Engineering and Allied Employers Federation.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Lang was involved in local affairs in Johnstone. He was a councillor from 1908, and in 1914 succeeded his brother John as provost. He served three consecutive terms until his retiral in 1923. A JP for Renfrewshire, he was president of the local YMCA from 1911, and a member of the committee of management of Paisley Savings Bank from 1932. For most of his life he was a member of the Johnstone High Church. In honour of his services to the local community and national contribution to the machine tool trade, he was awarded a knighthood in 1937.<br>
<br>Lang died at a nursing home at 121 Hill Street, Glasgow, on 17 February 1942 after a short illness, and was buried on 19 February. His wife predeceased him the year before. His death occurred at a time when John Lang &amp; Sons was again playing a key role in the production of munitions, and especially lathes for aircraft guns and tank parts. Aided by other members of his family who were involved with the firm, Lang successfully endeavoured to keep the concern at the forefront of the machine tool industry.<br>
