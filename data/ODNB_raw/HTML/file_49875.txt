<span class="headword">Lipson,  Henry Solomon</span>  (1910&#150;1991), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 11 March 1910 at 107 Wavertree Road, West Derby, Liverpool, the third and last child of Israel Lipson, shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Friedlander. All his grandparents were Polish Jewish emigr&eacute;s who settled in Liverpool at the end of the nineteenth century. Shortly after his birth his father's business failed and, to support his family, Israel used his only asset, his considerable physical strength, and became a steelworker at Shotton, Flintshire. Lipson's mother managed the home well and also encouraged her children to become educated. From 1921 to 1927 Lipson attended Hawarden grammar school where he developed his lifelong interest in physics. At the age of seventeen he was awarded the Henry Neville Gladstone scholarship and a Flintshire county exhibition, and began studying physics at Liverpool University, eventually obtaining a first-class honours degree and the Oliver Lodge prize in 1930. The award of a demonstratorship enabled him to stay in Liverpool to do research. Lipson teamed up with another research student, one year his senior, C. A. Beevers. They were set the task of solving crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data and they had to make all their own equipment. Since they had no idea how to use their data they sought advice from Professor Lawrence Bragg, who had set up a world centre for crystallography in Manchester. With his help they solved a number of structures, including that of copper sulphate. This required extensive calculations, and Beevers and Lipson invented an aid to calculation, the Beevers&#150;Lipson strips, which were widely used and immortalized their names in crystallography.<br>
<br>As a demonstrator Lipson continued to do research in Liverpool, together with some teaching, until 1936 when Bragg invited him to work in Manchester with Dr J. A. Bradley on the structure of metals. However, in 1937 Bragg became director of the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington and just one year later he replaced Lord Rutherford as the Cavendish professor at Cambridge. Bradley and Lipson accompanied him on each of these moves. It was while at Teddington that, on 12 December 1937, Lipson married Jane 
    (Jenny; <i>b</i>. 1909/10)
  , an invoice clerk, and daughter of Samuel Rosenthal, master tailor.<br>
<br>Lipson was, <i>de facto</i>, in charge of the crystallography group in Cambridge. Many young researchers&#151;for example Max Perutz (later a Nobel laureate)&#151;benefited from the care and effort he lavished on them. Lipson also tried to instil in them a sense of serving the needs of other scientists and of society at large. In his turn Lipson was influenced by others at the Cavendish. In particular, contact with P. P. Ewald made him realize the importance of the Fourier transform in relation to X-ray crystallography&#151;something that influenced all his subsequent research. Lipson's stay in Cambridge was scientifically successful but he was never fully integrated into the life of the university. He was awarded a Cambridge MA in 1942, adding to the DSc awarded by Liverpool in 1939, but he never became a member of a college.<br>
<br>In 1945 W. H. Taylor became head of the crystallography group at the Cavendish and Lipson moved with his family to take over Taylor's vacant post at the Manchester College of Technology (later the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology). The post to which Lipson moved, head of the physics department, carried with it little status and no title. Lipson built up crystallographic research so that within a few years the college became an important world centre. He began a new optical approach to solving crystal structures, based on ideas first suggested by Bragg and exploiting the Fourier transform theory he had learned from Ewald. Initially the physics department was wholly involved in service teaching but in 1951 Lipson established an applied physics degree course. He believed in establishing a sound foundation to the learning process and he particularly enjoyed giving first-year courses. In 1954 he was given the title of professor and in 1957 he became a fellow of the Royal Society. By 1967 the character of the department began to change and new areas of research, such as meteorology and plasma physics, had been introduced. By the time he retired, in 1977, the department was established as a centre of high quality and varied research.<br>
<br>Lipson was active, in different ways, in both the international and local spheres. He served as the British co-editor of <span class="italic">Acta crystallographica</span> for twenty years, and he served two terms as president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the only person to have done so in the twentieth century. He was also an enthusiastic voluntary worker at the local Withington Hospital. He strongly believed that science should be used for the benefit of mankind and he was a supporter of Pugwash (the movement among scientists to promote the peaceful application of scientific discoveries) and of SANA (Scientists Against Nuclear Arms). For his many services to society he was appointed CBE in 1976. His many activities did not detract from his central interest in life&#151;his family. His three children, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1938), Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1941), and Judith (<i>b</i>. 1943) all became scientists, although he did not coerce them in any way. The death of his younger daughter from leukaemia in 1990 devastated both Henry and Jenny Lipson.<br>
<br>In 1991 the Lipsons were visiting their son, Stephen, a professor of physics at the Technion in Haifa, Israel. After a happy family day with grandchildren, Lipson went to bed and shortly after suffered a heart attack from which he died the same night, on 26 April. He was buried the next day in Haifa, close to his son's home.<br>
