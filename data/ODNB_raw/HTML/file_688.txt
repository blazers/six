<span class="headword">Arnold,  Thomas James</span>  (1803&#150;1877), <span class="occ">barrister and literary translator</span>, was born on 6 July 1803 in Downing Street, Westminster, London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/683/', "Samuel James Arnold (1774&#150;1852)")</script>, dramatist, and Matilda Catherine Pye (<i>d</i>. 1851), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22918/', "Henry James Pye, MP")</script> and poet laureate. He was educated at St Paul's School and the University of G&ouml;ttingen, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 13 November 1824 and called to the bar on 24 November 1829. His first wife was Emily Frances, only daughter of Francis Coust, chairman of the Middlesex quarter sessions. He married again on 12 September 1867, this time to Prudentia Sarah Jefferson, the only child of the barrister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13475/', "Thomas Jefferson Hogg")</script>.<br>
<br>As a lawyer, Arnold chose the northern circuit and became a commissioner of bankruptcy at Liverpool. He then worked in London and in 1847 he was appointed magistrate at the Worship Street police court; he transferred to the Westminster court in 1851. He still held his appointment and was senior London police magistrate at the time of his death. He died on 20 May 1877 at his home, 1 Greville Place, Kilburn Priory, London, survived by his second wife; he was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Arnold wrote legal manuals on the law of municipal corporations and on labour laws. However, he also had broad cultural interests and was fluent in Greek, Latin, and several modern languages. He became known for his translations of Goethe's <span class="italic">Reineke Fuchs</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">Faust</span> (1877), and his versions of poems by Anacreon (1869). In addition he translated various works by Euripides, Aristophanes, Xenophon, and Ovid. He became a member of the Numismatic Society in 1862, and he contributed regularly to the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span>. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was also a close friend of the novelist and poet Thomas Love Peacock. His father-in-law Thomas Hogg was the biographer of Shelley.<br>
