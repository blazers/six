<span class="headword">Fiachra</span> <span class="st"> [St Fiachra, Fiacre]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>mid-7th cent.), <span class="occ">monastic founder</span>, was an Irish <i>peregrinus</i> (wandering holy man) who settled at Breuil in the Merovingian Frankish kingdom of Neustria. He is associated with St Faro (<i>fl</i>. 650), bishop of Meaux, and with fellow Irish saint Kilian (<i>d</i>. 689?) of nearby Aubigny. Although Breuil developed into a considerable abbey, little is known for certain about Fiachra. He is commemorated in the twelfth-century Irish martyrology of Gorm&aacute;n on 30 August. The compiler of the martyrology, M&aacute;el Muire Ua Gorm&aacute;in, describes Fiachra as a prince, hermit, and resident of France. Undoubtedly this information came from outside Ireland. There is no evidence that Fiachra was remembered in the traditions of the Irish church and he is not mentioned in any of the earlier Irish martyrologies.<br>
<br>Fiachra's cult, then, seems to have been initially confined to Neustria, whence it spread widely. This growth necessitated a life of the saint that would fill out his meagre biography. Probably dating from the twelfth century, the life of Fiachra is of little historical value. It brings him into contact with Faro and Kilian as well as portraying him as a sort of spiritual successor to the earlier and more famous Columbanus. According to the life, Faro granted Fiachra the site of the future monastery of Breuil and the latter, in a fashion regarded as typical of the Irish ascetic saints, founded a small hermit's cell far away from worldly temptations. Despite his remoteness Fiachra's reputation for holiness attracted many disciples and eventually the cell was transformed into the monastery of Breuil. Typically, too, Fiachra developed friendships with other saints, chief among them Kilian, who is presented as being very much in the same mould as Fiachra. In other ways, the life is characterized by a concern that male religious should keep well away from the temptations of the proximity of women that reflects the tenor of ecclesiastical life after the Gregorian reforms of the eleventh century. Overall, though, the life mainly served as an adjunct to Fiachra's flourishing cult.<br>
<br>This cult's vigour made Breuil into a popular pilgrimage destination. In 1234 the saint's remains were enshrined by Bishop Peter of Meaux, with the exception of his arm which was kept in a separate reliquary. Later, in 1439, the wooden containers that held the remains of Fiachra and those of Kilian were placed together in a silver shrine. In 1568 these were moved to the cathedral of Meaux. The shrine was opened in 1617 and again in 1637 and on the latter occasion Cardinal Richelieu received some of the saint's vertebrae. Fiachra's shrine is an object of devotion to this day. He was considered capable of curing the tumour known as &#145;le fic de St Fiacre&#146; and is also a patron of gardeners, presumably because of the physical labour he engaged in during the years he lived in his hermit's cell at Breuil&#151;iconographically he is often represented carrying a spade. It seems clear that the doings of the real Fiachra have been lost and in their place the legendary personality of the healing gardener saint has taken root.<br>
