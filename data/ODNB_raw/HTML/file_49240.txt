<span class="headword">MacGillivray,  (James) Pittendrigh</span>  (1856&#150;1938), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Port Elphinstone, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, on 30 May 1856, the eldest son of a mason sculptor, William MacGillivray, and his wife, Margaret Pittendrigh. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1868, and in the following year, aged thirteen, MacGillivray was apprenticed to the sculptor William Brodie. On the expiry of his apprenticeship, in 1875, he moved to Glasgow, where he became an assistant to James Steel, for whom he carved the decorative sculpture on the Scotia Theatre (afterwards known as the Metropole). He then worked for John Mossman, whom he assisted on the Glasgow statues of Thomas Campbell (1877) and David Livingstone (1879). In 1882 he established an independent practice, and three years later received his first public commission, for a bronze portrait bust of General Gordon (Glasgow Art Gallery).<br>
<br>While in Glasgow, MacGillivray worked as a painter as well as a sculptor, and it was for his proficiency in painting that he was elected a member of the Glasgow Arts Club in 1882. In the same year he initiated the Palette Club, of which he was the first president. During the 1880s he was closely associated with the group of painters known as the Glasgow Boys, and his was a leading role in the founding and editing of the <span class="italic">Scottish Art Review</span>, the magazine of the Glasgow school. On at least one commission&#151;the funerary monument to Alexander McCall (1888; Glasgow necropolis)&#151;he worked in collaboration with the architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.<br>
<br>From 1890 MacGillivray devoted most of his attention to sculpture, and received his first major commission&#151;a statue of Robert Burns for Irvine&#151;in 1893. In the same year, after a study tour to Brussels, he moved to Edinburgh, where he settled for the rest of his life. He designed his own house and studio, Ravelston Elms, which was built with the assistance of his friend and patron the fourth marquess of Bute. The most notable feature of the project, which was completed in 1896, was the adaptation of the studio for the production of large-scale sculpture. It incorporated an entrance of sufficient height and width to enable MacGillivray to wheel his monumental works out into the open to see what effect they would have outdoors.<br>
<br>MacGillivray attained his greatest success in the late 1890s and the early years of the twentieth century. In this period he received at least twelve major commissions, including six statues for the fa&ccedil;ade of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. But by far the largest and most significant project was his national monument to William Gladstone (1904&#150;13; Edinburgh), which incorporated a portrait statue 9 feet 6 inches high and eight life-size figures, each modelled from life by the sculptor. The emphasis that MacGillivray placed on technique and craftsmanship applied equally to his smaller works. He produced more than forty-five such pieces&#151;portrait, allegorical, and narrative&#151;in these years alone. Like his monumental works they are characterized by originality of composition and an appreciation of symbolism and decorative effect. A stylistic evolution towards increased emphasis on freedom of handling and surface texture in the manner of Rodin is clearly evident after his visit to Brussels in 1893.<br>
<br>In 1903 MacGillivray travelled to Europe again, visiting Rome, Florence, and Brussels. On his return to Scotland he was commissioned by the Scottish education department to prepare a report on art schools and art teaching in Scotland and to offer recommendations for the improvement of facilities. Always outspoken, he unequivocally declared the existing schools unsatisfactory and insisted that priority be given to a sound practical training in craftsmanship. One result of his report was the founding of the Edinburgh College of Art, the scheme of which, as well as the first set of plans adopted by Edinburgh town council, were also his work.<br>
<br>MacGillivray was a man of wide-ranging interests and talents. In 1914 he organized an exhibition of art in aid of Belgian relief. In 1920 he designed the official robes for members of the Royal Scottish Academy. He was a respected authority on the clans and their tartans and was created an honorary member of the Scottish Pipers' Society. He was an honorary fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects, Scotland, and an honorary member of the Aberdeen Artists' Society and of the Scottish Society of Photographic Art.<br>
<br>Literature also claimed MacGillivray's attention. As well as papers on varying subjects and much occasional verse he published two volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Pro patria</span> (1915) and <span class="italic">Bog Myrtle and Peat Reek</span> (1922). The latter, a volume of sixty-one poems, many in the north- and south-country dialects of the Scots tongue, was brought out in a form that reflects MacGillivray's fastidious nature. It was printed privately in a limited edition of 300 signed copies. For the title-page he drew and engraved a heraldic design of the Scottish thistle with a bordure of entwined thistle leaves. The same thistle motif was stamped in gold on the buckram binding.<br>
<br>Like his prototypes of the cinquecento MacGillivray was almost universal in his range: sculptor, painter, architect, musician, orator, and philosopher. Always an ardent nationalist, he made issues of Scottish nationalism and home rule a major part of his writings and oratory. Nor was he afraid to challenge official bodies and institutions. In &#145;Anent the Scots Academy&#146; (in <span class="italic">Bog Myrtle and Peat Reek</span>) he poured scorn on the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1917 he maligned the trustees of the National Gallery of Scotland for not spending a due portion of their acquisitions budget on sculpture. He publicly criticized the policy that no work by a member or associate of the Royal Scottish Academy could be accepted for the national collection until five years after the artist's death. Almost certainly his outspoken nature cost him a knighthood  (Cammell, 108&#150;9) and was a significant factor in his defeat in the election for rector of Edinburgh University in 1932  (NL Scot., MS 3901, fol. 231).<br>
<br>In common with the other outstanding personality of nineteenth-century Scottish sculpture, Sir John Steell, MacGillivray refused to be drawn to London, instead electing to remain in the country of his birth to advance the establishment of a national school of sculpture. His efforts were recognized in 1921, when the office of sculptor royal for Scotland, which had been in abeyance since Steell's death thirty years earlier, was revived for MacGillivray.<br>
<br>MacGillivray was elected associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1892 and member in 1901. An honorary degree of doctor of laws was conferred on him by Aberdeen University in 1909. His work was shown at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1872, 1874, 1875, and 1887, and in almost every year from 1891 to 1938. He exhibited at Paisley, Stirling, Dundee, and London, and at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts from 1875 to 1932, and again in 1938. He held solo artist exhibitions of his work at Glasgow in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1930. Several pieces of his sculpture were shown at the exhibition of the work of the Glasgow Boys arranged by the Scottish Arts Council in 1971. His work was a point of focus in the National Galleries of Scotland exhibition &#145;Virtue and Vision: Sculpture and Scotland, 1540&#150;1990&#146; of 1991.<br>
<br>Pittendrigh MacGillivray died at his home, Ravelston Elms, 41 Murrayfield Road, Edinburgh, on 29 April 1938, and was buried in Gogarburn parish churchyard. His wife, Frieda Rettig (R&ouml;hl), by birth Polish and of French-Huguenot origins, had predeceased him in 1910, and one of his daughters, Erinna, had died in 1917. He was survived by his other daughter, Erhna Mycale, who died unmarried in 1962.<br>
