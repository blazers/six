<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morrell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Cavendish-Bentinck]</span>, Lady  Ottoline Violet Anne</span>  (1873&#150;1938), <span class="occ">literary hostess</span>, was born at 5 Portman Square, London, on 16 June 1873, the youngest child and only daughter of Lieutenant-General Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck (1819&#150;1877) and his second wife, Augusta Mary Elizabeth Browne (1834&#150;1893). Her mother was the younger daughter of Catherine de Montmorency and Henry Montague Browne, dean of Lismore. In 1879 Ottoline's brother Arthur inherited the title and estates of their wealthy and somewhat mysterious relative the fifth duke of Portland. Mrs Bentinck was created Baroness Bolsover in 1880, while her own children, Henry, William, Charles, and Ottoline, were given the titles and precedence of the children of a duke.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Following this change of circumstances, the family moved from East Court, a pleasant manor house in Berkshire, to the few habitable rooms of Welbeck Abbey, a more handsome but forbidding edifice in north Nottinghamshire. Spread below it and connected to the house by a labyrinth of tunnels under the park was the subterranean kingdom created by their reclusive relative, who had stored his possessions away and allowed the house to become derelict.<br>
<br>Ottoline was educated at home by a kind and highly religious governess. Her romantic love of history was stimulated by helping her mother to unpack the Welbeck treasures; these included a magnificent set of Gobelin tapestries and paintings which were stacked, without frames, three deep around the walls of the empty staterooms when they arrived. Here, as she looked at portraits of courtiers &#145;with pearls in their ears and long trailing lovelocks of golden hair hanging over their collars, and of ladies whom they loved, with very low-cut dresses, showing pearly breasts, and embroidered skirts and exquisite shoes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ottoline: the Early Memoirs</span>, 76), Ottoline's enduring love affair with the costumes of the past began. She took inspiration both from her eccentric Stuart ancestor Margaret, duchess of Newcastle, and from the Venetian red and sea-green colouring which she saw in the deserted rooms of Bolsover Castle, a ruined keep which formed part of her half-brother's vast inheritance. The duchess of Newcastle offered her an image of courage, individuality, culture, and simplicity to which she would aspire; Bolsover, &#145;my darling castle&#146;, was both the home she longed to inhabit and a mirror for her own proud reclusiveness. &#145;High, tall, fair and proud it stood&#146;  (Seymour, 35), she wrote in retrospect, but the gift was never made and the castle remained uninhabited.<br>
<br>Baroness Bolsover left Welbeck as a querulous and dependent invalid shortly after her son's marriage in 1889. Ottoline accompanied her, to Chertsey and then to stay with relatives at the Villa Capponi in Italy, before nursing her mother through the final months of illness that ended in her death in 1893. Forced to return to Welbeck at the age of nineteen, she felt herself to be an outsider. The young duchess mocked her attempts to benefit the estate workers by organizing carving classes and offering religious instruction, but Welbeck's new librarian, Arthur Strong, and his wife, the classicist Eugenie Sellers, became her welcome allies. The more worldly affection of William Maclagan, archbishop of York, marked the beginning of a series of troubled relationships with men who were intrigued by Ottoline's unusual beauty (she was almost 6 feet tall, with red-gold hair and turquoise eyes) and by her ardent desire to do good. Other important friendships at this time were with Mother Julian, the aristocratic head of a Cornish sisterhood which Ottoline often visited, and with the author George Macdonald.<br>
<br>In 1896 Ottoline returned to Italy with a chaperone and a distant cousin, with whom she went to St Andrews the following year to study logic for two terms. An invitation from Axel Munthe, the Swedish-born doctor and writer, on her return to London resulted in a visit to his home in Capri with her cousin Hilda Douglas Pennant. The relationship with Munthe was intense but short-lived. Back in England in 1899, Ottoline began studying political economy and Roman history as an out-student at Somerville College, Oxford, probably on the advice of her new admirer, the married Herbert Asquith.<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoPhilipMorrell"></a>Marriage to Philip Morrell</h2>The <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48803/', "Morrell family")</script>, connected to both the law and brewing, owned a fine collection of Italian paintings at Black Hall, their family home in Oxford. Ottoline visited the house to inspect the pictures and returned, dazzling in black satin and pearls, to dine. Philip Edward Morrell (1870&#150;1943), a young solicitor with dreams of being an architect or a Liberal politician, was rapidly enamoured. Encouraged by his socially ambitious mother, he proposed to a woman they wrongly assumed to be an heiress (Ottoline's mother had cut her out of her will). They were married in February 1902, and settled at 39 Grosvenor Road by the Embankment in a house which Ottoline began brightening with the rich but subtle colours she loved. In 1903 she vigorously supported Philip Morrell's campaign for a Liberal seat in Oxfordshire and they rented Little House in the village of Clifton Hampden in order to give him a local address. Ottoline is credited with having restored and designed the garden of that house. Philip Morrell's first illegitimate child, a daughter, was born in 1904.<br>
<br>Philip Morrell won his Oxfordshire seat in 1906, in which year the Morrells moved across London to 44 Bedford Square, the handsome Bloomsbury house which became famous for its owner's bohemian gatherings. There, on 18 May 1906, Ottoline gave birth to twins, a sickly girl and a healthy boy. The boy, named Hugh after Philip's dead brother who had committed suicide in 1897, died within a few days; the girl, who survived, was named Julian in memory of her mother's old friend in Cornwall. Hospitalized shortly after the death of her baby son, Ottoline was told that an operation had ended any chance of her having further children. The child was buried at Clifton Hampden and was in due course (in 1908) joined by his grandfather Frederick Parker Morrell. Ottoline continued to visit the graveyard until her own death, when Julian took on the task of tending her twin brother's grave.<br>
<br>In 1907 the Morrells rented a second home, Peppard Cottage, not far from her childhood home in Berkshire. This was the period during which Ottoline began to be portrayed by a wide variety of painters, from James Pryde to Augustus John, Henry Lamb, and Roger Fry. Some became her lovers; few were able to resist her combination of innocence, aristocracy, and the singularity of a true eccentric. Her style, as they admiringly noted, was all her own, as original and confident as her sense of colour. She created it, on a shoestring budget, by paying her friendly dressmaker Miss Brenton (&#145;Brenty&#146;) to copy costumes from masterpieces which she saw in galleries (Vel&aacute;zquez was a striking inspiration) and to make use of velvets and brocades in startling colours. Encouraged by Miss Brenton, she became increasingly bold. Her high-heeled shoes, often scarlet, had &#145;elevators&#146; in the soles; her velvet hats were sometimes the size of a small cartwheel. This was the arresting and easily mocked figure who, in 1907, began holding weekly parties at Bedford Square for the artists and writers she met and whom she hoped to help by offering introductions to rich patrons. Henry James was among those who feared that her generosity would be abused. He was right.<br>
<br>Ottoline's efforts were often successful. She assisted the careers of Mark Gertler, Jacob Epstein, the Spencer brothers, and Henry Lamb among many others. She was, however, easily ridiculed. Her shyness made it difficult for strangers to discover her sense of humour (she loved going to music halls and singing ditties), and she could appear overbearing and intense. Her religious faith, in an age of atheism, was mocked and distrusted. Virginia Woolf, Vanessa Bell, and Lytton Strachey seldom resisted the temptation to jeer behind her back; Duncan Grant, Maynard Keynes, Augustus John, and the Spencers were among her defenders. In 1909 Roger Fry invited her to join the newly formed Contemporary Art Society, designed to help young artists and to make their work accessible to provincial galleries. Ottoline bought paintings for the new society and provided her cousin, Lord Howard de Walden, as its first president, while her art-loving brother Lord Henry Bentinck became its chairman. In 1910 she became an enthusiastic supporter of the notorious &#145;Manet and the post-impressionists&#146; exhibition.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35875/', "Bertrand Russell (1872&#150;1970)")</script>, Ottoline's lover and lifelong friend, became aware of her while helping Philip Morrell's political campaign in 1909. In 1911, disenchanted by his first wife, Alys Pearsall Smith, Russell turned to Ottoline and was, for a time, inspired by her, although he could not sympathize with her Christian beliefs. Their relationship was fought over and celebrated in a remarkable correspondence, often amounting to four letters a day. Ottoline's sexual coldness and Russell's possessiveness caused difficulties which prompted suicide threats on both sides; Philip Morrell, engaged in his own busy extramarital love life, was able to take a fairly detached view of the situation.<h2>
<a name="Garsington"></a>Garsington</h2>Ottoline's relationship with Russell had already begun to wane in 1915, when she and Philip moved to their most celebrated home, Garsington Manor in Oxfordshire. The house and the making of its colourful Italianate garden became Ottoline's recreation, while Philip Morrell used his considerable architectural skill to improve the layout of the lower floors of the house and to embellish the exterior with a loggia. Here, as the Morrells provided a refuge for conscientious objectors during the war years, the low, dark rooms were decorated by visitors, though always to Ottoline's taste. The conversations and daily life of Garsington were recorded, sometimes with the malice of unease (Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington, Clive and Vanessa Bell), sometimes with amusement (Aldous Huxley), and occasionally, with a lyricism which suggests that the house came to represent the passing of a lost world of elegance and civilization which would not easily be recovered (Juliette Baillot, D. H. Lawrence, Siegfried Sassoon). Garsington and its hostess featured in the work of contemporary novelists, with Bertrand Russell often in a leading role. Huxley and Lawrence were among those who drew on Ottoline's unconventional country court for their fictions. Her manner, her beliefs, and her appearance were exhibited and parodied, a form of betrayal which hurt her less than the revelation (the truth being exposed to her by Mark Gertler) that she was despised and disliked by many of the people to whom she had given her support. &#145;I am known as a dangerous and designing woman, immoral and unclean&#146;  (Seymour, 397), she wrote in her private journal (January 1918) after this distressing conversation.<br>
<br>Affection mattered to Ottoline too much for her own happiness. (One of her many doctors, a Dr Combe, told Bertrand Russell in confidence in 1912 that her <i>nervosit&eacute;</i> was the only illness he had no hope of curing.) Constantly betrayed by her husband and let down by Russell, she found unexpected comfort in a late relationship with Lionel Gomme, a young bisexual stonemason who died, tragically, of a brain haemorrhage in 1922.<br>
<br>In 1927 Ottoline began writing the memoirs which were published, following some manipulative editing by her husband and, to a lesser extent, by her literary executor, Robert Gathorne-Hardy, after her death. Financial difficulties led to the sale of Garsington in 1928. Ottoline's last ten years were spent with Philip at a modest London home, 10 Gower Street, which survives as part of London University. There, while she became increasingly deaf and troubled by illness, she continued to entertain a remarkable circle of people including W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and the Huxley brothers. Dame Ethel Smyth was a new friend, but many of those who had mocked her in the past, like Virginia Woolf, returned now to honour Ottoline's courage in adversity. Philip's peculiarities and his philandering had become common knowledge; Ottoline herself still hungered for relationships of spiritual affinity. Charlotte Mew, Dilys Powell, and Elizabeth Bowen were among the many intelligent younger women she sought out in the hope, sometimes rewarded, of forming a substantial friendship. A whole generation of young men became the willing and occasionally disrespectful court to this intense, demanding, and unpredictable old lady. Reconciled with D. H. Lawrence shortly before his death, she was touched to be told that there was none other like her: &#145;there is only one Ottoline&#146;  (Seymour, 362). Frieda Lawrence also came to Gower Street for a reconciliation before leaving for New Mexico.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>T. S. Eliot, her regular companion to the music-halls which they both enjoyed, helped Virginia Woolf to draft a memorial tablet after Ottoline's death in 1938. Hinting at her rejection by Philip, its last lines honoured<blockquote>
<div>A brave spirit, unbroken<br>
</div>
<div>Delighting in beauty and goodness<br>
</div>
<div>And the love of her friends.<br>
</div> (Seymour, 361)</blockquote>Eliot's own gratitude was partly inspired by Ottoline's unfailing consideration for his wife, Vivien, at a time when her troubled mental state had cut her off from many of their friends.<br>
<br>Ottoline's flaws remain more immediately apparent than her virtues. She was a demanding and oppressive mother, she could be tyrannical in her desire to control the lives of her friends, and she was reckless in her gossip about other people's private opinions. Her craving for affection could seem discomforting. Her clothes, acknowledged now as pioneering in their imaginative presentation, often provoked mockery and even disgust. One young visitor to Garsington never forgot the horror of seeing her hostess's skirts, a mass of net under which flies swarmed and pressed, as Ottoline stooped to embrace her.<br>
<br>Yet Ottoline Morrell's merits were outstanding. Courageous in her friendships, in her readiness to stand by her beliefs and to support work in which she had faith, she was a trailblazer in fashion, the bohemian ancestor of all that is most adventurous in modern design. As a friend, she was matchless. Henry Yorke (the novelist Henry Green) spoke for many when he wrote to Philip after her death that she had been someone who did good:<blockquote>to literally hundreds of young men like myself who were not worth her little finger, but she took trouble over them and they went out into the world very different from what they would have been if they had not known her. (Seymour, 556)</blockquote>This was Ottoline's greatest gift, the ability to inspire and encourage, to create the idea of an achievable good. &#145;It is very difficult to think of anyone who meant so much to me&#146;  (ibid., 518) wrote T. S. Eliot. Aldous Huxley remembered that she had given him a &#145;complete mental reorientation&#146;  (ibid., 12); Lord David Cecil romantically hailed &#145;a princess of the Renaissance risen to shame our drab age&#146;  (ibid.). Duncan Grant honoured her singular moral and physical courage  (ibid.). Augustus John paid tribute to her &#145;most noble and generous soul &hellip; there is no one to be compared to her&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Laid low by a mysterious illness, Ottoline Morrell received treatment at Sherwood Park, a clinic in Tunbridge Wells run by Dr A. J. Cameron. She died there on 21 April 1938 after being injected with Prontosil, an untested new drug about which there were serious misgivings in the medical world. Cameron, a doctor who freely encouraged the drug's injection at his clinic, had committed suicide on 19 April, possibly after realizing the irresponsibility of his actions. His records were subsequently destroyed. His former patient was buried with her Bentinck relatives on the Welbeck estate. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 26 April. Her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> was written by Virginia Woolf.<br>
<br>Philip Morrell died five years later, in 1943. Their daughter, Julian, who had married Victor Goodman in 1928, returned to her earlier love, Igor Vinogradoff, after her mother's death. She had two sons and a daughter from her first marriage. She met her illegitimate half-brothers for the first time at the funeral for Philip Morrell.<br>
