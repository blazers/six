<span class="headword">Aves, Dame  Geraldine Maitland</span>  (1898&#150;1986), <span class="occ">civil servant and social reformer</span>, was born on 22 August 1898 at Jay's Hatch, a gamekeeper's cottage in a wood near the village of Bovenden, Hertfordshire, because her mother wanted her first child to be born in the depths of the country. She was the elder daughter (there were no sons) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47803/', "Ernest Harry Aves (1857&#150;1917)")</script>, social investigator (and collaborator of Charles Booth), who later, as an expert on minimum wage rates and working conditions, became first chairman of the trades boards set up in 1909. His wife, Eva Mary, was the youngest of the six children of Frederick Maitland, of the East India Company, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56477/', "Emma Knox Maitland, n&#233;e Rees")</script>, who was herself a remarkable woman and, until her death in 1923, an important figure in Geraldine's youth. A suffragist, Emma Knox Maitland was one of the first women members (elected 1894) of the London school board. Geraldine and her sister attended Frognal, a small private school in Hampstead, London. In April 1917 their father unexpectedly died. It was a blow that Geraldine Aves described, even in old age, as &#145;the worst of my life&#146;.<br>
<br>Geraldine Aves went to Newnham College, Cambridge (1917&#150;20), and graduated third class in both parts of the economics tripos (1919 and 1920). While at Cambridge she became president of the Women's University Settlement Society and this helped her to decide that &#145;doing something with and for people was how I should spend my days&#146;. She was appointed in early 1924 as a &#145;temporary assistant organizer&#146; in the care committee service of the London county council's education department. By 1938, under the threat of the Second World War, she was engaged at county hall in the complex plans for the evacuation of London schoolchildren. In 1941 she was seconded to the Ministry of Health as chief welfare officer responsible for the general co-ordination of evacuation and wartime welfare services, including the recruitment of social workers. Drawn into the plans for post-war reconstruction, in June 1945 she served as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's chief child-care consultant in Europe, returning to the ministry in 1946 to become the established head of a permanent welfare division, where, apart from undertaking various short-term assignments to the United Nations, she remained until retiring in 1963. She played a key part in developing the post-war reforms in welfare services, the subsequent development of personal social services, and social work training.<br>
<br>Geraldine Aves's retirement from the Ministry of Health was the beginning of a second career in the voluntary sector. She was fully occupied in promoting, enabling, and chairing (at which she excelled) numerous projects and organizations that were eager for her support. She served on the National Institute of Social Work Training (board of governors, 1961&#150;71), the Council for Training in Social Work (member, 1962&#150;72), the London diocesan synod and bishop's council (member, 1971&#150;9), the London diocesan board for social responsibility (vice-chair, 1979&#150;84), the National Corporation for the Care of Old People (vice-president, 1981&#150;4), the North London Hospice (founder president, 1986), the Harington scheme (a horticultural training scheme for young people with learning difficulties, of which she became chair in 1980 and later vice-president in 1984), and many other organizations. Among the achievements in which she took most pride in this second career was that of chairing the independent committee of inquiry into the place of and scope for voluntary workers in the social services, which was set up in 1966. Following vigorous campaigning under her leadership, the committee's report, <span class="italic">The Voluntary Worker in the Social Services</span> (1969), led to the creation of the Volunteer Centre (later the National Centre for Volunteering), a national organization which aimed to promote and encourage volunteering at all levels and in all spheres of society. She became a founder member of its board of governors and, from 1974, vice-president. It was this work that led to her appointment as DBE in 1977&#151;an honour she had long coveted and, rightly, felt she deserved. She had been appointed OBE in 1946 for her contribution to wartime social services, and CBE in 1963. All through her working life she maintained close links with Newnham College. In 1956 she was elected associate, in 1962 associate fellow, and in 1981 honorary fellow.<br>
<br>Geraldine Aves was one of that band of educated single women who, following the First World War, looked for personal fulfilment in a professional career. She found it in a lifetime devoted to the common good. A handsome woman, of regal appearance, she charmed many and overawed&#151;on occasion bullied&#151;some others, though her authoritarian manner softened in later years. From the age of thirty-four, when she was baptized, her Christian faith meant a great deal to her. She never married, but enjoyed a rich private life of travels and companionship with close friends and relatives. It was while visiting, in Swanage, Dorset, a former colleague, Sibyl Clement Brown (who in 1927 became Britain's first qualified psychiatric social worker), that she was taken ill. She entered a nursing home, and died on 23 June 1986.<br>
