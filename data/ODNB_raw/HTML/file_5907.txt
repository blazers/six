<span class="headword">Colles,  Abraham</span>  (1773&#150;1843), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 23 August 1773 at Milmount, near Kilkenny, Ireland, the second son of William Colles (1745&#150;1779), a quarry owner, and Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1840), daughter of Abraham Bates, of co. Wexford. At some point during the time of his education, in Kilkenny grammar school, a flood swept away part of the house of a local physician, Dr Butler, and carried a work on anatomy into a field near Colles's home. The boy picked it up and returned it to the doctor, who then gave him the book, and this, it is said, led to Colles's choice of medicine as a profession. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in September 1790, and eleven days later was apprenticed to Philip Woodroffe, resident surgeon in Dr Steevens' Hospital. In spite of showing early literary promise he refused to give up medicine, even though Edmund Burke, a family acquaintance, recommended that Colles publish his writings entitled &#145;Remarks on the condition of political satire&#146;. When Colles's uncle talked of the name he was sacrificing, the youth replied: &#145;A name, sir! Yes, as an author, and then not a dowager in Dublin would call me in to cure a sore throat&#146;  (Fallon, 30).<br>
<br>Having graduated BA in February 1795, and obtained the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in the same year, Colles studied at Edinburgh for two sessions, and graduated MD in 1797 with a thesis, &#145;De venaesectione&#146;. He next went to London, where he stayed for some time, assisting Astley Cooper in the dissections for his work on hernia, and attending the London hospitals. In 1797 Colles returned to Dublin with little means and no connections to assist him. At first he practised medicine and was appointed visiting physician to the Meath Dispensary. He also became an active district visitor for the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers' Society, a charitable gesture that brought him to the attention of a number of members of his profession. In 1799 he gave up being a physician on receiving the appointment of resident surgeon to Dr Steevens' Hospital. This he held until 1813, when he became visiting surgeon to the same hospital.<br>
<br>Colles quickly became a masterly surgeon, being cool, dexterous, and resourceful. A number of his operations were significant advances. When he first tied the subclavian artery for aneurysm, the operation had been attempted only twice in England, and never in Ireland. He was the first man in Europe successfully to tie the innominate artery. In his <span class="italic">Treatise on Surgical Anatomy</span> (1811) he discussed the forms of hernia and various important surgical operations in a manner which showed his deep and accurate study developed over many years of daily dissections. His name is, however, best-known in connection with the Colles fracture of the radius, a common fracture just above the wrist and usually the result of a fall on the palm of the hand; despite its frequency this had escaped the notice of previous surgeons. His paper on the subject appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, in 1814.<br>
<br>Colles was also influential in introducing new principles for the use of mercury in the cure of syphilis, replacing the high dosages, which practitioners following John Hunter's example used, with a more cautious approach that helped to revive the flagging reputation of the treatment among surgeons. Through this Colles came into a long conflict with Richard Carmichael, a fellow Irish surgeon, whose experience in the Peninsular War had made him cynical about the effectiveness of mercury.<br>
<br>As surgeon of Dr Steevens' Hospital, Colles had quickly begun clinical and surgical teaching. In 1802 he failed to win the chair of anatomy and surgery at Trinity College. He then unsuccessfully challenged the election in law, and never after had anything to do with that institution. He immediately became active in the Medico-Chirurgical Society, and was soon its president, and in the following year he was appointed surgeon to Cork Street Fever Hospital. In 1804, however, he became professor of anatomy and surgery in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, an office he held for thirty-two years.<br>
<br>Colles's ability as a lecturer greatly extended the reputation of the college and of the Dublin medical school, with the number of students rising from 60 on his arrival to about 1000 by 1836. On his retirement the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland voted on an address stating that he &#145;had been the principal cause of the success and consequent high character of the school of surgery in this country&#146;  (McDonnell, 2). In his lectures Colles was always careful to prevent the influence of preconceived theories on his own and his pupils' judgement. His lectures were published in 1844 in the <span class="italic">Dublin Medical Press</span>, and separately in two volumes, from notes by Simon McCoy; for many years they were among the most easily comprehended and practical extant.<br>
<br>Colles's practice, both as physician and surgeon, was very remunerative, for many years exceeding &pound;5000 per annum. He remained surgeon to Dr Steevens' Hospital until 1841. He was twice president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, in 1802 at only twenty-eight years old, and again in 1830, and he was offered a baronetcy in 1839, but declined it. In 1807 he married Sophia, daughter of the Revd Jonathan Cope, rector of Ahascragh; they had a large family. In the same year he took a house in St Stephen's Green, Dublin, and he lived in the same square for the rest of his life. Colles died on 16 November 1843 and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery. A son, William Colles, became regius professor of surgery in Dublin University and was also president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1863&#150;4.<br>
<br>Though somewhat lacking in imagination, Colles had great perspicuity and possessed the skill of recognizing the salient points of any matter. Cautious in criticism, he expressed simple ideas in clear language. He was cheerful, generous, and modest, a liberal in politics, and a protestant in religion, despising fanaticism and charlatanism. He was never shy of frankly admitting his mistakes. On one occasion at a post-mortem examination of a patient on whom he had operated for stricture of the rectum, he turned to the class and said, &#145;Gentlemen, it is no use mincing the matter; I caused the patient's death&#146;  (McDonnell, 15). Colles was of medium build, well-proportioned, and of dignified manner, with a shrewd, clear eye, a fine forehead, and a decided mouth.<br>
