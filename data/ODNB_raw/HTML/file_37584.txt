<span class="headword">Hurter,  Ferdinand</span>  (1844&#150;1898), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 15 March 1844 in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, the only son of the two children of Tobias Hurter, bookbinder, and his wife, Anna Oechslein. He went to the <i>Gymnasium</i> at Schaffhausen, and then, after apprenticeship with a dyer in Winterthur, he moved to Z&uuml;rich to work with a silk firm. He attended the Z&uuml;rich Polytechnic under G. Staedler, and then studied at Heidelberg University under R. W. Bunsen. He graduated PhD (<i>summa cum laude</i>) at the age of twenty-one.<br>
<br>Hurter refused a professorship in Switzerland and went instead to Manchester, armed only with a few letters of introduction. In 1867 he joined Deacon and Gaskill, alkali manufacturers at Widnes. He became chief chemist, and with Henry Deacon developed the process by which the by-product, hydrochloric acid, was converted to marketable chlorine and bleaching powder&#151;an important contribution to the survival of the Leblanc soda process.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1871 Hurter married Hannah, daughter of R. Garnett of Farnworth; they had six children. Hurter was a pioneer in applying the disciplines of physical chemistry and thermodynamics to industrial processes. By 1880 he was recognized as an international authority on alkali manufacture. Competition from the more cost-effective ammonia-soda process forced the many Leblanc soda manufacturers to combine, and in 1891 the United Alkali Company was formed, with Hurter in charge of its research centre at Widnes. Soon afterwards he was asked to assess a new process, the production of caustic soda and chlorine by the electrolysis of brine. At a time when his health was failing, Hurter's judgement was affected by emotional loyalty to the Leblanc process, to which he had made such valuable contributions in the past, and following his advice, the company made a disastrous decision to decline the investment opportunity.<br>
<br>Hurter collaborated with Vero Driffield, an engineer, in research into photography; they published many papers and were awarded the progress medal of the Royal Photographic Society in 1895.<br>
<br>Hurter, who remained a Swiss citizen, was a sociable man, loved music, and played the clarinet and piano. He campaigned for free education, and for the introduction into Britain of the metric system. He was active in founding the Society of Chemical Industry, and read an important paper at the first meeting of the Liverpool section in 1881; he was its chairman in 1889&#150;91. He died at his home, Holly Lodge, Cressington Park, Liverpool, on 12 March 1898 and was buried at Farnworth churchyard. The Hurter Laboratory of the United Alkali Company of Widnes was named in his memory, and the Society of Chemical Industry endowed the triennial Hurter memorial lecture.<br>
