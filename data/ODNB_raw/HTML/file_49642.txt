<div class="para">
<span class="headword">FitzGibbon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rosling; <em>other married name </em>Morrison]</span>,  Theodora</span>  (1916&#150;1991), <span class="occ">writer on cookery</span>, was born on 21 October 1916, the only legitimate daughter of John Archibald Rosling (known as Adam) and his wife, Alice Winifred Hodgkins. A great many myths surrounded her life and background: she once told an interviewer that she was born at Southampton, her mother having narrowly avoided giving birth on the boat from Ireland, but she was in fact born at 28 St James Road, Bethnal Green, London, where her maternal grandmother, who was present at her birth, had founded a slum clinic at the turn of the century. In her autobiography <span class="italic">With Love</span> (1982)&#151;which covers the years 1938&#150;46 and contains a superlative account of living in Chelsea during the blitz&#151;she says she was brought up by her grandmother, and that her mother worked at the clinic for over twenty years. Some sources give her father's occupation as veterinary surgeon, but her birth certificate describes him as &#145;petty officer, Royal Naval Air Service (motor engineer)&#146;, and at the time of her first marriage he was stated merely to be &#145;of independent means&#146;. Her own name appears in a variety of forms: on her birth certificate she was Joan Eileen, on her first marriage she was Joanne Eileen Winifred, on her second she was Joanna Eileen Theodora, and at her death she was simply Theodora, the name by which she had been known for most of her life. (As an actress, she had used the name Karen Petersen.)<br>
<br>None of this would surprise her readers. Reminding them &#145;how close to the truth are the stories of Somerville and Ross&#146;, she instanced her own great-great-uncle, who, she claimed, &#145;coined his own money in Cloughjordan, King's county, in the 1870s and always used it. As children we would play with some of the coins&#146;  (<span class="italic">With Love</span>, 23). Theodora was educated in a number of convents, including St Joseph's, Hendon, and the Sacr&eacute; Coeur in Bruges (and was expelled from one for betting on horses), as well as at home. She travelled widely with her exigent father&#151;once when served <i>sole V&eacute;ronique</i> in an incorrect sauce he threw it on the floor of the restaurant&#151;eating her way around Europe, the Middle East, and parts of India (where she learned how to make the masala for a curry from scratch). It may have been at a finishing school near Paris that the former Queen Natalie of Serbia gave her cooking lessons.<br>
<br>When Theodora was eighteen, her father gave her &pound;1000 and left her to make her own way. She went on the stage in repertory in Coventry and Birmingham, and then joined a touring company, the English Players, in the French provinces. She later had several parts on the West End stage, modelled for a fashionable couturier, and appeared in films, including Anthony Asquith's <span class="italic">Freedom Radio</span> (1941). In Paris for a fortnight in 1938, she met the successful photographer (and less successful surrealist painter) Peter Rose Pulham (1910&#150;1956) and began an affair. Through him she met Balthus, Cocteau, Dal&iacute;, and Picasso in Paris, and then in London, after a dramatic escape from France by bicycle and boat from Bordeaux, she worked for a time for the Free French, befriended the poet Brian Howard, stayed at Rosa Lewis's Cavendish Hotel, and consorted with both the frogman Commander Crabbe and the Soviet spy Donald Maclean. At the one-room Colony Club, the Horseshoe, and the Mandrake, she and Pulham drank with the young painters John Banting, John Minton, Lucian Freud, and Francis Bacon.<br>
<br>The affair with Pulham ended in 1943, after Theodora had met the Irish-American writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31110/', "(Robert Louis) Constantine Lee-Dillon FitzGibbon (1919&#150;1983)")</script>. In his amiable farewell note, Pulham declared his liking for &#145;dirty black-haired women&#146;  (<span class="italic">With Love</span>, 150): Theodora was a fastidious natural blonde, whose long arms had been admired by Picasso. After the divorce from his first wife was finalized, FitzGibbon and Theodora were married, at Chelsea register office on 21 March 1944. Dylan Thomas was to have been one of the witnesses, but arrived too late for the ceremony: he wrote a version of &#145;At last, in a wrong rain&#146; for their wedding anniversary. The marriage lasted fifteen years, and was often stormy. It ended in divorce in 1959, when Theodora found FitzGibbon in bed with one of her house guests. The following day they complimented her on the <i>b&#339;uf &agrave; la mode</i> she had left in the kitchen.<br>
<br>Theodora FitzGibbon began her career as a cookery writer in 1952. Having been obliged to feed her husband and friends during the war and rationing on horse-liver p&acirc;t&eacute;, whale meat, and rook pie, she was commissioned to write a cookery book, <span class="italic">Cosmopolitan Cookery in an English Kitchen</span>. She welcomed the opportunity to return to more conventional foodstuffs, and showed an understandable preference for rich ingredients. More than twenty-five further cookery books appeared. A series of <span class="italic">A Taste of &hellip;</span> books examined different regional specialities mainly from the British Isles, including <span class="italic">A Taste of Ireland</span> (1968) (which startles the squeamish reader with a recipe for drisheen, a dish of pig's blood and cream), but were not merely recipe books: she had a talent for acquiring arcane knowledge about the history, sociology, and geography of food, which she shared with her readers. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in her encyclopaedic <span class="italic">The Food of the Western World</span> (1976), for which she gathered material for fifteen years. Lest the reader think her recipes were overwhelmingly based on the subsequently unpopular offal and dairy produce, <span class="italic">Eat Well and Live Longer</span> (1968) collected recipes without the use of animal fats. In 1956 she began a cookery column in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, and for twenty years she contributed a column to the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>.<br>
<br>Theodora remained on friendly terms with FitzGibbon after their divorce, despite her own second marriage, on 17 September 1960, to George Edward Morrison (<i>b</i>. 1922), a film-maker and film archivist, and lived in Dalkey, co. Dublin. In this marriage she found domestic equilibrium and happiness, and in many ways the move to Ireland was a return to her roots: she maintained: &#145;I have never understood the English, nor they me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 March 1991). Her novel, <span class="italic">The Flight of the Kingfisher</span> (1967), was made into a successful television play, but she did no further work in that form. Her two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">With Love</span> (1982) and <span class="italic">Love Lies a Loss</span> (1985), were her last books. Theodora FitzGibbon died on 25 March 1991 in St Columcilles Hospital, Killiney, co. Dublin, having outlived most of the rackety, bohemian companions of her youth.<br>
