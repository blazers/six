<span class="headword">Taylor,  Hugh</span>  (1789&#150;1868), <span class="occ">land agent and estate commissioner</span>, was born on 22 November 1789 at Shilbottle Lodge, Newburn, Northumberland, the fourth, but third surviving, son of Thomas Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1810) of Newburn, farmer and mineral agent to Hugh Percy, duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Mary Nixon. His father established the Taylor family interest in the north-eastern coal trade, and looked to his three sons to consolidate this. The eldest son, Thomas Taylor, of Whitehill Point and later of Cramlington, Northumberland, became a leading coal owner in the newly opened and fast-expanding Tyne basin or eastern coal district on the north bank of the lower Tyne, where best-quality Wallsend house coal was found at great depth. The second son, John Taylor, of Shilbottle, became a noted mining engineer, and Hugh Taylor himself was apprenticed to a colliery owner to learn the art of winning and working coal in the deep.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1810 Hugh Taylor, though no more than twenty-one years old, succeeded him as mineral agent to the second duke of Northumberland. Under the third duke, who succeeded in 1817, he quickly advanced to a more senior position in the ducal administration. At that time the Percy estates were managed by three commissioners, each of whom managed a separate territorial district, and under each commissioner were a number of bailiffs, who held farms at low rents in return for looking after a number of fellow tenants. Taylor was promoted to one of these commissionerships, while retaining the colliery agency. Experience made him highly critical of this system of divided managerial responsibilities, which tended to upset the tenantry because policies and practices varied from one commissioner's district to another; but the third duke disliked the idea of change. On his death in 1847 Taylor persuaded the fourth duke to make a clean sweep of the whole system, and a reformed and hierarchical management structure was set up, with himself as chief commissioner. He was entrusted with sole and undivided authority over all the Northumberland estates and controlled a staff of salaried agents for territorial subdistricts and specialized functions such as colliery matters, building works, and land drainage. This centralized and authoritarian regime for managing a vast estate&#151;over 180,000 acres in Northumberland&#151;may well have owed much to the example of James Loch's administration of the Sutherland estates, which undoubtedly would have been known to Taylor.<br>
<br>The fourth duke, known as Algernon the Good and Algernon the Benevolent, was resolved to spend his large income liberally, but it was Taylor who acted as the channel for the duke's munificence. Much of the expenditure which he supervised was of a benevolent or philanthropic character: national schools were supported, churches were built, fishing villages were provided with barometers, and, with the example of Grace Darling on the doorstep, lifeboats were placed along the coast. Most of the expenditure, however, was designed to promote the prosperity of the estate and was to the mutual advantage of the duke and his tenantry. The agricultural expenditure was immense&#151;&pound;0.5 million on field drainage and farm buildings between 1847 and 1865&#151;and the estate was in the van in trying out steam ploughing and town sewage irrigation. By the 1860s it had the reputation of being one of the best-run estates in the country, much visited by agricultural tourists. But it was in industrial affairs that Taylor excelled, and his most important services to the Percy fortunes were in the protection and promotion of the duke's colliery and wayleave interests in the manor of Tynemouth; he had a major role in securing the establishment of the Tyne commissioners and the building of the Northumberland Dock. He was himself a colliery owner at Earsdon in the manor of Tynemouth, where he purchased a farm in 1824 and built himself a house, paying both royalty and wayleave rents to the duke, but apparently feeling no conflict of interests. He was a respected authority on the coal trade, an important witness before the 1829 select committee of the House of Lords on the coal trade, and for many years chairman of the Coal Trade Association of Northumberland and Durham.<br>
<br>Hugh Taylor was much helped in colliery matters by his nephew, <a name="cosubject_50699"></a><span class="headword">Thomas John Taylor</span>  (1810&#150;1861), eldest of the four sons of John Taylor of Shilbottle, the <span class="occ">mining engineer</span>, and his wife, Margaret Darling of Ford, Northumberland. Thomas John was educated at Ponteland School and Edinburgh University, and he then trained as a colliery viewer and soon became manager of Haswell colliery, in which his uncle Hugh was a partner. In 1847 he was appointed colliery agent to the fourth duke of Northumberland, and with the professional support of John Buddle, the leading colliery viewer of the previous generation, he rose to eminence as a mining engineer and was one of the founders of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers in 1852, and its first vice-president. He was one of the expert witnesses consulted by the select committee on the rating of mines in 1857. He devised a scheme for rescuing the sixteen to eighteen waterlogged collieries of the Tyne basin, on both banks of the river, which had been abandoned through flooding, leaving the seams below the High Main unwrought; however, the common drainage company which he suggested was only set up after his death. He investigated the behaviour of tidal rivers and estuaries, and in 1851 published a pamphlet on the improvement of the River Tyne, which enunciated the principles on which the improvement of several other tidal harbours was based. He was involved in the planning and construction of the Border Counties Railway, farther up the north Tyne from Hexham, which was intended originally to open out a small field of inferior coal at Plashetts but which became a pawn in high-level railway politics as a key section of the &#145;Waverley route&#146; to Edinburgh avoiding use of both north British and North Eastern rails. In 1839 he married his first cousin Eliza Taylor, who died in 1840, presumably in giving birth to their only child, Eliza Anne. Thomas John Taylor died on 2 April 1861 while preparing for a meeting of Border Counties directors, at Bellingham, on the north Tyne. His youngest brother, John Taylor (1820&#150;1879), of Earsdon, was also a leading mining engineer, specializing in the lead mines of Northumberland and Durham, while his second brother, Charles Taylor (1812&#150;1856), of Sunderland, was also in the coal trade. The most successful of all the family, in worldly terms, was his third brother, another Hugh Taylor (1817&#150;1900), coal owner and partner in several collieries in Durham as well as in Northumberland, MP for Tynemouth (1852&#150;4 and 1859&#150;61), who purchased Chipchase Castle and its estate, on the north Tyne, in 1862, from another coal owner, R. W. Grey, and there established a landed family.<br>
<br>Hugh Taylor senior purchased a second farm in Earsdon in 1852 to add to the one he had bought in 1824, and when the duke's business did not keep him in Alnwick Castle he lived in Earsdon and was much attached to the village. He never married, and on his death on 30 August 1868 at Earsdon he left &pound;1600 to endow a charity&#151;one third of the income to go to the aged poor of Earsdon, and the rest to the local voluntary school; his land went to his nephew John Taylor for life, and then to another nephew, Hugh Taylor, rector of Wark, Northumberland.<br>
