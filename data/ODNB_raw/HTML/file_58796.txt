<span class="headword">Erskine <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Chiesley, Cheislie]</span>,  Rachel</span>, Lady Grange  (<em>bap. </em>1679, <em>d.</em> 1745), <span class="occ">victim of abduction</span>, was the daughter of John Cheislie (<i>d</i>. 1689) of Dalry and Margaret Nicholson; she was baptized on 4 February 1679 at Edinburgh. On 31 March 1689 her father shot dead Sir George Lockhart, lord president of the court of session, in revenge for a decision in favour of his wife's alimony claim. After torture by the boots he was executed and hung in chains. Probably in 1707 Rachel, who was accounted a great beauty, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8861/', "James Erskine (bap. 1679, d. 1754)")</script>, a lord of session from 1706 with the title of Lord Grange; consequently Rachel assumed the title of Lady Grange. The couple lived at the foot of Niddry's Wynd, off the High Street in Edinburgh, and had four sons and four daughters. Rachel was noted for her violent temper and ungovernable rages. The marriage was deeply unhappy; it is claimed that James had debauched her and that she forced him into marriage by threatening his life. By 1730 the marriage was over, owing to James's long absences in London as a sitting MP, but also to his affairs, in particular a long-standing relationship with Fanny Lindsay, a Scottish coffee-house keeper in the Haymarket. James decided to move his family out of Edinburgh and gave Rachel an allowance of &pound;100, but she took to standing beneath his window in Niddry's Wynd, shouting obscenities. She then moved back into Edinburgh, after being denied contact with her children, and continued to harass her husband. She had become a social embarrassment; then, more seriously, she threatened to disclose her husband's involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1715. James's elder brother, the sixth earl of Mar, had led the abortive uprising and Rachel, who claimed to have evidence implicating James, was known to have Hanoverian sympathies.<br>
<br>Lord Grange had already been involved, in 1728, in the forcible abduction of his sister-in-law Lady Mar (Mary Wortley Montagu's sister), who suffered from mental illness; he now planned to remove the threat posed by his wife in a similar fashion. On this occasion he enlisted the help of fellow Jacobites Lord Lovat and Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan. At 11 p.m. on 22 April 1732, after a violent struggle, Rachel was kidnapped from her lodgings in Edinburgh and taken, bound, blindfold, and gagged, on horseback to Linlithgow. She was then moved to Polmaise, Stirlingshire and held there for four months. After being moved through the highlands in great discomfort she was finally placed on the island of Hesker, off North Uist, where she remained for two years. By May 1734 Sir Alexander MacDonald could no longer afford to keep her and she was sent to the remote island group of St Kilda, 42 miles off Uist. There she was held incommunicado, in very primitive conditions and among Gaelic speakers, on the island of Hirta from 1734 to 1742. Meanwhile James announced her death in Edinburgh and held a mock funeral.<br>
<br>Rachel eventually smuggled out a message to her cousin, the lord advocate, in a ball of wool carried by the daughter of St Kilda's minister. Her cousin sent a gunboat for her but before help could arrive Norman MacLeod had her moved to Assynt in Sutherland, and finally to Skye, where all real pretence of looking after her ended and she was reputedly abandoned to live in a local cavern.<br>
<br>Rachel became a romantic figure for later writers. Samuel Johnson mentioned her tale in his <span class="italic">Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland</span>, and Walter Scott's coadjutor, William Erskine, wrote a romantic poem, <span class="italic">Epistle from Lady Grange to Edward D&#151;</span>, in which she is portrayed as being sold into a loveless marriage with an older man; the poem suggests she had a younger lover from whom she was parted when sent to St Kilda. In 1897 Alexander Innes Shand wrote a romance, <span class="italic">The Lady Grange</span>, in which a young couple, Jessie and Malcolm, help Rachel escape from St Kilda and then confront James in Edinburgh. James repents of his actions but Lovat gets wind of this and has Rachel poisoned. Grange helps Jessie and Malcolm emigrate to Virginia before himself dying in penury. In fact Rachel died, at Idrigal on Skye, in May 1745 and was buried at Trumpan on Skye's Waternish peninsula.<br>
