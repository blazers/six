<span class="headword">Silver,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1580&#150;1599), <span class="occ">swordsman and writer on fencing</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Silver of Ropley, Hampshire, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Thomas West, one of the ramified West family of Sussex and Hampshire, of whom the barons De La Warr were the chief representatives. Nothing is known of his early life, but Silver was probably ordinarily resident in London by early 1580. On 24 March of that year he married in St Clement Danes, Mary Heydon, a spinster of the city of London whose father, George Heydon of Norwich, was the son of Sir John Heydon of Baconsthorpe, Norfolk. It is not known where or how George Silver acquired his mastery of fencing. There was in London a society of swordsmen known as the &#145;masters of defence&#146;, originally chartered as a corporation by Henry VIII, but Silver was not a member; he thought these men were worthy, but lacked the finest skills.<br>
<br>Silver's book <span class="italic">Paradoxes of Defence</span> was entered in the register of the Stationers' Company on 30 January 1599. In it Silver recalled two Italians, Ieronimo, an apprentice, and Vincentio, a master identifiable as Vincentio Saviolo, who had for seven or eight years earned a living in England teaching the technique of the rapier to gentlemen:<blockquote>These two Italian fencers, especially Vincentio, said that Englishmen were strong men, but had no cunning, and they would go back too much in their fight, which was great disgrace unto them. Upon these words, my brother Toby Silver and myself made challenge of them both, to play with them at single rapier, rapier and dagger, the single dagger, the single sword, the sword and target, the sword and buckler, and two hand sword, the staff, battle axe and morris pike, to be played at the Bel Savage upon the scaffold, where he that went in his fight faster back than he ought, of Englishman or Italian, should be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold. (<span class="italic">Paradoxes</span>, 66)</blockquote>Such was their confidence, Silver here suggested, that they had consented to fight at the Bel Savage on Ludgate Hill, an inn which also served as a playhouse, even though its small stage would greatly disadvantage those who fought in rapid retreat, as the English were said to. Fencing contests were familiar sights in London, for they were used by the masters of defence as tests whereby students advanced to full membership of their society, and many were held in playhouses as a kind of theatrical entertainment. George and Toby Silver posted &#145;five or six score bills of challenge &hellip; from the Southwark to the Tower, and from thence through London unto Westminster&#146;. When they arrived at the Bel Savage on the appointed day, there were &#145;a multitude of people there to behold the fight&#146;, but the Italians did not appear  (<span class="italic">Paradoxes</span>, 66&#150;7). The credibility of the account is damaged by the author's apparent belief that the virtue of courage was not to be found among men of Italian nationality. His prefatory admonition to Englishmen urges them to reject the influence of foreign teachers, and, &#145;casting off these Italianated, weake, fanatical, and most divellish and imperfect fights&#146; return to their natural style  (ibid., 1). But what was this? Silver's complaint against the Italian teachers was that they &#145;did not teach defence but offence&#146;  (ibid., 77).<br>
<br>For very nearly 300 years Silver's fame rested upon this single published book, yet he also produced a second work, which is in many respects more interesting but which remained in manuscript until its eventual publication in 1898 by Captain C. G. R. Matthey in <span class="italic">The Works of George Silver</span>. This was entitled &#145;Bref instructions upo my paradoxes of defence&#146;, clearly intended as a companion to the published work. It sets out a series of tactical precepts and techniques, which rest upon a distinctive strategic approach: &#145;Silver lays great stress upon defence &hellip; and it is only when in safety that he advises counter-attack or riposte&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, xvi). For Matthey, the manual was of more than academic interest: it could be &#145;put into practice in sword encounters with highly successful results, especially when they take place against men of savage or barbarian races that Her Majesty's troops are now so frequently sent to face in various quarters of the globe&#146;  (ibid., xv). According to a later authority, the work<blockquote>describes an advanced technique of short sword fencing which we would recognise as somewhat similar to nineteenth-century sabre fencing. Silver was teaching a new and radical technique of parrying with the edge of the light short sword, and with this considerable improvement in technique had evolved an early and effective sabre style,</blockquote>suitable not just for duelling but for street fighting and battle  (Jackson, viii). Silver's manual reveals him as an expert technician, whose impatience with his rivals was not merely arrogance or chauvinism.<br>
<br>Nothing more is certainly known about George Silver's life, but his wife, Mary, married a second husband, Edward Edwards of Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, and this may suggest that Silver died young. In 1599 the administration is recorded of the property of a Tobias Silver, who had been killed in Ireland. This was probably the brother, and partner, of whom Silver wrote. <span class="italic">Paradoxes of Defence</span> contained a preface dedicated to Robert, earl of Essex. It may be that the two brothers enlisted together as swordsmen in the earl's expedition to Ireland in 1599, and that George, like Toby, did not return.<br>
