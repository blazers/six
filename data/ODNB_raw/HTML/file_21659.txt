<span class="headword">Payne,  William Henry Schofield</span>  (1803&#150;1878), <span class="occ">actor and pantomimist</span>, was born on 25 June 1803 in the City of London the son of William and Alice Payne and was apprenticed to Isaac Cowen, a stockbroker. When he was in his eighteenth year he ran away, and joined a travelling theatre company on the Warwickshire circuit, and rose to play small parts at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. After returning to London he studied under Joseph Grimaldi and Jack Bologna at Sadler's Wells Theatre, and then obtained an engagement at an East End theatre. In the following year, 1825, he migrated to the Pavilion Theatre, where he remained until 1831, and established a reputation for his hilarious characterization of barons and villains, as well as clowns. He was particularly admired for his skill as a mime artist. At Christmas productions he represented the clown, with Miss Rountree, afterwards his wife, as Columbine. The couple had four children, Harriet Farrell, Annie, Harry (1833&#150;1895), and Frederick (1841&#150;1880), all of whom took to the stage. On 26 December 1831 Payne made his first appearance at Covent Garden Theatre in the pantomime <span class="italic">Hop o' my Thumb and his Brothers</span>, by Charles Farley, in which he played Madoc Mawr, the Welsh ogre. He and his family played at Covent Garden for several decades, and his son Harry merited the distinction of principal clown at the theatre after the death of Richard Flexmore in 1860. In 1832 Payne senior was still more successful in the pantomime <span class="italic">Puss in Boots</span>, in which his character was Tasnar, chief of the Long Heads and No Bodies.<br>
<br>During his long career Payne played many parts, ranging from pantomime to tragedy. He was harlequin to Joe Grimaldi's clown at Sadler's Wells in 1827, he was Dandy Lover to young Joe Grimaldi's clown, and made a capital clown himself. He acted in tragedy with Charles Young, Charles Kemble, James Wallack, and Edmund Kean, and on Kean's last appearance (as Othello, Covent Garden, 25 March 1833), it was Payne, then acting Ludovico, who carried him off the stage when he was unable through illness to finish the part. He also figured prominently in grand ballet with Pauline Leroux, Cerito, Carlotta Grisi, the Elsslers, and other dancers of note, and played in state before George IV, William IV, Victoria, Napoleon III, and the Empress Eug&eacute;nie.<br>
<br>In 1841 Payne was still at Covent Garden, and filled the role of Guy, Earl of Warwick, in the pantomime produced at Christmas. On 31 March 1847 he opened at Vauxhall Gardens in a ballet with his wife and his sister Annie Payne. In 1848 he was engaged by John Knowles for the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and here he remained for seven years, increasing the annual run of the pantomime from its usual 24 nights to 100, and making <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> so attractive that it was given on 125 consecutive nights. After leaving Manchester he appeared with his sons at Sadler's Wells in the pantomime of <span class="italic">The Forty Thieves</span> at Christmas 1854. The Payne family was also frequently seen at the Standard Theatre, the Crystal Palace, and other places. Payne, who was widely regarded by colleagues as a respectable man, died at Calstock House, Beach Street, Dover, on 18 December 1878. A writer in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> said: &#145;The last true mime has departed in the person of W. H. Payne&#146;.<br>
