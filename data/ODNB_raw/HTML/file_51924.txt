<span class="headword">Lisle,  Aubrey Edwin  Orchard-</span>  (1908&#150;1989), <span class="occ">commercial estate agent</span>, was born on 12 March 1908, at Crediton, Devon, the second of four sons of Edwin Orchard-Lisle and his wife, Lucy Ellen Lock. He was educated at West Buckland School, north Devon, and later attended the College of Estate Management in London. He left school at the age of sixteen following the death of his father, and started work with the Hampstead-based estate agents Ernest Owers. He passed the Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Institute examination when he was twenty-one, achieving the highest mark for the London area. In 1926 he moved to Healey and Baker, an old-established surveying firm which was just beginning to move into commercial property. In 1929 he transferred to the firm's new West End office in St George Street, where he managed the development of the practice's commercial side (which was eventually to replace its residential business) together with Arthur Hemens, who had joined Healey and Baker in 1926. In 1930 his brother Mervyn also joined the practice. The two brothers, together with Arthur Hemens and, later, Douglas Tovey, were the guiding forces behind the firm's development as one of Britain's largest and most successful commercial estate agencies.<br>
<br>Early deals with shop developers led Orchard-Lisle to concentrate his activities on the lucrative shops sector. A highly successful strategy was adopted of developing strong links with rapidly expanding multiple retailing chains such as Montague Burton, Marks and Spencer, and Woolworth's. Close relationships with these retailers enabled the practice to gain a key position as the presence of one of the major multiples could determine the success or failure of a development.<br>
<br>Orchard-Lisle was also instrumental in forging links between retailers, property developers, and institutional investors such as the Prudential and Norwich Union. He put together deals which allowed retailers and developers to raise considerable finance on the strength of their property portfolios by selling stores to financial institutions, and simultaneously taking long (99- or 999-year) leases on them at fixed rents. Healey and Baker's success in this field led to rapid expansion; between 1930 and 1939 the number of its employees grew from fifteen to more than a hundred. In 1934 Orchard-Lisle became a partner, and in the same year he married Phyllis Muriel Viall (<i>d</i>. 1981); they had one son.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939 Orchard-Lisle recruited Douglas Tovey, a surveyor who had worked for the Great Western Railway, and the shopping parade developer Edward Lotery; the partnership of Orchard-Lisle and Tovey was to provide the cornerstone of Healey and Baker's success in the post-war property boom. After the war ended they took over the firm's investment and West End business. Orchard-Lisle began to advise large City institutions such as the Prudential and the Pearl insurance companies, helping them to acquire investment property at a time when cheap money and government controls on capital issues greatly reduced the supply of alternative assets. He also advised some of the first pension funds to invest in property, including the National Coal Board's superannuation scheme (to which he was appointed as property consultant in 1953) and the National Bus Company pension fund.<br>
<br>Orchard-Lisle worked with some of the most famous property entrepreneurs of the 1950s, including Jack Cotton, whose main property adviser he became, often setting up entire deals for him. &#145;If Jack Cotton said yes to Aubrey Orchard-Lisle &hellip; [he was] saying yes to a full package which included acquisition, letting and funding&#146;  (Gordon, 31). He and Cotton became close friends; the Orchard-Lisles bought a house in Marlow from one of the Cotton trusts, located across the Thames from Cotton's home.<br>
<br>Orchard-Lisle was known for his single-minded devotion to business. His brother Mervyn recalled a time when they had been invited to lunch at the House of Commons; they were walking through the Great Hall of Westminster when Mervyn paused to stop and said: &#145;You know Aubrey, this is where Warren Hastings was impeached.&#146; Aubrey replied: &#145;No, but by the way you did complete the deal with Montague Burton's at Woolwich?&#146;  (private information). However, while he listed his main recreation in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as work, Orchard-Lisle was also a good all-round sportsman and was particularly keen on cricket. His business activities outside Healey and Baker included serving on the board of the General Practice Finance Corporation, as chairman of the advisory panel for institutional finance in new towns, and as a member of the board of the National Bus Company. He also applied his organizational abilities to the benefit of the National Health Service, as a governor of Guy's Hospital medical school, chairman of the special trustees of Guy's Hospital, and a member of the Lambeth, Southwark, and Lewisham Area Health Authority (teaching). He was a fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and was appointed CBE in 1973.<br>
<br>Orchard-Lisle became a senior partner at Healey and Baker in 1972 and continued to work for the practice as a consultant partner until he was eighty-three. He died on 5 August 1989 from cancer at the London Bridge Hospital, Tooley Street, London.<br>
