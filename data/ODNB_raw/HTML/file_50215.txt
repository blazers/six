<span class="headword">Hay, Lord  John</span>  (1827&#150;1916), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the ninth child and fourth son of George Hay, eighth marquess of Tweeddale (1787&#150;1876) and his wife, Lady Susan Montagu (1797&#150;1870), daughter of the duke of Manchester. He was born in Geneva on 23 August 1827. His namesake uncle significantly furthered his early career. He joined the navy in 1839, and served in the <i>Vestal</i> on the China station from 1842 to 1847, including the final stages of the First Opium War. He was promoted lieutenant on 19 December 1846, and came home in the following year with the steam sloop <i>Spiteful</i>. Between 1848 and 1851 he served in the <i>Powerful</i> (Captain Richard Dundas) in the Mediterranean, and on 28 August 1851 he was promoted commander. He returned to the Mediterranean as commander of the steam screw sloop <i>Wasp</i> in 1852 and remained in her during the Eastern crisis of 1853 and Black Sea campaign of 1854, playing a noteworthy part in the defence of Eupatoria in November.<br>
<br>Hay was made captain on 27 November 1854, by which time he and most of his crew were serving ashore with the naval brigade. He left the command of the <i>Wasp</i> in February 1855, and was wounded on 9 April while serving ashore. He then returned to Britain, and was made a CB on 5 July 1855. In December he was appointed to command the screw mortar frigate <i>Forte</i>, part of the &#145;great armament&#146; assembled for an assault on Kronstadt in early 1856. After participating in the Spithead review of St George's day, which both celebrated the peace and issued a warning to rival powers, he continued in the ship until November that year. After he came ashore he took the parliamentary seat for Wick, but on the return to office of Palmerston in 1859 he was appointed to the paddle frigate <i>Odin</i> for the East Indies and China station. He commanded a division of gunboats during the second capture of the Taku (Dagu) forts in August 1860, and became commodore on the station in 1861, remaining there until 1863.<br>
<br>Having been elected MP for Ripon, a pocket borough controlled by Earl De Grey, in April 1866 Hay joined the Admiralty board, serving out the last three months of Russell's Liberal administration. Defeated at the polls in 1867, he returned to his Ripon seat in 1868 and rejoined the board. His tact and good sense helped to keep naval administration functioning during the turbulent period under Hugh Childers, when the Admiralty board was reduced to a cipher and the senior personnel were engaged in a bitter power struggle. In May 1871, shortly after the resignation of Childers, Hay resigned both his seats and took command of the ironclad <i>Hotspur</i> until his promotion to rear-admiral on 7 May 1872. From 1875 to 1876 he was second in command of the Channel Fleet. During this command he married Annie Christina, daughter of Norman Lambert MP, of Denham Court, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Hay was appointed commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet in November 1877, and was promoted vice-admiral on 21 December 1877. During the strategic redeployment caused by the Russo-Turkish War of 1877&#150;8 and the Russian war scare of 1878 he took three battleships from his fleet to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet. Under the Cyprus convention he took formal possession of the island from the Turkish authorities on 8 July 1879. In 1880 he returned to the Admiralty as second naval lord on Lord Northbrook's board. He resigned in February 1883 to become commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, in the <i>Alexandra</i> (Captain Rawson), where his fleet supplied naval parties to survey the Nile and support the Gordon relief expedition. While in the Mediterranean, Hay tried to draw attention to the weakness of the navy, but was largely ignored until the &#145;truth about the navy&#146; alarm generated by Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby and W. T. Stead in 1884. In February 1885 Hay served as commander of an international fleet blockading Crete, then a Turkish possession, against Greek intervention.<br>
<br>Hay left the Mediterranean command in March 1886, and that year was briefly first naval lord, under his old friend and patron the marquess of Ripon. Between May 1887 and December 1888 Hay served as commander-in-chief at Devonport, and on hauling down his flag he was promoted admiral of the fleet. He was placed on the retired list on 23 August 1897, and died at his home, Fulmer Place, Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, on 4 May 1916; his wife survived him. Hay was one of the last &#145;political&#146; admirals: his family connections and Liberal politics played a vital part in his career, though his service in the Crimea and China justified his promotion. His Admiralty service always coincided with Liberal administrations, as did almost all his seagoing commands. An officer of solid talents, he had a career crowned with a rare distinction, even though he lacked the eminence of his near contemporary Geoffrey Hornby.<br>
