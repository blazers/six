<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  John  Dover</span>  (1881&#150;1969), <span class="occ">literary scholar and educationist</span>, was born at Mortlake, Surrey, on 13 July 1881, the eldest of the six children of Edwin Wilson, engraver and scientific illustrator, and his wife, Elizabeth Dover. He won scholarships to Lancing College, where his uncle was headmaster, and to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took the historical tripos with a second class in each part (1902&#150;3).<br>
<br>In 1904 Dover Wilson won the Harness prize for an essay published as <span class="italic">John Lyly</span> (1905), which brought him to the attention of A. W. Ward, who assigned him two chapters of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span>, and through whom, after a year's teaching at Whitgift Grammar School, Croydon, he became English lektor at Helsingfors (Helsinki) in 1906. In that year he married Dorothy Mary (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of Canon Edward Curtis Baldwin, vicar of Harston, near Cambridge. The couple went on to have one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75514/', "Godfrey Baldwin Wilson (1908&#150;1944)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75515/', "Wilson, Monica")</script>], and three daughters. The political climate in Finland also gave Dover Wilson the opportunity to work as a foreign correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, but in 1909 he relinquished his teaching post to become lecturer in English literature at Goldsmiths' College, London. His Elizabethan researches, especially on the Marprelate tracts, had brought him into the orbit of three scholars closely associated with the &#145;new bibliography&#146;: A. W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, and R. B. McKerrow. With Pollard there developed an intimate friendship which became one of the principal influences in his life.<br>
<br>Alongside scholarly articles (from 1907) and reprints Dover Wilson produced the successful anthology <span class="italic">Life in Shakespeare's England</span> (1911, 1956, 1976). But in 1912 an invitation to become an inspector for the Board of Education meant that for over twenty years literary scholarship had to accommodate itself to the demands of another career. During his first six years as an inspector, while he lived in Leeds and did a perpetual round of evening schools throughout the northern counties, his Arnoldian ideal of culture for industrial workers was strengthened by often gruelling experience. He was involved in the Workers' Educational Association, and wrote a commissioned memorandum on <span class="italic">Humanism in the Continuation School</span> (1921), on which he was warmly congratulated by Albert Mansbridge; and when the scheme for such schools in the 1918 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> was ultimately dropped he felt this a betrayal of the nation's youth. He also served on the committee on the teaching of English set up in 1919 under Sir Henry Newbolt, and wrote part of its report, which proved an influential defence of English literature as the basis of national education. Dover Wilson was appointed professor of education at King's College, London, in 1924. He began the <span class="italic">Journal of Adult Education</span> in 1926 and, with more enthusiasm, a series called <span class="roman">Landmarks in the History of Education</span>, for which in 1932 he produced a notable edition of Matthew Arnold's <span class="italic">Culture and Anarchy</span>.<br>
<br>The professor of education was, however, overshadowed by the Shakespeare scholar he had now become. Dover Wilson vividly recounted how he was &#145;converted&#146; to Shakespeare on a late-night railway journey in 1917 by reading Greg's <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span> article entitled &#145;Hamlet's hallucination&#146;, which provoked him to a rejoinder. He became &#145;possessed&#146; with <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and confronted with the problems of its text, was led on to those of Shakespeare's text in general&#151;just when the work of Pollard had suggested that the printed versions might be closer to Shakespeare's manuscripts than had been supposed. He seized on the clues contained in spellings, misprints, or mislineations, collecting evidence for <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of &#145;Sir Thomas More&#146;</span> (edited by Pollard, 1923). His notes and articles caught the attention of the Cambridge University Press, which in 1919 invited him to join Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch as a textual expert in editing the <span class="roman">New Cambridge Shakespeare</span>. This edition (1921&#150;66) henceforth dominated his life.<br>
<br>It was Dover Wilson's analysis and treatment of the text which caused the remarkable impact of the early volumes on the academic world. He also prepared a strongly innovative text for the <span class="roman">Cranach <i>Hamlet</i></span> (1930), and his long absorption in the problems of this play had its outcome in the appearance of the <span class="roman">New Cambridge <i>Hamlet</i></span> (1934), together with <span class="italic">The Manuscript of Shakespeare's &#145;Hamlet&#146;</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">What Happens in &#145;Hamlet&#146;</span> (1935). With the last of these and his &#145;biographical adventure&#146;, <span class="italic">The Essential Shakespeare</span> (1932), he captured the imagination of the general public to a degree probably unequalled by any other Shakespearian scholar. Quiller-Couch withdrew from the <span class="roman">New Cambridge</span> edition on the completion of the comedies, and with the histories Dover Wilson was able to range beyond the text to an ambitious critical reappraisal, which resulted in <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Falstaff</span> (1943). He derived satisfaction from his appointment to the regius chair of rhetoric and English literature at Edinburgh in 1935, but in 1945 the claims of his edition, still only half-way through, prompted an early retirement. With steady progress, and presently the aid of younger collaborators (Alice Walker, his pupil G. I. Duthie, and especially J. C. Maxwell) he saw the last play out just after reaching the age of eighty. Then, after the long-projected <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Happy Comedies</span> (1962), he was able to add the sonnets, before at length becoming blind. His wife died in 1961, and in 1963 Dover Wilson married his widowed cousin, Dr Elizabeth Wintringham, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30442/', "Sir Joseph Arkwright (1864&#150;1944)")</script>.<br>
<br>In his determination to fulfil a task undertaken Dover Wilson never lost the spirit of adventure and optimism which characterized his attitude to scholarship as to life. Command of detail was accompanied by a boldness in hypothesis which occasionally struck Quiller-Couch as reckless. Certainly, not all his explanations of particular textual phenomena won, or held, assent, and his enthusiasm for critical innovation was tempered by the self-professedly provisional nature of his arguments. The importance of his edition lies rather in its demonstration of new possibilities and methods; he more than anyone established the editorial practice of investigating the nature of the &#145;copy&#146; through which Shakespeare's plays reached print. As a teacher and lecturer he enjoyed lifelong popularity, and remained a fervent defender of the humanistic mission of Shakespeare studies.<br>
<br>Dover Wilson was elected FBA in 1931 and appointed CH in 1936. In 1936 his Cambridge college made him an honorary fellow. He had taken his Cambridge doctorate in 1926, and subsequently received honorary doctorates from Durham, Edinburgh, Leicester, Lille, London, Natal, and Cambridge. He was a trustee of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust from 1931, and of the National Library of Scotland from 1946. He died at his home, Three Beeches, Balerno, near Edinburgh, on 15 January 1969.<br>
