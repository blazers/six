<span class="headword">Phillips <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Muilman]</span>,  Teresia Constantia</span>  (1709&#150;1765), <span class="occ">courtesan and memoirist</span>, was born on 2 January 1709 at &#145;West-Chester&#146;  (Phillips, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 1.20), part of Chester in Cheshire, the daughter of Thomas Phillips, a captain in the Grenadier Guards. According to her <span class="italic">Apology</span> (1748&#150;9) her father was a well-connected member of an ancient Welsh family. Facing financial difficulties upon his discharge from the army in 1715, he moved with his family to London where he was obliged to distribute his offspring among relations. Phillips was looked after by her godmother, Henrietta Paulet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Crofts), duchess of Bolton. This connection enabled her to attend a Mrs Filler's boarding-school in Prince's Court, Westminster, where she acquired the grace and accomplishments that, along with her sexual allure, would ensure her spectacular success as a courtesan. She was withdrawn from Filler's school following her mother's death about 1720 and her father's subsequent marriage to their servant, perhaps because the duchess of Bolton disapproved of her new stepmother. Her career as a courtesan began at the age of twelve or thirteen as the mistress of a man identified in her <span class="italic">Apology</span> as &#145;Thomas Grimes&#146;. Phillips met Grimes while earning a living as a needle-worker in London, having left home to avoid her stepmother's cruelty. Her connections meant that she often visited Mrs Douglas, the widow of a general, with whom the impoverished Grimes was lodging. According to her account of events, when Grimes began to pursue her she showed his letters to her father who took her back home, but when she again ran away from her stepmother her new lodgings were betrayed to Grimes who plied her with alcohol, tied her to a chair, stripped her, and raped her. Phillips resigned herself to a role as Grimes's mistress until he abandoned her for another adolescent girl after two months. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, followed by many subsequent authors, identified Grimes as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26255/', "Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield")</script>; however, it has been convincingly shown by Lynda M. Thompson that what evidence there is points to his being Thomas Lumley, later third earl of Scarbrough (1690/91?&#150;1752), the dedicatee of the <span class="italic">Apology</span>. As Phillips's detractors have shown, none of the biographical details about Grimes match those of Chesterfield, but Phillips herself never made the connection. Like Grimes, Lumley went to Portugal on public business at the end of 1721, and had an elder brother of distinguished character, whereas Chesterfield was an elder son.<br>
<br>Following her abandonment by Grimes, and already running up debts, Phillips underwent a sham marriage on 11 November 1722 at St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, to a professional bigamist, Francis Delafield or Devall. Delafield, now responsible for Phillips's debts, then joined her father's regiment, the company of invalids based at Portsmouth. She then married, on 9 February 1724, at the same church, Henry Muilman (1700&#150;1772), the elder son of the Amsterdam merchant Pieter Schout Muilman and brother of the antiquary Peter Muilman. While she maintained that calumny turned him and his family against her, it seems more likely that it was the unpleasant discovery of her sexual past that made Muilman sue for an annulment of the marriage. While involved in endless court battles with her husband, Phillips embarked upon a series of liaisons with &#145;at least seven wealthy and well-connected men&#146;  (Stone, 258).<br>
<br>Phillips's affairs, like her court battles, are confusing in the extreme. She was the mistress of a &#145;Mr B.&#146;, and of the gardener <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53221/', "Philip Southcote (1697/8&#150;1758)")</script> on and off for about five years. The latter she refers to as &#145;Tartuffe&#146; in her <span class="italic">Apology</span> and depicts him as effeminate and mercenary. Other lovers included Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, fifth baronet (<i>c</i>.1701&#150;1748), tory MP, who twice attempted suicide to prevent Phillips from leaving him, a &#145;Lord F.&#146;, and even her surgeon. Though the motivation for these affairs was largely financial, she laid herself open to charges of sexual depravity from Muilman and his lawyers, and in 1774 Horace Walpole would famously consider her nymphomania equal to that of Catherine the Great  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 24.35). The recounting of her liaisons, along with convoluted court depositions from her messy divorce and indefatigable attempts to make Muilman pay up, make up her three-volume <span class="italic">Apology</span>. The aim of this was clearly in part to blackmail wealthy ex-lovers, but Phillips used the dedication to refer to the text as &#145;this unpleasing Method of justifying myself to the World, as well as relieving my Fortune&#146;  (Phillips, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 1.1). It is not overly titillating. Despite the generosity of many of her lovers, Phillips had experienced frequent bouts of poverty as a result of her extravagant lifestyle and legal fees. Between 1742 and 1744 she was arrested for debt and imprisoned in the king's bench prison. She periodically fled to France to avoid either creditors or importunate lovers. Though she was clearly interested in making a good sale and repairing her damaged finances, her <span class="italic">Apology</span> is often tedious and confusing as she gives minutely detailed accounts of the extenuating circumstances surrounding each affair, and its financial cost. Though supposedly written with scrupulous honesty, Phillips tends to limit her self-accusation to a natural love of pleasure and a lack of prudence. Publication of the <span class="italic">Apology</span> was followed by an exchange of pamphlets which included <span class="italic">A Defence of the Character of a Noble Lord</span> (1748), issued on behalf of Grimes; <span class="italic">A Genuine Copy of the Tryal of Thomas Grymes, esq., alias Lord S&#151;, from a Barbarous and Inhuman Rape, Committed on the Body of Miss T. C. P.</span> (1748); a <span class="italic">Counter-Apology</span> (1749), intended to discredit her; and from Phillips herself a second edition of the <span class="italic">Apology</span> to which was attached <span class="italic">A Letter Humbly Address'd to the Right Honourable the Earl of Chesterfield</span> (1750). The <span class="italic">Apology</span> was advertised heavily in <span class="italic">Old England</span>, the journal for which Chesterfield wrote, and the tone of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> suggests that Phillips and Chesterfield may have been lovers during this period.<br>
<br>After 1751 Phillips fades from view, and seems to have spent the final ten or so years of her life in Kingston, Jamaica. There, according to an anonymous piece in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1766), she made three bigamous marriages, to &#145;Mr M.&#146;, an Irish land surveyor, then to &#145;Mr S. C.&#146;, a Scotsman and commissary for French prisoners of war in Jamaica, and finally to a Frenchman named Lanteniac  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 83&#150;4). According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> she died in Kingston, Jamaica, on 2 February 1765, &#145;unlamented by a single person&#146;  (ibid., 84). She was also buried there.<br>
<br>Notorious in her own day, Phillips remains a figure of historical interest as she used her damaged reputation to her own ends, and bitterly decried the sexual double standard. In this she had some success; Samuel Richardson remarked to Lady Bradshaigh on 15 December 1748:<blockquote>What think you has not Mr. Grimes to answer for, in the ruin of Constantia Phillips when but Eleven Years of Age, and abandoning her to the Town in two Months, if the story she tells be true?&#151;What Ruins, the Consequence of <i>her</i> Ruin, may not be laid at his Door. (<span class="italic">Selected Letters of Samuel Richardson</span>, ed. J. Carroll, 1964, 115)</blockquote>Maintaining that her <span class="italic">Apology</span> acted as a kind of cautionary tale to warn heedless young girls of the sexual snares that awaited them, she declared, with a great degree of truth: &#145;A Woman may want conjugal Affection, Integrity, Sobriety, maternal Tenderness, Frugality, Good-Nature, Patience, Temperance, Prudence, Charity, and, in fine, every social Virtue, if she contrive to keep her <i>Person chaste</i> &hellip; all is well in the World's Opinion&#146;  (Phillips, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 3.7&#150;8).<br>
