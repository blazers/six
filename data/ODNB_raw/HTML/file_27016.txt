<span class="headword">Taylor,  Abraham</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1726&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Independent minister and tutor</span>, was the son of Richard Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1717), Independent minister of Little Moorfields, London. He was a classical scholar and trenchant defender of Calvinist orthodoxy. His first (anonymous) publication, <span class="italic">The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity Vindicated</span> (1726; 2nd edn, 1728) was directed at Isaac Watts, and shows his strict adherence to orthodoxy, against Watts's more reconciling spirit. At about the same time (though not published until 1732) he wrote a two-volume defence of the Trinity &#145;in opposition to the Arian scheme&#146;. In 1730 he published a dismissive <span class="italic">Letter to the author (Strickland Gough) of an enquiry into the causes of the decay of the dissenting interest</span>; Gough, a dissenting minister, had taken orders in the Church of England.<br>
<br>This work brought Taylor to the notice of William Coward, who appointed him one of nine preachers of a weekly lecture in defence of Calvinism at Paved Alley, Lime Street. The lectures, including four by Taylor, were delivered in 1730&#150;31 and published in 1732. While the lectures were proceeding, the King's Head Society (founded 1730) selected Taylor as divinity tutor. After a two-year classical course under Samuel Parsons at Clerkenwell, the students were sent to Taylor for four years at Deptford, where he had been minister since 1728, and had been ordained in 1731. Though he had a harsh temperament, revealed in 1732 in an angry controversy with John Gill, one of the Lime Street lecturers, in point of attainment Taylor was well fitted for the post. Alexander Cruden, commending Taylor to Marischal College, Aberdeen, for the award of DD wrote: &#145;he exceeds all the Dissenting ministers of my acquaintance for Learning&#146;  (P. J. Anderson, <span class="italic">Fasti academiae Aberdonensis</span>, 1897, 2.82). The doctorate was awarded in 1736.<br>
<br>Taylor preached and published several exhortations and funeral sermons, most notably that for his close friend and former pastor John Hurrion, minister of Hare-court, Aldersgate (1733). Such was his influence that Philip Doddridge's friends feared the academy which Coward proposed to endow after his death would be put under Taylor rather than Doddridge; and later that the settlement of Coward's will would favour Taylor, and &#145;Bigotry [be] intailed on the rising Generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar</span>, ed. Nuttall, 85 [no. 467]). These fears proved unfounded, but Coward's trustees, who included Watts, withdrew financial support from the seven of Taylor's students whom Coward had been funding personally until his death in April 1738, and resolved to place no more with him. To what extent these decisions contributed to Taylor's financial difficulties is only conjecture, but in 1740, after enquiry into his circumstances, the King's Head Society dismissed Taylor, who disappears from the public record and is thought to have died in penury.<br>
