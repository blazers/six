</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mays,  (Thomas) Raymond</span>  (1899&#150;1980), <span class="occ">racing driver and businessman</span>, was born at Eastgate House, Bourne, Lincolnshire, on 1 August 1899, the only child of Thomas William Mays (1856&#150;1934), woolstapler and later manufacturer of fertilizer, and his wife, Annie Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shilcock (1875&#150;1973). His father was a pioneer motorist who competed in hill climbs and speed trials. Raymond or Ray, as he was known, often accompanied him to competitions and on business trips by road. Even as a small child Mays was fascinated, if not obsessed, by cars and speed.<br>
<br>Mays was taught at home before entering Oundle School, Northamptonshire, in May 1912, where he remained until December 1917. At school he enjoyed tennis and rugby but &#145;never worked any harder than necessary&#146;  (Mays, <span class="italic">Split Seconds</span>, 14). A few days after leaving Oundle he joined the Guards officer training establishment at Bushey Hall, Hertfordshire. He was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards in May 1918 and was initially posted to Chelsea. He stayed at the luxurious Grosvenor Hotel rather than in barracks and indulged to the full his taste for the high life and musical theatre. He saw Jos&eacute; Collins in <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span> over eighty times. In October he was posted to Maubeuge in France and after the armistice to Cologne, where life was &#145;pleasant and &hellip; peaceful&#146;  (ibid., 18).<br>
<br>Mays declined a permanent army commission and in October 1919 entered Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read engineering. His father always intended him for the family wool business but Mays's compelling ambition was &#145;to make my mark in motor-racing&#146;  (Mays, <span class="italic">Split Seconds</span>, 19). Having acquired a Speed Model Hillman for which his father reluctantly paid, he and Amherst Villiers of Caius College, Cambridge, another motor-obsessed Old Oundelian, devoted more time to motoring than to their academic pursuits. In 1920, the year he began competing, Mays won both the Cambridge University Auto Club hill climb and the inter-varsity hill climb at Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. In 1921 he secured the first of numerous wins on the Brooklands circuit. That summer he entered as many climbs and speed trials as he could manage. These included his first attempt at the renowned Shelsley Walsh speed hill climb, an event that had fascinated him from childhood. Thereafter he entered it repeatedly, recording fastest time of the day on over twenty occasions and setting records several times.<br>
<br>In 1921, with his father's business struggling, Mays left university without taking a degree. After a few months gaining experience with a wool firm in Glastonbury he joined the family firm on a salary of &pound;260 p.a. Cars, however, remained his preoccupation even though his aspirations far outstripped his financial resources. Through charm and persuasion he acquired a Brescia Bugatti, which he could scarcely afford, and the sponsorship in kind from Englebert Tyres, Speedwell Oil, and Lodge Plugs that allowed him to continue competing. He may have been the first sponsored driver  (<span class="italic">Autocar</span>, 19 Jan 1980). Mays specialized in hill climbs, though he also raced an aeroplane across Skegness beach. Throughout he was greatly assisted by Villiers, who supplied design and mechanical expertise in return for free board and lodging at the Mays family home, Eastgate House, Bourne.<br>
<br>In 1923 Mays set the Shelsley Walsh record for the first time, beating Malcolm Campbell into third place. Mays welcomed the resulting publicity because it improved his chances of securing much-needed financial assistance. He obtained support from Ettore Bugatti, Humphrey Cook, his wealthy friend and fellow racer, and Selwyn Edge, a motor racing pioneer who was managing director of AC cars. His partnership with AC was unsuccessful but from the late 1920s, aided by Cook, Villiers, Peter Berthon, and Murray Jamieson, he became a dominant force in British motor sport at the wheel of Mercedes-Benz, Vauxhall-Villiers, Invictas, and Rileys. Cook had inherited a large fortune from his family's drapery business, and in 1933 he suggested forming a company to develop a British racing car with Riley engines to compete in international Voiturette class events, offering also to back the project financially. Berthon, Jamieson, and Reid Railton contributed as designers and Mays was fund-raiser and driver. Victor Riley agreed to co-operate and English Racing Automobiles (ERA), whose cars bore a badge designed by Gordon Crosby, was launched at Bourne in late 1933.<br>
<br>Mays was the ERA project's &#145;leading light&#146; and &#145;star personality&#146;  (Fletcher, 226). ERA unveiled its first car at Brooklands in 1934. The firm initially ran purely as a works team but, later, models were sold and raced privately by Earl Howe, Dick Seaman, Prince Bira, the band leader Billy Cotton, and others. Though initially dogged by handling problems, ERAs &#145;were the first cars for many a year to represent Britain in international motor racing and bring it regular success at such level&#146;  (McGregor, 2). Before a crowd of around 400,000 at the N&uuml;rburgring in 1935 ERAs took four of the first five places. Mays himself won.<br>
<br>ERA foundered in 1939 when Cook opposed the plan of Mays and Berthon to establish Automobile Developments Ltd, for the production of distinctively British grand prix cars. Cook wound up ERA's Bourne operation, while the plans of Mays and Berthon were suspended with the outbreak of the Second World War. In June 1939, on the eve of the war, Mays achieved a 37.37 second run in an ERA R4D at the Shelsley Walsh speed hill climb, which was not bettered for ten years.<br>
<br>In 1945 Mays formed Raymond Mays and Partners Ltd, to retail Rolls Royce and Bentley road cars, having owned a Bentley Derby since 1935. Subsequently he took on a Ford dealership and &#145;Raymond Mays Converted&#146; Fords competed in early saloon car races. He also returned to competition, winning the RAC national hill climbing championship in 1947 and 1948, its first two years. Between 1946 and 1950 he won the standing start kilometre event at Brighton speed trials in an ERA R4D four times. He stopped competing in 1950 to concentrate on the British Racing Motors or Berthon Raymond Mays (BRM) project.<br>
<br>Mays and Berthon founded BRM Ltd at Eastgate House in 1945 with the aim of building an all-British grand prix car that could beat continental constructors and enhance national prestige. The &#145;age of austerity&#146; was an inauspicious time to launch the project but Mays personally secured substantial financial support from motor accessory and engineering companies. The British Motor Racing Research Trust was formed to administer contributions from some 350 firms. Well-equipped workshops behind Eastgate House soon housed a workforce of around thirty. The first BRM, with its distinctive and ear-splitting roar, was completed in December 1949. When demonstrated before the royal family and a huge crowd at Silverstone in May 1950, however, the car failed to leave the grid. This &#145;wretched launching was almost an omen of what lay ahead&#146;  (Stanley, 47). The BRM project, in many ways muddled and directionless, encountered prolonged financial, legal, administrative, and technical problems, as well as some appalling luck. Mays, for all his charm and enthusiasm, lacked the &#145;temperament and training to weld together a winning Grand Prix team&#146;  (ibid., 12).<br>
<br>In 1952 the British Motor Racing Research Trust sold out to one of its principal supporters, another Old Oundelian, Alfred Owen of Rubery Owen, the Black Country engineering firm. Owen Racing took over the project though Mays remained involved as race manager, publicist, and fund-raiser. BRM's chequered history continued, though its cars recorded successes with such drivers as Juan Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, and Stirling Moss. A first formula 1 grand prix victory was achieved in 1959 but the team's greatest triumph came in 1962 when Graham Hill became world champion and BRM secured the constructor's championship. By this time Mays's involvement was marginal. BRM severed all links with Bourne in 1974.<br>
<br>Mays produced two &#145;ghosted&#146; books: <span class="italic">Split Seconds</span> (1951), an autobiography which one reviewer judged &#145;perhaps the most interesting of the many motor-racing books published since the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 10 Aug 1951), and <span class="italic">BRM</span> (1962). It was suspected that the authors of <span class="italic">BRM</span> must have glossed over any number of matters to avoid libel actions  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 14 Dec 1962). Mays contributed an &#145;excellent&#146; chapter on hill-climbing technique for Lord Howe's volume on <span class="italic">Motor Racing</span> (1939) in the <span class="roman">Lonsdale Library</span> series  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 12 Aug 1939) and a piece for <span class="italic">Speed: the Book of Racing and Records</span> (1950). For all his driving skill he accumulated twenty-nine motoring convictions and fines totalling &pound;134 by March 1936  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 March 1936).<br>
<br>Mays was sociable, elegant, debonair, and intensely patriotic. His cars and clothing, down to the black beret and neck ties he often wore when racing, were always immaculate and his conversation was peppered with extravagant phraseology. He &#145;chain smoked all the time&#146;  (Fletcher, 228). In appearance he was tall and slim with a military bearing. His dark wavy hair was receding by his twenties and he was bald in later life. Mays loved to entertain and over the years many theatrical stars including Ivor Novello, Norma Shearer, Ben Lyon, and Bebe Daniels visited Eastgate House. When he was a castaway on BBC's <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> in 1969 his choice of music reflected his long-standing love of the stage. He chose an umbrella as his luxury and W. MacQueen Pope's <span class="italic">Gaiety: Theatre of Enchantment</span> (1949) as his book. Aside from his fixations with cars and musicals he was an accomplished dancer and tennis enthusiast.<br>
<br>Mays, who never married, spent his whole life at Eastgate House, Bourne, in the company of his beloved mother until 1973. After her death he lived alone, a somewhat isolated figure. He was made CBE in 1978. Mays died at home on 6 January 1980. After his funeral, at Bourne Abbey church on 11 January, he was cremated. A memorial service at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, took place on 22 January. His connection with Bourne has been commemorated by a blue plaque on Eastgate House, a memorial unveiled in 1984, and through Raymond Mays Way, otherwise known as the Bourne by-pass or A151. In October 2012 celebrations in Bourne commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1962 world championship triumph.<br>
<br>Mays was one of the great drivers of his day. As a motor sport businessman his achievements were less clear cut. He acknowledged that BRM did not achieve all he had hoped for but was probably right to claim that the project laid the foundation for Britain's later success in top-level motor sport  (Mays and Roberts, 211).<br>
