<span class="headword">Schleger <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Schlesinger]</span>,  Hans</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Zero]</span>  (1898&#150;1976), <span class="occ">graphic designer</span>, was born on 29 December 1898 in Kempen, Posen, Prussia, the second of two sons of Eduard Schlesinger (1859&#150;1932), doctor of medicine, and his wife, Bianca Mendelsohn (1871&#150;1941/2). Both his parents were Jewish. About 1904 the family moved from Kempen to Berlin where Hans attended day school, bored by academic studies but showing precocious talent at drawing. He served unwillingly with the German pioneer corps in the First World War, throwing away the Iron Cross which he was awarded when war ended. He shortened his name to Schleger by the time he was twenty and was studying painting and drawing at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Berlin.<br>
<br>Schleger's modernist vivacity as a designer and the range of his activity in a career that was to embrace the design of posters, packaging, exhibitions, trade marks, and corporate images can be traced back to the influence of the Bauhaus, strong in Berlin culture in the early 1920s. He consistently followed Bauhaus principles of reduction to essentials and he believed in demolishing barriers between fine and applied arts. Poster art as a populist, modernist medium attracted him: he was an early admirer of the work of A. M. Cassandre and Lucian Bernhard.<br>
<br>After leaving the Kunstgewerbeschule, Schleger's first job was for John Hagenbeck's idiosyncratic film company, where he was responsible for everything from publicity design to film sets. At a time when consumer advertising was emerging as a fully-fledged profession Schleger was intrigued by new techniques of visual persuasion, with their roots in behavioural sciences and the interpretation of desire.<br>
<br>In 1924 Schleger set off adventurously to New York, travelling on an oil tanker from Bremen. He spoke only limited English, had very little money and no contacts. It was now he adopted the signature Zero, a wry comment on his status as a designer starting out from scratch as well as an assertion of his emancipation from graphic traditions of the past. His creative originality was obvious in the advertising work that soon came the way of &#145;the <i>Wunderkind</i>, Hans Schleger, the young Berlin graphic artist, who is of all the post-war &eacute;migr&eacute; artists the most successful&#146;, as he was already being described in the German professional journal <span class="italic">Gebrauchsgraphik</span> for February 1926.<br>
<br>Schleger's techniques were sophisticated. His famous series of advertisements for men's outfitters Weber and Heilbroner use photography in a then enterprising way, integrate text and image with reductionist aplomb, and introduce one of the earliest of Schleger's masterly trade marks, the three linked Homburg-hatted men about town. The illustrations made by Schleger for Park and Tilford Candies and Gunther Furriers, gently satiric of the luxuries they advertise, have a wonderful elegance of line. His dramatic magazine advertisements for the Empire State Engraving Company show Schleger's own ambivalent response to New York city, at once a place of nightmare and of fascination.<br>
<br>The Wall Street crash encouraged Schleger to give up his Madison Avenue office. Another influence was his first cousin, Annemarie Mendelsohn (<i>b</i>. 1906), whom he married soon after his return to Germany, on 1 December 1929. Schleger was now employed as an art director by W. S. Crawford, a branch of the progressive London advertising agency recently set up in Berlin. In the dislocated atmosphere of Berlin at that period he arrived at images of beautiful decadence, notably in a series of airbrush illustrations used as advertisements for Hudnut, the perfumiers.<br>
<br>Unnerved by the growing political intolerance Schleger left Germany in 1932, and arrived in England, a country he had never even visited in spite of his American reputation as a connoisseur of English upper-class style. His contacts among Crawford's modernist designers, Ashley Havinden and E. McKnight Kauffer in particular, were helpful in establishing him quickly at the centre of London avant-garde design. Schleger and his wife moved into a penthouse flat in Swan Court, Chelsea, adjacent to that occupied by McKnight Kauffer and the American textile designer Marion Dorn.<br>
<br>Schleger's work in the 1930s had a wit and sureness that did much to spread the visual language of modernism in the Britain of that time. His posters for Shell, London Transport, and various government departments were widely circulated. In 1935 Frank Pick commissioned the famous London Transport bus-stop sign which survived for many decades. Schleger's series of advertisements for the corset maker Charnaux harnessed surrealism to commercial art. Success encouraged him to remain in England and he became a British citizen in 1939.<br>
<br>The early years of the Second World War were traumatic for Hans Schleger. Work dried up. He left London and rented a cheap isolated cottage in Cobham, Surrey. His mother, whom he had failed to persuade to join him in London, was taken in November 1941 on the first transport train from Berlin to Teresienstadt and then to the ghetto in Minsk. The exact date of her death remains unknown. Schleger's wife left him and they were divorced in 1943. The strain of these events was extreme, and he began psychoanalysis which continued until his second marriage, to his design assistant, Patricia Marigold (Pat) Maycock (<i>b</i>. 1928) on 11 February 1956.<br>
<br>But professionally Schleger was soon in demand again. He designed cheerfully demotic war propaganda posters: for example &#145;Grow your Own&#146; for the Dig for Victory campaign. After the war he expanded his practice, becoming a consultant to the advertising agency Mather and Crowther and setting up his own office, Hans Schleger and Associates at 14 Avenue Studios in Chelsea, a purpose-built studio occupied by John Singer Sargent at the turn of the century.<br>
<br>Schleger became the most important pioneer of British corporate identity, comparable only with F. H. K. Henrion, another European &eacute;migr&eacute;. He was responsible for brilliant new visual interpretations of MacFisheries and Finmar, Fisons, and ICI. For twelve years he designed the graphics for the Edinburgh Festival, a formative influence in establishing its cultural significance. Schleger's rare combination of subtlety and boldness made him especially adept at the trade mark, evolving memorable symbols for Penguin Books, John Lewis, the Design Centre, and Hutchinsons. Examples of his designs are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London's Transport Museum, and the Imperial War Museum, London, and the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra.<br>
<br>Schleger became a royal designer for industry in 1959. But in spite of many subsequent accolades and international honours Schleger never lost his edginess, easy to mistake for arrogance, and he was most at ease with his young office staff, his wife, and his two daughters. On the genial continental pattern, Schleger's domestic and office lives were merged. He died at his home, 15 The Boltons, London, of heart failure on 18 September 1976. His funeral service was held at St Mary the Boltons, and Schleger was cremated on 24 September at Putney Vale crematorium; he was an outstandingly resourceful and idealistic artist&#150;designer who affected profoundly the visual life of his adopted land.<br>
