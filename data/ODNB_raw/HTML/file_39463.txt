<span class="headword">Hastings,  George Woodyatt</span>  (1825&#150;1917), <span class="occ">social reformer and politician</span>, was born on 28 September 1825 at 43 Foregate Street, Worcester, the second of three children, and the only son, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12560/', "Sir Charles Hastings (1794&#150;1866)")</script>, physician and founder of the British Medical Association (BMA), and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1866), eldest daughter of George Woodyatt MD, physician to the Worcester Infirmary. He was educated at Bromsgrove grammar school and at Christ's College, Cambridge (1844&#150;50), where he took a first class in civil law; he was admitted to the Middle Temple in November 1846 and called to the bar in May 1850. He practised as a barrister for the next twenty-one years. From his father, a Liberal in politics who not only helped organize the medical profession but was active in several causes, including anti-slavery and the improvement of public health, he inherited a taste for public service. He assisted his father and the BMA in drafting, and lobbying for, versions of the bill which became the 1858 <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> and established the modern medical profession in Britain. In the 1850s he was secretary of the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, a London-based pressure group seeking to rationalize and improve aspects of English law, and of the National Reformatory Union, concerned with the care and moral redemption of young offenders. Lord Brougham, who provided patronage for Hastings, was president of both organizations. In the period from 1855 to 1857 Hastings was instrumental in joining together these two groups with a third constituency&#151;those women who had come together as the Langham Place circle to publish the <span class="italic">English Woman's Journal</span>&#151;to form the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, which held the first of its annual congresses in 1857 and which disbanded in 1886.<br>
<br>The Social Science Association, so-called, was modelled on the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and became an important forum for the promotion of institutional and legislative reform in mid-Victorian Britain. It was Hastings's role at the heart of the organization, first as secretary and then, from 1868, in succession to Brougham, as president, which brought him a place in public life. He was known to the whole political and administrative class of the age as an expert on social questions. His interests were broad, including not only legal and penal reform but also the promotion of women's causes. Among other projects, he assisted the foundation of Girton College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Hastings was married first, on 10 August 1858, to Catherine Anna, daughter of the Revd Samuel Mence, rector of Ulcombe, Kent. She died without children in 1871. His second wife, Frances Anna (<i>d</i>. 1915), whom he married in 1877, was the only child of the Revd W. H. Pillans, rector of Himley, Staffordshire. They had three children.<br>
<br>From 1854 Hastings was unsuccessful in several attempts to secure the Liberal nomination as a candidate for various seats in parliament. Adopted for West Worcestershire, he failed to win election in 1874 but was elected Liberal MP for Worcestershire East in 1880, which he represented until 1892, sitting after 1886 as a Liberal Unionist. He served in many capacities in Worcestershire, including chairman of the quarter sessions and of the new county council. Hastings was representative of a new type of figure who entered politics through campaigns and movements for social reform. But Victorian Britain had not yet developed professional structures and organizations for this kind of public service, which remained voluntary and unpaid. He was expelled from the House of Commons on 21 March 1892 following his conviction for fraudulent conversion. As sole trustee of a substantial fund for the education of a deceased friend's children, he had used the capital for his own purposes, could not repay it, and was sentenced to five years' penal servitude. He had many outstanding debts in addition: his finances had never been adequate for the life he led as a public figure, and he had speculated without success. On his expulsion, the prime minister, Gladstone, paid tribute to his &#145;special services to the House&#146;.<br>
<br>On his release Hastings lived quietly in his native county. In 1909 he published <span class="italic">A Vindication of Warren Hastings</span>, his famous ancestor, and two years later, <span class="italic">The Story of the Malverns</span>. He died on 21 October 1917, and was buried in the churchyard of Guarlford, near Malvern.<br>
