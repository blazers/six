<span class="headword">Roches,  Peter  des</span> <span class="st"> [Peter  de Rupibus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1238), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Winchester</span>, was a native of the Touraine in north-western France, sprung from the same knightly dynasty, centred upon Ch&acirc;teau-du-Loir, as Guillaume des Roches (<i>d</i>. 1222), seneschal of Anjou and one of the leading figures in the government of Philip Augustus, king of France.<h2>
<a name="ServantoftheAngevinkings11971212"></a>Servant of the Angevin kings, 1197&#150;1212</h2>Peter des Roches first appears in April 1197 as witness to a charter of Richard I of England, issued at Tours, and thereafter it was in Tours and the adjoining region that he built up a substantial collection of benefices, being appointed prior of Loches, dean of St Martin's at Angers, and treasurer, effectively head, of the great collegiate church of St Hilaire at Poitiers. According to the chronicler Roger of Wendover, in his youth des Roches had been better versed in how to lay siege to a castle than in preaching the word of God, and it is apparent that this distinctly secular, military reputation continued to mark him out in the eyes of his contemporaries. As a leading member of the chamber, the household financial department of King John, he crossed to England after the loss of Normandy in 1203, and was rewarded with a rich haul of benefices, including the churches of Cave, Hales, Kirby Misperton, and possibly Dartford, a prebend and the office of precentor in Lincoln Cathedral, and a perpetual vicarage at Bamburgh. In April 1204 he was granted the right to dispose of prebends and rents within the vacant see of Chichester, and following the death of Bishop Godfrey de Lucy in September 1204, was proposed as the king's candidate for the vastly wealthy see of Winchester. His election received the assent of a majority of the Winchester monks, but was opposed by the archdeacons of Winchester and Surrey who sought to promote Richard Poor (<i>d</i>. 1235), dean of Salisbury, the son of a former bishop of Winchester, Richard of Ilchester (<i>d</i>. 1188). In the spring of 1205 the election dispute was carried to Rome where, after protracted and costly litigation financed on des Roches's behalf by the king, the pope was persuaded to confirm des Roches's election and to consecrate him as bishop on 25 September 1205. The temporalities of his see were restored to him on 24 March 1206 and two days later, on Palm Sunday, he was enthroned as bishop in Winchester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Peter des Roches resumed his activities at court, where between 1206 and 1214 he served in effect as head of the king's chamber, responsible for expenditure on castles and military operations, and for the entertainment of diplomatic envoys from France, Spain, and the papal court. A satirical poem written during these years describes him as &#145;The warrior of Winchester, up at the exchequer, keen on finance, slack at the scriptures&#146;  (Wright, 10&#150;11). The circumstances of his election in Rome had led to the issue of papal letters, exempting des Roches from suspension or excommunication by any ecclesiastical authority save that of the pope. The intention appears to have been to assist des Roches in a mission, sponsored by the pope, to secure the payment of &#145;Peter's pence&#146; by the English church. The mission itself proved abortive, but des Roches's letters henceforward afforded him a unique degree of independence from the jurisdiction of the archbishops of Canterbury. There is no evidence that he ever made a formal profession of obedience to Canterbury, and between 1208 and 1213, when England was placed under interdict by the pope, des Roches was one of only two English bishops who remained in attendance at the court of the excommunicate King John. As a keen huntsman and a considerable patron of the arts, he can be ranked among the inner circle of John's friends, involved in the exploitation of the Jews, the collection of royal taxation, and the denial and sale of justice. From 1212 at the latest John entrusted des Roches with the custody of his eldest son and heir, the future Henry III, who thus grew up in the bishop's household.<h2>
<a name="Justiciarandsoldier12121220"></a>Justiciar and soldier, 1212&#150;1220</h2>In 1206 des Roches accompanied the king on a brief expedition to Poitou, and in 1211 he was set to command part of the army sent against the Welsh. As a Frenchman and an extremely wealthy bishop he gave patronage and support to a group of his fellow aliens, the knights Peter (I) de Maulay (<i>d</i>. 1241), Engelard de Cigogn&eacute;, and the various kinsmen of the king's mercenary commander, Girard d'Ath&eacute;e (<i>d</i>. 1213), whose foreign background was to make them mistrusted by the native English baronage. In his episcopal household he retained a large number of Normans, Poitevins, and his own fellow Tourangeaux. In 1213 he served as <i>de facto</i> royal chancellor, and in February 1214 was appointed as the king's chief justiciar, to govern England during John's disastrous expedition to Poitou. It is a measure of his pre-eminence in government during the months that followed that he should have had his own close roll to record his acts. As justiciar he was to be accused of favouritism towards his fellow aliens, and he undoubtedly played a part in the collection of the controversial scutage demanded from those who refused to serve in person in Poitou, in the promotion of various royalists to vacant bishoprics and abbeys, and in the worsening relations between royal government and the city of London. As such his actions helped speed the outbreak of civil war. As regent justiciar in 1214 des Roches also made an unsuccessful bid to obtain promotion to the archbishopric of York, while the king suggested that he accept translation to the bishopric of Durham, an offer des Roches refused.<br>
<br>During the ensuing civil war des Roches supported the king against the barons. Following the issue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> on 15 June 1215, to which he stood witness, he was deposed as justiciar in favour of the Englishman, Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243). Thereafter he was active in attempts to have the charter repudiated by the pope, and himself imposed papal sentence of excommunication upon the rebels, and pronounced the suspension of the archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton (<i>d</i>. 1228), at Dover in September 1215. During the war Winchester itself was seized by the rebels, but from his base at Taunton in the west country des Roches lent financial and military support to the crown. He served as one of the executors of King John, and attended the coronation of his former ward, Henry III, at Gloucester on 28 October 1216, playing a leading role in the ceremony. In the aftermath he was entrusted with the continuing care of the nine-year-old king. At the battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1216 it was des Roches who commanded the royal crossbowmen and who, through a daring reconnaissance, discovered a blocked-up gate which served as the royalists' point of entry to the city. He took many prisoners in the battle, and is said to have extracted heavy ransoms from them. In September 1216 he was one of the first royalists to enter the city of London, to accept the rebels' surrender of the Tower of London. Thereafter he resumed his activities at the royal exchequer and in the king's household, taking charge of the county of Hampshire as sheriff and of several royal castles and forests. Perhaps angered at the royalists' failure to impose a harsher settlement on the defeated rebels, he refused to contribute to a tax intended to fund an indemnity to the departing army of Louis of France, and within the next few years his exploitation of his custodies as sheriff and forester, his patronage of his fellow aliens, and his strained personal relations with Hubert de Burgh and the other leading members of the minority council, placed him in an increasingly isolated position. In 1220 he attended the second coronation of Henry III, at Canterbury, but thereafter he appears to have decided to set out on crusade, having been nominated by the pope as archbishop of Damietta.<h2>
<a name="Theintermittentcrusader12201231"></a>The intermittent crusader, 1220&#150;1231</h2>As a preliminary act of piety, in the spring of 1221 he undertook a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. In the bishop's absence Hubert de Burgh staged an attack upon des Roches's principal allies, the aliens Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; (<i>d</i>. 1226) and Peter de Maulay. Maulay was deprived of his offices as constable and sheriff and briefly imprisoned, accused of plotting with Bishop Peter to deliver up England to the French. The accusations were dismissed on des Roches's return from Spain, but none the less the bishop never recovered custody of the boy king, Henry III, and in the winter of 1221, following the collapse of the fifth crusade, his plans to journey to the Holy Land had to be indefinitely postponed. Des Roches now sought to recover the initiative at court by having the pope declare the end of Henry III's minority, in advance of Henry's twenty-first birthday. Letters to this effect were obtained in Rome in 1223, but in the ensuing crisis it was de Burgh and Archbishop Langton who used the letters against des Roches, forcing the latter to relinquish custody of Hampshire and its royal castles. In company with other veterans of John's reign, including Ranulf (III), earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1232), des Roches briefly toyed with the idea of rebellion, staging a Christmas court at Leicester in December 1223 in deliberate opposition to the king's court held at Northampton. In the event, however, des Roches and the opposition capitulated, and in the following year joined forces with de Burgh against Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; and the few remaining rebels who had garrisoned Bedford against the crown. Des Roches was henceforth excluded from the king's inner counsels. Accounts were demanded from him for his time as sheriff, and in 1227 he was fined the considerable sum of &pound;500 in return for acquittance from all his past debts to the exchequer. In June or July 1227 he set out for the Holy Land in company with William Brewer, bishop of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1244).<br>
<br>On crusade he sided with the emperor Frederick II against the local church hierarchy and the pope. He is said to have acted as leader of the English contingent on crusade, and to have played a major role in the refortification of the crusader castles of Sidon, Ascalon, and Jaffa, while in March 1229 he was one of the crusaders permitted to enter Jerusalem, recently won back to Christian rule through diplomatic rather than military means. In Jerusalem he is said to have assisted the emperor in rebuilding the city's fortifications, including the Gate of St Stephen and the Tower of David. Criticized by the patriarch of Jerusalem for his overt support for the emperor, and briefly suspended from office by the pope, des Roches followed Frederick II back to Italy in May 1229, arriving at the papal court about 22 July. Thereafter, at San Germano and Ceprano, he helped to negotiate a peace treaty between the emperor and the pope. He spent much of the next two years in residence at the papal court, and it was not until July 1231, after an absence of nearly five years, that he returned to England.<h2>
<a name="Civilwarandpoliticaldefeat12311238"></a>Civil war and political defeat, 1231&#150;1238</h2>In des Roches's absence Henry III had grown increasingly impatient with the style of government favoured by his chief minister, Hubert de Burgh. A mounting crisis in royal finance had been compounded by costly and unsuccessful campaigns in France and in Wales. Des Roches is said to have urged the king to adopt a new financial strategy, advocating a stronger, more autocratic approach to government. The king spent the Christmas feast of 1231 as des Roches's guest at Winchester, and in the following month des Roches was readmitted as a baron of the royal exchequer. With de Burgh's position in decline des Roches obtained promotion for his kinsman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23688/', "Peter de Rivallis (d. 1262)")</script>, who in the summer of 1232 was rapidly advanced to a series of royal offices and the custody of numerous valuable estates. In July 1232 de Burgh attempted to halt this process, obtaining the issue of royal charters guaranteeing him in possession of his office as justiciar. However, probably through des Roches's influence, de Burgh was shortly afterwards accused of complicity in a series of attacks upon foreign clergy in England, and after 28 July 1232 was stripped of office. It was des Roches, acting in company with Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, who headed the subsequent purge of de Burgh and his supporters from court, and the promotion in their stead of a group of men who had last held office in the years of des Roches's ascendancy before 1223. During this same period the chroniclers allege that des Roches urged the king to make war on his disobedient barons, to emulate the example of the emperor Frederick II, and to return to the style of government favoured by King John. De Burgh was imprisoned at Devizes, and in the first few weeks of 1233 des Roches's henchman, his nephew Peter de Rivallis, was promoted as royal treasurer in place of Walter Mauclerk, bishop of Carlisle (<i>d</i>. 1248). At the same time, probably at des Roches's prompting, the king began to overturn a large number of royal charters, supposedly guaranteeing lands and offices in perpetuity to de Burgh and his supporters.<br>
<br>However, one of the victims of this purge, Gilbert Basset (<i>d</i>. 1241), who was a close associate of Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, rebelled in the spring of 1233, forcing the Marshal to take sides with him against des Roches. As a result the country was plunged into nearly a year of civil war. The role of des Roches in these hostilities is difficult to assess. Although undoubtedly responsible for the advancement of his own, personal, satellites at court, and although in attendance upon the king on a near daily basis, his influence never extended to the possession of any court office. Although he may have urged the king to make war upon the rebels, there is no evidence to substantiate the claim, made by Roger of Wendover, that des Roches was involved in a plot to murder Richard Marshal. The Marshal died fighting in Ireland in April 1234, by which time des Roches had already been banished from court. The vast cost of the civil war, compounded by the financial incompetence of Peter de Rivallis and by heavy expenditure on alliances in Brittany and Poitou intended to further the king's ambitions to reconquer his lost continental lordship, had led Henry to repudiate des Roches's counsel, and instead to incline to the policies now urged on him by Edmund of Abingdon (<i>d</i>. 1240), the newly elected archbishop of Canterbury, and the other English bishops.<br>
<br>At the start of April 1234 des Roches was ordered to leave court and to meddle no more in political affairs. Over the next few weeks his chief agent, Peter de Rivallis, was stripped of office, and was forced eventually to stand trial before the king. Des Roches was allowed to retire relatively unscathed, and in the spring of 1235 sought relief from his problems in England by a further series of adventures abroad, joining Pope Gregory IX (<i>r</i>. 1227&#150;41) and the emperor Frederick II in a campaign against the Roman commune. His relations with the emperor were soured by letters, sent by King Henry, warning Frederick against des Roches, while the pope is said to have favoured him only out of greed to obtain access to des Roches's vast wealth. In 1236, following representations from the pope, he received licence from Henry III to return to England; he is said to have arrived back about 29 September, broken in health, and one of his first acts was to draw up his will. During the last eighteen months of his life he was appointed to preach a crusade for the rescue of the Latin empire of Constantinople, helped quell disturbances at Oxford against the papal legate Otto, and, ironically, is said to have urged the king to favour his native barons against the newly introduced alien, Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. 1265). Des Roches died at his manor of Farnham on 9 June 1238. His heart was buried at nearby Waverley Abbey, his body in Winchester Cathedral, in a tomb still marked by a black marble effigy.<h2>
<a name="Bishopandpatron"></a>Bishop and patron</h2>For more than thirty years Peter des Roches exercised an influence over the Plantagenet court second only to that of the king. In general he appears to have favoured government through arbitrary royal will, as practised by King John. Such strong rule became increasingly unpopular in the new atmosphere brought about by <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and the prolonged minority of Henry III. As an alien exiled in England des Roches sought to keep alive the king's ambitions to reconquer the lands in France lost to the Capetian monarchy after 1203. However, it is not only as a politician but also as a diocesan bishop and as a patron of the religious that he deserves to be remembered. It was during his years as bishop that a new form of written record, the Winchester pipe rolls, was introduced to accounting procedure on the episcopal estates. Under his care the income of his estates was raised from some &pound;1500 to more than &pound;3000 a year. Building work at Winchester Cathedral, on the newly commissioned retrochoir, was continued, while des Roches himself supervised work at the royal castle of Winchester. He appears to have been the first bishop of Winchester to issue diocesan statutes, heavily influenced by the Lateran Council of 1215, and it was under his protection that the first band of Dominican preachers reached England in 1221. As a patron of the religious orders des Roches has few rivals in the thirteenth century. On his own initiative he founded Premonstratensian abbeys at Hales in Worcestershire and at Titchfield in Hampshire, an Augustinian priory at Selborne, and two Cistercian houses, at Netley in Hampshire and at Clart&eacute; Dieu, near his birthplace in the Touraine, funded after 1238 through bequests made in his will. In addition he presided over the refoundation of the hospital of St Thomas at Southwark, the re-establishment of the crusading hospital and order of St Thomas of Acre in the Holy Land, the introduction of the Dominicans to Winchester before 1234, and the establishment of a <i>domus Dei</i> or hospital at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>From his vast wealth Peter des Roches patronized hermits and anchoresses, and distributed large quantities of alms to the poor. The Winchester pipe rolls record his purchase of jewels, spices, and articles of precious metal, the bishop's devotion to hunting, and his patronage of a large number of clerks and knights, active on the fringes of the royal court. His episcopal household included several scholars, the poet Henry d'Avranches (<i>d</i>. 1262/3), the celebrated Master Elias of Dereham (<i>d</i>. 1245), and at least one and possibly two future bishops, Master Eustace de Fauconberg, bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1228), and Ralph Neville, royal chancellor and bishop of Chichester (<i>d</i>. 1244). Ironically, given his French upbringing and the fact that his alien birth was to prove so unpopular in England, des Roches appears to have been a keen patron of the Anglo-Saxon saints. He commissioned verses from Henry d'Avranches, intended to support the claims of Winchester in a dispute with Dorchester Abbey over possession of the relics of St Birinus. He also continued the remodelling of the east end of Winchester Cathedral and the refurbishment of the shrine of St Swithun. In 1231 he returned from crusade with a foot relic of St Philip, still preserved at Winchester at the time of the Reformation, and a book by William of Tyre on the marvels of the East which he gave to the chronicler Matthew Paris. Although the monks of Winchester are said to have found des Roches &#145;as hard as rocks&#146;, a pun upon Peter's name, he is known to have confirmed them in possession of tithes from their estates, and to have willed them property after his death. His will financed obituary celebrations across England and in the cathedral church at Tours. Des Roches also bequeathed a substantial estate in stock and seedcorn, to be held by the bishops of Winchester in perpetuity.<br>
