<span class="headword">Ware,  Hugh</span>  (1776&#150;1846), <span class="occ">officer in the French service</span>, was born near Rathcoffey, co. Kildare, on 19 January 1776. He was descended from the same family, of English origin, as Sir James Ware the historian. Hugh supported the Irish national movement, and was a member of the United Irishmen. On the outbreak of the 1798 uprising he raised a body of insurgents and maintained a desultory warfare in co. Kildare. After the battle of Vinegar Hill (21 June) he joined a detachment of defeated insurgents and retreated towards co. Meath. They were dispersed by government troops, but Ware and some of the other leaders were imprisoned, he at Dublin, then at Kilmainham until the peace of Amiens in 1802, when he was released on condition of voluntary banishment for life.<br>
<br>On his release Ware went to France, and in 1803, on the rupture of the peace of Amiens, obtained a lieutenancy in the new Irish legion in the French army. In 1804 he was appointed captain of grenadiers. After the breaking up of the camp at Boulogne, the legion served in the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany. Ware displayed undaunted courage on every occasion, and gained the respect of his superiors by his military talent. In 1810 the Irish regiment was sent into Spain, and it took part in the siege of Astorga. In June, at the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo by Ney, Ware was appointed by Junot to the command of an &eacute;lite battalion selected from his own regiment. He took part at the head of 900 men in a successful attack by General St Croix on the British outposts, and was promoted <i>chef de bataillon</i> (lieutenant-colonel).<br>
<br>After the Russian campaign of 1812 the Irish legion was transferred to Germany to reinforce the French army. Ware served successfully in the 1813 campaign. On 28 March he drove a party of cossacks out of Celle, inflicting heavy losses. Under General Puthod he took part in the French victories at Bautzen and Gros Warschen, which gained for Napoleon the truce of 4 June. During the armistice Ware received the cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In the battle of L&ouml;wenberg on 19 August the Irish regiment bore the brunt of the engagement, and Ware received three grapeshot wounds and had his horse killed under him. In the second battle of L&ouml;wenberg, two days later, the colonel of the regiment, William Lawless, had his leg taken off by a cannon shot, and command devolved upon Ware, who led the regiment over the Bobr in the face of the enemy. At the battle of Goldberg on 23 August he carried with the bayonet the hill of Goldberg, the key to the enemy's position, and had a second horse killed under him. At the conclusion of the action the French commander, General Lauriston, wrote from the field requesting for Ware the rank of colonel. On 29 August he saved the eagle of the regiment from capture. After the retreat from Leipzig, Ware took his regiment (reduced to ninety men) to the Netherlands, where the reserve battalion was stationed at Bois-le-Duc. He took part in the defence of Antwerp, and on 14 January 1814, at the head of 1000 men made a successful sortie against the British troops.<br>
<br>Napoleon, on his return from Elba, promoted Ware colonel. During the Belgian campaign the Irish regiment was in garrison at Montreuil, and after Waterloo it was disbanded. Ware retired to Tours, where he died on 5 March 1846. Ware was tall, &#145;of gigantic proportions&#146; and great strength  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 541), and was noted for his hospitality to English prisoners, whom he eagerly sought out during the Spanish campaigns.<br>
