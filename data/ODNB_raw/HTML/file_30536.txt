<span class="headword">Bain,  Robert Nisbet</span>  (1854&#150;1909), <span class="occ">translator and historian</span>, was born on 18 November 1854 in London, the eldest son of David Bain (<i>d</i>. after 1912), Cape and India merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Cowan of Liverpool. After education at private schools, he spent some years as a shorthand writer in the office of Messrs Henry Kimber &amp; Co., a firm of solicitors at 79 Lombard Street. From an early age Bain showed a talent for languages and an interest in literature. His aptitude for languages was useful when he entered the department of printed books in the British Museum as a second-class assistant in 1883; he easily headed the list of candidates in the entrance examination. In due course he was promoted to first-class assistant (the earlier designation of assistant keeper).<br>
<br>Besides his official duties at the British Museum, which mainly consisted of selecting and cataloguing books in the lesser-known languages of Europe (that is, Slavonic, Scandinavian, and Finno-Ugrian), Bain found the time for serious study of the history and literature of these countries. While on a visit to Germany in the early 1880s, he came across a novel. &#145;The unfamiliar name of the author attracted me, and when the obliging and erudite bookseller enlightened my ignorance &hellip; I pocketed the volume, curious to discover what a Magyar's idea of a good novel might be.&#146; After reading M&oacute;r J&oacute;kai's novel in German he &#145;there and then determined to learn Hungarian&#146; in order to be able to read J&oacute;kai's novels in the original  (Bain, 137). Bain followed up his momentary decision with great fortitude and became the most prolific translator of Hungarian fiction in the nineteenth century. Between 1891 and 1904 he translated nine full-length novels by J&oacute;kai and a volume of short stories, thereby being chiefly instrumental in introducing J&oacute;kai to the English reading public; some of his translations were in print for nearly twenty years in many editions. It was also via Hungarian that Bain translated the original Turkish folk-tales collected by Dr Ign&aacute;c Kunos (1896).<br>
<br>Bain also translated from other languages, including Finnish (short stories by Juhan Aho, 1893), Danish (stories by J. L. I. Lie, 1893, and a selection of Andersen's fairy tales, 1893, which he followed up by a sympathetic treatment of his life, <span class="italic">Hans Christian Andersen</span>, 1895), Russian (stories by Tolstoy and Maksim Gorky 1901 and 1902), and others.<br>
<br>As a translator, Bain admired colourful narrative and exotic background, hence his predilection for folk-tales and arch-Romantic novelists, like the Hungarian J&oacute;kai. He often took liberties with the original, abridging or condensing it freely, with the tacit approval, if not at the initiation, of his chief publisher, Messrs Jarrold. Contemporary critics were apt to notice this practice: &#145;The translation is fluent and at times, indeed, too free&#146; declared <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (20 February 1892) about his first rendering of J&oacute;kai into English.<br>
<br>Besides his literary work Bain's output of historical writing was also voluminous. Of this most is devoted to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Russian and Scandinavian history. Overviews of <span class="italic">Scandinavia, 1513&#150;1900</span> (1905) and of <span class="italic">Slavonic Europe, 1447&#150;1796</span> (1908) were published in the <span class="roman">Cambridge Historical Series</span>. Bain produced a volume on the rise of modern Russia under Peter the Great  (<span class="italic">The First Romanovs, 1613&#150;1728</span>, 1905) and other monographs of the same period. He contributed several chapters to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> (vols. 3, 5, 6, 11) on east European and Scandinavian history. His entries in the tenth and eleventh editions of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> on the same subjects, including well-written biographies of leading historical and literary figures, withstood the test of time for about half a century, most of them being rewritten or replaced only in the 1960 edition.<br>
<br>Bain was forty-two years old when on 29 July 1896 he married his cousin, Caroline Margaret Boswell Cowan (1862/3&#150;1909), daughter of Charles Cowan. In his youth Bain was a fairly good gymnast and lightweight boxer. He was a zealous high-churchman and in his later life he was for some years a sidesman and a regular attendant at St Alban's Church, Holborn. He travelled in Europe on several occasions, the last time in 1908 when he visited Germany and Switzerland for a few weeks' respite from his failing health. According to his contemporaries it was the constant hard work which characterized his whole life that was ultimately responsible for his premature death at the age of fifty-four on 5 May 1909 at 7 Overstrand Mansions, Battersea Park, but the official cause of death was stated to be heart failure and malignant disease of the liver. His burial took place in Brookwood cemetery on 8 May.<br>
