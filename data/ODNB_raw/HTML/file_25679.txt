<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skinner,  John</span>  (1744&#150;1816), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Aberdeen</span>, was born at Longside, Aberdeenshire, on 17 May 1744, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25678/', "Dean John Skinner (1721&#150;1807)")</script> of Linshart, Scottish Episcopal clergyman and poet, and his wife, Grissel Hunter (<i>c</i>.1719&#150;1799). The elder Skinner was a victim of the harsh anti-episcopalian laws introduced after the Jacobite rising of 1745 and young John shared his father's imprisonment in Old Aberdeen in 1753. After an early education at the parish schools of Longside and Echt (under his grandfather), he entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1757, leaving in 1761 to become private tutor to the grandson of Sir Hugh Paterson, bt, of Bannockburn, Stirlingshire, a Jacobite family. Skinner followed his father into the Scottish Episcopal church. Ordained deacon in 1763 and priest in 1764 by Andrew Gerard, bishop of Aberdeen, he was appointed in 1764 to the two charges of Ellon and Udny, Aberdeenshire. It was a successful ministry. In 1764 a new chapel for the episcopalians at Ellon was built at Bearnie; this was closed in 1776 and replaced by another new chapel at Tillydesk. A new chapel at Udny Green was built in 1764 and replaced with a chapel at Chapelhall four years later. In 1775 Skinner was chosen to succeed William Smith in charge of one of the two Episcopal congregations in Aberdeen, the focal point for nonjuring Anglicanism in north-east Scotland. Increased accommodation was soon required for his people; the upper floor of his new dwelling house in Longacre was converted into a chapel, holding over 500 people. On 25 September 1782 Skinner was consecrated in the chapel of Luthermuir, Kincardineshire, as coadjutor to Robert Kilgour, bishop of Aberdeen.<br>
<br>The young prelate quickly established himself as a force in the Scottish nonjuring church. Skinner's consecration coincided with the end of the American War of Independence, and the revival of plans for the appointment of a bishop to minister to Anglicans in the new United States. The plan of George Berkeley for the dispatch of a Scottish missionary bishop was dropped in favour of an American candidate, Samuel Seabury from Connecticut. Seabury's inconclusive negotiations with the English hierarchy persuaded him to approach Bishop Kilgour in August 1784. Assured by Berkeley that the archbishop of Canterbury privately had no objection to the proposed consecration, Skinner encouraged Kilgour to make a positive response in order to place the Church of England under an obligation to the Scots and give Episcopalians a renewed national prominence. Seabury was duly consecrated in the upper room of the house at Longacre on 14 November, with Skinner among the participating bishops and causing some consternation with a sermon which contrasted the &#145;acts of the apostles&#146; with &#145;acts of the British parliament&#146;. On 15 November the Scottish bishops, with Seabury, met in synod, and drew up eight articles of a &#145;concordate&#146; or bond of union between &#145;the catholic remainder of the ancient church of Scotland and the now rising church in Connecticut&#146;. The fifth article recommended to America the use of the Scottish communion office in preference to the service in the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>.<br>
<br>On Kilgour's resignation of the see (October 1786), Skinner was appointed bishop of Aberdeen; he was subsequently elected primus in December 1788, on Kilgour's resignation of that office. Not a Jacobite himself, Skinner was anxious to show his church's loyalty to the Hanoverian dynasty at the first opportunity and to achieve its political rehabilitation. He presided at a convocation of bishops, senior clergy, and laity at Aberdeen on 26 April 1788, when it was unanimously resolved that, in consequence of the death of Prince Charles Edward (31 January), the Scottish Episcopal clergy should, from 25 May, pray for George III as king, using the terms of the Anglican prayer book.<br>
<br>Skinner now bent his efforts to the removal of the penal laws still weighing heavily on his church. In early April 1789 he went to London with two other newly consecrated prelates, William Abernethy Drummond, bishop of Edinburgh, and John Strachan, bishop of Brechin, where they were cordially received by Archbishop Moore. Leading Scottish presbyterian divines, headed by William Robertson, favoured their claims, but Anglican clergy officiating in Scotland resisted the concession. A bill passed the Commons, but was lost in the Lords owing to Lord Chancellor Thurlow's intransigence. After returning to Scotland in July 1789, Skinner tried again. A committee was appointed in London to work for repeal of the penal laws, lobbying was undertaken by high-church sympathizers such as William Stevens, and parliament was petitioned by the royal burghs of Scotland in favour of a second <span class="roman">Relief Bill</span>, introduced in early 1792. Its success was ensured by Bishop Samuel Horsley's intervention, who had made the bill more acceptable to the Church of England by inserting a requirement of subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> from episcopalian clergy. The bill received the royal assent on 15 June 1792. Under its terms, the laity were left free from all penalties and civil disabilities unless they attended a chapel in which the reigning house was not prayed for; the clergy were bound to take an oath abjuring their past loyalty to the Jacobite cause, but unless ordained by a Church of England bishop they could not officiate south of the border. An episcopalian meeting at Laurencekirk (22 August) approved Skinner's action and agreed on voluntary adoption of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>.<br>
<br>Skinner wanted to unite all the Anglican congregations in Scotland into one body. He hoped to effect this by the appointment of Jonathan Boucher, vicar of Epsom and high-church American exile, as bishop of Edinburgh, but the scheme was abandoned, owing to the disquiet of the Episcopal clergy in the city ordained by English bishops, and the denial of open support from within the English hierarchy. Helped by Skinner's impeccable loyalism during the 1790s, relations between Scottish Anglicans continued to improve and terms of union in six articles were finally proposed on 24 October 1804 at a convocation of the clergy in Laurencekirk. These were gradually accepted (including subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>), with Skinner relieved that the Scottish communion office of 1764 had been retained.<br>
<br>In his own diocese Skinner was a hard-working prelate. At Aberdeen he built a new chapel in 1792, and laid the foundations of St Andrew's Church in 1816. Diocesan meetings of his clergy were revived from 1784; at first biannual, they were held yearly from 1792. Skinner delivered no fewer than thirty-six Episcopal charges. They <i>inter alia</i> gave expression to the Hutchinsonian views he inherited from his father, and which he shared with such friends as Boucher. He was the commanding presence in his church, and he dominated the college of bishops. Excessively so for some, one church member describing him as a &#145;dictator&#146;  (M. Irvine to G. Ogilvie of Auchiries, 23 Oct 1794, Aberdeen University Library, Ogilvie-Forbes of Boyndlie MSS, 2740). But he revised the code of canons of the church at the 1811 general synod and also secured primary authority for the Scottish communion office, fearing that it would fall into disuse if attempts continued &#145;to assimilate our divine Service in every the minutest article to that of the Church of England&#146;  (Aberdeen University Library, MS 3320/6/87, &#145;Thoughts on the English liturgy&#146;, 40). Yet careful Anglicizer that he was, Bishop Skinner also made sure that congregations preferring the English prayer book office could freely use it.<br>
<br>Skinner's leadership of the Scottish Episcopal church did not preclude extensive theological activity. Many of his sermons were published in his lifetime including that preached at Bishop Seabury's consecration, which emphasized that the church drew its authority from Christ through the apostolic succession of its ministry. In 1786 he produced <span class="italic">A Course of Lectures</span> intended to instruct lay members; the lectures convey Skinner's moderate high-churchmanship and his strong sacramentalism: &#145;the bread and the cup are made unto us, and do become in power and efficacy, the body and blood of Christ&#146;  (p. 133). The primus's concern &#145;to exact a conformity with the ancient standards of Eucharistic service&#146;  (Dowden, <span class="italic">Scottish Communion Office</span>, 98) endeared him to high Anglicans such as Berkeley, Horsley, and George Horne in England who were warm admirers of the anti-Erastian character of Skinner's church. Skinner defended his church's high regard for apostolicity against his fellow Aberdonian, George Campbell, in <span class="italic">Primitive Truth and Order Vindicated</span> (1803). He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>, but on theological rather than overtly political matters.<br>
<br>Skinner married (between 28 August and 12 September 1765) Mary (<i>d</i>. 1807), a daughter of the Revd William Robertson. Two of their sons, the eldest, <a href="#cosubject_25681">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25690/', "William Skinner (1778&#150;1857)")</script>, his father's successor in the Aberdeen diocese, survived infancy, along with two daughters. Mary Skinner died on 4 March 1807. John died of a hernia on 13 July 1816, and was buried on 19 July in the Spital churchyard, Aberdeen. His record of achievement still makes it hard to quarrel with William Walker's claim that Skinner was &#145;the greatest Bishop of the Scottish post-revolution episcopal church&#146;  (Walker, 253).<br>

<a name="cosubject_25681"></a><span class="headword">John Skinner</span>  (1769&#150;1841), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal clergyman</span>, was born on 20 August 1769, educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and ordained in 1790. After serving as Episcopal clergyman at Banff he was rector of Forfar for forty-five years and became dean of Dunkeld and Dunblane. Skinner contributed to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin</span> in the 1790s. He was a supporter of allowing laymen to assume greater importance in running the church. His <span class="italic">Annals of Scottish Episcopacy, from the Year 1788 to the Year 1816</span> (1818) includes a memoir of his father.
