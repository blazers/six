<span class="headword">Chermayeff <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Issakovitch]</span>,  Sergius Ivan <span class="st"> [Serge]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1996), <span class="occ">designer and architect</span>, was born Sergius Ivanovich Issakovitch in Grozny, Chechnya, Russia (though at the time of his naturalization as a British subject he gave his birth place as Odessa), on 8 October 1900, the only son and younger child of Ivan Akimovitch Issakovitch, banker and landowner, and his wife, Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sonnschein. The family name revealed their Jewish origins, from which Serge distanced himself when he changed his name by deed poll in 1924. Oil finds on their land had made the family wealthy from the 1890s onwards, and Serge and his sister were educated by governesses of different nationalities before he was sent to Peterborough Lodge School in Hampstead, London, in 1910. His education continued at Harrow School up to 1918, by which time the family property had been lost in the revolution. He spent four years working as a journalist and illustrator, and later a full-time professional ballroom dancer in London, with a two-year spell in Argentina, partly on a ranch, and partly as a partner in a dance hall in Buenos Aires. On returning to London in 1924, he not only changed his name but began his career in design, developing his early talent for drawing. In 1927 he met his future wife, Barbara Maitland May (1904&#150;2000), daughter of Frank Maitland May, contractor. They were married on 22 March 1928, shortly after he had taken British nationality. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Through his wife's connections Chermayeff was introduced to Lord Waring, who employed him to head the London office of the modern art department of Waring and Gillow, in association with Paul Follot in the Paris branch. The exhibition of &#145;Modern Art in French and English Furniture and Decoration&#146; (1928&#150;9) occupied a whole floor of the Oxford Street premises, with sixty display rooms, including furniture and textiles designed by Chermayeff and his small but talented staff. This was modernism deliberately tempered for English taste, and was widely acclaimed. The interiors of the Cambridge Theatre, Seven Dials, London, are the most substantial remaining example of this phase of his work. Chermayeff soon made contacts among the small group of enthusiasts for modern design, and moved towards a less luxurious style in interiors for Broadcasting House, London, in 1932, and for a prototype Week End House exhibited in 1933, furnished with a range of standard chairs and units marketed by PLAN Ltd, largely derived from German models.<br>
<br>In 1933 Chermayeff, who had recently been accepted as a fellow of the RIBA, went into partnership with Erich Mendelsohn (1887&#150;1953), a refugee from Nazism. They won the competition for the De La Warr Pavilion at Bexhill, Sussex, to which Chermayeff contributed the interior design and for which he developed Mendelsohn's original plan concept. It was the first large public building of the modern movement in England and attracted considerable attention. Two houses, Shrub's Wood, Chalfont St Giles (1934&#150;5), and 64 Old Church Street, Chelsea (1935&#150;6), were also built, and a number of speculative designs prepared, before the dissolution of the partnership at the end of 1936. Chermayeff practised on his own as an architect until 1939, building Gilbey House, Oval Road, Camden Town (1937), and the new research laboratories at Blackley, Manchester, for the dyestuffs division of ICI (1938). His own house, Bentley Wood, Halland, Sussex (1938), was widely admired for its simple timber structure, responding to the landscape and containing works of art by Henry Moore, John Piper, and Ben Nicholson.<br>
<br>In the later 1930s Chermayeff saw himself increasingly in the role of architectural teacher and theorist. He was a frequent public speaker and had considerable ability in debate. Like many of his architect contemporaries, he believed in an inherent connection between a modern approach to design and the achievement of social justice combined with technological progress. His own design work, which had character rather than personal stylistic expression, helped to demonstrate these ideals. His friends were mainly scientists and artists.<br>
<br>Chermayeff's personal bankruptcy in 1939 led him to seek a new career in the USA. In 1940 he, his wife, and their two sons crossed the Atlantic, and by the autumn had settled in the San Francisco area, where he became involved with architecture, journalism, and lecturing. In 1943 he was appointed chairman of the new design department at Brooklyn College, New York, where he created a comprehensive new course, broadly based on the principles of the pre-war German Bauhaus. In 1947 (the year after the Chermayeff family became American citizens) he became president of the Institute of Design in Chicago, in succession to L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, who had opened the school as &#145;The New Bauhaus&#146;. With increased enrolment of former servicemen on grants, the institute flourished as a centre for radical education and research, in which architecture was combined with other disciplines. The need to affiliate with a larger and more established body led in 1951 to a merger with the Illinois Institute of Technology, where the ethos was less liberal. Chermayeff found his position untenable and resigned.<br>
<br>After a year of teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chermayeff was engaged by the graduate school of design at Harvard University, where he taught first-year students, putting them through a rapid and rigorous introduction to a range of topics which he called &#145;environmental design&#146;. His goal of a socially conscious and beneficial architecture depended on avoidance of over-specialization, something which his own lack of professional training may have helped him to understand. Despite a broad acceptance of modernism, the tendency in the USA in this period was in the opposite direction, towards self-consciously architectural statements. With his lifelong concern for the design of houses, Chermayeff channelled his energy to the problem of the American suburbs, working with students to produce models for single-storey courtyard houses which achieved privacy and excluded noise, allowing a new means of inhabiting the inner suburbs and preventing migration away from city centres. These solutions and their broader justifications were presented in the book <span class="italic">Community and Privacy</span> (1963), which he wrote jointly with Christopher Alexander, and which was widely noticed around the world. It included early examples of the application of computers to the solution of design problems.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1950s Chermayeff wanted to pursue further research with graduate students, but was not given opportunities to do so at Harvard. He offered himself to Paul Rudolph, the new dean of the school of arts and architecture at Yale University, and began teaching there at the beginning of 1962, where his first class included the young British students Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Chermayeff's work at Yale was on the scale of the city and region. Problems were examined in abstract terms, informed by the new disciplines of systems theory and cybernetics, and cities were seen in terms of flows and their points of connection and transition. Thus the relationship between architecture and science which Chermayeff pursued in Britain in the 1930s resulted not only in technical means but in new patterns of cognition and understanding of the relationship between human behaviour and the natural environment. The book <span class="italic">Shape of Community</span>, which Chermayeff and his co-author Alexander Tzonis published in 1971, was a summation of this work, expressing grave concerns for the direction in which the civilized world was heading.<br>
<br>During his years in America, Chermayeff was too fully occupied in teaching and writing to have much time for practising architecture, although he was ambivalent about whether he would have wished to work on the same scale as before the war. His buildings included two houses in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1940s, which showed a loosening of his formal language, and a series of holiday houses on Cape Cod. In 1943 he began building a small cabin in a woodland area overlooking Slough Pond, near Wellfleet. After several extensions, this became his permanent home in 1973. His own studio near the house, and commissions for two other clients near by, developed an idiosyncratic decorative use of diagonal timber framing with brightly coloured infill panels, while a house for the writer Edwin O'Connor (1956) was plainer but still well adapted to seaside holiday needs. The Payson house at Falmouth Harbour, Portland, Maine (1952), showed Chermayeff's understanding of planning and practical functions brought to the level of fine art by sensitivity to the site and the inclusion of a unified colour scheme running from the exterior through to the furnishings.<br>
<br>Chermayeff was tall and handsome, with a large head and prominent nose. His manner was often disconcertingly abrupt, and he always spoke his mind regardless of the consequences. Students and colleagues sometimes suffered undeservedly, but recognized that the purpose was to dispel egotism and open up fresh possibilities of understanding. He was always proud of the achievements of his sons, Ivan and Peter, in design and architecture. He produced a number of paintings and drawings, during his years in Chicago and in retirement, which were exhibited. He also published some poetry. After 1980 he ceased to travel widely and became reclusive, hampered by increasing deafness. He organized the deposit of his archives at the Avery Library, Columbia University, New York, although much of his pre-war material had been lost when bombed in storage in London in 1940. He died at Wellfleet, Cape Cod, on 6 May 1996. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their two sons.<br>
