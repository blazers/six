<span class="headword">Coterel,  James</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1328&#150;1351), <span class="occ">gang leader</span>, is assumed to have been a younger son of Ralph Coterel, a landowner in Cromford, Matlock, Tadington, and three other places in Derbyshire, who was dead by 1315. In his youth James was the leader of a gang that included his brothers John and Nicholas and also had links with other groups of criminals including that led by Eustace Folville. Nicholas Coterel's pardon as one of Thomas of Lancaster's adherents in April 1322, and the group's close link to members of the Bradbourn family who had also been among the earl's followers, indicates an affiliation to the opposition of Edward II's rule. John Kinnersley, a canon of Lichfield later accused of supporting the Coterels, had been a member of Thomas of Lancaster's council, and Richard Rolleston of Crich, one of their receivers, had probably been one of the earl's bailiffs. But although the Coterels' career of violence and crime began with the breakdown of Edward II's government, there are no indications of a political motive. By 1330 they had been accused of having pillaged estates of Henry, earl of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1345), in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, and of having committed two murders, and they had already formed associations with other criminals.<br>
<br>Between 1330 and 1332 James Coterel led a ring of gangs involved in murder, kidnapping, and extortion in the Peak District and northern Nottinghamshire. Despite his own attachment for murder at the Derbyshire eyre of 1330, and the outlawry of his associates in March 1331, Coterel was never arrested. This was due to the support he received in the area, especially from two religious communities, the dean and chapter of Lichfield and the priory of Lenton, Nottinghamshire. When a powerful commission of trailbaston justices, led by the chief justices of king's bench and common pleas, visited the midlands in 1332, he escaped arrest because he was warned by the prior of Lenton. The canons of Lichfield were repeatedly mentioned as receivers of Coterel's gang. This close connection with the dean and chapter of Lichfield, as well as with the Cluniac priory of Lenton, illustrates Coterel's standing in the High Peak District, where both these religious communities had previously clashed over conflicting claims to advowsons and tithes. James Coterel also benefited from Queen Philippa's patronage more than once. Through her influence he was able to purchase the wardship of a mill in Wormhill and lands in Tideswell in 1332&#151;he still had property interests in the latter manor in 1339. When he received a pardon in 1351 it was again at the queen's request. It is likely that he obtained this support because Nicholas Coterel was bailiff of the queen's liberty in Derbyshire and Leicestershire, though Nicholas did not acquit himself well in that office, since he was summoned before the king's council to answer a charge of embezzlement in 1359. Although James Coterel repeatedly acted as tax collector for Lenton Priory in his later career, and was even entrusted with one arrest warrant in 1336 and another in 1350, when he and six others were instructed to find and capture three monks of Lenton who had left the priory, he still felt it necessary to obtain a pardon for extortions, oppressions, receivings of felons, usurpations, and ransoms in 1351. Nicholas Coterel was still alive in 1363, when the recognizance of a debt of &pound;132 which he owed to John Folville and Robert Harrington was entered upon the close rolls, but the date of James's death is unknown.<br>
