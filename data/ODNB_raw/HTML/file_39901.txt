<span class="headword">Arnold,  Denis Midgley</span>  (1926&#150;1986), <span class="occ">musicologist</span>, was born on 15 December 1926 in Sheffield, the only son and younger child of Charles Arnold, company director, and his wife, Bertha Ball. He was educated at High Storrs grammar school in Sheffield, and at Sheffield University. He graduated BA in 1947 and BMus in 1948, and received an MA in 1950 for a dissertation on the early seventeenth-century musician Thomas Weelkes, partly written during service in the Royal Air Force. In 1951 he married Elsie Millicent, a trained musicologist, daughter of John William Dawrant, schoolmaster, of Liverpool. They had two sons.<br>
<br>The orientation of Arnold's life's work as a musicologist was determined by the award in 1950 of an Italian government scholarship enabling him to go to Bologna to study Italian music of the years about 1600. In 1951 he was appointed lecturer in music (reader in 1960) in the department of adult education at the Queen's University, Belfast; he also worked for the music department. Arnold's experience in adult education confirmed another of his conspicuous qualities: his powers as an educator and communicator, addressing widely varying audiences in plain language and with engaging enthusiasm. This stance, moreover, informs all his writings, even the most specialized. It was during his years in Belfast that he began publishing the stream of articles in learned journals that continued up to his death. Through them he quickly made a name as a major scholar on the music (mainly secular vocal) of late Renaissance and early baroque Italy, and as one of Britain's leading musicologists&#151;a reputation reinforced by his many editions of the music itself.<br>
<br>In 1964 Arnold moved as senior lecturer in music to the University of Hull at about the time he published his first book, the <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> volume on Monteverdi (1963). He was joint editor of, and a contributor to, the <span class="italic">Monteverdi Companion</span> (1968; new edn as <span class="italic">The New Monteverdi Companion</span>, 1985) and, perhaps surprisingly, the <span class="italic">Beethoven Companion</span> (1971). It was natural that he should welcome the chance to communicate with a potentially larger readership through a series of short studies of composers with whom he was particularly identified: <span class="italic">Marenzio</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Monteverdi Madrigals</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Giovanni Gabrieli</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Monteverdi Church Music</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">Gesualdo</span> (1984), as well as <span class="italic">Bach</span> (1984).<br>
<br>In 1969 Arnold became professor of music at the University of Nottingham and from 1975 until his death in 1986 was Heather professor of music at the University of Oxford. He had always been a keen conductor, and he threw himself into performance at both universities with renewed zeal. He increasingly became a public figure on a wider scale too. For many years he toiled as editor of, and contributor to, the <span class="italic">New Oxford Companion to Music</span> (2 vols., 1983); he was president of the Royal Musical Association (1978&#150;83) and British representative on the directorium of the International Musicological Society (IMS) from 1978 until his death; and he served as chairman of the Oxford Playhouse and the music panel of Southern Arts. Amid this activity he wrote his largest study, <span class="italic">Giovanni Gabrieli and the Music of the Venetian High Renaissance</span> (1979), and, with his wife, <span class="italic">The Oratorio in Venice</span> (1986), the fruit of an increasing interest in his later years in Italian&#151;especially Venetian&#151;music of the century and a half after the period on which he concentrated for much of his career.<br>
<br>Arnold was short of stature but in every other respect a &#145;big&#146; man: ebullient, generous, and gregarious, as well as informal and unpretentious; an industrious scholar who produced eminently approachable books and practical editions which helped transform the general view of music and its contexts in Italy in the age of Gabrieli and Monteverdi. All were based on solid research: a public figure in his element as lecturer, conductor, or conference-goer, he was perhaps never happier than when working in libraries and archives, especially in his beloved Venice.<br>
<br>Arnold was an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (1971) and Royal College of Music (1981). He became an FBA and an honorary foreign member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome (both 1976), and in 1977 he was awarded the Premio Internazionale Galileo Galilei dei Rotary Italiani at Pisa University for services to the study of Italian music. In 1980 the honorary degree of DMus was conferred on him by two universities, Sheffield and Queen's, Belfast, and in 1983 he was appointed CBE. Arnold died suddenly of a heart attack on 28 April 1986 in Budapest while representing Britain at a meeting of the directorium of the IMS.<br>
