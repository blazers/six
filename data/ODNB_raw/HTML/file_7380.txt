<span class="headword">Deacon,  William Frederick</span>  (1799&#150;1845), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 26 July 1799 in Caroline Place, Mecklenburgh Square, Bloomsbury, London, the eldest son of William Wranius Deacon, a wealthy merchant, and Caroline Harriet Clayton. At the age of eleven he was sent to Reading School, where the celebrated Dr Richard Valpy instilled in him a love of literature. His senior schoolfellow Thomas Noon Talfourd remembered Deacon as &#145;tall for his age and naturally graceful, with dark eyes and dirty hands; gay, light-hearted and heedless&#146;  (Talfourd, 7). He was apt to neglect lessons for novel-reading and this tendency followed him to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a pensioner in June 1817. He did not reside at Trinity and in the following October he migrated to St Catharine's College and soon, according to Talfourd, became known for his &#145;fine taste and conversational powers&#146;. He was already composing verse and in 1817 found a publisher in William Hone for <span class="italic">Hacho, or, The Spell of St. Wilten</span>, a long poem influenced by Sir Walter Scott, which sold well.<br>
<br>Deacon later regretted the &#145;irregularities&#146; at Cambridge that resulted in his being sent down, and on returning to London he encountered strong disapproval from his father. With this failure went Deacon's hopes of taking holy orders and instead he resolved to enter on a literary career. An annuity of &pound;100 from his grandmother gave him a degree of freedom, and while living in the family home he sought out publishers. He eventually found one in 1820, when the newly established partnership of Joyce Gold and William Northhouse launched its <span class="italic">London Magazine and Monthly Critical and Dramatic Review</span> as a rival to the better-known <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> of Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, which was edited by John Scott. Deacon's connection with Gold's journal probably dates from the first appearance of the Alchymist feature in March 1820, but he may have contributed articles from the outset, in January. From April 1820 until the magazine folded in mid-1821 he was its sheet anchor, contributing to its pages romantic tales, verse, literary criticism, serio-comic sketches, and parodies under his initials (W. F. D) or using a variety of pseudonyms, including Greville Faulkland, Sam Quiz, and Paul Clutterbuck. Although usually a sound critic, he was less gifted as a writer of romantic fiction and verse, where his immaturity is apparent, but his parodies were mostly accurate and some of them found their way into Deacon's acclaimed <span class="italic">Warreniana</span> (1824). Of his sketches the best are autobiographical and show the writer drawing heavily on his experiences in and around Reading. &#145;A day at the mill&#146;, for instance, describes Three Mile Cross and interestingly predates by over six months the first sketch by Mary Russell Mitford in her &#145;Our Village&#146; series.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1820 Deacon launched the <span class="italic">D&eacute;jeun&eacute;, or, Companion for the Breakfast Table</span>, a daily miscellany costing 2<i>d</i>. which was modelled on Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">Indicator</span>. This venture represented a large commitment for Deacon, who was probably the magazine's sole contributor. The strain told and on 15 December the <span class="italic">D&eacute;jeun&eacute;</span> became a thrice-weekly publication and soon afterwards ceased. With the merging in February 1821 of Gold's <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> with the <span class="italic">Theatrical Inquisitor</span> Deacon's stint as editor very possibly began. By June, however, a &#145;sudden and severe illness&#146; had forced him to retire and in the following month the journal was bought out by Taylor and Hessey, the new owners of Baldwin's <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>. Deacon meanwhile had taken a small cottage near Llangadog in Carmarthenshire, and here he amused himself for several months &#145;with a few old books and a daily ramble among the Black Mountains&#146;  (Deacon, <span class="italic">The Innkeeper's Album</span>, 424). From Llangadog he wrote to his hero Sir Walter Scott asking for advice and guidance and enclosing samples of his work. In reply Scott praised his writing but strongly recommended that he exchange the insecure and penurious life of a journalist for one of honest toil in a counting-house, according to his father's wishes.<br>
<br>By now Deacon was contemplating a new life in South America, but a partial reconciliation with his father left him free to pursue literature as a career. He became interested in Welsh folklore and for a short while may have been the schoolmaster at Llanwrda, not far from Llangadog. Before long he had returned to London and by late December 1822 was living in Chelsea. In this period he became friendly with the historian Charles Mills, with whom he had much in common, and his first book, <span class="italic">The Innkeeper's Album</span> (1823), a collection of sketches inspired by his stay in Wales, is dedicated to him. Deacon's next volume, <span class="italic">Warreniana</span> (1824), was a series of parodies of his contemporaries, including Coleridge, Byron, Scott, and Hunt, in the style of <span class="italic">Rejected Addresses</span>, and it proved enormously popular. A further collection of tales and sketches, many with a Welsh setting, appeared in 1826 as <span class="italic">November Nights</span>.<br>
<br>The loss of his annuity in 1829 drove Deacon to depend entirely on his literary efforts. After a short period as an assistant in a school at Dulwich he was without work for a while before joining <span class="italic">The Sun</span> newspaper as a contributor to its literary criticism. He soon gained a reputation as a critic of taste and scholarship and he became an early champion of Dickens. His own first novel, the two-volume <span class="italic">Exile of Erin</span> (1835), contained satirical portraits of prominent Irish patriots, such as O'Connell, and was well received both at home and in the United States. Between 1837 and 1839 he wrote a series of papers for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> under the heading &#145;The Picture Gallery&#146; (which were much in the style of his earlier sketches), and in doing so realized a long-standing ambition to contribute to a journal he had always admired. These papers were collected in book form in 1858. About 1840 he was appointed editor of <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, but the extra responsibility weakened an already delicate constitution. He died in London surrounded by his wife Alice and their three children at his home, 2 Malvern Terrace, Islington, on 18 March 1845. He left behind him the manuscript of <span class="italic">Annette</span>, a novel which was published in three volumes in 1853, with a prefatory memoir by Sir T. N. Talfourd.<br>
