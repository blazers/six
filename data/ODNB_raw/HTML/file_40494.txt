<span class="headword">Jacson,  Maria Elizabetha</span>  (1755&#150;1829), <span class="occ">writer on botany</span>, was born at Bebington, Cheshire, the daughter of the Revd Simon Jacson and Anne Fitzherbert. Her family had held land and clerical livings in Cheshire and Derbyshire since the early seventeenth century; Maria grew up in the rectory at Bebington, then lived with her widowed father, privately in Stockport in 1777&#150;87, and later in the rectory at Tarporley, Cheshire. Neither Maria nor her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40495/', "Frances Jacson")</script>, a novelist, married. After the death of their father in 1808 the sisters lived in Somersal Hall, an Elizabethan manor house, in Somersal Herbert, Derbyshire, which belonged to a maternal relative.<br>
<br>Maria Jacson had family connections to Enlightenment science culture in the midlands through Erasmus Darwin and her cousin Sir Brooke Boothby of Ashbourne, Derbyshire. Her interest in plants showed itself early in botanical drawing, gardening, and experiments in plant physiology. In 1788 she gave a drawing of a Venus's fly-trap to Darwin, who described her as &#145;a lady who adds much botanical knowledge to many other elegant acquirements&#146;  (Shteir, 114&#150;15). When she was forty-two, induced by family financial circumstances, Maria Jacson began writing for money, and published her first book, <span class="italic">Botanical Dialogues, between Hortensia and her Four Children</span> (1797). An introduction to Linnaean botany &#145;for the use of schools&#146;, it takes the form of conversations within a family. The book features a mother who believes in the mental and moral utility of botanical knowledge. Hortensia teaches her children about the Linnaean system of classifying and naming plants, and instructs them about dissecting flowers and examining them under the microscope. In a commendatory note included in the book, Darwin and Boothby praised the author for &#145;so accurately explaining a difficult science in an easy and familiar manner&#146;. While reviews of the book noted the clarity and elegance of Jacson's exposition, <span class="italic">Botanical Dialogues</span> was too learned for the juvenile market, and did not go past the first edition.<br>
<br>Probably more a botanist than an educator, Jacson recast her material into a book for general adult readers, under the title <span class="italic">Botanical Lectures</span> (1804). Shorn of the conversational form and family setting of the earlier title, this book promoted the importance of learning botany from the proper sources and using Latin botanical nomenclature. In the &#145;Advertisement&#146; Jacson styled her book &#145;a complete elementary system, which may enable the student of whatever age to surmount those difficulties, which hitherto have too frequently impeded the perfect acquirement of this interesting science&#146;. She situated her own work as introductory to the translation of Linnaeus's <span class="italic">System of Vegetables</span> (1783) by Erasmus Darwin and the Botanical Society of Lichfield. Jacson's third book, <span class="italic">Sketches of the Physiology of Vegetable Life</span> (1811), mirrored a shift in focus within early nineteenth-century botany from classification and nomenclature to plant structure and function, and was intended for younger students of physiology. The book reflects wide reading in contemporary botanical literature, as Jacson explores topics such as plant motion, propagation, and analogies between plant and animal functions. She exhorts readers to see for themselves, and describes experiments she conducted on crocus bulbs; her own drawings illustrate the development of bulbs and seeds.<br>
<br>Jacson's books clearly sought to enlarge female education. Nevertheless, the maternal teacher in <span class="italic">Botanical Dialogues</span> declares that women should:<blockquote>avoid obtruding their knowledge upon the public. The world have agreed to condemn women to the exercise of their fingers, in preference to that of their heads; and a woman rarely does herself credit by coming forward as a literary character. (238)</blockquote>Science books by women were an emergent feature of publishing at the turn of the nineteenth century, and reviewers commented favourably on female author&#150;educators. At the same time, learned women were suspect, and social conventions about female modesty often led women to publish anonymously and to make careful, strategic claims about their expertise. Jacson's books are identified only as &#145;by a Lady&#146; or &#145;by the Authoress&#146;, or with the initials M. E. J.<br>
<br>In addition to her popular botanical writing, Jacson was an early female horticultural writer, preceding the better-known Jane Loudon by several decades. Her <span class="italic">Florist's manual: hints for the construction of a gay flower-garden with observations on the best method of preventing the depredations of insects</span> (1816) was directed to women flower growers. Jacson seeks to &#145;render my sister Florists partakers of my pleasures&#146; to &#145;enable them more methodically to arrange their flowers, and so to blend their colours, that through most part of the spring and summer months they may procure a succession of enamelled borders&#146;  (<span class="italic">Florist's Manual</span>, 1816, 3&#150;4). The book discusses garden design, including the shape of flowerbeds and placement of a rockery, recommends &#145;mingled&#146; or mixed beds, and gives a catalogue of suitable herbaceous flowers, bulbs, and grasses. She encourages readers to have a conservatory for spring bulbs. Jacson suggests in her concluding remarks that women can find both horticultural and personal benefit in botany, and hopes to &#145;induce even a few of my sister Florists to exercise their intellect, or relieve their ennui&#146; through &#145;the study of vegetable existence&#146;. <span class="italic">Florist's Manual</span> was Jacson's most successful work; a second, enlarged edition was published with coloured plates in 1822, and a subsequent edition in 1827. John Claudius Loudon cited from it at several points in his <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Gardening</span>.<br>
<br>Little is known about Maria Jacson's social circle in later years. Maria Edgeworth recalls meeting the &#145;gay garden lady&#146; in Lichfield in 1818  (Colvin, 141). Jacson died of a fever at Astle Hall, near Chelford, Cheshire, on 10 October 1829, and was buried at Chelford.<br>
