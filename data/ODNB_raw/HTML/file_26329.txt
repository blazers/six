<span class="headword">Staveley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1626, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at East Langton, Leicestershire, and baptized at the neighbouring parish of Church Langton on 26 November 1626, the eldest of twelve children of William Staveley (1596&#150;1652), rector of Cossington, Leicestershire, and his wife, Anne (1605&#150;1680), daughter of Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, and his wife, Catherine. He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 14 April 1644 and to the Inner Temple on 2 July 1647. He was called to the bar in 1654.<br>
<br>In 1656 Staveley married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1669), the daughter of John Onebye of Hinckley, Leicestershire. Their children included Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1676), William (1662&#150;1723), and George (1665&#150;1709), later rector of Medbourne, Leicestershire. Staveley lived for all but the last six or seven years of his life at the parsonage in Belgrave, Leicestershire, and his wife was buried in the church there on 12 October 1669. He practised the law, serving as a magistrate and, in succession to his father-in-law, as steward to Leicester corporation from 1662.<br>
<br>Staveley's only publication during his lifetime was politically inspired: <span class="italic">The Romish horseleech, or, An impartial account of the intolerable change of popery to this nation</span> (1674) was published anonymously, with a provocative title supplied by others, and with <span class="italic">An Essay of the Supremacy of the King of England</span> annexed; ironically, his son William became a Roman Catholic. However, his abiding interest was in antiquarian research. His <span class="italic">History of Churches in England</span> was eventually published in 1712 and much of his research, which survives in part as a manuscript history of Leicester  (BL, Add. MS 15917, and Leics. RO), was largely incorporated by John Nichols in his <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span> and <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester</span>. Staveley was well liked and regarded as honest in his legal work. He was mild-mannered despite occasional fits of gout. &#145;Having passed the latter part of his life in the study of English history, he acquired a melancholy habit; but was esteemed a diligent, judicious, and faithful Antiquary&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities</span>, 2.2.677). Staveley died at his house in Friar Lane, Leicester, on 2 January 1684 and was buried in the church of St Mary de Castro, Leicester, on 8 January 1684.<br>
