<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benson, Sir  Francis Robert <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1858&#150;1939), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born at Eden House, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 4 November 1858, the third son and fourth child of William Benson (1816&#150;1887), a barrister and justice of the peace of Alresford, Hampshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Soulsby (<i>d</i>. 1892), the daughter of Thomas Smith of Colebrooke Park, Tonbridge. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37182/', "William Arthur Smith Benson")</script>, the designer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30715/', "Godfrey Rathbone Benson, later Baron Charnwood")</script>, were among his brothers.<h2>
<a name="Youthfulsportsandacting"></a>Youthful sports and acting</h2>Although Benson claimed viking ancestry, his family is traceable to eighteenth-century Quakers. He spent an idyllic, rural childhood before attending Darch's Preparatory School in Brighton (from 1867). In 1871 he went to Winchester College, where he preferred sports to academics, but was attracted to Shakespeare and played female roles. Sports still predominated when he went to New College, Oxford, in 1878, but he created a stir in 1880 when he mounted a successful production of Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span>. Presented in Greek and with Benson as Clytemnestra, the production was repeated for three performances at St George's Hall, London, an enterprise witnessed by Henry Irving and Ellen Terry (the latter particularly fostered Benson's early career). His Oxford days were also typified by his triumph in winning the inter-varsity 3 mile race against Cambridge in 1881 in fifteen minutes and five seconds.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> persuaded Benson his future lay in the theatre and, on leaving Oxford, he presented <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> for a single performance at the Imperial Theatre, London, in July 1881. In addition to playing Romeo, Benson attempted to manage every aspect of the production. The result was amateurish and financially disastrous, although some perceived histrionic potential in Benson himself. Indeed, this early effort epitomizes Benson's whole career: his own limited acting and managerial capabilities, his abundant enthusiasm, and his ensuing financial woes, which resulted in someone else bailing him out. On this occasion his father provided &pound;500, an act he was to repeat frequently.<br>
<br>Benson's determination to become a professional actor was founded on a minimal understanding of acting or of the theatre, but he possessed an almost arrogant conviction he could improve conditions. However, for a few months he did study stage-fighting, dancing, boxing, and elocution with various tutors, notably Hermann Vezin, the last in an attempt to improve his always problematic voice. Then, in June 1882, the supportive Ellen Terry invited him to participate in a private reading of <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, with Irving as Benedick, Helen Faucit as Beatrice, and Benson as Don Pedro.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Benson obtained his first professional engagement, playing Paris in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> with Irving and Terry at the Lyceum Theatre (2 September 1882). His performance, despite Benson's own confidence, was inauspicious, and Terry had to persuade Irving to retain him. When no further roles materialized, Benson was told he would profit from working with a provincial touring company, advice which fundamentally dictated the remainder of his career.<h2>
<a name="Foundinghisowncompany"></a>Founding his own company</h2>Benson joined the Manchester Shakespearian company of Charles Bernard and Annie Alleyn in December 1882. After a few weeks' trial he failed to impress and was advised to quit the stage. Undeterred, early in 1883 he joined Walter Bentley's touring company, which performed Shakespeare and classic comedies in the north of England and Scotland. After a few months Bentley decamped for financial reasons, and Benson, still the novice, arrogantly took over the company, although not without his father's substantial financial assistance. The new F. R. Benson company began its first tour on 5 May 1883 at the Public Hall in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, still presenting Shakespeare and old comedies. The tour eventually lost &pound;450. However, Benson did attempt some innovations, largely as a result of seeing the Meiningen company at Drury Lane in 1881. Although circumstances made application of the Meiningen theories difficult, he tried to present concerted scenes, ensemble acting, and a coherent stage picture. During his career he became notorious for conducting protracted rehearsals, oblivious to the needs of ordinary mortals. His objectives were to perform constantly as many of Shakespeare's plays as possible, changing the programme frequently so that no play predominated. Additionally, his actors were trained in speaking blank verse. He believed that a play should not be adapted merely to serve star performers, and that scenery should be simple and subordinate to dramatic interest.<br>
<br>More provincial touring followed, posing its own difficulties. Benson perceived the need for a circuit of towns for his company's visits, although it was difficult to keep the company stable. People constantly joined and then moved on (although some, such as the excellent low comedian George R. Weir, stayed permanently with Benson). Salaries were negligible and the lure of the London stage was irresistible. All, however, remained loyal old Bensonians, and it is significant that in 1920, for example, no fewer than seventy old Bensonians were playing prominent parts in London. Those who remained on several occasions made financial sacrifices cheerfully in order to keep the venture afloat: such was the loyalty Pa, as Benson was dubbed, inspired.<br>
<br>Indeed, the concept of provincial touring inherently courted financial strains as people and baskets of costumes and sets were transported from town to town. But Benson gradually built up his stock of properties so that he was able to stage virtually any play anywhere as he knocked on virtually every door in the country. In November 1899 a fire at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, destroyed the company's possessions entirely, a loss from which Benson never really recovered (although on that occasion Irving and George Alexander generously loaned costumes so that Benson could fulfil his engagements). Eventually, by the early 1900s, there were several Benson companies, each with a designated area of the country (&#145;north&#146;, &#145;south&#146;, &#145;midland&#146;) to cover. And there was the occasional trip overseas, such as that led by Matheson Lang to the Caribbean in 1904.<br>
<br>A significant aspect of a visit to any town were the games Benson and his company would play against the locals: cricket, soccer, water polo, and other sports were played with equal zest as occasion demanded. This habit endeared them to the provinces but incurred metropolitan disdain. There is the apocryphal tale of a young actor who, asked by Benson whether he could play Rugby, assumed Benson meant the sport, not the role (in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>). Benson did believe acting demanded physical fitness, and he once played hockey in the morning, and then performed Henry V and Macbeth later the same afternoon and evening.<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoConstance"></a>Marriage to Constance</h2>Early in his touring ventures (December 1884) Benson met an actress performing as Constance Fetherstonhaugh. Her father was Captain Morshead Fetherstonhaugh Samwell (1827&#150;1864), and he had died shortly before her birth in India on 26 February 1864. <a name="cosubject_51634"></a><span class="headword">(Gertrude) Constance Benson</span>  (1864&#150;1946) was above average height, and had a slight build and a high, quick voice. Against the wishes of her mother, Anna, who died three months before Constance's wedding day, she had become an <span class="occ">actress</span>, beginning her career with bit parts at Irving's Lyceum. She and Benson married on 24 July 1886 and enjoyed a largely happy marriage which produced two children, Eric William (1887&#150;1916) and Brynhild Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1888). Apart from acting, Constance designed costumes and discovered her vocation in teaching the students attached to the company. Indeed, she was closer to the company than her husband and loved company gossip. When she became too old to sustain leading roles she began her own acting school in London, and one of her early pupils was John Gielgud. She clearly had many strengths, which she drew upon to cope with Benson's many eccentricities. However, she could not tolerate his affair in 1921 with an actress, Genevi&egrave;ve Smeek, also known as Townsend (<i>d</i>. 1 May 1927), and they separated, though they did not divorce. Constance wrote an autobiography, <span class="italic">Mainly Players: Bensonian Memories</span> (1926), two novels, <span class="italic">The Chimera</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Cuckoo Oats</span> (1929), and a handbook on acting, <span class="italic">One Hundred Practical Hints for the Amateur</span> (n.d. [1930]). Lady Benson outlived her husband by six years and died on 19 January 1946.<h2>
<a name="BensonandStratforduponAvon"></a>Benson and Stratford upon Avon</h2>Benson's provincial reputation grew rapidly, and in 1886 he was asked to direct a one-week spring festival at the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, which was the beginning of a long and successful association. The festival week had been established only in 1879 and had not been marked by noteworthy productions. But Benson's zealous, missionary passion for Shakespeare coincided with the ideals of the festival's founder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39452/', "Charles E. Flower (1830&#150;1892)")</script>, the Warwickshire brewer. Benson was seen as a responsible director who could pick a good company, although his early work at Stratford was disdained by London managers and ignored by the capital's press.<br>
<br>The first season began modestly enough on 24 April 1886 with <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and included <span class="italic">Othello</span>, <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, and Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>. Of these <span class="italic">Richard III</span> was deemed the best. Other plays in the Shakespearian canon were added with successive festivals, and eventually, in his thirty years' association with Stratford, Benson produced all Shakespeare's plays with the exception of <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> and <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>. The most frequently staged were <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> (twenty festivals each), followed by <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> and <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (17), <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (16), <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (16), and <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (14). Several plays, however, received only a solitary production.<br>
<br>Benson preferred plays which gave him the opportunity to perform athletically: for example, in 1891 as Caliban in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, he hung upside down from a tree while keeping a fresh fish in his mouth. It was this sort of athletic trait which led Max Beerbohm in 1900 to characterize Benson's <span class="italic">Henry V</span> as a good form of cricket but not acting, a characterization which stuck, much to Benson's detriment. But that overlooks such achievements as introducing the little-performed <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> to Stratford in 1892, the never highly popular <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> in 1893, and a lavish and archaeologically accurate <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> in 1898. He was particularly good as Coriolanus and Antony, although Constance was less secure as Cleopatra. 1899 saw the production of the complete folio version of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, which was performed over an afternoon and evening, with Benson restoring large, unfamiliar portions of the play. Novel, too, was Benson as a beardless Lear for the 1902 festival. By the middle of the 1900s he had staged thirty of Shakespeare's plays and the festival lengthened in duration (the 1903 festival, for example, comprised six plays in two weeks, the 1906 festival eighteen plays in three weeks). A summer season of three to four weeks was instituted in 1910 and became a regular feature. All this received due recognition when in 1910 Stratford conferred the freedom of the borough on Benson, the first actor so distinguished since David Garrick in 1769 (the city of Cork followed suit in 1931).<br>
<br>Ironically, from 1910 onwards Benson's relationship with Stratford became more uneasy, largely because of the financial difficulties he invariably incurred, but also because there was a sentiment to replace Constance, who was becoming too old for the female leads she insisted on performing. Benson soldiered on for a few more years until the First World War finally took its toll. His last attenuated Stratford season was in the spring of 1916.<h2>
<a name="BensonontheLondonstage"></a>Benson on the London stage</h2>The provinces and Stratford were never enough for Benson, and he always yearned to make his mark in London. So he presented his first London season at the Globe Theatre in 1889, beginning on 19 December with <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, which ran for a then record 110 performances. He added <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and <span class="italic">Othello</span> to form a four-play repertory, but this policy, essential to his artistic vision, succeeded only in confusing a public unfamiliar with such a notion. The season ended less successfully than it might have done, and Benson, typically, lost money. He did not return until February 1900, when he took the Lyceum for four months. He presented the <span class="italic">Henry V</span> so disdained by Beerbohm, along with seven other plays, including <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, a complete <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and the production considered to be his best, <span class="italic">Richard II</span>. Again, the season ticket and repertory policy displeased audiences, as did Benson's methods of staging, which were less sumptuous than the elaborately pictorial Shakespeare given by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at Her Majesty's. Subsequently West End seasons followed&#151;at the Comedy (1901), Adelphi (1905), St James's (1910), Shaftesbury (1914), Court (1915), and St Martin's (1920). Additionally, Benson's company appeared regularly at &#145;outer&#146; theatres&#151;the Coronet (Notting Hill), Hammersmith, and Wimbledon&#151;until the late 1920s. Benson also toured Canada and the United States in 1913&#150;14, sometimes to appreciative audiences, but he was mauled by the critics in Chicago. He did, however, receive an honorary LLD degree from McGill University in Montreal in recognition of his services to the theatre.<br>
<br>Further recognition was the knighthood conferred on Benson by George V, during the Shakespeare tercentenary performance given at Drury Lane on 2 May 1916, when he appeared as Julius Caesar. Still in costume, he was knighted in the royal box with a sword borrowed from a local armourer, the first instance of an actor being knighted in a theatre.<h2>
<a name="Wardeclinedeathandreputation"></a>War, decline, death, and reputation</h2>While Benson staged patriotic performances of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> during the early war years, he desperately wanted to make a practical contribution, but he was rejected for active service because of his age. However, while his wife directed a canteen for soldiers in France, Benson drove an ambulance and received the Croix de Guerre for rescuing wounded men on the firing line. Both Benson and Constance grieved deeply for their son, Eric, when he was killed in action in September 1916.<br>
<br>After the war, Benson's fortunes declined sharply. He made his last appearance at Stratford in 1919, and then toured South Africa in 1921&#150;2. On his return he toured the provinces giving farewell performances, and found time to write a book of genial if vague reminiscences, <span class="italic">My Memoirs</span> (1930), and the brief handbook of advice about the acting profession, <span class="italic">I Want to Go on the Stage</span> (1931). He made what was to be his last appearance on stage, as Dr Caius in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, at the Winter Garden on 26 December 1932. When Benson was injured by a bicyclist in Bradford in March 1933, his career was finally ended. He was, by now, living in much reduced financial circumstances and was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in July 1933. He remained a solitary but gentle, courteous old man and, a husk of his former self, lived out his days eccentrically in lodgings at 18 Holland Road, Kensington, London, where he died of broncho-pneumonia and a kidney infection on 31 December 1939. A small private funeral followed on 4 January 1940, attended by Lady Benson and the family; his body was cremated the same day at Golders Green crematorium. However, the theatrical profession was out in force to honour Benson at a memorial service held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 12 January 1940.<br>
<br>By the time of his death, Benson, and whatever innovations and contributions he had made, had been superseded. It is true he was never a great actor: Richard II, Petruchio in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, and Caliban were probably his best roles. His noble Roman appearance with his aquiline nose lent physical distinction to other roles, but he could become easily bored by his own performances and was notorious for &#145;ponging&#146; or extemporizing blank verse (albeit expertly). His great talent was for nurturing other actors, teaching them with his wife, affording them opportunities, and creating a theatrical nursery, and for bringing Shakespeare to countless provincial towns; perhaps his greatest contribution was laying a solid foundation for theatrical performances at Stratford.<br>
