<span class="headword">Orwin,  Charles Stewart</span>  (1876&#150;1955), <span class="occ">agricultural economist and historian</span>, was born on 26 September 1876 at Horsham, Sussex, the only son of Frederick James Orwin and Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Campbell Stewart, of Blackheath, and niece of George Gawler, governor of South Australia (1838&#150;41). Born into a medical family with a reputation for independent, radical thinking, from his earliest days Orwin wanted to be a farmer and, on leaving Dulwich College, he obtained a county scholarship and entered the South Eastern Agricultural College at Wye. There he established a lasting friendship with the principal, Daniel Hall. He left Wye with a college diploma, and went on to receive another from Cambridge&#151;there was no degree in agriculture at this time&#151;and an associateship of the Surveyors' Institution.<br>
<br>As his family could not afford to establish him in farming, Orwin decided on a career as land agent and joined a house agent in the West End of London; a year later, when the firm opened a country office, he found himself in charge of it. On 18 October 1903 he married Elise C&eacute;cile (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of Edward Renault, of Cognac; they had three sons and three daughters. Also in 1903 Orwin accepted a lectureship at his old college at Wye, of which he later became an honorary fellow. In 1906 he was recommended as agent to Christopher Turnor (1873&#150;1940), who had recently inherited some 24,000 acres in Lincolnshire. Orwin accepted the post, which enabled him to utilize his comprehensive knowledge of the country and to develop his aptitude for far-sighted administration. He was also active in local government and, then and later, in the affairs of the church. This did not prevent him from finding time to work out a system of cost accounting which enabled farmers to exercise the same control over their affairs as industrialists had over their factories, and which would also provide a reliable basis for sound agricultural policy, a contribution soon to be given an added significance by war.<br>
<br>When Daniel Hall, representing the Development Commission, persuaded the University of Oxford to sponsor a research institute in agricultural economics, Orwin became its first director in 1913. Hitherto the subject had not been recognized as one for academic study. Orwin's appointment enabled him to be the architect in this new field, to introduce the subject to a rather suspicious public, to attract promising young students, and to lead the way with his own pioneering researches. He was the first to use surveys, first by county, then by topic, in the study of agricultural economics. When he retired in 1945 nearly every university in England, Scotland, and Wales had a department of agricultural economics, and the Ministry of Agriculture had an economics branch; most of these departments were led or staffed by men who had had their initial training at the Oxford Institute for Research in Agricultural Economics. Orwin's energy and capacity for original thinking appealed to the young, whom he went out of his way to encourage.<br>
<br>Early in his career at Oxford Orwin became connected with Balliol College, of which he was a fellow (1922), estates bursar (1926&#150;46), and honorary fellow (1946). In 1939 he became the first DLitt in the Oxford school of social studies. As a research worker in land problems, he did not lose sight of practical issues. He served on the council of the Land Agents' Society and of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors; as editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society</span> from 1912 to 1927 he was in touch with the more prominent landowners and farmers in England; and he was a member of the first Agricultural Wages Board (1917&#150;21). He was also president of the agricultural section of the British Association (1921) and assessor to the agricultural tribunal of investigation (1922&#150;4). On 3 January 1931, following the death of his first wife two years earlier, he married Christabel Susan, daughter of Charles Lowry, headmaster of Tonbridge School. They wrote a number of books together, but she was also a prolific author in her own right, particularly after Orwin's death. The coincidence that they shared common initials has led to some confusion in this respect.<br>
<br>Orwin was best known to the general public for his work as an agricultural historian. His first work of this kind was the <span class="italic">History of Wye Church and College</span>, followed sixteen years later with the <span class="italic">Reclamation of Exmoor Forest</span> (1929, 2nd edn revised with additional material by R. J. Sellick, 1970). His outstanding contribution to agricultural history was <span class="italic">The Open Fields</span> (1938; 2nd edn, 1954; 3rd edn, 1967 with preface by Joan Thirsk), written in collaboration with his second wife, Christabel. This provided a detailed reappraisal of the conventional view of the egalitarian nature of traditional strip farming. Utilizing the records of the only surviving open-field system, of Laxton in Nottinghamshire, it showed how the traditional system was primarily a pragmatic response to the prevailing agricultural conditions, rather than, as traditionally claimed, a means of catering for the social needs of the community.<br>
<br>Orwin's other books were aimed at farmers and landowners, and dealt with accounting and legal matters. Orwin also produced articles on farming matters and agricultural policy for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. His contribution to agricultural economics through articles in professional journals was less significant.<br>
<br>Besides a substantial contribution to teaching and research, as director of the Agricultural Economics Institute, Orwin played a key role in enhancing the role and status of the institute during its difficult embryonic stage. Although the institute was temporarily disbanded during the Second World War, Orwin remained as director until A. W. Ashby was appointed in 1946.<br>
<br>Orwin was very tall, his appearance most impressive, and his face handsome and leonine. Generous in his affections and opinions, he could be easily hurt, for he was a deeply sensitive man. He gave short shrift to the sillinesses of cleverer men, but to the young he reached out with an especial and characteristic courtesy. Orwin died at his home, the Red House in Blewbury, Berkshire, on 30 June 1955.<br>
