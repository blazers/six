<span class="headword">Lucas,  Percy Belgrave</span> <span class="st"> [Laddie Lucas]</span>  (1915&#150;1998), <span class="occ">air force officer, politician, and golfer</span>, was born on 2 September 1915 at The Lodge, Sandwich Bay, Worth, Kent, the son of Percy Montagu Lucas, the secretary of Prince's Golf Club, Sandwich, and his wife, Charlotte Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bone. Lucas acquired his nickname from enquiries by Highland light infantry soldiers billeted in Sandwich as to &#145;How's the wee laddie?&#146; and learned his golfing skills from his father. It was said that, had he fallen out of bed at the clubhouse, he would have dropped on to the first tee. In 1944 he force-landed his damaged Spitfire on the Sandwich links.<br>
<br>Lucas was educated at Stowe School, where he excelled at rugby, cricket, and golf (winning the English boys' championship in 1933), and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read economics and represented the university at golf. In 1936 he was a member of the Walker cup team which toured the USA. The following year he entered journalism as a sports writer for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, and in 1939 he volunteered for the RAF, being posted to 1 initial training wing at Cambridge on 16 January 1940. He was then sent to Canada in the first group of novice pilots to be taught to fly under the empire air training scheme, gaining his wings at 2 service flying training school, Ottawa, in February 1941 as a newly commissioned pilot officer.<br>
<br>Posted back to the UK, Lucas was sent in May 1941 to 52 operational training unit, Debden, and from there to 66 squadron, based at Perranporth in Cornwall with Spitfire Is on convoy patrols. Wanting more action, he volunteered to serve in Burma; instead he was sent to Malta, as one of fifteen Spitfire pilots flown out there by Sunderland flying boat, where he arrived in February 1942.<br>
<br>Malta was then at the nadir of its wartime misfortunes, short of supplies and constantly under air attack: its defending Hurricanes were outclassed and outnumbered. Only when Spitfires arrived, flown off the aircraft-carriers <i>Eagle</i> and <i>Wasp</i> by RAF pilots (including Lucas), did the tide turn; and it was in the counter-offensive which saved Malta from invasion that Lucas first showed his genius as a fighter leader. For a brief period in February 1942 he flew with a Hurricane squadron (185), then from the 27th with 249 squadron, which from March was re-equipped with Spitfire VCs. As a flight commander, then as commanding officer, he led the Takali wing (nos. 249 and 603 squadrons) in Malta's successful repulse of axis air attacks. In July he was awarded the DFC, then flown back to the UK.<br>
<br>By now a squadron leader, Lucas was first posted to Fighter Command headquarters, then to the school of tactics, and on 18 April 1943 he took command of a Spitfire VI squadron, 616, at Ibsley. After three months he was appointed wing commander flying at Coltishall, where he led two Spitfire VB Squadrons, nos. 64 and 611. In January 1944 he was awarded the DSO and posted to air defence of Great Britain headquarters, where he was involved in planning tactical air support for operation Overlord, the allied invasion of Europe.<br>
<br>But in September Lucas began a further tour of operations, on Mosquitos in the intruder role, commanding 613 squadron&#151;following a conversion course at 13 operational training unit and two months at 2 group support unit&#151;from December to the end of hostilities. For his leadership he was awarded a bar to his DSO and the Croix de Guerre with palm.<br>
<br>In the wake of his brilliant wartime career Lucas decided to take on a new challenge&#151;politics&#151;and in June 1945 he was granted special leave to fight the West Fulham parliamentary seat. Though defeated in Labour's landslide victory, he became MP for Brentford and Chiswick five years later.<br>
<br>After his leave for the general election Lucas was posted to 11 group, Fighter Command, then from 3 September to his release from service in January 1946 he commanded RAF Bentwaters. One of his frequent visitors there was the legless fighter ace Group Captain Douglas Bader; and on 18 May 1946 they became brothers-in-law when Lucas married Jill Addison (<i>b</i>. 1921), the sister of Bader's wife, Thelma. They had three sons: Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1947), who died before his fourth birthday, Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1952), and David (<i>b</i>. 1955).<br>
<br>In 1946 Lucas joined the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) through his friendship with one of its founders, Brigadier-General A. C. Critchley, who had told him in 1942 that there would be a job for him after the war. He had worked at the GRA, unpaid, in his university vacations, and his post-war career there prospered: initially assistant to the administrative director, he became assistant managing director in the mid-1950s, then was appointed managing director in 1957 and elected chairman in 1965. After the war Lucas maintained his golfing prowess, captaining the Walker cup team in 1949, and he combined his GRA work with his parliamentary duties. In 1957 the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, offered him the post of under-secretary of state at the Air Ministry, but he declined, feeling that he could not maintain his family and educate two sons on a junior minister's salary. He decided not to stand for parliament again.<br>
<br>In eight years as managing director of the GRA, followed by eleven as chairman until his retirement in 1976, Lucas was involved in many hard-fought boardroom battles. These he vividly described in his crisply written autobiography, <span class="italic">Five up</span> (1978), the first of eight books he produced in his retirement. These comprised a biography of his famous brother-in-law (<span class="italic">Flying Colours: the Epic Story of Douglas Bader</span>), two golfing books, an account of the siege of Malta, and three titles in co-operation with the leading fighter pilot Air Vice-Marshal &#145;Johnnie&#146; Johnson.<br>
<br>Lucas was made CBE in 1981, a civil honour crowning his awards for bravery in the air. Of exceptional charm and charisma, he succeeded in all the roles he played: as golfer, journalist, fighter pilot, business executive, MP, and author. Lucas died at his home, Flat 2, 11 Onslow Square, Chelsea, on 21 March 1998. His widow, Jill, received more than 400 letters of condolence&#151;indicating the wide and affectionate esteem in which he was held. He was buried at St Clement's Church, Sandwich, on 27 March.<br>
