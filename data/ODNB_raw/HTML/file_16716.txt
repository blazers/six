<span class="headword">Lindsay, Sir  Walter, of Balgavie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic conspirator</span>, was the third son of Sir David Lindsay of Edzell, afterwards ninth earl of Crawford (<i>d</i>. 1558), and his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1578), daughter of Sir John Campbell of Lorn and Calder. Walter married Margaret, sister of David Campbell of Kethnott; they had a son, David, and a daughter, Margaret, who married Adam Menzies of Boltoquhan. Lindsay became a gentleman of the bedchamber to James VI in 1580 and together with other young men entered into an obligation to serve the king in time of war at his own expense. On 20 February 1584 he acquired the property of Balgavie, Forfarshire.<br>
<br>In 1583 Lindsay was regarded as an unconvinced protestant, and at some point before 1589 he became a Catholic under the influence of William Crichton and James Gordon, Jesuits working on the Scottish mission. Lindsay claimed that he was one of the first of their converts. He maintained John Ingram&#151;an English Jesuit martyred at Newcastle upon Tyne on 25 July 1594&#151;as his domestic chaplain, and his house became a centre of Catholic life, worship, and intrigue against the protestant party in the country. Lindsay boasted of influencing the earls of Huntly, Erroll, and Angus in their profession of Catholicism, and said that it was at his suggestion that they opened negotiations with Spain in an attempt to secure foreign intervention in Scotland and a possible invasion of England. In subsequent years his fortunes were to be tied to theirs.<br>
<br>In 1589 Lindsay was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, but was conditionally released on 29 November. Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, stood caution for him in the sum of &pound;1000 Scots, that he would on ten days' notice return to custody. At this time Lindsay was acting as an intermediary between the northern Catholic earls and the protestant Bothwell, enlisting his temporary support in their enterprise against the king. Lindsay failed to appear for his trial and on 19 May was proclaimed a rebel. On 11 January 1593 he was ordered to appear before the king on charges of acting against the religious polity of Scotland and in defiance of royal authority. King James marched against the northern earls and their supporters in February, but did not press matters to a conclusion. In May it was reported that Angus, Huntly, and Erroll were meeting in Lindsay's house and attending mass celebrated by an English priest. Lindsay was seen by the English ambassador in Scotland as the &#145;chief instrument and counsellor&#146; of the earls  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1593&#150;5</i>, 419). After the excommunication and forfeiture of the Catholic earls, the king made an autumn march to the north. On 30 September 1594 Lindsay was denounced as a rebel for his association with the earls and for his religious dissent and in October his house was razed by the king's army.<br>
<br>The earls again declined to meet the king in the field and in March 1595 Huntly and Erroll agreed to go abroad. Meanwhile Lindsay was understood to have gone to Rome, as an emissary of the Catholic party in Scotland, in search of a subsidy and military support. He was variously reported in different parts of Europe, including the Low Countries, and it was claimed in 1595 that he had been knighted by the king of Spain. In 1596 Spanish sources speak of Lindsay as being in Spain, negotiating with the government under the pseudonym of Don Balthasar. While abroad he composed his <span class="italic">Account of the present state of the Catholic religion in the realm of Scotland in the year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-four</span>. It was published by Forbes-Leith in 1885.<br>
<br>Huntly and Erroll returned to Scotland in June 1596 and sought terms with the king and the kirk. In June 1597 they were formally reconciled with the reformed church and their forfeitures were revoked. A month later Lindsay too sought to return to Scotland, promising to reveal to the government various items of secret information relating to Spanish policies. On 27 November Sir Robert Cecil was asked for a passport for Lindsay to return home by way of England where, much to King James's displeasure, he was given a polite reception. On his return to Scotland, Lindsay agreed to a conference with the ministers of the kirk, and to remain within the presbytery of Brechin until he had satisfied them as to his orthodoxy. Alexander Lindsay, Lord Spynie, stood cautioner on 24 May 1599 that Lindsay would satisfy the kirk within forty days or else go into exile. There is no record of his submission, however. He may have been under the king's protection, since it was alleged that his contacts were used by James as a secret channel of communication with foreign powers. George Nicholson, the English agent in Scotland, certainly suspected James of double-dealing with Lindsay.<br>
<br>As late as 1601 Lindsay was described as &#145;deep in Papist courses&#146; and of being privy to the earl of Tyrone's rebellion in Ireland  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1600&#150;03</i>, 843). In the last years of his life he also maintained an aggressive local campaign of defence of the Lindsay interests. On 25 October 1605 he was murdered as he rode from Brechin to the Place of Edzell, by a small group of men led by David, master of Crawford and later twelfth earl. The master was a notoriously irresponsible and violent young man, as he showed on this occasion, he and his company giving Sir Walter &#145;ma nor twenty bludie woundis&#146; and cutting his throat for good measure. He was denounced by the king's advocate as having &#145;consavit ane lurkand haitrent causeles&#146; against his victim, to whom, indeed, he was &#145;particularie obleist for his grite kyndnes and beneficiall help &hellip; in his distres&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, <i>1604&#150;7</i>, 143&#150;4). The ferocity of the crime may well have reflected the killer's personality, but it also had a wider context, that of the powerful tensions within the Lindsay kindred, and especially between the family of the earls of Crawford and the Lindsays of Edzell, arising from their competition for local power. Sir Walter was succeeded by his son David.<br>
