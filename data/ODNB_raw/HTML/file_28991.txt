<span class="headword">Weldon, Sir  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1583, <em>d.</em> 1648), <span class="occ">local politician and reputed satirist</span>, was baptized at East Peckham, Kent, on 29 January 1583, the eldest son of Ralph Weldon (1545/6&#150;1609) of Swanscombe, Kent, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1616), the daughter of Leven Buskin. Anthony's father, knighted by James I on 24 July 1603, was clerk of the green cloth to both Elizabeth I and her successor, while his uncle, also Anthony, was clerk of the kitchen. Weldon succeeded to both these places in the royal household: acquiring his uncle's office in 1604 when the latter resigned, and in 1609 inheriting that of his father. On 5 June 1604 Weldon married Elinor, or Ellen (<i>bap</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. 1622), daughter of George Wilmer. They had four daughters and eight sons (of whom six survived to adulthood). Two of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28992/', "Ralph Weldon, the eldest")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28989/', "Anthony Weldon")</script>, held commissions as officers in the parliamentarian armies of the civil war period.<br>
<br>In the tenth year of the reign of James I, Weldon was granted the ownership of Rochester Castle. Firmly ensconced in a place of influence within the royal household, Weldon accompanied the king on his progress to Scotland in 1617 and on the way north was knighted at Berwick on 11 May. However, something went wrong to disrupt the long career at court that Weldon might have anticipated. After his death it was claimed that he was the author, long shrouded in mystery, of a letter which had been written from Leith, near Edinburgh, ostensibly directed to an English correspondent, on 20 June 1617, describing the poverty, bigotry, and foolish traditions of the Scots in exaggerated terms. It is said that, discovering the depths of his official's distaste for the land of his birth, the king dismissed Weldon from his post. However, attribution of the letter to Weldon is very insecure. The many surviving manuscript versions are signed by different names, including John E. and John R. The first surviving printed edition, <span class="italic">A Discription of Scotland</span>, apparently published in the Netherlands in 1626, was credited to one Doctor Corbett. More printed versions were published in the 1640s and 1650s, none of which is ascribed to Weldon. James Howell's name appears on the title-page of the 1649 edition. Claims for Weldon's authorship of the <span class="italic">Perfect Description of the People and Country of Scotland</span> are further undermined by the fact that the clerk of the green cloth and the kitchen does not appear to have relinquished his position in the king's household until October 1623, six years after supposedly falling into disgrace. While it may be possible to see euphemism in the formal instrument by which he laid down his patent, where the reason given for his resignation was his retirement into the country on health grounds, he was nevertheless granted compensation for the loss of office to the tune of &pound;1000, a show of munificence which does not bespeak disfavour. There are hints that he may have fallen victim to Lionel Cranfield's reform of the household. On 11 February the secretary, Conway, had written to Cranfield about taking in hand the articles against Weldon and another household official, Sir Robert Bannister, while in a letter apparently written around that time Weldon sought the assistance of a colleague in moving the case against him from the exchequer chamber to king's bench. It seems entirely likely that Weldon's name became associated with the <span class="italic">Perfect Description</span> only when the violently anti-Jacobean tract of 1650, <span class="italic">The Court and Character of King James</span>, was attributed to him, apologists for the house of Stuart seeking to depict its author as an embittered former courtier. Weldon was imaginatively portrayed as the victim of James I's ire in order that he might be further smeared with the vices of ingratitude, hypocrisy, and tale bearing. After the Restoration Anthony Wood further undermined the former courtier's reputation by offering additional evidence for Weldon's authorship of <span class="italic">The Court and Character</span>. Wood stated that Weldon had shown the work to fellow courtiers before the civil war, but that their horrified reactions convinced him not to publish. But there would appear to be no contemporary evidence whatever to suggest that Weldon even moved into a position of hostility towards the court after he left service there. Certainly, he promoted a scheme for improving assessment of ship money in 1638 by ending the &#145;abuse&#146; of employing sheriffs and high constables as collectors  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637&#150;8</i>, p. 233). In 1641 he complained against the administration of the gunpowder monopoly. But such actions do not clearly mark him out as an opponent of royal policies, much less of the king himself.<br>
<br>However, after 1642 Weldon's loyalties were not in question for a moment. As the head of the county committee he held Kent for parliament, remorselessly engrossing every jurisdiction and applying &#145;dictatorial methods&#146; which rendered him &#145;personally detestable&#146; to the historian of the great rebellion in that shire  (Everitt, 15). He has been portrayed as an autocrat and tyrant, needlessly oppressive in his treatment of the county's numerous royalists, increasingly dependent on an ever narrowing clique of lesser parliamentarian gentry, and most of the blame for the Kentish revolt of 1648 has been laid at Weldon's door. But although much has been made of his reputedly violent and embittered temperament, construed almost entirely on the basis of his supposed sufferings at the hands of James I, it seems likely that Weldon was as much a victim of the &#145;functional radicalisation&#146; which the harsh and terrifying experiences of civil war inflicted on Englishmen in the 1640s, as any malevolence of spirit. His fellow Kentishman, sworn foe, and passionate royalist, Sir Roger Twysden, was gracious enough to acknowledge the &#145;noble principles&#146; which jostled with the &#145;many vanities, if not vices&#146; in Weldon's breast  (Everitt, 134&#150;5). Twysden also believed that it was not Weldon's support for the two houses which motivated him so much as a &#145;desire of rule&#146; inspired by feuds with his neighbours which &#145;brought hym to run with the forwardest&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Weldon did what he could to protect Kent from the exactions of a parliament too easily prey to the many temptations of the rich and populous county on its doorstep, and he himself was quick to blame the 1648 revolt on the disproportionate burden of parliamentary taxation placed on his countrymen. It is probably equally true that Weldon and his cohort too often found their interests betrayed at Westminster, where parliament was prepared to extend a lenient hand to the royalists of the county who rebelled with alarming frequency. For instance, a failure of resolve at Westminster in the prosecution of the Christmas 1647 Canterbury rioters probably also contributed to the rebellion the following summer. Faced with the uncertainty of support at Westminster, Weldon and his clique owed the security of their position in Kent almost entirely to their own efforts, a fact which doubtless helps to explain their vigour in the government of the county.<br>
<br>It is equally clear that the full story of Weldonian &#145;tyranny&#146; cannot be told independently of the factional struggles within the county committee, and their correlation with the conflicts at Westminster between presbyterians and Independents. From 1646 the maintenance of Weldon's supremacy in Kent in the face of the challenges posed by his fellow committee man Sir John Sedley of St Clere depended very largely on the closeness of his ties with the Independent leadership in the House of Commons, and their ability to bear down Sedley's supporters, among them Denzil Holles and Sir William Waller. On 24 October 1648 Weldon was awarded &pound;500 for his service in suppressing the royalist rebellion in Kent. However, he may already have been dead when the award was made. He was buried at Swanscombe on 27 October.<br>
<br>In 1650 <span class="italic">The Court and Character</span> was published. The following year William Sanderson first made the allegation that Weldon was its author, and set in train the tradition of the embittered former courtier. In 1653 a brief history of the English monarchy was published entitled <span class="italic">A Cat may Look upon a King</span>. This book has also been attributed to Weldon, evidently incorrectly, as the author refers to the execution of Charles I, and it is considered far more likely to have been the work of Marchamont Nedham. Despite the somewhat perilous uncertainty of evidence for Weldon's role as a satirist, the publications with which he is commonly associated have enjoyed enormous popularity and influence on later historians. Sir Walter Scott's republication of <span class="italic">The Court and Character</span> in <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Court of James I</span> (1811) revived them, and modern historians have frequently had cause to lament the way in which &#145;Weldon&#146; succeeded in distorting history. He may have been unfair, and his satire was certainly just one example drawn from a rich contemporary vein of courtly criticism, but his version of James VI and I as a perverted, hypocritical, slobbering villain remains compelling.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28991"></a><span class="headword">Michael Weldon</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1654), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was a kinsman of Sir Anthony, a member of the Northumberland branch of the family. He was employed by parliament as an agent to the Scottish committee of estates in May 1643 and commanded a regiment of horse in the Scottish army which entered England the following year, continuing to serve in that capacity until 1646. Letters of administration were granted to his widow, Mary, on 12 July 1654.<br>
