<span class="headword">Neville,  Edward</span>, first Baron Bergavenny  (<em>d.</em> 1476), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was probably the youngest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland (c.1364&#150;1425)")</script>, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53026/', "Joan Beaufort (1379?&#150;1440)")</script>, legitimated daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (1340&#150;1399)")</script>. He founded the baronial house of Abergavenny (the form, adapted from Bergavenny, which was in use in the mid-sixteenth century and was used by successive holders of this title after 1730), which is the only noble branch of the Neville family to survive in the male line to the present day.<br>
<br>In 1426 &#145;dominus de Bourgevenny&#146; was one of the young lords summoned to Leicester to be knighted by the infant Henry VI on Whitsunday (19 May). Edward Neville owed his place among the English peerage to his marriage with a great heiress, Elizabeth (1415&#150;1448), daughter of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Worcester (<i>c</i>.1397&#150;1422), and his wife, the Despenser heiress, Isabel (1400&#150;1439). This advantageous match, which took place in 1424, cost Earl Ralph the sum of 2000 marks, about two years' income from Elizabeth Beauchamp's lands, which did not come into her husband's possession until March 1436. This situation arose because Richard, earl of Worcester, who died on 18 March 1422 of injuries sustained at the siege of Meaux, never had seisin of the Welsh marcher lordship of Abergavenny, or his patrimony in England. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50236/', "William Beauchamp, first Baron Bergavenny (c.1343&#150;1411)")</script>, had given his wife, the redoubtable Lady Joan (1375&#150;1435), a life interest in all his lands. Royal favour and the extinction of a great magnate family, that of the Hastings earls of Pembroke, had enabled Sir William to found and endow a cadet branch of the Beauchamp family. By an entail made on 20 February 1396 he settled the lordship of Abergavenny on the male line of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1841/', "Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (1337x9&#150;1401)")</script>, in default of male issue among his own descendants; this settlement excluded Elizabeth Beauchamp and enabled Sir William's nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1838/', "Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (1382&#150;1439)")</script>, to inherit the lordship of Abergavenny on the death of Lady Joan in 1435. He was Elizabeth's stepfather, as he had married the Despenser heiress, Isabel, as his second wife in 1423. The English manors inherited by Edward Neville's wife, Elizabeth, had been formerly owned by the Hastings and Arundel families and were declared to have a taxable value of 1000 marks a year in 1436. After 1450 the Neville barons of Abergavenny ranked with the English higher nobility in landed wealth, but promotion to an earldom did not take place until 1784.<br>
<br>The male line of the Beauchamp earls of Warwick was extinguished by the death on 11 June 1446 of Earl Richard's only son, Henry, first (and last) duke of Warwick (1425&#150;1446). His heir was his only child, the Lady Anne of Warwick, who was three years old when her father died. Edward Neville and his wife, Elizabeth, saw this girl's minority as an opportunity to lay claim to the lordship of Abergavenny, but they did not resort to litigation. Probably in the autumn of 1446 Neville took possession of Abergavenny Castle by force and in October Henry VI ordered Richard, duke of York (the greatest of the Welsh marcher lords and Neville's brother-in-law), to expel him. Elizabeth Beauchamp died on 18 June 1448, but, despite his wife's death, Neville continued to pursue his claim to the disputed lordship. Following the death of the child heiress, Anne, on 3 January 1449, Neville obtained royal licence on 14 July to enter on the lordship of Abergavenny, but he could not defeat the well-founded title of his powerful nephew, the earl of Salisbury's eldest son and heir, the newly created earl of Warwick, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19955/', "Richard Neville (1428&#150;1471)")</script>, who had married Anne Beauchamp (1426&#150;1493), Duke Henry's sister, in 1436. Despite his failure to make good his claims, Edward Neville was summoned to parliament as Baron Bergavenny in September 1450, and his heirs inherited that dignity. Between 1450 and 1512, by a remarkable anomaly, the barons of Abergavenny were not in possession of the Welsh marcher lordship from which they took their peerage title.<br>
<br>Edward Neville did not have the abilities of his capable elder brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19954/', "Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (1400&#150;1460)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19967/', "William Neville, Lord Fauconberg, afterwards earl of Kent (1401?&#150;1463)")</script>, and he took little part in war or politics. He supported the government headed by Richard, duke of York, as lord protector in 1454, when Salisbury was made (on 1 April) lord chancellor. As a landowner in Kent, where he had his principal residence at Birling, near Maidstone, he could not escape involvement in the civil war when his nephews, the earls of Warwick and March (the future Edward IV), invaded England from Calais in June 1460. He was with them at the battle of Northampton, fought on 10 July, which ended the rule of the house of Lancaster. After the change of dynasty in 1461 Neville helped to put down Lancastrian resistance in northern England late in 1462, but he held aloof from the political and dynastic upheavals of 1469&#150;71. After Edward IV's final victory Bergavenny was one of the peers who, on 3 July 1471, in the parliament chamber at Westminster, swore an oath of loyalty to the infant Edward, prince of Wales (afterwards Edward V), as his father's heir. His public activities in his later years appear to have been confined to serving on commissions in Kent, and he died on 18 October 1476.<br>
<br>Shortly after the death of his first wife, Elizabeth, Neville married his kinswoman (and mistress) Katherine (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1478), daughter of Sir Robert Howard, and sister of John, Lord Howard (<i>d</i>. 1485), created duke of Norfolk by Richard III in 1483. The papal dispensation needed for this union was granted by Pope Nicholas V on 15 October 1448. From his second marriage Neville had two sons who died childless, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Neville's heir, <a name="cosubject_53595"></a><span class="headword">George Neville</span>  (1436&#150;1492)<span class="occ"></span>, his second but only surviving son with Elizabeth Beauchamp, succeeded him as the second Baron Bergavenny. As a child, he had been in the household of Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1455), who became lieutenant-general in France, and George was one of the hostages given to the victorious French when Rouen was surrendered in October 1449. After the death early in 1449 of the infant Beauchamp heir, Anne, he was found to be coheir, with the late Duke Henry's sister, Anne Beauchamp (1426&#150;1493), of the Despenser lands formerly held by his grandmother, Isabel, countess of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1439). Except perhaps for a brief interlude during the summer of 1470, when Warwick had been forced into exile in France, George Neville was never able to obtain seisin of that part of his family inheritance, which included the valuable lordships of Glamorgan and Morgannwg. His cousin Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, succeeded in keeping control of the whole of the Despenser estates, in the right of his wife, Anne. Shortly before Henry VI became insane in July 1453, Somerset's attempt to gain custody of George Neville's share of the Despenser lands led to conflict with Warwick, who supported Richard, duke of York, at the first battle of St Albans, fought on 22 May 1455. George Neville came of age in 1457; he fought on the Yorkist side at the battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, and was knighted by Edward IV. The second Lord Bergavenny was a supporter of Richard III, whose territorial possessions included the lordships of Abergavenny and Glamorgan and Morgannwg. Like most of the English peerage he was absent from the battle of Bosworth and he proved loyal to Henry VII. His heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19935/', "George Neville, third Baron Bergavenny (c.1469&#150;1535)")</script>, was granted the castle and lordship of Abergavenny by Henry VIII on 18 December 1512. Other sons with his first wife, Margaret Fenne (<i>d</i>. 1485), were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19930/', "Sir Edward Neville (b. in or before 1482, d. 1538)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19964/', "Sir Thomas Neville (b. in or before 1484, d. 1542)")</script>.<br>
