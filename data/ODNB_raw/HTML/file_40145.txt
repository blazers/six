<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hutton, Sir  Leonard <span class="st"> [Len]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1990), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 23 June 1916 at 5 Fulneck, near Pudsey, Leeds, the youngest of the six children of Henry Hutton (1876&#150;1947), builder and foreman joiner, and his wife, Lily Swithenbank (1875&#150;1952). Moravians, the earliest protestant sect in Europe, had come to Fulneck in 1732 and within a generation Benjamin Hutton, a tailor from Scotland, had been the first of his family to settle there. Moravian traditions of discipline, hard work, self-sufficiency, and craftsmanship would be the lodestars of Leonard Hutton's life and professional career. He was brought up in one of the community terraced houses &#145;in a home which was strict but caring&#146;  (Howat, 3) and attended the chapel, but there were not the financial resources to send him to Fulneck School, despite the emphasis it gave to cricket. Instead, he went to Littlemoor council school in Pudsey, practising on the concrete playground or at the Pudsey St Lawrence club, where his three elder brothers all played in Yorkshire league cricket.<h2>
<a name="Yorkshirebatsman"></a>Yorkshire batsman</h2>At thirteen Hutton made his d&eacute;but for the club's first eleven and in 1930, on the recommendation of his near neighbour Herbert Sutcliffe, he reported to the Yorkshire indoor shed at Headingley, where he was coached by George Hirst. In the same year he watched Donald Bradman make his 334 in a test match, a record in Anglo-Australian tests which Hutton himself would eclipse eight years later. That autumn the fourteen-year-old began a year at Pudsey grammar school, where he studied technical drawing and quantitative work before joining the building firm of Joseph Verity. He would remain with them in the winters until 1939 and retain a practical interest in woodwork all his life.<br>
<br>In the season of 1933 Hutton opened the batting both for Pudsey St Lawrence and Yorkshire second eleven (where he averaged 69.90), the prelude to his first eleven d&eacute;but in 1934 against Cambridge University. He was still six weeks off his eighteenth birthday and the youngest player to have appeared for Yorkshire. In anxious pursuit of his first run, a throw from Jack Davies dismissed him for 0. But against Worcestershire he became the youngest Yorkshire centurion when he made 196. Neville Cardus wrote that he was mature at an age when other brilliant beginners were merely showing promise. But the young man, whom the press were idolizing, remained &#145;the most retiring and unconceited personality that anyone could meet&#146;  (Howat, 20).<br>
<br>In playing for Yorkshire, Hutton had joined the strongest county side of the inter-war years, to whom winning the championship was almost a prescriptive right. Their tight ranks only welcomed a newcomer once he had proved his worth. From men such as Maurice Leyland, Hedley Verity, and Bill Bowes he learned the folklore of the Yorkshire cricket tradition. Sutcliffe remained his strongest advocate, and declared in print, in 1935, that at fourteen he had been good enough to play for most county sides. Hutton (and others) found the eulogy embarrassing: the more so, as the seasons of 1935 and 1936 were not without their pitfalls. He averaged under 30 in both and&#151;never the most robust of men&#151;had to be rested through physical strain. The press were beginning to criticize his reluctance to display the strokes at his command. Yorkshire, however, kept faith and he became, in July 1936, their youngest capped player in the twentieth century.<h2>
<a name="Recordinnings"></a>Record innings</h2>Hutton's test d&eacute;but, against New Zealand at Lord's in 1937, was as inglorious as his first-class one three years earlier. He was dismissed for 0 and 1, but redeemed himself with a century at Old Trafford a month later. Then, in August 1938, after two months' absence through injury, came his innings of 364 against the Australians at the Oval in the fifth test. In beating Bradman's record to make what remains the highest individual score in Anglo-Australian tests, Hutton fulfilled all the attributes of skill, concentration, and endurance so often credited to him. If the press were lost for words, they hid the fact successfully enough in column upon column of reporting. Not since the abdication crisis two years earlier had the thoughts of millions throughout the British empire been so centred on one person. Even the American magazine <span class="italic">Time</span> reported on his innings. Hutton, ever after, would be conscious of his obligations to those, especially the young, who came to watch him. He would play better innings in the years to come (six, at least) but &#145;364&#146; remained for the rest of his life as much a millstone as a milestone.<br>
<br>While not fulfilling the highest expectations in South Africa (1938&#150;9), Hutton averaged 96.00 against the West Indies in 1939. The Second World War broke out twelve days after he had made 165 not out at the Oval in the third test. Pelham Warner summed him up at the time as possessing &#145;every stroke conceivable&#146;  (Howat, 50). The first wartime <span class="italic">Wisden</span> called him &#145;one of the world's greatest batsmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1940, 513).<br>
<br>On 16 September 1939 Hutton married in Wykeham parish church Dorothy Mary (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of George Dennis, foreman joiner on Lord Downe's estate at Wykeham, Yorkshire. He had known her since 1935. The happiness of that marriage proved central to an understanding of his later success. She was as vital to her husband in his cricket career as in his later business one. Over the years they successfully faced the twin hazards of fame and separation. Of their two games-playing sons, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1942) would play for Cambridge University, Yorkshire, and England.<br>
<br>Hutton's war service, as a sergeant in the Army Physical Training Corps, ended in 1941. He fell in a gymnasium while on a commando course. The resultant fracture of his left arm put his cricket future in doubt. There followed operations and graftings and he would eventually resume his cricket career with an arm 2 inches shorter and a need to adjust his batting technique. He was able, in 1943, to captain Pudsey St Lawrence (not without some differences of opinion with club officialdom) and in 1944 he played in two matches at Lord's&#151;for the Rest, and then for England, both against Australia. He was &#145;the real Hutton of brilliant and elegant stroke-play&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 May 1944). In 1945, when the war in Europe was over, he played in the victory internationals against Australia, although Pudsey, who paid him &pound;100 a season, resented his absences for these national occasions and had released him most reluctantly.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war era Hutton was the mainstay of England's batting against dominating Australians, challenging South Africans, and burgeoning West Indians. A cameo of 37 in the second test at Sydney during England's 1946&#150;7 tour of Australia evoked the Yorkshire journalist J. M. Kilburn to flights of fancy: &#145;Hutton scattered light, loveliness and brave beauty and took cricket to the pinnacles of artistry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening Post</span>, 19 Dec 1946). His 158 in the second test at Johannesburg in 1948&#150;9 helped England to a record first-wicket partnership of 359 while his double century (in which he carried his bat) against the West Indies at the Oval in 1950 was a masterly display on a difficult wicket. He had also been flown out to the West Indies in February 1948 to strengthen a struggling MCC side and, in the five matches which remained of the tour, achieved an average of 64.22.<h2>
<a name="CaptainofEngland"></a>Captain of England</h2>In 1952 Hutton became England's first professional captain in the twentieth century, an invitation more widely welcomed than he allowed himself to realize. India were defeated 3&#150;0 and the captain topped the batting averages. Meanwhile, he had never ignored his obligations to Yorkshire, whose senior professional he became soon after the war, though he was never made their captain. The county gave him a benefit match in 1950, which realized &pound;9713, tax free. It was by far the highest ever received by a Yorkshire player. Hutton, who was an assiduous follower of the stock market, did not get the capital sum back, invested on his behalf by the county (as was the custom), until 1972. Cricket did not make even the top players of his generation rich and he would always assess his own financial worth. &#145;How much will we make?&#146; he had asked when <span class="italic">Cricket is my Life</span> was published in 1949. For Yorkshire he continued to make runs as consistently as he did for England.<br>
<br>In coronation year (1953) Hutton brought the mythical Ashes back to England after nineteen years in Australian custody, the outcome decided by England's victory at the Oval in August 1953, in which he scored 82 in the first innings. Again he topped the averages. He took MCC to the West Indies in 1953&#150;4 at a time when the movement for national independence in the Caribbean was gaining strength. <span class="italic">The Times</span> called the tour &#145;the second most controversial in cricket history&#146;  (Howat, 141) and the demands upon Hutton's captaincy were compounded by umpiring disputes and crowd riots. Yet again he led from the front with a test average of 96.71 and a double century in the final test, which ensured that England drew the series. Despite his unfitness during the Pakistani visit to England in 1954, he made himself available for the forthcoming tour of Australia. Both he and his rival for the captaincy, David Sheppard&#151;both men of strong moral fibre&#151;conducted themselves with dignity during the summer. Hutton was eventually appointed and, though less successful as a batsman, he retained the Ashes. On his return from Australia he was elected to membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club, the first serving professional to be so honoured. But, stricken with lumbago, he relinquished the England captaincy in May 1955. If his had been a pragmatic appointment three years earlier, pragmatism had triumphed and the plaudits were generous. His diplomacy off the field, when abroad, could not be faulted. On the field undue caution and slow over rates had been the negative aspects of his leadership. But he had been quietly effective rather than demonstrative and displayed a tenacity of will which embodied total dedication. Only Peter May, in the long banner roll of England captains, would match his achievements as leader and performer.<h2>
<a name="Knighthoodandretirement"></a>Knighthood and retirement</h2>In June 1955 Hutton made 194 for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire in his 129th and last century in first-class cricket, but in the following January he retired on medical advice. With a few more appearances his career record would be 40,140 runs (55.51), nearly three-quarters of which had been made for Yorkshire. In seventy-nine test matches he scored 6971 runs (56.67), with nineteen centuries. Harry Altham, in a broadcast, declared that a great chapter in the history of cricket had ended. But for Sir Leonard Hutton&#151;knighted in June 1956&#151;another one had to open. At first, work as a broadcaster and journalist came his way. Both the London <span class="italic">Evening News</span> and <span class="italic">The Observer</span> employed him for many years but the significant change was an invitation to join the firm of J. H. Fenner, power transmission engineers. He would work for them longer than he had played first-class cricket. At first his role was to talk cricket to the firm's associates. The fitting of Fenner mechanical products to a new MGB model gave cars &#145;as smooth a performance as a Hutton innings&#146;. However laboured the analogy or the pun, his name would be linked and his presence required. But events took an unexpected turn as Hutton, who became a director in 1973, found himself selling the products of his firm even in non-cricketing countries, where his name was of no consequence.<br>
<br>The Hutton family had taken the decision in 1961 to leave Pudsey and settle in London. Living in Kingston upon Thames came to suit both his role in business and his work as a journalist. He served briefly (1975&#150;7) as an England selector but felt he could not spare the time from his work for Fenner. He published three books, of which <span class="italic">Fifty Years in Cricket</span> (1984) was the most illuminating. John Arlott called it a model cricket autobiography. Hutton identified with Surrey in his later years, especially with the &#145;Save the Oval&#146; campaign, but he also accepted an invitation in January 1990 to become president of Yorkshire at a time of some &#145;political&#146; unrest in the club.<br>
<br>Achievement and fulfilment were all-in-all to Hutton, and always those stern puritan voices from his upbringing were calling him to succeed. His cricket was never meant to be a joyride, yet he was not a joyless man without humour. His own brand was never far away and might be seen in the twinkle in his blue eyes, a warm smile, in his delphic utterances and enigmatic remarks. Humour lurked in the wings but he was aware that he was expected to be centre-stage and he took the trouble to talk to people and to remember them.<br>
<br>Hutton died in Kingston Hospital, Surrey, on 6 September 1990, five days after watching a Natwest final at Lord's. His wife survived him. His funeral took place on 13 September at St Peter's, Kingston, and he was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium. There was a memorial service in York Minster, at which the bishop of Liverpool, his former colleague David Sheppard, gave the address.<br>
