<span class="headword">Marsh,  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1774&#150;1835), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born in Norwich, a younger son of Edward Marsh, manufacturer and merchant, of St Saviour's, Norwich, and his wife, Catherine. He was educated at Norwich grammar school under Dr Forster. On 5 October 1792 he was admitted pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge. He resided for four terms but did not graduate. He became a student of Lincoln's Inn on 26 September 1791 and was called to the bar on 3 July 1797. He married Mary Hale, daughter of Thomas Lewin of Bexley, Kent. They had one son, Hippisley Marsh (1808&#150;1884), who became a colonel in the Bengal army.<br>
<br>In 1804 Marsh obtained an Indian judicial appointment through the intervention of Sir John Coxe Hippisley and went to Madras, where he practised with great success. He returned to England in 1809 and was elected MP for East Retford in 1812. It was said that he tricked his way into parliament, falsely representing himself to the electors as the whig candidate. Once there, he was a consistent supporter of Catholic relief and an opponent of attempts to impose Christianity in India. On 1 July 1813 he spoke in a committee of the house in support of the amendment moved by Sir Thomas Sutton on a clause in the <span class="roman">East India Bill</span> providing further facilities for people to go out to India for religious purposes. His speech, which occupies thirty-two columns of Hansard's <span class="italic">Parliamentary Debates</span>  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 26, 1813, 1018), was described by a contemporary as &#145;one of the most pointed and vigorous philippics in any language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, 70.290). During his first session he voted as a Wellesleyite. Subsequently he was a supporter of the government. In parliament and elsewhere he was critical of Sir George Barlow in Madras and of General Gore, the governor of Upper Canada. He contested Sudbury unsuccessfully in 1818 and Petersfield in 1831. He was known to be in great financial difficulties in the 1820s. He died in 1835.<br>
<br>Marsh was a contributor to <span class="italic">The Cabinet: by a Society of Gentlemen</span> (3 vols., 1795). He also wrote several pamphlets, including <span class="italic">An Appeal to the Public Spirit of Great Britain</span> (1803). This revised version of an earlier pamphlet supporting the political actions of William Windham was prepared with Windham's help. Marsh's speech on the <span class="roman">East India Bill</span> was printed in pamphlet form and also in volume 2 of <span class="italic">The Pamphleteer</span> in 1813. The famous &#145;Letters of Vetus&#146; in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1812) were wrongly ascribed to him. In fact they were written by Edward Sterling, father of John Sterling (1806&#150;1844). Two lively volumes of gossip, <span class="italic">The Clubs of London</span>, are thought to be his work. He frequently contributed to the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>The lawyer and MP is not to be confused with <a name="cosubject_18106"></a><span class="headword">Charles Marsh</span>  (1735&#150;1812)<span class="occ"></span>, the only son of Charles Marsh, a London bookseller. He was admitted to Westminster School in 1748. He was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1753, and graduated BA in 1757 as senior classical medallist. He became a fellow of his college in 1758, proceeding MA in 1760. He was subsequently a clerk in the war office. On 15 January 1784 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and the following May he gave a Latin dissertation to the society entitled &#145;On the elegant ornamental cameos of the Barberini vase&#146;, which was printed in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (8.316&#150;20). In 1811 he published a translation of John Milton's <span class="italic">L'allegro</span>. He possessed a valuable library of old books. After many years' employment in the war office he retired, on a pension of &pound;1000 a year. He lived at Rodnor House, Twickenham, and died, unmarried, either there or in Piccadilly, London, on 21 January 1812. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
