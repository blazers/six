<span class="headword">Trethowan, Sir  (James) Ian Raley</span>  (1922&#150;1990), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 20 October 1922 in High Wycombe, the only child of Major James Jackson Raley Trethowan MBE, a retired army officer who combined a life in business and army welfare with writing about sport, and his wife, Winifred Timms. Trethowan followed in his father's footsteps to Christ's Hospital, Horsham, Sussex, where he displayed only modest academic achievement; he left at the age of sixteen to pursue a career in journalism. A short spell as post-boy at the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> led to a reporting job on the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, before Trethowan joined the Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War in 1941. After the war he rejoined the <span class="italic">Post</span> in 1946. Working for its London staff he rose rapidly to parliamentary lobby correspondent. There his meticulousness began to be widely noticed. His writing was mostly terse and to the point, and he had a good nose for what constituted a story. He also developed fine contacts within the tory party, about which he made no secret, but which never became so blatant as to diminish his effectiveness as a chronicler of politics across the board.<br>
<br>Trethowan moved to the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> in 1955 and from there was tempted by Geoffrey Cox to join the fledgeling Independent Television News, where he took an on-screen role between 1958 and 1963. Trethowan did not develop into a permanent newscaster, always preferring to involve himself in a little administration. He served as ITN's deputy editor, before moving on to the larger canvas of the BBC in 1963. Trethowan's main work at the BBC was again political, dealing both with Westminster direct and with the broader world of politics through the weekly programme <span class="italic">Gallery</span>. At the same time he was political commentator for the <span class="italic">Economist</span> (1953&#150;8 and 1965&#150;7) and <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1967&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1968 Baron Hill of Luton, an old political comrade and now chairman of the BBC, needed a new managing director for BBC Radio to succeed F. G. Gillard, the veteran correspondent and administrator. Trethowan, somewhat to his surprise, was asked to apply. He was offered the job and took it&#151;in part, he recorded, because he knew he would never be top-flight on television: &#145;Not a star&#146;, Huw Wheldon had told him, firmly but with kindness.<br>
<br>Trethowan skilfully negotiated the pitfalls of radio management from 1969 to 1975. Radios 1, 2, 3, and 4 were introduced with less pain than had been anticipated. In 1976 Trethowan was switched back to television, this time as managing director, as part of a deliberate grooming for the top job. He succeeded Sir Charles Curran as director-general in late 1977. In his own view he had had &#145;a lot of luck&#146;.<br>
<br>In his first years at the top, Trethowan was fortunate that his chairman was Sir Michael Swann, a clubbable man of clear view. In Swann's opinion, the BBC would work best if the director-general did the driving, while the chairman and his board assisted in reading the map. Although Trethowan was sometimes suspected by radical broadcasters of acting purely as the &#145;thirteenth governor&#146;, his own memoir, <span class="italic">Split Screen</span>, analyses in some detail a relationship of sturdy delicacy and shows why it worked well. The political world was sufficiently convinced both to renew the BBC charter, and to sustain the value of the licence fee even during difficult inflationary times. Trethowan suffered a heart attack in 1979, but recovered to continue in office until his official retirement in 1982.<br>
<br>Unlike most BBC directors-general, Trethowan had a full and active life beyond the BBC. He pursued his second love, the turf, as chairman of the Horserace Betting Levy Board between 1982 and 1990, took a directorship at Barclays Bank from 1982 to 1987, and eventually re-emerged in commercial television as director in 1986&#150;7, and then chairman from 1987 to 1990, of Thames Television. There controversy followed him over the 1988 programme <span class="italic">Death on the Rock</span>, which asked hard questions about the killing of three IRA terrorists. Trethowan stood by the programme and diverted much of the political animus. He again drew on that firm but unfailing courtesy which had stood him in good stead in all his broadcasting and journalistic endeavours. He had a clear vision of the proper province of both commentators and those commentated upon, and throughout his career this enabled him to defuse potentially explosive editorial challenges. In appearance both unassertive and unassuming, he would none the less stand his ground, his determination deepening with each twist and turn of external pressure.<br>
<br>Among his other activities, Trethowan was a trustee of Glyndebourne Arts Trust from 1982 and of the British Museum from 1984, a governor of the Ditchley Foundation from 1985, and on the board of the British Council from 1980 to 1987. The University of East Anglia made him an honorary DCL in 1979, and he was knighted in 1980.<br>
<br>Trethowan's life was cut short by the onset of motor neurone disease, which he bore with good grace, even in its latter wheelchair stages. In 1950 he had married Patricia, daughter of Colonel John Elliott Nelson, retired army officer. They had no children. The marriage was dissolved in 1963 and in the same year he married Carolyn, daughter of Alfred Brian Challen Reynolds, retired army officer and company director. They had three daughters, and it was Trethowan's greatest consolation that he lived to see them into maturity. He died on 12 December 1990 in the Cromwell Hospital, London. A memorial service was held in St Martin-in-the-Fields on 5 March 1991.<br>
