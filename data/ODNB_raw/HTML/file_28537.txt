<span class="headword">Wallace,  John Alexander Dunlop Agnew</span> <span class="st"> [styled Sir John Wallace, sixth baronet]</span>  (1774/5&#150;1857), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of Thomas Dunlop Wallace (<i>d</i>. 1835), of Craigie, Ayrshire, who assumed the style of fifth baronet, and his first wife, Eglantine (<i>d</i>. 1803), known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28530/', "Lady Wallace")</script>, youngest daughter of Sir William Maxwell, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1771), of Montreith, Wigtownshire.<br>
<br>Wallace was given a commission as ensign in the 75th (Highland) regiment on 28 December 1787, his family having helped to raise it. He joined it in India in 1789, became lieutenant on 6 April 1790, and served in Cornwallis's operations against Tipu in 1791&#150;2, including the siege of Seringapatam. He acted as aide-de-camp to Colonel Maxwell, who commanded the left wing of the army. He obtained a company in the 58th regiment on 8 June 1796, and returned to England to join it. He went with it to the Mediterranean in 1798, and was present at the capture of Minorca, and in the 1801 campaign in Egypt. It formed part of the reserve under Moore, and was hotly engaged in the battle of Alexandria. It came home in 1802. He was promoted major on 9 July 1803, and became a lieutenant-colonel in the 11th battalion of reserve on 28 August 1804. At the end of 1805 he was transferred to the 88th (Connaught Rangers) to command a newly raised 2nd battalion.<br>
<br>Wallace went to the Peninsula with this battalion in 1809. With 300 men from it he joined the 1st battalion at Campo Mayor, while the rest went on to Cadiz. The 1st battalion had suffered in the Talavera campaign; he set himself vigorously to restore it, and made it one of the finest in the army. It greatly distinguished itself at Busaco. It was on the left of the 3rd division, and when the French had gained the ridge, and seemed to have cut the army in two, a charge made by the 88th, with one wing of the 45th, drove them down headlong. Wellington, riding up, said, &#145;Wallace, I never saw a more gallant charge than that just made by your regiment.&#146; Picton gave Wallace the credit for &#145;that brilliant exploit&#146;.<br>
<br>Wallace commanded the 88th at Fuentes de Onoro, and was again particularly mentioned in Wellington's dispatch. He was also mentioned in the dispatch after Salamanca, where he was in command of the right brigade of the 3rd division (Pakenham's). During the retreat of the army from Burgos, he had a very severe attack of fever at Madrid. Conveyance in a cart to Santarem in very bad weather aggravated its effects, and he was dangerously ill for nearly eight months. He had no further service in the Peninsula; but he commanded a brigade in the army of occupation in France in the latter part of 1815. He received the gold medal with two clasps, and was made CB in 1815.<br>
<br>Wallace became colonel in the army on 4 June 1813, and on 12 August 1819 major-general. He was made colonel of the 88th on 20 October 1831, and a KCB on 16 September 1833. On the death of his father in 1835, he called himself sixth baronet. He became lieutenant-general on 10 August 1837, and general on 11 November 1851.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1829 Wallace married Janette (<i>d</i>. 1862), daughter of William Rodger, and they had five sons and one daughter. He died at Lochryan House, Stranraer, Wigtownshire, on 10 February 1857, aged eighty-two.<br>
