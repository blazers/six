<span class="headword">Donald</span> <span class="st"> [Dyfnwal son of Owen]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 975), <span class="occ">king of the Cumbrians</span>, was the son of Owen, who as ruler of Strathclyde was active in the 930s as an ally of Constantine II, king in Scotland between 900 and 943, against &AElig;thelstan of Wessex; it was probably Owen, rather than his son, whom &AElig;thelstan defeated with Constantine at &#145;Brunanburh&#146; in 937. Donald was apparently king by <i>c</i>.941. About that year Kaddroe, a clerical aristocrat of Pictish or British descent who was highly regarded at King Constantine's court, passed through Donald's lands intending to go to the continent.<blockquote>King Donald [Dovenaldus] ruled over the people there, and because he was a relative of [Kaddroe] he received him with all joy; after keeping him with him for some time, he brought him to the town of Loida, on the bounds of the Norse [of York] and the Cumbrians. (<span class="italic">Acta sanctorum</span>, March, 1.476)</blockquote>The unidentified &#145;Loida&#146; must be in the region of Stainmore Common, on the borders of Yorkshire and Westmorland; this was long recognized as the southern boundary of the kingdom of Cumbria and the diocese of Glasgow. A point that emerges from this story is that although Kaddroe was related to Donald, he is not described as a relative of Constantine; Donald and Constantine were therefore presumably unrelated.<br>
<br>A son of Donald, whose name appears in garbled form as Rhadarc or Amdarch (or slight variants of these; possibly Rhydderch), slew Culen, king in Scotland, somewhere in Lothian in 971, &#145;because of the rape of his daughter, whom the king had carried off for himself&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.476). It is not stated that this Rhadarc, son of Donald, was king at the time; but he must have been an important personage among the Britons, since the king of Scotland was interested in his daughter, and since he appears to have been in command of a considerable British war band. He is not heard of again; by 973 his brother Malcolm was &#145;king of the Cumbrians&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.478), and was one of the kings said to have rowed King Edgar on the Dee at Chester in that year. Another of the kings said to have been involved is named as Dufnal; he is not otherwise identified, and may be the same Donald, son of Owen, still living but now with his son associated in the kingship.<br>
<br>The death of &#145;Domnall, son of Eogan, king of the Britons, on pilgrimage&#146; is recorded in the Irish annals s.a. 975; likewise a late Welsh source records that in 975 &#145;Dunguallon, king of Strathclyde&#146; went to Rome and received the tonsure  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.480). He must have resigned the kingship in Malcolm's favour by this time; possibly, indeed, <i>de facto</i> power had passed to his sons by 971. Donald (or perhaps more accurately Dyfnwal) may have been more independent of the kings of Scotland than some of his predecessors. From the 870s the kings of Strathclyde appear to have been clients of the kings of Scotland; in at least one instance the son of a king of Scotland was imposed as king of Strathclyde. From 954 to 971, however, the kingship of Scotland was disturbed by serious internal dynastic feuding, with the crown changing hands by violence four times. It was probably as a result of this, as well as the collapse of viking York, that the Strathclyde kings were able to reassert a measure of independence under Donald and under his sons&#151;Malcolm, who at his death in 997 was described as &#145;king of the Britons of the north&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.517), and <a name="cosubject_49381"></a><span class="headword">Owen the Bald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1018), <span class="occ">king of the Cumbrians</span>, who succeeded Malcolm and ruled in Cumbria until his death in 1018, after which his realm was finally absorbed into the kingdom of the Scots.<br>
