<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Priebsch,  Robert</span>  (1866&#150;1935), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 11 June 1866 at Tannwald in Bohemia, the second of four sons of Johann Priebsch, cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Eleonore, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Riedel. The Priebsch family, which probably owed its name to the town of Priebisch, north-east of Glogau, can be traced back to the early seventeenth century; there was much intermarriage between them and the Riedels, who were known as glass-blowers and glass-painters as well as magistrates. Priebsch had most of his schooling at Reichenberg. From 1886 to 1895 he studied successively at Prague, Leipzig, Berlin, Graz, and Strasbourg universities, devoting himself to a wide range of subjects including Germanic mythology, German literature, philosophy, logic, and Anglo-Saxon. He took his doctorate on a topic in medieval German literature at Graz in 1895.<br>
<br>After leaving Strasbourg, Priebsch came to England to examine and catalogue German medieval manuscripts in public and private collections, including those of Lord Ashburnham, Sir Thomas Phillips, and the earl of Crawford. Through his <span class="italic">Deutsche Handschriften in England</span> (1896&#150;1901; repr. 1979) and a series of articles on German manuscripts in the Royal Library at Brussels, published in <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r deutsche Philologie</span> between 1903 and 1907, he came to be the acknowledged authority on German palaeography. His rapidly growing scholarly reputation led, first, to his appointment as lecturer in Anglo-Saxon at the University of Liverpool through an invitation from the eminent Celtic philologist Kuno Meyer, and then, in 1898, to the chair of German at University College, London, where, together with John George Robertson, he built up a distinguished school of Germanic studies. On 12 July 1898 he married Ada Mary Rademacher (also known as Radmar), the highly cultivated granddaughter of a Rhinelander who had settled in London, and daughter of Charles John Rademacher, company director. They had one child, Hannah Margaret Mary (1905&#150;1953).<br>
<br>Always correctly clad in frock coat and silk hat, Priebsch cut an elegant figure. Despite being afflicted since childhood with paralysis of the foot muscles he had enjoyed his student life to the full, manfully fighting duels that scarred his kindly face for life. His disability doubtless helped foster his love of books. He gradually built up a remarkable collection of manuscripts, incunabula, and other early printed German books, most of which form part of the Priebsch&#150;Closs collection of the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies of the University of London, while another portion, mainly sixteenth-century books, form a similarly named collection at Princeton University. He had a rare gift for friendship, dispensing gracious and generous hospitality and showing himself to be genuinely helpful towards his students. He was no facile popularizer; indeed his lectures were arduous for beginners, but his more advanced students soon came to appreciate his scrupulous scholarship and share the warm glow of his enthusiasm for his subject. Among his many distinguished pupils, of whom several became professors of German themselves, were his son-in-law, August Closs, professor at the University of Bristol from 1948 to 1964, Leonard Willoughby, at University College, London, from 1931 to 1950, Frederick Norman, at King's College, London, from 1937 to 1965, and William Edward Collinson, at the University of Liverpool from 1914 to 1954. Collinson collaborated with Priebsch on <span class="italic">The German Language</span> (1934), which ran to six editions by 1966. Priebsch's most important book was his study of Cotton manuscript <span class="roman">Caligula A.vii</span> of the Old Saxon Biblical poem <span class="italic">Heliand</span> (1925). His article on German in the eleventh edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> was a model of erudition. In 1905 he was a founding editor of the <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span>.<br>
<br>The First World War was a great blow to Priebsch, attached as he was to the countries mired in mutual enmity. He fell under suspicion, not least on account of his sending and receiving postcards containing what appeared to the British authorities to be highly suspect coded messages but which, in fact, were the shelfmarks of manuscripts in the British Museum. He was stripped of his status as a naturalized Briton under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. It was only with difficulty that his friends were able to arrange for him to receive a meagre pension on his retirement in 1931. Priebsch thought he might be able to pick up the threads of his former life in Austria, but he reckoned without the changes wrought by the First World War and its aftermath. In 1934 he moved to Dubrovnik on the Adriatic, but his health deteriorated and he returned to Vienna, dying of lung disease at the Perchtoldsdorf sanatorium on 25 May 1935. He was survived by his wife and daughter. His daughter married his pupil August Closs in 1931, and became an art critic and novelist. She published <span class="italic">Art and Life</span> (1936), the prose romance <span class="italic">Tristan</span> (1940), and three novels on the Albigensians: <span class="italic">High are the Mountains</span> (1945), <span class="italic">And Sombre are the Valleys</span> (1949; reissued <i>c</i>.1960 as <span class="italic">Deep are the Valleys</span>), and <span class="italic">The Silent Tarn</span> (1955), which were reissued as <span class="italic">The Tarn Trilogy</span> (1978).<br>
