<span class="headword">Adams,  Katharine</span>  (1862&#150;1952), <span class="occ">bookbinder</span>, was born on 25 November 1862 at Bracknell in Berkshire, the second daughter among the three children of the Revd William Fulford Adams (<i>d</i>. 1912) and his wife, Catherine Mary Horton (<i>bap</i>. 1830, <i>d</i>. 1912). As a child she lived at Little Faringdon, Oxfordshire, where her friends included William Morris's daughters, May and Jennie, and where she made some early experiments in bookbinding in cobbler's leather and in needlework. The connection with the Morris family proved useful when she began binding professionally during the 1890s. After a short period of training with Sarah Prideaux (1853&#150;1933) and T. J. Cobden-Sanderson (1840&#150;1922) in London in 1897, she set up a workshop in Lechlade, where her first commission came from Janey Morris. In 1901 she established the Eadburgh Bindery in Broadway, Gloucestershire. Adams initially worked alone, but was later able to employ two women assistants, whom she herself trained. For several years during this period she taught binding to the nuns at Stanbrook Abbey, although she was never quite reconciled either to the restrictions imposed upon the nuns or to the practical difficulty of teaching through a grille. She remained at Broadway until after her marriage to Edmund James Webb (1853&#150;1945), an independent scholar, on 25 November 1913. Late in 1915 she and her husband moved into Oxfordshire, living at Noke and Islip before returning to Gloucestershire in the 1930s. She continued to bind under her maiden name of Adams throughout this period; her last binding was completed only a few years before her death.<br>
<br>Adams's bindings were acclaimed from an early stage in her career, and (unlike many arts and crafts style bindings of the time) are still admired for their technical competence  (Lewis, 33). She took first prize in bookbinding at the Oxford arts and crafts exhibition of 1898, and was soon receiving regular commissions from the engraver and typographer Emery Walker (1851&#150;1933), St John Hornby (1867&#150;1946), and the bibliophile Sydney Cockerell (1867&#150;1962), who became a close friend. In the early years of the twentieth century she regularly exhibited both in London and abroad, showing her work not only in Belgium, France, and Germany, but as far afield as St Louis, Missouri, and Cape Town, South Africa, and winning several awards. She became the second president of the Women's Guild of Art, and in 1938 a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Important commissions included Queen Mary's psalter and <span class="italic">The Buildings of the British Museum</span>, presented to Queen Mary and George V respectively, the Ashendene Press <span class="italic">Tutte le opere di Dante Alighieri</span>, which has been described as &#145;possibly her finest binding&#146;  (Tidcombe, 139), and the Doves Press <span class="roman">Bible</span>, of which she and Cobden-Sanderson bound the only two copies printed on vellum. She was a highly accomplished gold finisher, described as a &#145;markedly individual&#146; designer, and &#145;one of the few binders of any date or country who made a success of pictorial designs in gold on leather&#146;  (Nixon, <span class="italic">Broxbourne Library</span>, 224). Intricate <i>pointill&eacute;</i> work was a particular feature of her style, and her attention to detail is apparent from a letter in which she wrote of one of her bindings:<blockquote>The effect of the dotted background was quite intentional. The effect of light on the gold can be varied by the angle at which the tool is used. That background was worked with the book upside down&#151;if you turn it, you will see the difference. (Lewis, 35)</blockquote>She designed many of her own finishing tools, including her signature tool: the initials KA in sanserif, separated by a catherine wheel. They are now in the British Library bindery, London.<br>
<br>Although Adams described herself as someone who &#145;felt rather keenly the ups and downs of life&#146;  (Tidcombe, 137), her letters give consistent evidence of the &#145;great charm and keen sense of humour&#146; mentioned in her obituary  (Cockerell). A photograph of Katharine Adams taken <i>c</i>.1930  (repr. Tidcombe), when she was aged about seventy, shows her with long grey hair swept back from her face, a broad forehead and high cheekbones, dark eyes, a steady gaze, and a firm but kind mouth. A less distinct photograph  (repr. Tidcombe) taken <i>c</i>.1905 shows her in profile, revealing a fairly short, perhaps slightly turned up nose, and a rather large chin. Her hair in the earlier photograph is dark, and caught up in a large coil at the back of her head. She died a widow at her home, The Cherries, St Briavels, Gloucestershire, on 15 October 1952, at the age of eighty-nine.<br>
