<span class="headword">Dempsey, Sir  Miles Christopher</span>  (1896&#150;1969), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in New Brighton, Cheshire, on 15 December 1896, son of Arthur Francis Dempsey, a marine insurance broker, and his wife, Margaret Maud De la Fosse. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Royal Berkshire regiment in 1915. He served with his regiment in France from 1916, when he commanded a company at the age of nineteen, to 1918; he was wounded, mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the MC. He subsequently took part in operations in Iraq (1919&#150;20). Between the wars he served both with his regiment and on the staff, at one time with Archibald Wavell as his divisional commander. At the outbreak of war in 1939, Dempsey was lieutenant-colonel in command of the 1st battalion of his regiment. During the battle for France he took command of 13th infantry brigade, which played a major part in the British counter-attack at Arras in May 1940; as a result of its contribution in a three-day battle in the Ypres and Comines Canal area, the British expeditionary force gained time for its withdrawal to Dunkirk. Dempsey was appointed to the DSO.<br>
<br>The next action which Dempsey saw was in the Middle East. Having been promoted lieutenant-general, he took command of 13th corps of the Eighth Army after the battle of El Alamein, and helped Sir Bernard Montgomery to plan the invasion of Sicily. His corps landed at Syracuse on 10 July 1943 and took part in the hard battle for Catania. During the descent on Italy itself, on 3 September 1943, his corps was in the spearhead, and Dempsey conducted the winter battles in southern Italy in a masterly fashion. But he did not remain there for long. Montgomery needed him for the coming invasion of western Europe, and in January 1944 he returned home to command the Second Army. His part in the battle for Normandy and the subsequent breakout, closing up to the Rhine, and finally advancing to the Elbe, was a model of how to conduct operations soundly and successfully. He was in many ways the ideal subordinate to Montgomery: never seeking the limelight, nor able (from the nature of Montgomery's directives) to indulge in bold strokes of initiative, he always fully understood what Montgomery's purpose was, and quietly and steadily got on with it. He would spend much of his time visiting his subordinate commanders and their troops, assessing the situation, listening to their problems, and giving instructions clearly and succinctly. He had profound understanding of the soldiers under his command and firm control over operations, so he inspired both subordinates and superior commanders with confidence in his judgement and leadership. Yet he remained relatively unknown to the public.<br>
<br>Dempsey was very good at understanding a battlefield; a map became a relief map in his hand. His sound, albeit cautious establishment of the initial bridgehead was followed by the application of ever-growing pressure in the Caen sector. His conduct of the battle was governed by the knowledge that the breakout was to be by the Americans in the western flank of the bridgehead; he therefore went on hitting away at the Germans, drawing more and more of their strength against his own army. He was determined to take Caen, since its capture would, as he put it, &#145;loosen the enemy's hinge and provide us with a firm hinge&#146;. During the subsequent operations in the latter part of July 1944, which led to the American breakout and the subsequent Falaise and Argentan battles which broke the German positions in Normandy, Dempsey was always ready to take advantage of the opportunity to exploit success, but never tried to reinforce stalemate. He would also wholeheartedly accept responsibility for taking critical decisions, without worrying if the efforts of the army were misinterpreted by the press or senior allied commanders. He was quite unperturbed when there were suggestions that operation Goodwood (which was designed to draw more German Panzers away from General Omar Bradley's First Army) had been a failure, and he merely pointed out that such misunderstandings would help with the deception plan. After the breakout in Normandy, Dempsey's army conducted difficult and deliberate winter operations in Belgium (it was during a visit to the front at this time that George VI dubbed him KCB, an appointment which had been gazetted in June 1944), and established itself at the Rhine by March 1945; in the subsequent advance to the Elbe his army was in the forefront, and he himself received the surrender of Hamburg on 3 May 1945.<br>
<br>When the European war was over Dempsey was appointed commander of the Fourteenth Army for the reoccupation of Singapore and Malaya, in succession to Sir William Slim, whom he also followed as commander-in-chief, allied land forces, south-east Asia, until 1946 when he was promoted to the rank of general. He was appointed KBE in 1945. In 1946&#150;7 he was commander-in-chief Middle East, and he retired in July 1947 at his own request. In 1948 he married Viola Mary Vivien, youngest daughter of Captain Percy O'Reilly, of Colamber, co. Westmeath; they had no children.<br>
<br>After his retirement Dempsey joined a number of companies: he was a director of H. and G. Simonds, and chairman in 1953&#150;63; he was also chairman of Greene, King &amp; Sons in 1955&#150;67, and deputy chairman of Courage, Barclay, and Simonds in 1961&#150;6. But he derived especial pleasure from chairing the Racecourse Betting Control Board (1947&#150;51). He had always been an excellent horseman, and was very fond of hunting and racing; he bred and raced his own horses, and once commented that his position on the Racecourse Betting Control Board enhanced his enjoyment of racing all the more for knowing that it was also his duty to be there. Nor did he sever his connection with the army: he was colonel commandant of the corps of Royal Military Police in 1947&#150;57, and of the Special Air Service in 1951&#150;60. He was also colonel of his regiment, the Royal Berkshires, in 1946&#150;56, and a deputy lieutenant for Berkshire from 1950. He was commander-in-chief (designate), UK land forces, in 1951&#150;6, and was appointed GBE on his retirement from this post.<br>
<br>Dempsey, who was nicknamed Bimbo, had many interests: he was a student of military history with a remarkable memory, and he loved music, both playing the piano and singing. At Shrewsbury School he had captained the first eleven, and later at Staff College he had played cricket&#151;he was left-handed&#151;with Thomas Troubridge, who was afterwards his naval colleague for the invasion of Sicily. Tall, lean, and tough, a man of considerable charm and modesty, young-looking and always immaculately turned out, he radiated confidence and authority. Dempsey died at his home, Coombe House, Yattendon, near Newbury, Berkshire, on 5 June 1969.<br>
