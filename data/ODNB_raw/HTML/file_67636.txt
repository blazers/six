<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies,  Frances Mary Jemima Woodhill <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1861&#150;1934), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born at Bou&euml;t, St Peter Port, Guernsey, on 27 June 1861, the first child of Alfred Arnold Davies (<i>b</i>. 1829/30), a schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Jemima Woodhill (<i>b</i>. 1830), the daughter of a gifted amateur cellist. At an early age Fanny was sent to Birmingham to live with her aunt, Eliza Woodhill, who ran a thriving girls' school. Fanny began piano lessons there and gave her first public performance in Birmingham town hall at the age of six, but otherwise was exempt from the life of a prodigy. She later studied the piano and harmony with noted local teachers Charles Flavell and Alfred Gaul; she also learned the violin with Henry Hayward (&#145;the Wolverhampton Paganini&#146;), who instilled in her a love of chamber music.<br>
<br>Owing to delicate lungs Davies spent two winters indoors, studying music. Pianistically she was first inspired by Arabella Goddard, whom she heard in Birmingham in 1870. Encouraged by Charles Hall&eacute;, she went to Leipzig in 1882 to study with Carl Reinecke and Oscar Paul, but a year later she fulfilled her dream of studying with Clara Schumann, enrolling at the Hoch Conservatorium in Frankfurt in September 1883.<br>
<br>Returning to England in 1885, Davies made her London d&eacute;but at the Crystal Palace on 17 October, performing Beethoven's fourth piano concerto and some solos by Schumann and C. H. Graun. A month later she made her first appearance in the Monday Popular Concerts, playing solo and chamber music. At a time when pupils of Liszt such as Sophie Menter were dazzling audiences with muscular virtuosity, Davies's more restrained manner caused the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> to hail her as &#145;a legitimate, as opposed to phenomenal or eccentric&#146; pianist  (<span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, 26, 1885, 656&#150;7). She went on to enjoy a successful career as a soloist and a chamber musician in England and abroad, performing extensively in Europe both before and after the First World War. An important influence in her early career was the violinist Joseph Joachim; with the cellist Alfredo Piatti they formed a trio, giving six performances in the &#145;Popular&#146; concerts of 1885&#150;6. Fanny Davies also performed in the Joachim Quartet concerts in 1906. She remained committed to the music of Schumann and Brahms, regularly performing their concertos and major solo works. She gave the first performance of Brahms's D minor violin sonata, op. 108, in Berlin with Joachim and introduced the <span class="italic">Klavierst&uuml;cke</span>, opp. 116 and 117, to English audiences. In addition, she took part in the first performances of Brahms's clarinet trio, op. 114, and the clarinet sonatas, op. 120, with their dedicatee, Richard M&uuml;hlfeld (1856&#150;1907).<br>
<br>Davies also championed music by English composers: in 1886 she performed Sterndale Bennett's piano concerto at a Philharmonic Concert, and she was the dedicatee of Elgar's bravura <span class="italic">Concert Allegro</span>, op. 46. She explored both early and contemporary English repertory, as well as early Netherlandish and Italian keyboard music. According to Benton Fletcher  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Sept 1934) she owned a 1762 Tschudi harpsichord, though she did not perform publicly on it.<br>
<br>As a chamber musician Fanny Davies performed with some of the greatest artists of the day. In 1907 she undertook a concert tour of Germany with the tenor Gervase Elwes, whose singing of Brahms lieder was well received. She played with the Ros&eacute; Quartet in Vienna in 1897 and later joined forces with the Bohemian String Quartet, championing music by Czech composers. In Prague she was hailed as &#145;the Daviesov&aacute;&#146; by an enchanted critic. She was also a friend of the cellist Pablo Casals, who invited her to play with his orchestra in Barcelona in 1923.<br>
<br>A prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of Clara Schumann, Davies maintained her teacher's principles throughout her life, despite a rift with the family in 1893&#150;4. She maintained warm friendships with fellow Schumann pupils such as Leonard Borwick and Mathilde Verne, and with them and others marked the Schumann centenary in 1910 with a gala concert. She also contributed articles on Schumann and Brahms to <span class="italic">Cobbett's Cyclopedia of Chamber Music</span> (1929).<br>
<br>Davies was also a sought-after teacher. Pupils found her demanding but supportive, and a former headmistress of the Francis Holland School, London, which still has a Fanny Davies prize, remembered the pianist as &#145;a sparkling raconteuse with an inexhaustible fund of anecdotes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 6 Sept 1934). She was president of the Society of Women Musicians from 1925 to 1926&#151;an apt choice as she had played with most of the leading women instrumentalists of the day. She had connections with Steinway from fairly early on, and was invited by them to record on piano rolls for the Welte-Mignon Company in 1909. They continued to support her, supplying pianos even in remote places, a privilege granted to only a select few. She later recorded for the Columbia Graphophone Company.<br>
<br>A popular performer at private concerts, Davies was famous for her party trick of imitating the mannerisms of contemporary pianists. Edward Speyer, who knew her from the beginning of her career, commented on her formidable memory which had so impressed Casals, and her ability to play for hours in private and congenial company without fatigue. Dorothy Mayer recalled &#145;the dreamy warmth&#146; of her playing, as well as her &#145;lively sense of the ridiculous, and combination of whimsy and dignity&#146;  (Mayer, 776&#150;9). Never married, she lived for some time with her companion Harriette Grist and had a wide circle of friends. A warm-hearted and exuberant woman, she was undaunted by her small stature, and &#145;small hands not ideally suited to piano playing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Sept 1934).<br>
<br>Davies remained professionally active until near the end of her life, when she suffered a stroke and was moved into a west London nursing home at 25 Leinster Square, where she died on 1 September 1934. The obituarist in the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span> (3 September 1934) described her as a &#145;personal messenger for Schumann and Brahms&#146;, which was perhaps her main legacy to twentieth-century pianism, though she was also an exponent of later composers such as Debussy and Granados. In an interview published in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> of June 1905 she stated that &#145;Clara Schumann's aim was to be technically perfect but never to think too much of the instrument and too little of the music&#146;  (46.370). It was a tradition she maintained to the end.<br>
