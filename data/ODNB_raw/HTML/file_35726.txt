<span class="headword">Rendel,  George Wightwick</span>  (1833&#150;1902), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 6 February 1833 at Plymouth, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23364/', "James Meadows Rendel (1799&#150;1856)")</script>, civil engineer, and his wife, Catherine Jane, daughter of James Harris of Dartmouth. Named after the distinguished architect George Wightwick, his father's lifelong friend, he was educated at Harrow School, but ran away due to a perceived injustice in 1849. Initially he was sent to Grimsby, where his father was engaged in building the Great Grimsby Royal docks (1844&#150;53). Later he joined his father and his elder brother Lewis Rendel (1830&#150;1851) at Holyhead, where they were building the eastern breakwater and new Admiralty pier. He was then apprenticed to his father's great friend, Sir William Armstrong, at his Elswick works, Newcastle upon Tyne, living with Armstrong for a period of three years. He completed his training as an engineer in his father's London office, engaged upon the design of the superstructure of great bridges across the Ganges and Jumna at Allahabad being built for the East Indian Railway.<br>
<br>Following his father's death in 1856 it was decided the business could support only one son. The eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35725/', "Alexander Rendel (1829&#150;1918)")</script>, took over the business and, sponsored by Robert Stephenson, continued as consulting engineer to the East Indian Railway. George Rendel, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37889/', "Stuart Rendel (1834&#150;1913)")</script>, and Hamilton Rendel (1843&#150;1902) all joined Armstrong, who henceforth treated them like adopted sons.<br>
<br>In 1859 George Rendel became a partner and manager of Armstrong's Elswick Ordnance Company. Later, in 1860, Captain Andrew Noble was appointed joint manager with Rendel. In 1864 Rendel was a signatory to the deed merging the ordnance works and the engine works to form Sir W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co. Stuart Rendel, a barrister and later a notable Liberal politician, whose daughter married Gladstone's son Henry Neville Gladstone, managed Armstrongs' London office until 1883. Hamilton Rendel disliked public life and remained quietly with the firm, dedicated to engineering. Probably his most notable achievement was the machinery for London's Tower Bridge.<br>
<br>During his twenty-four years at Elswick, George Rendel was engaged upon the development, construction, and armament of many warships, especially the design of their gun mountings. He was responsible for the hydraulic systems of mounting and working heavy guns first tried in 1877 in HMS <i>Thunderer</i>. Later his designs were used in the admiral class battleships, and soon his hydraulic systems were employed in all British, and some foreign, navy warships.<br>
<br>He was responsible for the introduction to the world of the cruiser type of warship, designed to act as scouts and to fight in fleet actions as secondary line-of-battle ships. In 1881 he designed, for the Chilean and Chinese governments, a series of 1350 ton unarmoured cruisers, protection being offered by light steel decks and coal bunkers. These were followed by the 3000 tons displacement, 18 knots cruiser <i>Esmeralda</i> for the Chilean navy. This was the first vessel to be fitted with a steel protective deck.<br>
<br>Rendel and Alfred Yarrow were pioneers in the use of boiler-room forced-draught fans and totally enclosed stokeholds in warships, which dramatically improved their speed and performance. Rendel was responsible also for the design of the twin-screw Staunch class gunboats, and up until 1885 about twenty similar vessels were built. In 1871 Rendel was appointed a member of the British government committee on warship design. He played a major role in the 1877 design of the 11,880 tons displacement HMS <i>Inflexible</i>, which carried four 80 ton, muzzle-loading, rifled guns and armour plates 24 inches thick.<br>
<br>Rendel was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1863, and in 1874 contributed a paper entitled &#145;Gun carriages and mechanical appliances for working of heavy ordnance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers</span>, vol. 38, 85), for which he was awarded a Watt medal and premium. In 1871 he was awarded the Spanish order of Carlos III, and in 1876 the order of the Cross of Italy. He was elected a member of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1879, and became a vice-president in 1882.<br>
<br>In 1882 Rendel was invited to become an extra-professional civil lord of the Admiralty, a new post allowing the admission of a &#145;practical man-of-science&#146; to the board. Leaving Armstrongs, Rendel became greatly respected by his colleagues on the board, and it was with great regret that ill health forced his retirement in 1885. His doctors advised that he should live in a warmer climate.<br>
<br>His first wife, Harriet, daughter of Joseph Simpson, British vice-consul at Kronstadt, whom he had married on 13 December 1860 and with whom he had five sons, died in 1878. In 1880 he met and married Licinia Pinelli (1846/7&#150;1934) in Rome, while serving on an Italian ministry of marine warship design committee. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1885 Rendel rejoined Armstrong and, upon the latter's suggestion, agreed to establish a new ordnance factory at Pozzuoli, near Naples, in 1887, with Admiral Count Albini as joint managing director. Rendel's residence at Posilippo soon became a centre of social activity and it was here he offered hospitality to the ailing and recently widowed Empress Frederick of Germany. She was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria, and the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. He established also very cordial relations with Lord Rosebery.<br>
<br>Rendel retired to Sandown, Isle of Wight, in 1900 and spent the last two years of his life confined to a wheelchair. He died at his home, Broadlands, in Sandown on 9 October 1902 and, although not a Roman Catholic, was buried in accordance with his wishes at the Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery in London. It is said that George Rendel sometimes lacked the commercial instinct of his brother Stuart, but he undoubtedly combined lucidity of intellect and general sagacity with the engineer's exceptional fertile faculty of invention.<br>
