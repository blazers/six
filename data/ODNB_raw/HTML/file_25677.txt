<span class="headword">Skinner,  James</span>  (1818&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born at Forfar, Scotland, on 23 June 1818, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25681/', "John Skinner (1769&#150;1841)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25679/', "Skinner, John (1744&#150;1816)")</script>], dean of Dunkeld and Dunblane in the Scottish Episcopal church, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Provost Ure of Forfar. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25679/', "John Skinner (1744&#150;1816)")</script>, bishop of Aberdeen. In 1832 Skinner entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, and in the following year, when Durham University was first opened, he was admitted as a foundation scholar. He graduated BA in 1836 and MA in 1840, and was a fellow from 1844 to 1849. From 1839 to 1841 he was a master at King William's College, Isle of Man, where he soon gained a reputation as &#145;a violent <span class="roman">Oxford Tract</span> party man&#146;.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon on 27 June 1841 and priest in the year following, Skinner was successively curate of Burton Agnes in Yorkshire and of Holy Trinity, Windsor (during 1844); chaplain of the district military prison at Southsea Castle (from July 1845); and curate of St Mary's, Reading, from 1846. On 18 July 1848 he married Agnes, daughter of Oliver Raymond, vicar of Middleton, Essex. They had a daughter, Agnes Raymond, who died in 1868.<br>
<br>As his health was deteriorating, Skinner accepted the post of chaplain to the forces in Corfu, but in 1850 he returned to England. In 1851 he was appointed senior curate of St Barnabas, Pimlico, London, by its vicar, Robert Liddell. Since November 1850 this new church with its then advanced ceremonial practices had been notorious as the target of persistent riots, occasioned by the popular outcry against Tractarians as a result of the &#145;papal aggression&#146; crisis. As a consequence the church's founding vicar, W. J. E. Bennett, had been forced to resign. Skinner, with the help of Liddell and support from his junior curate, Charles Lowder, persisted with these controversial practices, defending them at length in his sermon <span class="italic">Why do we Prize Externals in the Service of God?</span> (1856) and in the law courts. However, in 1856 failing health forced him to resign.<br>
<br>After an interval in which he was engaged with the organization of the English Church Union, in 1861 Skinner accepted the living of the tiny parish of Newland, near Great Malvern, Worcestershire, and the wardenship of the almshouses for retired agricultural labourers situated there. He quickly increased the frequency with which holy communion was celebrated, built a new parish church in 1864, and steadily developed Newland as a spiritual centre attracting clergy and laity from all over the country for retreats or spiritual and pastoral advice. At this time he also published a number of important works, including <span class="italic">The Daily Service Hymnal</span> (1864) and <span class="italic">A Plea for the Threatened Ritual of the Church of England</span> (1865) in support of the new generation of ritualists. In 1877 poor health once again obliged him to move, this time to Ascot, where his final years were spent assisting Pusey. He died at Bath on 29 December 1881, and was buried in the churchyard at Newland; his wife survived him.<br>
