<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  John Joseph Tate</span>  (1769/70&#150;1846), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was the first of the five surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29430/', "Tate Wilkinson (1739&#150;1803)")</script>, the manager of the York circuit of theatres, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Doughty. Already from 1797 a member of the company, Wilkinson assumed its management on his father's death and, although his active role ended with his bankruptcy in 1814, he remained closely associated with and financially dependent on the (diminishing) circuit until his own death in 1846.<br>
<br>According to his father's memoirs, <span class="italic">The Wandering Patentee</span>, Wilkinson had &#145;a genteel education&#146; and was &#145;proficient a little in music&#146;. Sometimes he would supplement an evening's bill by dancing a minuet. However he was &#145;too diffident&#146; to shine on the stage, despite being a favourite with a perennial patron, the countess of Mexborough. He never performed with the regularity of the majority of the company and rarely took a leading role: he customarily played Paris in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, doubled as Tyrrel and the duke of Norfolk in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, and took the role of Cromwell in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>. But he made the part of the eponymous George Barnwell his own, chose Blusherly in Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The Natural Son</span> for one of his benefits, and appeared most frequently as Jack O'Connor in O'Keefe's <span class="italic">Prisoner at Large</span>.<br>
<br>In February 1794 Wilkinson married Sarah Maria Reynolds (1771/2&#150;1832), who had first come from Covent Garden to play with the company in November 1790, and who was a permanent member from January 1792 onwards. Both before and after her marriage she performed far more often than Wilkinson himself, her preferred roles including Polly in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> and Rosetta in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>.<br>
<br>Initially John Wilkinson's management was little different from his father's&#151;the company progressed on the same basis from Hull to York, Leeds, Pontefract, Wakefield, and Doncaster in the course of the year&#151;but he obtained fewer bespeaks, engaged fewer stars, and began, in an effort to retain audiences, to mount more extravagant spectacles. By 1809 there were reports of his financial difficulties, and Pontefract was dropped from the circuit. At the same time, having been criticized for the condition of his Hull theatre, Wilkinson contracted with the Hull corporation for &pound;1260 to buy land for a new one in Humber Street; he made a down payment of &pound;500 and agreed to pay interest at 5 per cent on the remainder. His new theatre, capable of holding 1700 and designed by Charles Mountain the younger, was financed by subscriptions and opened on 1 May 1810 with Stephen Kemble in James Thomson's <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span>. But Dorothy Jordan, writing from Wakefield in 1811, complained that Wilkinson did not have the money to pay her. In 1813 the Leeds theatre, in Hunslet Lane, the only one in the circuit to which Wilkinson had the absolute title, was offered unproductively for sale. Later the same year the circuit was advertised, abortively, as to be auctioned as a whole.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's bankruptcy in 1814 placed the administration of the circuit in the hands of trustees at York and at Hull, where they represented the interests of the shareholders in the new theatre. Wilkinson held the key assets of the royal patents for Hull and York, the freehold of the Leeds theatre, a financial stake in the theatre at Hull, and leases&#151;for various periods of time and on various conditions&#151;for the theatres at Doncaster, Wakefield, and York. While the circuit was sub-let to a series of actor&#150;managers, and Doncaster and Wakefield were lost in the 1830s, Wilkinson was able to retire, with his wife, three of his four daughters, and his son, to live a quiet life as an independent gentleman at Acomb, York, drawing an income principally from rents paid by sub-lessees and from the annual, and often lucrative, benefits held on his behalf. Wilkinson died at his home in Front Street, Acomb, on 20 January 1846.<br>
