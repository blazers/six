<span class="headword">Stanbury,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1474), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was the second son of Walter Stanbury of Morwenstow, Cornwall, and his wife, Cicely. After entering the Carmelite order he was educated at its Oxford convent, becoming DTh and gaining a reputation for outstanding scholarship. An impressive list of writings, mostly on canon law, is attributed to him by John Bale; none of these has survived, but they may help to explain why Henry VI chose him to be his confessor, some time before 1440. Stanbury has frequently been mentioned in connection with the foundation of Eton College, but the link, if any, is unclear&#151;he is not named in documents relating to the foundation of Eton, although as the king's confessor and a noted scholar he may well have acted in some advisory role. He would appear to have been highly regarded by his order, since in 1446 he represented the Oxford <i>distinctio</i> at the general chapter held in Rome for the reformation of the Carmelites. Early in that year the king nominated Stanbury for the see of Norwich, and he was elected by the monks; but Walter Lyhert (<i>d</i>. 1472), a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of William de la Pole, marquess of Suffolk, was papally provided on 24 July. Denied Norwich, Stanbury was provided to the poor see of Bangor on 4 March 1448, and consecrated by Archbishop John Stafford on 20 June. He rarely if ever visited his diocese, but bequeathed &pound;30 to the fabric of its cathedral in his will. Constantly in attendance at court, he shared the unpopularity of Henry VI's ministers, and is mentioned as &#145;Frere Stanbury&#146; in a song of Cade's followers in Kent in 1450.<br>
<br>On 7 February 1453 Stanbury was translated to Hereford, where he was enthroned on 25 April, but as he continued to act as the king's confessor he was very seldom seen in his new diocese. Between 1453 and 1457 he was frequently present at meetings of the king's council, while in January 1457 he was nominated to the council of the prince of Wales. Loyal to Henry VI, Stanbury was arrested shortly after the battle of Northampton (10 July 1460), and briefly imprisoned in Warwick Castle. He attended the first session of Edward IV's first parliament on 4 November 1461, but it is unlikely that he came to any parliament or great council thereafter. On 21 April 1462 he was granted permission to resign his see (perhaps he had been persuaded to ask), on the grounds that he was &#145;so old and weak&#146;, but in the event he remained bishop. Early in 1463 he intervened in the election to the deanship of Hereford, quashing that of John ap Richard and then collating his own vicar-general, Richard Pede, to the office. Thereafter Stanbury seems to have been conventionally, if rather intermittently, active as bishop, though in 1472 a number of heresy trials took place before him. He supported the readeption of Henry VI, but was subsequently pardoned by Edward IV. Stanbury died in the Carmelite house at Ludlow on 11 May 1474 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral, where a beautifully carved alabaster monument with an inscription was erected over his tomb. His episcopal ring and the vestments in which he was buried were discovered during architectural alterations in 1844.<br>
