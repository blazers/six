</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tumim, Sir  Stephen</span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">judge and prison inspector</span>, was born on 15 August 1930 at 10 Basing Hill, Golders Green, Hendon, Middlesex, the second son of Joseph Tumim (1895&#150;1957), barrister, and his wife, (Edna) Ren&eacute;e, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis (1902&#150;1941), daughter of Nathaniel Davis, architect. Both families were of Jewish descent. On the outbreak of the Second World War the Tumims moved to Old Headington, Oxford. Tumim's father became clerk of assize to the Oxford circuit, and was appointed CBE in 1953 and a deputy chairman of Oxford quarter sessions in 1954. When Tumim was ten his mother, an artistically gifted woman who had trained at the Slade, died unexpectedly from septicaemia caused by a needle prick while working on an embroidery. This deeply and lastingly affected him. Educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, he entered Worcester College, Oxford, as a history scholar but later switched to jurisprudence, graduating with a second-class degree in 1953. Called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1955, he dealt mainly with divorce, landlord and tenant disputes, and contract disputes between artists or musicians and their agents. On 1 February 1962 he married Winifred Letitia Borthwick [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102319/', "Tumim, Winifred Letitia (1936&#150;2009)")</script>], daughter of Algernon Malcolm Borthwick, chairman of the family meat-importing business. Tumim's wife was, like him, an Oxford graduate and a person of great energy and commitment to philanthropic causes. They had three daughters, two being profoundly deaf. Tumim was chairman of the National Deaf Children's Society from 1974 to 1979.<br>
<br>On medical advice Tumim had not applied for silk. He became a recorder (part-time judge) of the crown court in 1977 and one year later a full-time circuit judge. He was a &#145;light sentencer&#146;. His experience of dealing with criminal cases was short-lived, for in 1980 he was appointed a judge of Willesden county court where he dealt exclusively with civil disputes, gaining a reputation for courtesy and fair dealing from those who appeared before him, including a growing number of persons from ethnic minorities. He had also been president of the mental health review tribunals.<br>
<br>From the relative obscurity of Willesden county court, Tumim was, in 1987, appointed as the third chief inspector of prisons by Douglas Hurd, the home secretary, on the recommendation of Sir Brian Cubbon, the permanent under-secretary of state. At the time his appointment came as a surprise to those who had hoped to see the office of her majesty's chief inspector being taken up by someone with an established reputation as a fighter for prisoners' rights and a radical approach to prison reform. Tumim appeared to be the quintessential &#145;establishment&#146; safe choice: a member of the Garrick and Beefsteak clubs, he enjoyed the company of politicians, artists, writers, and senior civil servants, who appreciated his urbanity, sense of humour, and fine appreciation of literature and painting. Outwardly he appeared somewhat eccentric&#151;&#145;Pickwickian&#146; some said&#151;with half-moon spectacles, bright bow tie, and a rather &#145;vague and wistful manner&#146;  (Ronald Harwood, memorial service address, 4 May 2004). From an early age he had collected books, his library eventually totalling 10,000 volumes. He especially appreciated Trollope, Johnson, and Sterne, and had published two miscellanies of legal anecdotes: <span class="italic">Great Legal Disasters</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">Great Legal Fiascos</span> (1985). Between 1983 and 1990 he was chairman of the Friends of the Tate Gallery and for the last ten years of his life he was president of the Royal Literary Fund.<br>
<br>The establishment of a fully independent chief inspector of prisons, a crown appointment responsible directly to the home secretary, had been recommended in 1979 by the committee of inquiry into the United Kingdom prison service, chaired by Sir John May. Although independent prison inspectors had been appointed in 1835, the home office had appeared perfectly satisfied, since the nationalization of local prisons in 1877, with prison inspectors promoted from the governor ranks to membership of what became the Prisons Board, whose reports were for &#145;internal&#146; consumption and thus never published. In contrast, the May committee wanted the prison service to be &#145;opened up to as wide an audience as possible&#146;. The terms of reference given to the chief inspector by the home secretary were to inspect and report &#145;in particular on conditions in those establishments; the treatment of prisoners and other inmates and the facilities available to them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of HM Chief Inspector of Prisons</span>, 1981, para. 1.03).<br>
<br>Tumim's predecessors, Bill Pearce, a former chief probation officer, who died after only a year in post, and Sir James Hennessy, a diplomat, had revealed plenty of inadequacies in the prison system. But their work had received almost no public attention. Reviewing progress at the end of his tenure, Sir James noted &#145;a period of slow but steady development, during which the independence and objectivity of the conduct of inspections, sought by the May Committee, have become firmly established&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of HM Chief Inspector of Prisons</span>, 1986, para. 7.02). This &#145;bedding-down period&#146;  (ibid., para. 7.03) came abruptly to an end when Tumim was appointed in 1987. He was well aware that it was easier said than done to maintain his independence: first because the inspectorate was a very small organization given the size of the task, secondly because many of his staff were seconded from the prison service and would return to it, but most importantly because the civil servants who advised ministers on the recommendations made by the inspectorate were also from the prison department and were therefore, as Tumim put it, &#145;judges in their own cause&#146;. He knew there was no easy way round this, save that the inspectorate should gain such a &#145;reputation for reliability, impartiality, good judgement and truth&#146; that its recommendations would rarely be rejected  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, 1986, signed by Tumim, paras. 7.04&#150;7.07). Indeed, when reflecting on how he, as a judge, had approached the &#145;heart of his job, a decision as to what prisons are about&#146;, he had concluded that a chief inspector &#145;is not by occupation a reformer or controversialist or even a publicist. His job is to advise on general issues&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, April 1993 &#150; March 1994, preface, 1). That had been the theory, but in fact he soon became all three. He moved rapidly from mere inspector and reporter to influential prison reformer, for criticism was allied to a vision of how decent and progressive prisons should be run.<br>
<br>Tumim began by inspecting Liverpool and Pentonville prisons. What he discovered appalled him, and he decided immediately to &#145;instigate entirely fresh work on the introduction of integral sanitation&#146; so as to bring as rapid an end as possible to the disgusting practice of &#145;slopping-out&#146; urine and faeces from cell buckets every morning  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, 1987, para. 5.02). By December 1988 a &#145;thematic review&#146; had been completed with a plan to achieve access to sanitation twenty-four hours a day for all prisoners within seven years, a task the prison department had estimated would take until 2017. Secondly he instituted a series of &#145;short inspections&#146; so that action could be more swiftly taken on problems occurring over a wider range of establishments. Furthermore, he resolved to concentrate on &#145;treatment and conditions&#146;, noting &#145;consumer reactions to them&#146;, rather than spending time on issues of security and organization, which were more the responsibility of governors and regional directors  (ibid., paras. 5.03&#150;5.04). He carved for himself a special role in inspections, namely to gather views from prisoners rather than from officials. He was determined to overcome the delays (sometimes as long as seven months) in the publication by the Home Office of the inspector's reports, which had often allowed the authorities to deflect criticism by claiming that whatever had been discovered at the inspection had by now been remedied&#151;although Tumim himself was careful not to accuse the prison authorities of such a sinister motive.<br>
<br>Tumim quickly became aware that the majority of prisoners were uneducated and disadvantaged young men, most of whom &#145;had committed offences relating to drugs or cars or drink&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, April 1993 &#150; March 1994, preface, 1). In a memorable passage he wrote: &#145;Young offenders constitute the biggest problem &hellip; We are fully conscious that they are offenders but remain far less conscious that they are young&#146;. They needed &#145;to gain a stake in society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, April 1994 &#150; March 1995, introduction, xvii). That could, in his view, only be achieved by ensuring decent conditions, humane treatment, and a moral agenda that would preserve human dignity and seek to educate and enlighten prisoners&#151;he was especially keen to encourage artistic gifts and art therapy through the Koestler Trust&#151;in preparation for their eventual release. He despised bullying and &#145;regimented and unconstructive&#146; regimes that enforced idleness or provided only &#145;soulless employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, 1989, para. 3.01 and January 1990 &#150; March 1991, para. 6.41). But he was far from being sentimental: &#145;It is important to remember that if it is to be effective, the help given to prisoners must be sharp and urgent and based on an active life-style. Rewards and punishments must have a place as in other institutions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, April 1994 &#150; March 1995, introduction, xviii). In reality he found many prison staff and prisoners caught in a trap of low expectations, a condition he described as &#145;a deadening experience for both groups&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, 1989, para. 2.01) and one that would not be solved &#145;until the Prison Service is able to believe that [it] can be resolved &hellip;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, 1990&#150;91, 1992&#150;3). He was quick to encourage with praise whenever he found an institution with a positive regime.<br>
<br>In 1990, he joined Lord Woolf in considering the lessons to be learned from the latter's monumental inquiry into the serious riots that had taken place at Manchester and other prisons. Their joint report (pt 2 of the Woolf report, 1991) was a landmark in setting a new agenda for the prison service. Yet the emphasis was less on Tumim's rather paternalistic conception of rehabilitation and more on the need to create a proper balance between the maintenance of security and control and ensuring justice for prisoners through a system of &#145;contracts&#146;. He was enthusiastic about the government white paper <span class="italic">Custody, Care and Justice</span>, which embodied many of the recommendations of the report.<br>
<br>Tumim courted the media, including advising and assisting programme researchers, and regularly appeared on the BBC <span class="italic">Today</span> programme and television to publicize his reports. So successful was he that he became a household name&#151;a fearless, yet moderate, proponent of an approach that appealed to a wide range of liberally minded citizens who never before had considered what prisons were for or what the majority of prisoners were like. There was something in it, when he was described on BBC Radio 4's <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> as &#145;a revolutionary masquerading as an old buffer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 12 Dec 2003). His celebrity status nevertheless had its drawbacks. It was discovered that he was high up on the IRA's hit-list. So seriously was the threat taken that he and his wife had to sell their London home on the Thames and move to a more easily guarded house. For two years he was driven everywhere in an armoured car with police escort, and visitors to his country cottage were greeted by men carrying sub-machine guns. It was typical of him that he carried on with great good humour.<br>
<br>In 1995 the home secretary, Michael Howard, who was taking a tougher line on prisons, decided not to extend further Tumim's appointment. Tumim was undoubtedly very disappointed, but he had changed dramatically the role and standing of the prisons inspectorate, laying a foundation for his successors to build on. In 1996 he was knighted and was excited by his appointment as principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Popular with the students, he nevertheless began to lose the confidence of the fellowship. He was not the fund-raiser they had hoped for, nor was he regarded as good at college administration. Furthermore he was at odds with some senior members. Always outspoken, his views about them got back to the college and in 1998 he resigned after a vote of no confidence. A lesser personality would have been crushed, but he kept up his public speaking and writing on prison matters (an essay, <span class="italic">Crime and Punishment</span>, was published in 1997) and was an active patron, trustee, or committee member of many organizations, including the ex-prisoners' charity Unlock. He received eleven honorary degrees as well as several fellowships, including an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He was especially tickled and honoured by his appointment in 1995 to the ancient title of high steward of Wallingford. He died suddenly on 8 December 2003, while swimming, during a holiday in the Galapagos Islands, and was survived by his wife and their three daughters.<br>
