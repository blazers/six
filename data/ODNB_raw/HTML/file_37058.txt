<span class="headword">Yarrow, Sir  Alfred Fernandez</span>, first baronet  (1842&#150;1932), <span class="occ">marine engineer and shipbuilder</span>, was born at 2 Bury Court, St Mary Axe, London, on 13 January 1842, the elder and only surviving son of the merchant Edgar Williams Yarrow (<i>bap</i>. 1805) of Barnsbury, London, and his wife, Esther Lindo (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Moses Lindo, a West Indies merchant. He was of Jewish descent on his mother's side and his parents' courtship was prolonged by his mother's reluctance to upset her family by marrying a Christian. The marriage only took place, in Holborn, London, in late 1838, after her parents' death. Yarrow's relationship with his mother was one of mutual devotion and was particularly intense after his father's death and in the early stages of his business career.<br>
<br>Educated privately and at University College School, London, Yarrow was apprenticed to the firm of Ravenhill, Salkeld &amp; Co., marine engine builders, at the age of fifteen. In these early years he spent much time with his friend James Hilditch, who shared his practical and inventive turn of mind. They attended Michael Faraday's lectures at the Royal Institution and installed a private telegraph line between their homes. Together they patented several inventions in 1861, including a steam carriage and a steam plough. One consequence was that Yarrow became the London representative of a firm of agricultural engineers while he continued to seek new business opportunities.<br>
<br>In 1865 Yarrow went into partnership with a Mr Hedley, establishing a works at Folly Wall, Isle of Dogs, Poplar, London. Initially a general engineering concern, the repair of river vessels led them to build steam launches in substantial numbers from 1868. The partnership with Hedley was dissolved in 1875 and on 24 March of that year Yarrow married Minnie Florence Franklin (1852/3&#150;1922). They had three daughters and three sons; the youngest son was killed in action in 1915.<br>
<br>Yarrow rapidly developed the business after 1875. Shallow-draught river and lake boats, such as the <i>Ilala</i>, were built for use in Africa, and vessels were generally prefabricated for easy carriage and reassembly on site. The enthusiasm for torpedo boats by the world's navies was a huge boost to Yarrows and the subsequent development of destroyers was equally beneficial. The Yarrow water tube boiler, a design of classic simplicity, was another development, stemming from dissatisfaction with the performance of existing boilers. They were installed in warships from 1887 and found to be lighter and more economical.<br>
<br>In 1897 the business was incorporated as a limited liability company, Yarrow &amp; Co. Ltd. Despite the success that the company enjoyed, Yarrow perceived that the Thames was in decline as a shipbuilding river and that a move was necessary in order to remain competitive. Between 1906 and 1908 the enterprise was moved to Scotstoun, on the River Clyde, a site chosen after careful deliberation. The choice may well have been influenced by the proximity of the deep-water measured mile at Skelmorlie. By 1913 Yarrow was ready to leave the business in the hands of the next generation and he retired to Hampshire until the outbreak of the First World War brought a swift return to work. In the ensuing conflict the shipyard built twenty-nine destroyers and Yarrow himself took responsibility for the development of shallow-draught gunboats for use in Mesopotamia. In 1916 he received a baronetcy for his war services. He was further honoured in 1922 when he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1924 when he received the honorary degree of LLD from Glasgow University. On 2 December 1922 he married his second wife, Eleanor Cecilia Barnes (1871/2&#150;1953), daughter of Goodwin Barnes, a coal proprietor.<br>
<br>A consummate businessman, and an enlightened and patriarchal employer, Yarrow was equally driven by the intellectual challenges which arose from his work. The problem of excessive vibration, caused by reciprocating ships' engines, was reduced by a method of balancing which became known&#151;using the names of those who had collaborated on it&#151;as the Yarrow&#150;Schlick&#150;Tweedy system. Yarrow was also interested in practices such as speed trials for ships and the use of new materials such as aluminium and mild steel which allowed the saving of weight in construction without the loss of strength. Another development was that of the hinged flap which, when placed across the propeller tunnel of shallow-draught vessels, closed the gap between the top of the tunnel and the water-line. This brought about a complete immersion of the propeller and generated greater power than would have been the case with a partial immersion.<br>
<br>A considerable benefactor, many of Yarrow's donations went to fund projects related to shipbuilding. He gave &pound;20,000 to build a test tank for ship models at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, which opened in 1911, while in 1923 he gave &pound;100,000 to the Royal Society to establish research professorships. He founded and endowed the Yarrow Home for Convalescent Children at Broadstairs, Kent, and gave generously to the London Hospital. &pound;24,000 went to the Nurses' Training Home at Govan, in Glasgow, and towards the provision of nurses in remote areas of Scotland. Other recipients of his giving included the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Institution of Naval Architects, and Girton College, Cambridge. Yarrow enjoyed a lively old age until his death at the Savoy Hotel, the Strand, London, on 24 January 1932; he was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Alfred Yarrow's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_51859"></a><span class="headword">Sir Harold Edgar Yarrow</span>, second baronet  (1884&#150;1962), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born on 11 August 1884 at Ardmore House, Blackheath Park, Charlton, London. He inherited his father's business acumen and man-management skills. After attending Bedford grammar school he underwent a training which included a spell at the rival French shipyard of Augustin-Normand. He then returned to Yarrow &amp; Co. Ltd at Poplar, London, and played a large part in the removal to Scotstoun, on the River Clyde. He was married twice. His first wife, whom he married on 27 February 1906, was Eleanor Etheldreda Aitken (1884/5&#150;1934), daughter of W. H. M. H. Aitken, canon of Norwich; they had one son and three daughters. On 6 February 1935 Sir Harold married Rosalynde Vere (<i>b</i>. 1896/7), daughter of the scientist Sir Oliver Joseph Lodge; they had a daughter.<br>
<br>Harold Yarrow served as chairman and managing director of Yarrows for forty years; his decision to diversify into land boiler production enabled the company to survive a period in the 1920s when naval contracts all but ceased. He also maintained the family's charitable tradition, being involved in the foundation of the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital at Erskine, Renfrewshire, for disabled former servicemen, a concern that followed naturally from the contribution that the shipyard had made in the production of artificial limbs during the First World War. He died on 19 April 1962 at Overton, Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire. Continuity was maintained both in business and charitable concerns by the succession of Sir Eric Grant Yarrow, third baronet (<i>b</i>. 1920), to the company chairmanship on his father's death. However, though Yarrows continued until 1990 to be the main shipyard for the construction of naval frigates, it had ceased to have a separate existence, having been taken over by the General Electric Company.<br>
