<span class="headword">Wade,  Joseph Augustine</span>  (1800/01&#150;1845), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Dublin. Earlier accounts usually gave his date of birth as about 1796, but the register of his death suggests that it was 1801. His father is said to have been a dairyman near Thomas Street, Dublin. He was a schoolfellow of Richard Robert Madden at Chaigneau's academy, Usher Street, Dublin, from about 1814 to 1816. Wade claimed to have been a student at Trinity College, Dublin, to have been a junior clerk in the Irish record office, and to have studied anatomy at the Irish College of Surgeons; but none of the records of these institutions bear any traces of his name, though in later years he may, with William Rooke, have found employment in the record office. Equal uncertainty surrounds his early musical education; he was probably self-taught. He left Dublin and about 1818 married a lady of fortune, a Miss Kelly of Garnaville, near Athlone, but he soon became tired of her. On his return to Dublin he is said to have acquired considerable skill as an anatomist and surgeon. Surgery was, however, soon abandoned, and Wade became a poet and musician, publishing, about 1818, <span class="italic">A Series of Select Airs</span>. Sir John Andrew Stevenson, recognizing his great gift of melody, advised Wade to apply for the university chair of music, dormant since 1774 after the resignation of Lord Mornington, but the matter fell through.<br>
<br>Wade migrated in 1821 to London, where he became conductor of the opera at the King's Theatre during Monck Mason's regime. His first significant success in London was his oratorio <span class="italic">The Prophecy</span>, from Pope's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>, which was produced at Covent Garden Theatre on 24 March 1824. His opera <span class="italic">The Two Houses of Granada</span>, of which he wrote both words and music, was first performed at Drury Lane on 31 October 1826, with John Braham as Don Carlos; two of its numbers, the duet &#145;I've wandered in dreams&#146; and the song &#145;Love was Once a Little Boy&#146;, became popular favourites. In 1826 Wade composed and published his most successful song, a setting of his own text &#145;Meet me by moonlight alone&#146;, which enjoyed extraordinary popularity. It had the good fortune to be further immortalized by the witty Father Prout in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> (October 1834, 480), in a French poem: &#145;Viens au bosquet, ce soir, sans t&eacute;moin, Dans le vallon, au clair de la lune&#146;. Two further operas, <span class="italic">The Convent Belles</span> (on which he collaborated with William Hawes), produced at the Adelphi on 8 July 1833, and <span class="italic">The Pupil of da Vinci</span>, given at St James's Theatre on 30 November 1839, made little impression.<br>
<br>A man of remarkable gifts and acquirements as a writer of lyrics, a composer, a violinist, and a journalist witty and quick in perception, Wade became increasingly indolent and self-indulgent. He drank to excess, and latterly became an opium addict. For the last few years of his life he was largely forgotten. He did some editorial work for the music publishers Chappell &amp; Co. at a salary of &pound;300 a year, and in that capacity, with William Crotch and George Alexander Macfarren, he harmonized some of the airs of W. Chappell's <span class="italic">Popular Music of the Olden Time</span>, originally published in 1838 as <span class="italic">A Collection of National English Airs</span>. From early 1829, for a while, he provided reviews of Italian opera in London for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, in which he showed his independence by chastising the other London critics for their disparagement of Rossini; he also contributed to <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, but he could never be relied upon. He compiled <span class="italic">The Handbook for the Pianoforte</span> (1844), which he dedicated to Liszt, and apparently left a history of music in manuscript. He died penniless, in a state of mental derangement, at his lodgings, 450 (or 340) Strand, on 15 July 1845. His first forename appears in the death registers at Somerset House as Joseph (not John, as he sometimes signed himself), and his surname as Ward. His first wife having died childless, Wade lived with another woman, and at his death a subscription was raised for his presumed widow and her two destitute children. Wade's character may be best summarized in the words of the Revd John Richardson:<blockquote>A wise man in theory and a fool in practice. A vigorous intellect; planning everything, performing nothing. Always in difficulties, having the means at hand to extricate himself from their annoyance, yet too apathetic to arouse himself to an effort; content to dream away his time in any occupation but that which the requisitions of the occasion demanded.</blockquote>
