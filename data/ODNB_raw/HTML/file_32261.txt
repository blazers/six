<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tanner]</span>,  Beatrice Stella</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Mrs Patrick Campbell]</span>  (1865&#150;1940), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 9 February 1865 in Forest House, Kensington, London, the sixth and youngest child of John Tanner (1831&#150;1893), the son of a wealthy army contractor to the British East India Company, and of his wife, Maria Luigia Giovanna Romanini (1835&#150;1908), daughter of Count Angelo Romanini, an Italian political exile. The young Stella was educated in Brighton, Hampstead, and Paris. Although she attended the Guildhall School of Music and won a scholarship, she did not keep up her studies. In 1884, pregnant with her first child, Beo, Stella eloped and was secretly married to the young Patrick Campbell (1864&#150;1900). In 1886 they had a second child, Stella, who also had a career on the stage (although much against the wishes of her mother). Given that the couple were in desperate financial straits, Patrick Campbell, known as Pat, sought employment overseas and left for Australia, subsequently moving on to South Africa, where he worked for mining companies. Although he stayed in contact with his wife and family, the money he was able to send home was not enough to support Stella and the two children. The experience of performing with the amateur Anomalies Dramatic Club gave Stella the idea of taking up acting professionally as a way of supporting herself and the two children.<br>
<br>Stella chose her husband's name for her stage name, and made her professional d&eacute;but as Mrs Patrick Campbell in 1888 at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, in R. Buchanan's and H. Vezin's <span class="italic">Bachelors</span>. Engagements with Millicent Bandmann-Palmer's company and with Ben Greet's Woodland Players (where her most successful role was as Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>) were to follow. In contrast to the open-air Shakespeare she played with Greet, Stella's early professional London work was in melodrama at the Adelphi, under the management of the Gattis, where she was contracted to play in R. Sims's and R. Buchanan's <span class="italic">The Trumpet Call</span>. It was while playing at the Adelphi in 1893 in Sims's and Buchanan's melodrama <span class="italic">The Black Domino</span>, that she was &#145;discovered&#146; by Florence Alexander and Graham Robertson as a possible contender for the title role in Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>. Pinero was making arrangements for the play's production at the St James's Theatre, managed by George Alexander, but was finding it difficult to cast an actress to play Paula Tanqueray, a woman with a past. When seen at the Adelphi, Stella was recovering from an almost fatal illness (typhoid fever), but her dark Italian looks, and her natural paleness and fragility heightened by the illness, were thought suited to the appearance of Paula: a woman who tries desperately, but hopelessly, to begin a new, respectable life. No sooner had Pinero agreed terms with Mrs Campbell, than the Gattis, who had been looking to release her, refused to let her go. The part was then given to Elizabeth Robins, who graciously backed down when the Gattis revised their decision, thereby allowing Mrs Campbell to accept the role which would bring her overnight fame.<br>
<br>Mrs Campbell's performance in <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>, which opened at the St James's Theatre on 27 May 1893, was arguably the highlight of her career. Reviewers compared her favourably to the star actresses: to Eleanora Duse (who had been playing in London shortly before <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>) and to Sarah Bernhardt. Typical of the lavish response to her performance was a comment from the reviewer for the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> that &#145;she showed a genius which gives her from this time forth an enviable place on the English stage&#146;  (29 May 1893, 3). Among the many commentators, Kate Terry Gielgud described Mrs Campbell as &#145;tall and slight and dark, not pretty but attractive, the type of face that excites curiosity: and she has nervous, characteristic hands. There is a tinge of commonness about her though, which helps the part to a certain extent&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Victorian Playgoer</span>, 1980, 10&#150;11). Solomon J. Solomon painted her in the role of Paula Tanqueray; Aubrey Beardsley captured her as Paula in a pencil portrait for the first volume of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. However, playing the role of a woman with a past also brought her notoriety. As Mrs Campbell comments in her autobiography &#145;many people held the attitude&#151;&#147;She could not play Mrs. Tanqueray as she does if she did not know something of that kind of life&#148;&#146;  (Campbell, 82).<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>, Mrs Campbell appeared as the barmaid Dulcie Larondie in Arthur Jones's <span class="italic">The Masqueraders</span> (1894)&#151;a part which she did not care for and in which she did not excel. The degree of her antipathy was evidenced by the way in which she surrendered the part to Evelyn Millard, some few months after the production opened. Nor did a further woman with a past role&#151;Kate Cloud in C. Haddon Chambers's <span class="italic">John-a-Dreams</span> (1894)&#151;repeat the success of her Paula Tanqueray. 1894 was a more significant year in terms of her personal rather than professional life: her husband returned from abroad, penniless and in poor health. Even if she had wanted to, Mrs Campbell was unable to give up her acting career with her two children and now a husband to support.<br>
<br>Mrs Campbell's next major success came in 1895 in another of Pinero's plays, <span class="italic">The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith</span>, in which she played Agnes Ebbsmith, a &#145;new woman&#146; with unconventional views on marriage. Although radical in terms of its anti-marriage views, the drama was ultimately conservative in its treatment of Agnes who repents of her radicalism and returns to religion. The play was &#145;notorious&#146; for its &#145;Bible burning&#146; scene of the close of act III, in which Agnes throws her <span class="roman">Bible</span> onto the fire and then, regretting her action, pulls it out of the flames. Although a supporter of the new drama&#151;Mrs Campbell appeared, for example, at the Avenue as the Ratwife in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Little Eyolf</span> (November 1896) in a series of matin&eacute;es organized by Elizabeth Robins, and outbid Janet Achurch to take the lead as Rita Allmers in a commercial production of the play the following month&#151;she needed commercial star vehicles, such as the eponymous heroine in V. Sardou's <span class="italic">F&eacute;dora</span> (made famous by Duse and Bernhardt), which she played at the Haymarket in May 1895.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1895 Mrs Campbell agreed generous terms with the actor&#150;manager Johnston Forbes-Robertson and played Juliet to his Romeo (Lyceum, September 1895) for which she received rather mixed reviews. Their partnership continued over the next five years (both on and off the stage), the two appearing opposite each other in plays such as Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e's <span class="italic">For the Crown</span> (<span class="italic">Pour la couronne</span>) (February 1896), and <span class="italic">Magda</span>, a translation of Herman Sudermann's <span class="italic">Heimat</span> (June 1896)&#151;a failure with both critics and audiences, and taken off in favour of R. B. Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, with Stella as Lady Teazle. She played Lady Hamilton to Forbes-Robertson's Nelson in R. Home's <span class="italic">Nelson's Enchantress</span> (February 1897), a success for her, but a failure for him. After a period of illness, Mrs Campbell returned to the stage to play Ophelia to Forbes-Robertson's Hamlet (September 1897). This time their fortunes were reversed: Forbes-Robertson was praised for his Hamlet, while Mrs Campbell was heavily criticized for her playing of Ophelia, whom she chose to interpret as genuinely mad. The pattern continued: Forbes-Robertson angered Mrs Campbell because of his reluctance to stage Maeterlinck's <span class="italic">Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</span> (June 1898), a production which delighted Mrs Campbell and the critics, while she was hostile to his choice of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1898), widely admonished as a failure. The two agreed to separate and in 1899 Mrs Campbell arranged to tour with her own company. They were reunited in September 1899 in Chester Baily Fernald's Japanese play, <span class="italic">The Moonlight Blossom</span>, but on rather different terms: this was Mrs Patrick's management venture, not Forbes-Robertson's. The production was neither a critical, nor a financial success, and the two severed their professional and personal lives completely. In April 1900 her husband was killed in fighting in South Africa during the South African War.<br>
<br>Mrs Campbell continued in management, but at a smaller theatre, the Royalty, where productions included Louis N. Parker's <span class="italic">The Sacrament of Judas</span>, <span class="italic">Mrs Jordan</span>, George Fleming's <span class="italic">The Fantasticks</span>, <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Daventry</span> (controversial because based on a scenario by Oscar Wilde), and revivals of <span class="italic">Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</span>, <span class="italic">The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith</span>, and <span class="italic">Magda</span>, which she played to much greater critical acclaim than in the original production. In 1901, in order to support her own extravagant lifestyle and family, Mrs Campbell undertook the first of several American tours, in between which she tried to find new plays to perform in England. During the first decade of the twentieth century, she appeared in the work of several internationally acclaimed playwrights, including Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson (<span class="italic">Beyond Human Power</span>, November 1901), Henrik Ibsen (<span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span>, March 1907), W. B. Yeats (<span class="italic">Deirdre</span>, November 1908), and Eug&egrave;ne Brieux (<span class="italic">False Gods</span>, <span class="italic">La foi</span>, September 1909). Yet she was more popular (and financially successful) in plays such as Sardou's <span class="italic">La sorci&egrave;re</span> (October 1904), or revivals of <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>.<br>
<br>One of Mrs Campbell's own passions was Maeterlinck's <span class="italic">Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</span>, and in 1904 she appeared in a revival of the play with Sarah Bernhardt playing in <i>travesti</i> as Pell&eacute;as. As Bernhardt did not speak English, Mrs Campbell played her M&eacute;lisande in French. For this production Mrs Campbell wore the shimmering gold dress&#151;nicknamed the &#145;gold umbrella case&#146;&#151;which she had worn in the original 1898 production and which had been designed by Edward Burne-Jones. Bernhardt, in tunic, chain mail, and tights, appeared as the young prince, although in reality she was a woman of sixty, while her princess was approaching forty. This caused one critic, Max Beerbohm, who had so admired Mrs Campbell's performance in the original production, to stay away  (Peters, 249&#150;50), and another, a Dublin critic, to complain during the subsequent 1905 tour of the production that the two actresses were old enough to know better  (Campbell, 139). Beerbohm's reluctance to see the two stars playing opposite each other deprived him of a performance which other critics responded to with enthusiasm.<br>
<br>On 6 April 1914 Mrs Campbell married again. Her second husband was the recently divorced George Cornwallis-West (1874&#150;1951), previously married to Jennie Churchill. They were married just days before Mrs Campbell opened in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> at His Majesty's, in which she played Eliza Doolittle to Herbert Beerbohm Tree's Professor Higgins. Mrs Campbell was hugely successful as Eliza: &#145;I invented a Cockney accent and created a human Eliza&#146;, she wrote later  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). She and Shaw had known each other well for some time and they kept up an enduring, although tempestuous relationship. She used his letters in an autobiography published in 1922; and a fuller volume of their correspondence was published in 1952 after Shaw's death. Mrs Campbell was less fortunate in her marriage, which lasted barely six years: Cornwallis-West deserted her in December 1919, leaving behind huge debts. During the 1920s she appeared far less on the London stage. Her roles included George Sand in Philip Moeller's <span class="italic">Madame Sand</span> (Duke of York's, June 1920), and appearances in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Ghosts</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">John Gabriel Borkman</span> (1928). In 1929 she appeared for the last time at the Royalty, the theatre which she had previously managed, in a production of G. B. Stern's <span class="italic">The Matriarch</span>. In the 1930s she continued to tour America and had a relatively uneventful career in Hollywood. The close of the decade found her in France, first staying in Paris, then travelling south to Pau where she died of bronchial and pulmonary infection on 9 April 1940 and was later buried.<br>
<br>During her lifetime critics were divided over how &#145;great&#146; an actress she was. For some she was the English Bernhardt, while others felt she did not take her art seriously enough. James Agate listed her as one of &#145;six great actresses, and six only&#146;, whom he saw during his lifetime: &#145;Bernhardt, R&eacute;jane, <i>Mrs</i>. Kendal, Ellen Terry, Duse and Mrs. Patrick Campbell&#146;  (Peters, 468). Modern theatre scholarship has focused on the significance of her career in relation to gender issues: on her work as an actress who was not afraid to play roles deemed socially unconventional or radical for their time, and as a woman who tried for an independent career as an actress&#150;manager.<br>
