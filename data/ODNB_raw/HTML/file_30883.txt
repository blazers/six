<span class="headword">Bustamante <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Clarke]</span>, Sir  (William) Alexander</span>  (1884&#150;1977), <span class="occ">prime minister of Jamaica</span>, was born William Alexander Clarke on 24 February 1884 at Blenheim, Hanover, Jamaica, the elder son and second of the five children of Robert Constantine Clarke, an Irish planter, of Hanover, and his second wife, Mary Wilson, a Jamaican. In later life he shrouded his upbringing in legend. He attended elementary school. In 1904 he was a store clerk, and went to Belmont, St Catherine, to train as an overseer. In 1905 he left for Cuba, where a tramway company employed him. They transferred him as inspector to Panama, where he courted Mildred Edith Blanck, the widow of an English engineer, who had two sons. In 1910 they married at Kingston, Jamaica. He thus had two stepsons, but no children of his own. He worked for the tramway company in Panama certainly until 1919, and reportedly joined the Cuban special police in 1919 or 1920. In 1932 he went to New York as Alejandro Bustamanti, a Spanish gentleman, apparently becoming a hospital attendant. He claimed he made his fortune on the New York stock exchange, but once said he left New York to avoid having to establish his legal status to the American immigration authorities.<br>
<br>In 1934, as Alexander Bustamante, he opened a moneylending office in Kingston, Jamaica. His secretary was Gladys Maud Longbridge JP, daughter of Frank Longbridge; he married her in 1962. He wrote anti-government letters to the press, sympathizing with the underprivileged. In 1937 he became treasurer of the Jamaica Workers' and Tradesmen's Union.<br>
<br>By May 1938 Bustamante was undisputed labour leader. He was arrested on 24 May on a sedition charge, which was later withdrawn. He was a key figure in the development between 1938 and 1943 of two rival trade union blocs and two political parties supported by trade union wings. He registered the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union in 1939, installing himself as life president-general. After a waterfront address he was interned on 8 September 1940, but released on 8 February 1942. The hierarchy of the People's National Party of Norman Manley looked after the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union, but on release Bustamante repudiated them. He left the People's National Party to form the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) in 1943. To avoid disqualification from nomination as a candidate under a name not legally his own, he became William Alexander Bustamante by deed poll. His party won the 1944 elections, and he became leader of government business and minister of communications from 1945 to 1953.<br>
<br>In 1947 Bustamante was elected mayor of Kingston. The JLP won the 1949 elections with a reduced majority. In 1951 its constitution stated the goals as self-government, British Caribbean federation, and dominion status within the Commonwealth. Bustamante, however, never supported federation strongly. He became chief minister and minister of local government in 1953, but after his party's defeat in 1955, led the opposition. He was president of the West Indies Democratic Labour Party from 1958 to 1960, but resigned to campaign for Jamaica's withdrawal from the federation. His opposition led to the 1961 referendum which decided on secession. The JLP won the 1962 elections. With independence in 1962 he became the first prime minister, keeping responsibility for external affairs and defence. He was sworn of the privy council in 1964. He retired in 1967, at the age of eighty-three.<br>
<br>Bustamante was a Roman Catholic with deep respect for the church's guidance. He was tall, striking, flamboyant, vigorous, and courageous. His recreations were farming, swimming, motoring, and, in youth, horse-breaking. He was a spellbinding, clowning demagogue with great authority over the masses. He was economically and politically conservative, and led a conservative labour-based party. He opposed socialism and upheld the traditional values of Jamaican society. In 1962 he told the house: &#145;I am for the West. I am against communism&#146;.<br>
<br>Bustamante had deep compassion for the working classes and strove to improve their economic lot. He said: &#145;I belong to no class. I belong to all classes. But I plead for the poor of the poor, for I come from the gutter of poverty and I once knew what hunger was and what nakedness was.&#146; He shared working-class affection for the British monarchy.<br>
<br>Bustamante was knighted in 1955, appointed GBE in 1967, and became a National Hero (Jamaica) in 1969. He was made an honorary doctor of laws of Fairfield University, A, in 1963 and of the University of the West Indies in 1966. He held the national order of cedars, Lebanon; the distinguished order of the brilliant star with special grand cordon, Republic of China; the grand gold cross, Order Gran Heraldica de Cristobal Colon, Dominican Republic; and the gran cordon, order of Liberatador, Venezuela. Bustamante died at his residence in Irish Town, Jamaica, on 6 August 1977.<br>
