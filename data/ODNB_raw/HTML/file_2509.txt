<span class="headword">Blackbourne,  John</span>  (1683&#150;1741), <span class="occ">bishop of the nonjuring Church of England</span>, was the son of Thomas Blackbourne. He was educated at a school in Audley, Cheshire, and from May 1697 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1701 and MA in 1705. His refusal to recognize the revolutionary settlement and to swear an oath of allegiance to William and Mary excluded him from clerical preferment.<br>
<br>Blackbourne then moved to Little Britain in the City of London, where,<blockquote>almost lost to the world and hid amongst old books &hellip; [he] lived a very exemplary, good life, and studied hard, endeavouring to be useful to mankind, both as a scholar and divine. To keep himself independent, he became corrector of the press to Mr. Bowyer, printer, and was, indeed, one of the most accurate of any that ever took upon him that laborious employ. (Nichols, 1.252&#150;3)</blockquote>In London he attracted a small religious community and regularly performed secret nonjuring services in an unofficial chapel at Gray's Inn. He was powerfully recommended to the exiled Stuart court in Rome by Lord Winchilsea, whose patronage was crucial for a number of nonjurors in London. In his presence, Blackbourne was consecrated as a nonjuring bishop on 6 May 1725 by the nonjuring prelates Nathaniel Spinckes and Henry Gandy, and later took part himself in the consecration of Richard Rawlinson on 25 March 1728.<br>
<br>In the 1720s Blackbourne became the leading figure among the group of nonjurors that, in respect to liturgical questions and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, adhered to the practice of the Restoration church. He exemplified these principles (in, for example, his refusal to use the mixed chalice) in the biographical account of his friend, <span class="italic">The Life of the R. Reverend Mr. Nathanael Spinckes</span> (1731). The group came to be known as the nonusagers, in contradistinction to the usagers, who emphasized the importance of tradition in doctrinal questions and wished to introduce chiefly into their eucharistic liturgy certain changes, based on their knowledge of the ancient church and the first <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> (1549). The two parties remained separate, each consecrating several bishops, from the year 1718 to 1732, when a reconciliation was attempted. Blackbourne, however, &#145;the most violent opponent of that scheme of conciliation&#146;  (Broxap, 226), still refused to relinquish the use of the communion office of the Anglican church. He lost more and more influence within the nonjuring sect, but continued to lead a small separate community, the extreme nonusagers, which ceased to exist with his death.<br>
<br>Apart from his press corrections for the leading London printer William Bowyer, Blackbourne also edited several religious books and published a four-volume edition of the works of Francis Bacon (1730), which apparently contributed to the fact that he was well off compared to other nonjurors, leaving several hundred pounds to his wife, Philadelphia (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;1751), and fellow brethren. He died in London on 17 November 1741, and was buried in Islington churchyard four days later. His library of about 1500 books was sold by auction in February 1743.<br>
