<span class="headword">Blount,  Thomas</span>  (1605/6&#150;1678), <span class="occ">landowner and local politician</span>, was the second son of the six sons and two daughters born to Edward Blount (1559&#150;1618), lawyer and landowner, and his second wife, Fortune, daughter of the London merchant Sir William Garway (Garraway). The Blount family held the manor and 280 acres of Wricklemarsh, near Charlton, Kent, and as his elder brother predeceased their father Thomas inherited Wricklemarsh. He matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 5 December 1623, aged seventeen; the following year he was admitted to Gray's Inn but did not proceed to the bar. By 1629 he was giving legal advice to the vestrymen of Greenwich. From 1636 until 1660 he was an active JP in his corner of north-west Kent and assiduously attended assizes up to the mid-1650s and rather more infrequently thereafter. On 4 February 1629 or 1630 at St Peter-le-Poer, London, he married Sarah, the daughter of Captain Anthony Wood of Rotherhithe, Surrey. They are known to have had four sons&#151;of whom the eldest was Thomas, (<i>b</i>. 1636/7)&#151;and three daughters. <br>
<br>Blount was present at the meetings at Maidstone of county gentry, including Sir Edward Dering and Sir Roger Twysden, which resulted in the getting up of the royalist Kentish petition at the assizes of March 1642; he reported the matter at the bar of the House of Commons and was an organizer of the pro-parliamentarian counter-petition. With the coming of war he was appointed colonel of a Kentish regiment, and he was one of two men excepted from the royal pardons offered to Kent in November and December 1642. He became a leading figure on the county committees, an ally of Sir Anthony Weldon in overriding local interests in the cause of parliament. Indeed, he was one of only eight men to sit on the chief committee continuously throughout the period 1643&#150;60 (out of a total of 274 who served on it at some point in those years), as the more established and politically moderate county leaders gave way to minor gentry more ruthless in doing parliament's bidding. Socially Blount&#151;a man of some substance but from a family only recently settled in the county&#151;was an intermediate figure between these two groups; politically his inclinations were very much with the latter. Sir Roger Twysden, who was at the receiving end of Blount's duties as a sequestration commissioner, remarked that he was &#145;a great stickler for the two houses of parliament&#146;  (&#145;Sir Roger Twysden's journal&#146;, 202n.). In January 1645 Blount shielded the Antinomian John Saltmarsh from a local crowd when he tried to preach at Westerham. In April that year he was active in suppressing a royalist rising in the county, when he &#145;caused to be beaten an alarm on the top of his own house, and summoned in the country all about&#146;  (Everitt, 216). A few months later he engineered a less serious combat: to appease the local population for the loss of their May day games he staged a mock battle on Blackheath, with two infantry regiments acting as cavaliers and roundheads. <br>
<br>In 1649 Blount was nominated to sit on the high court of justice to try Charles I, but he failed to attend any of its sessions. In 1652 he was a radical presence on the commission for law reform (the so-called Hale commission) set up by the Rump Parliament. The following year he was summoned to sit in Barebone's parliament, having been nominated by the gathered churches of Kent. There he showed &#145;mildly radical leanings in both &hellip; religion &hellip; and &hellip; politics&#146;  (Woolrych, 119). He sat on a dozen committees, including some which reflected his religious preoccupations (those for tithes and for the advancement of learning) and some his legal (for civil marriage, for abolishing the court of chancery, and for suppressing highwaymen). To judge by the divisions for which he served as teller, he shared the radical hostility to tithes and lay patronage. <br>
<br>In the early 1650s Blount extended his estate by the purchase of crown lands on the Isle of Sheppey and in Lewisham, Kidbrooke, and Charlton. In 1656 he transferred his interest in the Wricklemarsh property to his son Thomas, recently married to Anne Oldfield, although he continued to occupy the main house. In 1657 he provided both men and arms to suppress Thomas Venner's Fifth Monarchist rising and two years later opposed a royalist rising in Kent. At the Restoration he was removed from the bench and became an object of suspicion to the new regime. In 1661 he attended services at St Margaret, Lee, Kent, where the clergymen (both shortly to be ejected for their failure to conform) were more congenial to him than the incumbent who now presided at St Luke, Charlton. His action was reported by spies, and he was arrested, charged with sedition, and imprisoned for conspiracy. However, the testimony of friends and his own exculpatory statements secured his release after two months. He claimed that during the war he had refused a commission which was worded as coming from parliament alone rather than from king and parliament; he had treated kindly the duke of Richmond and other royal servants; and he had given the Greenwich bellringers 20<i>s</i>. to ring the peal celebrating the Restoration. The following year the former magistrate suffered the indignity of being himself the victim of highway robbery. <br>
<br>During the 1650s Blount was friendly with Robert Boyle and John Wilkins, two of the circle who later founded the Royal Society, to which Blount was elected in February 1665. His first encounter with John Evelyn was in 1652 when Evelyn had been robbed and tied up while on his way from Tunbridge Wells to London. On freeing himself, Evelyn went to the nearby Wricklemarsh House, from where Blount immediately sent out hue and cry to search for the robbers. They were not found, but the episode led to Evelyn and Blount becoming friends. In 1655 Evelyn was shown Blount's subterranean rabbit warren and drank the wine from his vineyard, which he noted in his diary as &#145;good for little&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.161); in 1656 Boyle and other virtuosi, having dined with Evelyn, called afterwards on Blount to see his new plough and in the following year he saw the odometer which Blount had affixed to his carriage, activated by the turning wheel, so as to count the miles travelled. In 1659 Evelyn met at Wricklemarsh <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2687/', "Sir Henry Blount (1602&#150;1682)")</script>, Blount's kinsman and Levant traveller. <br>
<br>Samuel Pepys was another acquaintance; on 1 May 1665 he met Lord Brouncker and others going to Blount's for dinner, and was persuaded to join them, finding Blount's house &#145;a very stately seat for its situation and brave plantations; and among others, a vineyard, the first that ever I did see&#146; (Pepys has forgotten his visit to the Hatfield House vineyard in 1661):<blockquote>after dinner to the tryall of some experiments about making of coaches easy. And several we tried, but one did prove mighty easy (not here for me to describe, but the whole body of that coach lays upon one long spring and we all, one after another, rid in it; and it is very fine and likely to take. (Pepys, 6.94)</blockquote>In September, &#145;after dinner comes Colonel Blount in his new chariott made with springs, as that was of wicker, wherein a while since we rode at his house&#146;. This held one passenger and the driver sat in a sprung saddle. Pepys tried it for comfort, &#145;and found it pretty well but not so easy as he pretends&#146;  (Pepys, 6.213). The following January Brouncker, Wilkins, Pepys, and Robert Hooke again met at Blount's to discuss coaches. This was one of a series of trials of new chariots, in competition with similar French designs. A report was made to the Royal Society on 14 March. <br>
<br>In November 1666 Blount presented the Royal Society with two sorts of English wine, new and old, some black salsify, which he said might be propagated in England much as parsnips, a type of pea, said to be extremely fertile, and some spirit of cherry wine, of singular strength. He withdrew from the society in 1668, perhaps offended by the society's declared preference in 1667 for William Croune's chariot, and died ten years later. He was buried at St Luke, Charlton, on 2 December 1678.<br>
