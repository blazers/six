<span class="headword">Ogle,  John William</span>  (1824&#150;1905), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Leeds, Yorkshire, on 30 July 1824, was the only child of Samuel Ogle (<i>b</i>. 1797), a businessman, and Sarah Rathmell. His father, who was first cousin to Admiral Thomas Ogle and second cousin to James Adey Ogle (1792&#150;1857), regius professor of medicine at Oxford, was a member of an old Staffordshire and Shropshire family which originally came from Northumberland. John was educated at Wakefield School, from which he moved in March 1844 to Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1847, and developed sympathy with the Tractarian movement. Ogle entered the medical school in Kinnerton Street attached to St George's Hospital, London, and became in 1850 a licentiate and in 1855 a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. At Oxford he proceeded MA and MB in 1851 and MD in 1857.<br>
<br>On 31 May 1854 Ogle married Elizabeth, daughter of Albert Smith of Ecclesall, near Sheffield, whose family subsequently took the name of Blakelock. They had five sons and one daughter. The eldest son, John, became a barrister. Another son, Cyril, became a physician at St George's Hospital, while a third entered the church.<br>
<br>At St George's Hospital, Ogle worked at morbid anatomy, and was for years curator of the museum, along with Henry Grey, after whose death in 1861 Ogle became lecturer on pathology. In 1857 he was elected assistant physician, and in 1866 he became full physician; however, he resigned in 1876 owing to depression. When he recovered from this, soon after overcoming an attack of enteric fever, he returned to active practice, but not to his work at St George's Hospital, where instead he became consulting physician in 1877. Ogle spent the whole of his professional life in London, also running a successful private practice there from premises in the fashionable and prosperous locations of Upper Brook Street and, subsequently, Cavendish Square.<br>
<br>Apart from his posts at St George's, Ogle held numerous hospital and other positions. He was censor (1873, 1874, and 1884) and vice-president (1886) of the Royal College of Physicians, associate fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, vice-president of the Pathological Society, vice-president and fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, corresponding member of the Edinburgh Medical and Chirurgical Society, corresponding member of the New York Society of Neurology and Electrology and of the New York Neurological Society, fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He was elected FSA on 7 March 1878. Ogle's hospital appointments included honorary posts at St James's Dispensary, St Leonard's Hospital, Sudbury, East Grinstead General Dispensary, Belgrave Hospital for Children, and the School for the Indigent Blind. In addition he was an examiner in medicine at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Ogle's main interest, though, lay in nervous diseases. In a lecture on aphasia, or inability to translate thoughts into words, he made some interesting historical references to the cases of Dr Johnson and Dean Swift. Always a strong churchman, he was on friendly terms with W. E. Gladstone, Cardinal Newman, who was a patient, Richard Church, Henry Liddon, Frederick Temple, and Edward Benson.<br>
<br>Ogle was active in medical literature, publishing several books including <span class="italic">On the Relief of Excessive and Dangerous Tympanites by Puncture of the Abdomen</span> (1888). But it was in the medical press that he made his greatest mark as a writer. Together with Timothy Holmes he founded the <span class="italic">St George's Hospital Reports</span> (1866&#150;79), and he edited seven out of the ten volumes. He was also editor of the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review</span>. He contributed very widely to medical periodicals and to the proceedings of learned societies, making 160 contributions to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Pathological Society of London</span> alone. He delivered the Royal College of Physicians' Croonian lectures in 1869 and its Harveian oration for 1880. The oration, which was published, including in summary form in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, contained a vigorous rebuttal of those critical of the state of medical education in Oxford University. This in turn elicited strong criticism in the form of an open letter signed by many distinguished figures including Joseph Lister.<br>
<br>After some years of increasing paralytic weakness, dating from 1899, Ogle died at St Michael's vicarage, Highgate, where he had been living for some time with his clergyman son, on 8 August 1905. He was buried later in the month at Shelfanger, near Diss in Norfolk.<br>
