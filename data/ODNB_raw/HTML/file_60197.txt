<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Ronald Crauford  Munro</span>, Viscount Novar  (1860&#150;1934), <span class="occ">politician and governor-general of Australia</span>, was born at Kirkcaldy on 6 March 1860, the eldest of the three sons and one daughter of Colonel Robert Ferguson (<i>d</i>. 1868), of Raith, Fife, and his wife, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of James Henry Mandeville, of Merton, Surrey. He was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9327/', "General Sir R. C. Ferguson")</script>. His father took the additional surname of Munro on the death of his first cousin Hugh Andrew Munro in 1864 when he inherited the estates of Novar, Ross-shire, and Muirton, Moray. He also had land in Fife. Ronald Munro Ferguson was educated at home and in 1875 joined the 1st Fife light horse, and in 1879, after attending Sandhurst, was gazetted to the Grenadier Guards, in which he served for five years until 1884. Intent from an early stage in a political career, in that year he was elected at a by-election as Liberal member for Ross and Cromarty, but was defeated at the general election of 1885 by a crofter candidate. In 1886, with the Liberal Party split over home rule, he was defeated in Dunbartonshire at the general election. However, on the intervention of Lord Rosebery, he was elected at a by-election for Leith burghs in July that year, Gladstone having surrendered the seat which he had won as well as Midlothian, in order to keep out the Liberal Unionist W. Jacks (who stood against Ferguson). He held the seat until he resigned in 1914. Despite saving the constituency for home rule, Ferguson was cautious about the policy. In the Commons he associated himself with R. B. Haldane (who was briefly engaged to his sister), Sir Edward Grey, and Asquith in the group which in due course became known as the Liberal Imperialists and which looked to Rosebery for leadership. Ferguson became the closest of the group to Rosebery. He accompanied him to India in 1886 and served as his private secretary during his foreign secretaryships in 1886 and in 1892&#150;4. During Rosebery's brief premiership, 1894&#150;5, which he had ardently promoted, Ferguson was a junior whip, with special responsibility for Scotland. In 1895 he declined the governorship of Victoria.<br>
<br>In 1889 Ferguson had married Lady Helen Hermione [<a name="cosubject_60197"></a><span class="headword">Helen Hermione Ferguson</span>  (1863&#150;1941)<span class="occ"></span>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31914/', "Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, first marquess of Dufferin and Ava")</script>, and his wife, Hariot Georgina. They had no children. The Fergusons, despite Lady Helen's origins, were hard up, and could not keep a carriage when in London. Ronald Ferguson found politics frustrating; though Rosebery's most intimate colleague and go-between, he was ineffective at liaising with Rosebery's Liberal opponents, and Haldane increasingly found himself taking over from Ferguson in this role. In the long Liberal opposition from 1895 until 1905 Ferguson took a prominent and sometimes belligerent part on the imperial side in the internecine struggles within the Liberal Party, and on the Liberals' return to office in December 1905, Campbell-Bannerman did not offer him office. He sought an imperial career, asking for the governorship of Bombay, but his lot was to be provost of Kirkcaldy (1906&#150;14). His national political career seemed over, especially as Rosebery's political behaviour became increasingly eccentric. His privy councillorship in 1910 must have seemed an inadequate sop, and he declined the offer of a peerage. He maintained a strong interest in military matters and assisted Haldane in the implementation of his army reforms.<br>
<br>In February 1914, however, Asquith, whose constituency comprised some of Ferguson's estates, appointed him governor-general of Australia. The choice was criticized by Australians who thought Asquith was unloading a failed politician, but Ferguson &#145;soon proved himself one of the ablest of the early governors-general&#146;  (<span class="italic">AusDB</span>). Given Ferguson's short temper and his wife's awareness of her aristocratic origins, it was a risky appointment, but it paid off. He arrived in Australia in May 1914, and was at once faced with a request for a double dissolution which, after taking a variety of advice, he granted. Australia's entry into the war was to Ferguson's personal advantage, for it offered a context which played to his strengths, and to those of his wife, who was made GBE in 1918 for her work as founder and director of the Red Cross in Australia. His tendency to seem abrasive now seemed patriotic, as he urged action. He vigorously promoted the war effort and vociferously complained to Whitehall when he thought Australia was being short-changed. On the other hand he was careful, especially in his dealings with Andrew Fisher and later William Morris Hughes, not to allow the governor-general's powers to be eroded by the need for rapid wartime decisions. Ferguson strongly supported conscription and Hughes's efforts to get it accepted. But when Hughes could not deliver conscription, Ferguson was within a whisker of dismissing him. In April 1918 he held an all-party conference at Government House, which however failed to resolve the matter. Ferguson was annoyed by the right granted to Hughes to represent Australia directly to Lloyd George at the Imperial War Conference in 1918, seeing this as a threat to his own office. He was persuaded to remain in post until 1920, partly to oversee the visit of the prince of Wales. He was active in environmental issues, and especially in promoting the good management and preservation of Australian forests. On his return to Scotland he was created Viscount Novar.<br>
<br>In 1922 Novar began the official career in Britain to which he had aspired since the 1880s, becoming vice-president of the education committee in 1922 and being made secretary of state for Scotland by Bonar Law in October 1922. He received the freedom of the city of Edinburgh in 1923. He was the only member of cabinet wholeheartedly to support Bonar Law over the row over the American debt, which led to Law's attempted resignation. When Baldwin succeeded Law as prime minister in November 1924, he did not include Novar in his government. In 1925 Novar chaired the committee on political honours and was a member of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. He was a trustee of the National Library of Scotland and was appointed KT in 1926. He died at Raith, Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 30 March 1934, and was cremated in Edinburgh on 4 April.<br>
