<span class="headword">Taylor,  George Francis</span>  (1903&#150;1979), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and banker</span>, was born on 13 January 1903 in Windsor, Melbourne, Australia, the son of George Arthur Taylor, a merchant, and his wife, Annie Mary Ryan, both of whom hailed from Melbourne. Taylor attended Xavier College, Melbourne (1917&#150;21), where he was &#145;dux of school&#146; in his final year and excelled in debating. He read history, philosophy, and law at the University of Melbourne, taking a BA, an MA, and an LLB between 1925 and 1928. He continued to win prizes for debating and took up student journalism. By the time he left university Taylor's interest had shifted from law to international relations, and he aspired to a career in journalism. He wrote occasionally on foreign affairs for the Melbourne press between 1927 and 1929, but freelance journalism did not pay, and in 1930 he joined Shell Oil.<br>
<br>Both the oil business and his ambition to write a book on British foreign policy brought Taylor to London in the mid-1930s. He married Vivian Judith Elizabeth Rose Price (<i>b</i>. 1915), the daughter of Vivian Franklin Lyon Rose Price, a Royal Navy officer, on 17 June 1937; they had three children. In March 1939 Taylor wrote to Rex Leeper, head of the Foreign Office news department, offering his services in the event of war. Later in the spring he was introduced by the mining magnate Chester Beatty to Colonel Laurence Grand, the founder of section D (for &#145;destruction&#146;) of the Secret Intelligence Service. Grand hired Taylor in July and made him head of D's Balkan network.<br>
<br>Section D, the principal predecessor of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), had been established in 1938 to investigate &#145;every possibility of attacking potential enemies by means other than the operations of military forces&#146;  (SOE headquarters file 63). This meant sabotage and subversion, and south-east Europe was a prime target because of the importance then attached to interdicting the flow of Romanian oil to Germany. Taylor's contribution, however, lay as much in defining section D's (and later SOE's) strategy and tactics as it did in conducting operations from London or in the field. Before the fall of France, Taylor pressed for continuous, widespread, but small-scale sabotage of communications by local patriots under British direction. After June 1940 he was an architect of the &#145;secret army&#146; strategy which led to the formation of SOE in July, and by which it was imagined that Britain might yet win the war through fomenting massive and co-ordinated uprisings by the peoples of occupied Europe when strategic bombing and blockade had prepared the way. This hope held sway until first Russia, and then America, entered the war.<br>
<br>Hugh Dalton, the minister in charge of SOE, dismissed Grand but embraced both his ethos and his deputy. Taylor became chief of staff to Sir Frank Nelson, the first executive head (known as CD) of SOE, in the autumn. Having discovered that the only functional asset inherited by SOE from section D was Taylor's Balkan organization, Nelson and Dalton sent him to the region in January 1941 to take charge of preparations for countering the expected German offensive. According to Taylor, Churchill had told Dalton in December that the Balkan situation &#145;was the acid test for SOE&#146;  (Stafford, 52&#150;3), which must make good its claim to represent a vital new instrument of warfare. After conferring at general headquarters in Cairo about help for the Greeks, Taylor set up shop in Belgrade, for without Yugoslav co-belligerency the defence of Greece would be hopeless. SOE agents worked both to stir up popular opposition to accession to the axis pact and to organize the overthrow of the government if it did accede. The Yugoslav government succumbed to German pressure on 25 March, but was toppled by a military coup two days later. Although SOE's links had been with the cheerleaders rather than the ringleaders of this putsch, its success redounded to SOE's credit. The acid test had been passed, notwithstanding the failure of the Balkan campaign which followed.<br>
<br>Taylor returned to London as Nelson's chief of staff after two months' internment in Italy with most of Britain's Belgrade-based diplomats and agents. In March 1942 he was appointed director of overseas groups and missions. Although never relegated from SOE's first division, Taylor's status waned after Nelson's retirement in May 1942 and his replacement by Sir Charles Hambro. Embarrassment over a concordat on operational spheres which he negotiated in Washington in the summer of 1942 with SOE's American clone and rival, the office of strategic services, but which his headquarters repudiated in favour of a better deal struck in London, was followed in early 1943 by implication in a botched operation to seize axis ships in the harbour of the Portuguese colony of Goa which the Foreign Office had forbidden. Taylor returned as Hambro's chief of staff in mid-1943, but it was to professional soldiers rather than to civilians that the top jobs now went. Taylor served out the war as director of SOE's Far East group, enjoying the rank of local brigadier on his far-flung travels and being appointed (civil) CBE in 1943.<br>
<br>Taylor was a short, dark man with sharp features and methodical habits. Julian Amery recalled how Taylor ordered identical meals when they dined together on three successive evenings at the same restaurant in the autumn of 1940. Asked why, Taylor explained that he always ate the same dishes until he grew bored with them, at which point he would choose something else from the menu for the same treatment  (Amery, 211&#150;12). Taylor was invariably described by both admirers and detractors as utterly ruthless. His friends added &#145;but brilliant&#146;. He wrote vastly long memoranda and signals which brooked no opposition. The last CD under whom he served, Major-General Colin Gubbins, described him as &#145;a very able, quick-thinking officer, of great energy and persistence, who at times presses his points too hard&#146;  (SOE personal file of G. F. Taylor).<br>
<br>Taylor joined the Bank of London and South America after the war, becoming a director in 1950, deputy chairman in 1966, and transitional chairman in 1970&#150;71. He implemented the previously agreed merger with Lloyds Bank Europe and the formation of what was to be known (albeit briefly) as Lloyds and BOLSA International Bank. He returned with his wife to Australia in 1975 and they settled in Perth, where he died of heart failure at Shenton Park on 17 January 1979 and was buried two days later in Karrakatta Roman Catholic Lawn cemetery, Perth.<br>
