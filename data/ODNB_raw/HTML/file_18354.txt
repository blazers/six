<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maty,  Paul Henry</span>  (1744&#150;1787), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born in London on 18 December 1744 and baptized on 18 January 1745 at St Anne's, Soho, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18353/', "Matthew Maty (1718&#150;1776)")</script>, librarian, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1750), daughter of Louis Chevalleau of Sieur de Boisragon. He was admitted a king's scholar at St Peter's College, Westminster, in 1758 before being elected in 1763 to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a scholar in 1764 and graduated BA in 1767 and MA in 1770. In 1768 he was nominated to one of the travelling fellowships of his college and spent three years abroad. In 1774 he was appointed chaplain to David Murray, Lord Stormont (afterwards second earl of Mansfield), British ambassador at the court of France. He vacated his fellowship in 1775 on his marriage to Harriet, daughter of Joseph Clerke of Wethersfield, Essex, and sister of Captain Charles Clerke, the successor to Captain Cook.<br>
<br>In 1776 doubts conceived as to the consistency of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, especially on such points as predestination and original sin, compelled Maty to refrain from seeking any further ecclesiastical appointment; his scruples, which approached Arianism, were printed in full in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for October 1777. Fortunately for him, however, on his father's death in July 1776 he obtained the situation of an assistant librarian in the British Museum, and in 1782 was promoted to under-librarian in the department of natural history and antiquities. He also succeeded in 1776 to the foreign secretaryship of the Royal Society, of which he had been elected a member on 13 February 1772, and on 30 November 1778, on the withdrawal of Dr Horsley, he became principal secretary. In this capacity he became involved in the controversy which raged about the virtual dismissal of Dr Charles Hutton from the post of foreign secretary by the president, Sir Joseph Banks. In a heated pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An history of the instances of exclusion from the Royal Society &hellip; with strictures on the formation of the council and other instances of the despotism of Sir Joseph Banks, the present president</span> (1784), he proposed that, as a means of protest against the president, the dissatisfied minority should form themselves into a solid phalanx, and resolutely oppose any admission whatsoever into the society, a proposal from which all moderate supporters of Maty's views dissented. Having tried in vain to organize a regular opposition under Horsley, Maty resigned his office on 25 March 1784, and his resignation helped to restore peace to the society. As secretary and an officer of the society he had not been expected to take any active part in the debate but here, as elsewhere, &#145;his vivacity outran his judgment&#146;. The loss of his office involved a reduction of income which he could not afford, and he was only moderately successful in making up the difference by giving instruction in classical and modern languages.<br>
<br>In January 1782 Maty had started the <span class="italic">New Review</span>, which aimed at giving a bird's-eye view of foreign publications, and he continued this considerable work, almost unassisted, until September 1786. Edward Gibbon referred to him as the &#145;angry son&#146; who wielded the rod of criticism with but little of &#145;the tenderness and reluctance&#146; of his father. Horace Walpole spoke of some of his comments as &#145;pert and foolish&#146;  (cf. <span class="italic">Canons of Criticism Extracted from the Beauties of Maty's Review</span>).<br>
<br>Three works by Maty appeared in 1787: <span class="italic">A General Index to the Philosophical Transactions, vols. i&#150;lxx</span>, which he had prepared some time previously; a translation of the work by Riesbeck as <span class="italic">Travels through Germany, in a Series of Letters</span> (3 vols.); and a French translation of the text to the first volume of <span class="italic">Gemmae Marlburienses</span>, to accompany the Latin of James Bryant. A volume of sermons delivered in the Ambassador's Chapel at Paris during the years 1774, 1775, and 1776, in which some of Secker's sermons were inadvertently included, was published in 1788. Bishop Horsley, Dean Layard, and Dr Southgate were responsible for the editing.<br>
<br>Maty died of asthma on 16 January 1787 and was buried in Bunhill Fields, London. His wife and only son were left in poor circumstances. Charles Burney undertook the expense of educating Maty's son, but he died while at school.<br>
