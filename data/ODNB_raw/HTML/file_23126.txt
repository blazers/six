<span class="headword">Rands,  William Brighty</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Henry Holbeach, Matthew Browne]</span>  (1823&#150;1882), <span class="occ">parliamentary reporter and writer</span>, was born on 24 December 1823 in Keppel Street, Chelsea, London, the son of a small shopkeeper, George Rands. He received a very limited education, and derived much of what he knew from reading at secondhand bookstalls. He had a varied career, worked for some years in a warehouse, went on the stage, and then became a clerk in an attorney's office. Having taught himself stenography, in May 1857 he entered the employment of Messrs Gurney, and was soon appointed a reporter in the committee rooms of the House of Commons. He proved very efficient, and after attending, during a session of the house, a committee on the merits of the Armstrong and Whitworth ordnance, he received a vote of thanks from the committee. Ill health compelled his resignation in August 1875.<br>
<br>When parliament was not sitting, Rands spent his time in literary work by special arrangement with his employers. At an early period he became a member of the staff of the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>, and he also contributed to many other journals, such as <span class="italic">St. Pauls Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Good Words for the Young</span>. In 1867, under the name Henry Holbeach, he contributed a tale entitled &#145;Shoemaker's Village&#146; to <span class="italic">The Argosy</span>. He wrote many articles for the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, contributed to the <span class="italic">Saturday Journal</span>, and also wrote for <span class="italic">Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. He was a reviewer for the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and also wrote for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. In 1878 he helped to found <span class="italic">The Citizen</span> newspaper in the City of London.<br>
<br>Rands was in many ways an eccentric character, and his domestic life was apparently somewhat irregular. On 5 October 1846, he had married Mary Ditton (<i>d</i>. 1881), the daughter of Benjamin Ditton, a cheesemonger, at the parish church of St Mary Lambeth, and they had three children. But after some years, Rands left his wife to live with Hannah Rolls (<i>b</i>. 1831/2), the daughter of John Rolls, a member of the Curriers' Company and of the court of aldermen of the City of London. Rands and Hannah had four children, and after the death of his first wife he married Hannah on 25 March 1881 at Camberwell register office. Rands was also for some time a preacher at a chapel in Brixton, and composed hymns, one of which, beginning &#145;One Lord there is all lords above&#146;, achieved considerable popularity in the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Rands was in fact a considerable all-round man of letters, poet, writer of fiction, literary critic, essayist, and children's writer. His adult poetry, such as <span class="italic">The Chain of Lilies</span> (1857), is typically Victorian sub-Tennysonian. The Christmas tale <span class="italic">The Frost upon the Pane</span> (1854) is almost equally sub-Dickensian, although his story of simple village folk is not without its own charm. His literary criticism is rather more robust. As well as essays on such American writers as Hawthorne and Poe, Rands produced a sketch of the life and writings of Robert Bloomfield in 1855, and in 1869 as Matthew Browne published a two-volume study, <span class="italic">Chaucer's England</span>, in which he reveals himself as an enthusiastic and informed advocate of the medieval poet. His essays on miscellaneous subjects, for example, in <span class="italic">Henry Holbeach: Student in Life and Philosophy</span> (1865), also retain some vitality in their lively, quirky opinions.<br>
<br>But it is as a children's writer that Rands is most likely to be remembered, principally for three books: <span class="italic">Lilliput Levee</span> (1864, 1867), <span class="italic">Lilliput Lectures</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">Lilliput Legends</span> (1872). <span class="italic">Lilliput Levee</span> contains some delightful verse, from the opening poem, in which children take over control of the world from adults, to such near-classics as &#145;Topsyturvey-world&#146; and &#145;The Dream of a Girl who Lived at Seven-Oaks&#146;. <span class="italic">Lilliput Lectures</span> combines talks for children on such topics as &#145;The world&#146; and &#145;The family&#146; with such poems as &#145;Great, Wide, Beautiful, Wonderful World&#146;. But <span class="italic">Lilliput Legends</span> is all stories, sometimes fables or fairy-tales like &#145;Prince Hydrangea&#146;, which mix fantasy and realism in ways that remind one of George MacDonald. William Brighty Rands is a writer who often memorably catches the mind, the voice, and the imagination of the child. Rands died on 23 April 1882, at his home, Luton Villa, 67 Ondine Road, East Dulwich, London, and was buried in the Forest Hill cemetery.<br>
