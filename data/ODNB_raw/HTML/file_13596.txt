<span class="headword">Holmes, Sir  John</span>  (1639/40&#150;1683), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Henry Holmes of Mallow, co. Cork, and a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13600/', "Admiral Sir Robert Holmes")</script>. The reference to him as a &#145;land officer&#146; in the duke of Albemarle's letter-book for 1665  (NMM, LBK-47) suggests that, like Robert, he probably served as a mercenary in the late 1650s. In 1664 he was lieutenant to his brother in the <i>Jersey</i>, taking part in her expedition to Guinea, and he served as lieutenant of the <i>Centurion</i> in the 1665 campaign, including at the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June. In September 1665 he was made captain of the <i>St Paul</i>, commanding her at the Four Days' Fight on 1&#150;4 June 1666; Holmes was wounded and the ship disabled and subsequently burnt by her own side in that action. He moved shortly afterwards to the <i>Bristol</i>, serving under his brother in the St James's day fight on 25 July, and again served under Sir Robert in the raid on the Dutch shipping in the Vlie in August. He remained in command of the <i>Bristol</i> until October 1667; an elevation to the second-rate <i>Triumph</i>, referred to in several accounts, was in fact only a temporary command for three days at the tail end of the Four Days' Fight. He briefly commanded the <i>Falcon</i> and <i>Kent</i> in 1668, and in 1669&#150;72 he commanded successively the <i>Nonsuch</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, and <i>Diamond</i> in the Mediterranean Fleet, engaged in the war against the Algerine corsairs. In January 1672 he took command of the <i>Gloucester</i>, one of the ships which took part in his brother's attack on the Dutch Smyrna convoy, and was badly wounded by a shot in the chest, although his ship successfully took the <i>Klein Hollandia</i>, killing the Dutch flag officer Aert van Nes. His reward for this service was a knighthood and command of the <i>Rupert</i>, in which he served in all the major engagements of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. On 14 August 1673, thanks largely to the patronage of Prince Rupert, he became rear-admiral of the blue, flying his flag in the <i>Royal Charles</i>, and remained aboard her until October.<br>
<br>Following the end of the war Holmes exploited his brother's governorship of the Isle of Wight by obtaining the reversion of that office in December 1675, purchasing the governorship of Hurst Castle for &pound;500, serving as mayor of Yarmouth in 1678&#150;9, and becoming MP for Newtown (Isle of Wight) in his brother's interest, first at a distinctly dubious by-election in 1677 and then in the elections for the three Exclusion Parliaments. Regarded at the time as a strong supporter of the court, although both he and Sir Robert went into opposition in the final session of the Cavalier Parliament, he was denounced by his political opponents as a syphilitic coward who had won his seat on the vote of one burgess, cast in the middle of the night. He returned to sea as commander-in-chief in the Downs, flying the union flag at the main in the <i>Mountague</i>, from April 1677 to May 1678, and escorted William of Orange on his return to Holland after his marriage to Princess Mary. He became rear-admiral of the fleet sent out in the French war scare of 1678, flying his flag in the <i>Charles</i>. His final seagoing command was that of the <i>Captain</i>, again as commander-in-chief in the Downs, from September 1678 to September 1679. In June 1679 he fought a duel with his fellow MP for Newtown, John Churchill, later duke of Marlborough, over Holmes relating to the king a story about Churchill &#145;beating an orange wench&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 473); Holmes successfully disarmed the future victor of Blenheim.<br>
<br>Holmes married Margaret (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1648, <i>d</i>. after 1692), daughter of Alderman Robert Lowther, draper of London, in April 1668. Pepys noted that the marriage was:<blockquote>by stealth; which I was sorry for, he being an idle rascal and proud, and worth little I doubt, and she a mighty pretty, well-disposed lady, and good fortune &hellip; but the sport is, Sir Rob. Holmes doth seem to be mad too with his brother and will disinherit him, saying he hath ruined himself, marrying below himself and to his disadvantage. (Pepys, 9.157)</blockquote>In the event, however, Sir Robert ultimately became guardian of Sir John's six children, and in his will bequeathed annuities to the three survivors, Robert, John, and Elizabeth, and to their widowed mother. Sir John Holmes died at his brother's house near the Horse Guards in London on 28 May 1683 and was buried on 23 June at Yarmouth church.<br>
