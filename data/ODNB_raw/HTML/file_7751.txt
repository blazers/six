<span class="headword">Dodington,  Bartholomew</span>  (1535/6&#150;1595), <span class="occ">Greek scholar</span>, was born in Middlesex of unknown parentage. He was admitted a scholar at St John's College, Cambridge, on the Lady Margaret Beaufort foundation on 11 November 1547 and proceeded BA in 1551&#150;2. In 1552 he was admitted a fellow of the college, on the same foundation, and in 1555 proceeded MA and signed the Marian articles imposed on the university. He was senior proctor from 1559 to 1560 and was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, at about the time he left office. In 1561 he unsuccessfully solicited the interest of Sir William Cecil, principal secretary, for the vacant oratorship at Cambridge, but was in the following year elected regius professor of Greek.<br>
<br>As a Johnian and a regius professor Dodington was well placed to attract the friendship of Cecil, himself a Johnian and one-time brother-in-law of Sir John Cheke, regius professor of Greek from 1540 to 1547, and surviving correspondence demonstrates that this was the case. His nephew leased a house in Westminster from Cecil, and it is likely that it was in this house that Dodington spent his last years. That he was a conscientious professor is witnessed by a copy of Hermogenes' <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span>, interleaved and copiously annotated by him, apparently as a source of lectures, with references to Demosthenes, Dionysius Halicarnassus, Isocrates, Iamblichus, Plato's <span class="italic">Gorgias</span>, Lysias, and, of course, Aristotle. On Elizabeth I's visit to Cambridge in 1564 Dodington made Greek and Latin orations before her and before Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and his Greek contribution to the verses presented to her by the university opened the volume with thirty-three lines of Greek hexameters in his own hand&#151;fittingly, both because of his status as regius professor and fellow of Trinity and because his calligraphy in Latin and Greek has long been recognized as the finest example of Cambridge humanist italic.<br>
<br>In 1571 Dodington published an edition of the translation of Demosthenes by his predecessor in the regius chair, Nicholas Carr, prefaced by not only Greek verses but also a sensitive and revealing life of Carr. In later years he contributed verses to Edward Grant's <span class="italic">Graecae linguae spicilegium</span> (1575), William Whitaker's translation of John Jewel's reply to Thomas Harding (1578), Peter Baro's <span class="italic">Praelectiones in Jonam</span> (1579), Everard Digby's <span class="italic">Theoria analytica</span> (1579), Edward Grant's edition of Crispinus's <span class="italic">Lexicon</span> (1581), and William Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1586), as well as verses on the death of Cecil's daughter, Anne de Vere, countess of Oxford, in 1588. Dodington's friendship with Baro, a fellow Calvinist, is attested to by his having acted as godson to Baro's son, Andrew, in 1574, and he was one of those who signed the petitions in favour of Thomas Cartwright in 1570. From Westminster in 1581 he wrote for John Whitgift, bishop of Worcester, a learned disquisition in connection with some matter of controversy on the distinction between the terms &#145;eidolon&#146; and &#145;simulachrum&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1585 Dodington resigned from his chair, but was allowed to retain the emoluments of his fellowship. He never married. He died on 22 August 1595 aged fifty-nine and was buried in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. His arms were: sable, three bugle horns azure, stringed gules.<br>
