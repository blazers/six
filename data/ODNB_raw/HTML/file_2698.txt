<span class="headword">Blount, Sir  Thomas Pope</span>, first baronet  (1649&#150;1697), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born on 12 September 1649 at Upper Holloway, Middlesex, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2687/', "Sir Henry Blount (1602&#150;1682)")</script>, traveller, and his wife, Hester (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1678), first daughter and coheir of Christopher Wase of Upper Holloway and widow of Sir William Mainwaring of Chester. The Hertfordshire Blounts have been linked to the distinguished medieval Staffordshire family, but their connection to the county can be taken back no further than the early Tudor period. It was from Sir Thomas Pope (1507?&#150;1559), the founder of Trinity College, Oxford, who had an acquisitive hand in the suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII, that the family inherited the manor of Tittenhanger, the former residence of the abbots of St Albans. This house Sir Henry entirely rebuilt, probably but not certainly in the final years of the Commonwealth. Blount was educated under his father's supervision, and acquired a reputation as a learned and accomplished young man, but did not go to university. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 1 December 1668.<br>
<br>On 22 July 1669, at St Olave's, Hart Street, London, Blount married Jane Caesar (1650&#150;1726), only daughter of Sir Henry Caesar, of Benington Place, Hertfordshire, and Elizabeth Angel. They had five sons and nine daughters. In 1678, on his mother's death, and within his father's lifetime, he succeeded to the seat at Tittenhanger, Sir Henry having settled the manor on his wife four years earlier. Blount succeeded to the remainder of the family's estates, in Hertfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex, on his father's death in October 1682. He was created a baronet by letters patent on 27 January 1680. For this dignity he was belatedly compelled to pay; although he disputed the debt, judgment went against him, and on 2 June 1686 he paid the exchequer &pound;1095.<br>
<br>A loyal whig (like his father and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2684/', "Charles Blount")</script> he was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>), he was returned to the House of Commons as member for St Albans for three parliaments between 1679 and 1681, and subsequently for one of the two Hertfordshire county seats for three further parliaments from 1689 until his death. His political career began quietly. &#145;Totally inactive in committee in 1679, he spoke only to explain how he had come to deliver to the Speaker a letter from a madman, which seemed designed to interrupt the business of the House&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 1.669&#150;70). He held a number of local offices, however (commissioner for assessment for Hertfordshire, 1673&#150;80, for St Albans, 1679&#150;80, 1689, and for Hertfordshire and Middlesex, 1689&#150;90, deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire, 1687&#150;97, and justice of the peace for the same county, 1690&#150;96), before being appointed in 1694, and then reappointed until his death, one of the commissioners for public accounts.<br>
<br>Blount's literary activities appeared in print in the final decade of the century. His first publication was <span class="italic">Censura celebriorum authorum</span> (1690), a volume, he explains in the preface, he had originally compiled for his own use and which he published only &#145;at the request of persons of distinguished learning&#146;, and with the hope that it &#145;might promote letters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 2.833, where a translation is provided). The work, a handsomely printed folio, is a biographical and bibliographical dictionary of the most eminent literary and scientific writers, collated from the opinions of fellow writers and reproduced in the several languages of those sources. The entries are arranged chronologically. They begin with Hermes Trismegistus, the writer &#145;thought to have been co&aelig;val with Moses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 2.833), and conclude with contemporaries of Thomas Hobbes, including in well over 500 entries many historians, physicians, philosophers, astronomers and mathematicians, theologians and churchmen, as well as smaller numbers of, for instance, geographers, printers, and antiquaries. Poets are also well represented, but Blount omits most modern English writers (Chaucer is included, Shakespeare is not), as well as later scientists of all lands. Subsequent editions were published in Geneva: a second in 1694, in which, for the sake of a uniform text, all the passages in modern languages were translated by the anonymous editor into Latin, and a third in 1696. Subsequent works adapt this model.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A Natural History</span> (1693) Blount collected observations from &#145;the Best Modern Writers&#146; (title-page) on various phenomena (amber, coral, tea and coffee, silver, diamonds, glow-worms, spiders, volcanoes, and the like), and in <span class="italic">De re poetica</span> (1694) he offered a compendium of literary thought &#145;Extracted out of the Best and Choicest Criticks&#146; (title-page) on poetry in general, on the different genres, and on poetry in Italian, Spanish, and French, to which he appended &#145;Characters and Censures&#146;, a biographical and critical account of sixty-seven writers, ancient and modern, including those English poets (Donne, Jonson, Milton, and Spenser, for example) not included in the <span class="italic">Censura</span>. His only original work was a collection of <span class="italic">Essays on Several Subjects</span> (1691; 2nd edn, 1692), &#145;writ in my idle hours, for my own Entertainment&#146;  (1691, sig. A2<i>v</i>). In seven short pieces, he treats of self-interest; the mischiefs of learning; education and custom; a tempered respect for antiquity; the virtues of modern men; passion; and the uncertainty of human knowledge. An eighth essay, added to a third, expanded edition (1697), concerns religion. In domestic metaphors and plain prose, Blount reveals himself to be sceptical, cynical, cheerfully optimistic, possessed of a dry wit, and warmly anti-Catholic. &#145;To infer the truth of a Religion, from the Number of its Professors&#146;, he comments on a characteristic concern, characteristically expressed, &#145;is falsely to conclude the fineness of the Cloth from the largeness of the Measure&#146;  (1697, 140).<br>
<br>Blount was well regarded in his lifetime as a cultivated and retiring man. He died of apoplexy at Tittenhanger on 30 June 1697, and was buried in the family vault at Ridge, Hertfordshire, on 8 July 1697. He was forty-seven.<br>
