<span class="headword">Vincent,  Augustine</span>  (<em>c.</em>1584&#150;1626), <span class="occ">herald and antiquary</span>, was born presumably at Wellingborough or Finedon, Northamptonshire, the third and youngest son of William Vincent (<i>d</i>. 1618) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Mabbott of Walgrave, merchant of the staple. Nothing is known of his education. About 1599 he obtained a post in charge of records in the Tower of London, where he was probably simply a clerk but acquired a reputation as an antiquary. On 30 June 1614 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1667), third daughter of Francis Primecourt of Canterbury. In 1616 he was given the position of Rouge Rose pursuivant-extraordinary in the College of Arms, almost certainly through the influence of his friend William Camden, who had been made Clarenceux king of arms in 1597. In spite of criticism of the practice from opponents resentful of Camden's promotion, the king of arms made use of Vincent as his deputy in heraldic visitations, alone in Northamptonshire and Rutland in 1618&#150;19, with others in Warwickshire and Leicestershire in 1619 and in Surrey and Shropshire in 1623. Vincent played a prominent part in the celebrated public quarrel between Camden and Ralph Brooke, York herald, contributing, in defence of Camden, <span class="italic">A discoverie of errours in the first edition of the catalogue of nobility published by Ralphe Brooke</span> (1622), essentially a reprint of Brooke's book, in sections, with hostile comments after each. The dispute is notable for the way in which both sides made critical use of original source materials: while Brooke utilized the evidence of armorial bearings on tombs, Vincent employed his expert knowledge of the public records, something of an innovation in the scholarly argument of the day.<br>
<br>Over the years Vincent accumulated a very significant reference collection of heraldic and genealogical manuscript material, regarded as the most important collection attributable to a single herald at the College of Arms. It consists of 260 volumes, many of which were written by himself. In his <span class="italic">Discoverie of Errours</span> Vincent announced his intention to produce a &#145;Baronage of England&#146; and a &#145;Lives of all the knights of the Garter&#146; (foreshadowing William Dugdale), and that he was pursuing this as an active project is shown by the existence of a volume by him with 396 pages of peers' pedigrees, with painted arms. As he observed to Sir Robert Cotton, &#145;I find the further I go in that labour the further I am to seeke, yet it shall not discourage me&#146;  (Nicholas, 75).<br>
<br>Vincent's further intention was to write a county history for Northamptonshire. His collection of manuscripts contains a substantial body of Northamptonshire material; he is known to have collected information about armorial bearings in the county during his visitation. The papers accumulated by the Northamptonshire antiquary John Bridges in preparation for his own <span class="italic">History of Northamptonshire</span> include a copy of a list of headings under which Vincent intended to systematically consider his Northamptonshire material. Like many other contemporary antiquaries, however, overwhelmed by notes, Vincent did not manage to publish his work. None the less, his material was offered to, and made use of by, William Burton for his <span class="italic">Description of Leicestershire</span> (1622), William Dugdale, and John Weever for his <span class="italic">Ancient Funerall Monuments</span> (1631). Weever was particularly grateful for Vincent's help and encouragement, symptomatic of a general tendency to share the fruits of research within antiquarian circles. In Vincent's case, the circle also included John Selden.<br>
<br>Vincent's position within the College of Arms was regularized in May 1621 when he became Rouge Croix pursuivant; in June 1624 he became Windsor herald. He died on 11 January 1626 and was buried on 14 January at St Benet Paul's Wharf, London. His widow married, before 30 November 1630, Eusebius Catesby of Castor, Northamptonshire; she died on 6 August 1667.<br>
<br>Vincent's son John (1618&#150;1671) was also interested in genealogical and antiquarian matters, although not possessing the scholarly abilities of his father. He took over his father's manuscript collections and made additions to them, finishing, but not managing to publish, the work on the baronage. When he died he bequeathed the collection to his patron, Ralph Sheldon of Beoley, Worcestershire, who left them to the College of Arms in 1684.<br>
