<span class="headword">Du Moulin,  Pierre</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1676), <span class="occ">political propagandist</span>, was born in Dunois, France, the son of Cyrus Du Moulin (<i>b</i>. 1608), a Reformed church minister, and his wife, Marie de Marbois or Marbais. He came from a family of distinguished Huguenot scholars, which included his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19430/', "Pierre Du Moulin (1568&#150;1658)")</script>, and uncles <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19429/', "Peter Du Moulin (1601&#150;1684)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19428/', "Lewis Du Moulin (1605?&#150;1680)")</script>. It is not known where Du Moulin was educated, but he had a knowledge of classical languages and of English, Spanish, Dutch, and French. The date of his arrival in England is uncertain, but he was naturalized by act of parliament in May 1664.<br>
<br>Du Moulin found work as a clerk in the office of the secretary of state, Sir Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington from 1665. With Arlington as a patron, Du Moulin then embarked on a career in the diplomatic service. He served as secretary to the envoy Sir Gilbert Talbot in Denmark (1664&#150;6) and to the ambassador Sir Thomas Clifford in Denmark and Sweden (1665&#150;6). Talbot was impressed by Du Moulin's abilities and recommended him as &#145;a man of very good parts, and perfect honesty&#146;  (Haley, 17). The following year Du Moulin joined the entourage of the English ambassadors at the peace negotiations with the Dutch at Breda, whence he supplied Arlington with political and military intelligence. A warrant exists appointing Du Moulin as assistant to the master of ceremonies, Sir Charles Cotterell, but if he held this office it was not for long, as in March 1668 Clement Cotterell was named to the post. From February to August 1668 Du Moulin was secretary to Sir John Trevor, envoy-extraordinary to France, the French ambassador to England noting that Du Moulin was highly intelligent and in Arlington's confidence. In October 1668 Du Moulin was appointed secretary to the council of trade, following a recommendation from Arlington and against a nominee of the duke of York, but at the beginning of 1669 he was named to the entourage of Ralph Montagu, the new ambassador-extraordinary to France: his post was not that of secretary to the ambassador, but Montagu was told it would &#145;do well for his credit to let it pass so&#146;  (ibid., 20). Du Moulin, however, did not find relations with Montagu easy, and, given the new pro-French direction of English foreign policy, his days in favour were numbered. He was recalled after only a few months and left for England on 26 June 1669.<br>
<br>Du Moulin continued to serve the council of trade, but he was increasingly out of sympathy with the new pro-French foreign policy, and especially with the Dutch war which began at the start of 1672. He eventually left England following an order from the privy council on 31 July 1672 for his arrest for visiting the Dutch deputies residing at Hampton Court. He blamed three years' persecution by his former patron, Arlington, for his predicament. Du Moulin now entered the service of William, prince of Orange, who had been stadholder of the states general since June. In the autumn of 1672 Du Moulin wrote to his English contacts soliciting information upon which to base Dutch policy, and as early as September 1672 Dutch agents were active in England following policies developed by Du Moulin in a series of memoranda to William. Initially the aim was to divide the English ministers, particularly the earls of Lauderdale and Shaftesbury. However, hopes of disrupting the Franco-English alliance came to focus on influencing parliament to refuse to grant supplies for carrying on the war. It was in these circumstances that Du Moulin penned <span class="italic">England's Appeal from the Private Cabal at Whitehall to the Great Council of the Nation</span>, which may have been in Arlington's possession at the end of January 1673, but which became widely available in England only in March, near the end of the parliamentary session.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1673 Du Moulin was employed by William as a confidential secretary to deal with foreign correspondence, and he continued his efforts to force England out of the war. Meanwhile in England there was a marked growth in anti-French sentiment, for which <span class="italic">England's Appeal</span> had some responsibility, with its clever play on the consequences of the French alliance for England's politics, religion, and trade. The result was two very uncomfortable parliamentary sessions for Charles II's ministers in October&#150;November 1673 and January&#150;February 1674, which forced England to the negotiating table, a peace with the Dutch being signed on 19 February 1674.<br>
<br>In 1674 Du Moulin was still serving as William's secretary, but English ministers were determined to use the desire of William for good relations with Charles II to force him from favour, and Arlington came to the Netherlands with the intention of forcing his dismissal. Du Moulin, realizing his position could not be sustained, wished to be appointed governor of Surinam, but this required the assent of all the Dutch provinces and for some time Zeeland proved recalcitrant. Du Moulin's last official letter to William was written on 17 November 1674, although he was still available to offer informal advice. In the summer of 1675 Du Moulin was sent as Dutch representative to the imperial general Montecuculi.<br>
<br>Du Moulin's commission as governor of Surinam was dated 24 February 1676, and he was also voted a pension of 1600 gulden. However, he never took up his post. On 13 June 1676 he took a vomit which caused him to burst several blood vessels, and he died at The Hague, &#145;strangled in his blood&#146;  (Haley, 217). He was buried in the Kloosterkerk in The Hague on 16 June, and his papers were seized by the judge of the high court of the Netherlands to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.<br>
