<span class="headword">Parker,  Robert John</span>, Baron Parker of Waddington  (1857&#150;1918), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 25 February 1857 at Claxby rectory, Lincolnshire, the second son of the Revd Richard Parker, incumbent of Claxby, and his wife, Elizabeth Coffin. His sister Ellen [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35531/', "Pinsent, Dame Ellen Frances")</script>] became a leading promoter of mental health services. He was educated at Westminster School and Eton College, where he was Newcastle medallist, before matriculating on 13 October 1876 at King's College, Cambridge. There he became a scholar in 1876 and a fellow in 1881 at an unusually young age. He won the Browne's medal for the Greek ode in 1878 and in 1880 was bracketed fifth in the first class of the classical tripos; he obtained his BA in the same year and his MA in 1888.<br>
<br>Parker was admitted as a student to Lincoln's Inn on 3 November 1883 and was called to the bar on 17 November in the same year. He first read under and later worked with Ingle Joyce. He soon developed a thriving practice, was esteemed for his pleadings and later had many pupils of his own. He never took silk, preferring to remain as junior counsel to the Treasury, a position he held from 1900, when Joyce was made a judge. On 9 September 1884 he married Constance (<i>d</i>. 1937), only child of John Trevor Barkley, civil engineer; they had three sons, Trevor, John, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31527/', "Hubert Lister Parker")</script>, a future lord chief justice, and two daughters, Vivien and Gwendoline.<br>
<br>Parker remained relatively obscure until 1906 when he was made a Chancery judge. He began to make his mark in trying patent cases and in settling the practice under the <span class="roman">Patents and Designs Act</span> (1907). Having delivered a judgment in a case relating to Marconi's &#145;wireless telegraphy&#146; patents in 1913, he was appointed chairman of a technical committee to advise the postmaster-general as to the choice to be made among the five then competing systems. On 1 May 1913 the committee reported in favour of Marconi's.<br>
<br>The death of Lord Macnaghten on 17 February 1913 had made a vacancy for a lord of appeal, for which a leading equity lawyer was required. As a Chancery judge Parker had often sat as an additional member of the Court of Appeal, and on 4 March was promoted to the House of Lords. He was duly sworn of the privy council and took the title of Baron Parker of Waddington in Yorkshire, from the younger branch of the Parkers of Browsholme, to which his family belonged. It was most unusual for a junior barrister to be promoted so rapidly to the House of Lords. Even Lord Blackburn, who was similarly promoted, had sat on the bench for many years. From the outset the profession recognized Parker as a great addition of legal strength to the House of Lords and he gained an authoritative position as a judge of final appeal during the years in which he sat there. His ability to assimilate new law and make it his own was very clear, especially in relation to the prize appeals heard during the First World War. Although the subject was novel to a Chancery lawyer and would have tested the best Admiralty practitioner, Parker was quick to familiarize himself with the decisions and to grasp the intricate practice which prevailed at that time under Lord Stowell. Parker remained on the board of appeal until shortly before his death, taking over as president after Lord Mersey. His ability to harmonize the precedents of past wars with the exigencies of the First World War was obvious, especially in the <i>Roumanian</i> and <i>Zamore</i> cases.<br>
<br>Parker acted as deputy high steward of Cambridge University between 1915 and 1918, a time when he also sat as the president of the judicial committee and the privy council (appointed to succeed Lord Mersey in 1916). Examples of his characteristic methods of proceeding, both as an ordinary judge and as a lord of appeal, as well as of his remarkable range, can be found in his verdicts on <i>Johnson v. Clark</i> (a local custom of Kendal); <i>Fitzhardinge v. Purcell</i> (sporting rights on the foreshore of the Severn); <i>Jones v. Pritchard</i> (rights and obligations as to party-walls); <i>Monks v. Whiteley</i> (equitable doctrine of merger); <i>Barry v. Minturn</i> (an early House of Lords judgment which Parker's colleagues were satisfied to adopt without additions); <i>Attorney-General for the Commonwealth v. Adelaide Steamship Company</i> (combinations in restraint of trade); <i>Kreglinger v. New Patagonian Company</i> (clogging the equity of redemption); <i>Trim School v. Kelly</i> (murder as an accident arising out of and in the course of a schoolmaster's employment); <i>Stickney v. Keeble</i> (of what contracts time is of the essence); <i>Tamplin Steamship Company v. Anglo-Mexican Company</i> (frustration of a commercial adventure); <i>Continental Tyre Company v. Daimler Company</i> (the doctrine of enemy character as applied to British incorporated companies during war); <i>Admiralty Commissioners v. SS America</i> (the right to sue in respect of another person's loss of life); <i>Bowman v. Secular Society</i> (illegality of anti-Christian associations); and <i>Banbury v. Bank of Montreal</i> (authority of agents to bind principals by representations to third parties).<br>
<br>The most striking characteristic of Parker's judgments was their intellectual compactness. He was always more interested in substance than in form and his method was to state a legal principle and to bring the case within it. He was concerned not only with the correctness of a decision but also with the reputation and independence of the tribunal. For example, in a case which concerned the interests of working men, the house was divided as four to three (the four being of one political party and the three of the other). Parker, who was in the minority, thought that the result would cast the judiciary into disrepute, and so suggested to one of his colleagues on the other side that they should read one another's judgments, an offer which was declined.<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out, Parker was one of the first to see the danger of allowing prices and the cost of living to increase rapidly and unreasonably; and, at the time of the &#145;business as usual&#146; cry, he took steps to urge his views on ministers privately. He met with no success. During 1915 he gave much thought to the problems of post-war reconstruction and brought the subject before the House of Lords in an elaborate and characteristically condensed address on 14 December 1915. During the passage of the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> of 1918 he took up the cause of those women who had passed university examinations but been denied the right to take up their degrees, and, speaking both as an alumnus and deputy high steward of Cambridge University, pressed on the House of Lords the right of women to vote for the representation of their university in parliament. In this he was successful.<br>
<br>Parker's most noteworthy contribution to debate on public affairs was made in 1918, shortly before he died. On the occasion of a motion by Lord Parmoor on 19 March 1918 in favour of a league of nations, Parker brought before the house a detailed scheme, which went far beyond mere utopian sentiment to suggest practical details of how such a league might be formed; his plan contained twenty articles by which a league could be refined.<br>
<br>Parker's health at this stage, however, was already beginning to fail. He continued to work until the summer of 1918 but died, after a short illness, on 12 July at Aldworth, the first Lord Tennyson's old home near Lurgashall in Sussex, where he had lived since 1914. As well as maintaining Browsholme Lodge in Haslemere, Surrey, he and Constance had lived at 3 Buckingham Gate in London. Constance and his three sons and two daughters survived him. Lord Parker was one of the most esteemed judges of the early twentieth century.<br>
