<span class="headword">Diodati,  Theodore</span>  (1573&#150;1651), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Geneva on 23 August 1573, the eldest of ten children of Carlo Diodati (1541&#150;1625), a merchant banker, and his second wife, Maria Mei. The family was from the northern Italian town of Lucca, where they had been prominent in public life. Family tradition identifies Carlo's godfather and namesake as the emperor Charles V. Despite this tie Carlo Diodati was converted to protestantism and was settled in Calvinist Geneva by 1567. He prospered there in banking and silk manufacture, was a leader in the Italian reformed church, and a member of the Genevan town council from 1584 to 1619.<br>
<br>Among other accomplishments some Diodatis had pursued the practice of medicine in Lucca. This tradition was carried on by Theodore Diodati who matriculated in medicine at Leiden, on 3 August 1594. He did not take a degree at this time but a 1596 thesis of his, on smallpox and measles, survives and was dedicated to his medical professor Peter Paaw, and to Marc Offredi, a Genevan physician who had encouraged his medical studies. Diodati remained at Leiden until 1598, at which time he accepted employment in England as a tutor to John Harington, the six-year-old son of Sir John Harington of Exton. Diodati was mentioned in this capacity in 1603 in John Florio's classic English translation of Montaigne's <span class="italic">Essais</span>, on which Diodati had assisted.<br>
<br>Attendance on the Haringtons brought Diodati into the orbit of the court of James I. The care and education of Princess Elizabeth eventually became the responsibility of Sir John Harington, while his son became the boon companion of Prince Henry. Diodati was both tutor and physician to the royal children in 1609, although by this time he had his own house in Brentford, Middlesex. He was now also practising more widely and gained great fame by curing a 76-year-old neighbour with a heroic phlebotomy, taking 60 ounces of blood over a three-day period, without any ill effect to the aged patient.<br>
<br>About this time, if not earlier, Diodati married an Englishwoman &#145;of good birth and fortune&#146;  (Dorian, 51). Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7679/', "Charles Diodati")</script>, was born in 1609 or 1610. The younger Diodati achieved eternal fame as the best and most intimate friend of John Milton, from their schooldays together in London until Charles Diodati's early death in 1638. It has been suggested that Milton found aristocratic patrons for his earliest poetry through the medium and connections of the elder Diodati. A son, John, and a daughter, Philadelphia, followed the birth of Charles.<br>
<br>Diodati's medical practice continued to prosper and by 1612 he was well known enough as a physician to earn an epigram in print from the famous epigrammatist, John Owen, who played on the uniqueness of Diodati's Greek Christian name and his Latinate surname, both of which can be roughly translated as &#145;God's gift&#146;, and linking that meaning with the injunction in <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span> to honour the physician because he has been given to men as a gift from God.<br>
<br>In the same year that Diodati received his epigram he was also reported to the College of Physicians for his unlicensed medical practice in London, suggesting that Diodati had moved that practice to the City of London proper. To strengthen his credentials Diodati returned to Leiden where, on 19 September 1615, he took his long delayed MD. He appeared before the London college, degree in hand, in 1616 and was eventually licensed by the college on 24 January 1617. Even then his relationship with the college was often less than cordial: on one occasion he flung French curses at a Huguenot physician and college fellow, Paul Delaune, who had questioned Diodati's use of a vomit in a case they both attended. In 1622 the college censors vindicated Diodati's medical judgement and practice, but severely reprimanded him for his disrespectful behaviour towards other fellows and the officers of the college. Differences with other fellows seemed to be over matters of professional judgement rather than medical philosophy. Many of Diodati's conflicts at the college were personal in origin and seemed to stem from his own aristocratic bearing, pride, and a temperament that was quick to anger at even the slightest criticism. Despite these occasional differences Diodati remained a college licentiate in good standing for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Through all Diodati's tempests at the college he was always supported by the chief royal physician Theodore Turquet de Mayerne. Born in Geneva in 1573 within a month of each other, they were both descended from Italian protestant families of intellectual distinction. In 1622, during a typically nasty interchange at the College of Physicians, Diodati requested that Mayerne be present at the meeting. In 1628 Mayerne recommended Diodati in what turned out to be an unsuccessful petition for the office of physician to the Tower of London. Seventy of Diodati's bills or prescriptions can still be found among the Mayerne papers at the British Library.<br>
<br>Diodati's movements are fairly easy to track after his licensing by the college in 1617. A census of strangers residing in London found him and his family in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, in September 1618. A similar census placed him in Christchurch and St Faith's under St Paul's parishes in 1625. He was naturalized as an English subject on 9 January 1628, just prior to his application for the physicianship to the Tower. On the evidence of the annals of the College of Physicians, he was still in London in 1630. Gradually Diodati had built up his patient list among the English gentry and aristocracy, treating the families of Sir Thomas Egerton, Sir Richard Anderson, the earl of Bridgewater, and the countess of Derby.<br>
<br>Diodati's movements after 1630 remain something of a mystery. No longer in London, he seems to have been a travelling physician, serving the counties of England between Herefordshire and Lancashire, perhaps relocating his household to Chester, where his son Charles Diodati seems also to have practised medicine. During these years the elder Diodati added yet another prestigious family to his patient list, that of Sir Robert and Lady Brilliana Harley. By 1637 Diodati's first wife had died and he married a woman known only as Abigail. The marriage estranged Diodati from his children who, by 1638, had returned to London. In the summer of that year both Charles Diodati and his sister, Philadelphia, died and were buried in the parish church of St Ann Blackfriars.<br>
<br>Diodati continued his provincial practice until at least 1641, at which time he too had returned to London where he took up residency in the parish of St Bartholomew by the Exchange. In 1643 Diodati was assessed for &pound;100 by the parliamentary committee for the advance of money. Like most of those assessed, he settled for a lesser sum in 1644. He remained estranged from his surviving son, John Diodati, who had his own business in London. At least two of Diodati's nephews, Charles and Theodore Diodati, followed their uncle into the medical profession. The younger Theodore Diodati, along with the physician's wife, Abigail, were the principal legatees of Diodati's will, written in 1649. There was no mention in his will of his son, John Diodati.<br>
<br>Diodati died in the parish of St Bartholomew by the Exchange and was buried in the body of the church on 12 February 1651. His loan of &pound;1008 to the earl of Cleveland and his son was eventually repaid to his nephew Theodore in 1654 through the action of a parliamentary committee for confiscated estates.<br>
