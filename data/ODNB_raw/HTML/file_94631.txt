<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Johanneson,  Albert Louis</span>  (1940&#150;1995), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born in Germiston, South Africa, on 12 March 1940, the son of Louis Johanneson, mechanic, and his wife, Caroline. After playing for his hometown club of Germiston Colliers he was recommended to Leeds United by a local schoolteacher. Within days of signing professional forms in April 1961, he made his second division d&eacute;but at outside left against Swansea Town. His ability was in excess of the passion he had had for the game as a child and adolescent. In apartheid South Africa football was seen by him as &#145;a white man's game. When we did go to watch, the stadium was segregated, not home and away supporters, but black and white supporters &hellip; It was cheaper to go in to watch football as a white person&#146;  (Harrison, 57).<br>
<br>Recently relegated, Leeds United in 1961 was going through a difficult time. Discipline among the players was lax. The recent arrivals Johanneson, Eric Smith, and Bobby Collins, together with the new manager, Don Revie, helped revive and build Leeds into a successful first division side. On 27 February 1963, during Britain's coldest winter of the century, Johanneson married Norma Elaine Comrie, a hospital dispenser of Jamaican origin, at Blenheim Baptist Chapel, Woodhouse, Leeds. His new-found contentment helped his football. He finished as top scorer with fifteen goals in forty-one games at the end of the 1963&#150;4 season&#151;then a post-war club record for a winger&#151;helping the club win promotion to the first division. Over the next two seasons he continued to find the net frequently, scoring twelve goals in thirty-six games in 1964&#150;5, and twelve goals in twenty-eight games in 1965&#150;6. His team-mate Johnny Giles felt that Johanneson could have become &#145;one of the game's outstanding personalities&#146;  (Thomas, 33), on a par even with the brilliant George Best of Manchester United.<br>
<br>Small and wiry, Johanneson was remembered by Mark Rivlin as &#145;an exciting and intelligent player &hellip; darting in from the wing, leaving a defender gasping for air&#146;  (Rivlin, 10). Alan Roberts, the Leeds general manager, described him as &#145;very quick and very skilful but &hellip; a timid sort of man. Quiet, meek, unassuming&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 3 Oct 1995). He was known by supporters as &#145;Hurry, Hurry Johanneson&#146;, or &#145;the black flash&#146;.<br>
<br>Johanneson was the first black African to play in an FA cup final, against Liverpool in May 1965. He didn't have a good game. It marked the beginning of the end of his golden period, though he did feature in Leeds' first European competition, the Fairs cup, the following season. His form made a brief resurgence in the 1966&#150;7 season when he made twenty-eight first team appearances, but competition for places was increasing, with Eddie Gray, a future Scottish international, and Mike O'Grady vying for the outside left position. In 1970, after playing 172 games and scoring forty-eight league goals, Johanneson was transferred to York City. He made just twenty-six appearances for the club, scoring three goals, nonetheless helping York to promotion to the third division.<br>
<br>Johanneson once complained to Revie that the opposing full-back was calling him a &#145;Black bastard&#146;. &#145;Well&#146;, said the methodical manager, &#145;call him a White bastard&#146;  (Thomas, 52). With Johanneson usually the only black man on the field, such battles were often faced and felt alone. Fortunately, on the field, Jack Charlton and Billy Bremner took it upon themselves to become his minders. Off the pitch&#151;in the changing room, front room, or high street&#151;there were few or no support structures available to galvanize a battered confidence. To play well steeled the soul against such abuse; to play badly weakened that protection. To escape those contradictory pressures of limelight and isolation Johanneson eventually turned to drink and drugs. He had a lot to lose: a wife, and two daughters, Yvonne and Alicia. But his method of escape was one familiar to many black South Africans of the townships. His premature death on 28 September 1995 at his flat in Gledhow Towers, Leeds, from bronchopneumonia, meningitis, and heart disease&#151;alone, and in relative anonymity and poverty&#151;was the end of a long, slow, and tragic decline. Yet he was remembered by many spectators for the joy he brought as a footballer of unique talent.<br>
