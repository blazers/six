<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brandt,  Hermann Wilhelm <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1904&#150;1983), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 2 May 1904 in Hamburg (though he later encouraged the belief that he was born in south London), the second of four sons (there were no daughters) of Ludwig Walter Brandt, merchant (who had been born in London), and his wife, Louise (Lili) Merck. Perhaps because of the English connections of his family and the high feelings caused by the First World War, Brandt's schooldays were intensely unhappy. He contracted tuberculosis in his youth and at the age of twenty was sent to a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland. Two and a half years later he travelled to Vienna, seeking a cure by means of psychoanalysis, but doctors there pronounced him free of the disease. Through his younger brother Rolf, he became part of the brilliant artistic circle of Dr Eugenie Schwarzwald. She placed Brandt in the studio of Grete Kolliner, a leading portrait photographer, to learn photography. There he met Eva Boros, who was to become his first wife. Perhaps through the agency of Dr Schwarzwald, Ezra Pound sat for Brandt in 1928. The poet is said to have provided an introduction to Man Ray, in whose Paris studio the young photographer served as an assistant for three months in 1930. Brandt always spoke of this period with enchantment. He was thrilled by the films of Dal&iacute; and Bu&ntilde;uel and inspired by the enormous new possibilities offered by the surrealist movement in its heyday.<br>
<br>Brandt continued his apprenticeship in Paris, making observant street photographs which became part of his classic <i>&#339;uvre</i>. In typically cosmopolitan style, he married his Hungarian wife, Eva (daughter of Joseph Boros), in Barcelona in 1932. They settled in London in 1934 and Brandt began to publish his photographs in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. His first impressions of England were collected in his first book, <span class="italic">The English at Home</span> (1936). The book is notable for its pointed contrasts of upper- and working-class life, but also for Brandt's sheer relish for the mysteries and rituals of Englishness. He had privileged access to these through various Brandt uncles and their households. Friends and family acted out various roles in Brandt's photographs. His master in the art of documentary photography, or photojournalism, was the Paris-based Transylvanian Brassai, whose beneficial influence was even more in evidence in Brandt's <span class="italic">A Night in London</span> (1938). Influenced by J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">English Journey</span> (1934) and the widespread concerns aroused by the Jarrow crusade (1936), Brandt and his wife travelled to Yorkshire and the north-east in 1937. He made the definitive images of coal-searchers, although these were not published until the next decade, and of the bleak beauty of the (then) coal-black cities such as Halifax. Soon he was photographing the eerie tranquillity of blacked-out London during the phony war. He had a stimulating editor and friend in Tom Hopkinson, for whom he worked with great creativity and productiveness at <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> (founded 1936) and <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> (founded 1938). In the 1940s he also began to take commissions from Carmel Snow, the dashing editor of <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>, through which Brandt's work became well known to an American audience. Aside from the magazines, Brandt received other commissions. For the Ministry of Information he produced his famous photographs of London's makeshift bomb shelters in underground stations and their rows of sleeping occupants. For the National Buildings Record he photographed major monuments. During the 1940s Brandt produced two more great series: his portraits of young writers and his landscapes. The former included such stars as Elizabeth Bowen (to whose writings he was particularly drawn), Robert Graves, and Dylan Thomas. The landscapes&#151;a reflection of national identity in a time of war&#151;feature places associated with the Bront&euml;s, Thomas Hardy, Dr Johnson, and others. The series originally appeared in <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> and was republished, with further images, in Brandt's third classic book, <span class="italic">Literary Britain</span>, introduced by John Hayward, in 1951.<br>
<br>In 1944 Brandt embarked on yet another exploration. He acquired a mahogany and brass-view camera with a wide-angle lens. It was actually a Kodak camera made for police work, but Brandt used it to photograph the nude. The ground glass yielded only an indistinct image of the subject, and Brandt had to work almost &#145;blind&#146;. He later said that he chose this camera because he wanted to see differently, &#145;like a mouse, a fish or a fly&#146;. The wide-angle lens dramatically expanded and diminished the figure like an episode from <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span>, a book in which Brandt&#151;like other surrealists&#151;delighted. Brandt's vision of the nude was more directly informed by his admiration for Arp, Matisse, Moore, and Picasso. The series began in domestic interiors but was later extended to beaches in southern England and France. Brandt found that a Hasselblad with a Superwide lens could give him the same results as the old Kodak, and he also used the newer camera for his later portraits. <span class="italic">Perspective of Nudes</span> appeared in 1961, followed by a career survey, <span class="italic">Shadow of Light</span>, in 1966. These books, and a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1969), and the Hayward Gallery, London (1970, followed by a UK tour), brought Brandt to the attention of a new generation. Lucky pilgrims were welcomed by Brandt to his second-floor flat in Airlie Gardens, Kensington, to find an enchanting interior that was at once Victorian, surrealist, and contemporary, with stuffed seabirds recalling his landscapes, Brandt's own collages formed of beach-combed seaweeds and shells, and lively modern painted reliefs by his brother Rolf. They found that Brandt himself was unexpectedly boyish, fond of laughter&#151;and lovable. He was also genuinely modest. He must have charmed a large audience when he claimed, in a BBC television documentary about him in 1983, that &#145;anyone could have taken&#146; his famous picture of maids ready to serve dinner (1936).<br>
<br>It was mainly because of Brandt that the climate of opinion about photography changed in Britain. Photography was habitually thought of as the preserve of celebrity portraitists, commercial dullards, and fashionable chancers, but Brandt showed that photography could be informed by the imagination and create works of subtle, profound, visual art. This was recognized by many accolades in his later years: an honorary degree from the Royal College of Art in 1977, an award as royal designer for industry in 1978, and an honorary fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society in 1980. He was represented by Marlborough Fine Art in London and New York and exhibited and published widely until his death.<br>
<br>Bill Brandt&#151;Billy to his closest friends&#151;was tall, fair-haired, slim, and handsome, with a beautiful smile and a surprisingly hearty laugh. He always kept a slight accent, but in later life he refused to admit to being German or even to speaking the language. Tom Hopkinson said that Brandt had a voice &#145;as loud as a moth&#146;. He was ultra-sensitive, private, and shy, and suffered from diabetes. Despite his apparent frailty, Brandt was&#151;for many&#151;the most vigorous, compelling, and poetic photographer working in Britain in modern times. His archive is kept at his former home in London; major retrospectives were held at the Edwynn Monte Gallery, New York, in 2001, and at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 2004.<br>
<br>Brandt's second wife, whom he met in the late 1930s, was Marjorie (<i>d</i>. 1971), daughter of Henry James Becket. On 21 December 1972 he married Dorothy Anne (Noya) Kernot, widowed daughter of Ivan Leslover. Brandt died at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London, on 20 December 1983.<br>
