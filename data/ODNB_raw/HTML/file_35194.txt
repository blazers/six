<span class="headword">Neil,  Samuel</span>  (1825&#150;1901), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and writer</span>, born in Edinburgh on 4 August 1825, was the second of the three sons of James Neil, an Edinburgh bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Lindsay, a connection of the Lindsays, earls of Crawford. On the death of James Neil from cholera in 1832, the family went to live in Glasgow. After education at the old grammar school there, Neil entered the University of Glasgow; while an undergraduate, he assisted the English master in the high school and worked for the <span class="italic">Glasgow Argus</span> (of which the poet Charles Mackay was editor), and other newspapers. On 7 April 1848 he married Christina Gibson, the youngest daughter of Archibald Gibson, who had served in the navy and had been with Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar. For a time Neil was a private tutor, and then master successively of Falkirk charity school in 1850, of Southern Collegiate School, Glasgow, in 1852, and of St Andrew's School, Glasgow, in 1853. Finally he was rector of Moffat Academy from 1855 to 1873.<br>
<br>Neil combined much literary activity with his work in education. He promoted in 1857, and edited during its existence, the <span class="italic">Moffat Register and Annandale Observer</span>, the first newspaper published in Moffat, and he wrote regularly for other Scottish periodicals and educational journals. In 1850 he planned, and from that date until 1873 edited, the <span class="italic">British Controversialist</span> (40 vols. in all), a monthly magazine published in London for the discussion of literary, social, and philosophic questions. He himself contributed numerous philosophical articles, many of which he subsequently collected in separate volumes. Of these his <span class="italic">Art of Reasoning</span> (1853) was praised for its clarity and conciseness by John Stuart Mill, George Henry Lewes, Archbishop Whately, and Alexander Bain. Other contributions to the <span class="italic">British Controversialist</span> were published independently, under the titles of <span class="italic">Elements of Rhetoric</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Composition and Elocution</span> (1857), and <span class="italic">Public Meetings and how to Conduct them</span> (1867).<br>
<br>On resigning his rectorship of Moffat Academy in 1873 Neil settled in Edinburgh, devoting himself to English literature, and especially to Shakespeare. He founded and was president of the Edinburgh Shakespeare Society, and gave the annual lecture from 1874 until his death. To the <span class="italic">British Controversialist</span> in 1860 he contributed a series of papers which he reissued in 1861 as <span class="italic">Shakespeare: a Critical Biography</span>. The work enjoyed a vogue as a useful epitome of the facts, although Neil accepted without demur the forgeries of John Payne Collier. It was translated into French and German. Neil, who was a frequent visitor to Warwickshire, issued a guide to Shakespeare's birthplace at Stratford upon Avon as <span class="italic">The House of Shakespeare Described</span> (1871), and he edited the <span class="italic">Library Shakespeare</span> (3 vols.) in 1875, besides several separate plays for school use. His other publications included <span class="italic">British History</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Student's Handbook of Modern History</span> (1857), <span class="italic">Martin Luther</span> (1863), and <span class="italic">The Art of Public Speaking</span> (1867). Neil edited and compiled a large part of <span class="italic">The Home Teacher: a Cyclopaedia of Self-Instruction</span> (6 vols., 1886).<br>
<br>Neil took a leading part in educational and philanthropic affairs in Edinburgh, where he was on intimate terms with professors John Stuart Blackie, Henry Calderwood, John Veitch, and David Masson. He helped to found the Educational Institute of Scotland for granting fellowships to teachers. He compiled a book of poems by and about blind people, entitled <span class="italic">Dark Days Brightened</span>, for the Craigmillar School for the Blind in Edinburgh, which he managed for some years.<br>
<br>In 1900 Neil's health failed. He died on 28 August 1901, while on a visit at Sullom manse, Shetland, the residence of his son-in-law, the Revd Charles Davidson, and was buried on 1 September in Sullom churchyard. His wife predeceased him on 26 January 1901. They had three sons and five daughters, of whom one son and three daughters, all married, survived him.<br>
