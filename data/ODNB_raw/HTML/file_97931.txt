<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lashly,  William</span>  (1867&#150;1940), <span class="occ">polar explorer</span>, was born at Hambledon, Hampshire, on 25 December 1867, the fourth of the seven children of John Lashly (1833&#150;1903), a farm labourer and thatcher, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tucker (1838&#150;1918). He attended the village school in Hambledon until the age of thirteen, when he began work with his father. In 1889 he joined the Royal Navy, and saw service as a stoker in the Indian Ocean and West Indies. On 19 October 1896 he married Alice Cox (1870&#150;1940), the daughter of Charles Cox, a carpenter, also of Hambledon; they had one daughter, Alice, born in 1900.<br>
<br>In 1901 Lashly volunteered to serve on Captain Scott's &#145;national Antarctic expedition&#146;: the expedition ship <i>Discovery</i> left British waters on 7 August. According to Scott, Lashly's appearance was &#145;the most deceptive&#146; of any man he had ever seen. He was not more than ordinarily tall or broad, yet he had &#145;one of the largest chest measurements in the ship&#146;, and was, at 13 stone 8 pounds, surprisingly heavy. Quiet and unassuming, he neither smoked nor drank, and &#145;was never in anything but the hardest condition&#146;. He gave the impression of having great strength and energy in reserve  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 96/4, 303).<br>
<br>Lashly was a member of the <i>Discovery</i>'s six-man &#145;balloon section&#146;, which underwent training at Aldershot before departure. In Antarctica, though, only Scott and two others, one of them Ernest Shackleton, were able to ascend, on 3 February 1902, before rising winds stopped the experiment. Ashore Lashly proved himself an efficient and versatile handyman. He was well suited to the rigours of expedition life, and wrote home in February 1903: &#145;the best of it is the sledge trips which we did plenty &hellip; of course I don't mean to say it is all honey dragging 200 pounds behind ever[y] day for a month or 6 weeks but you are never healthier in your life&#146;  (William Lashly to Charles and Catherine Lashly, Feb 1903, Scott Polar RI, MS 1924/1).<br>
<br>As the polar winter drew to a close Scott planned a major sledge journey up the Ferrar glacier, starting out on 12 October. The arduous man-hauling on the high plateau of Victoria Land forced Scott to reduce his six-man party to three, on 22 November, and he kept with him only Lashly and the Welshman Petty Officer Edgar Evans. For another month they pressed westwards. On 14 December, struggling to find their route in fog, all three fell 300 feet down an ice-fall. They were fortunate not to break any bones, and also to discover at the bottom that they were within 6 miles of the food depot for which they had been searching. While <i>en route</i> for this depot, however, Scott and Evans fell to the length of their harness in a deep crevasse. Lashly managed to brace himself and prevent the sledge&#151;which now straddled the gap&#151;from falling in after them, and taking him with it.<br>
<br>After the <i>Discovery</i> returned home in September 1904 Lashly was promoted to chief stoker, and he was later made an instructor at the Royal Navy College at Osborne. When Scott began recruiting for the <span class="italic">Terra Nova</span> expedition of 1910, with the south pole as his goal, he selected Lashly and Evans, alongside the Irishman Tom Crean, another prized veteran of the <i>Discovery</i>, from among the thousands who volunteered. The <i>Terra Nova</i> left Cardiff for the south on 15 June 1910, and made a final stop at Port Chalmers in New Zealand on 29 November to take on more coal. The ship came close to foundering in a force 10 gale (1&#150;3 December) and Lashly spent hours up to his neck in bilge water, with the ship rolling violently, trying to clear the hand pump.<br>
<br>On 4 January 1911 the expedition began to disembark at Cape Evans, where Lashly functioned as &#145;second engineer&#146; to Bernard Day, who was in charge of the expedition's three experimental caterpillar-track motors. One of these sank through the ice after being unloaded, and they were viewed, by Captain Oates in particular, as costly failures. After they were taken out of storage for the journey south, on 17 October 1911, the motors gave constant trouble. It was only by dint of Day's and Lashly's efforts that the motor party&#151;which included also Lieutenant Edward R. G. R. Evans and F. J. Hooper&#151;was ready to leave on time on 24 October. Thereafter the party made slow progress, never exceeding 7 miles a day&#151;ironically because the motors were constantly overheating. On one occasion Day and Lashly worked all night in -25&deg;F to dismantle one of the engines, and replace a connecting rod, but by 1 November both machines had finally given out. They had carried a load of about 3 tons just over 50 miles: henceforth the four-man motor party would become a single man-hauling unit. For Lashly and Lieutenant Evans it was the beginning of three months harnessed together.<br>
<br>On 21 November 1911 the motor party was overtaken by the main caravan, and on 11 December, at the foot of the Beardmore glacier, Scott organized his party into three four-man teams. On 22 December, after ascending the glacier, Scott reorganized again, sending home Edward Atkinson, Patrick Keohane, Charles Wright, and Cherry-Garrard. Lieutenant Evans and Lashly now joined &#145;Birdie&#146; Bowers and Tom Crean in what was clearly a second string to Scott's own team, which included Oates, Edgar Evans, and Edward Wilson. Traversing the polar plateau with his new companions Lashly marked his forty-fourth birthday (Christmas day 1911) by falling into a crevasse. He was hauled up to safety by his comrades, who wished him a &#145;happy Christmas&#146; and &#145;many happy returns&#146;. According to them his reply was &#145;unprintable&#146;  (Evans, 201) but Scott observed &#145;His fall has not even disturbed his equanimity&#146;  (Ellis, 132).<br>
<br>On new year's eve, working in intense cold, Lashly and Crean helped to shorten the party's sledges by 2 feet, thus improving their running. For both men it was a last service rendered directly to Scott. On 3 January 1912 Scott announced his decision to take his team, with the addition of Bowers, to the summit. Cherry-Garrard later lamented this outcome: &#145;If Scott had only taken a four-man party and Lashly to the Pole!&#146;  (Seaver, 247). Both Edward Wilson and Edward Atkinson also favoured Lashly over Edgar Evans  (Huntford, 467&#150;8). The latter, though, had established himself as the stronger man in Scott's mind, and when the decision was taken he must have appeared as such. On 27 December Scott had swapped Lashly and Evans in the traces, and found that his sledge felt lighter with the latter. And of the three teams that had ascended the Beardmore glacier it was Scott's, with Edgar Evans in it, that had proved the strongest. Lashly's own team had shown signs of tiredness, and understandably so, as he later explained: &#145;I should have most likely went to the pole only the party that went on had not been hauling so long as I had. Myself &amp; Mr Evans had hauled 360 miles before the other[s] commenced&#146;  (William Lashly to Charles Lashly, 29 Feb 1912, Scott Polar RI, MS 1924/4).<br>
<br>On 4 January 1912 the remaining two parties separated at lat. 87&deg;32' S after an emotional farewell. Lashly's party, led by Lieutenant Evans, and weakened by the loss of Bowers, was now obliged to make all speed. They began well, but three days of blizzards (8&#150;10 January) pushed them off course, and on 12 January they found themselves at the top of the Shackleton ice-falls, with the equally unpalatable alternatives of a three-day detour around them, or an uncontrolled glissade down. On 17 January, in thick mist, they veered off course again, and were compelled to take extreme risks, traversing one ice bridge across a crevasse that Crean famously labelled &#145;the crossbar to the H of Hell&#146;. Having survived the Beardmore glacier they made good time, but, just as things were looking up, Evans began to show the first symptoms of the scurvy that would soon incapacitate him. Though he won Lashly's admiration for his pluck he became a burden on his comrades. Refusing Evans's requests to leave him, Lashly and Crean strapped Evans to the sledge and dragged him until, on 18 February, he fell unconscious. By now they were at the limit of their own strength, and could pull no more. It was decided that Crean should attempt the last stretch to Hut Point, 35 miles away, alone, while Lashly nursed Evans. In a remarkable feat of endurance Crean had covered the distance by 3.30 a.m. next day, and raised the alarm. Lashly (whose name was often spelt Lashley in press reports of the expedition) and Crean were later (26 July 1913) presented with the Albert medal for saving Evans, who dedicated his epic <span class="italic">South with Scott</span> to the two men, and maintained contact with them until they died.<br>
<br>It was not until 10 April 1912&#151;when news reached Cape Evans from Hut Point&#151;that it was known that Scott and his companions had perished. Lashly later wrote to his brother, &#145;we were almost certain they were gone before that, as the temperatures &amp; the weather was beyond the endurance of any man&#146;  (William Lashly to Charles Lashly, stamped 18 Jan 1913, Scott Polar RI, MS 1924/5). Lashly and Crean were now included in the officers' councils, and were members of the search party that found Scott's tent on 12 November 1912, roughly 11 miles from One Ton Depot. Atkinson and Lashly were the first to enter, the latter emerging in tears. On 12 February 1913 the <i>Terra Nova</i> entered Lyttelton harbour in New Zealand with the white ensign at half mast.<br>
<br>After the expedition Lashly continued to serve in the navy, and was aboard HMS <i>Irresistible</i> when it was sunk in the Dardanelles while bombarding the Turkish defences there on 18 March 1915. He later served on HMS <i>Amethyst</i>, and was discharged from the navy in February 1919. Thereafter he worked as a customs and excise officer in Cardiff docks. In 1932 he returned to live at Hambledon in a house in West Street that he named Minna Bluff&#151;after the landmark that welcomed parties returning to Cape Evans from the south. He lectured on his polar experiences, and kept in contact with his former colleagues, even making several visits to see Captain Oates's mother. He died on 12 June 1940 at the Royal Hospital in Portsmouth and was buried in Hambledon.<br>
<br>Bill Lashly was perceived by his contemporaries as an archetype&#151;the utterly dependable, uncomplaining, ever ready &#145;other rank&#146;, upon whom Scott built two Antarctic expeditions. The impression is confirmed by the unwaveringly deferential tone of his diary, in which the officers and scientists of the expedition are always &#145;Mister&#146;, and his peers &#145;Crean&#146;, &#145;Evans&#146;, &#145;Keohane&#146;, and so on. But Lashly was also unusual as a rating in that he kept a diary at all; and posterity must be grateful that he did, for it is &#145;one of those ungrammatical plain statements which beat all eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Dec 1922). He is commemorated in Antarctica by the Lashly Mountains (lat. 77&deg;54' S, long. 159&deg;33' E)&#151;the most prominent of which is Mount Crean&#151;and the Lashly glacier (lat. 77&deg;57' S, long. 159&deg;50' E), both in Victoria Land.<br>
