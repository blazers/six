<span class="headword">Goschen <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>G&ouml;schen]</span>, Sir  (William) Edward</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1924), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at Eltham, Kent, on 18 July 1847, the youngest of the twelve children of Wilhelm G&ouml;schen (1793&#150;1866) and his wife, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1895), daughter of Wilhelm Ohmann and Henrietta Sim. Wilhelm G&ouml;schen, the son of a distinguished Leipzig publisher, had migrated to London and made a successful career in merchant banking. Five sons, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33478/', "George Joachim Goschen")</script> was the eldest, and five daughters reached maturity, and dropped the umlaut from the family name. Edward Goschen was educated at Rugby School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and twice represented the university at tennis. He was a member of the Church of England, and a regular attendant at morning service. In 1869 he entered the diplomatic service, serving briefly in the Foreign Office and thereafter in various capital cities around the world. In 1874, at Lyons in New York state, he married (Harriet) Hosta (1849&#150;1912), daughter of Darius Clarke. They had two sons. From 1891 until 1914 he kept a diary, the principal source for his life, parts of which were published in 1980. In 1900 he inherited Schloss Tentschach in Carinthia, Austria. He was made KCMG in 1901, GCVO in 1904, GCMG in 1909, and GCB in 1911.<br>
<br>Goschen's career included appointments to a succession of sensitive posts in the period before the outbreak of the First World War. From November 1898 to June 1900 he was minister in Belgrade, where he learned &#145;that in Servia Russia was always called &#147;L'Oncle&#148; and Austria &#147;La Tante&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 22 July 1899). Between 1900 and 1905 he was minister in Copenhagen, and in June 1905 he became ambassador in Vienna. The day after taking up his appointment in Vienna he called on Goluchowski, the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, with whom he discussed Morocco: &#145;I expect his arguments came from over the way and were made in Germany&#146;, he noted  (ibid., 24 June 1905). As regards foreign policy, he informed Sir Edward Grey on 13 December, Austria&#150;Hungary was &#145;well under the thumb of Germany&#146;  (TNA: PRO, FO 800/40). To this opinion he adhered when, in the following year, Goluchowski was succeeded by Alois von Aehrenthal.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1908, in the royal train, Edward VII informed Goschen that he was to be ambassador at Berlin. The king, Goschen recorded, &#145;did what he could to gild the blackest and most nauseous of pills&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 12 Aug 1908). While he was still in Vienna, in the autumn of 1908 British press denunciation of the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina provoked a reaction: Goschen's Viennese friends tended to be &#145;out of town&#146;. On 4 November, at a state banquet, Goschen had a &#145;turn up&#146; with Aehrenthal, who complained of British encouragement of the Serbs. Goschen told him he was &#145;responsible for the whole situation&#146;; Aehrenthal's riposte was to begin to talk about the Boers, for which Goschen &#145;gave him snuff&#146;. The next day Goschen went to take leave of Aehrenthal &#145;and found him all smiles&#146;  (ibid., 5 Nov 1908).<br>
<br>On arrival in Berlin on 8 November the Goschens were &#145;much depressed&#146;: they did not care for either the climate or the embassy. Goschen presented his credentials on 20 November. At first the Kaiser's demeanour was daunting, but after Goschen had improvised a speech, he smiled, shook hands warmly, and expressed friendly sentiments. Goschen was unenthusiastic about the various approaches made by Kiderlen-Waechter and Bethmann Hollweg, the chancellor, with a view to reaching an understanding: he thought that what was needed was an understanding by the Germans that Britain intended to maintain her naval superiority. Nothing significant came of successive conversations. Then, on 2 February 1912, amid deteriorating relations with Germany over Tirpitz's plans for naval expansion, the Foreign Office telegraphed, informing Goschen that communications with the Kaiser and the chancellor had taken place through Albert Ballin and Ernest Cassel, and summoning him to London immediately. He arrived three days later, saw Arthur Nicolson, the permanent under-secretary, and found that &#145;it is worse than I feared&#146;; his own position was &#145;most disagreeable&#146;. That evening he saw Grey, who told him Haldane was going to Berlin: Goschen's verdict was &#145;Pah! Underground work&#146;. Haldane arrived in Berlin on 8 February. Goschen had few hopes of his success, correctly not believing that Haldane could persuade Tirpitz to reduce his programme.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1914 Goschen was at Kiel for the regatta when news of the assassinations at Sarajevo arrived. He was apprehensive as to what this &#145;dreadful business&#146; might lead to, as he believed that &#145;the Austrians have for ages been looking for an excuse to trample on Servia&#146;. On personal grounds, too, he was &#145;very sorry&#146; as the archduke had always been &#145;nice and kind&#146; and his wife &#145;charming&#146;. Two days later Goschen left for England. On 27 July he was back in Berlin, where there was little he could do, except carry out instructions and report. On the afternoon of 4 August, he asked Jagow (secretary of state at the imperial foreign office) for an assurance that Germany would respect Belgium's neutrality. The request was refused. That evening he saw Jagow again, repeating his previous request and requiring a satisfactory answer by midnight. He again met with a refusal. He then had an unpleasant interview with Bethmann Hollweg. That evening the British embassy was stoned. Early on 6 August Goschen left Berlin. After his return to London, Goschen composed a report on his last days in Germany, which included an account of the interview with Bethmann Hollweg, who, Goschen related, expressed his anger that Britain should go to war over &#145;a scrap of paper&#146;.<br>
<br>Goschen retired from the diplomatic service in 1916 and was created a baronet. His wife had died in 1912, and his second son was severely wounded in the early days of the war. In retirement he lived near Christchurch, Hampshire. He died at 27 Lennox Gardens, Chelsea, on 20 May 1924 and was buried six days later at Flimwell, Sussex.<br>
<br>Goschen was a vigorous upholder of British policy. He did not identify himself with his father's country of origin: on the contrary, his diary and letters abound with animadversions on the German national character and nostalgic references to life in England. He was a devoted family man and an enthusiastic violinist; he engaged in numerous sporting activities. Except when a prey to lumbago, which made him irascible, he was of a genial disposition, and enjoyed the affection of his subordinates. In his later years he had abundant grey hair, bushy eyebrows, and a mainly white moustache and beard.<br>
