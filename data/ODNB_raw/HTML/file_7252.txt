<span class="headword">Davies,  Mary Ann <span class="st"> [Marianne]</span></span>  (1743/4&#150;1818), <span class="occ">instrumentalist and singer</span>, was the daughter of the flautist and composer Richard Davies (<i>d</i>. 1773) and sister of the soprano <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7227/', "Cecilia Davies")</script>. She is often found in reference books as Marianne Davies, the form of her name that she used when writing in French. At her first public appearance at the age of seven at Hickford's Great Room, London, on 30 April 1751 she played a harpsichord concerto by Handel and two flute concertos (one composed by herself) and sang. Two songs composed by her father in praise of her musical skills were published in the early 1750s. Mary Ann had annual benefit concerts in London until 1761; she continued to perform on both flute and harpsichord but was not advertised as singing again until 1760, when she also played an organ concerto. In autumn 1755 she went with her father to Dublin, where she played the flute between the acts at the Smock Alley Theatre. Back in London, she played the Irish tune &#145;Ellen a Roon&#146; at Covent Garden on 23 March 1756.<br>
<br>Mary Ann was the first to play Benjamin Franklin's new version of the musical glasses, his glassychord or armonica, introducing the instrument to the public at Bath and Bristol in January 1762. It became the family's main means of livelihood. For several weeks a venue was hired where Mary Ann gave performances on the armonica, sometimes accompanied by her father on the flute; she sang to her own armonica accompaniment and played the flute and harpsichord. Private demonstrations of the armonica were given and Mary Ann taught the harpsichord and singing. Such series took place in London in 1762&#150;4. Mary Ann played the armonica at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, in the winter of 1763&#150;4 and then gave armonica demonstrations and sang in Dublin oratorio performances organized by Passerini. The Davies family travelled to Paris after their 1764 London concerts and Mary Ann next played the armonica in London between June and August 1767. Her young sister, Cecilia, sang at the last three of these concerts.<br>
<br>The Davies family then began a European tour, armed with letters of recommendation from J. C. Bach and others stressing their musicality, virtue, and Roman Catholicism. In Vienna the sisters found favour with Empress Maria Theresa and lodged in the same house as Johann Adolf Hasse, who composed <span class="italic">L'armonica</span>, a cantata with words by Pietro Metastasio, for them to perform at a royal wedding in June 1769. Metastasio praised Mary Ann's skill and the &#145;uncommonly sweet, and celestial tones&#146; of her instrument  (Burney, <span class="italic">Metastasio</span>, 83). The family went on to Italy, and had a joyful reunion with the Mozart family at Milan in September 1771. (The date of their first meeting is not known.) In 1772 Cecilia sang at opera houses in Naples and Florence, after which the family returned to London.<br>
<br>With Cecilia's success Mary Ann no longer needed to give armonica performances. In her journal Fanny Burney blamed Mary Ann for Cecilia's problems at the Italian Opera in London. She described her as &#145;short, crooked &amp; <i>squat</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals</span>, 106). Mary Ann became ill and the sisters returned to the continent, meeting Franklin in Paris in 1778. In April 1783, after a further lengthy illness and the loss of their money through a failed investment, Mary Ann wrote from Florence to Franklin, her &#145;worthy Friend and Benefactor&#146;, unsuccessfully seeking his help in obtaining a pension from Marie Antoinette. The sisters were enabled to return to England in 1786 by the proceeds of a concert, at which they both performed, arranged by English residents of Florence at the instigation of the second earl of Mount Edgcumbe. Cecilia obtained a few more engagements but they later supported themselves by giving music lessons. Mary Ann was in poor health by 1813 and died in London, in late December 1818. She was buried on 5 January 1819 at St Marylebone. Cecilia remained devoted to her memory.<br>
