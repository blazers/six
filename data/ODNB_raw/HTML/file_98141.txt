<span class="headword">Lane,  Homer Terril</span>  (1875&#150;1925), <span class="occ">educationist and psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 22 September 1875 at Hudson, New Hampshire, USA, the second of five children of Samuel Augustus Lane, a labouring foreman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Terril. He spent his strict but happy childhood in Framingham, Massachusetts. He left high school after a year to become a delivery boy. In 1898 he married Cora Barney, daughter of the local police chief at Southborough, where Lane was then living and working in a drugstore and as a delivery man. They had two children, Raymond (<i>b</i>. 1899) and Cora (<i>b</i>. 1901). After his marriage Lane enrolled at the Sloyd Training School, Boston, which taught handicrafts, with a philosophy that students should not be forced to learn and that education should be manually orientated. In 1901, when he was both studying and teaching part-time at the school, his wife died of pneumonia. He spent a summer as relief teacher of woodwork at Pennsylvania State Reformatory and then, in 1903, married Mabel, his first wife's elder sister. They had two children, Priscilla (Polly) (<i>b</i>. 1904) and Allan (<i>b</i>. 1907).<br>
<br>After his second marriage Lane and his family moved to Detroit, where he taught. Later, influenced by Maria Montessori, pioneer of education for the very young, he was appointed Detroit's superintendent of playgrounds. His observation that when play was unorganized juvenile crime fell and when organized it rose led him to believe that much juvenile crime grew from suppressed play instincts. However, a claim that he had paid for a young unmarried woman to have an abortion&#151;he may have said this to make a point&#151;forced his resignation. He then worked for the Solvay Guild, a welfare organization for employees of the Solvay Process Company. Influenced by the movement to create &#145;junior republics&#146;, which allowed male juvenile offenders to learn responsibility through self-government, Lane subsequently founded the Ford Boys' Republic (named after the local philanthropist who donated $45,000) in Detroit. He discovered what was to be his guiding principle&#151;the regenerative power of love or, as he was to say, being on the side of the malefactor.<br>
<br>In 1912 Lane visited England to advise George Montagu on setting up a community in Dorset, on the lines of the junior republics, on a farm donated by Montagu's uncle, the earl of Sandwich. The Little Commonwealth would be co-educational and for those aged from a few months to nineteen years, some of whom would have come from asylums or orphanages, but the majority from reformatories. Within a year Lane became superintendent. The fifty or so &#145;citizens&#146; (as they were called) lived in cottages under the care of a housemother. He pioneered group therapy and shared responsibility, with rules devised by the citizens. He would often encourage wrongdoers in their revelry so that, as he claimed, it ceased to be fun. His approach was that of &#145;the path of freedom instead of imposed authority, of self-expression instead of a pouring-in of knowledge, of evoking and exploiting the child's natural sense of wonder, and curiosity instead of a repetitious hammering home of dull facts&#146;  (Wills, 20). He believed that the need for rules had to be realized, not imposed. As at the Ford Republic, the citizens were paid for their work and taxed. Lane eschewed most punishment as a means of correction, and promoted self-expression and respect for and approval of the child. He believed that a child's nature was good and positive but became negative and anti-social through adult interference and moral teaching.<br>
<br>In 1917 two female citizens ran away and then (with Lane's encouragement, as he believed that they would break down and admit to making things up) made allegations to the police that Lane had had &#145;immoral relations&#146; with them. The Home Office ordered an inquiry, but the report was never published. The charge was not proven but Lane was not exonerated. However, the Home Office ordered that Lane be removed and changes made. The governing committee, sympathetic to Lane, decided in July 1918 to close the Little Commonwealth in the hope that it would reopen after the war. It never did.<br>
<br>Lane then became a highly successful (but unqualified) psychotherapist and psychoanalyst in London. However, in 1925 he was arrested for failing to register as an alien. At his trial the earlier events were resurrected, along with allegations that &#145;indelicate water colours&#146;, &#145;French preventives&#146;, and incriminating letters from young women had been found in his home. Despite prominent supporters, who included the bishop of Liverpool, Albert David, the headmaster of the Liverpool Institute, Henry Simmonds, and Lady Betty Balfour (sister of Lord Lytton, governor of Bengal), Lane was sentenced to a month in prison with deportation recommended. To avoid both he agreed to leave for France voluntarily.<br>
<br>Lane was hubristic, sought the limelight, and developed a &#145;Christ identification&#146;. He accepted money from young female patients and may well have acted with them in a sexually improper manner. Yet despite his failings and human weaknesses he was to exert a deep influence, both in education and in the treatment of juvenile offenders. His disciples included A. S. Neill (whom Lane psychoanalysed), the founder and head of Summerhill School. David Wills ran residential communities that owed much to the Little Commonwealth, while Otto Shaw's Red Hill School in Kent mirrored much of its regime. Lane can also be seen as a pioneer of therapeutic communities.<br>
<br>Lane died of heart failure brought on by typhoid and pneumonia on 5 September 1925 in the American Hospital, Paris, four months after leaving England. His wife and daughter Polly were present, together with a former citizen, Jane Bird. He was cremated two days later at P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery.<br>
