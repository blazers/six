<span class="headword">Young,  Andrew John</span>  (1885&#150;1971), <span class="occ">poet and clergyman</span>, was born on 29 April 1885 at the Highland Railway Station, Elgin, Moray, the youngest of the four children of Andrew John Young (1845&#150;1939) and Maria (1845&#150;1925), daughter of Robert Adams, a commercial clerk in Glasgow. His father, from Perthshire, was the respected stationmaster at Elgin, but he took employment in insurance and the family moved to Edinburgh when Andrew was one and a half. Young attended James Gillespie's School and the Royal High School, where he was distinguished as an athlete rather than a scholar. He read moral philosophy at Edinburgh University from 1903 to 1907. In Edinburgh he befriended the brother artists W. W. and S. I. Peploe, and spent two summers in France learning to appreciate church architecture. While at university his older brother, a doctor, disappeared in Singapore having probably committed various criminal acts. This greatly distressed their father, a deeply religious man, and Andrew came close to a nervous breakdown. Thereafter, pressed by his father, he prepared for the ministry in the United Free Church of Scotland at New College, Edinburgh, where John Baillie, the theologian, became a lifelong friend. Throughout these early years Andrew Young was writing poetry. Some early verses, <span class="italic">Songs of Night</span>, were published by his father in 1910.<br>
<br>Completing his studies in 1912, Young became an assistant at Wallace Green church in Berwick upon Tweed before obtaining a charge as minister at the United Free church at Temple in Midlothian (1914&#150;19). Andrew had earlier met Janet Green (1883&#150;1969), a lecturer at Jordan Hill training college in Glasgow, and they married on 8 September 1914. Their son, Andrew, was born in 1915 and their daughter, Alison, in 1922. Young, inclined to be a pacifist, worked in YMCA camps in France towards the end of the First World War. Thereafter he became minister at the Presbyterian church in Hove (1920&#150;38), a position he secured after an inspired sermon. During the 1920s and 1930s Young wrote a succession of slim volumes of short reflective verses, seven of which were published between 1920 and 1931 by a bookseller friend, J. G. Wilson. He also wrote longer religious dialogues such as <span class="italic">Boaz and Ruth</span> (1920). His reputation as a poet of the first rank was made in the thirties with <span class="italic">Winter Harvest</span> (1933), meditations on religion and nature. While in his early works he had shown influence of Swinburne and later Georgianism, in this collection he found a distinctive voice which was enhanced by his intimate knowledge of botany. He consolidated his reputation with his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1936), and the modern mystery play <span class="italic">Nicodemus</span> (1936), with incidental music by Imogen Holst.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Young shared with George Bell, bishop of Chichester, his admiration for episcopalianism. He and Bell, who was very interested in modern poetry, were brought together in connection with a memorial to the poet Edward Thomas. Early in 1939 Young converted to the Church of England and in 1941 he obtained the rural parish of Stonegate, Sussex, where he remained until his retirement in 1959. He was made a canon of Chichester Cathedral (1948), and thus had a living at Yapton near Arundel until his death.<br>
<br>An amateur botanist, it was said that Young had seen for himself practically every British plant. He shared his highly specialized botanical knowledge in two entrancing books which illuminate both the man and his poems: <span class="italic">A Prospect of Flowers</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">A Retrospect of Flowers</span> (1950). They describe the extraordinary trouble he took to see individual species. He might plan holidays to coincide with the flowering of a particularly rare plant, or delay an appointment to see an interesting flower, as he explained in &#145;Spiked Rampion&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>At Uckfield; three good miles to walk<br>
</div>
<div>Watch creeping close on one o'clock;<br>
</div>
<div>Why did I linger in that lane?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Young's knowledge of and regard for the natural landscape of Britain formed the basis for the notable <span class="italic">A Prospect of Britain</span> (1956). Another book, <span class="italic">The Poet and the Landscape</span> (1962), and an entrancing series of prose poems, <span class="italic">The New Polyolbion</span> (1967), further these topographical themes.<br>
<br>Young's nature poems are remarkable: they are usually both concise and thought-provoking, yet striking in their range. They are about all kinds of flora and fauna, and about places he loved throughout the length and breadth of Britain, from <span class="italic">The Falls of Glomach</span> (&#145;Rain drifts forever in this place&#146;) to a <span class="italic">Cornish Flower Farm</span>:<blockquote>
<div>Here where the cliff rises so high<br>
</div>
<div>The sea below fills half the sky.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>His poetry was also often about suffering and death, and the culmination of his religious verse was <span class="italic">Into Hades</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">A Traveller in Time</span> (1958), two longer poems, which appeared separately at first, but which were brought together later as <span class="italic">Out of the World and Back</span> (1958). Iain Crichton Smith, the poet and critic, found some of Young's early work clumsy, but spoke of a fresh, precious &#145;union of precision, wit and strangeness&#146; in his lyrics, &#145;essentially and idiosyncratically Young&#146;  (Crichton Smith).<br>
<br>Young's circle of friends included fellow poets Christopher Fry, Ted Walker, John Arlott, and Leonard Clark, his literary executor, who edited his verse and published, <span class="italic">Prospect of a Poet</span> (1957), a book of tributes to him. He was honoured with an honorary degree of LLD by the University of Edinburgh in 1951, the Royal Society of Literature conferred an honorary fellowship on him, and he received the Queen's medal for poetry in 1952.<br>
<br>Young, who was physically sturdy and powerful, was described as being &#145;mistaken for a farmer up in town for the day&#146;. He was also &#145;rather a paradox, at once an uncommunicative man and a man of wit&#146;. He was always an eloquent preacher and able to socialize as ministers must, but he was by nature both solitary and taciturn. He enjoyed being an English clergyman, yet he remained Scottish in other ways, rather Calvinistic, for example, and one who never lost his Scottish accent. His wife, who had forgone a promising career in education, faithfully supported him, but Andrew's temper, a product perhaps of self-doubt, sometimes placed a strain on family relationships. Yet before Janet Young died on 12 March 1969 after a difficult illness, Andrew faithfully looked after her. Thereafter he preferred to live alone, causing his family much anxiety. After a fall he was obliged to enter various nursing homes, and he died peacefully at Ravenna House, Bognor Regis, on 25 November 1971. His funeral service was conducted at Chichester Cathedral. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the cathedral grounds. Young's poetry and his essays place him in the highest class of writers about the countryside, but few such writers display affection for the qualities of such very different landscapes as Andrew Young. It is perhaps to his disadvantage that he was strictly neither a Scottish nor an English author, but he was British in a sense that few are. His daughter Alison and son-in-law Edward Lowbury wrote an affectionate and authoritative critical biography, <span class="italic">To Shirk No Idleness</span>, published in 1997. Memorial plaques were unveiled at the parish church in Stonegate and, on 1 October 1981, on the site of his birthplace in Elgin.<br>
