<span class="headword">Hawkins,  Laetitia-Matilda</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London and baptized on 8 August 1759, the second of three children and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12674/', "Sir John Hawkins (d. 1789)")</script>, attorney, musicologist, and biographer whom Samuel Johnson famously called &#145;unclub[b]able&#146;  (Hill, 2.297&#150;8), and his wife, Sidney Storer (<i>d</i>. 1793), whose inheritance (added to her original dowry) enabled the family in 1760 to acquire a fine house in Twickenham.<br>
<br>Hawkins's first novel was published before 1780 by Thomas Hookham after rejection by Thomas Cadell. Written to raise money for &#145;a whim of girlish patronage&#146;  (Hawkins, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 2.156), it brought in twice as much as was needed. The work is now unidentified, as are &#145;many subsequent volumes&#146; whose production she was too ashamed to mention.<br>
<br>After the deaths of her father and mother in 1789 and 1793 respectively, Hawkins remained at Twickenham, living with her scholarly brother Henry and a friend, Margaret Mitchell. In 1793 she replied to the politically radical <span class="italic">Letters from France</span> of Helen Maria Williams with <span class="italic">Letters on the Female Mind, its Powers and Pursuits</span>. After maintaining that with few exceptions &#145;the feminine intellect has less strength but more acuteness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.2), she argued the Christian anti-revolutionary case.<br>
<br>Hitherto anonymous (&#145;I chuse to be concealed&#146;; Hawkins, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.2), Hawkins set her name in 1806 to her translation from German of Johann Martin Miller's <span class="italic">Siegwart</span> and then, &#145;with the utmost repugnance&#146;, to <span class="italic">The Countess and Gertrude, or, Modes of Discipline</span>  (1811, xxix). Hawkins is a busy authorial presence in this <i>Bildungsroman</i>, which she dedicated to Henrietta Maria Bowdler, not for her own writings but as friend and editor of the scholar Elizabeth Smith. The popularity of this novel has been linked to its didacticism; a second edition followed the next year. <span class="italic">Rosanne, or, A Father's Labour Lost</span> (1814), in which a daughter becomes her father's religious and moral salvation, and <span class="italic">Heraline, or, Opposite Proceedings</span> (1821) share many of its features: slightly heavy-handed authorial notes, careful attention to the influences which shape their heroines' moral and intellectual development, condemnation of various aspects of behaviour prescribed for women, and matter-of-fact presentation of libertinism in high life. Each is published by name and dedicated to a noblewoman. Jane Austen called <span class="italic">Rosaline</span> &#145;very good and clever, but tedious&#146;  (Austen, 289). The anonymous <span class="italic">Annaline, or, Motive-Hunting</span> (1824) is also ascribed to Hawkins.<br>
<br>Hawkins collaborated with her brother Henry on <span class="italic">Sermonets</span> (1814) &#145;Addressed to Those Who have not yet Acquired, or who may have lost, The Inclination to Apply the Power of Attention to Compositions of a Higher Kind&#146;. Her topics include female dress, female education, and &#145;the female Character of the present Age&#146;, which begins with the fact that Christ chose to confide in women. She compiled <span class="italic">Devotional Exercises</span> (1823) from an earlier book by Bishop Simon Patrick, and left to Margaret Mitchell a manuscript diary of travels round much of England and Wales between 1824 and 1827. Her <span class="italic">Anecdotes, Biographical Sketches, and Memoirs</span> (1822) and the more personal and autobiographical <span class="italic">Memoirs, Anecdotes, Facts and Opinions</span> (1824) are her best-known works; they were abridged and adapted by Francis Henry Skrine (1926) and D. H. Simpson (1978). Laetitia-Matilda Hawkins died on 22 November 1835 in Twickenham. She was unmarried.<br>
