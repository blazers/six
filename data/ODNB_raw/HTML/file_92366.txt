<span class="headword">Lagden, Sir  Godfrey Yeatman</span>  (1851&#150;1934), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born at Sherborne, Dorset, on 1 September 1851, the fourth son in the family of at least five sons and one daughter of Richard Dowse Lagden (1799/1800&#150;1882), a Church of England clergyman who became rector of Stock Gaylard, Dorset, and his wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis. He attended Sherborne School before completing his education at a proprietary school in Salisbury. He then joined the civil service as a clerk in the General Post Office from 1869 to 1877, during which period he also shone as a cricketer and rugby player.<br>
<br>In 1877 Lagden decided to try his luck in South Africa, where, after the discovery of diamonds, the economy was flourishing. He disembarked at Cape Town, armed with a letter of introduction from his maternal grandfather, named Yeatman, a resident of Sherborne. Sir Bartle Frere, the high commissioner of South Africa and governor of Cape Colony, suggested that he proceed to Pretoria, where Sir Theophilus Shepstone had recently annexed the Transvaal on behalf of Britain, and was setting up his administration. In 1878 Lagden was appointed as a government clerk in the colonial secretary's office in Pretoria, where he met Marshal Clarke, Shepstone's native commissioner for the Lydenburg district, and the novelist Rider Haggard, the registrar of the high court in Transvaal. The three young men, all of a similarly adventurous turn of mind, enjoyed frequent hunting trips together in the Transvaal bushveld to the north of the capital.<br>
<br>(William) Owen Lanyon, Shepstone's replacement as administrator of the Transvaal in 1879, recognized Lagden's potential, appointing him as his private secretary. Lagden thus gained first-hand experience of colonial administration, and often discussed &#145;native affairs&#146; with Marshal Clarke and his superior, Henrique Shepstone, the secretary of native affairs for the Transvaal, who applied his more famous father's brainchild, the Natal &#145;Shepstonian&#146; system, to his administration of the indigenous people of the Transvaal. Influenced by Clarke and the Shepstones, Lagden duly &#145;became a great proponent of traditional and tried [&#147;native&#148;] policies&#146;  (Burton, 34).<br>
<br>Lanyon and Lagden were among those besieged in Pretoria during the Anglo-Transvaal War of 1880&#150;81. They bemoaned the home government's decision, after the defeat of imperial troops at Majuba Hill (and the death in combat of Sir George Pomeroy Colley) on 27 February 1881, that the Transvaal be returned to the Boers. While Lanyon was recalled to Britain to face censure for mishandling the &#145;disaffected Boers&#146; crisis, Lagden remained in Pretoria. After a brief spell working with Lanyon's replacement, he became private secretary to Sir Evelyn Wood and was involved in the post-war deliberations of the royal commission for the settlement of the Transvaal, and the subsequent compensation committee.<br>
<br>In 1882 Lagden returned to London, where the opportunity arose to go to Egypt as war correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, to cover the imperial campaign against the nationalist leader &#145;Urabi. On his return Lagden was offered a temporary appointment in Accra, which he reluctantly took up in 1883, insisting that he would rather return to South Africa. Ambitious and eager for promotion, he soon fell out with the governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Samuel Rowe. The dispute came to a head when Rowe informed Lagden that he was required to proceed immediately to a posting in Sierra Leone. Lagden maintained he was first entitled to take leave, but Rowe refused to sanction this, and Lagden countered by resigning and undertaking an expedition to Kumasi, in flagrant defiance of his superiors. When he returned to London he found that he had been struck off the <span class="italic">Colonial Office List</span>.<br>
<br>Fortuitously, Lagden's friend Marshal Clarke had just been appointed resident commissioner in Basutoland and had stipulated that he wished Lagden to be his secretary and accountant, a request which had already been approved by Sir Hercules Robinson, Frere's replacement as high commissioner of South Africa. Lagden joined up with Clarke, and arrived in Maseru in March 1884.<br>
<br>Apart from a short period in 1892 in Swaziland, where he served as acting British commissioner, Lagden worked in Basutoland until late 1900. During this seventeen-year period he gained a considerable reputation for implementing imperial policy in the region. He earned particular credit for his even-handed negotiations with Paramount Chief Letsie and other indigenous leaders. Once the co-operation of the Koena chiefs had been secured, Lagden followed the general principles of the Shepstonian system, allowing traditional leaders to retain, and even consolidate, their influence among their people. Another notable achievement was his handling of the rinderpest epizootic. On 2 August 1887 he married Frances Rebekah Bousfield, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31995/', "Henry Brougham Bousfield")</script>, the Anglican bishop of Pretoria; they had three sons (the eldest of whom was killed in action in 1915) and two daughters.<br>
<br>Appointed permanent resident commissioner of Basutoland in 1893, when Clarke was transferred to Zululand, Lagden acquitted himself well in the protracted struggle between the Basotho rivals Lerotholi and Moiketsi, eventually managing without recourse to the military to persuade Moiketsi to surrender and submit to trial. In 1897 Lagden was created KCMG.<br>
<br>When the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 broke out Lagden did all he could to uphold the neutrality of Basutoland and promote the imperial war effort. These actions, backed by his growing reputation as a &#145;native administrator&#146;, caught the attention of Alfred Milner, high commissioner of South Africa, who in 1901 appointed Lagden commissioner of native affairs in the Transvaal. In the post-war Transvaal, since 1900 under British control, Lagden made his mark in two crucial spheres closely linked to the well-being of the mining industry&#151;and thus the British administration of the area&#151;the regulation of African labour for the mines and the delineation of African locations. Milner saw Lagden as a significant player in his concerted &#145;reconstruction&#146; initiative in South Africa, which was aimed specifically at establishing &#145;a self-governing white community supported by well-treated and justly governed black labour&#146; (Milner, quoted in Beinart and Dubow, 46). A common &#145;native policy&#146; for all four colonies was thus a central issue in Britain's vision for South Africa. In 1903, with this in mind, Milner named Lagden as chairman of the South African Native Affairs Commission (SANAC).<br>
<br>The commission, composed largely of English-speakers, travelled extensively to gather evidence, and its report appeared in February 1905. Its recommendations included territorial segregation and a system of political separation, with separate voters' rolls and different constituencies for Africans and whites. Commentators judged it mundane and inconclusive, claiming that it reflected Lagden's distaste for innovation. With its emphasis on the need to proletarianize Africans for cheap labour in the mines, it embodied many features of the emerging policy of segregation, the forerunner of apartheid.<br>
<br>Lagden was never a popular official and became the butt of much criticism. He grew disenchanted with Milner and suffered bouts of debilitating depression, convinced that his endeavours were not appreciated by his superiors. Disillusioned and weary, in 1907 he opted for retirement when crown colony rule ended in the Transvaal. Back in England in 1908, he became the secretary and a member of the council (later vice-president) of the Royal Colonial Institute, serving on this body until 1923. His two-volume history of the Basotho people, <span class="italic">The Basutos: the Mountaineers and their Country</span>, based largely on parliamentary blue books, appeared in 1909 to a lukewarm reception. He was vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1927 he was created KBE. He died at his home, Selwyn, Oatlands Chase, Weybridge, Surrey, on 26 June 1934 and was buried at St Mary's, Oatlands.<br>
