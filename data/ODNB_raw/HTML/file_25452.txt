</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shore,  John</span>, first Baron Teignmouth  (1751&#150;1834), <span class="occ">governor-general of Bengal and founder and first president of the British and Foreign Bible Society</span>, was born on 8 October 1751 at St James Street, Piccadilly, where the family were living temporarily, and was baptized in St James's Church on 23 October. He was the elder of the two children of Thomas Shore (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1759), a supercargo in the East India Company trading to China, and his second wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1783), daughter of Captain Shepherd of the company's naval service. The family lived in Melton Place, near Romford in Essex, where John Shore attended school until he was seven, when he was sent to a school in Tottenham. At fifteen he went to Harrow School, where he developed a taste for the Latin and Greek classics which remained with him throughout his life. Nominated for a writership in Bengal by Frederick Pigou, a family friend who was a proprietor of the East India Company, he left Harrow for a commercial school at Hoxton to study bookkeeping and accounts, the formal requirement for appointment as a writer in the company's civil service.<h2>
<a name="Bengal17691785"></a>Bengal, 1769&#150;1785</h2>Shore sailed for Bengal late in 1768, arriving in May 1769. Appointed as a writer to the secret political department, in 1770 he was sent as assistant to the controlling council of revenue at Murshidabad, one of the two divisions for the collection of the revenue of the company's Bengal territories. Shore became, <i>de facto</i>, the company's chief agent in the vast district because his superiors were busy elsewhere on their own business or, as he reported to his mother, were indolent and indifferent to their responsibilities  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.28). During Shore's first year in Murshidabad, as the revenue system was breaking down under years of mismanagement and corruption by the company's and the nawab's local officials, an appalling famine, one of the worst in Indian history, devastated the area. The company's officials in the area were charged, in both India and England, with manipulating the food supply for their own profit, and Shore himself was accused of corruption, but after an investigation his name was cleared.<br>
<br>Shore's opportunity to show his ability came in 1772 with the changes instituted by Warren Hastings, the governor-general of Bengal. The directors in London had decided that the company should no longer try to manage the revenues through Indian intermediaries, but should take direct control, and Shore was posted to Rajshahi, one of the most important districts, as assistant to Samuel Middleton. He also had the temporary post as Persian translator at the nawab's court in Murshidabad. Although at first he had no grammars or dictionaries, he managed through oral instruction from local teachers to study Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, and Bengali, becoming one of the first of the company's servants to achieve reasonable literacy in Indian languages. He maintained his proficiency in Persian throughout his life.<br>
<br>Shore's growing reputation led to his appointment by Hastings in 1775 as one of five members to the provincial revenue council at Calcutta. This was the period of the great quarrels between Hastings and his leading councillor, Philip Francis, but, although Shore was known to share many of Francis's views, Hastings recognized his ability, and in 1780, when the revenue council was replaced by the committee of revenue, he was appointed to it, serving on it until he left India in 1785, and becoming its acting head. In addition, he was sent by Hastings to make revenue settlements in the districts of Patna and Dacca. In 1785 he summed up the committee's work, and indeed his view of the company's administration in general, when he wrote that the members were vested with vast power, but to pretend that they were able to carry out their duties responsibly would be &#145;folly and falsehood&#146;  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.73).<br>
<br>While an immense official correspondence bears witness to Shore's energy, hard work, and mastery of the intricacies of the Bengal revenue system, surviving letters to his mother and other friends in England give little indication of his private life. The company servants were still making fortunes through private trade, commissions on the revenue collections, and gifts from the nawab and his officials, but, as Shore complained to his mother, &#145;the road to opulence grows daily narrower, and is more crowded with competitors&#146;, restricted by stricter supervision in London. By 1781 he had acquired enough, however, through savings from his salary, trade, and investments, to offer his mother &pound;1000 a year, which she did not accept, and he spoke of his &#145;handsome emoluments&#146; from his position in the revenue departments as &#145;avowed, authorised, and liberal&#146;  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.79&#150;84).<br>
<br>Of the friends Shore made in Bengal, two were of particular importance to him. One was Sir William Jones, the great scholar who came out as judge of the supreme court. On Jones's death Shore succeeded him as president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and he later edited a collection of Jones's letters  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; William Jones</span>). The other was Charles Grant, who later became a dominant figure in the East India Company and the leading advocate for the evangelization of India, but at this time he was seeking spiritual advice from Shore, which led to his acceptance of Shore's evangelical Christianity. Shore's own religious attitude is summed up in a comment he made about his mother's religion as being, after the fashion of the time, a &#145;dwelling principally on the morality of the Gospel, and little on the fundamental doctrine of the Atonement&#146;  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.6). His private correspondence throughout his life would be permeated by his anxiety about sin and the need for salvation. He disliked India, partly because he was ill much of the time, perhaps from malaria, and he suffered so much from insomnia that he once said he had never slept more than two hours a night in India  (ibid., 1.112). But he also disliked its customs and especially its religion, while being critical of what he regarded as the licentious behaviour of many of the company's servants in his time. Light is perhaps cast on his personal sense of sin, especially sins of the flesh, by the comment that in his early years in Bengal he did not resist bad examples and &#145;lived as other young men did&#146;  (ibid., 1.26). Shore apparently had a mistress, presumably an Indian woman, for the records list the baptism of three illegitimate children of John Shore. John was baptized in October 1777, and Francis and Martha on 2 February 1785, but the mother's name is not given  (BL OIOC, N/1/2, fol. 285, and N/1/4, fol. 11). A letter in December 1783 from one of his friends in Bengal, G. G. Ducarel, to another, David Anderson, confirms this, noting that Shore had held positions in Bengal which &#145;a person with a less delicate Sense of Honour&#146; would have used to make a fortune, but as he thought of returning to England he had less than &pound;7000, and he had to provide for &#145;two natural Children at present in being and one more in expectation&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 45435, fol. 264). That these children are not mentioned by Shore's detractors, especially those who disliked his piety, suggests how commonplace this aspect of his behaviour was among the company's servants. He left Bengal in 1785, on the same ship as Warren Hastings, who impressed him with his friendliness and scholarly interests.<h2>
<a name="England17851786"></a>England, 1785&#150;1786</h2>Shore arrived in England in June and spent the first few months visiting friends. In November he met Charlotte Cornish (<i>d</i>. 1834) of Teignmouth, described as &#145;a young lady of great personal attractions&#146;, and they were married on 14 February 1786  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.117). The marriage appears to have been happy, despite their long separations when either his wife did not accompany him to India or had to return home because of illness. They eventually had nine children, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Shore thought in 1786 that he was through with India, but within two weeks he was asked to go back as a member of the supreme council of the new governor-general, Lord Cornwallis. Shore's appointment came from the dominant group within the company, who recognized that his experience and knowledge of the revenue system, and his reputation for integrity, would serve its interests, especially as Cornwallis had no knowledge of the subcontinent. Shore accepted the appointment, despite his dislike of India, as his marriage meant he needed more money. He sailed in April 1786, leaving his new wife behind.<h2>
<a name="Revenuereform"></a>Revenue reform</h2>As a member of the supreme council, Shore did not have specific duties, but Cornwallis relied on him in making the administrative and judicial changes that transformed the government of Bengal, especially in relation to the collection of revenue. While it is difficult to summarize Shore's intricate writings, especially as he was always arguing against other interpretations of the available data and changing his views as he gained new information, he asserted that the historical evidence showed that throughout Mughal times the <i>zamindars</i> were not just tax collectors, but had been the hereditary proprietors of the soil. Giving the company maximum revenue while providing stability for agriculture could only be done, he insisted, through standardized assessments with the <i>zamindars</i> as the acknowledged owners of the land. While he agreed that the fairest system would be to make a settlement directly with the peasants, he felt that the company had neither the knowledge nor the personnel to institute such a drastic change from the system they had found. A ten-year settlement, he was convinced, would give the <i>zamindars</i> an assurance of stability, and the government could get a clearer understanding of how the system worked. Against Shore's advocacy of a decennial settlement were those like the influential Thomas Law and James Grant who argued for a permanent settlement, which meant not only recognizing the <i>zamindars</i> as landlords, but guaranteeing that the revenue payment fixed at the beginning would be perpetual. Shore argued that not enough was known about the actual state of the economy to justify the British making a permanent revenue commitment that would prevent them from profiting from any increase in agricultural productivity. While acknowledging that Shore's knowledge of the Indian revenue systems was unmatched and that his reasoning on most points was persuasive, Cornwallis decided that a permanent settlement would best serve the needs of the British while making their subjects in Bengal &#145;the happiest people in India&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 1.460&#150;74, minute, 19 Feb 1790). Shore always remained doubtful about the wisdom of the decision.<h2>
<a name="England17901792"></a>England, 1790&#150;1792</h2>Shore left Bengal at the end of 1789, arriving back in England in April 1790 to be greeted by his wife and their first child, a daughter, Charlotte, whom he had not seen before. He estimated his income at this time at &pound;900 a year, from savings from his salary of &pound;10,000 a year while on the supreme council, and he once more expected to retire to reading the classics in Devonshire. In 1790 he gave evidence in Hastings's favour during his impeachment, insisting, based on his knowledge of the period, that Hastings was never personally corrupt, while, he wrote privately, of the two main accusers, Edmund Burke was mad and Philip Francis, once his friend, was &#145;malicious and revengeful&#146;  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.206). Then, to his surprise, he was asked to go back to India as governor-general, as Henry Dundas, the president of the Board of Control, the government's agency for influencing the East India Company, and Shore's friends among the directors of the company saw him as the best hope for continuing the reforms begun by Cornwallis. Shore, having been created a baronet, sailed for India on 26 October 1792, arriving in Calcutta in March 1793.<h2>
<a name="Governorgeneral17931798"></a>Governor-general, 1793&#150;1798</h2>Shore was in a somewhat awkward situation at first, as Cornwallis had stayed on in Bengal, expecting an outbreak of war with France, and Shore did not take office as governor-general until 28 October. Accounts of Shore's administration have compared him unfavourably with his famous predecessors, Clive and Hastings, and his successor, Lord Wellesley, citing his preoccupation with carrying out Cornwallis's planned judicial and revenue reforms, instead of seizing opportunities that might have brought more territory and more influence to the British. He was, however, following the explicit instructions of the company and of the British government not to intervene in the internal wars of India but to follow Cornwallis's administrative policies, which he had helped to shape. Not only the implementation of those policies, but to a considerable extent their codification, including the permanent settlement, which was finally accepted by the directors in 1793, were Shore's contribution to building a state in India with an organized bureaucracy carrying out defined legislative and judicial functions.<br>
<br>Shore's adherence to a policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other Indian states was tested in 1794, when the Marathas, with their headquarters at Poona, attacked the nizam of Hyderabad. The company had made a defensive treaty with both the nizam and the Marathas against Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the nizam claimed that the British, by the terms of the treaty, were obliged to defend him. Shore refused, explaining in one of his long memoranda that the treaty was only against a common enemy, and that, in any case, the nizam had provoked the Marathas, and that no British interests were at stake  (Malcolm, 1.xliv&#150;lxv). An annoying side issue was an attack made by Lord Hobart, the governor of Madras, on Shore in 1796 for not supporting him in his intervention in the affairs of the nawab of Arcot. Denouncing Shore in astonishingly vituperative terms, he demanded his recall, but Henry Dundas at the Board of Control replied that Shore had the confidence of both the company and the government as &#145;a most able and upright servant of the Public&#146;  (Furber, 186).<br>
<br>Serious criticism of Shore's policies surfaced in London, however, in regard to his handling of a threatened mutiny by the officers of the company's army in 1795&#150;6. Rumour that the London authorities intended to reform the company's army by increasing pay but doing away with corrupt and oppressive practices had alarmed the officers, and they talked of seizing the governor-general and his council. Shore urged caution in making changes that might inflame the officers further, and felt that the situation was so dangerous that he made concessions on pay and supplementary expenses to the officers. The directors, annoyed at what seemed to be his weakness, decided to recall him and asked Lord Cornwallis to go out to restore order in the army, but, as dispatches arrived from Calcutta in 1797, it became apparent that Shore's action had in fact succeeded in re-establishing the authority of the Bengal government. Cornwallis declined the appointment, and Shore stayed on  (Callahan, 198).<br>
<br>The non-interventionist policies, based on what Lord Hobart sneeringly called Shore's principle that &#145;What is morally wrong cannot be politically right&#146;  (Furber, 195), did not preclude direct action, however, when he thought British interests were threatened by the behaviour of the ruler of Oudh, who paid large subsidies to the company for the support of its troops. The death of the nawab, Asaf ud-Daula, in 1797 led to changed relations, for his adopted son, Wazir Ali, appeared to be making military preparations to assert his independence. In addition, Shore received reports that he was behaving in a licentious and degrading manner, that he was base-born, and that factional strife in the court at Lucknow would lead to anarchy in the state, not only depriving the company of the valuable subsidies but threatening the stability of the whole region. Shore went to Lucknow at the end of 1797, and quickly decided that Wazir Ali must be replaced with Saadat Ali, a half-brother of the former nawab, who was more amenable to British control. While he was still at Lucknow in 1798, Shore received word that Lord Mornington (later Marquess Wellesley) had been appointed to succeed him, and that the king had agreed to create Shore Baron Teignmouth in the Irish peerage.<br>
<br>Critics of Shore's non-interventionist policy in the internal affairs of the Indian states have seen in it proof of his lack of understanding of British destiny in India  (Lyall, 235), and this in a sense is true, for Shore had no vision of all the subcontinent permanently united in a British India, but only of the necessity for preserving Bengal for the East India Company and Great Britain. He was convinced, as he wrote in 1794, that the territories in India would not remain &#145;fifty years longer under our dominion&#146;  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 1.185). At the same time, during his term of office he had come to the conclusion that a great change had taken place in India since he had first arrived thirty years before. British power had become, as he put it, &#145;a Sovereignty&#146;, from having been &#145;a mere Dependency&#146;, but this fact had not been realized in England  (ibid., 1.328&#150;9).<h2>
<a name="PresidentoftheBritishandForeignBibleSociety17981834"></a>President of the British and Foreign Bible Society, 1798&#150;1834</h2>Despite thirty years of intense involvement in India, after his return to England in 1798 Shore seems to have lost interest in the affairs of the East India Company. Instead, as Lord Teignmouth, he settled in 1802 into the life of a country gentleman at Clapham, then a rural village outside London, acting as a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant of Surrey. He also began what amounted to a new career as the first president of the British and Foreign Bible Society, a position that he held until his death in 1834, and which he regarded as of more significance to his own life, and to the world at large, than his service in India. The Bible Society is not given much attention in the standard histories of the nineteenth century, but it was an important component of the evangelical movement in the Church of England that was claiming a new role for the Christian laity, especially among the upper classes, that was reshaping British society. From 1802 to 1808 his neighbours and close friends at Clapham were a group of evangelical Christians who became known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42140', "Clapham Sect")</script>, including William Wilberforce, Charles Grant, Henry Thornton, John Venn, and Zachary Macaulay. The anti-slavery campaign is the best known of their activities, but they regarded the Bible Society as fundamental to their work, along with closely related plans for missionary work throughout the world, but especially in India. Teignmouth wrote much of the annual reports of the Bible Society and he also engaged in long debates, through tracts and pamphlets, with its opponents. Some of these argued that the company had wisely forbidden missionaries to work in its territories, and that it was wrong for a former governor-general to use his prestige to encourage conversion to Christianity in India, where such activity would create hostility that might lead to the overthrow of British rule. Others attacked the society because it included nonconformist clergy in its membership and because it did not publish the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> along with the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Teignmouth answered these attacks in methodical detail.<br>
<br>In 1807 Teignmouth was appointed a member of the Indian Board of Control, and at the same time he was sworn of the privy council, occasionally hearing appeals relating to India. His authoritative knowledge of British rule in India led to his being called to give evidence, somewhat unwillingly, before committees of the House of Commons on 18 June 1806 and again on 30 March 1813, at a more important session, when the select committee was hearing evidence on the renewing of the company's charter, which he supported as necessary for maintaining British authority. Free trade would not lead, he insisted, to an increase in imports, as the Indian people neither wanted nor could afford British goods; but, reflecting a major concern of his Clapham friends, he saw no reason for continuing to restrict the entry of Christian missionaries to the company's territories, as there was no evidence that their work would antagonize the people of India.<br>
<br>The Teignmouths left Clapham in 1808, and moved to 4 Portman Square in London, to a house where they lived for the rest of their lives. His personal letters to his children and friends, as well as his articles for the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span> and other religious publications, are marked by a fervent and a pervasive piety, which was based, he said, on &#145;the doctrines of the Church of England, as those which were delivered by Christ to the Apostles&#146;. These were &#145;the inherent depravity of man&#146; and salvation by faith alone, to the exclusion of all merit from good works  (Shore, <span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Teignmouth</span>, 2.46&#150;7).<br>
<br>Teignmouth died at home in Portman Square on 14 February 1834, and was buried in the parish church of St Marylebone, where his wife, who died on 13 July 1834, was also buried. The monument in the church in their memory states that he was president of the Bible Society before noting that he was governor-general of Bengal. His eldest son, Charles John Shore, succeeded to the title.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Although Teignmouth's achievements as a revenue official are perhaps remembered only by specialists, all the public and private evidence suggests that he was greatly respected during his Indian career for his hard work, detailed knowledge of revenue systems, financial probity, and sense of justice. Lord Bexley, the son of a former governor of Bengal, Henry Vansittart, and Teignmouth's successor as president of the Bible Society, wrote of &#145;his dignified courtesy of manners&#146;, his &#145;great sagacity&#146;, and his &#145;utmost candour&#146;, and this is affirmed by many others  (&#145;Sketch&#146;, 274). There is, however, a very different judgement that needs to be noted, considering its source and its appearance in a well-known publication. Lord Wellesley, his successor as governor-general, declared that Teignmouth's &#145;low birth&#146;, added to &#145;indolence, timidity, and bad health&#146;, established &#145;a systematic degradation of the person, dignity, and authority of the Governor General&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). This can only be squared with the widespread judgement that he was a man of &#145;integrity, humanity, and honour&#146;  (Stephen, 277) by recognizing that Wellesley was writing from a new day of pomp and power, of which Teignmouth disapproved, but that, ironically, he had helped to make possible.<br>
