<span class="headword">Gamwell,  (Antonia) Marian</span>  (1891&#150;1977), <span class="occ">volunteer ambulance driver and commanding officer of the FANY</span>, was born on 28 July 1891 at 169 Knight's Hill Road, West Norwood, the eldest daughter of Frederick Robison Gamwell (1835&#150;1901), an East India merchant, and his wife, Marian Antonia Bankart (1864&#150;1922). Her sister <a name="cosubject_67669"></a><span class="headword">(Anne) Hope Gamwell</span>  (1893&#150;1974), who was also a senior member of the FANY during the Second World War, was born at Innisfail, 79 Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, on 15 May 1893.<br>
<br>Both the Gamwell sisters were educated at Roedean School. They had a very strict upbringing but they inherited a sense of adventure from their mother, a qualified nurse, who was always encouraging the girls to go ahead and do things. Mrs Gamwell was one of the first people in England to own a car and the two girls learned to drive about the age of fifteen. Marian and Hope used to spend hours stripping the engine to repair faults and putting it together again. In these early years they wore their hair in thick, long plaits, but later, in 1914, had it cropped in the style which remained a characteristic of the two sisters for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>During her youth Marian developed an interest in farming and when she left school in 1910 she sought to study agriculture. However, none of the agricultural colleges would accept a woman as a student. Instead, she went to work on poultry and dairy farms in Gloucestershire and Berkshire and eventually travelled to Saskatchewan in Canada where she worked on a dairy-cum-wheat farm. She sailed home about December 1912 on the British liner <i>Lusitania</i> (sunk in 1915).<br>
<br>By this time Marian's mother had moved to Llanbedr, Merioneth, and was living in a country house called Aber Artro, which during the First World War became a British Red Cross auxiliary hospital. After the war broke out in 1914, Mrs Gamwell took her two daughters to France at the suggestion of Dr Elsie Inglis, who founded the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, to prepare a hospital for the French army at the Abbaye de Royaumont, near Viarmes, 30 miles from Paris. Marian described the old abbey, which had been used as stables, as filthy  (Gamwell and Albrecht). They set about cleaning it and while Marian drove ambulances Hope worked in the X-ray room. They worked there until May 1915 when the two sisters went to Calais where they joined the FANY, which had been founded in 1907 as a corps of nurses on horseback &#145;tending Britain's soldiers on the field&#146;  (Terry, 25). Their mother returned to north Wales.<br>
<br>Marian and Hope were set to work at the first FANY hospital, Lamarck, which had 100 beds and was housed in a convent school in the rue de la Rivi&egrave;re, Calais. Their patients consisted mainly of cases of typhoid which was then raging in the Belgian army. Thanks to the generosity of their mother the sisters were able to provide an ambulance and a mobile bath for Lamarck transport. The mobile bath was an enormous Daimler car fitted with six canvas baths on each side. Water was heated by Primus stoves inside the body of the car. It gave 250 baths a day and disinfected the men's clothes  (Ward, 47).<br>
<br>On 1 January 1916 the Calais convoy came into being to relieve the men ambulance drivers and for the first time women were officially driving ambulances for the British army. Thus the FANYs became the guinea pigs for women at war. Their vehicles were ill-equipped for the weather and the conditions. They had rudimentary windscreens, inefficient springs, unreliable engines, no self-starters, and tyres which punctured easily. The women drivers had to maintain the vehicles and during the winter months they had to crank the engines at hourly intervals to warm them up. On Good Friday 1916 Marian broke an arm when the engine backfired and the starting-handle smashed into her right arm.<br>
<br>In April 1918 Marian, suffering from appendicitis, returned to England leaving Hope to take over her task as sergeant responsible for stores for the servicing of the vehicle fleet. She spent the rest of the war working for Rolls-Royce as a member of the aircraft inspection department.<br>
<br>After the war Hope returned to England in 1919 to become a member of the newly formed FANY headquarters staff committee and played a decisive part in the development of the corps. Marian, while retaining membership of FANY, spent some time in Greece. Apart from their many other pursuits, the two sisters were keen sailors and found time to cruise from Bangor in Marian's yawl, <i>Boudja</i>. They sold the house in Wales after their mother's death and went to Africa to prospect for land on which to farm. On 6 November 1928 they set off from Nairobi in a Rugby car to drive across Kenya and Tanganyika (Tanzania). The roads in Africa at that time consisted mainly of cattle tracks, and bridges across the streams and rivers were rudimentary. However, the intrepid Gamwell sisters allowed nothing to impede their progress and they arrived at Abercorn (now called Mlala) in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) on 19 December 1928. Here they acquired what Marian called &#145;a plot of land&#146;  (Gamwell and Albrecht) consisting of 999 acres at the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika which they called Chilongolwelo.<br>
<br>The two sisters with their team of workers hacked a farm out of the virgin Rhodesian bush, built their home, and planted coffee. They had to battle against predators, locusts, tsetse flies, and malaria. During trips to England, Marian and Hope trained as pilots at the London Aeroplane Club at Hanworth. Marian says in her manuscript autobiography that she was the first woman to drive a motor car in Dresden, the first to ride a motor bicycle in Athens, and the first to cycle in Majorca.<br>
<br>When they were ready for the first picking of coffee, the Second World War broke out and the FANYs sent an urgent request to the Gamwell sisters to return. Hope flew home immediately while Marian set about burning the crop because it was against the law to leave the coffee untended. When Marian returned to London in 1940 she found herself embroiled in a battle to maintain the autonomy of the FANYs against the formidable opposition of Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, director of the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Part of the FANYs formed the basis of the driver training centre at Camberley under Mary Baxter-Ellis while the Gamwell sisters, referred to by a certain brigadier as &#145;the thick one [Hope] and the thin one [Marian]&#146;  (Popham, 134), took over the running of the corps unit. Marian became commandant of the independent FANYs and Hope went to Scotland to command the corps unit attached to the Polish forces before returning to London to recruit for the special operations executive (SOE), which infiltrated agents into occupied territory in Europe. This, according to Marian  (Gamwell and Albrecht), was undoubtedly the most important work that the FANYs undertook during the war. In April 1942 the first women to join SOE as agents were selected and sent for training. By 1944 just over fifty had been sent into France, thirty-nine of them FANYs, or members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force who became FANYs on recruitment to SOE. Of these thirty-nine, thirteen died in concentration camps. Three of these women agents were awarded the George Cross, two posthumously. Some 2000 other FANYs provided the backbone of SOE, working with ciphers and signals, as agent-conducting officers, and administering the special training schools. In all the FANYs served in forty-four countries with Hope playing a prominent part in the organization of SOE in Egypt and Italy  (<span class="italic">FANY Gazette</span>, 18).<br>
<br>During the war both Marian and Hope travelled extensively visiting FANY outposts abroad. An illustration of Marian's spirit of adventure is the story of one of her wartime trips when, needing to get to Baghdad, with no other form of transport available from Cairo, she seriously suggested that she might take a camel  (Popham, 134). Marian became an OBE in the 1946 new year's honours and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Hope Gamwell returned to their Abercorn farm in December 1945 and Marian followed in June 1946. Instead of coffee they embarked on growing rice, wheat, and millet and Marian took up bee-keeping. They remained on their farm until October 1964 when Marian, aged seventy-three, and Hope, aged seventy-one, returned to the United Kingdom to live in Jersey.<br>
<br>While Hope was shy, reserved, and self-effacing, Marian was the born leader, a competent administrator, a strategist, a builder who never shirked responsibility. Both sisters were tall with a martial bearing, emphasized by their crisp, no-nonsense manner, their cropped hair, and the khaki drill they wore which became almost a Gamwell trade mark. Dr F. O. Albrecht in a foreword to Marian's autobiography says they formed a perfect team working in a kind of symbiotic unity, each knowing the other's mind without actually saying a word  (Gamwell and Albrecht, iii). The contribution of the two sisters was immense and stories of their wartime experiences are an integral part of FANY lore. Both died in Jersey, Hope on 25 April 1974 and Marian on 13 May 1977.<br>
