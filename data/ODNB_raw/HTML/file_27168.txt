<span class="headword">Theobald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1090&#150;1161), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born at Thierville (Eure) in Normandy, some 5 kilometres north of the abbey of Le Bec-Hellouin, in the valley of the Risle and within the lordship of Brionne.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlymonasticcareer"></a>Family and early monastic career</h2>Theobald's father was reputed to have been a knight, presumably in the service of the count; and, accordingly, was of a similar social standing to Herluin, the founder of Bec. The author of a brief life of Theobald, perhaps Miles Crispin, the precentor of Bec who died about 1150, considered his lineage distinguished, but does not name his parents. Robert de Torigni describes Theobald as noble and honourable. Theobald's father was a neighbour, and perhaps a kinsman, of Gilbert Beket, the father of Theobald's successor at Canterbury. He had several children. One of the younger sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50342/', "Walter")</script>, was made by Theobald his second-in-command at Canterbury. Four of Theobald's nephews, Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger, and Lechard, together with their tutor, the clerk Thomas d'&Eacute;vreux, witness a charter of his from 1150&#150;53. The first of these, named as Guillaume de Thierville, is found as a clerk in Bishop Bartholomew of Exeter's household about 1172.<br>
<br>A date for Theobald's birth about 1090, when Robert Curthose was duke of Normandy, would suit the information that he was very old when he died and also produce a likely chronology. The author of his life states that he was very well educated in the liberal arts, but does not claim him as an alumnus of the abbey. He entered the monastery of Bec when the noble Guillaume de Montfort of Montfort-sur-Risle was abbot (1093&#150;1124), the 266th of his 346 admissions, and so, perhaps, about 1117, when he would be about twenty-seven. The biographer adds that Theobald spent many years as a claustral monk, ten years as prior, and was elected abbot on the death of Boso in June 1136. But he obtained the office only with difficulty. Archbishop Hugh of Rouen first withheld consent because he had not been consulted, then the benediction because Theobald, like his predecessors, would not make a profession of canonical obedience. In the end Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, who was on a visit to Normandy, secured a compromise, a verbal profession. According to the life, the archbishop thereafter loved him dearly. But it seems as though the abbey, perhaps because Theobald soon deserted it, was not so indulgent.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>William de Corbeil, archbishop of Canterbury, died on 21 November 1136, at a time when King Stephen's authority was crumbling in both England and Normandy under attacks from Scotland and Anjou and internal rebels, mostly in support of his rival to the throne, Henry I's daughter, the empress Matilda, widow of the emperor Heinrich V and the wife of Geoffrey, count of Anjou. By November 1138, however, Stephen had weathered the storm and could spare time for Canterbury. His younger brother, Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester, who was administering the vacant diocese and coveted the arch-see, had been negotiating with Pope Innocent II for permission to be translated. In June 1138 a papal legate, Alberic, cardinal-bishop of Ostia, arrived in England; and after a visitation of the dioceses he summoned a general council to Westminster for 11 December. In his mandate to the diocese of Canterbury he listed the appointment of a new archbishop among the business to be transacted. He recognized the right of the monks to elect, but also mentioned the interest of the bishops and the king in the matter.<br>
<br>Stephen had in fact clearly decided to thwart his brother's vaulting ambition; and with the pope's and the legate's connivance&#151;and, presumably, the support of some of the leading bishops&#151;staged a <i>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>. Theobald went to London on the invitation of the king and queen; and at the very end of the council, on 24 December, when Henry of Winchester had absented himself for some business at St Paul's, Theobald was elected archbishop. The procedure is variously described and the parts played by the several constituent actors are uncertain. But there seems to have been no overt opposition to the abbot's election. It could be that Theobald's relative obscurity served him well. On 8 January 1139 the legate, assisted by most of the provincial bishops, consecrated him archbishop at Canterbury. Meanwhile the pope had summoned the English prelates to a general council (the Second Lateran Council) to be held at Rome in Lent; and Theobald set off with four of his suffragans and four abbots. Before August he returned with a pallium. But Innocent had found a novel way of checking Canterbury's pretensions to a primacy: on 1 March he named Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester, his standing legate in the kingdom. He was also offering an olive branch. But Henry never forgave his brother for his treachery; and his ambition to create a third ecclesiastical province in England, based on Winchester, became an additional threat to Theobald.<h2>
<a name="Householdgovernment"></a>Household government</h2>Theobald was not only an ambitious man but also a brave one. The almost inevitable civil war in England and Normandy, which was about to begin, ensured a tense political situation and an insoluble problem of loyalty. Henry of Winchester's legation (1139&#150;43) and ambitions were a recipe for a similar anarchy in the English church. And the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, who had been feuding with William de Corbeil over how the collegiate church of St Martin at Dover should be reformed, and continued to behave unlawfully in the two years' vacancy after his death, offered an immediate challenge to Theobald's authority. Although the incomer was, like his illustrious predecessors, Lanfranc and Anselm, a monk of Bec, he was also a man of a new age. He appointed his brother Walter as archdeacon of Canterbury at the earliest opportunity, brought over his nephews (<i>nipoti</i>), and recruited a household of clerks, which, distinguished though it might be, was not the traditional family of a monk-bishop. Indeed, its brilliance must have been an unexpected outcome of the arrival of a hitherto obscure abbot. Among the stars of this alma mater of three future archbishops and six bishops were Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, Thomas Becket of London, John of Canterbury (later archbishop of Lyons), Bartholomew, the future bishop of Exeter, William of Northolt, John of Pagham, and William de Vere. Most of these were masters of arts; by 1145 Theobald had also attracted the Italian master of laws, Vacarius, and by 1147&#150;8 John of Salisbury, both in their different disciplines scholars and figures of European importance.<br>
<br>Although the purpose of the household was utilitarian&#151;to protect and exercise Theobald's rights as an ordinary, metropolitan, primate, landowner, and first minister of the king&#151;and was not intended to form a public school, it soon became, backed by Canterbury's fine library, one of the most distinguished academies that the English church ever produced. Several of its members remembered fondly the idyllic days they had passed there. It was a stimulating and also a competitive society. The archbishop worked hard to advance his clerks; and he had his favourites. When he promoted his brother Walter from the archdeaconry to the suffragan see of Rochester early in 1148, he gave Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que the vacant office. And, probably in 1152, he and some of Roger's friends, led by Thomas Becket, smothered a serious homosexual scandal in which the archdeacon was involved. In 1154 Theobald obtained for Roger a great prize, the archbishopric of York. After that Theobald doted on Becket, while John of Salisbury became his devoted confidential secretary.<h2>
<a name="ThemonksofCanterbury"></a>The monks of Canterbury</h2>There is every reason to think that Theobald's administration was efficient and progressive. With one of the greatest stylists of the age, John of Salisbury, drafting his diplomatic and legal correspondence, and humbler chancellors and scribes producing his charters, the literary and business documents produced were much influenced by the practices of the papal curia and the English royal court. Moreover, this household of bright young men was in general out of sympathy with &#145;musty&#146; monastic culture; and its recruitment indicates how the once insubordinate abbot was changing into an authoritarian bishop. Theobald took a sincerely benevolent interest in all monastic and canonical communities within his diocese and province; but he opposed their exemption from episcopal control and deplored, and sometimes withstood, even disregarded, the growing habit of &#145;undisciplined&#146; monks appealing to the pope against episcopal authority. The prior of the cathedral chapter, Christ Church, in 1138 was Jeremiah, who, as sub-prior, had been a thorn in William de Corbeil's flesh, and had been promoted illegally <i>sede vacante</i>. Theobald, at first impressed by this firebrand, allowed the monks to recolonize St Martin's, Dover, and used Jeremiah as his agent in the reform of the diocese. But by 1143 he had had enough, deposed him, and, although forced to reinstate him by Innocent II and his legate, Henry of Winchester, made life so uncomfortable for him that, with the solace of 100 marks to acquit the debts he had incurred by his appeal, Jeremiah resigned and retired to St Augustine's. When his replacement, Walter Durdent, a pious and learned monk, was elected bishop of Coventry in 1149, Theobald made a bad mistake by promoting his chaplain, Walter Parvus, to be prior of Christ Church. This man's mismanagement created so much havoc that Theobald, the son of a knight, had to use military force to restore order. He captured and imprisoned monks engaged in appealing to Rome, confiscated the priory's archives, and in 1152 arrested Walter at Lambeth and had him imprisoned at Gloucester. In his place he promoted the sub-prior Wibert, with whom he collaborated in reforming the chapter's administration.<br>
<br>As Theobald was abbot of Christ Church, he suffered few restraints on his inherent authority. St Augustine's, however, was far from domestic. Dedicated to the apostle of the English and the founder of the see, the burial place of the saint and of the first ten archbishops, it was not only the standing rival of Christ Church, but also claimed total exemption from the archbishop's jurisdiction. It had, moreover, in 1120 and 1139 obtained papal confirmation of its portfolio of forged papal bulls granting it independence and much besides. It was only with difficulty that William de Corbeil had obtained a profession of obedience from Hugh of Trottiscliffe, elected abbot in 1126; and a rebel group of monks, led by Hugh's nephew, the sacrist, William&#151;William the Devil to Christ Church monks&#151;and supported by the prior, Silvester, quarrelled with Theobald over a number of matters, mainly financial and administrative.<br>
<br>In 1144 Pope Lucius II decided most of the points at issue in the archbishop's favour. And in September 1149, when the prior and sacrist refused to observe the interdict placed on England by Eugenius III and Theobald, the archbishop, supported by the pope, excommunicated the two by name and had them publicly flogged at the door of Northfleet church before releasing them from his sentence. When Abbot Hugh died in 1151, Silvester, who paid the king 500 marks for custody of the abbey and a free election, secured the promotion and was succeeded as prior by William. Theobald, alleging simony, naturally withheld confirmation and benediction for as long as possible from his old enemy. But on 28 August 1152 he bowed to Eugenius's mandate, and, while reserving his rights, blessed Silvester without receiving a profession. But he did not let go. At Henry II's great council on 17 July 1157 at Northampton, Theobald proved that Abbot Hugh had made a profession to William de Corbeil. Whereupon Silvester, in the presence of six bishops, submitted.<h2>
<a name="Metropolitanandlegate"></a>Metropolitan and legate</h2>Theobald had restored order to his own see, city, and diocese. In his province, however, his metropolitan rights were at first largely nullified by Henry of Winchester's legation. Until the end of 1143 Theobald had to accept second place in the English church, and, although both he and Henry were monks, and had a common belief in the freedom of the church, their individual interests were often in conflict. Theobald's subordination did, however, shield him from having to take a leading part in dealing with Stephen's arrest of Roger, bishop of Salisbury, and the latter's episcopal kin in June 1139, and in contesting the king's traditional interference in the appointment to bishoprics and abbeys. The efforts made by Stephen and Henry to appoint first their nephew Waldef, and then William fitz Herbert (consecrated by Henry at Winchester in 1143), to the see of York, in the latter case provoking bitter opposition from the Cistercian order and its candidate, Henry Murdac, and extending the disorder in the church, also spared Theobald a powerful rival in the north.<br>
<br>After his legation lapsed on the death of Innocent II on 24 September 1143, Henry failed to get its renewal from Celestine II or his three successors, who employed legates <i>a latere</i>; nor could Theobald, despite repeated attempts, obtain one until Eugenius III rewarded him for his loyalty early in 1150. To judge by the terms of its renewal by Adrian IV in 1155, Theobald, on account of his prudence, steadfastness, probity, knowledge, and virtue, was granted a delegation of papal powers throughout the kingdom, including the right to convene councils, and, should he think fit, correct all errors and make ordinances. Theobald wasted no time. In March 1151 he held a legatine council in London, attended by the king, his eldest son, Eustace, and the nobility, which promulgated eight canons condemning the present ills in the kingdom, in particular, attacks on church property and illegal imposts on the clergy. The guilty were to be punished by anathema.<br>
<br>Until his own legation lapsed with the death of Adrian IV on 1 September 1159 and the subsequent papal schism, Theobald rebuilt and defended his metropolitan authority, even if only with powers delegated from Rome. He defeated, aided by some luck, Henry of Winchester's attempt to compensate for his lost legation by creating a province of &#145;western England&#146;, with Winchester as his metropolitan see. Eugenius III disliked Henry and favoured Theobald. The archbishop also successfully withstood the attempts of the Welsh bishops, led by Bernard of St David's, to create an independent province. Bernard's successor, David fitz Gerald, in 1148, at the start of his long tenure of the see, made an elaborate profession of obedience to Canterbury. Ireland, however, was removed from Canterbury's sphere of influence. Theobald consecrated Patrick to Limerick in 1140. But in 1152 the papal legate, Giovanni Paparo, completed the reform of the Irish church into four provinces, with the primacy going to Armagh.<br>
<br>As for Canterbury's primacy within Britain, in 1143&#150;4 Theobald, during a visit to Pope Celestine II, obtained with the help of the papal chancellor, the Englishman Robert Pullen, some sort of a confirmation, although in 1148 at Rheims, Eugenius III indicated that it did not cover York. Uncertainty over its extent is shown between 1143 and 1155 by Theobald's secretariat's styling the archbishop, seemingly indifferently, &#145;primate of the whole of Britain&#146;, &#145;primate of the whole of England&#146;, &#145;primate of England&#146;, and &#145;primate of the English&#146;. And in 1154, on the death of Archbishop William of York, Theobald, presumably acting as papal legate, consecrated his archdeacon, Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, to the see without requiring a written profession. This evasion ensured that he and Roger remained on good terms.<h2>
<a name="Copingwithcivilwar"></a>Coping with civil war</h2>Theobald was no less successful in his dealings with the English rulers and the civil war. The attempts made first by Henry I's daughter, Matilda, and her husband, and then by their son, Henry, to drive Stephen out of Normandy and England, which began seriously in 1139, caused problems for the nobles and prelates in both dominions. On his election to Canterbury in 1138 Theobald had done homage and sworn fealty to Stephen, who had been crowned by his predecessor in 1135. The church, hostile to hereditary claims in its own polity, usually accepted <i>de facto</i> kings, and judged all types of ruler according to how they treated ecclesiastical rights. But it may be presumed that the church had a prejudice against female rulers, especially if, as with the empress, they were imperious. Theobald as a pure Norman was committed to the continuing unity of the duchy and kingdom, but would have regarded the Angevins as hereditary enemies. Basically, however, the church was self-interested and opportunistic. Hence, although Theobald was sensible of a primary allegiance to Stephen, whom he knew the papacy had recognized, he did not consider that those factors overrode all other considerations, or that they extended to Stephen's sons.<br>
<br>A month after Stephen was captured by Matilda's supporters at Lincoln on 2 February 1141, Henry of Winchester recognized the empress as his lady, and swore fealty conditional on her acceptance of him as her principal adviser. Theobald, however, more principled&#151;as even William of Malmesbury acknowledged&#151;insisted that he must first obtain Stephen's permission; and, when he visited him in his prison at Bristol, Stephen allowed him to bow to necessity. In the next six months the archbishop was regularly, but probably not constantly, in Matilda's company. He was there on midsummer day, when the Londoners ejected her and her entourage from the city before she could be crowned. He remained after the legate had changed sides and adhered to Stephen's queen. And he was with her in September when she attacked Henry in Winchester and was then herself beset by the queen and her troops. Theobald, like Matilda, escaped only with difficulty, and suffered the indignity of being manhandled and robbed, while Earl Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and the real leader of her party, was captured by the royalists. Whereupon, both Henry of Winchester and Theobald started the negotiations that led in November to the exchange of Stephen for Robert. Theobald was at the legatine council at Westminster on 7 December when Stephen was reinstated. And at Christmas he crowned Stephen and the queen at Canterbury. The civil war continued until 1149; but after Matilda returned to Normandy in 1148, never to return, the fighting and disorder gradually subsided.<h2>
<a name="TheendofStephensreignandaccessionofHenryII"></a>The end of Stephen's reign and accession of Henry II</h2>Stephen, a kindly man, apparently showed no resentment for Theobald's temporary apostasy: he had yielded to <i>force majeure</i> in the interests of the church; and Theobald accepted that Stephen was the legitimate monarch with the traditional rights in the English church. The archbishop's frequent meetings with the popes, together with the proliferation of appeals from English ecclesiastical courts to the papal curia, did, however, make the papacy for a time the effective head of the English church. This was, inevitably, unwelcome to Stephen, and made life difficult for Theobald. When the king refused to allow the archbishop to attend Eugenius's general council at Rheims on 21 March 1148 and sent three &#145;safe&#146; bishops instead, Theobald&#151;making his way there by swimming rather than sailing, as the admiring pope exclaimed&#151;was punished for his defiance by the confiscation of his temporalities. In return, Eugenius suspended all those English prelates who had not attended, and, except for Henry of Winchester, delegated their absolution to Theobald. Moreover, at the end of the council the pope was about to excommunicate Stephen when Theobald begged for him to be spared.<br>
<br>In April 1148 the archbishop returned to England, was expelled by the king, and sojourned in Flanders. There he added to his offences by consecrating at St Omer his friend, Gilbert Foliot, abbot of Gloucester, to the bishopric of Hereford after securing the consent of Geoffrey, count of Anjou, whose adherents were in control of those parts. Eugenius supported Theobald by putting an interdict on England, and the archbishop, never daunted, returned again to the kingdom and was reconciled to the king. Gilbert Foliot, on Theobald's instruction, then swore fealty to Stephen. Adroitness was almost becoming double-dealing. In 1150 Theobald was rewarded with a papal legation.<br>
<br>By this time Stephen, in imitation of the Capetians in France, wanted to have his elder son, Eustace, crowned king and thus have the dynasty confirmed. He met, however, with determined opposition from Eugenius and Theobald, who, while remaining outwardly correct, had become sympathetic to the Angevin cause, and, while waiting on events, insisted on the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>. Theobald refused Stephen's demand at the Council of London in April 1152 for the coronation, escaped again to Flanders when threatened with violence by royalists, but made his peace with the king in August. In January 1153 Henry, Matilda's and Geoffrey's son, by then duke of Normandy and, in the right of his wife, duke of Aquitaine, invaded England; and the death first of the queen and then of Eustace robbed Stephen of the will to continue the struggle. It had become obvious to most involved that some settlement would have to be made. Theobald and his clerks were active in the negotiations that led at Winchester on 6 November to Stephen's recognition of Henry as his associate ruler and heir. Stephen died on 25 October 1154 while Henry was abroad. The church and the barons respected the treaty, and on 19 December Theobald crowned Henry king.<br>
<br>The old archbishop of Canterbury was accepted and at first honoured by the new young king. Theobald baptized his second son, Henry, born on 28 February 1155. But his attempt to repeat the success he had had in the church, when he contrived the election of his archdeacon to the archbishopric of York on 28 February 1154, by procuring for his next archdeacon, Thomas Becket, the royal chancellorship in January 1155, was less rewarding. Becket had acquired a grander master and eagerly entered a new world, and if Theobald had hoped to use him as a means of exerting influence within the king's government, he was to be disappointed. Nevertheless, relations between the old primate (whose health was beginning to fail, causing him to be increasingly reliant on John of Salisbury for the conducting of routine business) and the new king were generally good. Occasional friction, arising from the two men's concern to protect their respective interests, was offset by a matching willingness to minimize differences.<h2>
<a name="Lastdaysdeathandachievement"></a>Last days, death, and achievement</h2>Although Theobald was in poor health when Pope Adrian IV died on 1 September 1159, he took an active part in the recognition of Alexander III by the kings of France and England in the schism that followed. To his Council of London in June 1160, which considered the matter and advised the king, he was carried in a litter. His last days were clouded by the failure of both the king and his chancellor, who were together in Normandy, to visit him. And he complained bitterly of his former clerk's ingratitude. He died in his palace at Canterbury on 18 April 1161, comforted by John of Salisbury, and was buried shortly afterwards in his cathedral in the chapel of the Holy Trinity, behind the altar on the north side, with Archbishop Lanfranc's tomb on the south. While the cathedral was being repaired in 1180, after the great fire of 1174, Theobald's tomb was discovered and opened. Although a little shrunken, the archbishop's body was intact and rigid, so that some people hailed him as a saint. He was reburied in a lead chest in the nave before the altar of St Mary, and the old marble tomb was replaced above him.<br>
<br>For a tyro Norman abbot of relatively humble background, with, apparently, no experience of English conditions and without influential patrons, whether ecclesiastical or secular, Theobald's achievements are remarkable. Once he had escaped from the authority of Henry of Winchester, he led the English church adroitly through a most difficult period while defending Canterbury resourcefully against all its rivals. He provided a nursery for the church's future leaders; and he also worked consistently to preserve the unity of the kingdom and to restore the Anglo-Norman empire. Despite these successes, his character remains elusive. Gervase, with his treatment of Christ Church priors in mind, calls him impetuous. Adventurous and resolute would be kinder. A scholar and a patron of scholars and able clerks, a friend of monks and religious communities, a brave and ambitious performer, yet flexible and skilful in avoiding danger, he had, perhaps, a set of qualities that did not make either for greatness or for popularity. But Henry of Huntingdon, a contemporary who had seen him in action, thought him, unlike his predecessor at Canterbury, entirely praiseworthy. Theobald's misfortune was to be overshadowed by the grandeur of his own creation, his successor, Thomas Becket.<br>
