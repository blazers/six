<span class="headword">Everard,  Mathias</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1857), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of Thomas Everard of Randilestown, co. Meath, and his wife and cousin, Barbara, daughter of O'Reilly of Ballinlough Castle and sister of Sir Henry Nugent. He was appointed ensign in the 2nd (or Queen's) regiment at Gibraltar on 28 September 1804, and became lieutenant on 21 March 1805. In December 1805 the company to which he belonged, with two others of his regiment and two of the 54th foot, were captured on their voyage home from Gibraltar by a French squadron under Admiral Guillaumet, bound for Mauritius. The troops were put on the frigate <i>La Volontaire</i> and carried about for three months, until <i>La Volontaire</i> went into Table Bay for water, ignorant of the recapture of the Cape by the British, and surrendered to the shore batteries. The troops were landed, and the companies of the Queen's did duty for some months at the Cape; those of the 54th, to which Everard appears to have been temporarily attached, were sent with reinforcements to the River Plate, and acted as mounted infantry with the force under Sir Samuel Auchmuty. Everard led the forlorn hope at the storming of Montevideo on 3 February 1807, when twenty-two out of thirty-two men with him were killed or wounded. For this he received a sword of honour from the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's and the freedom of the city of Dublin.<br>
<br>Everard was promoted, on 23 April 1807, to a company in the 2nd battalion, 14th foot, with which he served at Corunna and in the Walcheren expedition. During the latter he was thanked in general orders for his conduct at the siege of Flushing (12 August 1809), when the flank companies of the 14th, one of which he commanded, supported by the rest of the battalion, in conjunction with some of the German legion, stormed one of the enemy's batteries and effected a lodgement within musket-shot of the walls.<br>
<br>Everard was subsequently transferred to the 1st battalion of his regiment in India, and commanded it at the siege of Hathras in 1817. He commanded a flank battalion in the operations against the Pindaris in 1818&#150;19, was made regimental major on 10 July 1821, and commanded it at the storming of Bharatpur on 29 December 1825. The 14th headed one of the columns of assault at Bharatpur, and unsupported cleared the breach after the premature explosion of a mine and effected a junction with the other column led by the 59th foot&#151;the steadiness and discipline of these two regiments, according to Lord Combermere, &#145;deciding the fate of the day&#146;. Everard was made CB in 1826 and a brevet lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Everard became regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1831, and commanded the regiment for a period of sixteen years in the UK, the West Indies, and North America. He was made KH in 1831 and major-general on 11 November 1851, and received a distinguished service pension. Everard, who had succeeded his elder brother in the family estate, died at Southsea, unmarried, on 20 April 1857.<br>
