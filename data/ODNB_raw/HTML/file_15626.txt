<span class="headword">Kingston, Sir  Anthony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1508&#150;1556), <span class="occ">landowner and conspirator</span>, was the only son of Sir William Kingston (<i>d</i>. 1540) of Elmore and Painswick, Gloucestershire. Since he began to acquire stewardships and other minor offices in Gloucestershire in 1528, Anthony was probably born about 1508, or perhaps a little earlier. Nothing is known of his upbringing, but the conventional education of the son of a substantial gentleman and courtier can be assumed. His first significant preferment was as keeper of Berkeley Castle and steward of the lordship, in 1531, an appointment that must be attributable to his father's influence at court. He was also sheriff of Gloucestershire for the first time in 1533&#150;4, three years before he was appointed to the commission of the peace. In 1536 he secured the relatively minor court position of sergeant of the hawks, and by 1539 had been promoted to esquire of the body. Since the rise of the privy chamber this was no longer an influential position close to the king's person, but it indicated a promising career. He had accompanied the court to Calais as early as 1532, attended Prince Edward's baptism in 1537, and assisted at the reception of Anne of Cleves in 1540. Apart from his father's influence, part of the secret of his success seems to have been that he was a skilled jouster, a quality that always appealed to Henry, even after he had given up the lists himself. In 1536 he raised 100 of his own men against the Pilgrimage of Grace, and was placed in command of the whole Gloucestershire contingent, numbering about 1000. He is alleged to have been involved in a skirmish at Louth in October 1536, but there was no serious fighting, and this experience can hardly count as a campaign. He served in France in 1544, along with many other members of the royal household, but was in no sense a professional soldier.<br>
<br>Kingston was knighted on 2 May 1540, which was an acknowledgement of his service at court rather than in the field, and probably a recognition of his standing in Gloucestershire; he sat in the Commons for the county in 1539, 1542, and 1545. His father died on 14 September 1540, and Sir Anthony succeeded to his substantial estates. By 1546 he was <i>custos rotulorum</i> and thereafter he served on numerous local commissions, for musters, chantries, and church goods. He sympathized with the protestant policies adopted after 1547. In 1549 he served as provost marshal under Lord Russell in the suppression of the south-western rebellion, a position in which he behaved with considerable brutality, and in 1551 became a member of the council in the marches of Wales. He sat again in the Commons for Gloucestershire in 1547 and in March 1553. He received a number of minor grants of monastic land, and was sheriff for a second time in 1550&#150;51, and also a vice-admiral.<br>
<br>Kingston married twice. His first wife was Dorothy, the daughter of Robert Harpur. As he had married her before October 1524, this match had probably been arranged by his father to cement a connection with the Staffords, of whom Harpur had been a retainer. The marriage was not a success, and by 1533 Anthony was petitioning Cranmer to arrange a divorce. However, subjects did not have the benefit of the king's options, and he was unsuccessful. Within two years Dorothy was dead, but if there were any suspicious circumstances, they were never alluded to. His second wife, whom he had married by 1537, was Mary, daughter of Sir John Gainsford of Crowhurst, Surrey, and widow of Sir William Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1535) of Powderham, Devon. Again a business arrangement may be suspected, and the marriage was a personal failure. By 1552 Kingston was estranged from his wife, and openly keeping a mistress. When John Hooper, the bishop of Gloucester, upbraided him for this adultery, he abused the bishop and struck him a blow, an offence for which he was fined the large sum of &pound;500.<br>
<br>When Edward VI died in July 1553, Kingston was ordered, like many others, to raise men to support Jane Grey's claim. He did not do so, but whether because of lack of sympathy or shortness of time is not apparent. He was regarded with suspicion by Mary's council, and in spite of his position did not sit in the parliaments of October 1553, March 1554, or November 1554. However, in February 1555 he was named to the commission that was established to carry out the death sentence against Hooper for heresy. According to Foxe, Sir Anthony claimed that the bishop had converted him from his sins: &#145;God did appoynt you to call me beyng a lost child&#146;  (Foxe, 1509), presumably as a result of their clash in 1552. He took a tearful farewell of Hooper, but felt constrained to do his duty as a commissioner, and perhaps as a result resumed his county seat in parliament in October 1555, a session for which he was also named knight marshal.<br>
<br>There Kingston played a leading role in frustrating the council's attempt to confiscate the property of the religious exiles, forcing a division at a favourable moment by locking the doors of the house. For this he was briefly in the Tower after the session closed, but was released upon his humble submission. At the same time, however, he was deeply involved in a conspiracy initiated by Henry Dudley and supported by the French ambassador, to launch an invasion by English exiles from France, backed by French arms and money. His plan appears to have been to raise a force in the south-west to support the invasion, and one of the ambassador's agents wrote that he could &#145;assuredly raise more than six thousand men in his district&#146;  (Harbison, 280). This was probably a major exaggeration, but it was never put to the test. The plot was broken up in February and March 1556. Kingston was arrested at the beginning of April, and questioned in Gloucestershire on the 8th and 9th. There was little hard evidence against him, but it was decided to bring him to London. He died on the way, at Cirencester, on 14 April 1556. There is no reason to suppose that the causes were other than natural. He had settled part of his estate on his illegitimate sons, Anthony and Edmund, by a deed of feoffment in 1547, and seems to have left no will. His estranged wife appears to have predeceased him, because, after an inquisition post mortem in October 1556, the residue of his estate passed to a niece, Frances, the wife of Sir Henry Jerningham.<br>
