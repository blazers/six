<span class="headword">Satchwell,  Leonard</span>  (1888&#150;1963), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 30 August 1888 in the village of Attleborough, just outside Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the third and youngest child of Walter Satchwell, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Rachel Hore, previously Herbert, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker, of Dover, Kent. Information is scant on his education and apprenticeship, but it seems that he gained much of his engineering experience in Scotland, and it was apparently there that he met and married his first wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1940).<br>
<br>In 1921 Satchwell, in partnership with a Mr Johns, founded the Rheostatic Company in Slough, which, with its staff of six, operated from a cowshed on the Slough trading estate. The company's function was to manufacture unbreakable power resistors, used for varying the speed of trams and trolleybuses. In 1927 the company introduced the world's first commercially available thermostat, the &#145;C&#146; type, for the control of electric heaters, and soon after the more modern &#145;Q&#146; type room thermostat, which became one of the best-known thermostats of its kind in public and private premises over the next twenty years. At the end of the 1920s, when the company was steadily expanding, a move was made to larger premises on the Farnham Road, Slough.<br>
<br>Satchwell became chairman and managing director of the Rheostatic Company, posts which he held until 1947. The company continued to expand, so that from 1938 to 1939 he was also a director of the Harland Engineering Company and from 1939 to 1947 of a French subsidiary, La Thermostatique. In 1938 he was a director of the British Electric Plant Company. From 1946 to 1949 Satchwell was a director of Janitor Boilers, and from 1947 chairman. That same year he was also chairman of Weatherfoil Heating Systems.<br>
<br>The Rheostatic Company was introduced as a public company on the London stock exchange in 1937. The premises were destroyed by fire under somewhat suspicious circumstances on 2 February 1939, but were completely rebuilt in six weeks. As a result of the need for fuel economy in the Second World War a compensator was developed that enabled heating systems in public buildings to be controlled automatically, depending on the temperature of the weather. The firm's resistors were also in demand for use by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, especially to shield shipboard equipment from the harmful influence of nearby magnetized instruments.<br>
<br>Following the death of Christian in London in early 1940, Satchwell married Winifred Ada Doris (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), the daughter of Edwin Henry Stevens, a retired oil company salesman, and fourteen years his junior, whom he had known for some years through business contacts when the directors went to South Africa to form a subsidiary company, Contractors in Paarl, Cape Province. The marriage took place in Westminster, London, on 3 June 1940. The new Mrs Satchwell was a director of Rheostatic from 1945 to 1947. A divorce then took place, however, and Mrs Satchwell married M. J. Gartside, who took over as chairman of Rheostatic in 1948 following Leonard Satchwell's retirement. Satchwell's long-standing association with Winifred had been the cause of considerable bitterness in the Gartside family.<br>
<br>In 1953 the company sold its resistor business and concentrated on temperature control systems. In 1967 it was acquired by Elliott Automation, which was itself absorbed by the English Electric Company and so became part of the General Electric Company (GEC), the largest electrical manufacturer in Britain.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in the mid-1950s, and probably in Guernsey, where he had made his home following his retirement, Satchwell had married Marion, his third wife. There were no children of any of the three marriages.<br>
<br>Satchwell died of heart failure at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital, St Martin's, Guernsey, on 9 June 1963, and that same year the Rheostatic Company was renamed Satchwell Controls (Satchwell Control Systems from 1964) in commemoration of its founder. Satchwell's widow survived him into the 1990s, when the company was still based in Slough.<br>
