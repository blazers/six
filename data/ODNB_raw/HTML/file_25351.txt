<span class="headword">Shepreve,  John</span>  (1509?&#150;1542), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in Sugworth, Berkshire; the Roman Catholic priest William Shepreve was his nephew. Having gained a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he was appointed a probationer fellow there in 1528. He graduated BA on 3 December 1529, and at an early age was held &#145;in great esteem for his sufficiencies in the Greek and Hebrew tongues&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.81). Shepreve was made a full fellow in 1530, and incorporated MA three years later. The same year also saw his appointment as a supervisor of wine and, more significantly, as a college lecturer in Greek. In 1538 he was made a professor of Hebrew, a position he held concurrently with his college lectureship.<br>
<br>Shepreve was a gifted linguist and poet, much valued by his contemporaries. As a lecturer he sought to combine his devotion to the biblical languages with his conservative beliefs. While the evangelical party at his college claimed that in 1538 Shepreve had allegedly held the view that &#145;the studiying off the scriptures was subversion of goode order&#146;  (Milne, 30&#150;31), in April 1542 he nevertheless petitioned the university authorities for a permission to read on the Hebrew text of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>. There can be no doubt that Shepreve abided by the decree that he should &#145;lecture in godly and catholic fashion&#146;  (Oxford University Archives, register I, fol. 81).<br>
<br>As a poet Shepreve was widely acclaimed; Wood claimed that it was &#145;an ordinary matter with him to compose 100 very good verses every day in his vacant hours&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 1.135). His literary output not only was extraordinarily divergent but also offers a remarkable insight into his beliefs. In his authoritative biography in Latin hexameters of a former president of his college, John Claymond, he described pre-Reformation religious practice with so much genuine affection that a later Edwardian copyist added marginal notes warning the reader &#145;not to give credence&#146; (&#145;ne crede, lector&#146;) to some of the &#145;Papist&#146; practices mentioned  (Corpus Christi College, Oxford, MS 257, fol. 16<i>v</i>, fol. 244<i>r</i>). While Shepreve doubtlessly remained faithful to his conservative beliefs, his Hebrew hymn in praise of Henry VIII suggests that he probably subscribed to the royal supremacy.<br>
<br>Even Shepreve's literary publications are suffused by conservative beliefs. In a versified paraphrase of Ovid's <span class="italic">Phaedra</span>, he reminisced about traditional doctrines of justification and concluded that &#145;as piety is an ancient virtue, we should believe that former generations did good works&#146; (&#145;si vetus est pietas, tanto magis esse tenedam arbitrior antiquis multa fieri bona&#146;; Corpus Christi College, Oxford, MS 266, fol. 29<i>v</i>). A few of his manuscript works were published posthumously by his admirers. His three mnemonic aids to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, composed for his students in Latin verse, were repeatedly incorporated in contemporary commentaries. Shepreve also built up a reputation as an accomplished translator. While his translations of Euripides' <span class="italic">Hecuba</span> into Latin, and Seneca's <span class="italic">Hercules furens</span> into English are no longer extant, his Latin translation of Basil the Great's commentary on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> remains in manuscript. He died in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, in July 1542.<br>
