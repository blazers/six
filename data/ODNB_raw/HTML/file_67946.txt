<span class="headword">Artari,  Giuseppe</span>  (1692/1700&#150;1769), <span class="occ">stuccoist</span>, was one of the most accomplished craftsmen to work in England in the early to mid-eighteenth century. Born at Arogno, near Lugano, Switzerland, he was probably the son of Giovanni Battista Artari (<i>b</i>. 1664), a stuccoist. The evidence of Giuseppe Artari's birth, and other details of his family, derived from the Arogno parish registers and from secondary literature, are confusing, and have been set out in detail  (Beard, 243). In 1759 Horace Walpole noted Artari's first recorded commission in England of about 1715 at Duncombe Park, Yorkshire: &#145;The Stucco work there by one Vassalli &amp; some better by Altari&#146;  (Walpole, 128). Moreover, the stuccoist Alfonso Oldelli (<i>fl</i>. 1696&#150;1720) wrote on 2 July 1721, mentioning the &#145;Signori Artari&#146; at work in England (presumably Giuseppe and possibly his brother Adalbertus (1693&#150;1751)), stating that they were doing well, and that he had a mind to join them  (Martinola, 117).<br>
<br>Stucco-work in England from about 1710 to 1760 was usually a team effort, with different craftsmen contributing their talents. Apart from work with other members of his family, Giuseppe Artari's name is linked, usually, with that of the older stuccoist <a name="cosubject_67236"></a><span class="headword">Giovanni Bagutti</span>  (<em>b. </em>1681, <em>d.</em> in or after 1731)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been born at Rovio, near Lugano. Bagutti was in England by about 1709 when he carried out the first stucco-work recorded since Tudor times at Castle Howard, Yorkshire. Artari joined Bagutti to work on several decorative schemes being undertaken by the architect James Gibbs. Before 1720 they were working on the chapel ceiling at Cannons, Middlesex, the great house of James Brydges, first duke of Chandos; in 1720 at the octagon of Orleans House, Twickenham; from 1722 to 1726 at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London; in 1723&#150;4 at the church of St Peter, Vere Street, London; and in 1725 with other stuccoists (but not Bagutti) Artari was at Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire. All the work, with the exception of that at Cannons, survives. At Ditchley, Artari signed a receipt on 7 December 1725 for &pound;201 12<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. on behalf of work done by &#145;me &amp; my partners&#146;  (Dillon MS, I/3/p/h). These &#145;partners&#146; at Ditchley included the stuccoists Francesco Vassalli (<i>fl</i>. 1724&#150;1763) and Francesco Leone Serena (<i>fl</i>. 1700&#150;1729). One of Artari's principal commissions was at Houghton, Norfolk, built and decorated in the 1720s under the supervision of the architect Colen Campbell. It was at Houghton, the home of the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, that in 1726 Artari's ceiling of the stone hall, with a frieze of cavorting <i>amorini</i>, commemorated the award in June of the Garter star to Sir Robert. Artari charged &pound;131 14<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. for the ceiling, part of three payments to him totalling &pound;560 10<i>s</i>. made between February and May 1728  (Cholmondeley MSS, vouchers, 1727, 1728, 1730).<br>
<br>Artari's association with Bagutti was taken up again in 1730 in work at Moulsham Park, Essex, under the supervision of the architect Giacomo Leoni. The owner, Benjamin Mildmay, Earl Fitzwalter (<i>d</i>. 1756), noted in his account book on 13 February 1731 that he had paid Bagutti (in two sums) &pound;161 8<i>s</i>. but that &#145;my agreamt. was only with Mr. Bagutti &amp; Mr Altari who did the Bustos &amp; Figures assisted him&#146;  (MS 15M50/31, Hants. RO). In the early 1730s Sir Edward Gascoigne (for whom both Giovanni and Giuseppe Artari were to work, <i>c</i>.1735, at his Yorkshire house Parlington Hall, des. <i>c</i>.1950), visited Moor Park, Hertfordshire. He noted that the stuccoes there, surrounding the paintings by Francesco Sleter (all of which survive), were by the Artaris. There is also a drawing annotated &#145;For Mr. Baguti att More Parke near Rikmonsworth in Hertfordshire&#146;, so Bagutti was there too  (Gibbs drawings IV, 24, AM Oxf.). An interesting point about Artari's methods of work was his use of baked moulds of pipe clay, which gave the resulting stuccoes produced therein a sharpness and precision. In 1737, for his stuccoes at Trentham Hall, Staffordshire, the accounts record on 22 March 1738, &#145;Pipe-Clay for Moulds for Mr. Artari&#146;  (MS D 593/F/3/2/12, Staffs. RO).<br>
<br>Artari worked at more than twenty commissions in England and abroad  (see Beard, 243), and at least three are worth more than passing mention. In 1737 he signed a statue of Apollo (still <i>in situ</i>) at Upton House (now Quinton House School), Northamptonshire. The entrance hall there also contains four large medallions, which are presumably also the stuccoist's work. In 1744&#150;5 Artari was the stuccoist for a James Gibbs commission, the Radcliffe Camera, Oxford, for which he received &pound;981 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.  (Gilliam, 29&#150;54). His last recorded work in England, in 1759&#150;60, was also to a Gibbs design, although the architect had died in 1754. At Ragley Hall, Warwickshire, there is a fine baroque scheme in the hall with which Artari's name was associated by Horace Walpole, a friend of Ragley's owner, Lord Conway  (BL, Add. MS 29218, 14 July, 3 Aug 1759, 1 Sept, 13 Dec 1760).<br>
<br>Artari left England about 1760 to work for the elector of Cologne at Schloss Bruhl, and died at Cologne in 1769.<br>
