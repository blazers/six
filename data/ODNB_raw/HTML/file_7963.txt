<span class="headword">Dowland,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1591&#150;1641), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7962/', "John Dowland (1563?&#150;1626)")</script>, lutenist and composer. The likely year of his birth is indicated by his marriage documents, dated 11 October 1626, which state that he was &#145;aged about xxxv yeares&#146;. His godfather was Sir Robert Sidney. During his father's absence abroad he received part of his education in the household of Sir Thomas Monson. Between May 1612 and January 1616 he was employed by William Cavendish, earl of Devonshire, and in February 1613 he was one of the lutenists who played in George Chapman's <span class="italic">Masque of the Inner Temple and Lincoln's Inn</span> which formed part of the wedding festivities of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick, elector palatine. During the early 1620s Dowland travelled abroad with English actors: his name appears among those who sought permission, on 30 August 1623, to return home from the duke of Wolgast in Pomerania.<br>
<br>In 1626 Dowland succeeded his father as one of the royal lutenists, and in the same year he married Jane Smalley (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1601). The registers of St Anne's, Blackfriars, record the burial of a son, John, in December 1627, and the baptism of a daughter, Mary, in April 1629.<br>
<br>There are few surviving lute compositions by Robert Dowland, and he is chiefly remembered for two anthologies published in 1610. <span class="italic">A Varietie of Lute-Lessons</span>, dedicated to Sir Thomas Monson, contains forty-two lute solos, including nine by his father. <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span>, dedicated to his godfather and namesake Sir Robert Sidney, contains one lute solo by John Dowland and twenty ayres for voice, lute, and bass viol, by English, French, Italian, and Spanish composers. Among the English ayres are three by his father, including the powerful &#145;In darkness let me dwell&#146;, but the collection is also interesting for containing songs by other important English lutenists&#151;Daniel Batchelar, Robert Hales, Anthony Holborne, and Richard Martin&#151;who are not generally known as composers of vocal music. Among the foreign pieces is the famous &#145;Amarilli mia bella&#146; by Giulio Caccini.<br>
<br>The records of St Andrew's, Holborn, state that &#145;Robert Doling a man sometyme servant to the king died in his house in the New Buildings in Chancery Lane the 28th buried the 29th November 1641&#146;.<br>
