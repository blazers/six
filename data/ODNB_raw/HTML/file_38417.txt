<span class="headword">Hose,  George Frederick</span>  (1838&#150;1922), <span class="occ">bishop of Singapore, Labuan, and Sarawak</span>, was born in Brunswick Place, Cambridge, on 3 September 1838, the son of Frederick Hose, a clerk, and his wife, Mary Ann Knight. Educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA, he was ordained at Ely as deacon in 1861 and priest the following year. Appointed colonial chaplain at Melaka in 1868, he moved to Singapore in 1872, and two years later became Singapore's first archdeacon, responsible to Bishop Walter Chambers, who was based in Sarawak.<br>
<br>Hose and his gentle wife, Emily, were an intelligent, conscientious, kindly couple, and they fitted happily into Singapore society. Hose was proficient in Malay and a keen botanist, and he helped to found the public library and museum in 1874, and was the prime mover and first president of the Straits Asiatic Society, which in May 1878 was affiliated as the Straits (later Malaysian) branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.<br>
<br>Chambers recommended Hose as his successor, but the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), hesitated, favouring new blood to rejuvenate the diocese. Nevertheless, Hose was eventually appointed, in December 1880, and consecrated by the archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace in London on 26 May 1881; he was enthroned as bishop of Singapore and Labuan in Singapore on 27 November 1881 and given letters patent as bishop of Sarawak from Raja Charles Brooke in Kuching on 17 January 1882.<br>
<br>The unwieldy diocese embraced some 120,000 square miles, with Kuching and Singapore 450 miles apart by sea, and it involved expanding responsibilities for the protected (later federated) Malay states, British North Borneo, and British communities in Siam and the East Indies. In his early years Hose achieved much, attracting many converts and improving schools in Singapore and Kuching. An enthusiastic traveller, he spent half the year in Singapore and the other half in Kuching, with annual tours to outlying Dyak missions and occasional visits to North Borneo, Labuan, and the Malay states. While the Anglican church's prime concern in British Malaya was with westerners, Hose as chaplain in Melaka had set up a mission among the Chinese, and as bishop he encouraged work among Asians in Singapore, Penang, and Kuala Lumpur. He translated the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> into Malay, ordained a few Tamil and Chinese priests, and opened new churches which conducted vernacular services. However, he favoured neither a full Asian ministry, nor the merging of European and Asian congregations.<br>
<br>Always overstretched, the diocese lost ground to the Roman Catholic and Methodist missionaries, who reached out to the Asian communities both in the Peninsula and in Borneo. While in England in 1901, Hose appealed in vain to the SPG for experienced recruits and more resources. Already distressed by Sarawak press criticism of Anglican schools, Hose was then grief-stricken when Emily died of cancer in Kuching in July 1904. Never a man of fire, he lost heart and let administration drift. In Borneo he left matters to the energetic Arthur Sharp, vicar-general at Kuching from 1898. However, despite Sharp's success among Asians, promoting local staff and converting many Chinese, the raja lost patience with the Anglican mission, and, with wide public support, in 1905 the archdeacon of Singapore appealed to the SPG both to send a new young bishop and to divide the see of Singapore from Borneo. This split was unanimously endorsed at a public meeting in Singapore in December 1905.<br>
<br>Initially Hose resisted retiring, and continued to enjoy the relaxing climate, and he planted Borneo's first rubber trees in the beautiful garden he had created with his wife. However, he supported dividing the diocese, which was agreed in principle in 1907, and finally left Kuching in December 1907. He received an affectionate farewell at Singapore's Memorial Hall, on 4 February 1908, and a memorial chalice and paten were afterwards used in his honour on special occasions at St Andrew's Cathedral. After the Lambeth conference in London, Hose submitted his formal resignation, in November 1908, and retired in England. He died at his home, the Manor House, Normandy, near Farnham, Surrey, on 26 March 1922.<br>
