<span class="headword">Trenchard, Sir  John</span>  (1649&#150;1695), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, in Dorset, on 30 March 1649. His father was Thomas Trenchard (1615&#150;1671) of Wolverton and his mother, Hannah Henley (<i>d</i>. 1691), was the daughter of Robert Henley of Bramshill, Hampshire. The family was strongly nonconformist and John Trenchard himself was almost certainly a nonconformist (probably a presbyterian), though a cautious one who avoided prosecution and fulfilled the legal obligations of conformity necessary to hold office. There were other radical connections, two of Trenchard's cousins having married strong supporters of Oliver Cromwell, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26865/', "Colonel William Sydenham")</script> and John Slater. Trenchard himself, in November 1682, married Philip Speke [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/67749">Trenchard,  Philip  (1663/4&#150;1743)</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/26099">Speke,  George</a>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "George Speke")</script>, one of the most outspoken whigs in the south-west, who was to lose one son and nearly a second for participation in the 1685 rebellion.<h2>
<a name="Exclusionist"></a>Exclusionist</h2>At the age of fifteen, in 1665, Trenchard matriculated at New College, Oxford, and went on to a career in law, entering the Middle Temple in 1674. He became active in politics. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War he acted as one of Pierre du Moulin's agents in London, a valuable intermediary in gathering political intelligence and helping to co-ordinate the opposition to Charles's pro-French policies. He went on to win one of the borough of Taunton's seats in the first Exclusion Parliament of 1679, a seat he held in the two following elections of 1679 and 1681.<br>
<br>With three other members of the Trenchard family John became a member of the strongly whig and nonconformist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>. He achieved prominence in the early stages of the Popish Plot, gaining a position on the thirteen-strong committee of secrecy appointed by the Commons to investigate the plot. From the plot, like many other whigs, he moved on to the more dangerous business of attempting to exclude from the succession the heir apparent, James, duke of York, on the grounds that he was a Catholic. Trenchard was one of the seventeen peers and MPs who sensationally presented York as a common popish recusant in June 1680 before the Middlesex grand jury, and in the same year it was he who moved the House of Commons' first <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. He was appointed to the house's committee on the bill, and argued in its third reading that concern for the nation's liberty and religion necessarily overrode any individual's personal rights, even including those of the heir to the throne: &#145;when a thing is <i>pro bono publico</i> we ever step over private Rights&#146;  (J. R. Jones, <span class="italic">The First Whigs</span>, 1961, 138). The high regard in which he was held is indicated by his presence on over thirty Commons committees, from which he was the reporter to the Commons on two (petitioning and the removal of Halifax).<br>
<br>Trenchard was among the core of twenty or so members who were regarded as supporters of the claim of the king's protestant, but illegitimate, son James, duke of Monmouth, to replace the Catholic duke of York as heir to the throne. He had little to do with the earl of Shaftesbury who headed the other, and major, branch of the whigs, which was carefully noncommittal on who should replace York as heir. Trenchard was, however, a regular attender at the King's Head tavern in Fleet Street, the whigs' London headquarters, though he also spent much time waiting on the duke of Monmouth at the latter's house in Soho. While his skills as a lawyer were one reason for Trenchard's prominence in whig circles, no less important was the radical reputation of the town which he represented. Taunton had been strongly parliamentarian during the civil war, harboured many dissenters after it, showed many marks of disrespect for church and crown well into the Restoration, and strongly supported the duke of Monmouth in his rebellion of 1685, providing one-tenth of his total manpower. Trenchard represented the town in all three Exclusion Parliaments, and in the early 1680s was just the man to stoke the fires of opposition there. He allegedly joked that the Trenchard family had as good a claim to the throne as the family of Stuart, and vowed that the duke of Monmouth would be their general in some unnamed enterprise if the king died. He ran Taunton's (whig) Green Ribbon Club with a Quaker deputy to act in his absence, and used the publican of one of the town's inns as another agent.<h2>
<a name="Conspiracyandexile"></a>Conspiracy and exile</h2>When the exclusion movement collapsed after the dissolution of the third Exclusion Parliament of 1681, and a minority of whigs in the next eighteen months began to contemplate armed resistance to the crown, Trenchard was the focus of persistent stories of arms being bought and men being listed in the Taunton area. A former Cromwellian soldier boasted in late 1681 that Trenchard had enlisted him in a troop of horse; a woman claimed to have heard Trenchard around Christmas 1682 speaking of being involved, with others, in some great and secret work; the mayor of Taunton discovered in 1683 that men in his town had been retained and supplied with strong beer to be ready at an hour's notice to fight for Trenchard and Monmouth; and Trenchard persuaded a gunsmith from the village of Trull to move to Taunton, and bought a pair of pistols and muskets from him with the remark that these would do for the king's guards. Confessions and depositions obtained after the discovery of the Rye House plot in 1683, and others following the rebellion of 1685, suggest that Trenchard on several occasions in 1682 and 1683 claimed to be able to raise some 1500 men from the Taunton area to join with other forces from London, Cheshire, and (sometimes) Scotland in ill-defined and shadowy planning for an uprising. However, despite frequent boasts that he had armed men at his disposal, when told by the plot leaders to prepare for action he pleaded that they were not yet ready, and sent word to a meeting of the conspirators in November 1682 requesting a delay of two or three weeks more for his men to make arrangements for their families. Ford, Lord Grey, one of the plotters, believed he plainly saw fear on Trenchard's face when action seemed imminent, and it seems to have been repeated delays in Taunton which made Shaftesbury in December 1682 despair of conspiracy and flee abroad to the Netherlands. There is no clear evidence that Trenchard seriously prepared for a rising, for when the government learned of the Rye House plot (allegedly to assassinate the king), and in summer 1683 launched a series of arrests and house searches, only two or three old firearms and no incriminating papers at all were found in his house, and nothing of significance in those of his Somerset friends. Investigations into talk of arms caches for sixty to eighty men and gunpowder by the barrelful found it to be nothing but talk. But though Trenchard, like most of the whigs caught up in desperate post-exclusion plotting, clearly preferred talk to action, it should be noted that when a genuine rebellion broke out in 1685 several thousand Somerset men did join up in a matter of days, and Taunton was easily the strongest centre of support for the rebel duke.<br>
<br>In July 1683 Trenchard was one of the many whigs arrested following the revelation of the Rye House plot. Held in the Tower for six months and given pen and paper to make a full confession, he defended himself with considerable skill (helped by the refusal of Lord William Russell to testify against him), and he was released for lack of sufficient evidence in December 1683. With two others he was shown and commented on the draft of the duke of Monmouth's public &#145;confession&#146; of December 1683, and he was given an enthusiastic welcome in Somerset towns on his way home, but his spell in the Tower had evidently chastened him. He lived quietly at his Dorset home and maintained no contact with fellow conspirators who had fled abroad. His wife was arrested at a conventicle, but not Trenchard himself. By his own account he received word of the duke of Monmouth's planned rising four days before Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis and, estimating correctly that the duke would receive no support at all from the gentry and aristocracy and that the rising would therefore fail catastrophically, he raised what money he could and prepared to leave England. The government, however, sent two privy council messengers to arrest him, and he only just escaped: some time later his father-in-law George Speke was fined 2000 marks for helping him by obstructing the messengers. Angry at the way he had deserted their cause, the rebel leaders captured after the rising, such as Ford, Lord Grey, tried in their confessions to implicate Trenchard as deeply as they could in treasonable conspiracy, while simultaneously labelling him a coward. Possibly because of these accusations his prudence in having nothing whatever to do with the rebellion did him no good with the government and he remained on the wanted list&#151;pardons granted by James II in March 1686 did not include him.<br>
<br>Despairing for the moment of an early return to England Trenchard threw himself into the society of English exiles in the Netherlands, and was accepted by them with surprising ease. He was seen in the company of notorious enemies of James II, boasted that he would now play a leading role rather than see anti-government conspiracies fail yet again, and helped finance a venture to set up a cloth manufacturing business in the Netherlands to provide work for the English exiles. With some other exile leaders he toyed briefly with the idea of setting up a handsome young man who had arrived in the Netherlands from Earl Shilton, Leicestershire, as the late duke of Monmouth's &#145;son&#146;, but decided against trying to run such an improbable pretender. With an eye to his long-term future, however, he continued to assure government agents that he had taken part in neither the Rye House plot nor the 1685 rebellion, and in December 1687 he had his reward when he was finally granted a pardon. He returned to England and early in 1688 returned cautiously to politics. He was among those &#145;closeted&#146; with James II in 1688, but like other former whigs he had no influence upon the king. The reports of James's election agents described the determination of their local whig collaborators in Taunton to have Trenchard in place as MP there in the intended forthcoming election under a newly restricted franchise. There is no evidence that he played any role in the plotting which climaxed with William of Orange's arrival at Torbay in November 1688, but once the prince was ashore Trenchard worked actively for him, raising &pound;250 from a pair of west country clothiers.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstate"></a>Secretary of state</h2>Paying the price for his association with James, Trenchard was rejected by the electors of his old seat of Taunton in 1689. He sat briefly for Thetford and then (from 1690) for Poole. Between the revolution and 1690 he received a series of marks of the king's favour: comptroller of customs for Bristol, chief justice of Cheshire, recorder of Taunton, serjeant-at-law and then king's serjeant, and a knighthood. In parliament he displayed his old vigour, mastery of detail, and fluency in debate, working this time in the interest of the government. By 1693 he had been appointed to a score of parliamentary committees, at the rate of five or six per session, ranging from regulating prisons and attainting rebels to improving the poor law, repairing Dover harbour, and allowing surgeons to prescribe medicines. He managed conferences with the Lords, chaired the Commons committee on elections and privileges from 1691 to 1693, and in the latter year was three times chairman of the Commons ways and means committee. Known as a thoroughly dependable whig, it is no surprise that in the summer of 1693 Sunderland was grooming him to be one of the court managers in the Commons, with particular responsibility for the crucial business of supply.<br>
<br>Trenchard reached the pinnacle of his career in March 1693 when he was appointed one of the two secretaries of state. Though his was the northern (and junior) department, responsibility for naval affairs was added to his office, evidently in the hope that his drive would improve a very lacklustre war at sea against the French. His confidence in office was widely noticed, though opinion about his character was divided: Anthony Wood described him as &#145;a man of turbulent and aspiring spirit, never contented&#146;, though Bishop Burnet saw &#145;a calm and sedate man &hellip; much more moderate than could have been expected, since he was a leading man in a party&#146; (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.405; Burnet, 4.193&#150;4). In addition to his naval business he set up a chain of watchers along the French channel coast, pursued Jacobites, and took an interest in Irish affairs. He had a hand in key policy matters, becoming one of the five-man cabinet council set up to take decisions during William's absences abroad. In 1693&#150;4, however, he was involved in two government fiascos, though characteristically he emerged from each formally exonerated of any blame, and still in the government's confidence. In May 1693 a report that French warships had put to sea was not communicated to the fleet, and largely in consequence of this a convoy of merchant ships bound for Smyrna was destroyed. Two admirals and the other secretary of state were sacked, but two parliamentary inquiries found it impossible to apportion blame any further and the matter was dropped. A year later Trenchard took an active, though secondary, part in the investigation of the Lancashire plot, and once again escaped without blame when the government case ignominiously collapsed, though he may have been damaged by allegations that his agents had improperly used search warrants, planted evidence, and taken bribes. By this time he had become ill with tuberculosis, and in August and December 1694 he retired to Dorset to improve his health. He was described as very weak, pale, and thin, and by the spring of 1695 his doctors despaired of his recovery. He died on 27 April 1695 at Kensington. He was buried at Bloxworth church, Dorset, near his house at Lytchett Matravers. His wife, Philippa, lived on until 1743, dying at the age of seventy-nine. Of their four sons and three daughters only one son, George, survived to have children.<br>
