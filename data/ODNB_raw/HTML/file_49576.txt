<span class="headword">Beattie,  David Wilson</span>  (1938&#150;1991), <span class="occ">venture capitalist</span>, was born on 30 September 1938 at Tir-na-Nog, Carleton Road, Carlisle, Cumberland, the elder son and second child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Ronald Joseph Edward Beattie and his wife, Margaret Knott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Christie. His father was a stonemason, working for the family business making tombstones and monuments. He was educated at Carlisle grammar school, and graduated from Manchester University in 1960 with an upper second class degree in mathematics, statistics, and aerodynamics. His first job was as a statistical assistant with Cadbury Brothers, the chocolate manufacturers, and at the same time he qualified as a cost and management accountant. On 8 June 1963 he married Pauline Holloway, a secretary, daughter of William Ralph Holloway, a civil engineer; they had two daughters, one of whom died in childhood. After a year with Johnson and Johnson, Beattie was invited back to Cadbury in 1964 to be development director of McVitie Cadbury Cakes, and was then appointed financial planning manager for Cadbury Schweppes (Overseas), and finally managing director of the speciality foods division.<br>
<br>In 1974 Beattie left Cadbury to join the National Enterprise Board (NEB), set up in 1974 by the Labour government. One of its roles was to encourage industry by investing government money into smaller companies that were finding it difficult to attract capital, and Beattie was appointed director of the smaller companies division, defined as companies with fewer than 1000 employees. By 1978 the public accounts committee was reporting that of the nineteen companies in which the NEB had invested, only ten had made a profit, but the NEB argued that a few more years were needed before these companies could show a substantial return on government capital. Beattie was then appointed director of the business development division of the NEB, responsible for investment in advanced technology, and he concentrated his efforts on the electronics industry, committing public money to such companies as INMOS, which made silicon chips, INSAC, exporter of British software technology, and ICL, the computer systems manufacturer. But after the election in 1979 of a Conservative government headed by Margaret Thatcher, and the beginning of a wave of privatizations, the government encouraged the NEB to dispose of its companies. Beattie was aware that the smallest NEB investments would be difficult to sell, and in 1981 he persuaded the NEB to set up a new company, Grosvenor Development Capital (so called because the headquarters of the NEB was in Grosvenor Gardens, Victoria, London), as a holding company for the eight smallest NEB companies. In effect this amounted to the privatization of these NEB venture capital investments. Beattie was appointed managing director in 1982, and in February 1982, at a time when the venture capital industry was just beginning to increase in size and scale, Beattie raised &pound;6.9 million from three City institutions, including the British Rail Pension Fund, for Grosvenor Development Capital, reducing the government's stake to 30 per cent. In 1985 Beattie and his team formed their own management company, Grosvenor Venture Managers, based in Slough, to help in the management of several companies, and they were given the contract to manage Grosvenor Development Capital. Beattie was chairman and managing director. Grosvenor Venture Managers launched a new fund, Grosvenor Technology Fund, which attracted &pound;9.5 million in 1985, and two more funds in 1988 and 1989. By 1990 he had raised &pound;60 million for these companies, and he floated Grosvenor Development Capital on the stock market as an investment trust. A profitable and well-run company, Grosvenor Venture Managers was sold to Mercury Asset Management in 1994 for over &pound;4 million.<br>
<br>From a Christian background, Beattie was involved from his university days in stimulating missionary interest, and Christianity remained at the centre of his life. He was an elder of Maidenhead Baptist Church, and from 1983 he was on the council of the Scripture Gift Mission, a mission to distribute free <span class="roman">Bible</span> resources in their own languages to people all over the world. Most of his spare time was devoted to church activities, but he was also an enthusiast for steam trains and aeroplanes, keeping a list of every plane he had flown on.<br>
<br>In 1989 Beattie resigned as managing director of Grosvenor Venture Managers but carried on as an active chairman. He died of a heart attack on 13 August 1991, at his home, Caldbeck, Nursery Walk, Marlow, Buckinghamshire.<br>
