<span class="headword">Sparke,  Joseph</span>  (1682&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born at Peterborough on 16 December 1682, the son of John Sparke, a feoffee of the town. He was educated at the town grammar school and in 1699 entered St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1704. He was appointed under-master at his old school in 1704, ordained deacon in 1705, and made a minor canon of the cathedral on 2 September 1706. He was ordained priest on 23 September 1710 and served the curacy of Eye. On 29 June 1710 he married Rebecca Wigmore (1692&#150;1747), a widow, at Peterborough.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1714 Sparke was appointed registrar, chapter clerk, and master of the works at Peterborough Cathedral, succeeding John Brown, who had got into financial difficulties and to whom Sparke remitted some of the fees attached to the office. His responsibilities included the care of the books belonging to the dean and chapter and the making of a full index of their contexts. He had already entered into correspondence with White Kennett, the antiquarian bishop of Peterborough, and soon began to co-operate with him on the history of the cathedral, correcting the work of Simon Gunton. He remained a close collaborator of Kennett, though they quarrelled over fees due to Sparke in 1720, by which date he had been appointed cathedral librarian, charged with the care of the extensive library presented by the bishop. Sparke had already recatalogued the library of the earl of Cardigan at Deene. In 1723 Sparke published <span class="italic">Historiae Anglicanae scriptores varii</span>, comprising the chronicles of John of Peterborough, Hugh Candidus, and Robert of Swaffham, and Fitzstephen's life of Becket, though the text owed more to White Kennett's work than was suggested in the volume. The volume was published from a transcript provided by the Northamptonshire historian John Bridges (in whose house he wrote the preface to part two of the volume); despite containing a number of errors, it was a significant contribution to local history.<br>
<br>Sparke was appointed rector of Paston in 1719, where his wife's former husband had also served, but moved to the valuable capitular living of Northborough on 18 June 1723, continuing as rector until his death. He was a founder member of the Gentlemen's Society of Peterborough, founded by a fellow minor canon and St John's man, Timothy Neve, and also belonged to the more famous society at Spalding in Lincolnshire. In 1726 he was given extended leave of absence from his cathedral duties on account of ill health, and from 1731 these were performed by a more or less permanent deputy. Sparke had proposed a second volume of Peterborough chronicles but it remained unpublished, though almost ready for the press at his death. He died at Peterborough on 20 July 1740 and was buried in the cathedral on 25 July. There is a monument to him in the choir of the cathedral, but perhaps the best epitaph comes from the pen of the Oxford antiquary Thomas Hearne, who described Sparke thus in 1725:<blockquote>Mr Sparke is an excellent scholar, of a great memory, admirably well versed in the Editions of Books, that he is mad a quarter of a year together every year &hellip; that he is very sober &hellip; &amp; that he is always among his Books, wholly delighting in Study. (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.382)</blockquote>
