<span class="headword">Bishop,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1668), <span class="occ">government official and religious writer</span>, was born in Bristol, probably the son of Thomas Bishop, brewer, who became a freeman of the city in 1612. A local and London administrator as well as a New Model Army captain during the civil wars, Bishop is significant because he possessed the organizational and literary skills that proved invaluable to the establishment of the Quaker movement in seventeenth-century Bristol. A man of evident education and a skilled publicist, Bishop wrote more than thirty Quaker tracts. Rich in apocalyptic imagery and Jeremianic in tone, his arguments are grounded in scripture, early church history, politics, and natural reason. His religious ideas are infused with republican sentiments that distrust power wielded by monarchs and clerics alike.<br>
<br>In 1648 Bishop married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of William Canne, mayor of Bristol and a powerful local figure. His father-in-law's influence may have kept Bishop out of harm's way during his early years of organizing and publishing on the Quakers' behalf. The Bishops' only surviving child, Elizabeth (1655&#150;1724), married the Quaker writer Richard Vickris in 1672 and raised eight or nine children at Firgrove, the Vickris estate in Chew Magna, Somerset.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Bishop fought with the parliamentary army, and evidently was the politically radical Captain Bishop who in the army debates at Putney in 1647 advocated regicide, attributing the kingdom's difficulties to Charles I, &#145;that man of blood&#146;. His appointment in 1650 as secretary to the committee for examinations of the republican council of state brought him to London, where he and Thomas Scott headed the intelligence operation and skilfully countered royalist conspiracy. Bishop's reports disclose an intense, perhaps overstated, concern for the fragile Commonwealth, which in his estimation had &#145;clouds darkening over it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Original letters and papers</span>, 54). During the First Anglo-Dutch War Bishop gathered military intelligence, but in 1653 he was dismissed for &#145;intermeddling in foreign affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;1654</i>, 14) and was questioned about expenses for which he sought reimbursement. Unsubstantiated allegations of Bishop misusing his political post in unseemly and dishonest ways must be understood in the context of interregnum politics, his association with the Quakers, and the atmosphere of factionalism and dysfunction that haunted the republic. Citing examples of his loyal service to the council of state, which had exacted financial and personal costs, Bishop resigned from his post in September 1653. He returned to Bristol, where he unsuccessfully stood for parliament in the 1654 elections and continued in a private capacity his efforts to secure a godly commonwealth and liberty of conscience. After the installation of the protectorate Bishop accused Cromwell of harbouring kingly ambitions, allying himself with John Wildman and other radical republicans who believed the lord protector had surpassed the late king in exercising arbitrary power. Under the protectorate the various intelligence positions, including Bishop's, were combined and administered by John Thurloe.<br>
<br>Bishop's association with the Quakers followed the visit of itinerant preachers John Audland and John Camm to Bristol in 1654. His conversion sharpened his criticism of national and local politicians, who in turn questioned his integrity. Bishop soon abandoned the &#145;exalted&#146; demeanour that troubled his brethren, and his organizational skills made him an invaluable member of the emerging movement. His early tracts, including <span class="italic">The Cry of Blood</span> (1656) and <span class="italic">The Throne of Truth</span> (1657), provide insight into the early Quakers' denunciation of the Presbyterian settlement, and their own vociferous performances of protest, which frequently resulted in violence and arrest. In 1656 his Bristol neighbour Captain Edward Pyot and other imprisoned Quakers forwarded Bishop accounts of their experiences, which he published in <span class="italic">The West Answering to the North</span> (1656), a work formerly credited to George Fox. As a Quaker spokesman Bishop denounced the protectorate's ambiguous religious and social policy, which reflected a growing weariness with radical sectarianism. In 1659, when for a brief time it seemed that reforms would be legislated, Bishop petitioned the recalled Rump Parliament to support &#145;The Good Old Cause&#146;.<br>
<br>Dating Bishop's commitment to peace must be nuanced. From the outset of the Quaker movement, George Fox had advocated the principle of peace. Bishop, however, wore his sword until at least 1655, when he was with Fox at Reading. On 26 February 1655 he wrote to Thurloe, commenting he was now &#145;looking after a kingdom that cannot be shaken&#146; and &#145;studying peace with truth&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Rawlinson MS A. 24, fols. 295&#150;6). However, when the republic was faltering in 1659, Bishop's associates, including his co-authors of <span class="italic">Cry of Blood</span>, served as militia commissioners from Bristol, and after Major-General John Lambert dismissed the reassembled Rump Parliament on 13 October Bishop urged the army to take the lead in reform. Shortly after the restoration he employed Fifth Monarchist tones in his advice to the divided army that they be not &#145;shaken nor stumbled&#146; but turn inward as &#145;man's day is done but the Lord's is come&#146;  (G. Bishop, <span class="italic">The Warnings of the Lord</span>, 1660, 42).<br>
<br>When the newly restored king visited Bristol, Bishop conveyed a welcome from the Quakers. Underscoring their peaceful intentions, he played a leading role in advocating religious liberty and publicizing Quaker principles and beliefs. Although Charles II had initially promised toleration to nonconformists, Bishop anticipated the legal prescriptions of the Clarendon code and the 1662 <span class="roman">Quaker Act</span>. In <span class="italic">To thee Charles Stuart King of England</span> (1660) he warned the king that, like King David, he must govern the faithful justly lest he repeat the disaster that had toppled &#145;the other chaff before thee&#146;  (p. 6).<br>
<br>Bishop was subsequently arrested on several occasions for attending illegal religious meetings and refusing to give surety of good behaviour. As the Quakers grew quieter in their response to religious intolerance, he advocated passive resistance to state regulation of religious worship. His <span class="italic">Illumination to Open the Eyes of Papists</span> (1661), reflective of the contemporary interest in scientific discourse, argues that moral restraints on conscience are ineffective since force &#145;can reach no further than to that which is of the same Nature with it. A thing cannot be extended beyond its Principle&#146;  (p. 10). Bishop's best-known work, <span class="italic">New England Judged</span> (1661, 1667, 1703), compiled from firsthand reports conveyed to Bristol, is a standard account of the puritans' persecution of Quakers in colonial America. Bishop's widely read account may well be the Quaker text to which Hawthorne alluded in <span class="italic">The Scarlet Letter</span>.<br>
<br>Bishop died in Bristol in November 1668. A state official commented on the unusually large gathering of &#145;that sect&#146; who attended the burial of their &#145;archbishop&#146; near Redcliff parish; the turn-out fittingly symbolized George Bishop's contribution to the establishment of Quakerism in Bristol.<br>
