<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Philip Henry</span>, fifth Earl Stanhope  (1805&#150;1875), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Walmer, Kent, on 30 January 1805. He was the elder and only surviving son of <a name="cosubject_60698"></a><span class="headword">Philip Henry Stanhope</span>, fourth Earl Stanhope  (1781&#150;1855), <span class="occ">politician</span>, and his second wife, Catherine Lucy (1786&#150;1843), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25892/', "Robert Smith, first Baron Carrington")</script>. His sister Catherine Lucy Wilhelmina, duchess of Cleveland (<i>d</i>. 1901), was the mother of Archibald Philip Primrose, fifth earl of Rosebery, the prime minister. The father was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26241/', "Charles Stanhope, third Earl Stanhope")</script>, and was born on 4 December 1781. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26247/', "Lady Hester Stanhope")</script>, the confidante of Pitt the younger, was his half-sister and the Stanhopes were variously intertwined with the Pitts. He was estranged from his father, and reacted strongly against his radical education, but his career in the Commons was sustained by his father-in-law, Lord Carrington, and his connection with William Pitt gained him sinecures such as the surveyorship of the green wax. He was MP for Windsor (1806&#150;7), Hull (1807&#150;12), and Midhurst (1812&#150;16). His father excluded him as far as possible from his inheritance and, after succeeding to the title in 1816, the fourth earl spent almost half of his time on the continent, especially in Germany. In 1829 he there met Kaspar Hauser, the &#145;child of Europe&#146;, whose identity and authenticity was one of the historical &#145;mysteries&#146; of the nineteenth century. Stanhope was initially attracted to Hauser and believed him to be wrongly accused of deception. He in effect adopted the youth and, though he came to the view that Hauser was a pathological liar, defended him in pamphlets in German and English, mostly collected as <span class="italic">Tracts Relating to Caspar Hauser</span> (1836). In politics the fourth earl was a maverick ultra-tory, who opposed Catholic emancipation and promoted political reform. He violently opposed the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span> of 1834 and served notice on a tenant who became a poor-law guardian. In 1838 he became president of the London Central Anti-Poor Law Association. In the 1840s free trade replaced the poor law as Stanhope's <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> and in 1843 he founded the Society for the Protection of British Industry. Believing these ills were the result of a corrupt Commons, he advocated further parliamentary reform and moved close to the Chartists. After his wife's death in 1843 Stanhope ceased travelling and lived at the family seat, Chevening, Kent; there he died on 2 March 1855.<h2>
<a name="Educationandpolitics"></a>Education and politics</h2>Philip Stanhope, who thus became fifth Earl Stanhope, shared few of his father's extreme opinions, though the relations between them, unlike those between the father and the grandfather, were cordial. From 1816 until his father's death in 1855 he was styled Lord Mahon. Educated at home by tutors, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 19 April 1823 and graduated BA in 1827; he was elected FRS the same year. On 10 July 1834 he married Emily Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kerrison (<i>d</i>. 1873).<br>
<br>Mahon seems to have gained little from his time at Oxford. In 1825&#150;6 he toured the continent, from which came his first book, <span class="italic">The Life of Belisarius</span> (1829). His father opposed his wish to enter the army and thus he instead entered the Commons, sitting as an independent for the rotten borough of Wootton Bassett from 1830 to 1832, when the seat was disfranchised. Mahon was a strong supporter of Peel, who differed from his father in opposing parliamentary reform. His maiden speech on 22 March 1831, opposing the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, made a strong impression and on 1 July 1831 he presented the Oxford University petition against the bill. In December 1832 he was elected for Hertford, defeating Thomas Duncombe, but he was unseated on petition.<br>
<br>Mahon thus found himself, though without a seat, among the political group later to be called Peelites. He was cautious about a wholehearted commitment to politics, and was already well into historical studies. However, during Peel's brief government of December 1834 to April 1835 he was under-secretary for foreign affairs, with the duke of Wellington as foreign secretary; Mahon had especial responsibility for South America and central and southern Europe. Wellington being in the Lords, Mahon had to answer Palmerston's criticisms in the Commons. His defence of the government's Spanish policy incurred considerable criticism from the whigs: Clarendon referred to &#145;that little shrivelled old woman, Mahon&#146;  (Newman, 258). Mahon was elected for Hertford at the general election of 1835 and held the seat until he went to the Lords in 1855. But his caution about office increased. He declined to return to the under-secretaryship when the Conservatives came back into office in 1841.<br>
<br>Mahon declined, repented, and again declined the Madrid embassy in 1843. He declined and then accepted the secretaryship of the Board of Control for India in June 1845 and reluctantly went with Peel over the repeal of the corn laws in 1845&#150;6. After 1846 he did not again hold political office. After Peel's death in 1850 he drifted away from the Peelites and after 1855 played some part on the Conservative side in the Lords. He declined the embassies in Vienna and St Petersburg when Lord Derby offered them to him in 1858, but was then piqued when Derby did not offer him a post in 1866, and complained that he should not only be thought of as a potential diplomatist. But when Derby offered him the duchy of Lancaster in 1867, he declined it. This pattern of reluctance&#151;which foreshadowed that of his nephew Rosebery&#151;was not the result of caution about Conservatism, which he increasingly supported, though never in his father's extreme fashion. Stanhope played an occasional part in legislation; it was his amendment to the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> in 1867 which ended the requirement of a general election on the death of the monarch. He was a member of several royal commissions, including those on clerical subscription (1864), the Irish church (1867), and ritual and rubrics (1868). Had he wished to submit himself to the daily political round, he could have been a prominent tory cabinet member. But his interests were wider and his dislike of impromptu speaking greater than that role required.<h2>
<a name="Mahonashistorian"></a>Mahon as historian</h2>Lord John Russell spent his years in opposition writing whig history, especially of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. So, at much the same time, did Lord Mahon perform the same service for the Conservatives. But in the latter's case it quite quickly became his overriding interest. His first book on British history was <span class="italic">The History of the War of Succession in Spain, 1702&#150;1714</span> (1832; 2nd edn, 1836). It was written largely from the papers of his ancestor James Stanhope, first Earl Stanhope, which were at Chevening. This established Mahon's pattern and his contribution: an accurate and honest use of thoroughly researched private papers (usually, but not exclusively, those of his relatives). Macaulay's slightly patronizing review in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (January 1833) argued fairly that Mahon's style was &#145;now and then unpleasantly stiff&#146; and that he was &#145;a little too fond of uttering moral reflections in a style too sententious and oracular&#146;  (Newman, 286). Mahon's next book was <span class="italic">The History of England from the Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles, 1713&#150;1783</span> (7 vols., 1836&#150;53); an American edition of volumes 1&#150;4 was published in 1849 and the sections on India were published in 1838 as <span class="italic">The Rise of our Indian Empire</span>. For many years this <span class="italic">History of England</span> was regarded as the standard narrative work on the eighteenth century. Mahon's comments on George Washington involved him in a prolonged row with various American writers, and various pamphlets were published, including Mahon's <span class="italic">Letter to Jared Sparks</span> (1852). In 1840 he published <span class="italic">Spain under Charles II</span>, chiefly extracts from the correspondence of his relative Alexander Stanhope, British minister at Madrid (1690&#150;1700), and in 1842 <span class="italic">Essais sur la vie du grand Cond&eacute;</span> (privately printed in 100 copies); it was published in English in 1845. In 1851 he published a work begun in 1838 and the product of his membership from 1837 to 1847 of the Roxburghe Club: <span class="italic">The Forty-Five; being a Narrative of the Rebellion in Scotland</span>, for which he researched at the state paper office.<br>
<br>This steady flow of volumes established Mahon as a leading historian, not merely in terms of his readership, which anticipated Macaulay's, but in terms of his method: his documentary forays remain of value. Mahon was also an important historian of his own times. Fascinated by Wellington, he carefully recorded the duke's conversation, and deliberately led the latter to comment on hitherto undiscussed episodes. <span class="italic">Notes of Conversations with Wellington</span> was published posthumously (1888). Mahon was, with Edward Cardwell, Sir Robert Peel's executor, and their rapid publication (2 vols. and 3 parts, 1856&#150;7) of Peel's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>&#151;chiefly in fact political memoranda&#151;boldly responded to the biographical initiative taken by Disraeli by his biography of Peel's rival Lord George Bentinck (1852).<br>
<br>Mahon's habit of working from collections of papers readily to hand pointed naturally to studies of his Pitt relatives. In 1842 he produced <span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt and Charles, Duke of Rutland</span> and in 1852 <span class="italic">Secret Correspondence Connected with Mr Pitt's Return to Office in 1804</span>. In 1855 John Murray, his publisher, suggested a life of Pitt the younger, but he initially declined to write it. However, his interest was titillated by the arrival at Chevening of a substantial part of the Pitt papers, lent by a relative, Pitt's great-nephew Colonel Pringle. Stanhope&#151;as Mahon had become&#151;thus had a chance temporarily to add these to the Chevening papers and others that he borrowed, thus assembling a large collection of Pittiana. Stanhope's <span class="italic">Life of &hellip; William Pitt</span> was published in four volumes in 1861&#150;2; it was in a fourth edition by 1867, and a new edition with corrections was published posthumously (1879). Stanhope believed he might &#145;be in error when I venture to pronounce him the greatest of all the statesmen that his country has produced&#146;  (Stanhope, <span class="italic">Life of Pitt</span>, 4, 1862, 420), but he did not seriously question his own judgement. However, his biography was not hagiographical. Its firm base in accurately transcribed texts gave it lasting value regardless of its interpretation of events, and as an account it has not been altogether superseded. The assessment of John Ehrman, Pitt's recent biographer, is that Stanhope &#145;is Pitt's best biographer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Younger Pitt</span>, 1969, 69). Stanhope's transcriptions of George III's letters began the rehabilitation of that misunderstood monarch. Stanhope completed his writings on the eighteenth century with <span class="italic">The History of England, Comprising the Reign of Queen Anne until the Peace of Utrecht</span> (1870), a book intended to bridge the gap between the end of Macaulay's <span class="italic">History</span> and the start of Stanhope's own earlier work, a slightly curious intention given Stanhope's political differences from Macaulay.<br>
<br>Throughout his writing life Stanhope's enthusiasm for documents generated extra volumes of correspondence, often printed privately, to the extent that &#145;it is not possible even now to establish with certainty a complete canon of his works&#146;  (Newman, 282). He edited Lord Chesterfield's letters (5 vols., 1845&#150;53) but declined John Murray's request that he edit Lord Hervey's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>Stanhope realized that his documentary interests suggested more than historical writing. From the 1830s he played an active role in encouraging public interest in the preservation and ordering of the public records, and he served on the royal commission for the publishing of state papers until it ceased in 1854, and he was a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts from its foundation in 1869 until his death. When Thomas Noon Talfourd lost his seat in 1841, Mahon continued Talfourd's attempts to reform the law of copyright. Mahon's bill of 1842, amended by Macaulay and with a compromise between the various parties, became law and established copyright periods for the rest of the nineteenth century. In 1841 Mahon had become a vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries (succeeding Henry Hallam); in 1846 he became president, an office he held for nearly thirty years. As such, he was also a trustee of the British Museum and a member of the Royal Academy's council. In 1844 he was appointed a commissioner for promoting the fine arts; he consequently became involved in the decoration of the new Palace of Westminster, and chaired several of the relevant subcommittees. He proposed a parliamentary grant for excavations on the supposed site of Troy. This exposed him to Robert Lowe's sarcasm, but Heinrich Schliemann's discovery gave Stanhope ample revenge.<h2>
<a name="FoundingtheNationalPortraitGallery"></a>Founding the National Portrait Gallery</h2>Of these many forward-looking interests, one was to bear especial fruit. In 1845 Mahon raised in the Commons the idea of a national collection of portraits. On 4 June 1852, probably seeing in Disraeli a chancellor of the exchequer who might be generous, Mahon again raised the matter in the Commons and Disraeli responded favourably. Changes of government and the costly Crimean War intervened, and it was not until 4 March 1856 that Stanhope (by now in the Lords, quoting a letter from Thomas Carlyle in support) moved a motion which, after amendment, recognized &#145;the expediency of forming a Gallery of the Portraits of the most eminent Persons in British History&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 140.1789). Stanhope had already secured the support of the prince consort and of Sir Charles Eastlake, director of the National Gallery (Eastlake's letter advocated the association of the portraits with good biographical notices). The commissioners of the National Portrait Gallery first met on 9 February 1857 and elected Stanhope chairman. Stanhope quickly appointed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24796/', "George Scharf")</script> as secretary and saw the gallery through its first twenty years, chairing the trustees, as they became, until his death. A plaster medallion of Lawrence Macdonald's bust of Stanhope is appropriately placed above the entrance doorway of the National Portrait Gallery; it was presented by Scharf.<h2>
<a name="Appearancelastyearsandassessment"></a>Appearance, last years, and assessment</h2>Stanhope was physically unimposing, often being referred to as &#145;little&#146;, though he seems to have been of average height. He had a large head, and a slight lisp when speaking in public. J. L. Motley described him as &#145;a slender, thin man, with handsome features, curly hair, with spectacles&#146;  (Newman, 309). His daughter-in-law found him &#145;highly strung &hellip; fond of ladies' society and somewhat helpless in the trifles of life&#146;  (ibid., 312). His wife was jolly and enjoyed jokes, such as menus composed of dishes her husband disliked. She suffered from asthma and bronchitis, for which they often in old age went to Germany. She died of bronchitis on 31 December 1873 at Chevening and was buried there. Two years later, when convalescing, Stanhope died of pleurisy at Merivale House, Bournemouth, on 24 December 1875; he was buried at Chevening on 30 December. He was succeeded in the title by his son Arthur Philip Stanhope (1838&#150;1905). His second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26245/', "Edward Stanhope")</script>, became president of the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>Stanhope was insufficiently speculative to be a great historian. But he was certainly a good one, and his influence on the understanding and maintenance of the British past was pervasive and beneficial.<br>
