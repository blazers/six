<span class="headword">Cornish,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was apparently a native of Wiltshire and was originally of &#145;a mean servile condition&#146;, according to a detractor  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>Jan&#150;June 1683</i>, 315). A cloth factor resident in London, perhaps from as early as 1659, he became a freeman of the Haberdashers' Company in 1668 and served as its master in 1680&#150;82. After 1671 he lived in Cateaton Street, Cheapside, in the parish of St Lawrence Jewry. He carried on his business there, eventually with partners Thomas Cornish and John DeVink, one of his sons-in-law. He also maintained a country house at Bromley, owned other London properties, and possessed lands in Somerset. An occasional conformist, he probably had presbyterian preferences: a daughter married a son of Henry Ashurst, the city's most prominent presbyterian layman, and Cornish had business connections to the dissenting Foley family of Worcestershire. His relationship to a contemporary west country dissenting divine of the same name (an ejected canon of Christ Church, Oxford) is unknown.<br>
<br>In May 1679 Cornish was one of the first to sign a city petition intended to encourage parliamentary adoption of a bill to exclude James, duke of York, from the succession. For the remainder of Charles II's reign he took a leading part in civic politics. The election of Cornish and Slingsby Bethel as sheriffs of London and Middlesex in June 1680 signalled a seizing of the political initiative in the city by those who would soon be called whigs. It was also intended to promote accommodation between the state church and reformed protestants outside the church. However, neither Cornish nor Bethel had qualified by taking the oaths intended to prevent dissenters from holding office, so their elections were disallowed. Despite the king's appearances in the city to assist the secretary of state, Leoline Jenkins, in promoting loyalist candidates, Cornish and Bethel headed the poll in a second election. By that time they had also satisfied the religious tests. Jenkins &#145;fear[ed] more from Cornish&#146; than from Bethel, although Bethel was generally regarded as a republican  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 620). Charles declined to knight either of the new sheriffs, as would have been customary. Cornish was also returned as alderman for Vintry ward in 1680, and he was eventually accepted by the court of aldermen despite loyalist objections.<br>
<br>Bethel and Cornish were not friends: they clashed almost immediately over the choice of an under-sheriff. Bethel insisted upon the attorney Richard Goodenough, whom Cornish openly distrusted as hostile to the government. He was also offended by Bethel's much ridiculed frugality in office, insisting that he would, during his shrievalty, provide the accustomed hospitality. Politically, however, the two sheriffs were partners and tribunes of the civic whig movement and regarded themselves as accountable to the electors who chose them. They were quite useful to Shaftesbury and the parliamentary whigs because they impanelled the urban juries with an eye towards the prosecution of those accused of complicity in the Popish Plot. They also co-operated in an unsuccessful scheme to grant the civic freedom to Shaftesbury and the duke of Buckingham so that they might, in time, assume magisterial office in London.<br>
<br>In 1681 Cornish was instrumental in securing the deposition of the Irish informant, Edward Fitzharris, with whose fanciful revelations Shaftesbury hoped to revive fears about Catholic plotting. He was faulted by fellow whigs for immediately informing the king about Fitzharris's information. When the crown sought to silence Fitzharris through a treason prosecution Cornish and Bethel delayed summoning a jury. According to Cornish's testimony at the trial, Charles had told him that Fitzharris was actually employed by the court. After being condemned Fitzharris charged Cornish and other whigs with suborning his evidence about plotting, but when Cornish and Bethel officiated at Fitzharris's execution they sought to encourage further revelations. Cornish facilitated whig efforts to petition for another parliament after the brief sitting at Oxford in March 1681. He helped select the London jury that threw out the crown's treason case against Stephen College, &#145;the protestant joiner&#146;. After the crown's unsuccessful treason prosecution of Shaftesbury, Cornish was said to be collecting depositions for ministerial impeachments.<br>
<br>Cornish was similarly visible in the controverted events of 1682&#150;3 in which the crown recovered control of the corporation of London. In January 1682 he was named to the committee to defend the civic charter against the crown's <i>quo warranto</i>, and he was one of the whig aldermen who refused to co-operate in legal actions against conventiclers. An organizer for whig candidates Thomas Papillon and John Dubois during the protracted shrieval election of 1682, he was indicted, with other leading civic whigs, for a riot. When tory sheriffs supported by the crown were declared elected by the loyalist lord mayor, despite a poll that favoured their rivals, Cornish protested. He told the lord mayor that the citizens would not be &#145;baffled&#146; by such &#145;encroachments on their privileges&#146; or &#145;suffer an Arbitrary unjust one to Rule&#146; in London  (Library of Congress, London newsletters, 8.121, 28 Sept 1682). But Cornish himself was baffled in the ensuing election for a new lord mayor: he and a whig colleague headed a poll for the office only to see the court of aldermen adjust the results in favour of loyalist Sir William Prichard.<br>
<br>Cornish was present at strategy sessions throughout 1682 in which civic and parliamentary whigs discussed responses to what they perceived as Charles's infringements upon electoral rights. He was, for instance, a late arrival at a gathering in November 1682 at the home of merchant Thomas Shepherd where the duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, Lord Grey, Robert Ferguson, and Colonel John Rumsey apparently discussed an urban insurrection that was subsequently aborted. In April 1683 Cornish met Thomas Papillon and John Dubois just before his former assistant, Richard Goodenough, arrested Lord Mayor Prichard for failing to respond to a whig suit on behalf of Papillon and Dubois as the legitimate sheriffs. Goodenough had earlier been privy to a scheme to assassinate Charles II, restore parliamentary government, and get Cornish made mayor of London. In May 1683 Cornish was fined 1000 marks after he and his whig colleagues were found guilty of riot in the 1682 shrieval election. Undaunted, he toured the clothing towns of Wiltshire and eastern Somerset, where he was met by enthusiastic crowds and looked into purchasing an interest in the parliamentary borough of Hindon.<br>
<br>Cornish was implicated in some of the revelations about whig plotting that were heard before the privy council during the summer of 1683. He was apprehended four times in the next two years, once on suspicion of distributing pamphlets that suggested the earl of Essex had been murdered by the government, and again during Monmouth's rebellion against James II. The capture of Richard Goodenough after Monmouth's rebellion sealed his fate: the crown now had another witness willing to support Colonel John Rumsey's claim that Cornish had been involved in the conspiracies against Charles II's life in 1682&#150;3. Arrested and found guilty in a hasty trial, he was executed on 23 October 1685, before his Cheapside house. He was comforted by Dr Benjamin Calamy, the vicar of his parish, who had sought to save him, and Cornish claimed from the scaffold that &#145;the crimes laid to my charge were falsely and maliciously sworn against me by the witnesses&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 11.451). James eventually granted Cornish's estate and his remains, which were displayed over Guildhall and the city gates, to his widow, Elizabeth, and to his children. He was buried at St Lawrence Jewry in November 1687. An inventory drawn up after his death included more than a hundred accounts with credits and debts amounting to &pound;87,000, a figure that indicates the considerable scale of his business.<br>
<br>Although lords Grey and Howard regarded Cornish as a plot participant, most of his whig contemporaries regarded him as the victim of judicial murder. Robert Ferguson and Thomas Shepherd insisted that he was not yet present when rebellion was discussed at Shepherd's house in November 1682. What he knew about subsequent whig conspiracy is unclear. Some plotters regarded him as too cautious, and some exiles doubted his commitment to their cause. Gilbert Burnet regarded Cornish as &#145;a plain, warm, honest man&#146; who was manifestly innocent  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.248). The circumstances of his death secured his place in the pantheon of whig martyrs that included Algernon Sidney and Lord Russell. His attainder for treason was reversed after the revolution of 1688, and the foreman of his trial jury was burnt in effigy by a London crowd in December 1689. His London son of the same name followed him in business, held a government place under William III, and was briefly MP for Shaftesbury in Dorset.<br>
