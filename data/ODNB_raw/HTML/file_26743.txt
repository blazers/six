</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stukeley,  William</span>  (1687&#150;1765), <span class="occ">antiquary and natural philosopher</span>, was born on 7 November 1687 in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, the eldest son in the family of four boys and one girl of John Stukeley (<i>d</i>. 1705), attorney, and his wife, Frances Bullen (<i>d</i>. 1707), daughter of Robert Bullen of Weston, Lincolnshire (whom Stukeley erroneously believed to be of the family of Anne Boleyn).<h2>
<a name="Educationandadmissiontothelearnedsocieties"></a>Education and admission to the learned societies</h2>Stukeley showed an early interest in and skill for map making and drawing, and was educated from the age of five under Edward Kelsall at the Free School, Holbeach. In 1700 he left school and was apprenticed as a clerk in his father's law firm in Holbeach, occasionally travelling with him to the law courts in London. But he was more interested in books, natural philosophy, and antiquities than the law, and in 1703 he was admitted as a student at Bene't College (the nickname at that time for Corpus Christi College), Cambridge, where he studied medicine. There he showed a keen interest in botany, Newtonian natural philosophy, and astronomy; he designed and built an early form of orrery with his friend Stephen Hales. Although his studies were interrupted by the death of both his father and his uncle in 1705 and subsequent financial difficulties, he left Cambridge in 1708 after graduating as bachelor of medicine, and moved to London, where he lived at his father's former lodgings in Staples Inn. There he studied anatomy in Chancery Lane, and medicine under Dr Richard Mead at St Thomas's Hospital, Southwark. In 1710 he moved to Boston, Lincolnshire, where he practised as a physician, and was made a freeman of the town in 1713. During his time in Boston he joined the Gentlemen's Society of Spalding, and became a close friend of its founder, Maurice Johnson.<br>
<br>In 1717 Stukeley left Boston and returned to London, where he would live at a house in Ormond Street until 1726. These ten years were intellectually and socially the most interesting in his long life, for his friends included such prominent figures as Richard Mead, Hans Sloane, Edmond Halley, William Whiston, and Martin Folkes, as well as aristocrats such as the earl of Pembroke and the earl of Winchilsea. A major influence, though, was the friendship he made with Sir Isaac Newton, who was by then president of the Royal Society. Stukeley became a fellow of the Royal Society on 20 March 1718, was elected to its council, and stood creditably as a candidate for Halley's successor as secretary in November 1721. On a number of occasions Stukeley visited and conversed alone with Newton, during which time they discussed various subjects, including astronomy, physiology, and chronological history. On one of these visits, as they sat in his garden drinking tea, Newton informed Stukeley that his speculations upon the theory of gravitation had been &#145;occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood. Why sh[oul]d it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths center?&#146;  (Royal Society of London, Stukeley MS 142 fols. 15&#150;16). This was the earliest record of this now famous anecdote. Stukeley was greatly influenced by Newtonian natural philosophy, and wrote and presented papers at the Royal Society defending the religious orthodoxy of the new science, for instance showing that fossils were evidence of a universal deluge. He also supported and expanded upon Newton's belief that the ancients had recognized the heliocentric nature of the universe and had understood the inverse-square rule of gravity.<br>
<br>In 1719 Stukeley travelled to Cambridge and took the degree of MD on 7 July, and on 30 September 1720 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, where he gave the Goulstonian lecture in 1722. This was later published as <span class="italic">Of the Spleen, its Description and History, Uses and Diseases</span> (1722), and included as an appendix the report of the dissection of an elephant Stukeley had made with Sir Hans Sloane. In 1720 &#145;curiosity led him to be initiated into the mysterys of Masonry, suspecting it to be the remains of the mysterys of the antients&#146;  (<span class="italic">Family Memoirs of the Rev. William Stukeley</span>, 1.267), and on 27 December 1721 he was constituted as a grand master. He was also a founder member of the re-established Society of Antiquaries in January 1718, and was appointed as the society's first secretary. His manuscript histories of the society were later used by the antiquary Richard Gough. At this time he made two of his closest lifelong friendships, with the antiquarian brothers Roger and Samuel Gale, who travelled to Avebury in Wiltshire with him in 1719. He also travelled the length of Hadrian's Wall with Roger Gale in 1725 and in November 1757 brought the destruction of the wall by the government's military road builders to the attention of the Society of Antiquaries. He regularly attended meetings of both the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society, where he presented papers and &#145;curious&#146; objects, often antiquarian or philosophical material resulting from the annual perambulations around the English counties that he had been making since 1711. These journeys and observations resulted in his second major publication, <span class="italic">Itinerarium curiosum, or, An account of the antiquitys and remarkable curiositys in nature or art, observ'd in travels thro' Great Brittan, illustrated with copper prints: centuria 1</span> (1724). A second volume, <span class="italic">Centuria II</span>, was published posthumously in London in 1776.<br>
<br>In July 1722 Stukeley became involved with a group of friends in the foundation of a new antiquarian club, the Society of Roman Knights, devoted to the classical rather than medieval or &#145;gothic&#146; past that dominated the interests of the Society of Antiquaries. Stukeley declared that its aim was &#145;to adorn &amp; preserve the truly noble Monuments of the Romans in Britain, &amp; the truley great &amp; stupendous works of our British Ancestors &hellip;&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. c.401 fol. 19). The society's proposed members included Lord Pembroke and Lord Winchilsea, Samuel Buck, Martin Folkes, Roger and Samuel Gale, Alexander Gordon, and Maurice Johnson. In a novel development for an eighteenth-century learned society, Stukeley's first wife, Frances, was also later admitted, so becoming the first woman to belong to an English antiquarian society. The members all assumed nicknames for themselves taken from the Roman or Celtic past. Stukeley took the name of Chyndonax, supposedly a Gaulish druid, and his and his friends' use of this pseudonym would out-survive the short-lived society.<h2>
<a name="Medicinemarriageandordination"></a>Medicine, marriage, and ordination</h2>In 1726 Stukeley left London to pursue a medical practice in Grantham, Lincolnshire, a decision seemingly based on his natural affection for the countryside and concern for his health, for he suffered periodically from gout, a new remedy for which affliction he later promoted in his <span class="italic">Of the Gout</span> (1735). He had some involvement in local politics, and supported the whig cause, dining on occasion with Robert Walpole. While in Grantham he gathered biographical material on Isaac Newton, who had grown up in the town. Much of this material focused on Newton's childhood, and thus has been of particular interest to Newtonian scholars. In Grantham he met Frances Williamson (1696/7&#150;1737), daughter of Robert Williamson of Allington, Lincolnshire, and they married in 1728. They had three daughters before Frances died in 1737.<br>
<br>It was Stukeley's desire for a more settled life that allowed him to continue his researches into the history of religion, and this, together with the encouragement of his friend William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, led to his ordination in the Church of England on 20 July 1729. In 1730 he moved to his living of All Saints', Stamford. The demands of this ecclesiastical position were neither as onerous nor as unpredictable as those of medicine, and he was able to pursue his twin interests of gardening (he landscaped and planted in the gardens of all his homes), and reading and writing on religious antiquities.<h2>
<a name="Stonecircles"></a>Stone circles</h2>While a brief glance through his bibliography of works shows that Stukeley published variously and extensively over much of his adult life, his principal publishing achievement was two monographs on the ancient stone circles of Stonehenge and Avebury in Wiltshire: <span class="italic">Stonehenge: a Temple Restor'd to the British Druids</span> (1740) and <span class="italic">Abury: a Temple of the British Druids</span> (1743). These volumes resulted from the extensive fieldwork&#151;including notes, sketches, drawings, and measurements&#151;that he had made at both sites during the summers between 1718 and 1724. As early as 1724 he had proposed the publication of four books on the history and religion of the ancient Celts, but it was only these two volumes which ever appeared in print, under the collective title of <span class="italic">Patriarchal Christianity, or, A chronological history of the origin and progress of true religion, and of idolatry</span>. The likely cause of the delay in publication was financial as much as scholarly: in terms of sales <span class="italic">Itinerarium curiosum</span> had not been a success, for illustrated books were expensive to produce, and Stukeley subsequently held a low opinion of publishers. But his second marriage, in 1739, to Elizabeth Gale (1687&#150;1757), sister of Roger and Samuel and daughter of the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10298/', "Thomas Gale (1635/6&#150;1702)")</script>, dean of York, and Barbara Pepys (<i>d</i>. 1689), included a sizeable wedding portion (&pound;10,000) and gave him the financial wherewithal to support his publications without worrying about earnings.<br>
<br>Stukeley's <span class="italic">Abury</span> and <span class="italic">Stonehenge</span> are both remarkable for the detail of their illustrations, and the new discoveries he made at the sites. At Stonehenge he was the first to discover and name the neighbouring earthwork avenue and cursus, to identify the stones' astronomical alignment, and he coined the word &#145;trilithon&#146; to describe their unique construction. At Avebury he made important and extensive surveys of the stone circles and avenues at a time when they were being destroyed for building materials, and identified the site as a &#145;dracontium&#146; or serpent-temple. This imaginative but erroneous interpretation&#151;based upon Egyptian hieroglyphs of a snake passing through a circle&#151;was to remain influential through the nineteenth century. It was John Aubrey who had first suggested that the stone circles abundant in the British Isles had been built by the ancient British priests the druids, but it was the publications of Stukeley, and his Cornish correspondent William Borlase, which established the popular association of stone temples with druids in the public imagination. Some of his theories on patriarchal British druids influenced the work of William Blake, especially his <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>. But at a time when other contemporary writers were suggesting Roman, Danish, or even Anglo-Saxon builders for these antiquities, Stukeley's argument was by no means as na&iuml;ve as some later historians have implied. He was well read in contemporary authors on the history of religion, and he intended his work to combat deism and Arianism, both heterodoxies circulating in England in the first half of the century. His writing reveals the influence of writers such as Gerard Vossius, Athanasius Kircher, Ralph Cudworth, and Bishop Edward Stillingfleet, although his own religious beliefs and historical arguments often came close to the natural religion he aimed to counter. An important friendship at this time was with William Warburton, bishop of Gloucester and author of the influential anti-deistic tract <span class="italic">The Divine Legation of Moses</span>. Stukeley continued to publish works on British antiquities in his three-volume series <span class="italic">Palaeographica Britannica</span> (1743, 1746, 1752), the first volume of which contained his account of the Royston cave, discovered in 1742.<h2>
<a name="TheBrazenNoseSociety"></a>The Brazen Nose Society</h2>Stukeley particularly enjoyed the company of those who shared his intellectual interests, and while loathing the bustle and pollution of London, he missed the fraternity of like minds which it offered. In an attempt to overcome this isolation, in the summer of 1736 he founded a literary and antiquarian society in Stamford. In 1334 the town had briefly been the refuge of a group of secessionist scholars from Oxford who brought with them the brass knocker which gave its name to Brasenose College. The original knocker remained in the town until 1890 and Stukeley utilized this piece of local history, naming his new club the Brazen Nose Society. Modelled on the Gentlemen's Society of Spalding, its purpose was to provide &#145;a weekly conference for the promoting of useful learning sacred &amp; civil, [and] the knowledg of antiquitys &amp; nature&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. e.122). Stukeley set about making the first attempt to interpret Stamford's topographical history, and his society's meetings included a demonstration of &#145;Philosophical experiments&#146; with an air-pump, a microscope, and a magic lantern by William Whiston, the disgraced former Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge. Although at one point there were up to thirty members, the society soon lapsed, and an attempted revival in 1745 was unsuccessful. In 1738 Stukeley also established a clergyman's book club in the town, &#145;with [the] intent of making it a Vertuoso Club, but it prov'd absolutely abortive: for they had no taste for anything but wine &amp; tobacco&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. e.128 fol. 4). Despite the &#145;solitude&#146; he complained of in Stamford, he was able to spend his winters in London, and on 11 December 1741 he participated in Lord Sandwich's foundation of the Egyptian Society at the Lebeck's Head tavern, Chandos Street  (<span class="italic">Family Memoirs of the Rev. William Stukeley</span>, 1.470). Unfortunately, this society was also short-lived, but Stukeley made there a close and influential new friend and patron, John Montagu, second duke of Montagu. He became a regular visitor to Montagu's country seat at Boughton, Northamptonshire.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>In November 1747 Montagu offered Stukeley the living of St George the Martyr in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, which, given his frustration with Stamford's provinciality, he accepted. He spent the final years of his life in London, where once more he was able regularly to attend the meetings of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. It was these final years which did most to cloud Stukeley's reputation, when as an old man he enthused about his patriarchal druids, warranting him his self-appointed nickname the Arch Druid. But he continued to be interested in natural philosophical subjects, and attempted to explain the earthquake that shook London in the spring of 1750 through the medium of electricity. His essay <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Earthquakes, Natural and Religious</span> (1750) was based on papers he read at the Royal Society (which were also reprinted in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, vol. 46) and a sermon given at his church. In the essay Stukeley noted his debt to Benjamin Franklin's recent experiments with lightning, which had been communicated to the Royal Society. Horace Walpole recorded in his correspondence how &#145;One Stukeley, a parson, has accounted for it [the earthquake], and I think prettily, by electricity. But that is the fashionable cause, and everything is resolved into electrical appearances&#146;  (H. Walpole, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. W. S. Lewis, 20, 1960, 154).<br>
<br>In 1747 Stukeley received a letter from a young Englishman named Charles Bertram, resident in Copenhagen, informing him of his discovery of a medieval copy of a previously unknown Roman map and itinerary of Britain, allegedly made by a fourteenth-century monk of Westminster. Stuart Piggott has described this episode as &#145;one of the most audacious and successful literary forgeries of the eighteenth century&#146;  (Piggott, <span class="italic">William Stukeley: an Eighteenth-Century Antiquary</span>, 127). Although Stukeley attempted to purchase the (non-existent) manuscript of <span class="italic">De situ Britanniae</span> for the newly opened British Museum, the amicable correspondence between him and Bertram did lead to the publication of Stukeley's <span class="italic">An Account of Richard of Cirencester, Monk of Westminster, and of his Works</span> (1757) and Bertram's <span class="italic">Britannicarum gentium historiae antiquae scriptores tres</span> (1757, including authentic works by Gildas and Nennius). Bertram's forgery as disseminated in these two books was a great success, and <span class="italic">De situ</span> was considered an authentic source for Roman Britain (it was even used in part by Edward Gibbon). The forgery was not fully discredited until 1869. Although Stukeley was an unfortunate dupe in this episode, his nineteenth-century reputation suffered additionally from his defence in 1763 of the Scottish poet James Macpherson. Macpherson had published three collections of poems purporting to be authentic translations of the work of an ancient Gaelic poet, Ossian. Although the poems were hugely popular throughout Europe, Samuel Johnson declared his scepticism and opinion was divided on the extent of their authenticity.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1765 Stukeley suffered &#145;a stroke of the palsy&#146; at his rectory in Queen Square, and after lying in a coma for three days he died there on 3 March 1765. He was buried in an unmarked grave in East Ham churchyard, Essex. Stukeley was a warm-hearted and generous man who valued intellectual curiosity and personal piety over the temporal riches which, as a well-connected London physician in the 1720s, could have been his. Often, and probably unfairly, considered an eccentric, he was reluctant to practise the circumspection necessary in the study of prehistory, to temper his imagination, or to take the more cautionary advice of friends. However, his unstinted enthusiasm, dedication, and keen eye merited him his position as the father of British field archaeology.<br>
