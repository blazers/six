<span class="headword">Constable,  Robert</span>  (late 1450s&#150;1501), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the second son of Sir Robert Constable (<i>d</i>. 1488) of Flamborough, Yorkshire, and Gray's Inn, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6108/', "Sir Marmaduke Constable (d. 1518)")</script>, who inherited the Flamborough estate and whom he followed to Lincoln's Inn in 1477. Unlike his brothers, he persevered with the law, and in 1489 became a bencher of his inn. His 1489 reading was given on the first two chapters of <span class="roman">Westminster I</span> and includes an account of the law concerning entails, which, though full of precise and ingenious learning, was sufficiently traditional to omit all mention of the recently invented common recovery. In 1494 he delivered his second reading, probably on the <span class="roman">Statute of <i>Quo warranto</i></span>. Soon afterwards he received his writ to become a serjeant-at-law and, since it was the custom for the junior serjeant-elect to deliver a reading, he gave a third course of lectures in Lincoln's Inn in 1495. Like Thomas Frowyk (<i>d</i>. 1506), his brother graduand in the Inner Temple, he chose the pseudo-statute <span class="italic">Prerogativa regis</span>, which he expounded in copious detail. This reading was printed in 1949, but only as far as the seventh chapter of the statute; more remains in manuscript. Constable seems to have avoided major royal office, though he was a justice of the peace and served as a member of the council of Lord Scrope of Upsale. In 1501 he was commissioned as a justice of assize and rode the western circuit. Doubtless he could have expected a permanent justiceship in the near future, but he died a relatively young man on 22 November of that year.<br>
<br>In 1490, Constable married Beatrice, widow of Ralph, Lord Greystoke (<i>d</i>. 1487), whose maiden name was Hawtcliff. The marriage is alluded to in his serjeant's reading, where he mentions his wife's suit for dower against Lord Dacre of Gilsland as committee of the lands of Lord Greystoke's heir. Besides enjoying the dower lands, his professional income enabled him to make substantial purchases in south-east Yorkshire. In 1497 and 1498 he paid 800 marks to Sir Thomas Lovell for the manors of Newsham and Broughton. He was also, according to his will, a parishioner of Holme on Spalding Moor. But his principal seat was established at North Cliffe, in the parish of Sancton, where his descendants remained until 1695.<br>
<br>Constable's widow, Beatrice, took the veil in 1502 and died in 1505; she was buried at Sancton. They left two sons, Marmaduke and Robert, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Jane. The elder son, Marmaduke (<i>d</i>. 1525), is not be confused with a contemporary Marmaduke Constable (<i>d</i>. 1545), the son of the serjeant's brother Marmaduke, nor yet with a fourth person of the same name (<i>d</i>. 1560), who was the son of Sir Robert Constable (<i>d</i>. 1537). Marmaduke, not quite twelve years of age in 1501, was left &pound;20 by his father for his exhibition at Cambridge for three years from the age of fifteen, and &pound;24 for a further three years at inn of chancery. His mother left him another 10 marks to support him at Cambridge, and &pound;10 for five years &#145;in the courtt and chancery&#146;. In the event, he took up a military career, and fought against the Scots. He died in his thirties and left his law books to his younger brother, Robert. One of the Constable law books is now in the Bodleian Library, an important manuscript containing fifteenth-century year-books.<br>
