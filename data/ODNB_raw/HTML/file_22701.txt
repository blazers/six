<span class="headword">Pratt, Sir  John</span>  (1657&#150;1725), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Oxford, the son of Richard Pratt (1629&#150;1692) and his first wife, Elizabeth Skaye (<i>d</i>. before 1662). The family had been adversely affected by adherence to the royalist cause in the civil wars, Pratt's grandfather John Pratt (<i>d</i>. 1673) being forced to sell Carswell Priory in Devon. Pratt was educated at Oxford at Magdalen Hall (1673) and Wadham College (1674); he graduated BA in 1676, became a fellow of Wadham in 1678, and proceeded MA in 1679. While at Oxford he became associated with the whig cause, being reproved in a local coffee house for proposing a toast &#145;to the confusion of all popish princes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 2.497&#150;8) and when challenged specifically citing the duke of York. He entered the Inner Temple in 1675 and was called to the bar in 1682. Henceforth he pursued a legal career, first in London, until he reputedly fell foul of Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, and then in Exeter. On 17 November 1683 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1705), daughter and coheir of Henry Gregory, rector of Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire. They had five sons and four daughters. He later married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1728), daughter of Hugh Wilson, vicar of Trefeglwys, Monmouthshire, and canon of Bangor. They had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Following the revolution of 1688 Pratt made steady progress in his profession, and was chosen by the attorney-general, Sir Thomas Trevor, as one of the crown's counsel before the House of Lords during the trial for high treason of the Jacobite conspirator Sir John Fenwick. The leading whig lawyer, Lord Keeper Sir John Somers, approached Sir George Treby, chief justice of common pleas: &#145;I know your Lordship has a favour for him, and therefore I hope you will send for him and advise him what he is to say, and how he is to manage himself in that place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fitzherbert MSS</span>, 44). Pratt duly appeared before the Lords in December, although he may have found the experience somewhat daunting as in 1702 Bishop Nicolson recollected him &#145;swooning&#146; during the trial. Thenceforth Pratt appeared intermittently as counsel before the Lords, most notably in June 1698 against the passage of the bill settling the trade to the East Indies, until 1704 when his appearances began to increase markedly. His legal talent was recognized on 1 October 1700 when he was made a serjeant-at-law. Pratt made his first significant land purchase, the estate at Wildernesse (formerly Stidulfe's Place), Kent, which was sold pursuant to a private act passed in 1704. By 1705 his reputation was such that he was grouped among the &#145;great counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.176). On 3 December 1708 he appeared before the Commons as counsel for the petitioners in the case of the right of the eldest sons of Scottish representative peers to sit in the Commons. With an enhanced profile among the Scots in the following January he was counsel before the Lords over the objection made to the duke of Dover's (Queensberry) voting in the elections for Scottish representative peers. On 17 January 1710 the House of Lords approved Pratt's appointment as counsel for the outspoken tory cleric Dr Henry Sacheverell, who was being impeached by the Commons, but one week later Pratt withdrew from the case owing to Sacheverell's determination to milk the situation for the political advantage of the tories. Pratt's withdrawal may have hindered his chances of securing a seat at Marlborough in the general election held in the following autumn.<br>
<br>In December 1711 Pratt was again embroiled as counsel in a matter of great significance for the Scots: the eligibility of the duke of Hamilton to sit in the Lords by virtue of his patent as duke of Brandon. Although Bishop Burnet described him as &#145;one of the most able advocates of that time&#146;, Pratt was content to play second fiddle to Sir Thomas Powys in arguing Hamilton's case. On 28 December 1711 Pratt was elected to parliament in a by-election for Midhurst, a seat he owed to the whiggish duke of Somerset. Pratt's career in the Commons was low key, although in January 1712 he exerted himself in defence of the duke of Marlborough who was under attack for corruption. Indeed, in April it was rumoured that should Marlborough be prosecuted through the courts then Pratt would be one of his counsel. Pratt contributed to the whig cause outside the Commons in February 1713 when he joined an array of distinguished whig lawyers in the defence of the journalist George Ridpath for articles which appeared in the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span>. Pratt added to his landed estates in 1714, as a result of a private act authorizing the sale of Bayham Priory on the Sussex&#150;Kent border.<br>
<br>The Hanoverian succession saw a resurgence in Pratt's fortunes. His knighthood (11 October 1714) was the precursor of his appointment as a justice of king's bench (20 November). In April&#150;May 1718 he served for twenty-five days as a commissioner of the great seal in the hiatus following Lord Cowper's resignation, and following Parker's assumption of the chancellorship he succeeded him as lord chief justice (19 May 1718). He became a privy councillor on 9 October 1718. Pratt's first significant case concerned the claim by George I to control the education and marriage of members of the royal family. Pratt found that as the crown had an undoubted right in respect of marriage it &#145;is a natural and necessary consequence&#146; that it also had the care of their education  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 15.1216). In 1721 Pratt stepped into the breach following the resignation of John Aislabie as chancellor of the exchequer following the South Sea Bubble crisis, and held the office for longer than the usual period of a few days. In November 1722 he presided over the trial for treason of Christopher Layer, acquiring a certain reputation for harshness in keeping the prisoner in chains. Indeed, upon sentencing Layer he thought the accused's crimes even more heinous because of his legal training, which ought to have brought him to a proper understanding of &#145;the excellency of our happy constitution and government&#146;  (ibid., 16.320). Pratt also presided over the cause between Richard Bentley and Cambridge University, which saw him resist pressure from the whig ministry to protect one of Bentley's whig antagonists, John Colbatch. Pratt died on 24 February 1725 at his house in Ormond Street, London, death depriving him of the chancellorship which Parker was soon to relinquish. His heir was John, the fourth son from his first marriage. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22699/', "Charles Pratt")</script>, his son from his second marriage, became lord chancellor and was created Lord Camden. Jane, his daughter from his second marriage, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12272/', "Nicholas Hardinge")</script>, while Anna Maria, the third daughter of this marriage, married Thomas Barrett Lennard, sixteenth Lord Dacre.<br>
