<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cardus, Sir  (John Frederick) Neville</span>  (1888&#150;1975), <span class="occ">writer on cricket and music critic</span>, was born on 3 April 1888 at 4 Summer Place, Rusholme, Manchester, the illegitimate child of Ada Cardus (1870&#150;1954). His forenames were registered as John Frederick. His father may have been John Frederick Newsham (<i>b</i>. 1867), whom the seventeen-year-old Ada married three months later, on 14 July 1888. The marriage, however, did not last long, and the description of Newsham as a &#145;smith&#146; hardly fitted Cardus's own comment that his father may have been &#145;one of the first violins in an orchestra&#146;  (Cardus, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 15). The boy lived with his maternal grandparents. Robert Cardus, his grandfather, had a policeman's pension, Ann Cardus took in washing, and the household finances were augmented through the activities of Ada (who briefly returned home) and her sister Beatrice as prostitutes.<br>
<br>Yet the home was not quite the slum Cardus suggested and, even for the poor, the community of Rusholme, in late nineteenth-century Manchester, offered cultural expression in its cosmopolitan nature, free libraries, and music-halls. The young Cardus took what he could from his working-class background, learning to read and write at the board school in Rusholme, using the libraries and his grandfather's <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and getting his taste for music as a chocolate seller in the Comedy Theatre. Variously, he had delivered his grandmother's washing, boiled type in a printer's business, and driven a carpenter's handcart before, in 1904, he had become a clerk in an insurance agency with the Fleming brothers, benevolent employers who encouraged him in his self-education and would let him off to watch cricket at Old Trafford. This was the time when he acquired his deep affection for Lancashire cricket and for the game's &#145;golden age&#146;. He remained indebted to the Flemings, who for eight years (1904&#150;12) &#145;stood between me and destitution&#146;  (Cardus, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 41).<br>
<br>Great literature, especially Dickens, and philosophy had their place in Cardus's grandiose pursuit of culture, but it was music which mattered most. He attended concerts at the Free Trade Hall and heard the first performance of Elgar's first symphony on 3 December 1908. He saw Sir Thomas Beecham conduct <span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span>, and his own first musical criticism, &#145;Bantock and style&#146;, appeared in the monthly <span class="italic">Musical Opinion</span> in 1912.<br>
<br>Yet in music, unlike cricket, Cardus was no performer (though he briefly took singing lessons) and it was his cricket in that same year (1912) which gave him his first opportunity. On the strength of his figures as an off-break bowler in Manchester league cricket, he successfully applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School. When war broke out in 1914, he volunteered for service but his poor eyesight brought rejection. The headmaster, C. A. Alington, was aware of his unusual interests&#151;he had spotted him reading Euripides in translation&#151;and appointed him as his secretary. The idyll of Cardus's four years at Shrewsbury&#151;&#145;because of Alington, I call myself an Old Salopian&#146;  (Cardus, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 81)&#151;ended when Alington went to Eton. He was willing to take his secretary, but only if he could be assured that Cardus would not be conscripted.<br>
<br>C. P. Scott, editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, took the persistent 28-year-old into his office&#151;just as Alington had done&#151;as a secretary. By 1917 Cardus was learning the all-round trade of reporting and briefly writing on drama and music. Two years later he reported his first cricket match. Throughout the inter-war period readers of the &#145;<i>M. G.</i>&#146; would be avid followers of N. C. on music and Cricketer on cricket.<br>
<br>Security (although all his life he was fearful of being poor again) allowed Cardus to marry, on 17 June 1921, Edith Honorine Watton King (1887/8&#150;1968), a schoolmistress, daughter of John Thomas Sissons King, schoolmaster. He gave his father's name (perhaps for respectability) as Frederick Cardus. There were no children. At about this time Cardus, who had always been known as Fred, adopted the name Neville, which alone appeared on his marriage certificate. His twin interests, at their lowest, now ensured &#145;a balance at the bank&#146;  (Cardus, <span class="italic">Second Innings</span>, 87).<br>
<br>Cricket, even more than music, provided the medium through which Cardus could display his treasure house of literary knowledge and satisfy his aesthetic appreciation of grace and movement. Neither his account of his marriage nor that shortly afterwards, of his one great scoop&#151;A. C. MacLaren's eleven beating the 1921 all-conquering Australians, with Cardus the only major journalist present&#151;stands microscopic examination. Both show his abilities in embellishing the non-essentials to make a well-told tale.<br>
<br>Cardus was essentially a writer with a talent for handling words, presenting balanced and harmonious prose, and drawing on his deep reservoir of reading. Above all, he wrote for others' enjoyment because he enjoyed writing. Cricket and music were the chosen media through which he expressed himself. The one gave him the greater fame, the other the greater satisfaction. In his approach to both he sought to understand the emotions which lay behind the technical performances. He was a romantic in the sense that he paid more attention to the spirit and beauty of what he saw and heard than to the mechanics of endeavour and achievement.<br>
<br>In his cricket writing Cardus was an innovator. On what had been, in earlier hands, a descriptive and narrative enterprise, he imposed criticism. To the sights and sounds of the game he brought his own use of imagery, metaphor, and allusion, with which he created a mythology of characters and scenes. But elegance and wit redeemed him from pomposity.<br>
<br>Cricketers took on the guise of characters: Macartney, Figaro; MacLaren, Don Quixote; Spooner's batting matched the poetry of Herrick. Yet none of this imagery gainsaid Cardus's ability to analyse. Of Wilfred Rhodes he wrote: &#145;Flight was his secret, flight and the curving line, now higher, now lower, tempting, inimical &hellip; every ball a decoy and one of them&#151;ah, which?&#151;the master ball&#146;  (Cardus, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 158).<br>
<br>In commercial terms Cardus was an immediate success. He doubled the summer sales of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and, as early as 1922, a publisher had given permanency to his reports in <span class="italic">A Cricketer's Book</span>. There followed <span class="italic">Days in the Sun</span> (1924), <span class="italic">The Summer Game</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Good Days</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Australian Summer</span> (1937). All were distillations of his 9000 words a week. In the twenty years between the wars he wrote some 2 million of them, even submitting 1200 words on an August bank holiday totally rained off.<br>
<br>In 1927 Cardus succeeded Samuel Longford, as the chief music critic of the <i>M. G.</i> so holding two of the paper's major portfolios. As with cricket, he got to know the performers, notably Beecham and (later) Sir John Barbirolli. Cricket was for watching: Cardus cultivated the art of listening and the ability to interpret for his readers what he heard. The fame he had quickly acquired as a cricket writer came more slowly as a music critic. Even when he had made his name, year by year, with some 4000 words a week, from two or three concerts, he remained aware that a musical error of fact might bring two dozen letters of protest; a cricket one, possibly a thousand. Others, such as his friend and rival Ernest Newman, were already established. What made him different was his total independence of judgement. He could be out of step with his contemporaries and sometimes ahead of them. He wrote intuitively, conveying his own aesthetic delight and putting an essential truth into a telling phrase; Sibelius, for example, composed &#145;mainly in nouns and verbs with eloquent dashes of silence&#146;  (obituary, <span class="italic">Guardian</span>). As in much else in his life, he was &#145;his own man&#146;, as J. B. Priestley called him  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Cardus was ready to champion little-known composers such as Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner&#151;both of them in the central European tradition in which he delighted. Pursuit of that tradition took him to Salzburg, whose festivals provided some of his finest moments. Arturo Toscanini conducting the opera <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span> there in 1936 would &#145;remain in the mind for a lifetime because of its beauty and dignity. The banner of song opened with a width and nobility that caused happiness and sadness. Toscanini held us like children&#146;  (Brookes, 152). Perhaps in the end the danger, in both cricket and music, was that readers came to appreciate the words more than the deeds they portrayed. Yet there were no concessions to the faint-hearted and <i>M. G.</i> readers had to keep up with him. This approach would later cause problems for him in Australia.<br>
<br>In the early years of Cardus's work, Manchester and the Hall&eacute; Orchestra were central to his writing, though some adverse notices in the 1930s during the depression, when audiences fell, caused economic concern to performers. London came to make greater claims on him, while the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 brought an end to his work as both cricket and music critic for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. In 1940 he took himself off to Australia (and there were critics of his decision) to work for the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>.<br>
<br>At first Cardus enraged his readership by the savagery of his attacks. What he viewed as a genuine attempt to raise standards was seen as arrogant and insensitive. Once he had mentally accepted that Sydney was not Salzburg he struck a balance. By 1942 his writing was acceptable and understood, while he made a major cultural impact on Australia with his Sunday evening broadcasts called <span class="italic">Enjoyment of Music</span> and a similar midweek programme for children. With fewer demands on his time and living, at first, a somewhat solitary life in Sydney, he found time to write his <span class="italic">Ten Composers</span> and <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>.<br>
<br>Then, in a period of uncertainty, Cardus travelled between Australia and England five times in two years before finally settling in England in 1949, for the rest of his life. Yet a post-war England was alien to him and he was conscious he had not shared its hardships: &#145;My exile in Australia had disqualified me&#146;  (Cardus, <span class="italic">Full Score</span>, 194). After some false starts, notably with Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in 1948, he returned (1950) to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> as its London music critic, where he wrote &#145;Music surveys&#146;, introducing readers to the music they might be going to hear or at least might read about later. Many of the themes remained endemic to his pre-war interests in the classical tradition, with little concession to modernism. Mahler found an undue place, as a prelude to the analytical study <span class="italic">Gustav Mahler: his Mind and his Music</span>, which he published in 1965.<br>
<br>Another volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">Second Innings</span> (1950), was followed by a third, <span class="italic">Full Score</span> (1970), when Cardus was over eighty. Several of his earlier cricket books were reprinted. He also wrote a biography of Beecham (1961) and edited a memoir on Kathleen Ferrier (1971). His devotion to the singer was so profound that some critics suggested that it precluded his objective judgement of her talent. With Beecham his relationship had had its ups and downs but the book allowed him to dwell on a past in which he more and more took comfort.<br>
<br>Cardus made few forays into the post-war cricket world, although he reported two MCC tours to Australia in the 1950s and the &#145;Ashes&#146; series in England in 1953. <span class="italic">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</span> claimed him for an article virtually every year. He took great pleasure in being elected president of Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1970&#150;71. Other honours had already come his way. He had been appointed CBE in 1964 and became, in 1967, the first music critic to be knighted. In 1972 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music.<br>
<br>The death of Cardus's wife in 1968 ended a marriage which had lasted nearly fifty years. The couple had seldom lived in the same house and both valued the independence which their separate lives gave them. Yet the friendship&#151;it was scarcely intimacy&#151;was sustained by their meals together, letters, and phone calls. After her death he stopped living in his club (the National Liberal) and moved into her flat. Cardus enjoyed the company of ladies (and in particular of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94879/', "Margaret Hughes")</script>, his &#145;cricket wife&#146;, and Else Mayer-Lismann, his &#145;music wife&#146;) and retained to the end of his life an old-world gallantry. He was a gregarious man, with a close circle of friends of both sexes. Good food and wine, talking, and membership of several London clubs were aspects of his lifestyle.<br>
<br>In his final years Cardus still wrote, though the way <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> handled his copy from the Edinburgh festival in 1969 upset him. The days of expansionist writing, untouched by sub-editors, were long since past and his association with the paper of his heyday diminished in happiness at the end. It was an opinion he expressed in Robin Daniels's <span class="italic">Conversations with Cardus</span> (1976).<br>
<br>Sir Neville Cardus died at the Nuffield Clinic, London, on 28 February 1975 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. Despite living to almost eighty-seven, he had changed relatively little from the lean, ascetic figure of moderate height, with sharp features, sleek hair, and strong glasses. The tributes to him as a writer were generous. Intellectually, music had been his first string but cricket had been his passport to fulfilment. And in cricket, if not in music, he had changed the course of reporting. He would have his imitators and parodists, and no serious cricket writer would remain unaffected by him. His last entry in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> (1975) showed something of his enigmatic approach to life: &#145;Recreations: anything not in the form of a game&#146;.<br>
