<span class="headword">Biggs,  Noah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1651), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and social reformer</span>, was active in the 1650s, though his identity and background remain obscure. It is possible that he was Henry Biggs, a surgeon employed at the dockyards of Deptford and Woolwich in 1649&#150;53 to work with his father, Thomas Biggs, who had fallen ill and that &#145;Noah&#146; is a pseudonym stemming from their work environment. The one publication of Noah Biggs, <span class="italic">Mataeotechnia medicinae praxeos: the Vanity of the Craft of Physick</span> (1651), was addressed to the &#145;new commonwealth parliament&#146; which, Biggs underlined, had been ordered by Cromwell to reform the professions. Although one of the introductory poems in the work is signed &#145;R. B. iatrophilos&#146;, the style bears little similarity with the one extant poem of the chemist Robert Boyle, even if Boyle's personal commitment in the period to such causes as open communication of medical receipts cannot be in doubt. On the other hand another introductory poem bears the signature &#145;W. R.&#146;, which may indeed refer to the unlicensed medical doctor William Rand, later the projector of a &#145;College of Graduate Physicians&#146; to rival the established College of Physicians, though no conclusive evidence is available.<br>
<br>Though Biggs has been frequently characterized as a follower of Paracelsus, his work seems more strongly to reflect the teaching of the Flemish chemical physician, J. B. van Helmont, who had modified Paracelsian teachings in significant ways. The spiritually corrupt academicians, argued Biggs, relied on ancient pagan sources for herbal medicines, sterile anatomical investigations, and the dangerous practices of purging and bloodletting. Instead, Biggs advanced the spiritual philosopher's alchemical operations, which focused on the purification of substances by fire, known as the art of pyrotechny.<br>
<br>Biggs's work can be viewed as part of the puritan effort to reform natural philosophy, medicine, and education. It is not known for how long he continued to be involved with the movement for the radical reform of knowledge. If the identification with Henry Biggs is correct, then he seems to have died as early as 1653 (according to the public records, Thomas Biggs was restored as master surgeon to the shipyards in 1653 when his son died). However, this identification has not been definitely confirmed.<br>
