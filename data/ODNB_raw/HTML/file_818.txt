<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Astley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1507&#150;1596), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Astley (<i>d</i>. in or after 1514), landowner, of Hill Morton and Melton Constable, Norfolk, and his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1508), daughter and coheir of John Wood of East Barsham, Norfolk. Nothing certain is known of his early life and education, although it seems probable that he first went to court when he was twelve. He appears to have been well educated: he may have attended Jesus College, Cambridge, and Roger Ascham commended his ability to speak Italian.<br>
<br>Astley's introduction at court was almost certainly engineered by his family, for his mother's sister, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, was Anne Boleyn's aunt. His first recorded office was that of gentleman waiter in the household of Edward, prince of Wales, from 1543, and, as one of the gentlemen &#145;not plased&#146;  (BL, Royal MS 7 Cxvi, fol. 94<i>r</i>), by 1547 he had been given a position in the household of his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8636/', "Princess Elizabeth (1533&#150;1603)")</script>. Ties of blood were reinforced both by his marriage about 1545 to Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1565) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68016/', "Astley, Katherine")</script>], daughter of Sir Philip Champernowne of Modbury, Devon, and his wife, Katherine, and by his protestantism. The couple had no children. Astley is probably best known for his dismissal by the privy council from Elizabeth's service in January 1549, followed by a spell in the Tower of London, for his actions concerning the efforts of the lord admiral, Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley, to marry Elizabeth, although Astley had discouraged his wife's impolitic matchmaking. Both Astleys were soon reinstated. Astley may have spent 1553&#150;4 travelling in Italy but he was back in England in 1555. His wife and he seem to have kept a low profile following Katherine Astley's second dismissal in 1556. Astley himself was MP for Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, in 1547, West Looe, Devon, in March 1553, and St Albans, Hertfordshire, in 1555.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's accession saw the restoration of the Astleys and in December 1558 Astley was made a gentleman of the privy chamber, master of the jewel house, and treasurer of the queen's jewels and plate, posts for which loyalty and a knowledge of the ways of the court were greater qualifications than administrative competence. These offices, especially the latter, brought great financial rewards, including a 5 per cent poundage on all monetary gifts to the queen and a fine set of rooms in each palace. Neither post was a sinecure, however, and he was very much a working member of staff. Indeed, as master of the jewel house Astley could risk financial ruin, for his duties entailed being held personally responsible for any unaccounted losses. The keepership of St James's Palace between 1560 and 1576, held jointly with his wife, while she lived, carried much the same status but left fewer hostages to fortune. Astley was MP for Cricklade, Wiltshire, in 1559, and for Boroughbridge, West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1563, and became a quite active member of committees.<br>
<br>Astley's career was fuelled first by his family and then by his wife, so his actions on the latter's death on 18 July 1565 are revealing. An ambitious man would have been wise to make an equally judicious match within the golden circle of families closest to the queen but instead his choice fell on Margaret Lenton (<i>d</i>. in or after 1596), an illegitimate daughter of Lord Thomas Grey; Astley's court career effectively stalled. He sank back into a comfortable, busy life in the foothills of power, spending less time at court (and managing not to draw attention to himself when he was there) and more in the shires, especially Kent. He managed his estates, held various county offices, including JP for Middlesex and for Kent, and spent surprisingly little time at law, a happy situation that founded the fortunes of the three sons and three daughters of his second marriage. He was MP for Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1571 and 1572, and for Maidstone, Kent, in 1586 and 1589. Perhaps his single most enduring achievement was his book, <span class="italic">The Art of Riding</span>, published in his old age in 1584, the first English treatise on &#145;horsemanship&#146;, based on classical authors and tempered by his own considerable experience. He died on 1 August 1596, probably at Maidstone, solvent and apparently untroubled by his diminished status after the death of his first wife. He had spent the last thirty years of his life among the ranks of Elizabeth's reliable old servants, favoured with office but not trusted with power. Astley was buried in All Saints', Maidstone, on 5 August 1596; he was survived by his second wife, Margaret, who was buried on 22 June 1602, also at All Saints'.<br>
