<span class="headword">Vere,  Henry  de</span>, eighteenth earl of Oxford  (1593&#150;1625), <span class="occ">nobleman and soldier</span>, was the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28208/', "Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford (1550&#150;1604)")</script>, and his second wife, Elizabeth Trentham (<i>d</i>. 1612/13). He was born on 24 February 1593 at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, and inherited his title on 24 June 1604. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in November 1604, and awarded an MA degree at Oxford on 30 August 1605 during a royal visit there. It seems unlikely that the earl absorbed much learning at either place, however, preferring what his mother described in 1611 as &#145;evil courses&#146;. His financial situation was from the beginning precarious; in 1604 King James granted him a &pound;200 pension, and in 1609 his mother, as his guardian, sought a parliamentary bill that would have allowed him to sell part of his estate.<br>
<br>While he was at least occasionally at court&#151;serving as esquire to Prince Charles on his creation as duke of York in 1605, and becoming knight of the Bath at Prince Henry's assumption of the principality of Wales in 1610&#151;Oxford preferred what some described as &#145;debauchery&#146; away from Whitehall. In 1611 the king granted him the keepership of Havering Park, although James worried that he would not preserve the game there. Conflict with his mother, who described him as &#145;younge and nott able to advise himself&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29549, fol. 31), bedevilled his youth, but her death in December 1612 or early January 1613 increased his income and allowed him to embark upon an extended tour of Europe. He remained overseas for over five years, first in the Spanish Netherlands, then France (he was in Paris in 1614), and finally, Venice. In Venice, with the king's approval, Oxford offered to raise 6000 men for the republic's service&#151;an offer the senate declined. While in Venice he was unwarily drawn into a dispute at home. Lady Hatton attempted to derail the planned match of her daughter, Frances Coke, to Sir John Villiers, brother of James's favourite Buckingham, by claiming a pre-contract with Oxford. The king insisted upon the Villiers marriage, and the ploy failed. &#145;He [Oxford] sends word he will come over and see what he must do, but it is doubtful whether her fair face and the large fortune offered will induce him to risk losing the favour of the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>, 482).<br>
<br>Oxford returned to England in October 1618, served in Queen Anne's funeral in May 1619, and in the same month took up his office as hereditary lord great chamberlain. But the European war beckoned, and was more attractive to the earl than a court now dominated by Buckingham. In June 1620 he joined his kinsman Sir Horace Vere as a captain in Vere's regiment. His 250 men were raised, the Venetian ambassador claimed, at Oxford's own expense&#151;although given his poverty this seems a dubious assertion. After only a few months' service he left the Palatinate just before word arrived of the catastrophic defeat of Frederick's army at White Mountain, outside Prague. He landed in England on 11 November.<br>
<br>As a peer with firsthand experience of the war (limited though it was), Oxford was named by James to the council of war which in January and February 1621 considered how to rescue the elector palatine's fortunes. In the first session of the parliament of 1621, armed with two proxies and a feeling that his services were undervalued, he aligned himself with the so-called &#145;noble patriots&#146; opposed to a Spanish match. Oxford spoke rashly about the match, and in July was gaoled for a short time in the Tower. The king suggested that he absent himself from parliament's second session, and then made sure of his absence by appointing him to command a fleet patrolling the English Channel in December. Oxford served at sea until March 1622, but was removed from command following another imbroglio with Buckingham. This time he unwisely intervened in the marriage of another Villiers brother, Christopher, to Elizabeth Norreys. He &#145;hoped the time would come when justice would be free, and not pass only through Buckingham's hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1619&#150;23</i>, 328). For this Oxford once again went to the Tower. This time James was incensed and directed the attorney-general to prepare a Star Chamber prosecution. Held a close prisoner for twenty months, repeated efforts to gain Oxford's release failed due to the king's intransigence. Finally, on 30 December 1623, he was freed, thanks to the good offices of Prince Charles and Buckingham, hoping to smooth the waters before the upcoming parliamentary session. The duke further ingratiated himself with Oxford by supporting his planned match with Lady Diana (1596&#150;1654), daughter of William Cecil, second earl of Exeter. Lady Diana's beauty was matched by her &pound;30,000 fortune, and the two were married as soon as Oxford was released, on 1 January 1624. Now reconciled&#151;at least outwardly&#151;to the royal favourite, in May 1624 Oxford took command of a regiment in the elector palatine's service in the Low Countries. There, in late May, he received a slight wound in his left arm in action before Terheiden. The injury evidently became infected, for he died of a fever at The Hague between 2 and 9 June 1625 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 15 July 1625. He left no children, and was succeeded by his second cousin Robert de Vere, nineteenth earl of Oxford.<br>
