<span class="headword">Donaldson,  James</span>  (1751&#150;1830), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and philanthropist</span>, was born on 3 December 1751 at 7 West Bow, Edinburgh, and baptized the same day. He was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64278/', "Alexander Donaldson (bap. 1727, d. 1794)")</script>, an Edinburgh bookseller, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall. In 1763 his father opened a bookshop in London that took advantage of copyright differences between Scotland and England, thereby establishing the family fortune (about &pound;100,000).<br>
<br>In 1774 Donaldson took over the editorship of the bi-weekly <span class="italic">Edinburgh Advertiser</span>, which his father had founded about ten years earlier. The paper grew into a flourishing business, particularly during the years of the American War of Independence and the French Revolution. In 1792 he married Jean Gillespie. They lived first in George Street and then in both a town residence at 85 Princes Street and a country seat at Broughton Hall. They had five children, none of whom survived childhood.<br>
<br>Donaldson more than doubled his inheritance through judicious investments, and although rumours of eccentricity and even miserliness seem to have circulated about him, he was extremely regular in his work habits, a fair employer, and generous in response to appeals for charity. He became a burgess and guild brother of the city of Edinburgh, and a director of the Bank of Scotland; he sat on the jury which convicted the infamous burglar Deacon Brodie in 1788. He retired in 1820.<br>
<br>On the death of his wife in 1828 Donaldson made a will leaving his fortune (&pound;215,377) for the founding of a hospital for destitute children, with preference to be given to those named Donaldson and Marshall. He died at Broughton Hall on 16 December 1830, and was buried in the graveyard of St John's Church, Princes Street. Donaldson's Hospital was built at West Coates, Edinburgh, to a design by William Henry Playfair, and inaugurated in 1851; as Donaldson's College it is now a leading institution in the education of deaf people.<br>
