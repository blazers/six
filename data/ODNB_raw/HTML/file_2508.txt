<span class="headword">Blackall,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1737, <em>d.</em> 1792), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at Exminster, Devon, on 24 February 1737, the son of Theophilus Blackall (<i>d</i>. 1757), chancellor of the diocese of Exeter, and his wife, Phillippa Cooke; his paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2507/', "Ofspring Blackall")</script>, bishop of Exeter. Having been educated at Tiverton under Mr Dadds he was admitted as pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 29 October 1755. He graduated BA (as twelfth wrangler) in 1760, proceeded MA in 1763 and BD in 1770, and was made fellow of his college in 1772. He was ordained deacon in London on 1 June 1760.<br>
<br>Blackall was described as a lively, clever, musical man who was a good rower, played the harpsichord well and sang, and was good at drawing and etching. In appearance he was dark and short, with a rather ugly face, and he suffered with a lame leg. He was one of those who in 1771&#150;2 were involved with the Feathers tavern petition, which sought to end the requirements regarding subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. In 1772 he published <span class="italic">A letter to Dr Hallifax, upon the subject of his three discourses preached before the University of Cambridge, occasioned by an attempt to abolish subscription to the XXXIX Articles</span>. Samuel Hallifax, then a fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, responded dismissively to Blackall in the preface to the 1772 (third) edition of his controversial <span class="italic">Three Sermons</span>, whose contents were mentioned in the title of Blackall's tract, merely observing that he held it a duty to himself &#145;not to render an enemy considerable by opposition, whose malice may most effectually be disarmed by contempt&#146;  (Hallifax, xi). The disagreement between the two men was continued in the letter pages of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, where both parties, but especially Blackall, found articulate defenders. &#145;M.X.&#146; accused Blackall of Socinianism in one letter, prompting &#145;L.S.&#146;, &#145;C.D.&#146;, and &#145;L.L.B.&#146; to write in Blackall's defence; L.S. asserted that such a charge could only be the invention of slander, and went on to explain that &#145;I never knew any divine more earnest in the defence of Christianity against the objections of infidels, or a warmer advocate for the fundamental articles of our faith, as well as for the essentials of church discipline&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 43.69). Certainly Blackall, unlike Theophilus Lindsey, remained in the Church of England after the failure of the Feathers tavern petition.<br>
<br>In 1786 Blackall was appointed rector of Loughborough, Leicestershire, an Emmanuel College living, which he held until his death, on 6 May 1792, at Bristol Hotwells. He never married, and left most of his possessions to his sister Anne, whose husband, Archdeacon Barnes, was Blackall's executor. Ann inherited &pound;1200 in old South Sea Company stocks, together with the leases of Blackall's house and land in Sidmouth, Devon, and his stables there; she was instructed to bequeath this inheritance, in turn, to her children. Blackall left his nephews Samuel and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2506/', "John Blackall")</script> (the sons of his late brother Theophilus) all his books, manuscripts, and drawing and mathematical instruments, and 20 guineas apiece. Blackall was buried at the parish church of Sidmouth, where a memorial was put up in his name. He specially wished to be buried at Sidmouth because it was &#145;a place in which he had taken great delight when living&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 8.55).<br>
