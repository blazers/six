<span class="headword">Hogarth,  George</span>  (1783&#150;1870), <span class="occ">music critic</span>, was born at Carfrae Mill, near Oxton, Berwickshire, on 6 September 1783, the son of Robert Hogarth, a farmer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott. He studied law in Edinburgh, becoming a writer to the signet, and practising between 1810 and 1830. He also studied the cello and composition, and acted as joint secretary to the Edinburgh music festival in 1815. His literary friends included Walter Scott and John Lockhart, and he was himself one of the most brilliant writers on the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Courant</span>. In 1817, with Scott and his own brother-in-law James Ballantyne, he bought the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Weekly Journal</span>.<br>
<br>On 30 May 1814 Hogarth married Georgina (1793&#150;1863), daughter of the Edinburgh music publisher and editor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27302/', "George Thomson (1757&#150;1851)")</script>; they had ten children. Giving up the law and moving to London in 1830 (at least partly for financial reasons), he wrote for <span class="italic">The Harmonicon</span>, but was disappointed of the editorship of <span class="italic">The Courier</span>. In 1831 he went to Exeter to edit the tory <span class="italic">Western Luminary</span>, and in the following year he moved to Halifax as the first editor of the <span class="italic">Halifax Guardian</span>; the pressures of his growing family led him to offer his services as a teacher in this town. In 1834 he returned to London and was engaged by the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> as a writer on political and musical subjects. A large share of the management of this paper devolved onto him, and it was here that he first encountered <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7599/', "Charles Dickens")</script>, who was writing for the paper under the pseudonym &#145;Boz&#146;. In 1835 Hogarth, as co-editor, commissioned Dickens to write a series of &#145;Sketches&#146; for the <span class="italic">Evening Chronicle</span>, an offshoot of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. In 1836 Dickens married Hogarth's daughter Catherine, and Hogarth actively promoted his son-in-law's career. The cordial relationship between the two men deteriorated with Dickens's marriage, and by 1854 the author was remarking, &#145;I think my constitution is already undermined by the sight of Hogarth at breakfast&#146; (cited in Carlton, 87). The eventual breakup of the marriage caused a further rift with the Hogarths, not least because Catherine's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54671/', "Georgina Hogarth")</script> chose to remain with Dickens.<br>
<br>Hogarth was editor of the <span class="italic">Musical Herald</span> in 1846&#150;7, and on the foundation of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1846 (with Dickens as editor) he was appointed music critic, a post he held until 1866 when ill health caused his resignation. Between 1850 and 1864 he acted as secretary of the Philharmonic Society. He was also for many years music critic at the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and contributed to many periodicals and edited various musical and literary works. A man of liberal sympathies and considerable learning, Hogarth was a just, outspoken, and generous critic. His most important publications are <span class="italic">Musical History, Biography and Criticism</span> (1835) and <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Musical Drama</span> (1838, rev. 1851 as <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Opera</span>). <span class="italic">The Philharmonic Society of London, 1813&#150;1862</span> (1862) was valuable for introducing music to a wide public, and Hogarth's writings remain interesting for their frank and lively account of Victorian music-making. He also composed songs and piano pieces. In January 1870 he fell down the stairs at the office of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, breaking an arm and a leg; he never recovered from the effect of these injuries, and died at the house of his daughter Helen Roney, 10 Gloucester Crescent, Regent's Park, on 12 February 1870.<br>
