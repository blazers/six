<span class="headword">Garrard, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1571), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in the parish of St Magnus the Martyr near London Bridge, the son of John Garrard, a London grocer. He became a haberdasher and merchant adventurer, growing rich on the cloth-export trade to Antwerp. He bought the manor of Dorney, Buckinghamshire, in 1542, but continued to live mainly in London and remained an active merchant all his life. When the Antwerp market began to contract, he diversified into more risky ventures. In 1552 he exported linen and woollen cloth, coral, amber, and jet to the Barbary coast in return for sugar, dates, almonds, and molasses. He was involved in a number of voyages to Guinea in the 1550s and 1560s, shared in two of the slaving expeditions of Sir John Hawkins, and was a leading promoter of the expedition of Richard Chancellor to Russia in 1553. Garrard was named a consul of the Russia Company when it was founded about 1553, and from 1561 until his death was almost continuously either sole or joint governor of the company. He was also a governor of the Mineral and Battery Works founded in 1568.<br>
<br>An alderman by 1547, Garrard was elected sheriff of the City of London in 1552, mayor in 1555&#151;being knighted during his term of office&#151;and one of London's MPs in the last parliament of Mary I's reign. But his major contribution to the corporate life of the City was his work for the relief of the poor. In 1545 he was one of those appointed to devise new means of tackling the problem and in the 1550s he took a leading part in drawing up constitutions for the City's new or refounded hospitals. He was a governor of Christ's Hospital in 1553&#150;4, of Bridewell in 1558&#150;9, and of St Bartholomew's from 1559 until his death, surveyor of all the City's hospitals in 1566&#150;7 and their comptroller-general from 1568. He maintained his interest until the end, bequeathing to Christ's Hospital &pound;20, &#145;which they owe me that I lent them&#146;, with an additional &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., besides &pound;20 each to St Bartholomew's and St Thomas's. He also left money for prisoners in the City's prisons and the Gate House at Westminster and for poor householders in his ward and in two London parishes&#151;St Magnus and St Christopher-le-Stocks, where he was then living&#151;and in the parishes of Dorney and Burnham in Buckinghamshire and Sittingbourne in Kent, where he owned property.<br>
<br>Garrard died on 27 September 1571 and was buried, as he had requested, in the church of St Magnus the Martyr. He was survived by his wife, Isabel, daughter of Julian Nethermill, a Coventry draper, and their four sons and one daughter. The eldest son inherited Dorney and became a country gentleman, but John, the third son, followed his father as a City merchant and, in 1601, lord mayor. Sir Samuel Garrard, lord mayor in 1709, was a descendant of this son, providing a rare example of continuity in the mercantile &eacute;lite of London.<br>
