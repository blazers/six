<span class="headword">Pearse,  Thomas Deane</span>  (1741/2&#150;1789), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was the son of Captain Thomas Pearse RN and his wife, Martha Purvis. After training at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Pearse was appointed a fireworker in the Royal Artillery and saw service at St Malo and Cherbourg (1758), Martinique and Guadeloupe (1759), Belle &Icirc;le (1761), and Havana (1762). He was appointed second lieutenant on 24 October 1761, and first lieutenant on 3 February 1766. In February 1768 he transferred to the East India Company service, becoming major in the Bengal artillery on 2 September 1768, lieutenant-colonel on 30 October 1769, and colonel on 22 January 1781. In 1775 he took command of the Bengal artillery, to which he introduced many reforms, confiding to a friend that he was &#145;astonished at the ignorance of all who composed [the corps]&#146;  (Buckle, 31). It had become clear from early campaign experience in India that British armies needed substantial field artillery in order to balance the invariably greater numbers of opposing Indian armies with greater firepower. In Pearse's time the Bengal artillery was expanded from five companies in 1770 to an independent brigade of a European regiment and three Indian battalions of over 3000 men by 1778.<br>
<br>Pearse was high in the favour of Warren Hastings, the governor-general, and acted as Hastings's second in his duel with Philip Francis on 17 August 1780. In 1781, at the height of the Second Anglo-Mysore War, between Madras and Haidar Ali of Mysore in the Carnatic, Hastings decided to send a detachment of five regiments of sepoys and a detail of field artillery from Bengal to relieve the Madras presidency at Fort St George, and gave the command to Pearse. This provoked strong protests from infantry colleagues who believed that, as in the royal army, commands should not be given to artillerymen. The detachment proceeded south from Bengal near the coast on its march through Orissa and the Northern Circars and, having reached the vicinity of Madras in July 1781, it joined the Madras field army under the commander-in-chief, Sir Eyre Coote. During the ensuing arduous warfare in which they were engaged until the end of the war in June 1783, the Bengal corps, under Pearse, attained a lasting reputation for its actions in the battles of Polillur (27 August 1781) and Sholinghur (27 September 1781) against Haidar Ali, and in the attack on the French lines at Cuddalore near Fort St David (13 June 1783), the last being one of the first occasions on which European and Indian troops fought one another at bayonet point.<br>
<br>Some 2000 veterans of the original 5000 Bengal troops returned to Bengal with Pearse early in 1785, where they were congratulated for their services by Warren Hastings in person; Pearse was later awarded a sword of honour. He was made second in command of the Bengal army in July 1787. During his command of the Bengal artillery, Pearse had transformed an ill-equipped, poorly managed corps into a thoroughly professional force capable of filling the major role required of it. His wider interests were revealed by his foundation of a school to teach his men to read. In 1785 he contributed a paper entitled &#145;Two Hindu festivals and the Indian sphinx&#146; to the Asiatic Society of Bengal; it was subsequently published in Dublin in <span class="italic">Dissertations and miscellaneous pieces relating to the history and antiquities &hellip; of Asia, by Sir W. Jones &hellip; and others</span> (1793). Pearse was married to an Indian, Panna Purree (<i>d</i>. 1820). He died on the River Ganges near Serampore, Bengal, on 15 June 1789.<br>
