<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boston,  Thomas</span>  (1676&#150;1732), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born on 17 March 1676 at Duns, Berwickshire, the youngest of seven children of John Boston (1631&#150;1701), a cooper, and his wife, Alison Trotter (<i>d</i>. 1691). Although he laboured in obscure parishes Thomas Boston of Ettrick became a national figure through his involvement in the Marrow controversy and through the evangelical Calvinism of his popular writings. He was a staunch Presbyterian from the time of his conversion. As a small boy he spent time in the local prison with his father, who was incarcerated for failing to conform to the Church of Scotland, then under episcopal governance. During adolescence he accompanied his father to worship services held by Scottish covenanters in nearby fields, later dating his Christian conversion to the open air preaching of Henry Erskine in the summer of 1687. Boston attended the grammar school in Duns between 1685 and 1689. After a brief stint as a notary's assistant there he was sent to Edinburgh University in December 1691 from where he graduated MA in 1694 and to where he returned in the following year to study divinity for four months. His early career was unsettled. He served, in turn, as a schoolmaster in Glencairn, a private tutor in the household of Lieutenant-Colonel James Bruce of Kennet, and as an itinerant preacher in vacant parishes in the presbytery of Stirling. After a series of failed attempts to secure a regular pulpit in the Scottish border country he was finally ordained on 21 September 1699 at Simprin, Berwickshire.<br>
<br>Within the year (on 17 July 1700) Boston married Katharine Brown (1674&#150;1737), whom he had met previously at Barhill, Culross. He was deeply devoted to his wife, especially during the unspecified &#145;heavy trouble&#146; which began in 1720 and frequently confined her to bed. Although the couple had ten children in all, six died in early childhood, and Boston's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1776) contains touching accounts of his grief over their loss. One of the sons who survived was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2944/', "Thomas Boston (1713&#150;1767)")</script>, who succeeded his father as minister at Ettrick (1733) and became a founder of the Relief church in 1761. Thomas Boston the elder was translated to Ettrick, Selkirkshire, on 1 May 1707, the first day of the Union between England and Scotland. In 1717 he was called to the parish of Closeburn, but managed to persuade the presbytery to allow him to remain in Ettrick, where his ministry was finally beginning to make an impression on village life. He was diligent in his pastoral duties, believing that &#145;ministers by carelessness become the murderers of the souls of their people&#146;  (Aberdeen, Boston MS 3245/2.157). Though sometimes discouraged and often in poor health, he never failed to appear for a worship service in more than thirty years of public ministry. In addition to preaching twice on the sabbath and once during the week he visited every household in the parish twice annually for personal conference and catechetical instruction.<br>
<br>It was not Boston's activity as a rural pastor, however, but as a theologian which made him a familiar figure in the Scottish church. He played a significant role in each of the major ecclesiastical controversies of the early eighteenth century. This was the result of conviction rather than design; by his own admission his natural temperament was &#145;timorous and hard to enter on, but eager in the pursuit once entered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 12.10). Among the laity Boston became popular for opposing the abjuration oaths of 1712 and 1719 which he refused to take, at risk to health and property, because they affirmed the legitimacy of the Church of England in its episcopal form. He was equally unbending in his opposition to the heresies of John Simson, professor of divinity in the University of Glasgow. Simson was first censured in 1717 by the Church of Scotland's general assembly for attributing &#145;too much to natural reason and the power of corrupt nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts of the General Assembly, 1638&#150;1842</span>, 518). A decade later he was found guilty of Arianism and was eventually suspended from his academic duties. Boston stood alone in the 1729 assembly to issue his dissent. He argued that the sentence was too lenient to express &#145;the dishonour done by the said Mr. Simson to our glorious Redeemer, the great God and our Saviour&#146; by casting doubt on the deity of Jesus Christ  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 12.384).<br>
<br>Boston was also at the centre of the most famous ecclesiastical dispute of his day, the Marrow controversy (1717&#150;23). This dispute was prompted by a doctrinal proposition which the Auchterarder presbytery required ministerial candidates to sign: &#145;It is not sound and orthodox to teach, that we must forsake sin in order to our coming to Christ, and instating us in covenant with God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 12.291). Although the Auchterarder creed was intended to preserve Calvinist orthodoxy by establishing the priority of faith over repentance, it was abolished by the 1717 general assembly. Boston &#145;believed the proposition to be truth, howbeit not well worded&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 12.291). His own convictions about faith and repentance had been shaped by his reading of Edward Fisher's <span class="italic">The Marrow of Modern Divinity</span> (1645), a work he discovered in the cottage of a parishioner about 1700. The <span class="italic">Marrow</span> contained a series of dialogues largely quoted from protestant reformers and English puritans. The book was sympathetic to the theology of the Auchterarder creed and showed how orthodox Calvinism could offer assurance of faith without falling into legalism. Boston thus recommended it to James Hog of Carnock, who had it republished in 1718. The <span class="italic">Marrow</span> aroused opposition from a majority in the church, led by Principal James Hadow of St Mary's College, St Andrews, who considered it antinomian in tendency. The 1720 general assembly condemned the <span class="italic">Marrow</span> and required ministers to warn their parishioners against it. Boston joined others in drafting a &#145;representation and petition&#146; protesting the assembly's action. After due process the 1722 general assembly overwhelmingly reaffirmed their prior action and the moderator issued a formal rebuke to the Marrow men. This was the end of the controversy proper, although in 1726 Boston published a carefully annotated edition of the <span class="italic">Marrow</span> using the pseudonym Philalethes Irenaeus. He later came to believe that the ecclesiastical notoriety he received as a Marrow man prevented him from advancing to a more prominent pulpit. Nevertheless, the controversy helped secure his popularity in the Scottish border country, where the assembly's condemnation had the unintended result of stimulating greater interest in the Marrow theology.<br>
<br>Although Boston's theology sometimes has been viewed as an attempt to moderate the severity of orthodox Calvinism, it is better understood as a recovery of vital Reformation doctrines, including the &#145;free offer of the gospel&#146; which became a hallmark of his evangelical preaching. Like the protestant reformers, he taught that assurance of salvation rests on what Christ did rather than on what the Christian does. But this was not to minimize the importance of holy living, which is prompted by the gift of God's grace, not by the fear of God's law. Good works provide, in turn, still further assurance through what Boston termed &#145;the reflex act&#146; of faith. Boston's popular reputation was further enhanced by his books, the most famous of which was <span class="italic">Human Nature in its Fourfold State</span> (1720, 1729). The <span class="italic">Fourfold State</span>, as it was called, became the most frequently reprinted Scottish book of the eighteenth century, going through well over a hundred editions in all. The book consists of a collection of sermons preached early in Boston's ministry and revised throughout his lifetime. It takes its structure from the four conditions of humanity first posited by Augustine: creation, fall, grace, and glory. Boston termed these the states of innocence, nature, grace, and eternity. This simple, practical, and memorable summary of Christian doctrine became a commonplace among Scottish Calvinists. The <span class="italic">Fourfold State's</span> emphases on the totality of sin, the necessity of being born again, the desirability of being united to Christ, and the reality of the life to come also made it a central text for the rise of evangelicalism in Britain and America. It was a best-seller during the Great Awakening, in part because it came highly recommended by both John Wesley and George Whitefield. The American theologian Jonathan Edwards considered its author &#145;a truly great divine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Jonathan Edwards</span>, 2.489). Nearly all the rest of Boston's writings were published posthumously and are included in his <span class="italic">Complete Works</span> (1854). They are distinguished by their simplicity, for Boston had mastered the plain homiletical style so admired by the puritans. His contemporaries lauded his &#145;peculiar talent for going deep into the mysteries of the gospel, and at the same time for making them plain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 12.451). Most notable among the other writings are <span class="italic">A View of the Covenant of Grace</span> (1734) and <span class="italic">A View of the Covenant of Works</span> (1772). Boston's unique contribution to the history of covenant theology was to show that the covenant of redemption (between God the Father and God the Son) and the covenant of grace (between God and his people) are one and the same: God the Father makes a gracious covenant with God the Son, who keeps the covenant as a representative for his people. Although he frequently lamented the inadequacy of his library, Boston was well versed in the literature of international Calvinism. He conducted painstaking independent research into the accent marks of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>, eventually writing a learned treatise interpreting their significance and defending their divine inspiration (<span class="italic">Tractatus stigmologicus</span>, Amsterdam, 1738). In addition to numerous individual sermons, many preached on sacramental occasions, Boston wrote a lengthy exposition of the Westminster shorter catechism (<span class="italic">An Illustration of the Doctrines of the Christian Religion</span>, 3 vols., 1755), as well as shorter treatises on divine providence (<span class="italic">The Crook in the Lot</span>, 1737) and evangelistic preaching (<span class="italic">A Soliloquy on the Art of Man-Fishing</span>, 1773). He also produced a spiritual autobiography, primarily for the benefit of his children. These <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> have become a classic of Calvinist spiritual devotion. They reveal a man earnest in ministry, melancholy in disposition, scholarly in interest, modest in aspiration, sober in judgement, sensitive in conscience, and devout in prayer. It is not surprising that his colleagues greatly admired his &#145;deep and high sense of divine things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 12.451). Thomas Boston's commitment to his sacred office is perhaps best illustrated by the way he persevered in his pastoral duties during the illness which claimed his life on 20 May 1732. He delivered his final sermons from his deathbed, as the people of Ettrick gathered around the window of the manse to hear their beloved minister preach. He was buried in Ettrick churchyard.<br>
