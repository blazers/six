<span class="headword">Huxtable,  Anthony</span>  (1808&#150;1883), <span class="occ">agriculturist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 30 November 1808 in Williton, Somerset, the eldest of the three sons of Anthony Huxtable, a Bristol surgeon. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA in 1833. He was ordained deacon in 1833 and after being made priest in 1834 became vicar of Sutton Waldron, north-east Dorset, a small parish and one of the most backward agriculturally in that county. He was an energetic builder and engineer, and made use of innovative designs and newly available materials, such as indiarubber. He demolished the existing Saxon church and erected St Bartholomew's (1847), which was noted for the interior decorations by Owen Jones. A tractarian, whose work for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel attracted national attention, he became archdeacon of Dorset in 1862 but resigned, through ill health, nine months later.<br>
<br>Aided by the wealth of his first wife, Maria Langstone (<i>d</i>. 1874), whom he married in 1840, and by the patronage of the first Viscount Portman, a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society, Huxtable rented two farms in the parish to pursue experimental scientific farming with the object of relieving the misery of farmer and labourer alike in the face of the impending repeal of the corn laws. In 1845 he published in volume six of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England</span> the results of a successful experiment in cultivating swedes to determine what would happen when the essential constituents of a plant were supplied to &#145;barren&#146; land. This attracted national attention, causing Huxtable to be appointed to the chemical committee of the society, of which he was a member until 1867. His farming methods were unique in that all stock were housed and fed in sheds; there were no fences or trees. Employing a steam-engine, liquid animal and artificial manures were pumped through ceramic pipelines to delivery points in the fields and, in collaboration with the sanitation pioneer Edwin Chadwick, Huxtable also carried out experiments to test the possibilities of disposing of urban sewage by pumping it on to farm land. In 1845 Huxtable passed liquid farm manure through a bed of Dorset loam, the emerging liquid being clear and free of any offensive smell. This made a fundamental contribution to knowledge of the phenomenon of absorption and led to changes in the composition of artificial manures. It also inspired the Revd Henry Moule of Dorchester to design his patent earth closet, which enjoyed great commercial success.<br>
<br>Huxtable was an effective propagandist, by the spoken or written word, for his innovative ideas for recycling waste materials and conserving resources; his principal publication, <span class="italic">The &#145;Present Prices&#146;</span> (1850), went through seven editions. Although his farms attracted many distinguished visitors, including Sir Robert Peel, he attracted great controversy, both for his support of the Dorset farm labourers and for his novel practices. This probably exacerbated his tendency to long periods of nervous exhaustion, which caused his absence from his parish while he recovered.<br>
<br>Huxtable's second marriage, in 1875, was to a Yorkshire widow, Susannah Maria Gott, who outlived him. There were no children of either marriage. He died at St Leonards, Sussex, on 12 December 1883 and was buried in Sutton Waldron.<br>
