<span class="headword">Darwin,  Leonard</span>  (1850&#150;1943), <span class="occ">scientist and eugenicist</span>, was born on 15 January 1850 at Down House, Downe, Kent, the fourth son and eighth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7176/', "Charles Robert Darwin (1809&#150;1882)")</script> and his wife, Emma Darwin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wedgwood (1808&#150;1896). He was educated privately and at Clapham grammar school, but his happy and privileged home environment in the countryside of the North Downs was the strongest influence on his early development. At the age of eighteen he passed into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, claiming in characteristically self-effacing fashion that he chose the army as his profession because he thought himself the stupidest member of the family. He was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1871 and worked at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham until, in 1874, he was chosen by Captain Abney, instructor of chemistry and photography, as the photographer on an expedition to New Zealand to observe the transit of Venus on 9 December. The day, however, was cloudy. After a two-year posting in Malta he returned to Chatham to succeed Captain Abney.<br>
<br>In 1882 (the year of his father's death) Darwin married Elizabeth Frances Fraser (11 July), and with her and two Royal Engineers officers he set off once again to observe a transit of Venus, this time from Australia on 10 December. The day was cloudy once more. He returned at the end of April 1883, spent two years at the Staff College at Camberley as instructor in chemistry, and then moved to London on his appointment to the War Office intelligence department, where he was concerned with African questions.<br>
<br>In 1886 the weather at last smiled on an astronomical expedition undertaken by Darwin, this time to Grenada in the West Indies to photograph a total eclipse of the sun. Soon after his return he joined the Royal Geographical Society; he was elected to its council in 1890 and served as president from 1908 to 1911. He resigned his commission in 1890, having attained the rank of major. He then entered the second phase of his long life, serving first on the London county council and then, in 1892, as the member of parliament for Lichfield. He was elected by a majority of only four, and lost the seat in the 1895 election. His experiences in parliament led to an interest in economics and thence to his book <span class="italic">Bimetallism</span> (1897), of which Maynard Keynes wrote after Darwin's death:<blockquote>His book appeared towards the end of the long controversy [on the use of both gold and silver as the basis for currencies]. But his statement of the conflicting arguments was so clear and unbiassed that it remained the standard text-book &hellip; until questions on bimetallism had disappeared from the examination papers on economic theory. (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, Dec 1943)</blockquote>A similarly balanced approach marked Darwin's next work, <span class="italic">Municipal trade: the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the substitution of representative bodies for private proprietors in the management of industrial undertakings</span> (1903).<br>
<br>In 1898 Darwin's first wife died, and on 29 November 1900 he married Charlotte Mildred Massingberd, the eldest daughter of his first cousin Edmund Langton (she had changed her name from Langton). There were no children of either marriage. The third and most important phase of his life did not start until he was sixty-one, when he was persuaded to succeed his father's cousin Sir Francis Galton as president of the Eugenics Education Society upon the latter's death in 1911. He held the presidency until 1928 (by which time the word &#145;Education&#146; had been dropped). In 1926 his book <span class="italic">The Need for Eugenic Reform</span> had appeared, shortly followed by the more popular <span class="italic">What is Eugenics?</span> His greatest influence was through his support and encouragement of the young R. A. Fisher. The friendship between the two men, forty years apart in age, formed the intellectual link between Charles Darwin and Francis Galton on the one hand and Fisher on the other, and thus to neo-Darwinism and the foundations of modern statistics. Leonard suggested the topic of Fisher's classic 1918 paper &#145;The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance&#146;, and saw to its publication, personally defraying some of the cost. In 1930 Fisher dedicated <span class="italic">The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</span> to him, and when Darwin died in 1943 Fisher described him as the kindest and wisest man he ever knew. In 1912 the University of Cambridge conferred the honorary degree of doctor of science on Darwin.<br>
<br>Darwin and his wife moved from London to West Hoathly, near Forest Row, Sussex, in 1921. Mildred Darwin died in 1940. Darwin died from bronchial pneumonia at home on 26 March 1943. He was buried at Forest Row cemetery.<br>
