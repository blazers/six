<span class="headword">Pyel,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1315&#150;1382), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was probably born in Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, in the second decade of the fourteenth century. He was descended from a family of bondsmen of Peterborough Abbey, and his father, also John, was a minor landholder in the area. His younger brother, Henry, was educated at Oxford and went on to a career in the church, becoming archdeacon of Northampton. John the younger, however, was sent to London to be apprenticed to trade. He was evidently successful, and his first appearance in the records, in 1345, shows him lending the sum of &pound;40. The following year he was a commissioner appointed to sell off or lease the property of non-resident alien clergy in the diocese of London, for whose profits he was to account to the king.<br>
<br>Pyel was a supporter of the syndicate of customs farmers headed by Walter Chiriton, which ultimately collapsed in 1349, and Pyel's involvement in questionable practices before the collapse led to his trial and imprisonment for debt. He was bailed by his friends and associates, John Wesenham and Adam Fraunceys, in the spring of 1350, and shortly afterwards appears to have undertaken some diplomatic service for the king in Spain. Besides dealing in wool Pyel seems to have been specifically concerned with trade in the east midlands. He was connected with John Garlekmongere, member of a prominent mercantile family of Northampton, and in 1370 was appointed to a commission which had been established to inquire into the construction of new mills and ponds which were blocking the passage of merchandise along the River Ouse between Huntingdon and St Ives. In the same year he was granted a licence to buy and ship cereals from the east midlands and Sussex to London.<br>
<br>Pyel was also a financier, but apparently not on the same scale as some of his contemporaries. He lent to religious houses, fellow Londoners, and the rural gentry, but only much later in his career to the crown. Many of his loans to the gentry, especially those living in Northamptonshire, were made with the intention of, or at least in the hope of, acquiring land. Some landholders, like Sir Thomas Wake of Blisworth, became indebted at the time of the Calais expedition of 1346&#150;7, when large sums had to be spent on equipment for the campaign. Sir Thomas died while on service, and his manor of Cransley was evidently insufficient to redeem his debts, for it passed to Pyel on the eve of the black death in July 1348. Cransley was the first substantial estate in Northamptonshire which Pyel obtained, and its acquisition may well have been fortuitous. His other lands, principally the two fees of Irthlingborough and the manors of Sudborough, Cranford, and Woodford, were acquired during the following two decades from landlords who found themselves impoverished in the aftermath of the black death, or at least unable to keep up estates in which they themselves were not resident. By 1370 Pyel had carved out for himself a coherent landed estate in Northamptonshire centred on Irthlingborough, his birthplace.<br>
<br>It was about this date that Pyel turned his attention back to London. Despite his relative affluence and status he had held no major office in the city. He had been a common councilman and MP in 1361, but it was not until 1369 that he was elected alderman of Castle Baynard and sheriff, and he became mayor in 1372. He bought a house in Broad Street from Adam Fraunceys in 1374. His connection with the court party also dates from this period. He was involved in diplomatic activities in Flanders between 1371 and 1375, and was associated with John of Gaunt. In 1372 and 1374 he made two large loans to the crown, the second of them with Richard Lyons, a London merchant with close court connections. This loan of 20,000 marks was repaid as &pound;20,000, a profit to the creditors of 10,000 marks, or 50 per cent interest. During the Good Parliament it was cited as an example of the corruption of Lyons, who with other members of the court faction was being impeached by the Commons. Pyel, who by foresight or good fortune was sitting in this parliament, successfully managed to distance himself from Lyons and so escaped censure. Nevertheless he was forced to resign his aldermanry in 1376 under the new regulations governing the election of aldermen in London, and although re-elected in 1378, he apparently left the city shortly afterwards and retired to Irthlingborough. In his will, dated 1379, he gave orders for a college to be established at St Peter's Church in Irthlingborough (where he was later buried), an act of piety which his widow successfully completed. He died in 1382 and was survived by his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1412), and his second son, Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1406).<br>
