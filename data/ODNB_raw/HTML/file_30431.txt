<span class="headword">Arbuthnot,  Forster Fitzgerald</span>  (1833&#150;1901), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born at Belgaum, Bombay, India, on 21 May 1833, the second son of Sir Robert Keith Arbuthnot, second baronet, and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9572/', "Field Marshal Sir John Forster Fitzgerald (1784/5&#150;1877)")</script>. He was educated privately on the continent, at Anhalt and Geneva. He received a nomination to East India College, Haileybury, in 1851.<br>
<br>Arbuthnot went out to India and joined the Bombay civil service in 1853. In 1879 he married Ellinor, daughter of Admiral Sir James Stirling and widow of James Alexander Guthrie of Craigie, Forfarshire. There were no children of the marriage. Arbuthnot retired in 1878. His last appointment was that of tax collector for Bombay city and island. He was remembered by his contemporaries for his carriage driving and for his seaside residence at Bandra, outside the island, where he entertained the explorer and scholar Sir Richard Francis Burton and his wife in 1876.<br>
<br>Arbuthnot had already been initiated into oriental literature by Edward Rehatsek, an eccentric but learned Hungarian who led the life of a faqir at Bombay. Shortly after his return to England he associated himself with Burton in founding the Kama Shastra Society, for the issue to private subscribers of unexpurgated translations of oriental classics. He was active in commissioning the translation of Jami's <span class="italic">Beharistan</span> and of Sa&#145;di's <span class="italic">Gulistan</span>. Burton dedicated the fourth volume of his <span class="italic">Arabian Nights</span> to him, commending his critical appreciation of oriental literature. Arbuthnot's own books were popular compilations, the two most important being <span class="italic">Persian Portraits</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Arabic Authors</span> (1890). A work of more permanent value was his inauguration of a new series of publications by the Oriental Translation Fund in 1891, which he launched with some translations by Rehatsek, and which was continued after his death through his bequests.<br>
<br>Arbuthnot was a member of council and also a trustee of the Royal Asiatic Society, and he took a prominent part in organizing the reception of the international congress of orientalists that met in London in 1892. He was well known for his hospitality, both at his town house in Park Lane and at his country residence near Guildford. He took a lively interest in his village neighbours. His memory was preserved by the Arbuthnot Institute, Shemley Green. He died in London at the Grosvenor Hotel, Buckingham Palace Road, on 25 May 1901. He was survived by his wife.<br>
