<span class="headword">Paton,  John Gibson</span>  (1824&#150;1907), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 24 May 1824 at Kirkmahoe, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He was the eldest of the five sons and six daughters of James Paton, a stocking weaver, and his wife, Janet Jardine Rogerson. The family were members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which upheld the ideals of the covenanters; James Paton was the dominant religious influence on his children. At Torthorwald, near Dumfries, where the family had settled about 1830, John Paton attended the parish school until the age of eleven; he then began work with his father, weaving stockings. In 1847 he went to Glasgow where he trained as a teacher at the Free Church Normal Seminary; he then taught briefly at several Free Church schools. He also attended classes at the University of Glasgow. In 1850 the Glasgow City Mission appointed Paton as a city missionary. For almost seven years he worked in Calton, one of the poorest parts of the city, where he met &#145;considerable opposition from Romanists and Infidels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 43). He also undertook part-time study at the Reformed Presbyterian Divinity Hall at Paisley and, in preparation for work as a foreign missionary, attended lectures in the practice of medicine and midwifery at Anderson's University, Glasgow.<br>
<br>The Reformed Presbyterian church was already supporting a missionary, John Inglis, at Aneityum in the New Hebrides, in the south-west Pacific. The church's foreign missions committee was keen to extend its work in the region and in 1856 Paton offered his services. On 1 December 1857 he was licensed as a preacher and on 23 March 1858 he was ordained at Great Hamilton Street Reformed Presbyterian Church in Glasgow, where he was an elder. On 2 April 1858 he married Mary Ann Robson (1840&#150;1859), daughter of Peter Robson of Coldstream. The couple sailed from Greenock on 16 April 1858 and reached the mission station at Aneityum on 30 August. Soon afterwards they moved to the adjacent island of Tanna, to open a new station at Port Resolution. Since 1839, when Samoan teachers of the London Missionary Society (LMS) were first sent to the island, there had been a series of attempts to convert the Tannese to Christianity, but without success. In February 1859 Mary Paton gave birth to a son; in March both she and the child died. In 1861 the introduction of measles, which killed many of the islanders, was followed by a series of hurricanes. Many of the Tannese opposed the mission, believing that the Christian God and his agents were responsible for their disasters. Their lives in danger, in February 1862 Paton and his followers fled to Aneityum. The other Presbyterian missionaries then sent Paton to the Australian colonies to promote their cause and to raise funds for a mission vessel.<br>
<br>Paton proved to be an effective preacher and speaker on behalf of the New Hebrides mission. Travelling around the colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, he addressed meetings almost every day, and three or four gatherings each Sunday. To arouse the interest of Sunday-school children he devised a scheme by which they could become sixpenny shareholders in the new mission ship, <i>Dayspring</i>, built in Nova Scotia in 1863. Among Australian Presbyterians support for the New Hebrides mission became a popular cause, and Paton raised &pound;5000. Later in 1863 he returned to Scotland to continue his appeal and in 1864 he was elected moderator of the Reformed Presbyterian church. On 17 June 1864 he married <a href="#cosubject_49402">Margaret Whitecross [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had five surviving sons and one daughter. Two sons, Frederick and Francis (Frank), became missionaries in the New Hebrides and their daughter, Mary Ann (Minnie), married a missionary there.<br>
<br>Paton arrived back in the New Hebrides in June 1865 with his wife and two recruits for the Presbyterian mission. There he instigated an appeal by the missionaries to Commodore Sir William Wiseman of HMS <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> to punish the Tannese for their killing of British subjects and their destruction of mission property. In August 1865 the <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> shelled villages at Port Resolution and its sailors made an armed landing. This use of naval force to protect the mission was widely reported in the Australian colonial press and Paton was much criticized for his role. When he next arrived at Sydney he found himself, he recalled, &#145;probably the best-abused man in all Australia&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 298). The incident remains a controversial event in the history of Tanna.<br>
<br>In 1866 Paton was appointed by the Presbyterian Church of Victoria as its first missionary to the New Hebrides. After the events of 1865 it was not possible for him to return to his former field on Tanna, and he was therefore sent to the small island of Aniwa, where since 1840 LMS Polynesian teachers and Aneityumese teachers had attempted to introduce Christianity. This was to be Paton's base for the next fifteen years. For the first time his preaching was successful, so that the whole population of Aniwa, numbering about two hundred, eventually adopted Christianity.<br>
<br>In 1881, having been compelled by ill health to retire from missionary work in the islands, Paton and his family went to Melbourne, where he was appointed mission agent of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. He had lost none of his skills as a publicist and fund-raiser. In total he raised about &pound;83,000 for the New Hebrides mission, and the John G. Paton Mission Fund was founded in Britain in 1890 to support its work. Paton became moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria in 1886. In the Australian and New Zealand colonies, and on his visits to the USA, Canada, and Britain, Paton was vocal on many issues concerning the New Hebrides. He opposed the growth there of French interests, he campaigned for British annexation, and he sought to prevent the sale of arms and alcoholic liquor to the islanders. In his addresses and writings he denounced as a slave trade the practice of recruiting island labour for the sugar plantations of Queensland and Fiji. His allegations were often exaggerated and he was unwilling to admit that the great majority of islanders entered labour contracts voluntarily, but politicians and government officials found him hard to ignore.<br>
<br>During a visit by Paton to Scotland in 1884, at the suggestion of his youngest brother, James, the missionary agreed to write his autobiography. James Paton, a Glasgow minister, shaped these notes into a book which, after the publication of the first two parts in 1889, played a large part in making the name of John G. Paton famous. In 1891 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of divinity.<br>

<a name="cosubject_49402"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Paton</span>  (1841&#150;1905), his second wife, was a <span class="occ">founder of the Presbyterian Women's Missionary Union</span>; she died on 16 May 1905, and the organization built a church at Vila in the New Hebrides and a hospital in Korea in her memory. John Paton died in Melbourne on 28 January 1907 and was buried near his wife in Boroondara cemetery, Kew, Melbourne.<br>
