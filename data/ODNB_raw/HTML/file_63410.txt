<span class="headword">Yates,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born in Bolton, Lancashire, the only child of John Yates, schoolmaster. He was educated at the grammar school in Bolton and entered Warrington Academy in 1772. In 1777 he became minister of Kaye Street Chapel, Liverpool; at his ordination on 1 October William Enfield delivered the charge. In 1791 the congregation moved to Paradise Street, where Yates continued to serve until 1823.<br>
<br>In 1777 Yates married Elizabeth Bostock (1749&#150;1819), the youngest daughter of John Brooks Ashton (1711&#150;1759), a Liverpool merchant, and the widow of John Bostock the elder (1740&#150;1774), a physician in the town; her brother was said to have opposed the match because she might be pauperized, but he later relented and sent his sons to John Yates's school. The wealth that came to Yates with his marriage was expended on their house, Dingle Head, in Toxteth Park, in extensive charity, and in judicious investment in property, which increased the fortune. Five sons and three daughters were born; the eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30195/', "Joseph Brooks Yates (1780&#150;1855)")</script>, merchant and antiquary, and the fourth son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30192/', "James Yates (1789&#150;1871)")</script>, Unitarian minister and antiquary.<br>
<br>John Yates published a few sermons and a collection of hymns; in one unpublished sermon, in 1788, he attacked the evils of the slave trade, deeply offending some of his congregation. A fluent pulpit style belied the great pains he took with composition&#151;he reportedly never preached an old sermon&#151;although some thought he strained for novelty: one story has it that during a sermon on the wonders of nature, he cried &#145;Behold the camel!&#146;, awaking a sleeping lady who exclaimed &#145;Where? where?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 3). He elicited great respect and affection in his congregation and the Liverpool community. Like his friend and neighbouring minister William Shepherd (1768&#150;1847), who had for a time served as tutor to the Yates children, he was active in radical politics and, with other Liverpool worthies, belonged to a literary society that it was thought expedient to dissolve following the younger Pitt's proclamation against sedition in 1792.<br>
<br>In his family, although he liked jokes, read aloud to his children, and taught them to play cards, Yates was a strict disciplinarian, a possibly inherited trait since a family story tells of his mother's sending a messenger to order him home from school to close a door he had left open  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 1&#150;2). Reflecting the awe in which his children held him, a daughter once said that she was certain her father never did anything but from a sense of duty, whereupon her sister-in-law asked if it was also &#145;from a sense of duty that he married Mrs. Bostock?&#146;  (Roberts, 330). His crustiness seems to have increased in his later years when he was lame and in pain from a badly mended leg.<br>
<br>Yates died on 10 November 1826 at Dingle Head. He was probably buried in the graveyard of the Park Chapel, Toxteth Park; the funeral sermon was preached on 19 November by William Shepherd.<br>
