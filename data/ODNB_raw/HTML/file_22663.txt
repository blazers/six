<span class="headword">Powell,  William</span>  (1735/6&#150;1769), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in 1735 or 1736 in Hereford, the son of William Powell (1704&#150;1784), who died at Charlotte Street, Rathborne Place, London, on 31 July 1784. It is uncertain whether or not his mother was the Theodosia Brand (<i>d</i>. 1784) referred to in Powell senior's will, dated 16 April 1784, as &#145;now Theodosia Powell my lawful wife&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). The actor was educated at Hereford grammar school and at Christ's Hospital, London. He was then employed in a City counting-house by Sir Robert Ladbrooke, who was president of Christ's Hospital. He worked for Sir Robert for ten years and was &#145;so clever in business that his master would have taken him in partner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 5.379). The young Powell, however, was a keen participant in amateur theatricals and gained both the friends and the experience, through the spouting clubs he attended, to make his sudden and meteoric change of career in 1763 a possibility. In 1759, while still working for Ladbrooke, he had married Elizabeth Branson (or Branston); by 1761 he had two daughters, Elizabeth Mary and Anne, as well as his wife to support from his secure City employment. Two years later he turned his back on the counting-house and ventured on a career as a professional actor.<br>
<br>Charles Holland, a friend from the spouting clubs who had become established at Drury Lane Theatre, introduced Powell to David Garrick, who at that time was looking for a young player to tutor in some of his leading roles. Garrick himself wanted to make a tour of the continent and needed someone to fill in for him while he was gone. He was impressed by Powell and coached him during the summer of 1763 before leaving for Paris. Powell's d&eacute;but as the eponymous hero in Colman's adaptation of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Philaster</span> was a sensation. As William Hopkins, the Drury Lane prompter, observed in his diary: &#145;A greater reception was never shown to anybody.&#146; It is clear that from the outset Powell's appeal was as an emotive and dynamic actor:<blockquote>
<div>For young Philaster <i>feels</i> his Part,<br>
</div>
<div>And follows Nature more than art.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 11 March 1766)</blockquote>He performed Philaster thirteen times during October and November, including a royal command performance on 20 October. During his first season he took on sixteen further roles, notably that of Othello, the role he chose for his first benefit at Drury Lane, on 31 March 1764. In spite of criticisms of wildness, of overstraining, and of feelings and tears choking his articulation, his power to draw and hold audiences was immense. Theatre receipts relating to his appearances were consistently high (first-night receipts for ten of his major roles ranged from &pound;231 19<i>s</i>. to &pound;268 11<i>s</i>.), and during the course of the season Powell's salary was raised from &pound;3 to &pound;8 per week. At his benefit there was, according to William Hopkins, &#145;one of the greatest overflows that ever was known&#146;. Among the roles he performed during this first season, those which were especially praised for their &#145;great feeling&#146;, &#145;tenderness&#146;, &#145;pathos&#146;, and &#145;strong emotions&#146; included Posthumus in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, Lusignan in Aaron Hill's <span class="italic">Zara</span>, the King in <span class="italic">2 Henry IV</span>, Castalio in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, and Shore in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>. However, it was as Jaffier in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> that he seems to have caught the audience's imagination most consistently:<blockquote>his Distraction on hearing his Friend was to die&#151;his Prayer for Belvidera&#151;his Execution at the tolling of the Bell&#151;his last parting from his Wife, I think were the most masterly strokes of Acting I ever beheld; and indeed the Audience seemed full as sensible of it; for profound Silence and Attention filled the House, while the big Drops rolled down from almost every Eye. (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 31 Jan 1764)</blockquote>This was one of the roles that was to stay in Powell's repertory throughout his brief career. He performed it eight times during his first season at Drury Lane and sixteen times during ensuing seasons, often &#145;by Particular Desire&#146;. It was the role he chose, when he became involved in the management of Covent Garden, for his first acting appearance there in 1767. It also featured regularly in his summer seasons at Bristol, and in 1769 was the last role he ever performed on the stage.<br>
<br>Between the close of his first season and the opening of his second season at Drury Lane, Powell acted at the Jacob's Wells Theatre in the Hotwells district of Bristol. It was the beginning of an important five-year relationship with the city. For his benefit there on 13 August 1764 he played King Lear, a role he was to add to his London repertory five months later. Lear's curse near the end of act I and his reconciliation with Cordelia towards the end of the play were highlights of his portrayal, and featured prominently in accounts of the time. It was in the mad scenes, however, that he clearly excelled:<blockquote>
<div>With such Variety! such Strength! such Taste!<br>
</div>
<div>That in quick Whirlwinds more and more increas'd;<br>
</div>
<div>Till Reason like a shatter'd Vessel tost,<br>
</div>
<div>Amid the Mind's mad Hurricanes was lost.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span>, 15 Aug 1767)</blockquote>Many of the roles Powell performed during his second season at Drury Lane (1764&#150;5) seem to have been chosen to exploit, or build upon, his ability to delineate extreme states of mind or feeling: Lothario in Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, Orestes in Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span>, Herod in Elijah Ferton's <span class="italic">Mariamne</span>, Leontes in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, and, on 2 January 1765, King Lear. In contrast, towards the end of January Powell appeared in a new comedy, Elizabeth Griffith's <span class="italic">The Platonic Wife</span>, playing Lord Frankland, which was his first original role. On the opening night the play &#145;was not well received&#146;  (Victor, 3.60), but after some revision it ran for five further performances.<br>
<br>After a second summer at the Jacob's Wells Theatre, Powell returned to Drury Lane for a third season (1765&#150;6), his first alongside, and under the gaze of, David Garrick. His roles in the early months of the season, after Garrick's return, were Castalio, Jaffier, Lusignan, and Lear. He did not add any roles to his repertory until 11 November (Moneses in Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>) and 26 November (Alcanor in James Miller's <span class="italic">Mahomet</span>). On 23 January 1766 Garrick retrieved the part of Lusignan from Powell for a royal command performance, where the presence of Jean Jacques Rousseau in Garrick's box &#145;fronting his Majesty&#146; caused a stir  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 36, 1766). However, Powell was playing the role again at Drury Lane by 19 April. In Colman and Garrick's <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>, which had a continuous run at Drury Lane from 20 February to 13 March, Powell was the original Lovewell. On 20 March he played the title role in <span class="italic">King John</span>, and on 22 March Antony in Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>.<br>
<br>In Bristol, Powell became involved, together with Matthew Clarke and John Arthur, in the management of the newly built Theatre Royal, which opened on 30 May 1766. After a quarrelsome summer Arthur was replaced by Powell's friend Charles Holland. Over the next two years the new management established this theatre as an important and fashionable centre in Bristol. Powell's interest in management extended to London in 1767, when, at the end of his last season at Drury Lane, he bought a quarter share in the patent and property of Covent Garden. This second venture as a theatre manager&#151;in partnership with George Colman, Thomas Harris, and John Rutherford&#151;proved even more acrimonious, fuelled by Harris's desire to advance his mistress's career, and eventually led to litigation by Harris and Rutherford against Colman (whom Powell supported). The case was settled in Colman's favour in 1770, a year after Powell had died. As Kathleen Barker has observed, Powell's &#145;educational and business background needs to be borne in mind and weighed against the rather derisive remarks made by Garrick and some of his biographers about Powell's lack of culture and qualifications for theatre management&#146;  (Barker, 73).<br>
<br>Powell was the leading actor at Covent Garden under the new management. He delivered an inaugural prologue at the opening on 14 September 1767, played Jaffier on 16 September, and then over the next four months appeared in twenty-two different roles, including Honeywood in the premi&egrave;re of Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Good-Natured Man</span>. From 1768 onwards he was often ill, and during the summer at Bristol he was unable to perform at all for two weeks. During his second season at Covent Garden (1768&#150;9) he added eight new roles to his repertory, among them two originals&#151;Cyrus in John Hoole's play of the same name and Courtney in Charlotte Lennox's <span class="italic">The Sister</span>. But in Bristol the following summer he acted only twice at the Theatre Royal, his last appearance being in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>. On 3 July 1769, after a month's illness, he died in lodgings in King Street, Bristol, from pneumonia, at the age of thirty-three or thirty-four. On 6 July his hearse was carried in procession, preceded by a choir, from College Green to his burial-place, Bristol Cathedral, where the dean conducted the funeral service. &#145;The spectators were too numerous to observe silence and decorum&#146; and were impatient &#145;to take a final look at him, to whom they had been indebted for so many hours of elegant entertainment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sarah Farley's Bristol Journal</span>, 8 July 1769).<br>
<br>Powell left no will. His widow, Elizabeth, erected a monument to her husband in 1771, in the north aisle of Bristol Cathedral, on which is inscribed an epitaph composed by &#145;a faithful friend&#146;, George Colman.<br>
