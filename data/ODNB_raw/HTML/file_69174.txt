<span class="headword">Curwen,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1680), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, was born in Baycliff in the parish of Aldingham, near Ulverston in Furness, Lancashire; his parents' names are not known. About 1641 he married &#145;a strict religious professor&#146;  (Backhouse and others, 200); the maiden name and parentage of his wife, <a name="cosubject_69174"></a><span class="headword">Alice Curwen</span>  (<em>c.</em>1619&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, remain unknown. The Curwens were converted to Quakerism about 1652 during George Fox's mission in Furness. In 1654&#150;6 Curwen was numbered with twenty-six other Friends from Furness and elsewhere in Lancashire who were &#145;several times committed for speaking to priests and people in their public assemblies&#146;  (Nightingale, 35); in 1659 he was assessed for unpaid parish tithes at 12<i>s</i>.&#151;though he had goods distrained to the value of &pound;2 10<i>s</i>.&#151;and was rounded up with co-religionists, &#145;Taken from their homes or from the market or their employment by a party of horsemen and sent to Lancaster Castle without any warrant&#146;  (Nightingale, 32). By 1663 Curwen was free but headed a presentment list of thirteen Quakers in Aldingham township. A further imprisonment in 1665 led to his involvement with other Friends within Lancaster Castle prison in a debate against the Baptist&#150;Fifth Monarchist prisoner John Wiggan, and issuing in a published form (with an appendix by Margaret Fell) the Quaker riposte to a work widely distributed in north Wales and the north-west by Wiggan.<br>
<br>From as early as 1660 Alice Curwen, who had by now emerged as a Quaker preacher, had felt a deep concern for Friends in the American colonies and the persecutions they underwent and, with their family grown, between 1676 and 1678 she and her husband undertook a mission to both Quakers and non-Quakers in Rhode Island, New England (in a critical period of Native American raids), and New Jersey. The Curwens were gaoled in Boston under Massachusetts law and publicly flogged, but went on to evangelize in Barbados among both the European and Afro-Caribbean populations. In one letter Alice reproved a plantation-owner for &#145;preventing thy Servants, whom thou callest thy Slaves&#146; from attending a Quaker meeting:<blockquote>for I am perswaded, that if they whom thou call'st thy Slaves, be Upright-hearted to God, the Lord God Almighty will set them Free in a way that thou knowest not; for there is none set free but in Christ Jesus, for all other Freedom will prove but a Bondage. (<span class="italic">A Relation</span>, 18)</blockquote>Following their return to England the Curwens continued their preaching work in London, the south-east, and the east midlands, though retaining their links with Furness and especially with Swarthmoor. In the winter of 1677&#150;8, when they were active in Huntingdonshire, Alice still gave their home as Baycliff and wrote a letter addressed to the Swarthmoor meeting.<br>
<br>Though &#145;she seemed not very aged and but a few days before appeared a healthy strong woman&#146;  (R. T., &#145;A testimony concerning Alice Curwen&#146;, in <span class="italic">A Relation</span>, unpag.), Alice Curwen died in London &#145;on the 7th Day of the 6th Moneth&#146; 1679, aged about sixty. Thomas Curwen contributed an entry in the obituary compilation in her memory, <span class="italic">A relation of the labour, travail and suffering of that faithful servant of the Lord Alice Curwen</span>, recalling her as &#145;a dread and a terror to the wicked where-ever she came &hellip; her children &hellip; were convinced by her wise walking before them&#146;  (Mack, 382). One of these children, Thomas, a Quaker London glover, maintained close business links with the Fells of Swarthmoor. Thomas Curwen died at Blackfriars, London, aged about seventy, on 1 August 1680, and was buried there. <span class="italic">A Relation</span>, which put together letters between the Curwens and colonial Friends, along with Thomas Curwen's &#145;Account of the suffgs. of Friends and breaking up a meeting in New England by warrant&#146; and &#145;The sufferings of Thomas Curwen which he hath suffered for conscience sake towards God&#146;, as well as a record by the Quaker writer Rebecca Travers of Alice Curwen's peaceable demise, provided a retrospect over the heroic work of this early north Lancashire Quaker couple of modest farming folk, propelled into a transatlantic mission.<br>
