<span class="headword">O'Hara,  Kane</span>  (1711/12&#150;1782), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born at Templehouse in Connaught, the son of Kean O'Hara, a squire and member of an ancient Sligo family. Young O'Hara received his early schooling from the Revd William Jackson at Mount Temple and entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 3 March 1728, aged sixteen, receiving his BA in spring 1732 and his MA in summer 1735. O'Hara is listed in university records as a pensioner, that is, a person of moderate income.<br>
<br>O'Hara's first professional play was <span class="italic">Midas, an English Burletta</span>, which had its premi&egrave;re production at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, on 22 January 1762. <span class="italic">Midas</span> was a clever, chauvinistic response to the success of a touring Italian troupe, the D'Amici family, which had brought a lively production of an Italian burletta to the Smock Alley Theatre on 19 December 1761. The Italian burletta, a slight comic opera already modish on the continent, captivated Dubliners with its simple domestic plot and brisk galante music.<br>
<br>Lord Mornington, Garrett Colley Wellesley, father of the future duke of Wellington and then professor of music at Trinity College, urged O'Hara to respond to the Italian performers. O'Hara revised his slight mock pastoral <span class="italic">Midas</span>, which had been privately performed for William Brownlow MP at Lough Neagh, near Lurgan, co. Armagh, in April 1760. The Irish playwright John O'Keeffe recalled that, as a young boy, he was present at O'Hara's house in King Street, Stephen's Green, one morning when the three gentlemen, O'Hara, Lord Mornington, and Brownlow were settling the music for <span class="italic">Midas</span>  (O'Keeffe, 1.53). O'Hara transformed his play into an eclectic <span class="italic">Midas</span>, incorporating the deities and the recitative aria musical pattern of Italian <i>opera seria</i> and the comic domestic plot and lively music of the Italian burletta, subtitling his play &#145;an English burletta&#146;. <span class="italic">Midas</span> delighted Dubliners and was brought to London's Covent Garden with only minor revisions. Performed as a mainpiece on 22 February 1764, it was soon revised to a two-act afterpiece and was performed over 200 times by 1800; it was generally believed to be superior to all subsequent English burlettas. O'Hara's creation of the burletta was significant because it bridged the gap musically between the early-century ballad opera and the later, technically sophisticated, comic opera.<br>
<br>O'Hara's second burletta, <span class="italic">The Golden Pippin</span>, was initially rejected by the lord chamberlain because of satirical references to members of the royal family, but, after excision of contemporary allusions, it enjoyed substantial popularity at Covent Garden. O'Hara's next two burlettas, <span class="italic">April Day</span> (1777, Haymarket), and <span class="italic">Tom Thumb</span> (1780, Covent Garden), abandoned the use of mythological figures but preserved the musical style of the burletta. O'Hara's <span class="italic">The Two Misers: a Musical Farce</span> (1775, Covent Garden), an adaptation of M. de Falbaire's <span class="italic">Les deux avares</span>, enjoyed only moderate success.<br>
<br>A serious amateur musician, in 1757 O'Hara had founded, with Lord Mornington, the Dublin Academy of Music and served as one of its officers, meeting at the Fishamble Street Music Hall on Wednesday evenings to prepare concerts for charitable causes. O'Hara also wrote musical compositions of different types; the National Library of Ireland holds manuscript copies of five of his works: &#145;Fussalia&#146; (1756), a musical masque; &#145;Isaac&#146; (1767), an oratorio; &#145;Cupid's Triumph&#146; (1768), a serenata; &#145;Orlando&#146; (1772); and &#145;Tom Thumb the Great&#146; (1774), a puppet show opera (MSS 9248, 9251, 9252, 9258, 9259).<br>
<br>In 1774 O'Hara established Mr Punch's Patagonian Theatre in a house in Abbey Street, Dublin, where the Irish tenor, Michael Kelly, as a young boy, sang the role of Daphne in <span class="italic">Midas</span>, &#145;instructed by the author himself&#146;  (Kelly, 19). The proceeds from all performances were given to charity. The Patagonian Theatre moved to Exeter Change, London, in October 1776, where it successfully presented puppet show performances of ballad operas, burlesques, and burlettas for five years.<br>
<br>O'Hara was a popular figure, respected in Dublin society as a successful playwright, skilful amateur musician, popular composer, and accomplished painter. Tall and lean, with slightly stooped shoulders, he was called by his friends &#145;St Patrick's Steeple&#146; and was considered &#145;a very necessary man in every party for amusement&#146;  (Molloy, 2, 153). Though he lost his eyesight in 1778, O'Hara retained an avid interest in theatre. John O'Keeffe, who recalled dining with him in 1781, noted his exquisite manners and described him as &#145;a first-rate wit&#146;  (O'Keeffe, 1.53). O'Hara died in Dublin on 17 June 1782.<br>
