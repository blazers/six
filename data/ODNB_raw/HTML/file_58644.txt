<span class="headword">Tiwana, Sir Khizr Hayat</span>  (1900&#150;1975), <span class="occ">prime minister of the Punjab</span>, was born on 7 August 1900 in Chak Muzaffarabad, Sargodha, in the Shahpur district, Punjab, India. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36527/', "Umar Hayat Khan Tiwana (1874&#150;1944)")</script>&#151;an honorary major-general in the Tiwana lancers (later the 19th (King George's own) lancers) who saw active service both in France with the Indian expeditionary force and in Mesopotamia during the First World War&#151;and his wife, Fateh Khatun. The General, as his father was commonly called, was the family patriarch and exerted a profound influence on Khizr's life. The Tiwanas were Rajputs who had entered the Shahpur region nearly seven centuries earlier from Rajputana. Khizr was descended from the cadet Mitha Tiwana branch. It rose to prominence after the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848&#150;9) and the 1857 Indian mutiny. The family's prosperous Kalra estate was carved out of crown wasteland awarded to Khizr's grandfather Malik Sahib Khan. It was greatly developed during Umar's minority, when it was administered by the court of wards.<br>
<br>Khizr entered Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore, in 1908, and later attended Government College, Lahore. He volunteered for military service at the time of the 1919 Punjab disturbances and was attached to the 17th lancers, which guarded Government House and other public buildings in Lahore. He accompanied the regiment to the front at the time of the Third Afghan War. Although still only a teenager, he earned a mention in dispatches and was appointed OBE in 1921. For the next fifteen years he devoted himself to the running of the Kalra estate. He married his first wife, Sultan Bibi, daughter of a kinsman, Malik Muzaffar Khan, and took Fateh Bibi, the wife of one of his tenants, as a mistress. Khizr eventually married her, although this was kept a secret from Umar for many years. With his father Khizr attended the 1935 silver jubilee celebrations in London of George V and Queen Mary.<br>
<br>Khizr stood for the Khushab constituency in the 1937 Punjab provincial elections after the devolution of provincial power to Indian hands after the 1935 <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span>. Despite his lack of experience he became minister of public works and local self-government in Sir Sikander Hayat-Khan's Unionist cabinet. In 1939 he also took charge of the manpower committee of the Punjab war board and the civil defence departments. Sikander and the prominent Hindu Jat leader Sir Chhotu Ram chalked out a programme of agrarian reform which curbed the power of the moneylenders and cemented the Unionist Party's rural intercommunal appeal. Its support from the Punjab's three major communities, Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh, had been a unique feature of the region's politics since the party's foundation in 1923. The Unionists' subsequent channelling of political divisions in the countryside along rural&#150;urban rather than communal lines severely handicapped the Muslim League's development.<br>
<br>Sikander's celebrated pact with M. A. Jinnah in 1937, in which a Muslim assembly member could be simultaneously recognized as a Unionist and a Muslim Leaguer, in fact ensured a close Unionist supervision of the Muslim League organization in the province. The ambiguities surrounding the pact were, however, to be later exploited by Jinnah in his tussle with Khizr in April 1944. Khizr became prime minister after Sikander's sudden death in December 1942. Growing economic dislocation had already undermined the Unionists' popularity. The Muslim League increasingly sought power in the geographical &#145;cornerstone&#146; of Pakistan. Behind the 1944 tussle over the interpretation of the Sikander&#150;Jinnah pact there existed two conflicting accommodationist and communalist visions of Punjab politics.<br>
<br>Jinnah journeyed to Lahore in March 1944 for negotiations which were temporarily suspended after Umar's death on 24 March. Despite this family tragedy Khizr resumed the discussions on 20 April. When they finally collapsed he was unprecedentedly expelled from the All-India Muslim League.<br>
<br>Khizr refused to compromise because of loyalty to his non-Muslim colleagues. He had also been encouraged to resist Jinnah by the governor, Sir Bertrand Glancy, who feared that a Muslim League ministry would disrupt the war effort. Khizr relied increasingly on Glancy's advice, after the severe blow of Chhotu Ram's death in January 1945, but he later felt that the British had let him down in their dealings with Jinnah, particularly at the time of the July 1945 Simla conference. From then on Khizr was accused of betraying the Pakistan cause. After the 1946 elections the Unionist Party was reduced to a rump of eighteen members in the assembly of 175. The Muslim League was the single largest party, but could not form a government in an increasingly polarized situation. Despite the protests of the League, Sir Bertrand Glancy invited Khizr to form a coalition Unionist, Akali, and Congress ministry on 7 March 1946.<br>
<br>Khizr attended the Paris peace conference between 29 July and 15 October 1946. He was, however, an increasingly isolated figure in Punjab politics: the Muslim League launched a direct action campaign on 25 January 1947 in response to the banning of the Muslim League national guards, and the agitation revealed the unpopularity of the coalition government. Khizr only finally resigned, however, after Attlee's announcement of 20 February that the British would quit India by June 1948. The Unionist departure precipitated an outbreak of serious communal disturbances; the Sikh desire to avenge these attacks contributed to the later communal holocaust of August 1947. Khizr's warnings that partition would unleash widespread violence were chillingly vindicated.<br>
<br>Khizr feared for his safety and only entered Pakistan in October 1949, after a period of self-imposed exile in London. Unlike other Muslim Unionists, he never again resumed public life. His remaining years were spent at Kalra and in travel to Britain and the United States. He was knighted in 1946. As his economic fortunes declined he entered into two further unsuccessful marriages. Khizr died near Chico, Glen County, California, on 20 January 1975. His body was flown home for burial four days later in the family graveyard at Kalra.<br>
<br>Khizr's legacy lies in his style of statecraft. His natural tolerance and flexibility enabled him to practise intuitively a consociational system of power-sharing based on decentralization in political representation and government appointments, and cross-communal coalition building. Significantly, the abandonment of such traditions of political accommodation has been accompanied in contemporary south Asia by a recrudescence of communal and ethnic violence. Khizr's attachment to the politics of accommodation is likely to be of increasing interest in a critical reappraisal of the partition era.<br>
