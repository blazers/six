<span class="headword">Montgomery,  Henry Hutchinson</span>  (1847&#150;1932), <span class="occ">bishop of Tasmania and missionary society administrator</span>, was born on 3 October 1847 at Cawnpore, North-Western Provinces, India, the second of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19075/', "Sir Robert Montgomery (1809&#150;1887)")</script>, lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, and his second wife, Ellen Jane (1824&#150;1920), daughter of William Lambert JP, an administrator in India. After an evangelical preparatory education he entered Harrow School in 1861 where he imbibed public-school athleticism as &#145;a real education for life&#146;  (M. Montgomery, 9). He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in the autumn of 1866, graduated BA in 1869, and subsequently prepared for ordination in London under the conservative churchman Charles Vaughan, master of the Temple. Ordained deacon 1871 and priest in 1872, he was successively curate at Hurstpierpoint, Sussex (1871&#150;4), Christ Church, Southwark, London (1874&#150;6), and St Margaret's, Westminster (1876&#150;9), and priest at St Mark's, Kennington (1879&#150;89), where he was known for his comprehensive organization of the parish. At St Margaret's he associated closely with the popular author and broad church evangelical Canon (later Dean) Frederick William Farrar and became the intimate and secretary to the dean of Westminster, A. P. Stanley, sympathizing with his commitment to the ideal of a comprehensive national church. On 28 July 1881 he married Maud (1864&#150;1949), Farrar's third daughter, who came to command the domestic affairs of the family; they had three daughters and six sons, the most notable being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31460/', "Bernard Law Montgomery")</script>, the future field marshal and first Viscount Montgomery of Alamein.<br>
<br>Henry Montgomery was consecrated bishop of Tasmania on 1 May 1889 and took up residence in Hobart, throwing his considerable energy and visionary enthusiasm into diocesan reorganization and especially missionary work. While Montgomery nearly doubled the number of churches in his diocese, many of his other initiatives were frustrated by lay apathy, economic recession, and party opposition from radical evangelicals who suspected him of ritualism. He nevertheless became an important advocate of invigorating colonial Anglicanism and extending its pan-imperial connections, particularly emphasizing global missionary co-operation in the Australian board of missions and synod. Because of his activism, in July 1901 he was appointed by a committee of six English bishops, led by his friend and Harrow schoolmate Randall Davidson of Winchester, to the secretaryship of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Despite misgivings over abandoning his colonial bishopric, Montgomery became convinced of the importance of creating &#145;a sort of Foreign Office&#146; for world Anglicanism at the SPG  (circular letter, autumn 1901, Temple MSS, vol. 49, fols. 115&#150;16).<br>
<br>Montgomery's impact at the SPG as a reformer was substantial. A traditional high-church society, the SPG did not cater to the party enthusiasms of either evangelicals or Anglo-Catholics. In order to dispel well-known lethargy at the SPG, Montgomery allied himself with progressive younger clergy and female supporters. Despite opposition from an &#145;old guard&#146;, he drew activists into a reorganized central administration, launched new publications, built a new society headquarters proximate to Church House in Westminster, emulated and co-operated with Anglican evangelicals, and established a new emphasis at the SPG on service to the British empire. Broad in his religious views, warm in his spirituality, and generous in his humour, Montgomery sought to recreate the Church of England as an &#145;Imperial Church&#146;  (Montgomery to SPG standing committee, 17 Aug 1901, Davidson MSS, vol. 151, fols. 322&#150;3) in order to increase enthusiasm for foreign missions, remedy Anglican party factionalism, and reverse the decline of Anglican observance and ordination. As the archbishop of Canterbury's (Davidson) adviser on foreign missions, he proposed and led arrangements for the Pan-Anglican Congress of 1908. In 1902 Montgomery was made prebendary of St Paul's, in 1906 prelate of the Order of St Michael and St George, and a knight commander of the order in 1928. Under his guidance SPG incomes increased sharply, and the society gained a new reputation for innovation. Yet his more ambitious goal of creating imperial unity in the church was thwarted by the local preoccupations of Anglican clergy, differences within the communion over imperial methods and attitudes to race, and the re-emergence of tension between Anglican evangelicals and high-churchmen, especially following the 1913 Kikuyu Controversy in east Africa. In this final evangelical/high-church controversy of the pre-war period, in which the Anglo-Catholic bishop of Zanzibar accused the evangelical bishops of Mombasa and Uganda of heretically ecumenical associations with nonconformists, Montgomery retreated from an earlier ecumenism out of fear for the authority and distinctiveness of the Anglican communion.<br>
<br>Montgomery served the SPG with patriotic verve through the war years, and finally resigned the secretaryship in 1918, retiring in 1921 to the family property at New Park, Moville, co. Donegal. He spent his final decade in occasional church and SPG work, and writing. He died at New Park on 25 November 1932, and was buried in the Moville church cemetery on 30 November. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Montgomery was the author of twenty-five books on theological or missionary subjects, most notably <span class="italic">The Light of Melanesia</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Foreign Missions</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Life's Journey</span> (1916), and <span class="italic">Life and Letters of George Alfred Lefroy</span> (1920).<br>
