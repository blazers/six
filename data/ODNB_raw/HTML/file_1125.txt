<span class="headword">Baker,  John</span>  (1660&#150;1716), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was a son of James Baker (<i>d</i>. before 1666), a mariner of Deal, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1715). He was appointed second lieutenant of the <i>Woolwich</i> on 14 November 1688, became captain of the <i>Mary Galley</i> on 12 October 1691, and was noted in the following year as a client of Henry Priestman, a commissioner of the Admiralty. During the remainder of the Nine Years' War (1689&#150;97) he successively commanded the <i>Boyne</i>, <i>Newcastle</i>, <i>Resolution</i>, and <i>Falmouth</i>, usually in the Mediterranean, and was captain of the <i>Medway</i> in peacetime, from 1697 to 1700. He commanded the <i>Pembroke</i> in 1701&#150;2 and then the <i>Monmouth</i> from March 1702 to January 1707, fighting in her at Vigo (1702), Gibraltar and Malaga (1704), Barcelona (1705), and Toulon (1707).<br>
<br>Promoted rear-admiral of the white on 26 January 1708, Baker flew his flag in the <i>Monmouth</i> as second-in-command to Sir George Byng during that year's operations, convoying troops from Dunkirk and then patrolling off Scotland as part of the counter-measures to the attempted Franco-Jacobite invasion. He then carried the new queen of Portugal, the Holy Roman emperor's daughter, from the Netherlands to Spithead, before taking her on to Lisbon in company with Byng. In 1709 he hoisted his flag in the <i>Stirling Castle</i> for an expedition to North America, but after this was cancelled his force was switched to the Mediterranean, where he arrived in October. In November he was detached to Lisbon, flying his flag in the <i>Somerset</i>, to protect incoming Portuguese trade from the Indies. Baker remained in the Mediterranean throughout 1711 and 1712, and returned to England at the peace, when he became MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. Despite being unseated on petition in 1714 he was re-elected in the following year. Politically he was closely associated with his naval patron, Byng, and thereby with the whigs and the earl of Orford's Admiralty administration.<br>
<br>In May 1715 Baker sailed for the Mediterranean once more with orders to check the activities of the North African corsairs. He negotiated treaties with Tripoli and Tunis, and was also involved in building up the infrastructure of the newly acquired naval base at Port Mahon, Minorca. In April 1716 the Jacobite duke of Leeds, whose flag-captain Baker had been, suggested offering him an earldom, &pound;200,000, an admiral's flag, and the position of commander-in-chief, if he would bring his squadron over to James Francis Edward Stuart, the Pretender, but Baker's squadron was recalled before the offer could be made.<br>
<br>Having only just been relieved, Baker died at Port Mahon on 10 November 1716. He was buried at Westminster Abbey, where his monument describes him as &#145;a brave, judicious and experienced officer, a sincere friend, and a true lover of his country&#146;. On several occasions during his career he expressed genuine concern for the well-being of his men, and in his will he bequeathed &pound;2000 for the relief of his poor relatives. The diamond rings given him by the queen of Portugal and the Holy Roman empress were bequeathed to Orford and Byng respectively. Having never married, Baker made over all his lands to his nephew Hercules Baker, a captain under him in 1715, MP for Hythe from 1722 to 1744, and treasurer of Greenwich Hospital from 1736 to 1744.<br>
