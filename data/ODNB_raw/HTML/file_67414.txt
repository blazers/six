<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Huxley,  Michael Heathorn</span>  (1899&#150;1979), <span class="occ">diplomatist and editor</span>, was born on 9 August 1899 at 39 Leinster Gardens, Bayswater, London, the third child of Henry Huxley (1865&#150;1946), general practitioner, and his wife, Sophy Wylde, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stobart (1865&#150;1927), daughter of William Stobart, a Durham colliery owner. As a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14320/', "Thomas Henry Huxley")</script>, much was expected of him. He followed his brother Gervas (1894&#150;1971) to Rugby School and studied natural science at Trinity College, Cambridge, apparently intending to follow a career in medicine according to his mother's wishes. He studied for a year at Cambridge and passed a preliminary examination in elementary physics in June 1917 but left the university to join the army in February 1918. He was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards in July 1918, though he did not see active service during the First World War. His love of languages inspired an early desire to travel, and having relinquished his commission in 1920 he spent some time living in continental Europe and learning German, French, Spanish, and Russian. In 1922 he joined the diplomatic service (in which his cousin Laurence Collier was also employed), serving in Tehran, Washington, and London (including the central European department and the news department).<br>
<br>On 24 April 1926, at the parish church in Beaulieu, Hampshire (with Lord Montagu of Beaulieu as a witness), Huxley married Ottilie de Lotbini&egrave;re Mills (1902&#150;1991), daughter of the retired colonel Dudley Acland Mills and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Joly de Lotbini&egrave;re, whose father, Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini&egrave;re, had been premier of Quebec. They had three children, Selma, Thomas, and Henry. From 1929 to 1932 Huxley lived with his family in Washington, where he established many lifelong friendships with diplomats and politicians, including Vincent Massey and Dean Acheson. There the Huxleys led a busy social life: the orientalist Denison Ross, who stayed for a week with them in the winter of 1931, later recalled Ottilie as &#145;the <i>belle</i> of the Diplomatic Corps&#146;  (Ross, 217). After returning to England, they built a house named Longmore at Bosham, near Chichester, in which they entertained many visitors from Britain and overseas including serving and former diplomats, writers, publishers, and academics, as well as members of the extended Huxley family, notably Gervas, his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64695/', "Elspeth Huxley")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31271/', "Julian Huxley")</script>. Ottilie's sociability ensured that Longmore effectively became an extension of Michael's workplace as well as a family home. Frequent visitors included the historian Eileen Power; Rex Leeper and Charles Peake of the Foreign Office news department; the publisher Harold Raymond and his wife, Vera; the American geographer Owen Lattimore and his wife, Eleanor; the film-makers Robert and Frances Flaherty; and in later years Lawrence Kirwan, director of the Royal Geographical Society, and his wife, Stella.<br>
<br>In 1934, having pondered the decision at length, Huxley resigned from the Foreign Office. For several years, he had been working on a project which became his life's main work: the establishment and editorship of the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span>. Impressed with the success of the <span class="italic">National Geographic</span>, but convinced of the need for a specifically British and higher-quality variant, he approached the Royal Geographical Society for support in 1931. He obtained backing from a number of wealthy businessmen, bankers, and diplomats, and after extended negotiations he finally succeeded in securing a publisher, Chatto and Windus, agreeable to his idea of devoting half of any profits to a fund for the promotion of geographical knowledge. Senior directors of Chatto, including Harold Raymond, a family friend, took a personal interest in the <span class="italic">Magazine</span>; under the terms of the publishing agreement, they were also shareholders. First published in 1935, it proved a commercial success in its early years, with a circulation of 50,000 in October 1939, exceeding expectations.<br>
<br>Huxley's work for the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span> was interrupted by his return to government service during the Second World War. Initially he worked as an intermediary between Sir Campbell Stuart's secretly funded Foreign Office propaganda unit at Electra House (a forerunner of the political warfare executive) and the Ministry of Information. He was also involved at this time, with his cousin Julian, in helping Max Nicholson to draft a far-reaching statement by the political and economic planning group on European order and world order. In January 1940 he made a visit to Washington apparently on behalf of Sir Campbell Stuart, returning to London in March to make final preparations for a new position as press attach&eacute; to Lord Lothian, British ambassador in Washington, with additional responsibility for the British Library of Information in New York. Lothian regarded Huxley's appointment as crucial to his efforts to present the British case in the United States. It was with his personal backing that Huxley returned with his family to Washington in April 1940. Much of his work in Washington was behind the scenes, though he also took part in more public activities: in July 1940, for example, he addressed 3000 Polish Americans at a banquet in Rochester, New York, declaring, &#145;Poland has been overrun for the last time. We shall win Europe back from darkness and we shall build there a system in which there will be no conquerors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dunkirk Evening Observer</span> [NY], 8 July 1940).<br>
<br>From September 1940 Huxley had the task of establishing the Inter-Allied Information Committee and Centre, based in the Rockefeller building in New York, where he worked for a year. Originally a product of the British propaganda effort, designed to co-ordinate the publicity activities of representatives of allied governments in occupied Europe, the committee developed into an effective information bureau, a direct forerunner of the United Nations Information Organisation. Also based in the Rockefeller building was the headquarters of British Security Coordination established by the Canadian industrialist Sir William Stephenson, which controlled clandestine intelligence operations, including black propaganda and the recruitment of agents for missions behind enemy lines. While there is no evidence that Huxley had any direct involvement in these operations, his Italian cousin Max Salvadori (a professor at St Lawrence University, New York, who visited Huxley's Sussex home in January 1940) was recruited by Stephenson and proved to be one of his most prized agents.<br>
<br>After his return to London in December 1941 Huxley sought further employment in government service. In 1942, with the support of Vincent Massey, now Canadian high commissioner in London, he visited RAF bases across Canada on behalf of the British Council. His report on the education of service personnel resulted in the establishment of what was known as the Canadian Committee, the forerunner of the Canada Foundation, devoted to the promotion of public understanding of Canadian culture. For the remainder of the war years, he worked in various posts concerned with information and post-war reconstruction attached to the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office, and as British representative to the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education, the predecessor of UNESCO, which considered a wide variety of issues from the restitution of looted artworks to the provision of scientific equipment and libraries in post-war Europe.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Huxley returned to the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span>, which had been sustained during wartime by a talented editorial team, including Ivy Davison and John Lehmann. By 1945 the magazine's profits were yielding dividends to its shareholders as well as supplying a small fund in support of expeditions and other worthy geographical causes. Huxley was not interested in publishing for an academic audience: rather he wanted contributors who could breathe life into the dry bones of geography, to communicate the feel as well as the facts of the relationship between people and places. His extensive networks in literary and political circles, combined with his punctilious editorial style and a strong personal commitment to the <span class="italic">Magazine</span>, left their mark on its contents during his long period of editorship, which finally came to an end with his retirement in 1959. Balancing the interests of founder, publisher, advertisers, shareholders, and trustees proved increasingly difficult, especially after 1956 when <span class="italic">The Times</span> became the <span class="italic">Magazine</span>'s publisher. However, Huxley continued to take a strong interest in its fortunes and in its management well after his retirement as editor, seeking to ensure that it remained faithful to his founding vision. In 1958 the Royal Geographical Society conferred on him an honorary fellowship in recognition of his dedication to and generous support of geography.<br>
<br>The creation of the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span> was Huxley's most significant achievement. It was neither an academic journal nor a wholly commercial publication, its contents and style reflecting the values of its founding editor at least until the 1960s, and the peculiar circumstances of its foundation left a lasting legacy. In comparison Huxley's contributions in public service went largely unrecognized. Yet the Inter-Allied Information Committee which he established played its part in sustaining support for the British cause at a critical moment in the war, and also provided a powerful model for international co-operation in the United Nations era. Perhaps strangely for a diplomat, compromise did not come easily to him: according to one obituarist, &#145;He was a man who stood adamantly by his own high moral and intellectual standards&#146;  (obituary, <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, 145 1979). In his later years he faced considerable personal difficulties, including the death of his younger son in 1968. His final years were spent in quiet retirement at Lodsworth on the South Downs. He died of prostate cancer at the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex, on 7 January 1979, and was survived by his wife, Ottilie, and two children.<br>
