<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Featley <span class="st"> [Fairclough]</span>,  Daniel</span>  (1582&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born on 5 March 1582 in Charlton-on-Otmoor, Oxfordshire, the second of the five children of John Fairclough and his wife, Marian Thrift. On 27 June 1590 he was admitted as a chorister of Magdalen College, Oxford, where his father was a college servant. At the age of twelve &#145;he gained no small credit and applause by the Latine and Greek verses which he frequently, wittily and elegantly composed&#146;  (Featley, 8). He was admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College, to which his father had also moved, on 13 December 1594, graduated BA on 13 February 1601, and was appointed a probationer fellow of the college on 20 September 1602. Some of his early writings survive in manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MSS Rawlinson C.753 and D.47), including notes &#145;ex Whitakeri responsione ad decem rationes Edm. Campioni&#146; written in 1601, lists of books read in 1604 and 1605, and a sermon preached at the funeral of John Rainolds in 1607. His first published work, commissioned by Thomas Morton, was an abridgement of Laurence Humphrey's life of Bishop John Jewel, published in the 1609 edition of Jewel's <span class="italic">Works</span>.<h2>
<a name="Protestantcontroversialistandearlypreferment"></a>Protestant controversialist and early preferment</h2>In 1610 Featley was recommended by the vice-chancellor, John King, to the English ambassador to Paris, Sir Thomas Edmondes, who appointed him as his household chaplain. He spent the next three years in Paris, where he built up a formidable reputation as a protestant controversialist: his friend William Leo (also known as Loe) wrote that the Jesuits in Paris &#145;contemned him for that he was of so low a stature, yet admired him for his ready answers, and acute distinctions&#146;  (Leo, 23) and Featley himself claimed that Cardinal Perron had attempted &#145;to inveagle him to Popery, by promise of far greater preferments than ever he could expect in England&#146;  (D. Featley, <span class="italic">Sacra nemesis, the Levites Scourge</span>, 1644, 66). The sermons that he preached in Edmondes's house were later published in his <span class="italic">Clavis mystica</span> (1636). They include a stinging attack on another English minister, Benjamin Carier, for his &#145;Laodicean temper in religion&#146;; a marginal note records that Carier had &#145;preached a scandalous Sermon in Paris at Luxenburg house, and not long after reconciled himself to the Romish Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clavis mystica</span>, 3&times;6<i>r</i>). Featley also took part in several disputations, including one on 4 September 1612 with Richard Smith, later bishop of Chalcedon, on the subject of transubstantiation, later published in <span class="italic">The Grand Sacrilege of the Church of Rome</span> (1630), and another with Christopher Bagshaw on the same subject, attended by Lord Clifford, Sir Edward Somerset, and &#145;divers other persons of great quality both English and French&#146;, and later published in <span class="italic">Transubstantiation Exploded</span> (1638). According to Leo, Featley was still remembered twenty-five years later by some of his opponents &#145;with reverentiall respect for his accute and ready Disputation&#146;  (Leo, 23).<br>
<br>In July 1613 Featley visited Oxford to take the degree of BD. He had intended to return to Paris, but decided to remain in England in order to take up the living of North-hill, Cornwall, which had been offered to him by one of his former pupils, Ezekiel Arscot. The benefice was worth &pound;150 per annum, and Featley later claimed to have accepted it merely to &#145;relieve my private wants&#146;. He soon came to regret his decision, writing to George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, that &#145;I cannot but lay blame on my sudden resolution to accept this benefice rather than to returne unto France according to your Grace's better advise&#146;, and to Robert Abbot, bishop of Salisbury, that he hoped it would &#145;please God to remove me out of this barren and thirsty soyle and settle me near the wellsprings of knowledge, that I may quench my thirst of controversy-learning&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D.47, fol. 41). In 1614, when Richard Mocket, chaplain to Archbishop Abbot, was promoted to the wardenship of All Souls College, Oxford, Featley made a bid to succeed him, declaring that he was well qualified for the post of archiepiscopal chaplain, both &#145;in regard of my experience beyond the sea and particular correspondencies with the greatest clerks in those parts&#146; and &#145;my long travaile in the controversies of religion, wherewith we are little troubled at Northill&#146;  (ibid., fol. 50). In 1617 Abbot appointed him as one of his household chaplains, and on 6 February 1619 he was presented to the rectory of All Saints, Lambeth, immediately adjacent to the archbishop's residence at Lambeth Palace.<h2>
<a name="Archbishopschaplainandecclesiasticallicenser16171625"></a>Archbishop's chaplain and ecclesiastical licenser, 1617&#150;1625</h2>As Abbot's chaplain, one of Featley's principal duties was to license books for the press, and from 1617 to 1625 he was one of the most active of the ecclesiastical licensers. He interpreted his role in broad terms, and seems to have acted not merely as a censor but also as a literary agent and adviser to inexperienced authors, one of whom, Simon Birkbeck, acknowledged his help in the preface to <span class="italic">The Protestants Evidence</span> (1634): &#145;hee (I thanke him) was readie to resolve me when I was in doubt, and to direct mee, (yea and correct mee also) when I was at default&#146;. Featley was sympathetic to puritan authors, and succeeded in getting a number of puritan works into print with only minimal corrections. In one case, William Hart's <span class="italic">The Three Conformities</span> (1620), a translation of a work by Francis de Croy, it is possible to reconstruct Featley's alterations by comparing the printed version with a pre-publication manuscript (Beinecke Library, Yale, Osborn MS b. 280); this shows that Featley cut one entire chapter on &#145;Archbishoprickes, Bishoprickes and other Popish dignities&#146; but made only minor changes to other passages which were implicitly critical of the ceremonies of the Church of England. In the wake of the Synod of Dort (1618) he also helped to arbitrate and moderate a number of theological disputes between puritan ministers, supplying conciliatory prefaces to several works including William Chibald's <span class="italic">The Trial of Faith</span> (1623) and Ezekiel Culverwell's <span class="italic">Treatise of Faith</span> (2nd edn, 1623).<br>
<br>Featley continued to take an active part in anti-Catholic controversy, and participated in several more disputations, including one with George Musket on 21 April 1621 and another with a Dr Eglestone on 18 April 1623, both printed in <span class="italic">An Appendix to the Fishers Net</span> (1624). In June 1623 he joined forces with Francis White in a debate with the Jesuit priests John Percy (alias Fisher) and John Sweet, held at Sir Humphrey Lynde's house in London and attended by a large audience including the earls of Lincoln and Warwick, Sir Henry Hastings, and Featley's fellow-chaplain Thomas Goad. The question at issue was &#145;whether the Protestant Church was in all ages visible, and especially in the ages going before Luther; and whether the names of such visible Protestants in all ages can be shewed and prooved out of good Authors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Romish Fisher</span>, C3<i>v</i>, p. 14). The debate seems to have been a somewhat chaotic affair: at one stage the Catholics in the audience started chanting &#145;Names, names, names&#146;, to which Featley retorted: &#145;What? Will nothing content you but a Buttery-booke?&#146; The sensitive political negotiations over the Spanish match caused the debate to be halted prematurely, and both sides subsequently claimed victory: Featley published his account of it in <span class="italic">The Fisher Catched in his Owne Net</span> (1623) and <span class="italic">The Romish Fisher Caught and Held in his Owne Net</span> (1624). The latter pamphlet was licensed for publication by Featley himself, but William Bedell reported to Samuel Ward on 1 June 1624 that it was &#145;not yet permitted to be sold&#146; because Richard Neile, bishop of Durham, had taken personal offence at a passage in which the premature ending of the debate was blamed on &#145;some, that tooke on them the office of the Divell who is the accuser of the bretheren&#146;  (Shuckburgh, 262).<br>
<br>Featley was strongly opposed to the Arminian school of theology, which he regarded as dangerously close to semi-Pelagianism and Roman Catholicism. He may have been the &#145;Oxford man, chaplein to the Archbishop&#146; mentioned by Joseph Mede in a letter of 25 April 1623, who preached a visitation sermon &#145;wondrous plainly and vehemently against the fearfull or flattering silence of our Clergie&#146;, warning that &#145;the hope of a crosier staffe or a Cardinalls hatt would make many a Scholler in England beat his braine to reconcile the Church of Rome and England&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 389, fol. 318). He was particularly scandalized by Richard Mountague's assertion that the Church of Rome could be considered a true church of Christ, and wrote a short treatise in reply, &#145;Certain doubts of S.B. resolved by Dr Daniel Featley, against popery, asserting the protestant church to be the onely Catholick and true church&#146;, though this did not appear in print until 1660. He also published several pamphlets in response to Mountague's <span class="italic">Appello Caesarem</span> (1625), including <span class="italic">Parallelismus nov-antiqui erroris pelagiarminiani</span> (1626), <span class="italic">Pelagius redivivus</span> (1626), and <span class="italic">A Second Parallel, together with a Writ of Error Sued Against the Appealer</span> (1626); he later claimed that by writing <span class="italic">Pelagius redivivus</span> he had &#145;dashed all hopes of his preferment at court&#146;. Mountague for his part was bitterly hostile to Featley (&#145;that urchin&#146;) and resentful of his control over the licensing process, complaining to his friend John Cosin that Featley &#145;told me once, if I did not correct my booke voluntarily, I should be forced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Cosin</span>, 1.50). In another of his letters to Cosin he referred to &#145;that hobby-horse Featly&#146;, who &#145;will, as he hath formerly done, crouch and fawne, and wind himself out. It were not amisse he were smoked&#146;  (ibid., 1.100).<br>
<br>In 1625 Featley got into trouble over the licensing of two books by puritan authors, William Crompton's <span class="italic">Saint Austins Summes</span> (1625) and Edward Elton's <span class="italic">Gods Holy Mind</span> (1625). Elton's book was called in, and 900 copies of it were burned at Paul's Cross on 13 February 1625. Mountague wrote to Cosin expressing amazement that Featley should ever have granted the book a licence: &#145;were not the Dr's braynes made of the papp of an apple that would allow such stuff to the presse? It is well the books made a fire, though not all, I doubt. But they are not burned that made the books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Cosin</span>, 1.61). Featley was summoned before King James and officially reprimanded: according to his subsequent account of the meeting in <span class="italic">Cygnea cantio</span> (1629), the king &#145;seemed to be very much displeased that any should be permitted to print books in the Church of England, who were not conformable to the discipline of the Church of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cygnea cantio</span>, B3<i>r</i>). Featley's defence was that he had only licensed the first few pages of Elton's book, and then &#145;made a stop&#146; when he learned that the author had died, &#145;yet the booke tooke the libertie to flie out of the Presse without licence&#146;; while he had deleted three entire sections of Crompton's book &#145;because they crossed the doctrine and discipline established in this Kingdome, and savoured of that humour which never yet bred good blood in the Church&#146;  (ibid., D3<i>v</i>), though, with hindsight, he admitted that he might have been better advised to have rejected the book completely. Some copies of <span class="italic">Cygnea cantio</span> contain a note by the printer, Robert Milbourne, accusing Cosin of having engineered the suppression of Elton's book; and the whole episode seems to have been an attempt by the Arminian faction to embarrass Featley and Abbot.<br>
<br>At Charles I's first parliament in 1625, Featley was elected a member of convocation, and became the leader of a group of forty-five clergy who agreed among themselves &#145;to oppose everything that did but savour or scent never so little of Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism&#146;. In August of that year, there was an outbreak of plague in London, and convocation was transferred to Oxford; but Featley then fell ill and was suspected of having contracted plague, though in truth &#145;his distemper was but a Cold&#146;. As William Leo, another member of convocation, later recalled:<blockquote>we were constrained to get him an horse, and two poore men travelled with him, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side did support and stay him up all the way, he travelling on foot pace, and so brought him home to Lambeth.</blockquote>On his arrival at Lambeth Abbot refused to admit him, and Featley returned to his own house in Kennington &#145;in much anguish and grief&#146;. After his recovery, &#145;he removed his Books and other goods from Lambeth Palace to his own house, and so deserted the service of his Lord&#146;  (Featley, H8<i>r</i>, p. 19). The most plausible interpretation of this rather mysterious episode is that Featley's licensing of Elton's book had made him a liability to Abbot, who therefore seized the opportunity to dismiss him. Perhaps in compensation, however, on 29 November 1626 Abbot presented him to the rectory of All Hallows, Bread Street, London, which he afterwards exchanged for the rectory of Acton, Middlesex, while remaining in possession of his living at Lambeth.<h2>
<a name="Familypietyandpublications16241636"></a>Family piety and publications, 1624&#150;1636</h2>In 1624 Featley had married one of his parishioners, Joyce Halloway (<i>d</i>. 1637), though he concealed the marriage while he was a member of Abbot's household. She was the daughter of William Kerwyn, citizen and mason of London, and widow successively of two London merchants, Richard Thompson and Isaac Halloway, and was described by Featley's biographer as &#145;an ancient grave Gentlewoman&#146;  (Featley, H6<i>r</i>, p. 15), considerably his senior. She lived in &#145;a handsom house of her own in Kennington in Lambeth parish&#146;, which she settled on her husband for life, as there was no parsonage house attached to the benefice. According to Thomas Gataker, who preached at her funeral in 1637, she was a pious and charitable woman, who &#145;read the whole <span class="roman">New Testament</span> twelve times over; and that, not slightly and superficially, but so as to observe somewhat that might be usefull unto her, either out of or upon every Chapter she read&#146;. She had &#145;pretie skill in matter of Physick and Chirurgie&#146;  (Gataker), and acted as physician and apothecary to her poorer neighbours; according to John Featley, she was also &#145;a great Florist&#146; who &#145;nourished a Garden which administered a sweet and delicate delight&#146;  (ibid.). She left the sum of &pound;340 to charitable uses, and &#145;a faire Communion Cup&#146; to the parish of Lambeth, &#145;to be raysed from the sale of some of her principall Jewels&#146;  (Gataker). Her house in Kennington was later the subject of protracted litigation, in which Joyce's nephew Andrew Kerwin sought to recover the copyhold from Featley  (Parl. Arch., main papers, 10 Dec 1640 and 30 June 1641).<br>
<br>During the plague epidemic of 1625&#150;6 Featley wrote <span class="italic">Ancilla pietatis, or, The Handmaid to Private Devotion</span> (1626), his most popular and least controversial work. As John Featley recalled, &#145;he was so sensible of the general calamity, that he laid by his Polemick Divinity, and wholly devoted himself to the study and practice of Piety and Charity&#146;  (Featley, H8<i>r</i>, p. 19). <span class="italic">Ancilla pietatis</span> was a collection of prayers for private use, written in the conviction that the sincere Christian ought to be &#145;more devout in private than in publike&#146;. Featley believed that while public prayer was &#145;more solemne&#146;, private prayer &#145;ought to be more frequent [&hellip;]. Publike makes more noise, but private (for the most part) hath a deeper channell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ancilla pietatis</span>, B3<i>v</i>). The book became one of the religious bestsellers of its day, reaching an eighth edition by 1656. It was translated into French and Dutch, and did more than any other work to give Featley an international reputation: in his <span class="italic">Sacra nemesis</span> (1644) he printed a letter from his Dutch translator, Wolfgang Meyer, declaring that his countrymen overseas &#145;confess they are much indebted to me for translating the works of Perkins, Willet, Downham, Squire and other English writers, but far more for the translation of your Devotions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sacra nemesis</span>, M3<i>r</i>, p. 85). The second, third, fourth and fifth editions were all augmented with additional material, including &#145;Directions for a private fast&#146;, &#145;A special confession to be used before the receiving of the sacrament&#146;, and &#145;A psalme of thanksgiving for women after their delivery&#146;; many copies are also found bound with a short catechism entitled <span class="italic">The Summe of Saving Knowledge</span> (1626).<br>
<br>Featley kept up a steady stream of publications in the later 1620s and 1630s. In <span class="italic">The Grand Sacrilege of the Church of Rome</span> (1630) he printed a report of a disputation with a Jesuit priest, Thomas Everard, held in 1628 in the presence of an unnamed nobleman who had been &#145;seduced by deceitfull guides &hellip; out of the right way into the Arminian tract, and afterward into the high road of Popery lying not farre off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grand Sacrilege</span>, preface). He also supplied a commendatory preface to the 1631 edition of Clement Cotton's <span class="italic">Christians Concordance</span>, explaining how concordances could be used to compile &#145;sacred collations or divine notes&#146; as well as to assist the memory. His most important publication was <span class="italic">Clavis mystica</span> (1636), a collection of sermons &#145;opening divers difficult and mysterious texts of Holy Scripture&#146;. With this work, Featley found himself on the receiving end of ecclesiastical censorship, as he recalled in his evidence at the trial of Archbishop William Laud in 1644. When <span class="italic">Clavis mystica</span> was about to be published, Laud summoned him to Lambeth and enquired whether his sermons had been licensed, to which &#145;he answered, that they were licensed long since when himselfe had power to license books, and printed by vertue of that license&#146;. Laud then ordered him to submit the sermons to his chaplain, William Bray, who &#145;gelt them exceedingly, and purged out all the smart and masculine passages against the Papists, Jesuits and Arminians&#146;, with the result that seventeen sheets had to be cancelled and reprinted  (Prynne, 2L1<i>v</i>). Some uncensored copies of the book have survived, and can be recognized by the absence of an errata list on the final page of text.<h2>
<a name="CivilwarandWestminsterassembly16421643"></a>Civil war and Westminster assembly, 1642&#150;1643</h2>This <i>contretemps</i> did not prevent Featley from being appointed a royal chaplain in the late 1630s; the lord chamberlain's accounts show that he preached twice before the king, on 29 March 1639 and 14 April 1641  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/134). About this time, according to his nephew, he was invited to become a professor of divinity at Leiden, but declined the offer, feeling himself &#145;unfit to alter his climate, by reason of age and other infirmities&#146;  (Featley, 15<i>v</i>, p. 38). When the civil war broke out, he did not follow the king to Oxford, but remained in London, where his high reputation as a theologian led to his appointment as a member of the Westminster assembly. Most of the episcopalian divines elected to the assembly, including Henry Hammond, Richard Holdsworth, and Featley's old Oxford teacher John Prideaux, regarded it as illegitimate because it had not been summoned by royal authority; and Featley was the only leading episcopalian to take his seat there. On 10 September 1642 he was requested by the Commons to answer a Roman Catholic treatise entitled <span class="italic">A Safeguard from Shipwracke to a Prudent Catholique</span>, which sought to prove that it was lawful for a Catholic to attend protestant services, receive communion, and take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. His reply was published as <span class="italic">Virtumnus Romanus</span> (1642), and consisted of a reprint of his opponent's work &#145;to lay open to the view of the world the detestable and damnable doctrine of Romish Priests and Jesuits&#146;, with an introduction and marginal notes by Featley &#145;by way of Antidote against those places where the rankest poyson is couched&#146;  (<span class="italic">Virtumnus Romanus</span>, preface). This work caused him some embarrassment at Laud's trial, where he was forced to admit that one passage had been censored for being &#145;somewhat sharpe against the Separatists&#146;  (Prynne, 343<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Despite his membership of the assembly Featley's religious views caused him to be regarded in many quarters as an enemy of the parliament. On 10 November 1642 a group of soldiers vandalized the church at Acton, breaking down the communion rails, pulling down the font, and smashing the windows; they also burnt down the tithe barn with its stock of corn, valued at &pound;211. On 19 February 1643 five soldiers entered the church at Lambeth, where they &#145;prophaned the church by walking with their hatts on in time of prayer, and taking Tobacco at the communion table&#146;, and then demanded to see Featley, threatening to &#145;squeeze the Pope out of the Doctor's belly&#146;  (Featley, I1<i>r</i>, p. 30). Featley had been warned of the danger and prudently kept out of the way, but one of his parishioners was killed on the spot and another mortally wounded in the ensuing fracas. Shortly before this incident a group of disgruntled parishioners had submitted a petition to the committee for plundered ministers, complaining that Featley had encouraged &#145;new ceremonies&#146; in the church at Lambeth, such as bowing at the name of Jesus and standing up at the <span class="italic">Gloria patri</span>, &#145;which many of his Parish practise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentle Lash</span>, B1<i>v</i>, p. 1). In a counter-petition submitted to the House of Lords in February 1643, Featley claimed that the opposition to him stemmed from a small group of &#145;obstinate separatists&#146;  (Parl. Arch., main papers, 23 Feb 1643), many of whom had not attended church for the past nine months. He gave further details in his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Gentle Lash</span> (1644), where he declared that his opponents were &#145;men of very meane ranke and quality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentle Lash</span>, E1<i>r</i>, p. 26), including a shipwright, a cobbler, and a waterman.<br>
<br>On 16 March 1643 Featley appeared before the committee for plundered ministers to answer the charges against him. He admitted that the communion table in Lambeth church was railed and set against the east wall in the Laudian style, but declared that &#145;it standeth as it did when I came first to the parish &hellip; and is the fittest place for it to stand in, that the communicants may best both heare and see the Minister at the Communion&#146;, adding that when the parishioners had been asked whether the rails should be removed, &#145;they cryed all with one accord, it is no innovation, let it stand, let it stand&#146;. He denied having said in a sermon &#145;that it was blasphemie and ignorance to speake against bowing at the Name of Jesus&#146;, but defended the gesture as a sign of &#145;inward humility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentle Lash</span>). These arguments did not satisfy the committee, which ordered Featley to be sequestered from the rectory of Lambeth; but when this order was referred to the Commons on 11 July 1643, it was put to the vote and defeated by sixty-nine votes to sixty. Laurence Whitacre, MP for Okehampton, noted in his diary that the order had been made &#145;for his Malignant preaching against the Parliament, and encouraging of those that were ill affected to it: but by reason of his good deserts to the Church heretofore, and because he was chosen one of the Synode, it would not passe&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 31116, fol. 62).<br>
<br>By this time Featley was becoming increasingly outspoken in his support for episcopacy. In one of his final speeches before the Westminster assembly he declared that, having received episcopal ordination, he could not vote against episcopacy without breaking his oath of obedience, and could not accept the solemn league and covenant unless its condemnation of &#145;prelacy&#146; was qualified in some way. With such views Featley's removal from his livings was only a matter of time and in September 1643 he fell victim to a classic &#145;sting&#146; operation when one Armiger Wardner, a feltmaker in Southwark, offered to carry a letter from him to Archbishop James Ussher at Oxford, and then denounced him to the authorities as a royalist spy&#151;although, judging by the contents of the letter, Featley was less interested in passing politically sensitive information to the royalist forces at Oxford than in pressing his own claims to ecclesiastical preferment. (His subsequent attempts to exonerate himself from the charge of place-seeking were embarrassingly lame: &#145;Put case, he did so &hellip; Is it a great fault for a Servant to begge of his Master?&#146; <span class="italic">Gentle Lash</span>, A3<i>r</i>). On 29 September the Commons expelled him from the assembly, voted him out of his livings, and ordered him to be imprisoned. Many observers felt he had been harshly treated, Richard Baxter commenting that &#145;whatever his Fact were, he was so Learned a Man, as was sufficient to dishonour those he suffered by&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.73). Featley himself attributed his expulsion from the assembly to the fact that he had opposed the covenant and &#145;sided with the Presbyterians against the Independents&#146; in the debate on the creeds  (<span class="italic">Sacra nemesis</span>, 4).<h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentandfinalyears"></a>Imprisonment and final years</h2>Featley was imprisoned in Lord Petre's house in Aldersgate Street, where he engaged in a final burst of literary activity. He published two self-justificatory memoirs, <span class="italic">Sacra nemesis, the Levites Scourge</span> (1644) and <span class="italic">The Gentle Lash, or, The Vindication of Dr Featley</span> (1644), in which he pleaded his credentials as a champion of &#145;the true reformed Religion&#146;: &#145;Did not he oppose Arminianisme when it was in its fullest Ruffe? And when the Crime was capitall to speake against it, were his lipps sealed?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentle Lash</span>, A3<i>v</i>). <span class="italic">The Gentle Lash</span> ends with a &#145;Manifesto and challenge&#146; in which Featley offers to maintain, &#145;by disputation or writing&#146;, the following three points: that the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> &#145;need no alteration at all, but onely an Orthodox explication in some ambiguous phrases, and a vindication against false aspersions&#146;; that episcopacy is &#145;a truly ancient and Apostolicall Institution&#146;; and that the prayer book &#145;is the most compleat, perfect and exact Liturgie now extant in the Christian world&#146;  (ibid., E4<i>r</i>, p. 31). He returned to his old anti-Catholic stamping-ground in <span class="italic">Roma ruens, Romes Ruine</span> (1644), a polemical work on the visibility of the Catholic church, written in response to a challenge from an unnamed &#145;Romanist&#146; whom Featley took to be &#145;some mendicant friar&#146;. He also set out his reasons for opposing the solemn league and covenant in a letter to &#145;my Noble and much Honored Friend, E.G.&#146;, published long after his death as <span class="italic">The League Illegal</span> (1660).<br>
<br>Another of his prison writings was <span class="italic">The Sea-Gull</span> (1644), published anonymously but attributed to Featley by his friend William Leo. This brief pamphlet concerned a painting seized from a ship &#145;neere Arundell Haven about Christmas last&#146;, which had been alleged by some parliamentarian writers to depict the king handing over the sceptre of his kingdom to the queen and the pope, but which, as Featley had no difficulty in demonstrating, was actually a representation of a story from the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span>, painted in Antwerp for the church of St Anne in Seville. Featley's final work, and the most important of his prison writings, was <span class="italic">The Dippers Dipt</span> (1645), based on notes taken in October 1642 at a disputation with the Baptist minister William Kiffin in Southwark, but greatly expanded to form a polemical history of the Anabaptist movement since the Reformation. Later editions of the work were enlarged with further material, including Featley's speeches before the Westminster assembly, and a striking frontispiece by William Marshall entitled &#145;The discription of the severall sorts of Anabaptists with their manner of rebaptizing&#146;: the central scene shows some naked &#145;Virgins of Sion&#146; being baptized in a river, flanked by a series of roundels depicting various sects and heresies, including the &#145;Separatist&#146;, the &#145;Enthusiast&#146;, the &#145;Libertine&#146;, and the &#145;Adamite&#146;. <span class="italic">The Dippers Dipt</span> was by far the most successful of Featley's controversial writings, provoking a reply from the Baptist minister Henry Denne, <span class="italic">Antichrist Unmasked</span> (1645), and reaching a sixth edition in 1651 and a seventh in 1660.<br>
<br>In March 1645 Featley was permitted to move to Chelsea College for the sake of his health. According to Leo, who visited him there shortly before his death, he was suffering from &#145;the Dropsie, which was on the left side of his face, and was falne into his left legge&#146;, and spoke &#145;with great shortnesse of breath&#146;  (Leo, F1<i>r</i>, p. 25). He died on 17 April, and was buried in Lambeth church on 21 April; his last words were &#145;The poor Church of God is torn in pieces&#146;. A few days before his death, he drew up &#145;A modell of an intended will, to be confirmed and executed if ever peace returne upon Israell&#146;, dated 14 April 1645  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/193). Although he had earlier claimed to have had <blockquote>all his estate both personall and reall sequestred, his bookes (in which lay his chiefest treasure) taken from him, his familie turned out of house and home, his servants and friends examined upon oath, concerning any plate, money, rents or arrerages, bills or bonds belonging to him, and all that could be found seized upon (<span class="italic">Sacra nemesis</span>, 90)</blockquote>many of his possessions may have been concealed by friends, as his will required his overseer Mr John Halloway to enter into a &pound;700 bond for the safe custody of his plate. To Gregory Braxton, &#145;for manie yeares my right eye and hand&#146;, he left &pound;100, together with &#145;all the copies begun or finished against Poperie, Arminianisme or Anabaptisticall Heresies&#146; and &#145;a booke which my Lord Craven put mee upon long agoe, perfect for the presse&#146;, requesting &#145;that in the printing thereof greate regard be had to the speedie dispersinge of the copies, for God is my Judge that my principall end and scope of writeing of them was the glorifieinge of God and the cleareinge of his most holy truth&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/193).<br>
<br>Featley was the subject of two biographical accounts, the first by William Leo, minister of Wandsworth, Surrey, and the second by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9243/', "John Featley (1604/5&#150;1667)")</script>. Leo's account was published in 1645 together with his funeral sermon for Featley; he stated that he had known Featley for thirty-seven years, &#145;one and twenty of which time we lived loving friends and neighbours but three miles distant from one another&#146;  (Leo, F1<i>r</i>, p. 25). John Featley's &#145;Succinct history of the life and death of the learned and famous divine, Daniel Featley&#146; was annexed to <span class="italic">Featlaei paligenesia, or, Doctor Daniel Featley Revived</span> (1660); it is considerably fuller than Leo's account, but inaccurate in some details. He described his uncle as &#145;affable and courteous to all, without the least commixture of that sullen morosity which some men mistake for gravity&#146;  (Featley, L3<i>r</i>, p. 81), though he noted that Featley's zeal in controversy had often made his opponents &#145;unjustly suspect that he had been cholerick&#146;  (ibid.). The fact that Featley devoted so much of his energies to polemical and controversial divinity meant that his writings were quickly forgotten; and this, together with his failure to achieve any major ecclesiastical preferment, has served to obscure his real talents as a theologian. Among protestant divines in France and the Netherlands he was regarded as one of the leading defenders of the Reformed faith; Leo recalled visiting the University of Groningen and seeing Featley's name in a list of &#145;the most famous Schoole-men&#146; of the Christian church. It was his misfortune that, having found himself out of favour in the 1630s because of his views on doctrine, Featley then found himself attacked in the 1640s because of his views on church discipline, and was thus denied the recognition his talents deserved.<br>
