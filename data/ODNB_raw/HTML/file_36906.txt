<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Norman</span>  (1882&#150;1934), <span class="occ">stage designer</span>, was born at Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, on 8 August 1882, the second son of Howard Wilkinson, of Handsworth Wood, a partner in the firm of Wilkinson and Riddell, textile wholesalers in Birmingham, and his wife, Jessie Caroline Bragg. He was educated at the New School, Abbotsholme, Derbyshire, which had Swedenborgian affiliations. Here he benefited from an enlightened policy which replaced the usual patriotic heroes of conventional teaching with the great thinkers and artists. He thus gained an early familiarity with the works of, among others, Shakespeare, Blake, and Bach, and was familiar with the writings of Edward Maitland, Anna Kingsford, and other mystics.<br>
<br>On leaving school Wilkinson entered the Birmingham School of Art, which was then at its peak under the able administration of Edward R. Taylor. The brilliant staff included Arthur Gaskin and Henry Payne, who were both at that time working with William Morris. Wilkinson was able to indulge and develop his highly individual taste and acquired possessions such as a sixteenth-century harpsichord, a Kelmscott <span class="italic">Chaucer</span>, and old Welsh furniture with which he furnished in part a house designed for the family by W. R. Lethaby. Although he already had a small room fitted up as a model theatre, on the stage of which he produced scenery for Shakespearian dramas, his bent was really that of the collector and producer. He composed charming musical settings for the early lyrics of W. B. Yeats and for old carols, and he played the harpsichord with taste. Naturally of a generous and affable disposition, Wilkinson was also shy and self-conscious, and though he possessed great and diverse talents, he lacked the intense application and ability necessary to make the most of them.<br>
<br>There followed periods spent in Paris and Italy with an especially intensive study of Gothic art and Tudor design. Wilkinson's enthusiasm for Elizabethan drama did not, however, rule out the work of Maeterlinck, Stephen Phillips, and Bernard Shaw, and he was drawn to the less commercial stage. He began designing costumes in 1910 for Charles Frohman's repertory season at the Duke of York's Theatre, and followed this up with sets for <span class="italic">A Winter's Tale</span> and <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1914) for Harley Granville Barker at the Savoy Theatre. Wilkinson's memorable design for the production of the <span class="italic">Dream</span> featured an iridescent forest and &#145;gold-faced fairies, their eyebrows picked out in crimson&#146;. William Bridges-Adams, with whom Wilkinson would later collaborate on another famous production of the play at Stratford, objected to this &#145;stylistic treatment&#146;, which he thought rendered the play too &#145;stylish, sophisticated, <i>towny</i>&#146;  (Brock and Pringle, 42). He likened Wilkinson's fairies to &#145;static little figurines on a London mantlepiece&#146; rather than the ethereal creatures of Shakespeare's imagination  (Speaight, 91). The design nevertheless put Wilkinson &#145;in the vanguard of the rebellion against nineteenth-century stage realism&#146; and won for him an international reputation as a stage designer  (Brock and Pringle, 41&#150;2). He had further success in 1914 with his settings for Granville Barker's production of <span class="italic">The Dynasts</span> at the Kingsway Theatre.<br>
<br>The First World War had a powerful impact on Wilkinson's life and work, and he never fully recovered from the effects of its brutalities upon his sensitive and essentially pacifist nature. For a time afterwards he continued his work at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, which was then under the management of Nigel Playfair, and designed sets for <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, <span class="italic">Lionel and Clarissa</span>, and <span class="italic">The Would-Be Gentleman</span> in 1925&#150;6. To this period also belong his designs for plays produced by the Phoenix Society and the Stage Society.<br>
<br>In 1932 Bridges-Adams invited Wilkinson to design the settings and costumes for his production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> at the Stratford Memorial Theatre, of which Wilkinson had become a governor in 1920. It was the last play to open in the 1932 festival spring season and it proved to be the high point, principally because of the stage design. Bridges-Adams gave Wilkinson a free hand and the &#145;glitter of gold&#146; of the pre-war Granville Barker production now &#145;mellowed to softest silver&#146;  (Brock and Pringle, 42). The players wore robes of white and dove-grey and the overall effect was one of &#145;memorable and satisfying beauty&#146;  (Kemp and Trewin, 165). The next year Wilkinson and Bridges-Adams enjoyed another successful collaboration with an acclaimed production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, in which they created an Elizabethan atmosphere on the apron stage with a setting notable for its simplicity. It ranked as one of the best productions of the play seen at Stratford.<br>
<br>Wilkinson had proved an important source of new inspiration at the festival, though his influence there was destined to be short-lived. He died, unmarried, in London on 14 February 1934. At the time of his death he was working on designs for <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> at Stratford, and Bridges-Adams paid tribute to his artistry: &#145;He was something of an Elizabethan, and his taste was catholic, embracing everything, old or new, that was first rate. Modernity held no terrors for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
