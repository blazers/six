<span class="headword">Welsby,  William Newland</span>  (1803&#150;1864), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born at Acton, near Nantwich in Cheshire, the only son of William Welsby, a barrister of the Middle Temple and land agent, and his wife, formerly Miss Newland. He received his schooling at Acton grammar school and Dr Doncaster's, Oakham, before being admitted on 28 October 1818 as a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1823 and MA in 1827. On 22 April 1823 he was admitted as student at the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar on 10 November 1826. He went the north Wales and Chester circuit, in time becoming the leader, and in 1841 was appointed recorder of Chester by Lord Cottenham, to whom his father was agent. He became junior counsel to the Treasury and was chosen to hold an inquiry into Birmingham borough prison in 1853. He enjoyed the reputation of being an accomplished scholar and lawyer, but while contemporaries acknowledged that he was just and upright, they found &#145;a certain roughness of manner and indifference to general opinion which at times caused him to be misunderstood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Times</span>, 418).<br>
<br>An industrious and prolific writer, Welsby edited, with Roger Meeson, seventeen volumes of <span class="italic">Exchequer Reports</span>, beginning with 1837, and collaborated with E. T. Hurlstone and J. Gordon in nine subsequent volumes ranging from 1849. In conjunction with John Horatio Lloyd he published in three parts <span class="italic">Reports of Mercantile Cases in the Courts of Common Law</span> in 1829 and 1830, and with Edward Beavan he edited the second edition of Chitty's <span class="italic">Collection of Statutes</span> (1851&#150;4, 4 vols.), superintending also the third edition, which appeared in 1865, after his death. He &#145;seemed to have a peculiar talent for re-arranging and improving old textbooks and adapting them to existing needs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Times</span>, 418). Among works which benefited from his attentions were <span class="italic">Archbold's Summary of the Law on Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases</span> (tenth and fifteenth editions) and Jervis's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Office of Coroner</span> (1854). Welsby also edited a volume of sixteen <span class="italic">Lives of Eminent English Judges of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries</span>, which originally came out in the <span class="italic">Law Magazine</span>; nine of them were from his pen.<br>
<br>Renowned for his capacity for hard work, Welsby eventually overtaxed his strength. On 1 July 1864 he died at his home, 19 Holland Villas Road, Kensington, London. He left a widow, Mary, but no children.<br>
