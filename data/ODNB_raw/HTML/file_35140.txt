<span class="headword">Muddiman, Sir  Alexander Phillips</span>  (1875&#150;1928), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Leighton Buzzard on 14 February 1875, the second son of Alexander Phillips Muddiman, bookseller and publisher, and his wife, Anne Griffiths. Muddiman was educated at Wimborne School and University College, London. He passed the Indian Civil Service examination in 1897 and joined the service in Bengal in 1899.<br>
<br>Muddiman's ability attracted attention, but his career did not follow a typical pattern. After three years in the districts he became an under-secretary to the Bengal government, then registrar on the appellate side in the Calcutta high court and, in 1910, deputy secretary in the legislative department of the government of India. He remained quite inconspicuous on the great issues of the day, confining himself largely to legal and technical matters; for example in 1917, amid pleas for increases in executive powers, Muddiman recommended quasi-judicial commissions to deal with those suspected of violent &#145;sedition&#146;. He played no important part in the making of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms (1915&#150;19), but was appointed to represent the government of India on Lord Southborough's committee on franchises and other rules of business, touring India and on deputation to London (1918&#150;19). Significant political issues were involved in the details, when the franchise was being extended from a few thousands to several millions of voters, but again Muddiman's role seems to have been chiefly one of drafting, for example of the regulations for the conduct of legislative business. In this narrow sense he was well qualified for his later close involvement with the reformed councils, though there was general surprise when he was appointed president of the council of state, the new central upper house. As chairman he was courteous, imperturbable, and conciliatory.<br>
<br>In March 1924 Muddiman became home member in the government of India. Unlike his notable predecessors, the inventive William Vincent or the influential but inflexible Reginald Craddock, Muddiman did not need to devise new strategies for dealing with nationalist agitation. His term coincided with a largely constitutional phase in the politics of the Indian National Congress, and was remembered chiefly for Muddiman's pledge in March 1925&#151;an early instance of positive discrimination&#151;to reserve places for Muslims in the Indian Civil Service, appointing by nomination to make up any shortfall after the competitive examination. Nor did Muddiman devote great attention to the details of administration. For him the important focus&#151;unintentionally appropriate to the emerging political order&#151;remained the legislature, where he was now the official leader of the assembly (or lower house). Again he showed calm and good humour.<br>
<br>Muddiman was the obvious person, in 1924, to head a committee appointed to report on the workings of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms, the most exposed and political task of his career. Scarcely had the new legislatures met in 1920 when the Liberal Party, though co-operating in the reforms, called for a constitutional revision to allow at least provincial autonomy. Urgency grew after the election of the Congressite Swaraj Party members in 1924. The Muddiman committee was appointed to resist a constitutional conference demanded of the new British Labour government by the Swaraj Party leader, Motilal Nehru. By this time members of the government of India also expected that full provincial self-government would be conceded, if only to preserve British power at the centre. Muddiman's job was to produce a consensus for further concessions, to forestall more radical revisions. His task was complicated by calls to reverse the 1919 reforms rather than extend them, especially after the formation of a Conservative government in Britain, and the appointment as secretary of state for India of the ignorant and prejudiced Birkenhead, who thought the reforms ill-conceived and &#145;extremely mischievous&#146; since it was inconceivable that India would ever be fit for dominion government.<br>
<br>The workings of &#145;dyarchy&#146; (division of the provincial functions of government between civil servants and ministers drawn from the legislatures) had been criticized for a lack of joint deliberations between the two wings of government, for confusions of responsibility, and for excessive financial controls, all matters related to Muddiman's drafting of the rules of business but also inherent in a divided administration. There were more general criticisms of a want of co-operation from British officials and of the lack of real authority vested in the ministers, especially collectively. Though he stuck at the task for eighteen months Muddiman did not succeed in securing a unanimous report from his committee. A minority of four (Sapru, Sivaswamy Aiyer, Jinnah, and Paranjpye) were strongly critical of the system's basic weakness and contradictions, and its operation in Bengal and the Central Provinces. A majority of five concluded that the problems were inevitable and transitional. Their denial of failure was important for resisting pressure to abandon the experiment. Admitted failures, being attributed to diarchy as well as the conditions and spirit of its operation, strengthened the arguments for a further transfer of power to Indians. Such a line was adopted in the report of the Simon commission (1930), but most significantly in practice in the extension of the reforms in 1935.<br>
<br>Muddiman was knighted in 1922 and created KCSI in 1926. At the end of 1927 he was appointed governor of the United Provinces. But he was already a sick man, and on 17 July 1928, after barely six months in office, he died at Naini Tal of heart failure.<br>
<br>As a legal draftsman Muddiman had an elegant and clear style, but he was not a profound or learned lawyer. His good nature and high spirits led him to take a larger part in the British social life of Simla and Delhi than was usual for high officials in colonial India; in particular he was a brilliant bridge player. He was unmarried.<br>
