<span class="headword">Lodge, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1509/10&#150;1585), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, the son of William Littleton, also known as Lodge, and his wife, Joan Burleton, was born at Cound in Shropshire; his father's use of the name Lodge was attributed to his living at Le Lodge, Cresset (Cressage?), in Shropshire, and to his claimed descent from Odard de Logis, Baron Wigton, of Cumberland, in the reign of Henry I. He was apprenticed in London to William Pratt, in the Grocers' Company, in 1528.<br>
<br>Lodge engaged in foreign trade in Antwerp and was an enthusiastic supporter of schemes for opening new markets in distant countries. He was a member of the Grocers' Company, and served as warden in 1548 and as master in 1554&#150;5 and again in 1559&#150;60. In 1561 he was president of St Thomas's Hospital. He played a role in the government of the city of London, being sworn in as alderman of Cheap ward in 1553 and being chosen as sheriff in 1559. He was one of those who signed a document accepting Lady Jane Grey as queen in 1553.<br>
<br>Lodge married first Madwlyn (Magdalene) Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1548), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28146/', "Stephen Vaughan")</script>, merchant. It was a brief marriage: begun about 1544, it ended with her death on 26 July 1548. In 1549 Lodge married Margaret Parker, who had &#145;well and truly served the said Sir Thomas Lodge in his house in the state of a mayden servant&#146;  (TNA: PRO, close rolls C54/463). She died on 26 April 1552, leaving him with daughters Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1549) and Susan (<i>bap</i>. 1551), both of whom survived to a marriageable age.<br>
<br>Lodge was elected lord mayor in 1562, and became the first mayor to ignore the ancient custom of being clean-shaven. It was to be an eventful year for him; on 8 March 1563 he was knighted, and in April a son was baptized. The latter was one of five sons (among them the dramatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16923/', "Thomas Lodge (1558&#150;1625)")</script>) and a daughter born of his marriage in 1552 to Anne Lane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Loddington (1528&#150;1579), the stepdaughter of Sir William Laxton, a member of the Grocers' Company and a former lord mayor. However, the same year he had to contend with the effects of an outbreak of plague, and he also fell foul of Edward Skeggs, purveyor to the queen, who seized twelve capons provided for the lord mayor's table. Lodge compelled him to return six and threatened to lock him up in Newgate, which led both men to much public posturing and complaints to their patrons. Lodge was chastised and fined, but, because of the plague, not punished further.<br>
<br>The founding charter of the Merchants of Russia (the Russia Company) of 1555 names Lodge as among the first assistants to the governors, and by 1561 he was himself a governor. The Russia Company's interests were not limited to that region, and many members were keen to open trade with the Guinea coast of west Africa. Their first venture was in 1562; underwritten by Lodge, with Sir Lionell Duckett and others, three good ships sailed in October to Guinea to buy black Africans for shipment to the West Indies. 300 were sold there, and goods bought for sale in England when the ships landed in September 1563. This voyage is supposed to have inaugurated England's involvement in slave trading.<br>
<br>According to the antiquary Arthur Agarde (1540&#150;1615), Lodge was responsible for bringing German metal-workers to England to refine the base coins which Queen Elizabeth had sent to the Tower. Lodge told Agarde that when these men fell sick (probably from inhaling the fumes of arsenic given off by the base metal) they found relief by drinking from human skulls, which Lodge obtained from those exhibited on London Bridge, under a warrant granted by the council.<br>
<br>Lodge seems to have been embroiled in later disputes; he was obliged to resign as alderman in 1566, and in 1576 was committed to Newgate for striking alderman John Braunche in the face. He suffered financial loss when one of his ships was seized by the French in a trade war, but the queen and the city tried later to help him. He died in February 1585 and was buried, with his first wife and her father, in St Mary Aldermary, in the vault of Henry Keble, &#145;whose bones were unkindly cast out, and his monument pulled down, in place whereof monuments are set up of the later buried&#146;  (Stow, 1.253). In his will, proved by his son-in-law Gamaliel Woodford, he describes himself as of West Ham, to whose poor he left &pound;5, and he also possessed the manor of Malmeynes at Barking, Essex. He provided for a funeral sermon to be preached in the churches of St Peter, Cornhill, and St Mary Aldermary.<br>
