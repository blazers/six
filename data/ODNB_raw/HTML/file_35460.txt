<span class="headword">P&eacute;lissier,  Harry Gabriel</span>  (1874&#150;1913), <span class="occ">comedian, composer, and producer</span>, was born at Elm House, Church End, Finchley, Middlesex, on 27 April 1874, the second son of Frederic Antoine P&eacute;lissier (<i>d</i>. 1914), a French diamond merchant, and his wife, Jennie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kean. In 1894, after an unhappy six months in the family business in Berwick Street, Soho, London, he joined a small entertainment party run by the Baddeley brothers. They performed at charities and similar events around south London and were turned into a professional troupe by Sherrington Chinn. P&eacute;lissier bought him out and the renamed Follies opened as a pierrot show on Worthing pier on 7 August 1896.<br>
<br>While weak burlesques of Shakespeare and other serious dramas had been done before, P&eacute;lissier and his troupe broke new ground. Under his direction the Follies parodied not only the plots but the music of grand opera, musical comedy, the current rage for patriotic and sentimental songs, and every topic of the moment. Aspirants for a music-hall engagement were satirized in &#145;The Voice Trial&#146;, Germany's rearming produced the song &#145;Yes, I Don't Think&#146;, and Lloyd George's election promises were mocked in &#145;Back to the Land&#146;. P&eacute;lissier's pastiches of patriotic songs and ballads were so accurate that it is difficult for modern readers to distinguish them from the originals. Making full use of his musical inventiveness, topicality, wit, and a carefully chosen cast of artistes, the Follies became known up and down the country and achieved success in London with a brilliant satire of the pantomime <span class="italic">Bill Bailey</span> at the Palace Theatre in 1904.<br>
<br>The following year P&eacute;lissier's reputation was confirmed with a command performance at Sandringham, especially when it became known that Edward VII had particularly enjoyed his brilliant parodies of Wagner's operas. In March 1907 he took the bold step of taking the Royalty Theatre in London for a season, filling each evening with his own burlesques. The experiment proved a success and in 1908 he took the Apollo, where the Follies appeared for the next four years.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1911 P&eacute;lissier married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30957/', "Fay Compton (1894&#150;1978)")</script>, a member of his troupe, daughter of the theatrical manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45887/', "Edward Compton")</script>, and sister of the author Compton Mackenzie, and the same year it became clear that he was ill. Seeking ever more extravagant stage effects, his last three Follies seasons were unsuccessful; he died at his father-in-law's home, 1 Nevern Square, Earls Court, London, on 25 September 1913 from cirrhosis of the liver, leaving an infant son. After cremation at Golders Green his ashes were placed in his mother's grave at Marylebone cemetery, on 29 September.<br>
<br>Generous and open-handed, P&eacute;lissier was a huge roly-poly of a man with a highly developed sense of the ridiculous. Although he gave an impression of utter irresponsibility he had an amazing capacity for work. When an injunction stopped his parody of <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span>, then London's most popular musical comedy, P&eacute;lissier produced new music and words for <span class="italic">The Deceased Wife's Sister</span> in two hours in a style different enough to avoid legal problems but sufficiently similar to enrage the complainant and delight the public. Some of his sketches, published in 1913 as <span class="italic">Potted P&eacute;lissier</span>, give an indication of the wit and observation that made him the leading satirist of his time.<br>
