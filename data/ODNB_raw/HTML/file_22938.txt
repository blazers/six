<span class="headword">Quain, Sir  John Richard</span>  (1816&#150;1876), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Ratheahy, co. Cork, the youngest son of Richard Quain of Ratheahy and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Andrew Mahoney. Two half-brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22939/', "Jones Quain")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22940/', "Richard Quain")</script>, became prominent figures in the medical profession. Quain was educated at G&ouml;ttingen, and at University College, London, where he won many prizes, graduated LLB in 1839, and was elected to the university law scholarship. He became a fellow of University College in 1843, was for several years an examiner in law to the University of London, and in June 1860 became a member of the senate. Admitted to the Middle Temple on 18 November 1837, he was in the chambers of Thomas Chitty and practised as a special pleader from 1841 until his call on 30 May 1851. He then joined the northern circuit, wrote a book on the <span class="roman">Common Law Procedure Acts</span> with Holroyd (1853), and soon obtained a considerable practice. On 23 July 1866 he became a queen's counsel, and later the same year, a bencher of the Middle Temple. In 1868 he was made attorney-general for the county palatine of Durham and he also served on the judicature commission.<br>
<br>Quain was appointed a judge of the queen's bench in December 1871, took his seat and was made a serjeant on 5 January 1872, and was knighted on 22 April. Adolphus Liddell, author and fellow lawyer, described him as: &#145;An odd man, outwardly and inwardly. He was short and round, with a large forehead, protruding eyes, and no chin&#146;  (Liddell, 130). Rather mercurial in temperament, he was touchy and sensitive of his dignity. Before he could make much of an impression as a judge, his health failed and, after some months of intermittent illness, he died at his house, 22A Cavendish Square, on 12 September 1876, and was buried at Marylebone cemetery, Finchley, on 18 September. He was unmarried. His interest in legal education was attested by a substantial bequest for that purpose and his law library was presented to University College, London, by his half-brother, Professor Richard Quain MD.<br>
