<span class="headword">Davies,  Henry</span>  (1782&#150;1862), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in London. His father was of Welsh descent; after leaving the navy, where he had been a surgeon, he set up practice in St Martin's Lane, London. Henry was apprenticed to Mr Hammond, a surgeon at Malling, Kent, and after attending lectures by George Pearson, Joseph Carpuc, and Joshua Brodres, he was admitted a member of the College of Surgeons in 1803. Davies became a surgeon in the army, and after serving for several years, in various parts of Europe and America, he resigned his commission and took a house in London in 1817. He made visits to Paris, Dublin, and Edinburgh, where he attended the hospitals and medical schools, before obtaining his MD from the University of Aberdeen in 1823 and becoming a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1823. He gave up all practice but midwifery, became physician to the British Lying-in Hospital, and was also for some years lecturer on midwifery and the diseases of women and children in the medical school of St George's Hospital. Davies was described as &#145;a man of kindly disposition, and great shrewdness and tact at the bedside&#146;  (Munk, 280). He edited a tenth edition of Michael Underwood's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Diseases of Children</span> in 1846. His additions are marked by his initials, but his contemporaries considered that he had spoiled the original work by numerous interpolations from other authors. He also published <span class="italic">The Young Wife's Guide</span> (1844). Deafness made it increasingly difficult for Davies to practise and in 1851 he was forced to retire to the country, but returned to London after a year, and died there following an attack of &#145;fever&#146; on 9 January 1862 at his home, 6 Duchess Street, Portland Place. He was survived by at least one son and two daughters.<br>
