<span class="headword">Clarke,  (Charles) Allen</span>  (1863&#150;1935), <span class="occ">journalist and dialect writer</span>, was born at 58 Parrot Street, Bolton, Lancashire, on 26 February 1863, the eldest of nine children of Joseph Clarke, a cotton mule spinner, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marsh, also a factory worker. The journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32433/', "Thomas Clarke (1884&#150;1957)")</script> was his youngest brother.<br>
<br>Clarke's early upbringing exerted a lasting influence on his public career. He was born into the cotton famine of the early 1860s, and with his father in only occasional work, his mother had been obliged to continue working until shortly before his birth. She returned to the mill soon afterwards, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandmother. In his later writings, Clarke showed a particular sympathy for the women and children of the factory districts. His father's radical and republican allegiances coloured an intellectual training that, in formal terms at least, was wholly conventional, commencing with attendance at a local dame-school from the age of four, followed by elementary schools. In addition to Shakespeare and Byron, Joseph Clarke's library included works by Burns, Chartist pamphlets, and the dialect writings of the Bolton journalist James Taylor Staton. Allen Clarke's later socialism drew heavily on earlier radical models, while his principal comic creation, Bill Spriggs, owed much&#151;including his location in the Bolton district of Tonge Fold (&#145;Tum Fowt&#146;)&#151;to Staton's Billy Bobbin.<br>
<br>Initially at least, Clarke's career followed the pattern mapped out by most of his contemporaries. A succession of half-time jobs, including a brief period at Mirfield in Yorkshire, culminated in his entry into factory work at Crosses' cotton mill at Gilnow, Bolton. His time at the mule gate was brief. Within months, prompted by the suggestion of his former headmaster, his parents allowed him to take up the post of pupil-teacher. He became disenchanted with grooming children for half-time work, and increasingly saw writing as his true vocation, a belief confirmed by the reception accorded pieces he submitted to local and national newspapers. After a brief period of unemployment, he was taken on by the local newspaper publishers, Tillotsons. His work for them included the transcribing of parish registers, which encouraged a keen interest in the history and topography of the Bolton area. The regular income also enabled Clarke to marry, on 1 June 1887, Lavinia (1859/1860&#150;1889), daughter of Thomas Pilling, a pork butcher, of Bolton.<br>
<br>At the same time, Clarke joined the local branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), established to exploit, through the presence as organizer of Tom Mann, the militancy unleashed by the lock-out in Bolton's engineering trade in 1887. Having broken with Tillotsons in a dispute over pay, Clarke sought to galvanize further this first wave of socialist enthusiasm by producing his own paper. <span class="italic">Labour Light</span>, first published in March 1890, was also designated the &#145;official voice of the Shop Assistants' Union&#146; and reflected Clarke's enthusiasm for extending collective organization among the unskilled, a project which also led him to work with J. R. Clynes and fellow writer James Haslam to promote a union for the young assistants of adult mule spinners, the piecers. The failure of the piecers' union in the face of opposition from the spinners, combined with poor sales of <span class="italic">Labour Light</span>, heralded Clarke's retreat from conventional industrial politics. In later works, Clarke denounced the &#145;collective selfishness&#146; of trade unions  (C. A. Clarke, <span class="italic">The Effects of the Factory System</span>, 1899; repr. 1988, 147). Finding that readers had turned to <span class="italic">Labour Light</span> not for the illumination it offered on current industrial controversies, but for the comic dialect sketches included at the suggestion of the paper's printer, he also became convinced that workers preferred amusement to enlightenment in their literature. Amusement was the declared intent behind the <span class="italic">Bolton Trotter</span>, launched in January 1891. Its popularity boosted by the regular inclusion of &#145;Tum Fowt&#146; sketches, the <span class="italic">Trotter</span> claimed, at its peak, a readership of some 20,000. By September 1893, however, declining sales and financial difficulty had forced the paper's closure. Clarke now sought work with the cotton union's own publication, the <span class="italic">Cotton Factory Times</span>.<br>
<br>Two years later, Clarke produced his most extended commentary on contemporary social problems. Serialized in <span class="italic">The Clarion</span> before appearing in book form in 1899, <span class="italic">The Effects of the Factory System</span> depicted a workforce entirely lacking in radical potential, seeking escape from the dulling monotony of modern forms of work through the pursuit of short-term sensory and material gratification. As an alternative to lives which amounted to little more than &#145;aw bed, aw work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bolton and District ILP Pioneer</span>, June 1895), the book advanced an Owenite vision of small-scale, self-sufficient rural communities, uniting all classes in a common productive endeavour. Informing this was a socialism that eschewed models of conflict in favour of an idea of evolutionary progress towards a co-operative future and which drew less on the tenets of Marxian political economy than the poetry of Walt Whitman.<br>
<br>Such ideas were propounded in much of Clarke's fiction, in particular a series of novels and short stories which addressed the problems of contemporary industrial life. In many the standard of reform was raised not by workers themselves, but by figures from outside the working class. Many appeared in Clarke's most enduring periodical publication, <span class="italic">Teddy Ashton's Journal</span>. Produced between 1896 and 1908, and appearing under a variety of titles, this weekly publication became the principal outlet for Clarke's vision of moral and spiritual enlightenment to be attained through a lifestyle embracing rambling, cycling, temperance, and vegetarianism. An opportunity to promote such ideas came with the invitation to stand as the joint Independent Labour Party/SDF parliamentary candidate in Rochdale at the general election of 1900. Clarke's claim to speak for the working man in part through the dialect language of his <i>alter ego</i> Teddy Ashton attracted few converts; he came bottom of the poll with a modest 8 per cent of the vote. The campaign marked the beginning and the end of Clarke's parliamentary ambitions.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Clarke's drive to reconnect the toiling masses with the natural world around them had attracted the attention of Tolstoy, who was sufficiently impressed with <span class="italic">The Effects of the Factory System</span> to recommend its translation into Russian. In 1904 Clarke wrote to Tolstoy outlining plans for a self-supporting rural colony-cum-holiday resort, to be located close to the Lancashire coast. Named after the daisy for the flower's association with fields and fresh air, the colony was inspired by an article in Clarke's <span class="italic">Northern Weekly</span> and attracted support from across the industrial north of England. However, Bispham, the chosen site just north of Blackpool, proved unfavourable ground for ideas of rural regeneration. Divisions among those running the colony meant that the site was quickly abandoned, leaving Clarke for neither the first nor the last time in his life with the task of managing outstanding debts. The colony's failure represented the latest in a series of setbacks affecting circulation of the <span class="italic">Northern Weekly</span>, which had sold an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 copies a week at its peak. Falling advertising revenue forced its closure in 1908. From that point, although Clarke's most consistent source of journalistic income was provided by work for the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span>, the name Teddy Ashton and Clarke's brand of dialect humour would live on in the series of annuals published regularly from 1890.<br>
<br>By the time that the <span class="italic">Northern Weekly</span> ceased publication, Clarke and his family had settled for the second and final time in Blackpool, bustling centre of the largely rural Fylde district of Lancashire. Here, free of the &#145;blighted and dreary&#146; life of the factory towns  (Clarke, <span class="italic">Effects</span>, 23), he could develop that closer communion with nature deemed essential for the moral and spiritual reclamation of the individual and of society more generally. Such ideas, given practical shape in the promotion of cycling and rambling organizations, were also articulated in writings brought together in two volumes celebrating the beauties of &#145;Windmill Land&#146;.<br>
<br>In this later phase of Clarke's career, spiritual themes, which had first emerged following the death of his first wife a matter of months after their marriage, assumed increasing prominence in his output. A conviction that the living were capable of communing with the dead had been fostered when the woman who was to be Clarke's second wife, Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1927), the daughter of John Taylor, a weaving overlooker from Chorley, claimed during their courtship to have had contact with the late Lavinia. In subsequent years, the deaths of three of the Clarkes' children confirmed Clarke in the conviction that death constituted the continuation of life &#145;in other spheres&#146;  (Salveson, <span class="italic">Teddy Ashton's Lancashire Scrapbook</span>, 53). The most extended statement of these spiritualist beliefs came in <span class="italic">The Eternal Question: Shall We Live Again?</span>, first published in 1902, but which appeared in a new edition in 1919, with a foreword by Conan Doyle.<br>
<br>Despite his growing preoccupation with the spirit world, Clarke never broke completely with labour politics. Shortly before his death, the fissile tendencies so apparent in the world of early socialism re-emerged in the unlikely setting of Blackpool Rambling Club. Following criticism of a fellow official, Clarke left to form the Blackpool Speedwell Fellowship Ramblers, taking part of their name from the blue flower which adorned the lanes and hedgerows of Windmill Land. After attending a meeting of the fellowship Clarke died suddenly, of angina, at his home, 17 St Ives Avenue, Blackpool, on 12 December 1935. He was buried in Marton cemetery, Blackpool. Three sons and a daughter survived him. Dogged by financial difficulties to the end, he had received help from his former employer, Tillotsons, in 1930.<br>
<br>Attempts by the Lancashire Authors' Association to provide a permanent memorial to Clarke at Marton Mill on the Fylde were frustrated by financial constraints and the exigencies of war. In the absence of a physical monument, his memory endured through his writings. Although neither particularly profound nor original, by their very breadth they touched on many aspects of life in the industrial north at a time when its political, economic, and cultural weight was at its height. The few works to have been reprinted since Clarke's death reflect his importance as a poet of Lancashire's moorland and coastal plain, and as a lively critic of contemporary industrial civilization. He also has a secure place in the tradition of northern humour, celebrating the wit and wisdom of common folk. In 1935, shortly before Clarke's death, sketches featuring his most enduring creation, Bill Spriggs, conceived in the late nineteenth-century efflorescence of popular dialect writing, were broadcast on the Northern Programme of the BBC. By spanning print and broadcast media, Clarke played a full part in sustaining a vital and still vibrant regional culture.<br>
