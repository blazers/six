<span class="headword">Graham family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1250&#150;1513), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was descended from Anglo-Norman immigrants who came to Scotland under William the Lion and increased in importance from the twelfth century, particularly through the patronage of the Comyns, securing the lordships of Dalkeith and Eskdale in Edinburghshire. David Graham, a member of a junior branch of the family, served Patrick, fifth earl of Dunbar, and was deputy justiciar of Lothian in 1248. A notable accumulator of estates, in 1253 he obtained royal confirmation for eighteen grants of land, including Eliston and Kinpunt in the west of Lothian, Dundaff and Strathcarron in Stirlingshire, and lands in Cunningham and Carrick. Substantial grants from the earl of Lennox were to form the basis of the Graham barony of Mugdock, and grants of land in Perthshire by Malise, earl of Strathearn, were to form the barony of Kincardine. Graham supported the Comyns in 1255, and shared their political eclipse, but was back in favour as sheriff of Berwick by 1264. He died <i>c</i>.1272 and was succeeded by his son, Patrick, who consolidated his father's estates in Lennox and Strathearn and took an active part in national politics following the death of Alexander III. Sheriff of Stirling by 1289, he served as one of the Scottish auditors in 1291, and was a steadfast supporter of John Balliol until he met his death at Dunbar in 1296. He married Annabella, sister of Malise, earl of Strathearn (<i>d</i>. 1293).<br>
<br>Patrick Graham's son, David, who had fought with his father at Dunbar and was taken prisoner after the battle, succeeded. He continued to uphold the Balliol cause, and it was the killing of his patron, Sir John Comyn, by Robert Bruce, that explains his reluctance to espouse Bruce's cause and led to a period of English service. Following Bannockburn, however, Graham accepted the political situation and returned to serve Robert I, appending his seal to the declaration of Arbroath in 1320. In 1325 he exchanged lands in the earldom of Carrick with the king, for which he received lands including Old Montrose in the sheriffdom of Forfar. He died <i>c</i>.1330, and was succeeded by his son, also David, who was one of those who submitted to Edward Balliol after the battle of Dupplin and Balliol's coronation at Scone in 1332. But Graham made his peace with David II, and in 1346 accompanied the king into England and was taken prisoner with him at Nevilles Cross on 17 October, but he had returned to Scotland by 1348, and was later appointed as one of the commissioners to negotiate David II's release. His continuing career in royal service is demonstrated by his frequent appearances as a witness in official records until his death <i>c</i>.1376. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Patrick Graham, who in 1357 had been a hostage for the ransom of David II. Active as a diplomat in negotiations with England, and in financial administration, Graham was a staunch supporter of Robert Stewart, earl of Fife and later duke of Albany, from whom he received lands in the Lennox. It was on Albany's behalf that in 1399 Graham was appointed to the council established to advise, and restrain, the duke of Rothesay, the king's lieutenant. But he died in 1400, and was succeeded by his son William, born of his first marriage, to a woman named Matilda. His second wife, Euphemia Stewart, was the daughter of a half-brother of Robert II.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54212"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Graham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1424)<span class="occ"></span> formed links with the Douglases. He received a grant of lands in Stirlingshire from Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas, while, following the forfeiture of George Dunbar, earl of March, in 1400, Douglas influence may have led to Graham's holding March's barony of Dundaff, as tenant-in-chief of the crown. He took part in the earl of Douglas's invasion of England in September 1402, and was captured at Homildon Hill, but ransomed soon after. He was also the principal vassal of Duncan, earl of Lennox, whereby he augmented Graham estates in the Lennox, acquiring the superiority of Mugdock, his chief residence and centre of administration, which he was to hold directly of the crown. This considerable landed influence, coupled with his support for Earl Duncan's grandson, the duke of Albany, earned him substantial patronage, above all his prestigious marriage to Mary Stewart, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "Robert III")</script>. This was a palpable demonstration of Graham's high favour, notwithstanding the fact that he was Mary's third husband. Sir William's brother, <a name="cosubject_54213"></a><span class="headword">Patrick Graham</span>, second earl of Strathearn  (<em>d.</em> 1413)<span class="occ"></span>, also benefited from Albany patronage, through his marriage about 1406 to Euphemia Stewart, Albany's niece and the heir of David, earl of Strathearn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1389). As a result Patrick himself became earl of Strathearn, but on 10 August 1413 he was murdered near Crieff by John Drummond of Concraig, a close associate of Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl, who had ambitions to control Strathearn. He was succeeded as earl of Strathearn by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54217/', "Malise Graham")</script>.<br>
<br>From 1407 Sir William Graham appears on official documents as William, lord of Graham, a style which underlines his political status, as there was no territorial lordship of Graham. After Albany's death in 1420 he switched his support to Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl. Atholl had built up considerable support in Lennox, and it was on Graham's lands of Mugdock and Killearn that the Lennox men assembled in August 1423, to press their grievances just before the general council which resolved to negotiate the release of James I from English captivity. Not surprisingly, concern about the Albany Stewarts and their adherents exercised James I on his return to Scotland in 1424, Graham possession of the earldom of Strathearn being one bone of contention. Malise Graham was sent to England as a hostage for the payment of the king's ransom, fated to be the longest-serving hostage, not returning to Scotland until 1454, and James reclaimed the earldom of Strathearn for the crown, substituting for it the less valuable earldom of Menteith. Late in 1424 James I felt secure enough to move against the Albany Stewart faction. William Graham was arrested and held in Dunbar Castle, in the custody of George, earl of March, but he was dead by November 1424, having been predeceased by his son Alexander. His death dealt a severe blow to the men of Lennox, as William's younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11218/', "Sir Robert Graham")</script>, lacked the older man's experience, connections, and influence, notwithstanding the major role he was to play in the murder of James I in 1437.<br>
<br>Sir William Graham was succeeded by his grandson, <a name="cosubject_54214"></a><span class="headword">Patrick Graham</span>, first Lord Graham  (<em>d.</em> 1466)<span class="occ"></span>, who served as a hostage for James I's ransom from 1427 until 1432. His absence in England, and the lack of any noteworthy record of activity during the reign of James I, suggest a waning in the fortunes of the Grahams, but Patrick Graham's position recovered during the minority of James II, through the patronage of the Black Douglases, who exercised a considerable degree of control over the minority administration. The title lord of Graham, used by his grandfather William (except during the personal rule of James I), had been adopted by him by 1443; again, this was a designation of convenience rather than an officially conferred title; but in 1445 Graham was recognized as a lord of parliament, as Patrick, first Lord Graham. His status had been affected by James I's repossession of the earldom of Strathearn, in that his lands of Kincardine became a crown fief; now he took advantage of Douglas favour during the royal minority to obtain a new charter of infeftment which erected Kincardine into a barony. He pursued a career of royal service, appearing as one of the most frequent royal charter witnesses during the reign of James II, particularly after the Black Douglas crisis, when he was almost continuously at court, possibly to demonstrate his loyalty in spite of previous Douglas connections. In 1458 he had his lands in the Lennox erected into the barony of Mugdock. Several times an ambassador to England, he also held the keepership of Dumbarton Castle, and was sheriff of Perth in 1462 and 1464. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by his son, born of his marriage to Christian, daughter of Sir Robert Erskine.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54215"></a><span class="headword">William Graham</span>, second Lord Graham  (<em>d.</em> 1471)<span class="occ"></span>, is recorded as sitting in parliament on 9 October 1466. On 23 November following he received a safe conduct from Edward IV to accompany his relative, Patrick Graham, bishop of St Andrews, on his journey through England to France and Flanders, although there is no evidence that he used it. He sat in parliament again in 1467 and 1469, but died in 1471. He had married Helen Douglas, daughter of William Douglas, earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1437), and was succeeded by their son. <a name="cosubject_54216"></a><span class="headword">William Graham</span>, first earl of Montrose  (1462/3&#150;1513)<span class="occ"></span>, was a minor at the time of his father's death, his ward and marriage being granted by James III to Thomas, Lord Erskine. As third Lord Graham, William sat in parliament between 1479 and 1487, and he was a steadfast supporter of the king, appearing with him in Edinburgh at the end of May 1488, possibly going on to Sauchieburn with him in June. A pragmatic switch of allegiance saw Graham sitting in James IV's first parliament, on 6 October 1488, and he subsequently received grants of the lands of Aberuthven and Inchbrakie in Perthshire. On the occasion of James IV's marriage to Margaret Tudor in 1503, an earldom was created for Graham out of the Lindsay dukedom of Montrose, which had lapsed to the crown on the death of David Lindsay, and possibly in recognition of his hereditary charter for the lands of Old Montrose. This rewarded Graham for his loyalty and sought to counter the influence of the Lindsays, whose bitter feuding had destabilized Angus. Montrose was killed at Flodden in 1513, having married, first, Annabel Drummond, second, Janet, daughter of Sir Archibald Edmonston of Duntreath, and, third, Christian, widow of Patrick, Lord Haliburton. The subsequent earls of Montrose were the descendants of the first earl's first marriage.<br>
