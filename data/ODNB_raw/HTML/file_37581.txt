<span class="headword">Bury St Edmunds,  Hugo  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1130&#150;<em>c.</em>1150), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was active at the abbey of Bury St Edmunds under abbots Anselm (1121&#150;48) and Ording (1148&#150;56). Documents written at the abbey record that he worked in several media. He cast a bell for the newly rebuilt abbey church. He &#145;painted incomparably&#146; a large <span class="roman">Bible</span>, for which he obtained vellum from Ireland. He &#145;carved incomparably&#146; a cross and figures of the Virgin and St John. For the west front of the church he made a pair of decorated bronze doors, of which it was judged that &#145;as he surpassed all others in other works, in this work he wonderfully surpassed himself&#146;  (Arnold, 2.289&#150;90). Some other works may be his. A lead seal of <i>c</i>.1150, which portrays an unnamed abbot of Bury, shows the hallmarks of his style. A wall painting of <i>c</i>.1160 in the chapel of St Anselm at Canterbury Cathedral, which shows St Paul bitten by a viper on the island of Malta, has been attributed to Hugo, although it may be the work of a follower.<br>
<br>Hugo's career at Bury probably lasted from the late 1120s until the 1150s. Talbot, the prior, and Hervey, the sacrist, who commissioned Hugo to illuminate the large <span class="roman">Bible</span>, held office between <i>c</i>.1125 and <i>c</i>.1136. Elias, sacrist during most of Ording's abbacy, commissioned the cross, the latest of Hugo's recorded works. The title of &#145;master&#146;, repeatedly applied to Hugo in the Bury <span class="italic">Gesta sacristarum</span>, implies that he was probably not a monk, but a secular artist hired by the abbey.<br>
<br>Hugo's cross may be identifiable as the walrus-ivory cross at the Cloisters in New York. The first part of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> which Hugo illuminated is preserved as MS 2, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. This despoiled manuscript, containing the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> up to the book of <span class="roman">Job</span>, still preserves six large-scale pictures of biblical scenes, a decorative page of script, and forty-one decorated initials. A fragment of one leaf is all that is known to survive of the second part of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Hugo's figure style in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> derives from the art of the Alexis Master, who may have worked at Bury during his career. Hugo's use of double frames and panelled backgrounds also recalls that master's pictures, but Hugo's palette is richer, and his figures have greater weight and grace. His &#145;damp fold&#146; technique for rendering draperies derives from Byzantine art, while the curvilinear patterns of his folds show an unprecedented degree of stylization. The style which he created strongly influenced English art for the remainder of the twelfth century, and found echoes on the continent.<br>
<br>Whether or not Hugo was a wall painter, the records of his activities as carver and manuscript painter attest his versatility. His surviving work in the Bury <span class="roman">Bible</span> shows that he was worthy of the admiration which the written sources accord him.<br>
