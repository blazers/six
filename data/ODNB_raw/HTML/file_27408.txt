<span class="headword">Thurlow,  Thomas</span>  (1737&#150;1791), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was born at Ashfield, Suffolk, the second son of Thomas Thurlow (<i>bap</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. 1762), rector of Little Ashfield, and his wife, Elizabeth Smith (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1736). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27406/', "Edward Thurlow, first Baron Thurlow")</script>, was his elder brother. Thomas matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 13 July 1754, and was a demy of Magdalen College from 1755 to 1759, when he was elected a fellow. He graduated BA on 11 April 1758, and proceeded MA on 9 March 1761, BD on 13 April 1769, and DD on 23 June 1772. In 1771 he became rector of Stanhope in Durham, and in the following year was appointed master of the Temple, a post held until 1787. On 2 November 1775 he was nominated dean of Rochester, and on 30 March 1779 he was consecrated bishop of Lincoln. On 13 March 1782 he became dean of St Paul's, but he resigned the office in 1787 on being translated to the see of Durham. He died in Portland Place, London, on 27 May 1791, and was buried in the Temple Church. He and his wife, Anne, daughter of William Bere of Lymington, Hampshire, who died in August the same year, left three daughters and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27407/', "Edward Hovell-Thurlow (1781&#150;1829)")</script>, who in 1806 succeeded his uncle as second Baron Thurlow, and Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1788).<br>
<br>In 1780 Thurlow was in London during the Gordon riots and was among those attacked. He was rescued in a fainting state by a young law student who obtained refuge in a neighbouring house, from which he escaped over the roof wearing women's clothes. Thomas published a few sermons, but like many of his contemporaries was an indifferent preacher, although his elocution was excellent. He owed his advancement in the church to the advocacy of his brother, who overshadowed him, rather than to his own ability. He had business acumen in matters such as tithe, but diocesan affairs were left mostly in the hands of officials, of whom his second son, Thomas, became one in the Durham court of chancery. His income from the Durham palatinate and bishopric estates was considerable. He was, however, said to be a zealous patron of literary merit but there is no firm evidence of this. He was a persistent seeker of recipients for benefactions in his Lincoln diocese. Although retiring in manner in public, he was well liked in his private encounters and was a devoted and affectionate husband. No original portrait of him has been traced, and none exists either at the Temple or in the gallery of Durham bishops at Auckland Castle; but an anonymous engraving was done when he was bishop of Lincoln.<br>
