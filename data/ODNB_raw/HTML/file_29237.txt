<span class="headword">White,  Anthony</span>  (1781&#150;1849), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 16 December 1781 at Norton in co. Durham, the son of Robert and Isabella White. He was educated near Bishop Auckland, at Witton-le-Wear grammar school, and from 1799 at Cambridge, where he graduated MB from Emmanuel College in 1804. He was also the pupil in London of the able and eccentric surgeon Sir Anthony Carlisle, and he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 2 September 1803.<br>
<br>White now settled in London, where at the Westminster Hospital he was elected assistant surgeon on 24 July 1806, and surgeon on 24 April 1823. He also possessed a very extensive private practice. He was active as a surgeon for twenty-three years until, his hands being so affected by repeated attacks of gout that he could no longer operate, in 1846 he resigned; the governors of the hospital immediately appointed him consulting surgeon. At the Royal College of Surgeons White was elected a member of the council on 6 September 1827, and two years later, on 10 September 1829, he became a member of the court of examiners in succession to William Wadd. In 1831 he delivered the Hunterian oration, and he was vice-president of the college in 1832 and 1840, and served as president in 1834 and 1842. A great lover of the arts, particularly painting and music, he also filled the office of surgeon to the Royal Society of Musicians.<br>
<br>As a surgeon White was celebrated for his dexterity and success. Among his most remarkable work was the first operation to excise the head of the femur for disease of the hip joint, an operation then considered to be so dangerous that Sir Anthony Carlisle and Sir William Blizard not only tried to dissuade him but threatened to report him to the Royal College of Surgeons. White performed the operation with complete success, and sent the patient to call upon his opponents. White's besetting sins were indolence and unpunctuality, and he often completely forgot his appointments. White &#145;is said to have been the laziest man in his profession. He was habitually unpunctual, yet he was so good a surgeon that he soon obtained a large and lucrative practice&#146;  (Plarr, 512). As a result he published little and made few notes or records of his practice. His only publications were a <span class="italic">Treatise on the Plague</span> (1846) and an inquiry entitled <span class="italic">Proximate Cause of Gout, and its Rational Treatment</span> (1848).<br>
<br>White himself suffered severely from gout in his later years, and he died in London at his house at 5 Parliament Street on 9 March 1849.<br>
