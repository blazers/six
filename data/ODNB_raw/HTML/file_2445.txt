<span class="headword">Bird,  Golding</span>  (1814&#150;1854), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Downham, Norfolk, on 9 December 1814, the eldest of three sons and two daughters born to Golding Bird, a former official in the Inland Revenue who had worked for many years in Ireland, where he had married Marianne. As a child, Bird had suffered an attack of rheumatic fever and endocarditis which left him with a stooping posture and a limp. Bird and his younger brother Frederic, who followed him into the medical profession, received their early education from a clergyman at Wallingford, Berkshire. By the time they moved to a school in London, Bird was well versed in the classics and had acquired a taste for chemistry and botany, which he demonstrated by tutoring his classmates, a practice which was frowned on by his teachers. In December 1829 Bird's father apprenticed him to William Pretty, apothecary, of Burton Crescent, London, where he remained to the end of his term in 1833, meanwhile in 1832 entering himself as a student at Guy's Hospital. Bird was always an eager participant in societies and at Guy's he joined the Pupil's Physical Society where his first publication dealt with the analysis of urine. His industry and chemical knowledge caught the attention of his teachers, especially Thomas Addison and Sir Astley Cooper; the latter invited Bird to write a section on breast milk for his book on diseases of the breast. He then submitted a dissertation on pathological chemistry applied to the diagnosis of disease, which admitted him to fellowship of the Senior Physical Society. He was an outstanding student, gaining prizes for medicine, obstetrics, and ophthalmic surgery. The Society of Apothecaries awarded him a botany prize and on 21 January 1836 awarded him a licence without examination.<br>
<br>Bird set up in general practice at 44 Seymour Street, Euston Square, but, possibly because of his youth, attracted few patients. He therefore took the MD at St Andrews, where residence was not required, on 24 April 1838, followed two years later by the MA. He became licentiate of the College of Physicians of London on 30 September 1840 and was elected a fellow on 9 July 1845. By 1841 he was in practice as a physician, holding appointments as physician to the Finsbury Dispensary, lecturing at the Aldersgate school of medicine, and living in the family home at Wilmington Square, Clerkenwell. He moved to a larger house at 19 Myddleton Square in preparation for his marriage on 3 March 1842 to Mary Ann Brett, sister of his friend R. Hargrave Brett. They raised a family of two daughters and three sons, moving to a larger house in Russell Square in 1850.<br>
<br>From 1836 Bird had been lecturer on natural philosophy at Guy's and in this capacity he delivered the lectures which formed the basis of his <span class="italic">Elements of Natural Philosophy</span> (1838). This popular book was acclaimed for its clear and direct style but criticized for its lack of mathematical rigour. Bird saw it through three editions; the fourth and fifth were improved by Charles Brooke, who rewrote the sixth edition in 1867. From his study of the large collection of urinary calculi at Guy's, Bird wrote <span class="italic">Urinary Deposits, their Diagnosis, Pathology and Therapeutical Indications</span> (1844). It ran through five editions, the last edited by L. Birkett in 1857. About 1843 he was put in charge of the children's ward, leading to a series of reports on children's diseases.<br>
<br>Bird also lectured on the contributions of electricity to medical treatment, using and devising a range of apparatus. Treatments generally employed either static electricity, derived from a friction machine, to electrify the skin&#151;the &#145;electric bath&#146;&#151;or galvanic, where power supplied from a battery delivered a shock. Bird, a member of the London Electrical Society, sought to dissociate hospital specialized treatments from the quacks' claims for electricity as a universal panacea. He was put in charge of the new electrical treatment room at Guy's, where he investigated the value of shock treatment to relieve paralysed limbs and the action of electricity on the nervous system. His series of lectures to the Royal College of Physicians in March 1847 discussed electricity in its physiological and therapeutical relationships, showing its rational applications and linking these to the work of other reputable scientists. The lectures were published in the <span class="italic">London Medical Gazette</span> during the year, and were well received beyond the medical world.<br>
<br>Bird joined the freemasons in 1841 but left in 1853; he was also a member of the Linnean and Geological societies, and was elected fellow of the Royal Society in January 1846. He was also a corresponding member of several learned societies in Europe. Bird was an active Christian and thought of himself as both a physical and a spiritual healer. His ambition was to form a Christian Medical Association, and a resolution to this end was passed by a group of like-minded friends at his London home on 17 December 1853; he did not live to take part in the first public meeting, held in November 1854. By the late 1840s he was beginning to suffer the recurrent attacks of illness diagnosed by his brother and other colleagues as heart disease. A long holiday with his wife at Tenby, in Pembrokeshire, while it afforded him the leisure to take up his earlier interest in botany, did not effect a cure. He resigned his hospital appointments on 4 August 1853 and the following year retired from practice. He purchased an estate, St Cuthbert, at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and stayed at Hastings while the house was being renovated, but his enjoyment of his new property was brief, for he died at St Cuthbert on 27 October 1854. He was buried at Tunbridge Wells cemetery. Bird's widow founded at Guy's Hospital the Golding Bird gold medal and scholarship for bacteriology, and one of his sons, Cuthbert H. Golding Bird, followed his father as lecturer in physiology and assistant surgeon at Guy's.<br>
