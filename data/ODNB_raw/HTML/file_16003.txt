</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lany,  Benjamin</span>  (1591&#150;1675), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, was born in Ipswich, Suffolk, the fourth of at least five sons, and one of twelve children of John Lany (<i>bap</i>. 1547, <i>d</i>. 1633), barrister and recorder of the town, and his wife, Mary (1551?&#150;1633), daughter of John Poolie, esquire, of Badley in the same county. He matriculated as a pensioner from Christ's College, Cambridge, in July 1608, graduating BA in 1612 and proceeding MA in 1615. Elected a fellow of Pembroke College in 1616, he was ordained deacon and priest in February 1619, and became first curate of Harston, Cambridgeshire, and then, from 1619 to 1624, vicar of Madingley, also in Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile in 1622 he proceeded BD.<br>
<br>In 1625, at the king's request, Lany was given two years' leave of absence from Pembroke to be chaplain to Sir Edward Barrett, then appointed ambassador to France. Not only did he retain his fellowship and emoluments, but he was also elected college praelector in philosophy for a year. Bishop Richard Neile of Durham recognized Lany as an impressive scholar and preacher, and perhaps assisted his preferment in 1626 to Hambledon, Hampshire. From 1627 to 1629 he was absent from Pembroke and gained other Hampshire preferments. Following Neile's translation to Winchester in 1628 the bishop presented him to Waltham Bishops and made him his chaplain in 1629, and presented him to Buriton with Petersfield; he made him a prebendary of Winchester in 1631. In the metropolitan visitation of 1635 he was active as a commissary investigating migration of English families to the Huguenot congregation in Southampton.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1630 Lany proceeded DD. On Christmas day that year, through the considerable influence of Neile and of Bishop William Laud of London, he was elected master of Pembroke College. He did not prove a good administrator, so records from his mastership are deficient or non-existent. However, he was probably responsible for building the north side of the second court and extending the master's lodge, and was certainly responsible for the college hall. He also ensured that the chapel was repaired. Richard Crashaw, a devoted pupil, suggests that it lost its austerity in worship, and perhaps that vestments were introduced. Lany beautified the altar with tapers and many-coloured draperies and hangings, and possibly raised it at the east end. Perhaps he was responsible for the cherubim and eighty &#145;superstitious&#146; pictures destroyed by the parliamentary commissioners in 1642. Much of the Sunday service was sung by a small choir, with anthems, accompanied by an organ, replacing psalms. Bowing towards the altar and facing east were stressed. The number of Arminian fellows was notable; some, like Mr Randall, insisted that students should subscribe to Whitgift's three articles before graduating. Seven were complained of in 1641. These included Eleazor Duncon, who had argued that good works were necessary to salvation and had been favoured by Lany as moderator in 1633. Another fellow, John Turnay, preached in 1634 against Roman Catholic charges of antinomianism, arguing that faith worked with love in good works, increasing justification. He was brought before the vice-chancellor's court, and was later denied his BD for repeating this. Lany successfully resisted his condemnation, and perhaps secured Charles I's intervention in Turnay's favour.<br>
<br>In 1632&#150;3 Lany was vice-chancellor of the university. In this capacity he took a lead in prosecuting puritans and Calvinists, as in the cases of Richard Spinke of St John's College, who made a commonplace against clerical absenteeism, ceremonies, and chapel ornamentation, and Lionel Gatford, fellow of Jesus College, who preached against Arminianism. Later Lany was one of the group who defended it in the vice-chancellor's court. In 1634 he supported Peter Hausted of Queens' College in abusively advocating ceremonies, and attacking lectures and chaplaincies. In 1636, when John Normanton of Gonville and Caius College attacked justification by faith alone, and praised fasting and penance, Lany supported him in refusing to give a copy of his sermon to the vice-chancellor unless articles were brought against him. When in 1637 Sylvester Adams preached in Great St Mary's that confession to a priest was necessary to salvation, the non-Laudian heads of house regarded this as popish, and urged recantation. Lany was one of those dissenting because he did not wish to discourage auricular confession. In 1640 he was among the doctors who acquitted William Norwich of Peterhouse when accused of preaching that people were justified by works as well as faith. With other Arminian heads of house he repeatedly helped secure similar acquittals.<br>
<br>Lany's stance led to his being appointed a royal chaplain in 1634, and he served annually thereafter. In June 1639 he was made prebendary of Westminster Abbey. However, his actions and attitudes made him an object of opprobium and suspicion to puritans, especially when prot&eacute;g&eacute;s like John Normanton became Roman Catholics; in <span class="italic">Canterburies Doome</span> William Prynne described Lany as one of Laud's creatures. On the outbreak of the civil war Pembroke College sent all its plate, except the foundress's and anathema cups, to the king. When, with other heads of houses, Lany refused a contribution to parliament and the imposition of an oath which would have forced him to betray his colleagues, he became a prime target for sequestration. In March 1644 the earl of Manchester had him ejected from the mastership &#145;for opposing the proceedings of Parliament and other scandalous acts&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Lany then joined Charles I at Oxford as his chaplain, and became nominally dean of Rochester, though instituted only in 1660. In 1644, with Gilbert Sheldon and others, he was selected to debate on church government with ministers seeking further reformation before the Scots commissioners, but was refused a hearing. He also attended the unsuccessful negotiations with the presbyterians at Uxbridge in February 1645. By May he had been sequestrated from Buriton.<br>
<br>After the parliamentary victory in the first civil war Lany, in danger of imprisonment, fled to France, and became one of the close-knit group of Arminian clergy there. They regarded themselves as a faithful remnant of the Church of England whose function was to preserve it against presbyterianism, and worked in hardship to nurture the faith and preserve the worship of the scattered royalist refugees. They also battled to prevent conversions to Roman Catholicism. As chaplain to the prince of Wales from his arrival in 1646 Lany played a vital role, especially when faced with pressure from Queen Henrietta Maria, and arguments from both Roman Catholics and presbyterians for the prince's conversion from Anglicanism. Probably the resulting theological debate, including that between Bishop John Bramhall and Thomas Hobbes on free will which prompted the latter's <span class="italic">A Letter on Liberty and Necessity</span>, also led to Lany's <span class="italic">Observations</span>, eventually published with it in 1676. In it he argues against Hobbes's psychological and theological determinism, and in favour of free will as essential to the nature of virtue and vice, religion, and society itself.<br>
<br>By 1659 Lany's stature was sufficient for secretary Edward Hyde to consider him as a candidate for a bishopric, though doubting his willingness. He was wrong. On 2 December 1660 Lany was consecrated as bishop of Peterborough, and he was one of the twelve episcopal commissioners nominated by Charles II to review the prayer book at the Savoy conference in 1661, though he took little part. His six published court sermons, delivered between 1661 and 1666 and in 1675, elucidate his views. He emphasizes godly living and liturgical worship in the tradition of the early church, especially the eucharist, an offering of praise to honour Christ's redemptive sacrifice. Sacraments are divinely instituted; sermons are less important, and liable to be affected by man's fallibility. They should be measured against scripture, easily comprehended, and applied to the hearers' lives. He upholds episcopal ordination and emphasizes the importance of retaining creeds and confessions of faith as yardsticks of orthodoxy. The church's guidance, and skills of &#145;shepherds&#146;, although not infallible, are more reliable than individual interpretations. He argues that the king has a certain jurisdictional, administrative, and even authorizing power over ministry, because, presumably, he nominates bishops. Politically, he is supreme, and the only legitimate source of authority. &#145;The Sword is the Kings, and <i>He that takes it</i> from any hand but His, where God hath placed it, shall perish with the Sword&#146;  (&#145;A sermon preached &hellip; at White hall, March 18th 1665&#146;, B. Lany, <span class="italic">Five Sermons</span>, 1669, 133&#150;4). He deeply deplores schism as a sin, referring to some nonconformists as wolves in sheep's clothing who misuse phrases such as &#145;God's glory&#146; and &#145;Christian liberty&#146; to justify religious and political anarchy in place of constructive order and discipline. Lany deplores the Levellers' and others' preaching against minority land ownership, and the Quakers' refusal to honour their social betters, and argues that those organizing congregations, giving laws on worship and doctrine, and setting up teachers and leaders are acting outside their sphere. He regards claims to be led by the Holy Spirit as almost certainly deceptive, and is deeply distrustful of action on grounds of conscience. Such views mean that he deplores the idea of a comprehensive church. &#145;I think it might better have been called a Drag-net, that will fetch in all kinds of Fish, good or bad, great or small&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Last Sermon Preached at Court by B. L.</span>, 1675, 26).<br>
<br>Thus, as bishop of Peterborough, Lany's attitude to nonconformists was unlikely to be tolerant. At his 1662 visitation before the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> came into force, he told his clergy, &#145;Not I but the law&#146;, giving the impression that he washed his hands of dissenters  (B. Lany, <span class="italic">Articles of Visitation and Enquiry</span>, 1662). Forty-one ministers in the diocese either resigned just before the St Bartholomew's day deadline and became nonconformists or were subsequently deprived and did the same, like Daniel Cawdrey of Great Billing. As the judicial affairs of the diocese were handled by the civilian lawyer Dr George Wake, vicar-general in spirituals and principal official, a very legal approach was likely. One glimmer of latitude appears in the case of Richard Gascoyne, minister of Warmington, who continued to reside, though not episcopally ordained until June 1663, presumably because he was persuaded to conform. Careful enquiries were made in Lany's primary visitation as to whether the churches had returned to all practices enjoined by law or canon, with a special admonition to forward names of confirmation candidates. Investigation of the names of heretics or schismatics took prime place in questions on parishioners' conduct.<br>
<br>Inheriting a ruined palace, and with his first year's revenues due to the king as first fruits, Lany continued as a prebendary of Westminster and master of Pembroke College, to both of which he had been restored in 1660. He lived mostly at his Westminster house, making excursions to the diocese for spiritual duties. He was generous in repairing civil war damage to the cathedral, and, with John Cosin's aid as dean, the nave and choir were reordered.<br>
<br>In 1662 Lany resigned his mastership and the following year his prebend, and in April 1663 he was translated to Lincoln diocese. His visitation articles, published in 1664, show that he followed the same policies as at Peterborough, although he admitted tolerating a few nonconformists like Samuel Ainsworth, who preached at Brampton, adjoining Lany's palace at Buckden. In 1667 he was translated to the wealthy see of Ely, and statutorily became a governor of Charterhouse, London. His generosity was notable. He rescued his nephew from ruin by a gift of &pound;3600, helped many other poor relatives, left &pound;500 each for the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral and the establishment of a grammar school in Cambridge, or the increase of Pembroke fellowships, as well as establishing a trust for apprenticing poor children at Soham, Cambridgeshire. His monument describes him as being of terrifying acuteness. Perhaps there is truth in the anecdote that he told the new provost of Eton, who was seeking favours, that his head was too little to have anything in it. Lany was an active member of the House of Lords until 1672, taking increased responsibility on committees with greater seniority. He died unmarried at Ely House, London, on 24 January 1675, and was buried in Ely Cathedral.<br>
