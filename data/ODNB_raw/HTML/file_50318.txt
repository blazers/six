<span class="headword">Burn,  Amos</span>  (1848&#150;1925), <span class="occ">chess player</span>, was born on 31 December 1848 at 28 Bourne Street, Kingston upon Hull. He was the third surviving son (there were also three daughters) of Amos Burn (1810&#150;1877), a timber merchant and commission agent of Scottish descent, and his wife, Mary Webster (<i>b</i>. 1813). Burn was educated at local schools in Hull, and joined his father's mercantile business as a teenager. About 1862 he moved to Liverpool as an apprentice to a firm of shipowners and merchants. Burn was to make his home chiefly in Liverpool for many decades and is regarded as probably the strongest chess player to have lived there. He learned the moves of chess at the age of sixteen&#151;unusually late for a world-class player&#151;and joined the Liverpool chess club in 1867. He immediately made his mark by winning the club's annual tournament for 1867&#150;8 ahead of twenty-five seasoned players.<br>
<br>Burn was unusual among first-rate players in remaining an amateur rather than a full-time player who earned a living&#151;or attempted to earn one&#151;as a professional chess player. Throughout his life Burn was in business as a merchant, first as a cotton broker and then as a sugar broker, chiefly, it seems, in Liverpool's trade with America. Burn's amateur status cut both ways: his business commitments forced him to abandon chess tournaments for years on end, a factor that unquestionably affected his performances for the worse. On the other hand, he also managed to avoid the hand-to-mouth existence of the professional chess player of his time, often involving penury and near starvation, and was able to pick and choose the tournaments he wished to enter.<br>
<br>In 1870 Burn spent nine months in London, where he became a pupil and friend of Wilhelm Steinitz, regarded as the unofficial world chess champion (and officially holding the title from 1886 to 1894), the Prague-born master player and chess theorist, who was then living in England. Burn is often known as a disciple of Steinitz, exhibiting a similar style which emphasized sound development and vigorous defence. He is thus commonly known as a defensive rather than an attacking player, a description which is somewhat inaccurate in that he also demonstrated very great attacking and tactical ability. Business commitments, including several lengthy trips to America, meant that he played only in local tournaments until the mid-1880s, while his participation in major tournaments tended to come in a series of bursts when he was able to put his business life to one side. In 1886 Burn played a match with Henry Edward Bird (1830&#150;1908), an accomplished veteran player, which ended in a 9&#150;9 tie. In the same year he also drew a match with another strong British player, George Henry Mackenzie (1837&#150;1891). Also in 1886 Burn played in his first major tournament, the second British Chess Association championship in London. Remarkably, Burn finished in a tie for first with J. H. Blackburne, England's leading player, although he lost the two tie-breaking games to Blackburne 1.5&#150;0.5, finishing second in the tournament. During the next four years Burn was an active player, usually winning those tournaments he entered, or coming close, and participating in international events for the first time. His most significant results of this period were equal first with Isidor Gunsberg (1854&#150;1930) at the London tournament of 1887, and his result at the international tournament at Breslau, Germany, where he finished second to Siegbert Tarrasch, but ahead of a string of well-known grandmasters.<br>
<br>Burn then withdrew from serious chess play for five years, re-entering top-class chess to participate in the great Hastings tournament of 1895, in which virtually every leading player in the world took part. Here he finished only twelfth (out of twenty-two participants), probably the major disappointment of his career, although a result not discreditable given his long absence from active play. Over the next few years, however, he was again a fervent participant in international chess, producing an extremely impressive series of results at many international tournaments. The peak of his success was reached at the very strong tournament at Cologne in 1898, where he finished ahead of Steinitz and of three men who played or were to play for the world championship, Michael Chigorin, Carl Schlechter, and David Janowsky. The victory of a 49-year-old amateur over a recent world champion and three challengers for the throne has few parallels in chess history, and is evidence of what Burn might have achieved in an uninterrupted career. It was also probably the last major international tournament won by a British player until the 1970s. During the years 1897&#150;1900 he also achieved good results at major tournaments at Berlin in 1897 (fifth out of twenty competitors), at Vienna in 1898 (joint sixth out of twenty), at Paris in 1900 (fifth out of seventeen), and at Munich in 1900 (fourth of sixteen), ahead of many well-known grandmasters. During this period he was certainly among the best ten players in the world, possibly among the top five.<br>
<br>From 1901 Burn again withdrew from international chess, possibly because of a separation from his wife, Martha Ann (<i>b</i>. 1848/9), daughter of a sugar refiner, George J&auml;ger, whom Burn married in December 1879 at Trinity Presbyterian Church, Birkenhead. With her he had two daughters; his wife predeceased him. Also in 1901, apparent business setbacks in Liverpool took him on another extended stay to the United States, chiefly in Georgia.<br>
<br>Burn re-entered international play yet again between 1905 and 1912, often finishing among the leaders despite his advanced age. From 1912 he retired from both business life and competitive chess, although he became the editor of a chess column in <span class="italic">The Field</span> magazine from 1912 until his death. His only book on chess was revision in 1915 of James Mason's <span class="italic">Principles of Chess in Theory and Practice</span>, originally published in 1894. In the last decades of his life Burn lived in London, dying of a stroke at his home at 19 Luxemburg Gardens, Hammersmith, on 25 November 1925.<br>
<br>In appearance Burn was a thin, ascetic-looking man with a trim white beard who looked like a stage classics master or professor. He said little, and was sometimes described as morose, although he was both vocal and helpful to younger players. While he was always well known to chess historians, interest in his career was low until the 1980s, since when a number of works have restored his reputation. In particular, a magisterial biography by the Swiss historian of chess Richard Forster has received considerable attention. Forster's work contains all of Burn's 900 known games, many of which are forgotten masterpieces. The Dutch historian of chess Tim Krabb&eacute; described Burn's offer of a queen in an offhand game against E. A. MacDonald in 1910 as one of the ten greatest moves ever made in chess history.<br>
