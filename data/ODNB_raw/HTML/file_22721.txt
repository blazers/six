<span class="headword">Prescott,  Robert</span>  (1726/7&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer and governor-in-chief of British North America</span>, was born in Lancashire. His father is often given as Richard Prescott, a cavalry officer, but on what grounds is not clear. He is also sometimes described as the brother of Colonel William Prescott (1725&#150;1795) but as this Prescott was from an American family it is unlikely. Robert joined the British army as ensign in the 15th foot on 22 June 1745 and was promoted lieutenant three years later and captain on 22 January 1755. During the Seven Years' War he participated in an expedition in 1757 against Rochefort, France, and the next year in the seizure of Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island (&Icirc;le Royale). In May 1759 he became aide-de-camp to Major-General Jeffrey Amherst, colonel of his regiment, whom he accompanied in 1760 on the advance to Montreal. On 22 March 1761 Prescott was gazetted major in the 95th foot, which was ordered to Martinique in 1762. That July he exchanged into the 27th and on 10 November he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the 72nd. After the war ended he spent the following decade unattached to a regiment and probably in Britain.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the American War of Independence Prescott was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 28th foot on 8 September 1775 and took part in engagements in New York: on Long Island, in Westchester county, and at Fort Washington. Promoted brevet colonel in August 1777, he joined the expedition against Philadelphia, fighting at the battle of Brandywine the following month, and remained with the army of occupation until it retreated in 1778. That November he led the 1st brigade in an assault on the French island of St Lucia and from August 1779 to spring 1780 he commanded British troops in the Leeward Islands. He became colonel of the 94th foot on 13 October 1780 and major-general in November 1782. With the coming of peace in 1783 and disbandment of his regiment, he returned to Britain and was placed on half pay. On 6 July 1789 he was gazetted colonel of the 28th foot.<br>
<br>When war with revolutionary France broke out Prescott was promoted lieutenant-general in October 1793 and given command in Barbados. Joining the expeditionary force against the French West Indies in 1794, led by Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Grey and Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, Prescott participated in the capture of Martinique and was made the island's governor. Opinionated and irascible, he clashed with Grey over the scale of arrests and deportation of inhabitants deemed security risks, asserting his independent authority in outraged, insubordinate language. Despite this dispute Grey appointed him that September governor of Guadeloupe, captured the previous April. Soon engaged in fighting resurgent French republicans, a disheartened, sickly Prescott sought to return home. This sparked further acrimonious correspondence with Grey, until the British withdrawal from Guadeloupe in December and the departure of both men for London, where they continued their rancorous exchanges.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1796 Prescott was appointed lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada and, by a revised commission of 15 December, both governor-in-chief and commander of British forces in North America. Promoted general in January 1798, he was deeply concerned about Quebec's security against external invasion and internal subversion by disaffected French Canadians. Co-operating with Chief Justice William Osgoode and other members of the Anglophone &eacute;lite, he responded to rioting by summary arrests and the exemplary execution of David McLane, an American spy. Controversy with his councillors over a scheme to resolve the chaos in land granting led to Prescott's recall in April 1799, though he remained governor-in-chief until 1807 without returning to Canada. Resolute in action and forthright in opinion, Prescott had capabilities that were vitiated by a cantankerous temperament.<br>
<br>George Thomas Landmann of the Royal Engineers, who met Prescott in Quebec, recalled &#145;a little man, not exceeding five feet four or five inches high, very slender and certainly not much under eighty years of age; he was nevertheless active, a good officer, but exceedingly peppery&#146;  (Landmann, 1.240). Married to Susanna (<i>d</i>. 18 April 1817), with at least one daughter (who married a Captain Baldwin) and a son, he died in his eighty-ninth year on 21 December 1815 at Rose Green, near Battle, Sussex, and was buried at Winchelsea.<br>
