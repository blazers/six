<span class="headword">Langshaw,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1725, <em>d.</em> 1798), <span class="occ">organist and organ builder</span>, was baptized at All Saints' Church, Wigan, Lancashire, on 11 July 1725, the son of John Langshaw, pewterer, and Ann Aspinall. In the 1760s he worked with John Christopher Smith, Handel's amanuensis, on a large mechanical organ for the earl of Bute at Luton Park. Barrel organs were widely used in English churches in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and Langshaw's skilful work on the barrels of Bute's organ demonstrated the potential for those instruments:<blockquote>Langshaw, a very ingenious artist, was employed; and, under Smith's directions, set the barrels with so much delicacy and taste, as to convey a warm idea of the impression which the hand gives on the instrument. The organ was esteemed a masterpiece in musical mechanism. (Coxe, 53)</blockquote>Langshaw was organist of Wigan parish church from 1770 to 1772 and of Lancaster Priory and parish church from 1772 until his death. He married Mary Haydock (1732/3&#150;1800) at St James's, Westminster, on 27 May 1762. The couple had seven children and, in discussing his son John's musical education, Langshaw observed that &#145;a hundred a year (the utmost I get) will not both mentain my large family, &amp; pay the high fees some Masters demand&#146;  (J. Langshaw to C. Wesley senior, 28 Sept 1778). Langshaw died on 3 March and was buried at Lancaster Priory on 7 March 1798.<br>
<br>Langshaw's son <a name="cosubject_16035"></a><span class="headword">John Langshaw</span>  (1763&#150;1832), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born on 24 February 1763 in London. In 1778 he studied with Benjamin Cooke, organist of Westminster Abbey, but according to his father was &#145;no little mortified&#146; at Cooke's method of teaching  (J. Langshaw to C. Wesley senior, 28 Sept 1778). From 1778 to 1784 he continued his musical training in London with the younger Charles Wesley, with whom he formed a lasting friendship and whose brother Samuel also befriended him. Langshaw became a music teacher and in 1798 succeeded his father as organist at Lancaster Priory, a position which he held for the rest of his life. For many years he was a distributor of Broadwood pianos, many of which were square pianos. His published compositions included songs, a theme with variations for pianoforte or harp, and arrangements of works by Handel and Haydn. According to Sainsbury his use of &#145;the ancient style of music&#146; was an obstacle to the publication of other works, &#145;perhaps more worthy of notice&#146;, including voluntaries, concertos, songs, hymns, chants, duets, and arrangements of concertos by Geminiani. Langshaw married Sarah Grundy (1774&#150;1865) on 2 January 1800 and the couple had nine children. Langshaw died on 5 December 1832 and was buried at Lancaster Priory on 10 December.<br>
