<span class="headword">Duffy,  George Gavan</span> <span class="st"> [Seoirse  Ui Gabh&aacute;in]</span>  (1882&#150;1951), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was born at Rose Cottage, Rock Ferry, Cheshire, on 21 October 1882, the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32921/', "Sir Charles Gavan Duffy (1816&#150;1903)")</script>, the Irish nationalist who became prime minister of Victoria, Australia, and his third wife, Louise Hall (<i>c</i>.1860&#150;1889). He received his early education at the Petit S&eacute;minaire in Nice, and at Stonyhurst College. In 1907 he qualified as a solicitor in London. On 23 December 1908 he married, in Paris, Margaret (1876&#150;1967), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26771/', "Alexander Martin Sullivan")</script>, journalist and Irish nationalist MP. There were two children of the marriage, Colum and M&aacute;ire. His papers in the National Library of Ireland show that he was in regular correspondence with leaders of Irish opinion, both Unionist and nationalist, from as early as 1906. He was associated with societies exploring separatist and cultural ideas (his wife was secretary to the Irish Literary Society in London), and his interest and goodwill were actively solicited by a wide spectrum of prominent persons.<br>
<br>Duffy was forced out of legal practice in London by his partners when he acted as solicitor to Roger Casement in his trial for treason in 1916. He moved to Dublin with his family and was called to the Irish bar in 1917. In December 1918 he was elected Sinn F&eacute;in MP for South Dublin, taking his seat in the secessionist D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which opened as a constituent assembly in Dublin on 21 January 1919. He went as D&aacute;il representative to Paris, where the peace congress was being held, but was expelled from France. Fluent in Italian, as well as in French and Irish, he continued his propaganda work for Irish independence in Rome. Appointed a member of the five-man delegation to the London peace talks in October 1921, he signed the Anglo-Irish treaty two months later but made no secret of his disappointment that only dominion status had been achieved. He pleaded, without success, that the constitution of the Irish Free State be drafted to minimize the position of the crown in Irish affairs.<br>
<br>Duffy was foreign minister in the D&aacute;il cabinet from January 1922 but six months later, when the government abruptly closed the separatist D&aacute;il courts to prevent the hearing of habeas corpus applications, he resigned in protest. An unswerving advocate of human rights and the rule of law, he proposed a series of amendments in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to limit the army's emergency powers, although his efforts aroused the unremitting hostility of his kinsman Kevin O'Higgins, minister for home affairs.<br>
<br>When he lost his seat in the 1923 election Duffy devoted himself to his law practice, taking silk in 1929. He appeared in several leading cases and was appointed to the High Court in 1936, becoming its president in 1946. He was a dark-haired man with a pointed beard, well-dressed and of a decidedly continental appearance; he spoke in a precise, beautifully modulated voice with an English accent. A Roman Catholic of conviction, he possessed a strong religious sense. He had considerable personal charm but, socially shy, he spent the brief time he spared from work and study with his family. He died of lung cancer at St Vincent's Hospital, 96 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, on 10 June 1951 and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery two days later.<br>
<br>Duffy's influence on the development of Irish jurisprudence, particularly in judicial review, is widely acknowledged. He roundly defended the liberty of the individual and the concept of the rule of law against undue interference by government in cases such as <i>The State (Burke) v. Lennon</i> (1940) and <i>Buckley &amp; Ors. v. Attorney-General</i> (1950). The forceful language of these judgments mirrors the conviction of his D&aacute;il speeches in 1922&#150;3 opposing the draconian application of emergency powers, and his principled resignation from the cabinet in July 1922. In actions arising from charitable bequests he regularly and insistently expressed the belief, almost to the point of a crusade, that Irish law should evolve with some independence from common law precedent and look instead to pre-Reformation common law in construing testamentary gifts of a religious nature; he felt this particularly to be so in the light of the 1937 constitution. Modern commentators find his trenchant Catholicism&#151;although explicable by his background and times&#151;uncomfortable, and are undecided how inherent a part it played in his reasoning. No one, however, doubts the impact he has had on Irish judicial development, his remarkable intellectual energy, and his role as a champion of human rights. Professor Osborough, the legal historian, ranks him as &#145;the first judge to appreciate the significance of the Constitution for the Irish legal system. Scholarly and with an interest in law reform, Duffy demonstrated an approach to pre-1922 English and Irish case law &hellip; that was critical and heterodox&#146;  (Osborough, 160).<br>
<br>Duffy's only sister, <a name="cosubject_58613"></a><span class="headword">Louise Gavan Duffy</span> <span class="st"> [Luise Gabh&aacute;nach N&iacute; Dhufaigh]</span>  (1884&#150;1969)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Cimiez, Nice, France, on 17 July 1884, and left Nice for Dublin in 1907. After being educated at home she attended University College, Dublin, where she graduated BA in 1911 (MA 1916), and the teachers' training college at Eccles Street, Dublin. She was joint secretary of the nationalist women's organization, Cumann na mBan, and worked in the kitchens of the General Post Office during the Easter rising. In 1917 she founded Scoil Bhride, an Irish-speaking girls' school which enjoyed a considerable cultural and academic reputation. She died at 1 Kenilworth Square, Rathgar, Dublin, on 12 October 1969, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
