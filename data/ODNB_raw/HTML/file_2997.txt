<span class="headword">Bourke, Sir  Richard</span>  (1777&#150;1855), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 4 May 1777 in Britain Street, Dublin, the only son of John Bourke of Dromsally, co. Limerick, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Edmund Ryan of Boscable, co. Tipperary. He was educated at Westminster School (1788&#150;93) and at Oriel College, Oxford (BA 1798). He was gazetted ensign by purchase in the Grenadier Guards on 22 November 1798 and while on active service in the Netherlands in 1799 was shot through both jaws. In later life he felt that this wound prevented him from speaking forcefully in public and declined all invitations to stand for parliament. On 22 March 1800 he married Elizabeth Jane, daughter of John Bourke of Carshalton, Surrey. They had seven children: John (who was an invalid), Mary Jane, Anne, Frances, Richard (Dick), and two daughters who died in infancy.<br>
<br>By 27 August 1805 Bourke had attained the rank of major and in 1806 became superintendent of the junior department of the Royal Military College, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was on active service in South America, and as quartermaster-general took part in the storming of Montevideo in 1807. In 1809 he was appointed permanent assistant in the quartermaster-general's department and served in the Peninsular War. He had learned Spanish and was sent by Wellesley to contact Cuesta, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish army. In 1809 Bourke learned that his wife was gravely ill and was granted leave to return to England. On returning to Spain, he was stationed at Corunna as military resident from 1812 to 1814. In addition to his overt duties, he arranged a spy ring to gather information on enemy movements and conditions behind the enemy lines, drawing on a special secret service account to cover expenses. He was promoted colonel on 4 June 1814 and was made a CB.<br>
<br>After the war Bourke retired on half-pay and lived on his estate, Thornfield, Castleconnell, in co. Limerick. He managed his estate, became a magistrate and chairman of the Irish Distress Committee for Limerick. In 1825, finding his income inadequate for the needs of his family, he sought an appointment overseas. The tories were in power and although he was an avowed whig he made a good impression at the Colonial Office and was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Eastern District of Cape Colony. He and his family arrived in Cape Town in February 1826. When the governor, Lord Charles Somerset, returned to England on leave (and later resigned), Bourke assumed office as acting governor of the whole colony.<br>
<br>Bourke's task was not easy. The minority white population, both British and Dutch, were dissatisfied with the government, the laws were uncodified, and many of the officials inefficient and corrupt. The economy was depressed and the colony in debt. Bourke removed local dues and restrictions and by seeking markets in Mauritius and elsewhere increased exports appreciably. Government control of the press was much resented and on Bourke's recommendation its independence was secured by statute in 1829. He was instructed to reorganize the government according to the recommendations of a commission of inquiry appointed by the British government; this difficult task was accomplished by May 1828.<br>
<br>The most controversial part of Bourke's governorship (which was regarded either as &#145;Bourke's wicked reign&#146; or as most enlightened) was his native policy. He tried to improve the conditions of free persons of colour who were bound by oppressive labour contracts and subject to a pass system which prevented them from moving freely in search of better-paid work. On 17 June 1828, after the courts had been reformed, the council passed ordinance 50 which liberated them from the pass laws and protected them from exploitation; it came to be known as the &#145;Magna Carta of the Hottentots&#146;.<br>
<br>Bourke and his family left the Cape in September 1828 and returned to Thornfield. When the whigs took office in 1830, he again sought a post and was appointed governor of New South Wales, Australia. He arrived in Sydney in December 1831; to his great sorrow, his wife died at Parramatta in May 1832. He found the colony deeply divided between the &#145;exclusive&#146; faction made up of free immigrants and their descendants and the &#145;liberals&#146; who included many emancipists (former convicts). His policies were favoured by the latter and often opposed by the former. One of his controversial measures was the substitution of civil for military juries in criminal cases, which the legislative council, though still wholly nominated, passed only on Bourke's casting vote. Another concerned the criminal law relating to convicts. He found that magistrates were not always impartial and attributed this in part to the complexity of existing regulations. He asked Chief Justice Forbes to draft a single bill consolidating the law and reducing the magistrates' powers. It was passed by the legislature but severely criticized by many landowners and in the press.<br>
<br>Another controversial issue related to religion. Bourke had seen the evil effects of sectarian intolerance in Ireland and believed that there should be no attempt to establish a dominant colonial church. Despite opposition from the Anglican Bishop Broughton, <span class="roman">Church Acts</span> were passed by the legislature in 1836 which gave support from public funds to the major denominations in proportion to their numbers.<br>
<br>A further important measure was the <span class="roman">Crown Lands Occupation Act</span> of 1836, which provided for the issuing of occupation licences for pastoral purposes on unsurveyed crown land. Much of this had been illegally occupied by squatters to the detriment of the revenue. Under Bourke's legislation commissioners of crown lands were appointed to collect licence fees and also to act as magistrates. Many squatters had crossed the straits from Van Diemen's Land and settled in the Port Phillip district (later Victoria). In 1836 Bourke appointed a resident magistrate for Port Phillip and in 1837 himself visited the area, had a plan of streets drawn up, and the first building sites measured and offered for sale. &#145;I have had much pleasure in affixing Whig names in the Bush,&#146; he wrote. He travelled widely throughout the colony and he strongly supported the British government's plans for &#145;assisting&#146; migration by introducing the &#145;bounty&#146; system, whereby those who arranged to bring out approved migrants were paid a bounty from the crown land revenue. This brought out 50,000 migrants between 1838 and 1842, though while Bourke was governor arriving convicts and free migrants had already raised the population he had to deal with from 51,000 in 1831 to over 97,000 in 1838.<br>
<br>Bourke resigned his office in December 1837. C. D. Riddell, the colonial treasurer, had disobeyed his orders and Bourke dismissed him from the executive council. The secretary of state ruled that he had no power to do so and ordered that Riddell be reinstated. Believing that his personal honour was in jeopardy, Bourke resigned. The popular esteem in which he was held was shown by the great ovation the crowd gave him as he left the colony. A fund was opened, and rapidly filled, to erect his statue, which stands before the Public Library of New South Wales, in Sydney.<br>
<br>Bourke had been made KCB in 1835 and gazetted lieutenant-general and colonel-in-chief of the 64th regiment in 1837. In 1839 he was appointed high sheriff for the county of Limerick; he was offered, but declined, the governorship of Jamaica and the command-in-chief of the forces in India; he was promoted general in 1851. In collaboration with Earl Fitzwilliam, he edited the correspondence of his kinsman Edmund Burke, published in 1844. Bourke died of heart failure at Thornfield, on 13 August 1855, and was buried in the churchyard at Castleconnell.<br>
