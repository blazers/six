<span class="headword">Thoresby,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1373), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, came of a family that took its name from the Lincolnshire village of North Thoresby, in Lindsey. Styled <i>magister</i> by 1326, he had graduated as bachelor of canon law at Oxford by 1341, having served between 1326 and 1334 as chaplain and attorney to William Melton, archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1340), who secured for him a position in chancery. During the 1330s and early 1340s Thoresby was frequently employed as a diplomat, on missions to France and the papal curia. Keeper of the privy seal between July 1345 and September 1347, he accompanied Edward III on his French campaigns of those years; and on 16 June 1349 he was promoted to the chancellorship. His civil service income was supplemented by the revenue from a total of twenty-one benefices, all no more than profitable sinecures. Crown service prevented him from making much impact on his first two dioceses, St David's (1347&#150;9) and Worcester (1350&#150;52); and when Edward III advanced Thoresby to the see of York in 1352 he ensured that his two most trusted ministers were in control of the English church&#151;Simon Islip (<i>d</i>. 1366), keeper of the regency government's seal in 1346 and keeper of the privy seal after Thoresby, had been appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 1349. The bull licensing Thoresby's translation to York was issued by the pope on 17 November 1352, and the temporalities were restored on 8 February 1353, though he was not enthroned until 8 September 1354. As archbishop Thoresby continued to further crown interests, for instance, ordering prayers of thanksgiving throughout his diocese in 1356 for the victory of Poitiers, and zealously enforcing collections of clerical tenths which helped to finance Edward III's wars.<br>
<br>On 27 November 1356 Thoresby resigned as chancellor. The energy he subsequently devoted to the administration of his diocese, in which he would be continually in residence, suggests that he welcomed the opportunity to give exclusive priority for the first time in his life to diocesan administration. Thoresby's friendship with Islip and the diplomatic skills he had acquired in government service were applied to the ending of the long-standing dispute between the archbishops of Canterbury and York over the right to bear the primatial cross in each other's province. In 1353 it was agreed that each archbishop could bear his cross in the province of the other. Thoresby also devoted the wealth he had amassed as a crown servant and ecclesiastical careerist to building projects in his cathedral. He laid the foundations of the new choir in York Minster in 1360, making an immediate donation of 100 marks and contributing &pound;200 a year until his death, and he also built the lady chapel in the east end of the cathedral.<br>
<br>Thoresby's qualities as an experienced government official and administrator made him realistic in his attempts to discipline layfolk and to cater for their social and moral welfare. His first pastoral initiative was to restore the morale of the clergy in a diocese suffering from the after-effects of the black death of 1348&#150;9. Morale was low among the religious communities where mortality rates were high; not only did he undertake visitations of monasteries in the diocese in 1352&#150;3, but he also issued commissions of inquiry into the condition of certain houses. Mortality rates were also high among parish priests; the consequent shortage of parochial incumbents was exacerbated by the way in which many parish priests deserted their parishes to profit from the increasing demand for chantry priests to celebrate for the souls of victims of plague. Thoresby responded by ordaining more priests, usually officiating at ordination services himself. In 1361 and 1362 he issued pastoral mandates enforcing residence in the chapter at York and in the archdeaconries in the diocese. Among the constitutions he issued in September 1367, and had approved before the northern convocation, was legislation echoing the <span class="roman">Statute of Labourers</span> of 1350, which fixed wages of stipendiary chaplains at 6 marks and forbade clergy to leave their parishes to work in chantries. He also issued instructions forbidding clergy to depute the administration of any sacraments to laymen, something that had occurred during plague years when laymen had felt obliged to hear confession and celebrate mass for want of a priest.<br>
<br>Thoresby's most important pastoral reform was his plan to improve the religious instruction of the laity, embodied in a Latin injunction recorded in the archbishop's register on 25 November 1357. After prefatory remarks on the ignorance of the laity and the need for instruction in the vernacular, Thoresby suggests the items on which teaching is needed: the articles of faith, the commandments, the works of mercy, the cardinal virtues, the sacraments, and the deadly sins. So that the clergy have no doubt as to what information should be given on these matters, a brief exposition of each in turn is given. The injunction concludes with an exhortation to the clergy to convey this information and to examine their parishioners on their knowledge of it during confession, and with a promise to the laity of forty days' indulgence for those whose knowledge and practice of the material is adequate. This programme of instruction (in which there is envisaged a significant extension of the scope of the sacrament of penance by thus including an examination of penitents' religious knowledge) was modelled on that published in 1281 by Archbishop John Pecham of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1292), which was itself issued in response to the demands of the Lateran Council of 1215, which made annual confession to the parish priest compulsory.<br>
<br>Thoresby's injunction, and the instructions accompanying it, are preceded in his register by an expanded vernacular version of the teaching, which refers to Thoresby's ordinance and to his indulgence. The author of this English text, which was made at Thoresby's behest, was John Gaytryge, a Benedictine monk of St Mary's Abbey, York, who stayed in Thoresby's household in December 1356. Presented in rough, alliterative verse to facilitate memorization, this so-called <span class="italic">Lay Folk's Catechism</span> is a penitential handbook whose originality lies in its simplicity and conciseness. Its appeal is shown by its wide circulation. There are twenty-six surviving manuscripts, many reworked with interpolated texts; and it gained considerable currency outside the diocese. Archbishop Islip seems to have followed Thoresby's example, for in 1361 he provided a <span class="italic">Brevis libellus</span> (which does not survive) on the seven deadly sins and ten commandments for the use of the clergy of his province.<br>
<br>In such legislation as the 1357 injunction, and in <span class="italic">The Lay Folk's Catechism</span>, Thoresby tried to instil in parishioners a sense of community, with the parish church as the focus for order and stability of life. His legislation expresses concern over the high levels of violence among clergy and laity in a society where vendettas were pursued. He envisaged that during annual confession priests would discover if parishioners harboured hostile attitudes towards their neighbours, and then impose penances whose performance would reconcile them to their communities. Thoresby may also have been behind such other vernacular pastoral initiatives as the religious plays. The <span class="roman">York Corpus Christi</span> cycle of forty-eight biblical plays was first performed by the York craft guilds on the feast of Corpus Christi around the time of the publication of <span class="italic">The Lay Folk's Catechism</span>. These plays, written by clergy of the diocese and probably supervised by the York Minster clergy, were an important means of transmission of biblical education.<br>
<br>Thoresby had considerable influence on the careers of his kinsmen. Yorkshire clerks had been prominent in secular government since the reign of Edward I, and Thoresby perpetuated this tradition, ensuring that members of his family held important positions in chancery until the reign of Richard II. Thus he may be presumed to have introduced into government circles his brother Ralph Thoresby, who was keeper of the hanaper from 1345 to 1357, and his relations by marriage Richard and John Ravenser, both of whom also became keeper of the hanaper. Richard Ravenser, moreover, was archdeacon of Lincoln between 1368 and 1386. And the archbishop's great-nephews John and William Waltham were later to be keeper of the privy seal, and later treasurer, and keeper of the hanaper, respectively. Two other nephews, a younger John Waltham, a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, who became an official in the court of York in 1367, and another John Thoresby, who incepted as doctor of civil law at Oxford in 1356, lectured there on canon and civil law, and became provost of Beverley in 1373, also had their paths made easier by their uncle's patronage. The great theologian John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384), who was probably ordained priest in York Minster in 1351, may have been introduced to his patron, Archbishop Islip, by Thoresby. Wyclif was a contemporary at Merton and Balliol of Thoresby's nephews Dr John Thoresby and John Waltham. His later emphasis on the performance of pastoral duty, condemnation of non-residence, and belief in the importance of the vernacular dissemination of religious knowledge may well owe much to early exposure to the reforming ambitions of Thoresby and his followers.<br>
<br>In his surviving letters Thoresby emerges as an urbane, courtly man, with a sense of humour and a high regard for good wine and friendship, especially among his old chancery colleagues. He died at Bishopthorpe on 6 November 1373 and is buried in his lady chapel in York Minster. A good illustration of the truth that civil servants and lawyers, when they had the opportunity, could make good pastors, by raising standards of religious knowledge and moral awareness in his diocese, Thoresby, with his clerks, laid the foundations for a perceptible growth of lay piety and dissemination of devotional literature there towards the end of the fourteenth century. They also established principles of pastoral care that enabled the next generation of York clergy to adapt the pastoral office from the provision of basic religious instruction to controlling and moderating the religious enthusiasm that had been aroused among the laity by Yorkshire mystical writers.<br>
