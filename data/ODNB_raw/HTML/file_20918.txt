<span class="headword">Oswald</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1006&#150;1042), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and scholar</span>, was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20917/', "St Oswald")</script>, archbishop of York. The earliest period of Oswald's life was spent as an oblate at Ramsey. According to the twelfth-century <span class="italic">Liber benefactorum</span> of Ramsey, he was one of the four schoolboys who, in the time of Abbot Eadnoth (992&#150;1006), cracked one of the monastery's bells by pulling frivolously and inexpertly on the bell-ropes; their teachers (one of whom was probably Byrhtferth of Ramsey) and the monks threatened them with severe punishment, but they were pardoned by Eadnoth. Oswald subsequently travelled to the continent, visiting St Omer, Arras, Corbie, St Denis in Paris, and then Lagny; he ended up studying at Fleury (as his uncle had done before him). His travels and accomplishments at Fleury were recorded in a poem by Constantine, a monk of Fleury who later became abbot of Micy (<i>d</i>. 1021); although the poem is lost, it was composed in elegiacs and addressed to Bishop Oswald, and was seen in manuscript by John Leland (<i>d</i>. 1552), who made a note of its content. Oswald subsequently returned to Ramsey, where he led a life of quiet study, becoming a man &#145;renowned for his erudition and piety&#146;, according to the <span class="italic">Liber benefactorum</span>  (<span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae Rameseiensis</span>, 159&#150;60); the same source records that he turned down the offer of a bishopric, preferring to pursue his literary studies at Ramsey. On the occasion of a visit by Edward the Confessor (<i>r</i>. 1042&#150;66) to Ramsey, Oswald successfully petitioned the king for a grant of estates at Wimbotsham and Downham Market, Norfolk; the original charter does not survive, but the grant is recorded in a document dated 1060 but forged in the twelfth century by Osbert of Clare  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1030).<br>
<br>Oswald's scholarly activity resulted in a substantial corpus of writing, most of which has unfortunately perished. The <span class="italic">Liber benefactorum</span> records that in the Ramsey library there was a volume of Oswald's poetry, which gave evidence of his &#145;multifarious learning and acute ingenuity&#146;, but this volume has not survived  (<span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae Rameseiensis</span>, 160). Leland was familiar with two further works: a <span class="italic">Liber sacrarum precationum</span> (said by Leland to be partly in verse, partly in prose), and a treatise <span class="italic">De componendis epistolis</span> cast in the form of a letter. John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563) added to this list a work entitled <span class="italic">De edendis carminibus</span>. All of these have apparently been lost. Leland records that he had seen two manuscripts of Oswald's writings, one at Glastonbury, the other at Ramsey; but they have perished. However, two brief poems have been identified as the work of Oswald: both are preserved in a mid-eleventh-century manuscript from Canterbury (now in Cambridge University Library, MS Gg.5.35), and both are in an elaborate metrical form known as <i>versus retrogradi</i>: that is to say, the metre is preserved whether they are read forwards or backwards. The first, consisting of twenty-one hexameters, begins &#145;Centum concito sic qui nouit condere versus&#146; (&#145;he who knows how to compose quickly a hundred lines in this manner&#146;). It contains an indication of Oswald's authorship in line 9: &#145;istos texuit Oswoldus, qui est nescius artis&#146; (&#145;Oswald, who is ignorant of the art, composed these [lines]&#146;). The second, in four elegiac distichs, begins<blockquote>
<div>Terrigene bene nunc laudent, ut condecet, almum<br>
</div>
<div>vocibus excelsis sic sibi perplacitis.<br>
</div>(Let earth-dwellers now duly praise the kindly God, as is fitting, with celestial voices pleasing to him.)</blockquote>
