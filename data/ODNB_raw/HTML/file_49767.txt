<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hart <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ridehalgh]</span>,  Judith</span>, Baroness Hart of South Lanark  (1924&#150;1991), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 51 Ennismore Street, Burnley, Lancashire, on 18 September 1924, the daughter of Harry Ridehalgh, linotype operator, and later secretary of a mechanics' institute, and his wife, Lily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lord, schoolteacher and Baptist lay preacher. Baptized Constance Mary, at the age of twelve she adopted the name Judith. She was educated at Burnley primary school and Clitheroe Royal Grammar School, where she was head prefect, before a scholarship took her to the London School of Economics (LSE). The mass unemployment she had witnessed in 1930s Lancashire converted her to socialism and at eighteen she joined the Labour Party, becoming secretary of the Cambridge University Labour Club during the LSE's wartime evacuation to Cambridge. After receiving a first-class degree in sociology in 1945 and teaching briefly at a training college in Portsmouth she married Dr Anthony Bernard (Tony) Hart (1917&#150;1999), research chemist, on 17 April 1946; they later had two sons. They had met at a meeting where he gave a speech against the nuclear bomb. His similar political views (he was later a Richmond borough councillor) and support for her career were important to her throughout her life. Soon after their marriage his work took them to Dorset where she became a researcher for the Ministry of Health and a co-opted member of the Dorset county council public health committee.<br>
<br>Hart entered politics in Dorset, running unsuccessfully for Parkstone municipal council at twenty-five and for the parliamentary constituency of Dorset West in 1951. Four years later, after the Harts had moved to Scotland, she reduced Lady Tweedsmuir's majority in the hard-fought &#145;battle of the housewives&#146; in Aberdeen South, where her beauty was the source of some comment. During this time she made broadcasts on BBC's <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>, wrote articles on Scottish affairs for <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> (she was an early devolutionist), and lectured in sociology. When offered the more promising constituency of Lanark she decided that she could do more for people's welfare as an MP than as a lecturer.<br>
<br>After Judith received the nomination for Lanark, Tony withdrew as PPC for Glasgow Hillhead to campaign for his wife. She was elected in October 1959 and her family eventually joined her in London, where her mother-in-law helped raise her two sons. Although her own mother had died when Hart was fifteen she had imparted to her a strong pacifist philosophy, and the issue of disarmament dominated Hart's early parliamentary career. She served on the national committee of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, joined the first Aldermaston march, and tried to initiate parliamentary debates on the Christmas Island nuclear tests and the police raid on the offices of the controversial anti-nuclear Committee of 100. The <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> retracted its claim that she belonged to the committee after she sued the editors, but some still found such views as her opposition to Britain's membership of NATO immoderate.<br>
<br>None the less when Labour came to power in October 1964 Prime Minister Harold Wilson appointed Hart a joint parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, partly as she had been one of the few Scottish MPs to support him for the leadership over George Brown. Her responsibilities included health, children, and education and she energetically promoted school-building in Scotland, but she felt it was important to have responsibility for areas outside women's traditional sphere in order to be seen as a credible politician. One of her interests was decolonization, and after Labour's re-election in April 1966 she was made minister of state at the Commonwealth Office. As minister she sought African leaders' support for sanctions against Rhodesia, and assured her party that the government would not capitulate to Rhodesia's illegal white minority regime. After only one year in this portfolio she became minister of social security, in July 1967, to implement spending cuts resisted by her predecessor, Margaret (Peggy) Herbison. She surprised colleagues with criticism of &#145;work-shy young people who think they are God's gift to poetry and guitar playing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 9 Dec 1991). Her role at social security caused ill-feeling in Lanarkshire, where Herbison was her very popular constituency neighbour.<br>
<br>In October 1968 Hart entered the cabinet as paymaster general, but frequently quarrelled with Wilson and especially irked him with her assertion that she had overall responsibility for government announcements  (Crossman, 3.368). Following her attack on the government's plan for union reform, <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span>, she was dropped from the cabinet in October 1969 and was moved to the Ministry of Overseas Development, which Wilson had created in 1964. Her decision to award pensions to expatriate colonial officers living in former dependencies won praise, but she served for less than a year before Labour was defeated in June 1970. The election also ended her brief tenure as first co-chair of the Women's National Commission.<br>
<br>In opposition Hart retained the overseas development portfolio and published <span class="italic">Aid and Liberation</span> (1973), based on her first-hand research in the Third World, where she became known and respected. This book called for &#145;socialist&#146; aid to replace &#145;neo-colonial&#146; aid, the cancellation or rescheduling of Third World debt, and an end to private investment in the Third World which primarily benefited the investors. She warned about the impact of EEC membership on British aid, and tried to amend the <span class="roman">European Communities Bill</span> to safeguard Britain's more generous aid programme.<br>
<br>After returning to her old ministry in March 1974 Hart spent over 200 hours negotiating with her EEC counterparts to achieve the Lom&eacute; convention, signed in 1975. This provided for aid from members of the community to forty-six of the world's poorest countries, and was her foremost accomplishment. Her book, <span class="italic">Aid and Liberation</span>, had also recommended using aid to support left-leaning governments and destabilize oppressive right-wing governments, and she was instrumental in cancelling aid to Chile after Labour's return to power. She welcomed many Chilean refugees into her home and hosted the widow of the slain Marxist president, Salvador Allende, but her association with communists and her speech at a rally organized by the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span> in 1974 attracted the interest of MI5. Her telephones were tapped, partly because of confusion with a communist, Mrs Tudor Hart, but nothing was uncovered which Wilson felt warranted her dismissal. He did demand an assurance that she and two colleagues would uphold the principle of collective ministerial responsibility after they had supported resolutions of the party's national executive committee (NEC) criticizing the government over arms sales to Chile and a joint naval exercise with South Africa.<br>
<br>To a certain extent Hart's interest in overseas affairs came at the expense of attention to local concerns, and despite her sympathy with radical and left-wing causes some felt that she lacked the common touch, though many constituents still remembered her fondly. Contemporaries described her as cool and efficient, though sometimes as aggressive and strident in public speeches, lacking in humour, and elegant in appearance and dress. In Richard Crossman's view &#145;she is a competent, efficient woman, not tremendously creative in mind, lacking many good ideas and a bit slapdash, but she is dashing, courageous, with a good political instinct for being on the right side&#146;  (Crossman, 3.311). Her sometimes grand manner and sense of self-importance led her to disregard the Foreign Office when making policy, which contributed to her department's being brought under its auspices. Although she had demonstrated how Britain could co-operate with European partners she urged withdrawal from the EEC in the referendum of June 1975, warning that it would lead to a federal Europe and threatened parliamentary sovereignty. Shortly after the referendum Wilson demoted the anti-marketeers in a cabinet shuffle and she refused to accept the Ministry of Transport. Her subsequent personal statement to the house was emotional and defensive, though from the back-benches she was now free to criticize the government over spending cuts and the abandonment of plans for a new town at Stonehouse near Lanark in 1976.<br>
<br>Yet Hart remained influential within the party and the NEC, on which she served from 1969 to 1983, and returned to the overseas development portfolio in February 1977 under Prime Minister James Callaghan. During her final term she increased both the quantity and the quality of aid, converting interest-free loans into permanent grants for countries which met a minimum standard of human rights. However, she did not establish similar criteria when she chaired the Labour Southern Africa Solidarity Fund, and there was criticism over its backing of Marxist guerrillas. She replied that the violence used by dictatorships could not be equated with that used by freedom fighters.<br>
<br>To a mixture of amusement and dismay Hart became a dame of the British empire in the government's resignation honours list in May 1979, as recognition for her work for the Lom&eacute; convention but perhaps also in compensation for her failure to attain more senior office. No doubt her talents could have taken her even further had it not been for her independent streak and her tendency to annoy her superiors. She continued as party spokesman on overseas aid until 1980 and was appointed an honorary fellow of the University of Sussex's Institute of Development Studies in 1985. During her final years in the Commons she chaired the NEC (1981&#150;2) and remained one of the voices of the Labour left, opposing the Falklands War and the expulsion of the &#145;militant tendency&#146; from the party. She left the Commons at the general election of 1987. In 1988 she was elevated to the House of Lords as Baroness Hart of South Lanark and delivered her maiden speech on the security services before ill health prevented her from taking any further active part. Shortly after the end of the Pinochet regime she was to receive the order of merit from the new Chilean government, but before it could be presented she died of cancer at Queen Mary's University Hospital, Roehampton, London, on 7 December 1991. She was survived by her husband and their two sons.<br>
