<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke,  George Frederick</span>  (1756?&#150;1812), <span class="occ">actor</span>, claimed to have been born in Westminster, London, on 17 April 1756. The truth about his birth and parentage is unverifiable; perhaps the most probable scenario is that he was born out of wedlock in Dublin, possibly in a military barracks, the son of Eliza or Allison Renton and a British military man, possibly one James Moore. Little is known of his early life. He probably moved with his mother to Berwick upon Tweed, where her two sisters lived; he received some education there, and on his mother's death about 1764 was apprenticed to a printer, John Taylor. It was in Berwick too that Cooke saw his first dramatic performance, given by strolling players in the town hall about 1766. By 1769 he had been involved with amateur theatricals, and in 1771 obtained his release from Taylor and travelled to London, where he continued his amateur performances. In November 1771 he sailed to the Netherlands, probably as a cabin boy, but returned to Berwick early in 1772.<br>
<br>Over the next twenty-seven years, and despite two brief London engagements, it was as a provincial actor that Cooke made his mark: few major British actors have had to wait so long to earn recognition in the capital city. The date and place of his first professional appearance are uncertain, though it was most probably Lincolnshire between 1773 and 1775. For the next few years he was a strolling player, appearing in such towns as King's Lynn, Stamford, Brentford, and, during the summer of 1777, Hastings. In the spring of 1778 he took part in three benefit performances during the off-season at London's Haymarket Theatre, as Castalio in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> (9 April), Modely in Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">The Country Lasses</span> (29 April), and Lovewell in Garrick and Colman's <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> (30 April). Other than two additional benefits at the Haymarket in 1779, these were his last appearances in London for over twenty years. He returned to the provinces to continue his theatrical apprenticeship, where his early roles were predominantly in comedy.<br>
<br>Among Cooke's notable provincial engagements in the next few years were periods in Manchester, Lancaster, Preston, Liverpool, Chester, York, Hull, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sheffield, and Buxton. In York on 29 July 1786 he first appeared with Sarah Siddons, with whom he would later frequently appear at Covent Garden in London. In 1787 he joined Joseph Austin and Charles Whitlock's company in Manchester as a leading player; he had previously appeared with them in supporting roles. By 1794 he was a provincial star, with prestigious engagements to follow, beginning in Dublin, where his first role was Othello on 19 November 1794. His initial success there was modest, but by the spring of 1800 he had been dubbed &#145;the Dublin Roscius&#146; by the London press.<br>
<br>This formative period was critical for Cooke, for not only did he master over 300 roles, he also developed a major problem with alcohol, a reputation for unreliability, and domestic difficulties&#151;conditions that would plague him throughout his career. For example, in the summer of 1795, following a period of dissipation (and no doubt drunk at the time), he enlisted in the army, but was soon discharged through the efforts of the Portsmouth theatre manager. He married his first wife, Alicia Daniels (<i>b</i>. 1777), an actress, on 20 December 1796, though at least two other actresses had previously called themselves Mrs Cooke (one appears by this name in playbills as early as February 1775, another in 1784). Daniels had her marriage to Cooke annulled on 4 July 1801, after Cooke had finally made the move to a major London theatre.<br>
<br>In February 1800 Cooke was invited to join the Covent Garden company for the 1800&#150;01 season, and he made his d&eacute;but there on 31 October 1800 as Richard III, the role that would become his most famous. The critics were split in their opinions. Some preferred the more studied and refined style of Cooke's contemporary and competitor at Drury Lane, John Philip Kemble, while others considered Cooke a true original, one who did not imitate other actors but did in some respects resemble the great David Garrick. During his first season Cooke made his first London appearances in such notable roles as Shylock (10 November), Sir Archy MacSarcasm in Charles Macklin's <span class="italic">Love-&agrave;-la-mode</span> (added as an afterpiece to <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> on 13 November), Iago (28 November), Macbeth (5 December), Kitely in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span> (17 December), the title role in Kotzebue's <span class="italic">The Stranger</span> (27 January 1801), and Sir Giles Overreach in Massinger's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> (28 March). The following season he added two significant roles to these: Stukely in Edward Moore's <span class="italic">The Gamester</span> (27 November 1801) and Sir Pertinax McSycophant in Macklin's <span class="italic">Man of the World</span> (10 April 1802). These ten became his great parts, repeated frequently. For this auspicious first London season he managed to control his drinking. Thereafter, however, apologies for his &#145;indisposition&#146; became more and more common.<br>
<br>For the next eight years Cooke invariably took summer provincial engagements between London seasons, including several in Scotland and Ireland and in theatres in the midlands familiar from his apprentice days. The summers became something of a respite from his troubled winter seasons in London. His appearance in London for his second season was delayed, probably by a genuine illness, and on this occasion his apology was accepted, even though many believed his absence was caused by drunkenness.<br>
<br>Although it was not one of his principal roles, Cooke performed King Lear for the first time in London during his second season (8 January 1801), but it was not repeated during that season. On 11 May for the first time it was recorded publicly that his drunkenness prevented his performance. A note written on a theatre playbill in the British Library declares that &#145;Cooke attempted to perform but was too inebriated to proceed beyond a few speeches&#146; as Orsino in Matthew Lewis's <span class="italic">Alphonso, King of Castille</span>. Such occurrences now became commonplace. To complicate further Cooke's career and reputation, John Philip Kemble was engaged by Covent Garden in 1803, thus bringing their rivalry to the same stage.<br>
<br>Cooke's most discouraging season was that of 1805&#150;6, when he appeared on only fifty nights in a season of 212 nights and presented no role more than six times. The press made frequent reference to his misdeeds, as they would in the next season, even though it was his least controversial in years. When he failed to appear in Manchester in June 1807 despite an advance payment, Cooke, unable to return the advance, was confined in Appleby prison, Westmorland, from 17 August until 30 December 1807. While he was frequently in financial straits and a poor manager of his funds, his alcoholism complicated his finances, and he was known to squander large sums of money. Numerous anecdotes record examples of his generous gifts to women in distress and to other unfortunates. The most positive result of his four and a half months in prison was the diary and journal of his career, which was the closest thing to an autobiography he ever undertook.<br>
<br>Perhaps chastened by the experience, Cooke performed his professional duties without incident between January and July 1808; he returned to Covent Garden in March 1808 and performed there for at least forty-eight nights in what remained of the season. Back in Edinburgh, on 21 September 1808 he married Sarah Harvey Lamb, the daughter of John Lamb of Newark, Nottinghamshire. Little is known of her or of the marriage, not even of its dissolution (it seems to have lasted less than a year). When Cooke returned to London for the 1808&#150;9 season, Sarah accompanied him. It was a difficult period. Covent Garden had been destroyed by fire on 19 September 1808, and the company was forced to perform elsewhere. According to Arnold Hare, Cooke took Sarah back to Newark in February 1809, and she never returned. By then Cooke's London career was almost over: 1809&#150;10 was to be his last season. He was frequently required to perform during the period of the Old Price riots which began in September 1809. His final London appearance was as Shylock on 22 June 1810. With his career at a low point and, according to his first biographer, William Dunlap, discontented with his position in London, where he was constantly undermined by a hostile press, Cooke was easily persuaded by the American actor&#150;manager Thomas A. Cooper to appear in the United States under the aegis of the New York Park Theater. He sailed from Liverpool on the <i>Columbia</i> on 4 October 1810, having made his final English performance without fanfare or comment before a small country audience in Preston on 17 August.<br>
<br>Cooke made his d&eacute;but in New York on 11 November as Richard III. His reception was the most enthusiastic yet accorded an actor in the United States, and, although his reputation for drunkenness and debauchery preceded him, he was generally on his best behaviour, sobered after the long voyage, and shepherded by the playwright and manager William Dunlap during his 160 performances in New York, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Providence. His appearance as Sir Giles Overreach in Providence on 31 July 1812 was to prove to be his final performance on the stage. The visit was a lucrative one for the managers of the theatres that hosted Cooke, with receipts totalling about $250,000. But Cooke himself received only $20,000, and this, coupled with anger over the devious terms on which he felt he had been taken to America, left him resentful and drove him back to the bottle. Although he fully intended to return to England, where he had accepted an invitation to rejoin the Covent Garden company, the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14 and the subsequent American embargo on foreign-bound ships left him stranded in the United States. With his health steadily declining, Cooke returned to New York city, where he died on 26 September 1812, of cirrhosis of the liver, at the Mechanics' Hall, a well-known tavern at the corner of Broadway and Robinson Street (later Park Place). At his deathbed was his new American wife, Violet Mary Behn, the widow of a German merchant and the daughter of James Bryden, keeper of the Tontine Coffee House in New York. They had married on 20 June 1811. On 27 September 1812 Cooke's remains were placed in the strangers' vault of St Paul's Church. Edmund Kean, an admirer of Cooke's, had the actor's body reburied at the church and erected an elaborate monument during his first American tour, in 1821.<br>
<br>Cooke's accomplishment as an actor of the first order should overshadow his tainted personal reputation and quixotic career. Arguably he was the first true British romantic actor, ranking in the annals of the stage with the small group of great actors of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He was the first major foreign star on the American stage, and his appearance there marked the inception of the star system in the United States. Even after age and debilitation had all but destroyed him, Cooke's figure continued to make an impression on those who saw him on or off stage. He was 5 feet 10 inches tall, broad-chested, and had a prominent nose in shape between Roman and aquiline, expressive eyes, and (when in possession of his faculties) a dignified, self-possessed, and courteous manner, and he fascinated observers. Yet underneath this exterior was a coarseness that coloured his acting, and his voice, which was not particularly pleasant, was even hoarse on occasion. Some critics believed his awkward, grotesque movements limited his scope of characters. But in the tradition of his great predecessors David Garrick and Charles Macklin, Cooke brought a new natural style to the stage: he spoke poetry like prose and delivered soliloquies as if thinking aloud. Although he created few important new roles, he did establish a reputation for playing a line of characters noted for their grim humour, sardonic sarcasm, specious menace, savage ferocity, and baleful guile.<br>
