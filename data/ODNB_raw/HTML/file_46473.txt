<span class="headword">Kirkman <span class="st"> [Kirckman, Kirchman]</span>,  Abraham</span>  (1737&#150;1794), <span class="occ">harpsichord maker</span>, was born on 2 June 1737 at Bischweiler, near Strasbourg, the second of numerous children born to his father, Abraham Kirchmann (1704&#150;1792), of Bischweiler, and Suzanna Saucourt (formerly Omphalius). His paternal grandparents were Abraham Kirchmann (1673&#150;1754), of Bischweiler, and his second wife, Margaret Prevot (<i>d</i>. 1706). In the same year as his wife's death, that Abraham married Suzanna M. Burckhard, his third wife; their eldest child being the celebrated <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55529/', "Jacob Kirkman")</script>, founder of the Kirkman firm of harpsichord builders.<br>
<br>The young Abraham Kirkman had moved to London by 13 August 1758, when he married Charlotte Neubauer (<i>d</i>. 1798), second daughter of a London harpsichord maker, Frederic Neubauer, at St James's, Westminster. It may have been as early as 1771 that Jacob Kirkman took his nephew Abraham into partnership with him, for a harpsichord is noted in the workbooks of Thomas Green of Hertford (<i>fl</i>. 1718&#150;1791), as belonging to Sir Abraham and Lady Hume, of Wormley, Bury, and signed &#145;Jacobus and Abraham Kirckman 1771 fecit&#146;. The atypical use of the English word &#145;and&#146; plus the singular verb &#145;fecit&#146; must give rise to caution when considering the accuracy of Green's reportage. What is certain is that in 1772 several Kirkman harpsichords were signed by the partners &#145;Jacobus et Abraham Kirckman Londini Fecerunt 1772&#146;. It seems that the harpsichord making business was highly successful, and both partners used their money wisely, particularly investing it in property. Unlike his uncle, Abraham appears not to have become a moneylender and, as Jacob grew older and more interested in his other financial activities, Abraham probably became the effective &#145;director&#146; of the firm. By 1790 Jacob had retired to Greenwich, and Abraham most probably took his own son, Joseph, into the firm. A very few harpsichords are signed by Abraham and Joseph, the latest known being dated 1791.<br>
<br>By 1772 Abraham Kirkman had moved, with his family, into 18 Broad Street, Soho, where he was close to his uncle Jacob, who from 1750 had lived at no. 19, while his kinsman, the organist and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15673/', "Jacob Kirkman (d. 1812?)")</script>, lived at no. 20 from 1780. This row of typical London upper working-class houses still exists, though there has been much reparation of bomb damage caused in the Second World War.<br>
<br>Abraham Kirkman died in 1794 at one of his properties at Hammersmith, though probably because he owned a substantial house (called the White House) at Greenwich he was buried at St Alfege, Greenwich, like his uncle Jacob. The church registers record the event simply as &#145;16 April 1794, Abraham Kirkman a Gent&#146;.<br>
<br>The rise of piano making among all the London harpsichord makers in the last quarter of the eighteenth century saw harpsichord building in sharp decline; nevertheless, two harpsichords signed by Abraham's son Joseph dated 1798 and one dated 1800 still exist.<br>
<br>An examination of the 1792 will of Abraham Kirkman shows that at his death his wife was still alive. Three sons are mentioned: Jacob, Joseph, and George Frederick; and five daughters: Charlotte Susannah, who was married to William Wheatley, organist at Greenwich, Harriet, Frances, Ann, and Maria&#151;the last four were under twenty-one at that date. He also owned a copyhold house at Hammersmith (presumably the house where he died), which had outhouses, buildings, a garden, and land near the River Thames. This is probably the building now called Kent House which still stands, and two more houses near to it. His Greenwich property in Crooms Hill (probably the White House) was leased to a Mrs Farr for &pound;150 per annum. In addition there was a further house at Crooms Hill, a leasehold house in Upper Brook Street, another in Compton Street, two in Kennington, Vauxhall, one in King's Row, Grosvenor Street, and others in John Street, Tottenham Court Road, and Peter Street, and an estate in Carmarthen. Despite the amount of property owned by Abraham at his death, it was probably less than half that of his uncle Jacob.<br>
<br>Abraham's wife, Charlotte, died intestate in 1798 at Upper Berkeley Street. The administration of her goods, credits, and chattels was granted to her two sons, named as Joseph and Abraham, on 16 November 1798, by which time the effects were valued at less than &pound;1000.<br>
