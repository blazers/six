<span class="headword">Beecroft,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1854), <span class="occ">west African explorer and consul</span>, was born near Whitby. Little is known about his early years beyond the fact that in 1805, while serving aboard a coasting vessel, he was captured by a French privateer and held prisoner until the peace of 1814. He subsequently joined the merchant service, rising in due course to become commander of a transport vessel, in which capacity he accompanied one of the expeditions to Greenland led by Sir William Parry.<br>
<br>The significant part of Beecroft's career began in 1829 with his appointment as superintendent of works at Fernando Po, an island in the Gulf of Guinea nominally under Spanish control but where Britain was establishing a base for combating the slave trade. Beecroft pressed ahead with building docks and shore installations. Very quickly, however, his superiors recognized his talent for understanding and winning the goodwill of Africans, as when he successfully resolved a dispute with the rulers of Old Calabar, upon which the settlement was largely dependent for provisions. In 1830, when the governor, Edward Nicholls, returned to England on sick leave, Beecroft took over as acting governor, a post conferred on him by the Spanish government with the rank of lieutenant in the Spanish navy, and which he held with distinction for the next two years. Finding that Spain was unwilling to part with Fernando Po, Britain gave up its settlement in 1833. Beecroft, however, stayed on as a partner in the firm of Dillon, Tennant &amp; Co., which controlled the shore establishments from 1833 to 1837. Strictly speaking he was simply a private citizen, but effectively he continued to govern the island, maintaining a court of justice, and generally overseeing its affairs. In 1843 he was made governor of Fernando Po and two other Spanish islands.<br>
<br>Beecroft's other principal concern was using steam power to open up the interior of Africa to trade. The great difficulty was that, although steamers could ascend the Niger and other rivers, the effectiveness of quinine as a prophylactic against malaria had not yet been fully grasped, with the result that the death-rate among Europeans was appallingly high. However, Beecroft's attempts, little noted at the time because they were mounted from Fernando Po, proved much more successful than the highly publicized expeditions that set out from England. Employing crews composed largely of Africans he systematically explored the rivers flowing into the Gulf of Guinea, ascending the Niger as far as Raba, 400 miles from the coast, on more than one occasion. As a result he became the most knowledgeable and influential European in that part of Africa and was continually being called on by traders, missionaries, and humanitarians for advice or to sort out local disputes.<br>
<br>Beecroft was thus already something of an institution when, in 1849, the third Viscount Palmerston appointed him consul to the bights of Benin and Biafra. (This post was not incompatible with his governorship of Fernando Po which he continued to hold until his death.) Although Britain had long had trading connections with these areas, hitherto she had had no territorial ambitions there. Under Beecroft that changed. As the senior resident British official on the coast he was largely responsible for the British occupation of Lagos in 1851 and the deposition of King Pepple of Bonny in 1854. If the years 1829&#150;49 show Beecroft's genius for winning the friendship and respect of Africans, the period 1849&#150;54 reveals him as a forceful interventionist, determined to establish British paramountcy over what was eventually destined to become the colony of Nigeria.<br>
<br>With the support of the British government and of the Royal Geographical Society, to which he had been elected on the recommendation of its president, Sir Roderick Murchison, Beecroft was appointed leader of the Niger expedition in 1854, but before it was fully under way he died, on 10 June 1854 at Fernando Po, where he was buried; his place as leader of the expedition was taken by William Baikie.<br>
