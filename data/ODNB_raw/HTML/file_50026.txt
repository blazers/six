<span class="headword">Fulbourn,  Stephen  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1288), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland and archbishop of Tuam</span>, came from a Cambridgeshire family. A hospitaller, he became precentor and treasurer of the order's priory at Clerkenwell and in 1269 was appointed as his deputy by Roger de Vere, prior of the hospitallers in England. In 1270 the grand master of the order granted Fulbourn the personal use for life of all the property that he had acquired for Clerkenwell or might acquire in the future.<br>
<br>Fulbourn acted as Queen Eleanor's proctor in Ireland in 1270. He was appointed auditor of the tax of a twentieth on moveable property in England in 1273 and receiver of the tallage on the Jews in 1274. Early in 1274 he was elected bishop of Waterford by the dean and chapter at the king's request and on 25 September was appointed treasurer of Ireland, to hold office during the king's pleasure. His appointment and that of Robert of Ufford as justiciar in 1276 were accompanied by measures intended to reform the administration and place control of Irish revenues in the hands of the treasurer. The level of exchequer receipts rose and considerable sums were contributed to Edward I's military activities. In 1281 Fulbourn was responsible for the issuing of a new Irish coinage, much of which was sent abroad for the king's use.<br>
<br>Fulbourn acted as deputy for Ufford, the justiciar, in 1280, and because of Ufford's ill health was himself appointed justiciar on 21 November 1281. He retained the office of treasurer, appointing his brother Walter as his deputy. As justiciar, Fulbourn was confronted with the problem of the Leinster Irish, which he dealt with by removing their leaders. At his instigation, Art Mac Murchadha and his brother Muirchertach were murdered at Arklow in 1282, although they had been received into the king's peace. He subsequently provided legal justification for the murders by taking inquisitions which found the Mac Murchadhas to have been felons. Despite the illegality of his actions, they achieved the desired result. Leinster became relatively peaceful and no major expedition was necessary for the next thirteen years.<br>
<br>Fulbourn used his official position to obtain grants of wardships and lands for himself and preferment for members of his family, whom he appointed to positions in the administration. He antagonized the earl of Norfolk by encroaching on his liberty of Carlow and by furthering the growth of Waterford at the expense of the port of Ross. The aggrandizement of the Fulbourn family gave rise to hostility and envy and led to a series of complaints to the king which came to a head in 1284. The charges included taking bribes, making illicit profits from the mint, customs, and supply of provisions for royal armies in Wales, colluding with the usurpation of royal rights by the archbishop of Armagh, and receiving and paying royal revenues outside the exchequer. Most of the accusations could not be proved, but Fulbourn was discovered to owe the king &pound;33,000, partly because his financial records contained so many alterations and erasures that the auditors refused to allow some sums that he had expended on the king's instructions. His real debt was about &pound;13,000, the result of inefficiency as well as of peculation.<br>
<br>The investigation resulted in a compromise. Fulbourn was replaced as treasurer by Nicholas of Clere, one of his principal accusers, but retained the office of justiciar and was pardoned all but &pound;4000 of his debt to the king because of the great expenses he had incurred on war and defence in Ireland. At Edward's request the pope translated him to the vacant archbishopric of Tuam on 12 July 1286, while a disputed election to the see of Meath in which one of the parties was Walter of Fulbourn was settled by providing Walter to the now vacant see of Waterford in succession to his brother. Attempts at administrative reform after 1285 came to nothing, owing to the ineffectiveness of Fulbourn as justiciar and the general hostility to such measures among members of the administration.<br>
<br>Fulbourn died on 3 July 1288, still in debt to the crown.<br>
