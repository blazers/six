<span class="headword">Simey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Todd]</span>,  Margaret Bayne</span>, Lady Simey  (1906&#150;2004), <span class="occ">social scientist and local politician</span>, was born on 4 January 1906 at Stepps, Cadder, Glasgow, the only daughter in the family of three children of John Aiton Todd, solicitor and educationist, and his wife, Margaret Bayne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turnbull. When she was young the family moved to London, where she attended St Paul's Girls' School. At eighteen she moved with her family to Liverpool when her father became head of the College of Commerce in Tithebarn Street. She had never felt at home in London, but something &#145;clicked into place&#146;, she said, when she moved to Liverpool  (personal knowledge). In 1928 she became Liverpool University's first female social science graduate. In her formative years she fell much under the influence of Eleanor Rathbone, the first woman to be elected to Liverpool city council and later independent MP for the Combined English Universities. The settlement movement and the girls' clubs at this time made her a passionate advocate of civil society. Much of what she later wrote&#151;from her first book, <span class="italic">Charitable Effort in Liverpool</span> (1951)&#151;was about how voluntary effort bound together individuals and communities and sustained democracy. Indeed in <span class="italic">The Disinherited Society: a Personal View of Social Responsibility in Liverpool During the Twentieth Century</span> (1996) she wrote: &#145;I am my own visual aid&#146;  (p. 8), signifying a lifetime intertwined with Liverpool's fortunes, politics, and organizations.<br>
<br>On 12 April 1935 Margaret married Thomas Simey [<i>see below</i>], a lecturer in public administration at Liverpool University. They had one son, (Thomas) Iliff Simey (<i>b</i>. 1938), who became an award-winning architect. The family spent most of the war years, from 1941 to 1945, in the Caribbean, as part of a small team of experts advising on social and economic development. Margaret and Tom Simey later collaborated on a biography of the Liverpool philanthropist and shipowner, Charles Booth (1960).<br>
<br>In 1963 Margaret Simey was elected as Labour member for the Granby ward of Liverpool city council. She represented the same area after 1974 when the Merseyside metropolitan council was created. In 1981 she was elected chairperson of the Merseyside police authority at a time when deepening social and economic problems were affecting the poorest areas, and when the anger of those whom she represented was reaching boiling point. At the height of the Toxteth riots that year she said that if she was unemployed and black, she, too, would be rioting, and that her constituents would be apathetic if they didn't protest. These statements brought criticism from Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister, and much of the press, some of it abusive. For a time she became a hate-figure in the Conservative Party. This did not, however, dissuade her. Her criticisms of police methods, as well as her belief that the police had to be accountable to democratically elected representatives, caused a serious rupture with Kenneth Oxford, the chief constable, whom she tried unsuccessfully to have removed. She again reached national prominence during the miners' strike of 1984&#150;5 when the police authority threatened to take Oxford to court to stop him sending reinforcements to the affected areas.<br>
<br>In 1986 Simey retired as a councillor but she continued working with the voluntary sector and travelled long distances as a much sought-after conference speaker. She also continued to write, among her books being <span class="italic">Democracy Rediscovered: a Study in Police Accountability</span> (1988). In old age she received an honorary doctorate from Liverpool University, which also made her an honorary senior fellow, a post she took seriously. When she became too incapacitated to leave her tall, handsome, but rickety Georgian house, the university sent students to her for tutorials. She was offered the freedom of the city of Liverpool but declined it.<br>
<br>Simey disliked paternalism whether by Liverpool city council, Michael Heseltine, the Conservative environment secretary in the 1980s, or New Labour after 1997. In her latter years, when she turned her activity partly to housing associations, she found the same faults she found elsewhere: professionalization, managerialism, and a distancing from people. She saw the decline in industry, unemployment, increasing poverty, and official paternalism as loosening the bonds of community. When her son spent several years as a community worker in Lesotho she visited him and found there evidence of what post-industrial societies were losing: mutuality.<br>
<br>Simey was possessed of great physical and emotional energy. She was noticeable by her tall, angular build, topped in later years by a bun of silver hair. She took pride in being &#145;a thoroughly awkward customer&#146;&#151;a criticism once made of her. She always spoke of Liverpool and its citizens as &#145;us&#146;&#151;if their voice was not listened to, then neither was hers. The big problem, she said once, was not unemployment, race, or the police&#151;it was &#145;us&#146; not being listened to. In old age she railed also against her exclusion and that of her contemporaries from a society which she believed had no use for old people. Her spirit remained unquenched. When she was ninety she told an audience how Charles Booth, in his guise as shipowner, counselled his passengers to avoid sea sickness by keeping their eyes on the horizon. It was on that distant (but, to her, reachable) point that her sharp, blue eyes were for so long focused. She died on 27 July 2004 of pneumonia and heart disease at Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, and was survived by her son, Iliff. On 15 September a celebration of her life was held, following which her ashes were spread on the River Mersey from the ferry boat she had fought to save. <span class="italic">From Rhetoric to Reality</span>, her study of the life and work of Frederic D'Aeth, the founding lecturer in social science at Liverpool University, was published posthumously in 2005.<br>
<br>Margaret Simey's husband, <a name="cosubject_98088"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Spensley <span class="st"> [Tom]</span> Simey</span>, Baron Simey  (1906&#150;1969), <span class="occ">social scientist</span>, was born on 25 November 1906 at South Hill, Greenway Lane, Lyncombe, Somerset, the third son of George Iliff Simey (1866&#150;1927), solicitor, and clerk of the peace and of Somerset county council from 1905 to 1927, and his wife, Alice Robson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spensley (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of the Revd William Spensley, of Belle Vue House, Sunderland. He was educated privately, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1928. He then worked in local government, and qualified as a solicitor in 1931. In the latter year he was appointed a lecturer in public administration at the University of Liverpool. His <span class="italic">Principles of Social Administration</span> was published in 1937. In 1939 he succeeded Alexander Carr-Sounders as Charles Booth professor of social science at Liverpool, a post he held until his death. During the early part of the Second World War he worked for the Ministry of Labour on manpower issues. His Caribbean experience led to <span class="italic">Welfare and Planning in the West Indies</span> (1946). After the war he built up Liverpool's department of social sciences, which combined a national reputation for training social workers with an international reputation for its research, particularly in the fields of industrial relations and community development. Among Simey's own later works was <span class="italic">Social Science and Social Purpose</span> (1968). He was chairman of the Joint University Council for Social Studies (1948&#150;51), the British Sociological Association (1949&#150;50), and the central advisory committee of the Ministry of Education (1956&#150;60), and president of the National Federation of Community Associations (1961&#150;4). He was also a governor of William Temple College (1948&#150;67) and a director of Liverpool Repertory Theatre (1947&#150;69). He was created a life peer, as Baron Simey, of Toxteth, in 1965. He died of apoplexy and hypertension at Lourdes Hospital, Sefton Park, Liverpool, on 27 December 1969.<br>
