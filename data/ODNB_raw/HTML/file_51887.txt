<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gerhard,  Roberto Juan Rene</span>  (1896&#150;1970), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 25 September 1896 in Valls, Catalonia, Spain, son of a Swiss-German father, a wine merchant by trade, and a French mother. His teenage years were spent in Germany and in Switzerland, where in 1908 he embarked on training for a career in commerce at the school in Zofingen at the insistence of his parents. He transferred to Neuch&acirc;tel three years later, but by 1913 he had switched to studying music with the Lausanne-based musician Hugo Strauss. At the outbreak of the First World War he was studying the piano at the Munich Academy and taking private composition lessons from Walter Courvoisier. Gerhard returned to the Catalonian capital of Barcelona in 1914 and continued his studies with his eminent countrymen Enrique Granados and Felipe Pedrell. In 1923 he was accepted as a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg, with whom he studied first in Vienna and then at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin.<br>
<br>Despite such an international approach to his academic studies, Gerhard was deeply committed to retaining, promoting, and developing a distinctive Catalan cultural identity. He returned to Barcelona in 1929 and in the following year married Leopoldina (Poldi) Fiechtegger (<i>d</i>. 1994), whom he had met in Vienna. In 1931 he was appointed professor of music at the Escola Normal de la Generalitat, Barcelona. By this time he was already a significant figure in the cultural life of Catalonia, promoting the works of Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Hanns Eisler, with his own compositions promoted by the Associacio de Musica Catalana and a number of articles and translations published. His interests ranged across the arts, and in 1932 he co-founded the organization Amics de l'Art Nou (Friends of New Art) with Salvador Dal&iacute;, Lluis Montanya, and Sebastia Gasch. Gerhard was then appointed head of the music section at the Biblioteca de Catalunya in Barcelona, where he edited works by the eighteenth-century Spanish composers V. M. y Soler and D. M. B. Terradellas. From 1937 to 1938 he was adviser to the ministry of fine arts in the Catalan government and on the Central Musical Council of the republican government. The defeat of the republicans in 1938, while Gerhard was in Warsaw as a member of the jury of the International Society of Contemporary Music, precipitated his life as an &eacute;migr&eacute;. He did not return home but instead took refuge with the painter Joan Mir&oacute; (with whom he had collaborated on the ballet <span class="italic">Ariel</span> in 1934) and Josep Lluis Sert in Paris. In 1939 Gerhard secured a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge, thanks to the intervention of Professor Edward J. Dent. He subsequently made Cambridge his permanent home, accepting British citizenship in 1960.<br>
<br>Even after the move to Cambridge, Gerhard's works remained overtly nationalistic, being infused with Iberian folk melodies and rhythms; but his wider European experience had brought him into contact with serial techniques, and it is the fluctuation between Mediterranean ebullience and German tradition that makes them so distinctive. Neither of these qualities endeared him to the conservative musical establishment of Britain in the decade following the Second World War. The remarkable dodecaphonic operetta <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (1945&#150;7), which was not staged until 1992, and the ballet <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1947&#150;9) mark the peak of this nationalist period, after which his music became increasingly concerned with the abstract potential of sound. Described by the composer&#150;conductor Antal Dorati as &#145;a very shy, retiring, modest man&#146;, Gerhard stayed on the periphery of Cambridge academic life, earning his income mainly through writing incidental music for thirty-eight theatre, radio, and television productions. In 1943 he also made several arrangements of popular Spanish music at the behest of the BBC Theatre Orchestra under the pseudonym Juan Serrallonga (the name of a seventeenth-century Catalan fighter against Castilian oppression).<br>
<br>Gerhard was an avid collector of sounds on tape and was described in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> as &#145;a connoisseur of unfamiliar, delicious and unexpected sounds&#146;. This talent, combined with his literary interests, produced spectacularly atmospheric scores for works by authors and playwrights as varied as Salvador de Madariaga, Cervantes, Albert Camus, Shakespeare, J. B. Priestley, Jean Rhys, Schiller, Wyndham Lewis, Lorca, Chekhov, Gogol, Hoffmansthal, Robert Graves, Hemingway, and Dorothy L. Sayers. Gerhard had met Edgar Var&egrave;se, the American pioneer of electronic music, in Catalonia in 1933. Working in a tiny studio in his new home in Cambridge, Gerhard became one of the first composers in Britain to experiment with taped sounds. In 1955 he composed an electronic score for Peter Brook's staging of <span class="italic">King Lear</span> in Stratford which no doubt contributed to the notoriety of this production. That he is not better known may perhaps be because such a significant proportion of his work is incidental music and therefore remains unpublished.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Gerhard began to benefit from a decision by Sir William Glock, head of the Third Programme, to extend the patronage of the BBC to commissions for concert works. In an obituary of Gerhard, Glock stated:<blockquote>At present we are apt to seize on the high ratio of brilliance and sheer impetuous movement in his works, and on his instrumental mastery. The other qualities&#151;of nobility, restraint, of a poetry which rejects any borrowed world of emotion and is itself severely disciplined in every chord, every progression&#151;will grow on us. And perhaps the brilliance itself will be more deeply understood. (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>)</blockquote>The freedom to try out new techniques of structure and orchestration in the incidental scores undoubtedly informed Gerhard's concert works, which develop groups of characteristic intervals into contrasting textural episodes. His music was criticized by contemporary critics for its lack of motivic development and for being merely a succession of cleverly balanced aural events. Perhaps this opinion is valid in some of the larger-scale orchestral works: the first two of the four symphonies, <span class="italic">Epithalamion</span>, and the concerto for piano. What is so striking and perturbing about Gerhard's compositions, however, is his ability to create radical sonic structures using serial means.<blockquote>Of all the atonal composers of stature, Roberto Gerhard &hellip; is the most likely to disarm the listener suspicious of serial techniques. His music has two characteristics immediately attractive to any audience&#151;incisive wit and propulsive rhythmic drive, qualities either lacking in the works of the great Viennese atonalists or else so deeply embedded as to be imperceptible to the average listener. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>)</blockquote>Where this fusion of means undoubtedly works is in the single-movement compositions <span class="italic">Nonet</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Concert for Eight</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Hymnody</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">Concerto for Orchestra</span> (1965) and the three &#145;horoscope&#146; pieces <span class="italic">Gemini</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Libra</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">Leo</span> (1969). Such innovative works still reveal their Catalan roots, however, with allusions to flamenco rhythms and guitar strumming. Most haunting, however, is the simple and beautiful folk-like clarinet tune that closes <span class="italic">Leo</span>, significantly named after Gerhard's own zodiacal sign and his last completed composition.<br>
<br>Gerhard was invited to the United States of America twice: in 1960 as visiting professor of composition at the University of Michigan, where he wrote his symphony no. 3 (<span class="italic">Collages</span>), and in 1961 as composition tutor at the Berkshire Music Center, Tanglewood, Massachusetts. He was made a CBE in 1967 and was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by the University of Cambridge and a fellowship of University College, London, in 1968. He died at his Cambridge home, 14 Madingley Road, on 5 January 1970.<br>
<br>A revival of nationalist interest in Catalonia in the post-Franco era and the opportunity for promoters to highlight Gerhard's music in the centenary year of his birth in 1996 has led to increased recognition and critical acclaim, as foretold by Sir William Glock. In 1992 <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> received a triumphant stage premi&egrave;re at the Teatro L&iacute;rico Nacional in Madrid, at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, and subsequently on tour in the UK with the British company Opera North, all conducted by Antoni Ros Marb&agrave;. Many of the concert works are now available on quality commercial recordings, and the chamber pieces, especially the &#145;horoscope&#146; trilogy, are in the repertory of many of the specialist contemporary music ensembles in Europe.<br>
<br>Gerhard's posthumous reputation is that of a composer who successfully wove together fragmenting elements of twentieth-century musical styles&#151;nationalism, electronic music, new formal structures, new instrumentations&#151;without ever resorting to the &#145;mix and match&#146; of post-modernism. The music, like the composer's life, is eclectic and quixotic but drawn together by a vigorous intellectual coherence and integrity.<br>
