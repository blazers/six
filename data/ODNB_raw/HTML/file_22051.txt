<span class="headword">Petrie,  George</span>  (1790&#150;1866), <span class="occ">antiquary and painter</span>, was born in Dublin on 1 January 1790, the only child of James Petrie, a portrait painter. His mother was a daughter of Sacheverel Simpson of Edinburgh. His paternal grandfather, also named James, had moved from Aberdeen to settle in Ireland. In 1799 Petrie was sent to Samuel Whyte's school in Dublin. From childhood he helped his father to paint miniatures, and he attended the art school of the Dublin Society. Before he was fourteen he was awarded the society's silver medal for drawing a group of figures. He early became interested in Irish antiquities, and in 1808 travelled round co. Wicklow, making notes of Irish music, ecclesiastical architecture, and ancient earthworks and pillar-stones. In 1810 he visited Wales, where he made landscape sketches, and in 1813 he visited London, where he was kindly treated by Benjamin West, to whom he had an introduction.<br>
<br>After his return to Ireland, Petrie painted landscapes, mainly in Dublin, co. Wicklow, co. Kildare, the King's county, and co. Kerry; in 1816 he exhibited at Somerset House pictures of Glendalough and Glenmalure, both in co. Wicklow. In 1820 he contributed illustrations to a number of guidebooks on Ireland. At the first exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1826, Petrie exhibited a large picture of Ardfinane, a castle standing above a many-arched bridge on the north bank of the Suir. The next year he exhibited <span class="italic">The Round Tower of Kilbannon</span>, co. Galway, and <span class="italic">Dun Aengus</span>, a great cashel in Aranmor, co. Galway. He was elected an academician in 1828, and exhibited <span class="italic">The Twelve Pins in Connemara</span> and <span class="italic">The Last Round of the Pilgrims at Clonmacnoise</span>. In 1829 he painted <span class="italic">The Knight and the Lady</span> and <span class="italic">Culdean Abbey</span>. He was appointed librarian to the Hibernian Academy in 1830, and exhibited six pictures that year and nine in 1831. In the course of his studies for these works he made many tours throughout Ireland, travelled along the whole course of the Shannon, and explored Clonmacnoise, Cong, Kilfenora, the Aran Islands, and many other ecclesiastical ruins.<br>
<br>When Caesar Otway (1780&#150;1842) began the <span class="italic">Dublin Penny Journal</span> in June 1832, Petrie joined him, and wrote many antiquarian articles in the fifty-six weekly numbers that appeared. He was also the sole editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Penny Journal</span>, which appeared for a year in 1842. Its aim was to describe to the Irish people the importance of their history and antiquities, their legends and traditions. John O'Donovan was a fellow contributor. Petrie joined the Royal Irish Academy in 1828, was elected onto its council in 1829, and worked hard to improve its museum and library. In 1831 he discovered and purchased the autograph copy of the second part of the &#145;Annals of the kingdom of Ireland&#146;, called by John Colgan the annals of the four masters. For the academy's museum he bought the cross of Cong, the Ardagh Chalice, and some torcs from Tara. Petrie's work on the collection made the museum a centre for the study of Ireland's past. The pieces he purchased now form the nucleus of the National Museum of Ireland.<br>
<br>From 1833 to 1846 Petrie worked for the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. Here his assistants were John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry. After O'Donovan, Petrie was the member of the staff who did most to preserve local history and historical topography through the publication of memoirs to accompany the maps. His work on Tara, written in 1837, was published by the Royal Irish Academy. The first memoir of the survey on Londonderry appeared in 1839. Here Petrie, who was a Catholic and a nationalist, charged the early Scottish settlers with fanaticism, and suggested that since the union the cultural life of the area had deteriorated. An anonymous letter to Dublin Castle accused him of prejudice and of wasting money by devoting too much time to investigating the ancestry of the peasantry.<br>
<br>The government soon after decided to stop the survey on the grounds of expense. A commission appointed in 1843 recommended its continuance, after examining Petrie and other witnesses, but it was never resumed. The Royal Irish Academy awarded Petrie a gold medal for his essay on Tara. Sir William Betham (1779&#150;1853), the Ulster king of arms, whose theories on Irish antiquities had been demolished by Petrie, fiercely opposed the award and resigned his seat on the council. In 1833 Petrie was awarded a gold medal for an &#145;Essay on the origin and uses of the round towers of Ireland&#146;, which was later published as <span class="italic">The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</span> (1845). The round towers in Ireland&#151;of which there are approximately 120&#151;had been variously (and sometimes comically) identified by other scholars as Phoenician fire-temples, sorcerers' towers, astronomical observatories, centres for religious dances, temples of Vesta, minarets for proclaiming anniversaries, Danish watch-towers, tombs, gnomons, homes of Persian magi, and phallic emblems. Petrie put paid to all these theories, showing that the towers were Christian ecclesiastical buildings of varying dates. His evidence was abundant and well presented, and although modern research has refined his theory&#151;suggesting that the towers date from the period of the viking raids and may have served a defensive purpose (although attached to ecclesiastical establishments)&#151;the substance of his findings is established scholarly opinion.<br>
<br>Petrie also wrote numerous papers on Irish art, mainly careful descriptions of various antiquities. He also made a collection of Irish inscriptions, which was edited after his death, with additions, by Margaret Stokes, under the title of <span class="italic">Christian Inscriptions in the Irish Language</span>. In 1816 he wrote an &#145;Essay on music&#146; in the <span class="italic">Dublin Examiner</span>: a devotee of Irish music, he collected airs wherever he travelled, and learned to play them on his violin. In 1855 he published <span class="italic">The Ancient Music of Ireland</span>, a collection of songs and airs made in all parts of Ireland. In the introduction he lamented the loss of a national memory of the past, the result of successive disasters, death, and emigration.<br>
<br>Petrie received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Dublin in 1847, and in 1849 was given a civil-list pension. He continued to tour Ireland in his later years; in 1857 he again visited the Isles of Aran, and in the autumn of 1864 he made his last journey to the one region he had never seen, the Old Glen in the parish of Glencolumkille in Donegal. Petrie, who was married to a Miss Mills, died at his house at 7 Charlemont Place, Dublin, on 17 January 1866, and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. He was survived by at least one daughter. A disinterested student of medieval Irish architecture, decorative art, music, and topography all his life, he made permanent and important contributions in these fields, and, tangentially, in others. His work in tracing and illustrating Irish decorated churches from the seventh century was, for example, extremely influential on the designs of church architects in nineteenth-century Ireland. His sole object was the advancement of his research: he gave generous help to many other scholars, and attracted a large circle of friends.<br>
