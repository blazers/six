<span class="headword">Congreve, Sir  Walter Norris</span>  (1862&#150;1927), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Chatham on 20 November 1862, the eldest son of Captain William Congreve JP DL of Congreve Manor, Staffordshire, and his wife, Fanny Porcher Townshend, of Wincham Hall, Cheshire. Congreve's father was a regular soldier in the 9th and 29th foot, who later became chief constable of Staffordshire. Among Congreve's military ancestors were two distinguished eighteenth-century artillerymen, Lieutenant-General Sir William Congreve, and his namesake, who developed the Congreve rocket.<br>
<br>Walter Congreve was educated at Harrow School and Pembroke College, Oxford, matriculating in 1881 but leaving without graduating after apparently wounding a senior member of the college with an air rifle. Congreve had been commissioned in the North Staffordshire militia and, in 1883, resolved to enter the regular army. Passing through the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he shared rooms with Douglas Haig, Congreve was commissioned into the rifle brigade as lieutenant on 7 February 1885. Congreve served with the 4th battalion in India and, on returning with it to England in 1889, he became assistant adjutant for musketry. On 3 June 1890 he married Cecilia Henrietta Dolores Blount La Touche, the daughter of Charles Blount La Touche, a captain in the Bombay army. Congreve's work on musketry brought him some recognition and he was promoted to captain on 6 December 1893. After further regimental service in India and England, he was appointed district inspector of musketry at Aldershot on 1 January 1898.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the South African War, Congreve was appointed to the 4th brigade staff, but was then attached to the headquarters of General Sir Redvers Buller as press censor. On 15 December 1899, during Buller's attempt to force the Tugela River at Colenso, Colonel Charles Long's artillery brigade advanced within close range of Boer riflemen and came under sustained, heavy fire. Buller called for volunteers from his own staff to help rescue the twelve guns abandoned in the open by their surviving crews. Congreve volunteered together with two aides-de-camp, Captain H. N. Schofield and Lieutenant Frederick (Freddy) Roberts, only son of Field Marshal Lord Roberts VC.<br>
<br>Galloping forward with two limbers over half a mile of open plain, Congreve was hit in his right leg, with other bullets passing through his clothing, and thrown when his horse was killed. After lying in a hollow for several hours without water under a sun &#145;which I have never felt hotter even in India&#146;  (Congreve diary, priv. coll., 15 Dec 1899), Congreve managed to bring in the mortally wounded Roberts. Taken prisoner by the Boers, the wounded were released after their equipment was removed. For his gallantry, Congreve was awarded the Victoria Cross as were three others, including a posthumous award for Freddy Roberts. Subsequently, Congreve's eldest son, William, killed on the Somme in July 1916, was also awarded the VC. There have been only three cases of the VC being awarded to both father and son: Roberts, Congreve, and Sir Charles and John Gough.<br>
<br>After recovering from his wound, Congreve briefly joined the irregular corps, Kitchener's horse, as adjutant before becoming brigade major of 18th infantry brigade in March 1900 and seeing action at Poplar Grove and Driefontein in the advance upon Bloemfontein. In November 1900 Congreve became, first, deputy assistant adjutant-general and, then, assistant military secretary at headquarters under Roberts and his successor, Lord Kitchener. Promoted to a regimental majority on 12 December 1901, Congreve received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy for his war services in December 1901. In November 1902 he joined the personal staff of the duke of Connaught, commanding in Ireland, receiving the MVO in 1903 and accompanying Connaught as private secretary in May 1904 when the duke was appointed inspector-general to the forces.<br>
<br>Receiving his brevet colonelcy in June 1905, Congreve returned to regimental duty. Promoted to substantive colonel in July 1908, Congreve remained on half pay until appointed to command the school of musketry at Hythe in September 1909. In December 1911 Congreve, now a CB, took command of 18th infantry brigade with rank of brigadier-general, though troubled by frequent asthma attacks. In March 1914 he was one of many officers who supported Hubert and John Gough at the time of the Curragh incident. With the outbreak of the First World War, Congreve took his brigade to France in September 1914, commanding it on the Aisne and then at First Ypres. Promoted to major-general on 18 February 1915, Congreve remained with his brigade until taking over command of 6th division in May 1915. His division did not see any major action before Congreve was selected to command the new 13th corps in November 1915, receiving the rank of temporary lieutenant-general in June 1917.<br>
<br>A man of great physical and moral courage, it became quickly apparent that Congreve was supremely a fighting general, incurring great risks in visiting the front line. As a subordinate later put it, Congreve was &#145;a most adventurous man &hellip; and infinitely preferred walking out in full view and quite close to the enemy than anything else. He simply asked for trouble&#146;  (Stanley, 112&#150;13). Indeed, Congreve was the only corps commander wounded during the war, having his left hand shattered by a shell while visiting his artillery near Vimy Ridge in June 1917: in his typically laconic style, he simply recorded of the event, &#145;A shell came down &amp; cut off my left hand all but some bits&#146;  (Congreve diary, 12 June 1917). The hand was amputated.<br>
<br>As a corps commander, however, Congreve had mixed fortunes. With many practical qualities and great personal charm, he was not a deeply read or scientific soldier despite his university education. Allotted to Sir Henry Rawlinson's Fourth Army in the spring of 1916, Congreve was not regarded as &#145;dashing enough&#146; by Rawlinson  (Congreve diary, 5 April 1916) when he objected to the initial operational plan for the Somme. As a result, Sir Henry Horne's 15th corps took the major role on 1 July 1916, with two of Congreve's five divisions taken from his direct control. Ironically, it was 13th corps, operating on the extreme right of the British advance in co-operation with the French, which enjoyed the greatest success on that otherwise disastrous day, reaching the Montauban Ridge. Congreve complained to Haig, in whom he had little confidence, about his treatment. Generally, Congreve found Haig disingenuous in his dealings with him, though the official historian, Sir James Edmonds, later claimed that Haig had always shrunk from dismissing corps commanders like Congreve whom he believed inefficient. Congreve was then entrusted, however, with the innovative night attack by the Fourth Army on 14 July and, indeed, appears to have been the originator of the operational concept. The death of his son William on 20 July was a grievous blow, and Congreve succumbed to cholera nostras on 10 August, returning to his command only in late September.<br>
<br>Transferred to Hubert Gough's Fifth Army, Congreve commanded 13th corps during the actions around Arras in the spring of 1917. He found Gough more congenial than Rawlinson and, in turn, Gough admired Congreve's qualities:<blockquote>Very spare and lightly built, a frame giving evidence of the fragility of his constitution, a firm and very English countenance, with an indomitable and courageous will, a character which could remain outwardly unmoved at times of great personal sorrow or of immense responsibility and danger, an energy which made him active of body in spite of ill-health, there were few generals in the British Army who surpassed him as a commander. (Gough, 151)</blockquote>Following the loss of his hand, Congreve, who in 1917 was created KCB for his services, returned to the Fifth Army to command 7th corps as a substantive lieutenant-general on 1 January 1918. Congreve's corps took the full brunt of the major German offensive on 21 March 1918. His decision to defend the front line strongly rather than deploy in depth cost 7th corps heavy casualties from the outset. Under mounting German pressure, Congreve's position was further undermined by the withdrawal of the Third Army from the Flesqui&egrave;res salient on his left, opening a crucial gap between 7th and 5th corps. Under a German aerial bombing attack on his headquarters, Congreve had continued to dine, unmoved by the explosions. Always in fragile health from his frequent bronchial attacks, however, and never having fully recovered from the loss of his son, Congreve was clearly stretched to the limits of his mental and physical endurance during the offensive. The strain was evinced by Congreve's contradictory orders to 16th division on 26 March, which led to its collapse, and the removal of Major-General Franks from command of 35th division on the same day for refusing what would have been a disastrous attempt to reoccupy the line of the Ancre, which had already been abandoned.<br>
<br>Gough was removed from command of the Fifth Army on 7 April and, on the same day, Congreve was transferred to command 10th corps, then resting behind the lines. Then, on 15 May, he was ordered home, Haig refusing to see him. Subsequently, Congreve was one of the more vociferous of Gough's friends in urging him to defend the reputation of the Fifth Army.<br>
<br>Congreve remained on half pay until August 1919, when he was sent to command British forces at Haifa, taking over the command of all British forces in Egypt and Palestine on 14 October 1919. It was a period of unrest in the Middle East and, displaying the casual antisemitic views of many of his colleagues, Congreve feared Zionist influence in the region. It might be added that Congreve was also greatly prejudiced against socialists and Irish nationalists and cheerfully professed to disliking Arabs, Jews and Syrian Christians equally: &#145;they are all alike, a beastly people, the whole lot of them not worth one Englishman&#146;  (Congreve to Wilson, 1 April 1920, Wilson MSS, HHW 2/52A/16). None the less, Congreve's command was judged a success and, much as he disliked Palestine, he was sorry to leave an Egyptian climate that suited him. Promoted to general on 25 November 1922, &#145;Squib&#146; Congreve, as he was known to Henry Wilson, returned to southern command at Salisbury in April 1923 and was appointed aide-de-camp to the king in March 1924. Congreve had also become colonel commandant of the 1st battalion, rifle brigade, in 1922, as well as an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford. A fearless horseman, though he gave up hunting as a result of a growing distaste for blood sports, Congreve was very much a countryman. He derived much pleasure, therefore, from his appointments as both JP and deputy lieutenant of Staffordshire.<br>
<br>Despite his failing health, Congreve accepted the governorship of Malta in June 1924. He proved a popular governor, dying at the military hospital, Imtarfa, Valletta, on 28 February 1927. He was buried at sea between Malta and Gozo, in what is now called the Congreve Strait. It had been intended to give Congreve a baronetcy at the time of his death, and this was awarded to the second of his three sons, Geoffrey, in 1927.<br>
