<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Groves, Sir  Charles Barnard</span>  (1915&#150;1992), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born on 10 March 1915 at 52 Park Hall Road, London, the only child of Frederick Groves and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitehead. His father, who had been invalided out of the trenches during the First World War, died when Groves was only six. His mother died four years later, and Groves was made a ward of court. His musical education began when he was sent to St Paul's Cathedral choir school as a chorister. Later he attended Sutton Valence School in Kent. He showed exceptional promise and entered the Royal College of Music (of which he was to become a fellow), where he studied piano and organ. In 1937, at the age of twenty-two, he accompanied the choral rehearsals for Toscanini's broadcast performance of Brahms's <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, an achievement which led to his appointment as chorus master of the BBC opera unit. He then graduated via the BBC Theatre Orchestra and the BBC Revue Orchestra to the conductorship of the Manchester-based BBC Northern (later Philharmonic) Orchestra, a post he held from 1944 until 1951. During this period, because he was in charge of a broadcasting orchestra, he began to acquire an exceptionally large repertory. It was in Manchester, in 1948, that he met and married a BBC colleague, Hilary Barchard. There were three children, Sally, Mary and Jonathan, the first and last of whom were to pursue careers in music.<br>
<br>Success with the BBC Northern Orchestra brought Groves an invitation from Bournemouth corporation to become their director of music and conductor of the municipal orchestra. He made the move in 1951, and the orchestra was renamed the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 1954. During nearly ten years he greatly enhanced the standards and standing of the orchestra, and he played a large part in saving the orchestra from disbandment following the corporation's withdrawal of its grant. He moved in 1961 to Cardiff, where he took up the post of resident music director of the Welsh National Opera. Once again he contributed to the strong development of a company with high ideals and ever-expanding achievement. His own versatility was apparent in fine performances of <span class="italic">Figaro</span>, <span class="italic">William Tell</span>, and <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span>.<br>
<br>Groves was now formidably well equipped, and it was not surprising that he was engaged by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, whose music director and resident conductor he was from 1963 to 1977. This period was the apex of his career. He made his home in Liverpool and committed himself wholeheartedly to the city's orchestra. It was a time when funding&#151;never lavish&#151;was at least adequate. As a consequence he was able to undertake grandiose projects&#151;a complete Mahler cycle, Messiaen's <span class="italic">Turangal&icirc;la-symphonie</span>, and Berlioz's <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> (complete with twelve harps) at the opening of Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral. He was a generous champion of living British composers, performing works by more than twenty of them, and he found space for some of the international figures, including Lutos&#322;awski, Henze, and Berio. Among a number of his innovations was a series of seminars for young conductors in which Andrew Davis, Mark Elder, and John Eliot Gardiner took part. On one such occasion Groves noted the presence in his orchestra, as an extra percussion player, of a young teenager named Simon Rattle. When he left Liverpool in 1977 he bequeathed to his successor an orchestra of character and quality; it had some important recordings&#151;Delius, Elgar, and Walton in particular&#151;to its credit. But the invitation, from Lord Harewood, to join the English National Opera as music director was one he should perhaps have declined: he was over sixty, and he found the stress of combining administration with conducting too much for him. He resigned after two seasons.<br>
<br>Groves was in constant demand on the concert platform. In 1975 he had toured Japan with Pierre Boulez and the BBC Symphony Orchestra and, as a result of this, he was regularly invited to Tokyo, to which city he introduced Delius's <span class="italic">A Mass of Life</span>, one of his very finest interpretations. He toured extensively in Australasia and Latin America as well as Europe, invariably presenting British music. At home, in 1984, he joined the English Sinfonia as president and artistic adviser, later also becoming principal conductor of the Guildford Philharmonic (1987) and music director of the Leeds Philharmonic Society (1988).<br>
<br>A respected figure in the music profession, Groves was generous with his time and experience where honorary commitments were concerned. He was president of the Incorporated Society of Musicians in 1972 and again in 1982, president of the National Federation of Music Societies from 1972 to 1980, and president of the National Youth Orchestra from 1977 to 1992, and was elected an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1990. He was honoured by the conservatoires: as companion of the Royal Northern College of Music (whose council he chaired from 1973 to 1990), as fellow of the Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Trinity College of Music, and London College of Music, and as an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music. Passionately concerned with the welfare of musicians, he was prominent on the picket line outside Broadcasting House during the musicians' strike against the BBC in 1980. When it was over he gallantly agreed to &#145;mind&#146; the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra until permanent arrangements could be agreed. Appointed OBE in 1958 and CBE in 1968, he was knighted in 1973. He received doctorates from Liverpool, Salford, and Surrey universities, as well as from the Open University, and he was a fellow of the polytechnics of Liverpool and Manchester. He was made a freeman of the City of London in 1976.<br>
<br>Despite his status, his experience, and the respect which he commanded, despite also his firm Christian faith, Groves remained, privately, a man who constantly questioned his own standards. Fastidious in his preparation of even the most undemanding of concerts and a superb accompanist, he often suffered from a fear that he might let his colleagues down. It was a needless fear, but a real one, and there were indeed times when overwork, or nervousness, or some absence of the fire of conviction resulted in lacklustre performances. But when he was completely confident his work was compelling and authoritative. In the mould of Wood or Boult, rather than Beecham or Barbirolli, he shared with the first two a profound sense of duty towards British, and particularly living British, composers. Overseas he performed music by Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Delius, Britten, Walton, Tippett, Goehr, and Musgrave. His premi&egrave;res included works by Lennox Berkeley, David Blake, Gordon Crosse, Jonathan Harvey, Robin Holloway, Daniel Jones, John McCabe, Edmund Rubbra, Edwin Roxburgh, Giles Swayne, Priaulx Rainier, and Hugh Wood. He recorded music by Arnold, Butterworth, Bliss, Bridge, Maxwell Davies, Hoddinott, Mathias, Grace Williams, and Williamson, among others. He was an admirable ambassador for British music.<br>
<br>In person Groves was a reassuring figure: his straight back, firm bearded chin, and stocky build inspired confidence, despite his own self-doubts. His marriage was exceptionally happy and his Anglican faith was a constant source of strength. He was working when he suffered a heart attack early in 1992, and he died in London on 20 June 1992. There is a memorial stone to his memory in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
