<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke, Sir  (Ernest George) Stenson</span>  (1874&#150;1942), <span class="occ">secretary of the Automobile Association and fencer</span>, was born Ernest George Cooke at 9 Shrubland Road, Haggerstone, London, on 5 October 1874, the second of the three children of Silas Cooke (1850&#150;1925), a clerk who worked in a stationer's business and who later became a dealer in wine, and his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walsh (1852&#150;1894). Following his mother's death his father married Lizzie Frances Christmas (<i>b</i>. 1872).<br>
<br>Cooke's early life was &#145;obscure&#146;  (Barty-King, 67), though the family is known to have lived in City Road and Finsbury Square, London. He claimed to be privately educated, and left school, possibly in Yorkshire, aged about fourteen. He then &#145;entered the world of commerce&#146; in London, and may have worked for a time as a clerk on the stock exchange  (<span class="italic">Sporting Life</span>, 2 July 1918). At the time of his marriage he termed himself a &#145;wine merchant&#146; (m. cert; census returns, 1901), though he may have been more a &#145;wine and spirits traveller&#146;  (Barty-King, 75). There is no evidence that the name Stenson, by which Cooke was known throughout his life as a public figure, was conferred by anyone but himself in adolescence. He had adopted it by the time of his marriage, on 20 June 1899, to (Sara) May Harriett Brooke (1876&#150;1961), daughter of Charles Edward Brooke, provision merchant. They lived in Fulham, then Muswell Hill and at Stockleigh Hall, Regent's Park, and had a son, Ernest Stenson jun. (<i>b</i>. 1900), and a daughter, Joyce (Joy) (<i>b</i>. 1907).<br>
<br>Between about 1891 and 1903 Cooke served in the London rifle brigade, which formed part of Britain's volunteer movement, initially as a &#145;sergeant instructor and in the ranks as a private&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the London rifle brigade</span>, 442). He was commissioned in 1893. He learned to fence in the London rifle brigade and became an accomplished practitioner of the sport. In 1902 he was a founding committee member of the Amateur Fencing Association.<br>
<br>In August 1905 Cooke was appointed secretary of the recently formed Automobile Association (AA) which then had around ninety members and &pound;100 in the bank. Charles Gulliver, personal assistant to an AA committee member, was &#145;mainly responsible&#146; for securing his appointment  (Barty-King, 67). The permanent staff of Cooke, a clerk, and an office boy occupied a single room in Fleet Street and had the use of only one borrowed typewriter  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 20 June 1930). Cooke's annual salary was in the region of &pound;200. At the time of his appointment he had travelled by car only twice and had little interest in or knowledge of motoring. He never learned to drive and never acquired a personal interest in motoring.<br>
<br>Nothing in Cooke's background qualified him to lead, as he soon did, a large national organization. Yet soon after his arrival the association expanded rapidly, acquiring thousands, soon hundreds of thousands, of members. Such success led to vastly expanded staff numbers and much enlarged business premises. On the eve of the Second World War, when Cooke was receiving an annual salary of about &pound;5000, the AA had 721,400 members and some 4000 employees. The association met a rapidly growing public need, but its success was also a testimony to Cooke's energy, determination, and exceptional organizational ability. He relentlessly promoted the AA and motoring through public relations stunts, letters and articles in the specialist and general press, and, later, radio broadcasts, books, gramophone records, and film. In addition he gave evidence to or served on several parliamentary inquiries into aspects of motoring&#151;always as a champion of the interests he was paid to represent, especially when questions of motoring taxes were at stake.<br>
<br>In Cooke's capacity as secretary of the AA one of his first tasks was to organize the cycle and motorcycle patrols employed to warn members about the location of police speed traps. Use of these patrols brought the association into conflict with police and government. Famously, Sir Edward Troup, permanent under-secretary at the Home Office, likened it to &#145;an association of burglars employing scouts to warn them which houses are and which are not watched by the police&#146; (Plowden, 90; TNA, HO 45/11117). A 1909 judgment ruled that the warnings were illegal. In response the AA instructed its patrolmen to desist from their regular practice of saluting members if police were carrying out speed checks in the vicinity, thereby providing to members a warning by default.<br>
<br>Under Cooke's leadership the AA accomplished much, including the early provision of petrol stations, introduction of an extensive network of road signposts, creation of the star grading system for hotels, establishment of an aviation service, and development of links with overseas motoring organizations. In addition Cooke played an important role in amalgamating the AA with the Motor Union (1910). He also presided over some missed opportunities. Most notable were his refusal to contemplate an alliance with the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), of which he had an almost &#145;pathological&#146; dislike  (Barty-King, 148), and his rejection of suggestions that the AA should emulate the RAC by establishing a full breakdown and &#145;get you home service&#146; for members  (Barty-King, 156&#150;7). This benefit was established only after Cooke's death.<br>
<br>In September 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, Cooke along with a contingent of AA patrolmen joined the 8th cycling battalion of the Essex regiment. He held the rank of captain. He did not accompany his battalion to France, but was attached to the War Office in January 1915 and promoted to the rank of major in June of the following year. At the Ministry of National Service in 1917&#150;18 he was, first, controller of supplies, then inspector of stationery charged with checking &#145;the appalling waste of printing and stationery throughout the Government Departments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Truth</span>, 23 June 1918). On two occasions the Liberal MP Percy Alden raised critical questions in parliament about the nature of Cooke's Whitehall post, the implication being that it was something of a sinecure  (<span class="italic">Hansard</span>, 105, 22 April 1918, cols. 682&#150;3, and 2 May 1918, 1724&#150;5). <span class="italic">Motor</span> magazine suggested that Alden was &#145;hankering for the gallant major's blood&#146;  (30 April 1918). Throughout the war Cooke continued to perform his duties at the much-diminished AA.<br>
<br>Cooke, known to his staff as &#145;the Chief&#146;, inspired contrasting feelings on the part of those who knew him. He was admired by some, but others regarded him as autocratic, patronizing, pompous, and humourless. He has also been termed a rabble-rouser who loved a skirmish. He had a keen appreciation of his own status and thought himself more important to the AA than the committee that ostensibly governed it. His sense of self-esteem and showmanship led him, in 1931, to install an intercom system that allowed him to address AA staff in London and, later, the regional offices. Cooke used this technology, reputedly the first such &#145;installation in any business house in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Star</span>, 31 March 1931), to maintain &#145;personal&#146; contact with his staff and boost their morale. In one broadcast, in February 1933, he described at length his experience of receiving a knighthood from the king at Buckingham Palace. Some within the AA hierarchy thought Cooke's commitment to the association waned once he received his knighthood and that he effectively &#145;gave up&#146; thereafter  (Barty-King, 166).<br>
<br>Cooke continued to fence at a high level until his sixties. In 1912 he took part in the Stockholm Olympics, where he failed to progress beyond the pool stage in any discipline. After many attempts and several near misses he achieved victory in the British amateur foils championship in 1923. He was the oldest winner of this title. Though selected for the men's team foil at the 1924 Paris Olympics, he did not compete. Over the course of four decades Cooke fenced for England and won many tournaments. In 1935 he won the Jean-Baptiste Mimiague trophy against opponents who were at least thirty years his junior  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 21 Nov 1942).<br>
<br>In appearance Cooke was well-groomed, handsome, and quite short. With his dapper dress sense and the waxed moustache he sported for much of his adult life, he was something of a dandy who &#145;fancied himself as a &#147;ladies' man&#148;&#146;. He steadily &#145;became more and more fastidious about his public image&#146;  (Barty-King, 67). Though a regular drinker and heavy smoker of cigars and a pipe, he was also a keep-fit enthusiast who daily engaged in Swedish exercises. He enjoyed ballroom dancing and socializing. His wife disliked the social side of her husband's job, and seldom went to the many functions he attended, so his daughter often accompanied him.<br>
<br>Aside from fencing and dancing Cooke's main leisure activity was writing for publication. A number of his short stories appeared in the magazine <span class="italic">Britannia and Eve</span>; they were later published in book form as <span class="italic">These Stories</span>. His best-known publication, <span class="italic">This Motoring</span> (1931), was turned into a film (1935) with Cooke in the starring role and his daughter among the cast. It dealt with the development of the AA and, particularly, his role in the process. The book went through many editions, not least because it was given to resigning members in the hope of luring them back to the fold. A later critic held Cooke responsible for &#145;some of the most embarrassing prose of the interwar period&#146;  (Plowden, 53).<br>
<br>An able linguist, Cooke travelled extensively in Europe and far beyond on AA business. He received many awards from overseas motoring organizations. In 1937 Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German ambassador in London, conferred upon him the Insignia of Honour First Class of the German Red Cross in recognition of his work on road safety. He was also awarded the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He died at Eaton Lodge, London Road, Guildford, Surrey, where the AA was based during the Second World War, on 19 November 1942. He was buried in Hampstead cemetery. The AA awarded his widow a &pound;10,000 gratuity and donated &pound;1000 to Charing Cross Hospital to endow a bed in her husband's memory.<br>
