<span class="headword">Robinson,  Roy Lister</span>, Baron Robinson  (1883&#150;1952), <span class="occ">forester</span>, was born on 8 March 1883 at Macclesfield, near Adelaide, South Australia, the eldest son of William Robinson, a mechanical engineer, and his wife, Annie Lowe. He was educated at St Peter's College, the School of Mines, and the university in Adelaide. He graduated BSc in 1903 and obtained his diploma in applied science (mining engineering) in 1904. Selected as South Australia's second Rhodes scholar, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1905. After achieving first-class honours in natural science (geology) in 1908, he was awarded the Burdett-Coutts scholarship and obtained his diploma in forestry under Sir William Schlich, who acclaimed Robinson as his most brilliant student. His athletic prowess was equally remarkable and he represented his university at lacrosse (1906&#150;9), athletics (1907&#150;9), and cricket (1908&#150;9). In middle life he changed to golf, commenting that it helped him to get to know younger members of staff in a less official atmosphere.<br>
<br>After university, Robinson stayed in Britain. He was appointed an assistant inspector in the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1909 and, three years later, was promoted superintending inspector. In 1910, he married Charlotte Marion Cust, daughter of Henry Cust Bradshaw. They had two daughters and one son, who became a wing commander and died in action in 1942. By intensive surveys in Wales and the north of England, and several extensive motorcycle tours of Scotland, Robinson laid the foundations of his wide knowledge of the growth of trees in Britain. In 1915 he was seconded to the Ministry of Munitions (this work earning him the OBE in 1918), but in 1916 he moved to become secretary to the forestry reconstruction (Acland) committee; in this post he helped to frame the committee's final report, which became the basis of forest policy for the next twenty years and led to the establishing of the Forestry Commission in 1919. Robinson was first a technical commissioner, then vice-chairman (1929), chairman (1932 until his death), and director-general (1945&#150;7). In 1931 he became the first Rhodes scholar to receive a knighthood.<br>
<br>&#145;[Robinson's] gigantic work in forming a Forestry Department from scratch&#146;  (Long, 2) to one responsible for over 1000 square miles by the time of his death was plagued by political, economic, and technical difficulties, especially in wartime. Apart from a year (1940) as deputy controller in the Ministry of Supply's timber control, Robinson remained in forestry, taking a leading part in the preparation of the commissioners' reports on post-war forest policy (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1942&#150;3, 4, Cmd 6447) and private woodlands (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1943&#150;4, 3, Cmd 6500). The Royal Forestry Society and private foresters objected to several of the proposals but Robinson succeeded in devising the &#145;dedication of woodlands&#146; scheme as a means of co-operation between the state and the private owner, to ensure that heavy wartime fellings were restocked.<br>
<br>Robinson's work extended beyond the United Kingdom. He was the only man to attend all six Commonwealth forestry conferences between 1918 and 1952. In each he played an increasingly important part: he was vice-chairman for the third conference in Australia in 1928, and chairman of the fourth conference (South Africa, 1935) and the fifth (UK, 1947). In 1947 he became the fifth Australian and first Rhodes scholar to be given a peerage. He took the title Baron Robinson, of Kielder Forest and of Adelaide. He was the first recipient (1947) of the medal of the Society of Foresters of Great Britain of which he had been first president (1926&#150;8), and he received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Aberdeen in 1951. He sat on the Forest Products Research Board, was a first governor of the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford (1924&#150;34), an honorary member of the American Society of Foresters and of the Institute of Foresters of Australia, and a corresponding member of the Agricultural Academy of France. He never fully recovered from a serious illness in 1950, but he was at the sixth Commonwealth forestry conference in Ottawa, and there he died, of pneumonia, on 5 September 1952. His wife survived him. His ashes were scattered in Kielder Forest, Northumberland.<br>
<br>Robinson was &#145;the chief architect in creating State forestry in the United Kingdom&#146;  (Steven, 274). He had a first-class brain, a forceful personality, and an impressive physique, which lent him natural authority. He disliked compromise, did not suffer fools gladly, but was a delightful friend. &#145;He won the respect of all who knew him and the affection of most&#146;  (Courthope, 58). One of his chief attributes was tenacity of purpose, while being cautious when faced with difficult technical problems. His approach to forestry was mathematical and detailed. Severely practical, he tried most operations himself and abandoned anything not strictly necessary. Believing that growing trees were the best indicators of site potential, he instituted many sample plots and trained upon them his great powers of observation. He came to view forests as living organisms in the widest sense, producers of timber but also a wise use of poor land, with all the economic and sociological implications. Anticipating the need for public recreation and enjoyment of forests, he advanced the idea of forest parks, the first of which (1936) predated national parks by fifteen years. Robinson went continually into the woods and remained an observant and practical forester to the end. &#145;An exceptional man alike in gifts and personality &hellip; he would have dominated the forestry world whether Chairman of the Forestry Commission or no&#146;  (Steven, 274).<br>
