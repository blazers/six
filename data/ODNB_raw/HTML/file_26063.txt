<span class="headword">Southwell, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1506&#150;1559), <span class="occ">lawyer and member of parliament</span>, was the second son of Francis Southwell (<i>d</i>. 1512) of Norfolk, and Dorothy, daughter and coheir of William Tendring of Little Birch, Essex. He was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26062/', "Sir Richard Southwell (1502/3&#150;1564)")</script>, the privy councillor. His uncle Sir Robert Southwell (<i>d</i>. 1514), of Woodrising, Norfolk, was an auditor of the exchequer and, like Francis, a member of Lincoln's Inn. By coincidence another Robert Southwell died in 1514; he was a bencher of Gray's Inn who lived in Suffolk. Francis Southwell's son was still a boy when these namesakes died. He entered the Middle Temple in the mid-1520s, and as early as 1529, about the time of his call to the bar, he was returned to parliament for Bishop's Lynn, in Norfolk. He was to serve in parliament, representing six different constituencies, for the remainder of his life. In 1535 he became doubly established in the world, both by securing the hand of Margaret, daughter and heir apparent of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19964/', "Sir Thomas Neville (d. 1542)")</script>, bencher of Gray's Inn and privy councillor, and by obtaining an appointment as common serjeant of London. In 1536 he moved to the less lucrative but more promising position of solicitor-general to the new court of augmentations, set up to handle the revenue arising from the dissolution of the monasteries, and in 1537 he became its attorney-general.<br>
<br>His marriage, and the death of his father-in-law, provided Southwell with a seat at Mereworth in Kent, and he was added to the commission of the peace for that county (and for Norfolk) in 1538. His office in the augmentations enabled him to acquire numerous parcels of monastic land, much of which he sold at a profit. In 1540 he surrendered that office and was sworn of the privy council, with a stipend of &pound;100, in order to serve as a master or receiver of requests in place of Sir Nicholas Hare. In the same year he delivered the autumn reading at the Middle Temple. The height of his legal career was reached on 1 July 1541, when he was appointed master of the rolls, with a knighthood following in 1542. After sitting in chancery for ten years he resigned in December 1550, though the reason is not apparent. He does not seem to have fallen out with the Edwardian regime, since he continued to serve actively on commissions and in parliament throughout the reign, and indeed through Mary's, proving his religious flexibility by managing to participate in heresy investigations under both monarchs. He died on 26 October 1559 and was buried on 8 November in Kent, presumably at Mereworth. Among other provisions in his will he left to his eldest son, Thomas, the manors of Chickering and Hoxne, in Suffolk, which he had purchased in the 1540s from his profits on land sales, a capital messuage in Bermondsey, Surrey, pieces of plate including &#145;a greate pott all gilt which Kinge Henrye the eight myne olde master gave me for my last new yeres gift&#146;, and hangings embroidered with the family arms and badges. His &#145;olde frende&#146; Sir Nicholas Bacon was made supervisor of the will jointly with Dame Margaret.<br>
