<span class="headword">Doyle,  John Andrew</span>  (1844&#150;1907), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 14 May 1844, the only child of Andrew Doyle (<i>d</i>. 1888), one-time editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and later a poor-law inspector, and Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8413/', "Sir John Easthope (1784&#150;1865)")</script>. He was educated at Eton College (1853&#150;62) and then, after a year of private tuition, at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1867 with first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>. Doyle remained in Oxford to study history, and in 1869 won the Arnold prize for an essay entitled &#145;The English colonies in America before the Declaration of Independence&#146;. Later in the same year he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, which he held for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Of sufficient private means not to have to earn a living, Doyle pursued two largely separate careers. In Oxford he was active and conscientious as a fellow of his college, serving as librarian (1881&#150;8) and helping to frame the revised All Souls statutes arising from the commission of 1887. His scholarly interest was in the British North American (mainland) colonies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, on which he wrote a series of volumes over the course of twenty-five years. This work presumably originated in his prize essay of 1869, which may in turn have reflected an interest arising from the American Civil War. His first publication was a textbook on the history of the USA (1875). Although Doyle's writings are seldom consulted today and have only a limited historiographical interest, they constitute the fullest and fairest treatment of colonial America by any British historian; they were only superseded by the works of American scholars in the early and mid-twentieth century. Apart from state papers in the Public Record Office (which were not then fully calendared), Doyle worked from printed sources and secondary works. Although he made at least one visit to the United States, it is not clear how well he knew the country, even those parts which had been settled by 1763. None the less, for someone writing in the reigns of Victoria and Edward VII, his grasp and relatively detached judgement are commendable.<br>
<br>When he was not in Oxford, Doyle lived with his parents, first in north Wales and then from 1880 in Brecknockshire, where after their deaths he remained in the house which they had had built for the rest of his own life. He took an active part in local affairs, and served as a justice of the peace, county councillor, deputy lieutenant, and sheriff. He was interested in the provision of higher education for the poor as well as the rich, but even more in field sports, notably the breeding of racehorses and fox-terriers. Mountain rock-climbing too was among his pastimes.<br>
<br>One interest drew together the Oxford and the Welsh halves of Doyle's life: rifle-shooting and the volunteer movement. Whether or not he was stimulated in this by his knowledge of American superiority over the British as marksmen in the eighteenth century, the efforts of such as Doyle surely contributed to the quality of British rifle-shooting in the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 and again in 1914. His health never seems to have been robust, and he died on 4 August 1907, after a long but unspecified illness, at his home, Pendarren, Crickhowell, Brecknockshire. His near contemporary and the author of his article in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, the warden of All Souls, Sir William Anson, would seem to have been his closest friend. A photograph reproduced in Doyle's posthumous <span class="italic">Essays on Various Subjects</span> (1911) shows a good-looking man in early middle age, with a terrier perched on his knee.<br>
