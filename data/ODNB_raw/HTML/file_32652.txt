<span class="headword">Cruikshank,  Robert James</span>  (1898&#150;1956), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, the son of Robert James Cruikshank, a coffee-house keeper from Balleer, co. Armagh, Ireland, and his wife, Ellen Batcheldor, from Kent, was born in Kensington, London, on 19 April 1898. Always known as Robin Cruikshank, he had little formal education, but read widely from childhood. He began a journalistic career as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Bournemouth Guardian</span>. After service in the First World War he was recommended to the news editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in London and remained with that organization for the rest of his life. In 1919 he was sent to Prague to report the founding of the Czechoslovak republic. From the quality of his dispatches his potential as a foreign correspondent was quickly recognized, and it was in this field that he made his mark in journalism. By 1924 he had risen to the post of diplomatic correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and four years later he was sent to represent the paper in New York.<br>
<br>In this position, which he held for the next eight years, Cruikshank made a reputation as one of the top-ranking British correspondents in America, both through his knowledge and sympathetic understanding of America and Americans and by the vividness and dependability of his reporting. Colleagues marvelled at how little of his copy ever needed alteration and described his stories as a &#145;sparkling run of words&#146; which completely &#145;outwrote his fellow correspondents&#146;  (Glenton and Pattinson, 50). It was once said of him by an American that he &#145;came to know Americans better than they knew themselves&#146;. His ability to understand and define the essence of a culture was shown in his novel <span class="italic">The Double Quest</span>, published in 1936, which wittily contrasted and compared British and American society.<br>
<br>When the post of managing editor of <span class="italic">The Star</span> became vacant in 1936, Cruikshank was invited to return to England to take it up. He was appointed a director of <span class="italic">The Star</span>, the evening stable companion of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> which in the interval had become the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. In 1939 he married Margaret Adele, who survived him, a journalist and daughter of Dr J. A. Macknight, of California. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>It was not surprising that after the outbreak of the Second World War Cruikshank's wide knowledge of the American press and pressmen, combined with his general journalistic talent and his gift for getting on with all manner of people, should have resulted in his being appointed in 1941 director of the American division at the Ministry of Information. He was absent from the editorial chair of <span class="italic">The Star</span> for the rest of the war. He was also in 1941&#150;2 deputy director-general of the British Information Services in the United States. This second Anglo-American period, with its combination of journalism and diplomacy, probably marked the peak of his professional achievement. In his wartime posts, he was remembered most vividly for his &#145;genius&#146; for creating in the office &#145;a real spirit of cooperation, extending down to the most junior member of staff&#146;  (Hamilton, 16). He was appointed CMG in 1945 and, the war over, returned to become, as it were, one of the senior statesmen of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> organization, being appointed a director of Daily News Ltd (the parent company), and of the News Chronicle Ltd.<br>
<br>Cruikshank took an active part in the editorial and general direction of both newspapers and seemed destined for the highest positions. It was a natural move, when Gerald Barry resigned from the editorship of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> at the end of 1947, that Cruikshank should succeed him. It is questionable whether his talent lay chiefly in the direction of editorship&#151;he was happier and more at ease writing himself than directing others to write&#151;and it seemed that the burdens of editorship lay rather heavily upon him. By 1954 his health had begun to show signs of deterioration which affected his grip on day-to-day control and by the end of the year he found it necessary to resign.<br>
<br>Cruikshank had continued to be a prolific writer in the post-war period. His book <span class="italic">Roaring Century</span>, written in 1946 to mark the centenary of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, gave a good example of his rich appreciation of Victorian Britain. Characteristically he waived his royalties in it in favour of the Printers' Pension Fund. Shortly afterwards he wrote <span class="italic">Charles Dickens and Early Victorian England</span> (1949) and in 1951 <span class="italic">The Moods of London</span>. Fellow journalists remembered him most for his &#145;happy disposition and a complete absence of pomposity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 May 1956, 13). His other great loves besides journalism and literature were music and the theatre: from 1947 to 1955 he was a governor of the Old Vic, and at one time he was among the sponsors of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He was also a delegate to the subcommission on freedom of information of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. He died at his home at 198 West Hill, Putney, London, on 14 May 1956, and was buried on 17 May after a funeral at Putney Vale cemetery.<br>
