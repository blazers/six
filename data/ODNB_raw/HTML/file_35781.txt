<span class="headword">Robertson, Sir  Howard Morley</span>  (1888&#150;1963), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, on 16 August 1888, the second child and younger son in the family of three children of Casper Ludovic van Uytrecht Robertson of Liverpool and his wife, Ellen Duncan, of Ohio. He was sent to Britain to be educated at Malvern College, and in 1905&#150;7 he attended the Architectural Association school of architecture, then located in Tufton Street, Westminster. This was followed by a course at the Ecole Sup&eacute;rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1908&#150;12), where he qualified with the French architectural diploma in 1913. He gained practical experience as an assistant in architects' offices in London, Boston, New York, and on a project in Le Touquet which brought him into contact with his future partner.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Robertson served with distinction in the army in France, 1915&#150;19, and was promoted to the rank of colonel and awarded the Military Cross, L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and USA certificate of merit; he was also appointed officier de l'Etoile Noire. On his return to Britain he joined with John Murray Easton (<i>d</i>. 1975) in private practice as Easton and Robertson. Robertson's cosmopolitan background was well complemented by Easton's creative skills and interests, and they shared an admirable enthusiasm and total commitment to their work. Their concern for excellence in building and for the satisfaction of the client were the underlying principles of their long and successful partnership.<br>
<br>In 1920 Robertson joined the teaching staff of the Architectural Association School of Architecture, which had by then moved to Bedford Square, to aid in the integration of student instruction with experience in the office and on site. He became a friend and travelling companion of the school's secretary, F. R. Yerbury. He was appointed principal of the Architectural Association school in 1926 and later director of education from 1929 to 1935, and it was during this period that the school achieved the distinction of being the first to receive final recognition of its diploma for full qualification. Robertson never allowed administrative matters to interfere unduly with lectures and personal contact through studio tuition. His aim was to teach broad principles, as reflected in his writings on theory and composition, urging students thereafter to find things out for themselves.<br>
<br>Robertson had thus a considerable influence during a period of aesthetic change. His teaching proved more progressive than his own designs, so often hampered by restrictions: although at one time he was a member of the international avant-garde group the Congr&egrave;s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), he withdrew because it was too partisan. By trips abroad, however, he kept in close touch with current movements both in continental Europe&#151;particularly in France, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Italy&#151;and in the United States, where in 1927 he renewed his acquaintance with and married a former architectural pupil, Doris Adeney, daughter of John Reynolds Lewis of Melbourne, Australia, and his wife, Sara Day. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>In the late 1920s, it became necessary for Robertson to devote all his time to a thriving and varied practice which merged in 1931 with that of Stanley Hall under the three names, until it was again reconstituted after the Second World War. He had become FRIBA in 1925 and later an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. In 1933 he was awarded the Godwin and Wimperis bursary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) for his report on continental schools; during this period he spent a short while in the tense atmosphere of the Bauhaus, then close to its disintegration.<br>
<br>Robertson's most notable commission, designed in collaboration with Easton, was the permanent exhibition hall for the Royal Horticultural Society, which was awarded the RIBA architecture bronze medal in 1928. This was one of many similar awards to the firm in later years: he received RIBA architecture bronze medals in 1936 and 1937. Robertson and Easton were at the forefront of modern developments with their designs for exhibition halls and similar types of building. They were involved with the design of the British pavilion at the 1925 Paris Exhibition of Decorative Arts, and further national exhibition pavilions at Brussels in 1935 and Johannesburg in 1937, and the New York World Fair in 1939, when Robertson received the distinction of being made honorary citizen of the city of New York. Other memorable achievements include: interior designs in hotels, such as the Berkeley, Savoy, and Claridge's, and for several large liners for the New Zealand Shipping Company; a hotel, bathing-pool, and pavilion at Prestatyn, north Wales; the printing works for the Bank of England at Debden, Essex; the post-war extension of the library at the University of Newcastle (1949&#150;60); the faculty of letters at Reading University, where he was honoured with a DLitt in 1957; Hatfield Technical College; and various office buildings, blocks of flats, and schools. Although Robertson's architecture tended towards the traditional rather than the modern, his teaching was more radical and his school produced many architects of the modern movement.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Robertson devoted much thought to designing the original standard industrial-type hostels used by the Ministry of Works, at the same time preparing typical schemes of interior decoration, the warm friendliness of which contributed to the hostels' success. In 1947 he served the Architectural Association as president during the centenary year, and thereafter remained on the advisory council. On the RIBA council he was vice-president (1938&#150;40) and president (1952&#150;4), and also served on the Building Industries' National Council. In 1949 he was awarded the royal gold medal for architecture, and in the same year was elected ARA; he became a full academician in 1958. He was knighted in 1954. His partner, Easton, achieved similar recognition. He was appointed president of the Architectural Association in 1939, served as vice-president of the RIBA 1945&#150;7, and was awarded the royal gold medal for architecture in 1955.<br>
<br>In the international field Robertson was technical adviser to the secretary-general in connection with the League of Nations building in Geneva and also a member of the jury which assessed the international competition for parliament buildings in Ankara. Later, in 1947, he was selected to be the British representative on the international board of design for the United Nations headquarters in New York, in which he showed courageous firmness for ethical as well as aesthetic rectitude. His last major work was the vast and immensely complicated Shell centre on the south bank of the River Thames, which was fated to receive from the critics less understanding tolerance than Robertson himself was inclined to show to others. He was a man of parts, liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company, with a keen appreciation of modern paintings and sculpture and of music&#151;reflecting a worldly wisdom lightened by humour. His career and personal credo are summed up in a series of autobiographical articles entitled &#145;Obbligato to Architecture&#146; in <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, published in April to June 1962. Among his other writings were <span class="italic">The Principles of Architectural Composition</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Modern Architectural Design</span> (1932). After a long illness, Howard Robertson died in London on 5 May 1963. His wife survived him.<br>
