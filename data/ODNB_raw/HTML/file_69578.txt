<span class="headword">Cawdrey,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>1537/8?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1604), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and lexicographer</span>, was born in 1537 or 1538; his parentage is unknown. Although four of his five sons are recorded as having studied at Cambridge&#151;Anthony, Thomas, and Zachary (father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4956/', "Zachary Cawdrey")</script>) as sizars at Christ's College, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4955/', "Daniel Cawdrey")</script> at Sidney Sussex College&#151;and he was vigorously to deny the charge of &#145;Want of Learning&#146;  (Strype, 131&#150;3), Robert himself received no university education. From <i>c</i>.1563 to 1571, however, he &#145;taught the Grammer Schoole at Okeham&#146;, Rutland  (R. Cawdrey, <span class="italic">Table Alphabeticall</span>, 1604, &#145;Epistle&#146;). Having been ordained deacon in 1565 and priest in 1570, he was presented to the living of South Luffenham, Rutland, by Lord Burghley and instituted as rector on 22 October 1571.<br>
<br>An uncompromising puritan, Cawdrey fell foul of the church authorities from at least 1576 (in which year he was said to be aged thirty-eight), when he was presented for not reading either injunctions or homilies in church, to September 1586, when he argued from the pulpit for the equality of Christian ministers, maintaining that lords spiritual should not lord it over their brethren, and fiercely attacked the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, &#145;a Vile book&#146; and &#145;Fy upon it&#146;  (Strype, 134). This led to a short period in ward and what Strype was to describe (at some length) as &#145;a tedious suit&#146;  (ibid., 147); it ended in the Star Chamber in June 1591, when the right of ecclesiastical courts to proceed upon ecclesiastical law, even in matters touched by statute law, was established, and the legality of sentences of deprivation of benefice (1585), and degradation from the priesthood (1590), confirmed. Throughout this time Cawdrey's patron Burghley, &#145;who had a Compassion for the Man, having a Wife and eight Children&#146;  (ibid., 132) and who was regularly petitioned by him, stood by him, intervening both directly and through the attorney of the court of wards. However, Cawdrey, having for four and a half years stubbornly refused to accept the legality of the decisions of the ecclesiastical courts, also spurned repeated attempts at conciliation by Burghley, Bishop Aylmer, and Archbishop Whitgift (including offers of a pension and even reinstatement).<br>
<br>After his ejection Cawdrey continued to express his puritan beliefs in <span class="italic">A Treasurie or Storehouse of Similies</span> (1600), a revised edition (1601) of his <span class="italic">Short and Fruitful Treatise of the Profit and Necessity of Catechisms</span> (1580), and (probably) <span class="italic">A Godlie Forme of Householde Government</span> &#145;gathered by R.C&#146; (1598). He is best known for <span class="italic">A table alphabeticall, conteyning and teaching the true writing, and understanding of hard usuall English wordes, borrowed from the Hebrew, Greek, Latine, or French etc with the interpretation thereof by plaine English words, gathered for the benefit &amp; helpe of ladies, gentlewomen, or any other unskilfull persons, whereby they may the more easilie and better understand many hard English wordes, which they shall heare or read in scriptures, sermons, or elsewhere, and also be made able to use the same aptly themselves</span> (1604). It was the first monolingual English dictionary ever published. This work, containing 2543 lemmas, &#145;long ago for the most part&#146;, Cawdrey explains, &#145;was gathered by me, but lately augmented by my sonne Thomas&#146;, a schoolmaster in London  (<span class="italic">Table Alphabeticall</span>, &#145;Epistle&#146;), and it was Thomas who revised the second edition in 1609 (3009 lemmas). However, subsequent editions, dated 1613 and 1617 (3086 and 3264 lemmas), do not name the reviser&#151;though they do remove the reference to women as their prime &#145;unskilfull&#146; target.<br>
<br>Cawdrey's <span class="italic">Table</span> is heavily derivative, taking over 90 per cent of the 1368 lemmas contained in the similarly named &#145;table&#146; of hard English words which concludes Edmund Coote's <span class="italic">Englishe Schole-Maister</span> (1596), and also drawing on Thomas Thomas's Latin&#150;English dictionary, Rastell's law dictionary, and at least three other specialist glossaries. The 1617 edition incorporates material (and part of its expanded title) from John Bullokar's <span class="italic">English Expositor</span> (1616). Cawdrey's <span class="italic">Table</span> was, in its 1613 edition, a major source for Bullokar, and it was used also by Henry Cockeram. Thomas Cawdrey died in Grantham in 1640. Robert himself is last heard of in Coventry in June 1604. Perhaps significantly, his personal epistle dedicatory is omitted from editions of the <span class="italic">Table</span> after 1609.<br>
