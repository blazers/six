<span class="headword">Lindsay,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1334<span class="mult">x</span>6), <span class="occ">bishop of Glasgow</span>, may have been the youngest son of John Lindsay, chamberlain of Alexander III. He was certainly closely related to that family, for he inherited the barony of Staplegordon, Dumfriesshire, as heir of Philip Lindsay, who was probably his elder brother. John held the church of Ratho in the diocese of St Andrews by early in the fourteenth century and, having received a university education before 1309, was also a canon of Glasgow for an unknown period of time. Although while he served in the St Andrews diocese Lindsay was used by Bishop William Lamberton for diplomatic and other duties, it seems that he probably supported the English king against Robert I before Bannockburn, suggesting that he had belonged to the Balliol&#150;Comyn faction. His brother Simon was captured by the Scots at Bannockburn, and John came to Scotland with an English safe conduct to arrange Simon's ransom.<br>
<br>Lindsay must have changed his allegiance soon afterwards, since King Robert chose him for the vacant see of Glasgow after the death of Stephen Dunnideer in 1317. The choice of Lindsay may represent Robert I's wish to indicate his willingness to promote such members of this influential family as would come to his peace. Lindsay's election was not approved by the pope, however, and his journey to the curia for consecration was futile. The papal choice of John Eglescliffe, an Englishman, was designed to satisfy Edward II. But Eglescliffe never gained possession of the see, and in 1323 was translated first to Connor in Ireland and then to Llandaff. (It seems that the Scottish king regarded the Glasgow see as being in his own hands during this period&#151;in effect vacant, if not technically so.) Thereafter Lindsay was accepted by the pope and was consecrated during the summer or autumn of that year. His canonry was then given to Walter Twynham, a favourite clerk of the king, who later became chancellor.<br>
<br>Lindsay's name is found regularly in the witness lists of the later acts of Robert I and, as a senior bishop, he appears at significant state events, such as the signing of the treaty of Edinburgh in 1328. Yet after Robert I's death he supported the kingship of Edward Balliol, and is last recorded as attending the parliament held by Balliol in February 1334. Lindsay's see was vacant by February 1336 and he must therefore have died before that date. There is no evidence to substantiate claims either that his allegiance reverted to the Bruce kingship before his death or that he died as a result of an attack by English pirates on the ship that was bringing him back to Scotland from Flanders. It was his successor at Glasgow, John Wishart, who perished thus in 1337. According to John Spotswood, Bishop Lindsay was buried in the lower church of his cathedral.<br>
