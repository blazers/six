<span class="headword">Impey,  Catherine</span>  (1847&#150;1923), <span class="occ">political activist and temperance reformer</span>, was born at Street in Somerset on 13 August 1847. Her parents were Robert Impey (1820&#150;1886), originally a tanner, who grew seeds, became an innovative farmer, and sold agricultural equipment, and his wife, Mary Hannah Clothier (1823&#150;1895), whose father was a tanner. Catherine, their second daughter, attended a school for girls at Weston-super-Mare. The Impey family belonged to the Religious Society of Friends.<br>
<br>Catherine Impey (known as Katie) was active in the temperance movement with a special commitment to work on behalf of children. She served for over forty years as the treasurer of the village mission and Band of Hope in Street. She was also a vice-president of the Western Temperance League, an office-holder in the Independent Order of Good Templars (a fraternal temperance society), and a member of the Street Teetotal Society, the Somerset Band of Hope Union, and the British Women's Temperance Association. She travelled to North America several times for meetings of the Good Templars and of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.<br>
<br>During the Good Templar schism of 1876&#150;87 Impey served as honorary secretary of a British mission committee which attempted to organize black people on a non-racial basis in the former slave states, an enterprise financed almost entirely by Quakers. Initiated by Good Templars in England and Scotland opposed to racism, the schism combined conflicts over human rights and Good Templar constitutional procedures with a struggle for power within the order. During this period many prominent Good Templars visited her home. The celebrated black writer William Wells Brown was her guest at Street, and she stayed at his home while visiting Massachusetts. Impey was outraged when in 1886 Joseph Malins (1844&#150;1926), the head of the Grand Lodge of England, negotiated an end to the schism on a basis of racial segregation, a compromise which she deplored as unchristian and contrary to Good Templar principles of brotherhood and sisterhood. Three years later she withdrew from the Good Templar order.<br>
<br>Devoting much of the rest of her life to the fight for racial equality, Impey had already started a monthly news-sheet called <span class="italic">Anti-Caste</span> in 1888. It campaigned against the racial bigotry suffered by non-white peoples throughout the world, particularly in the British empire and the United States. Impey also belonged to the anti-slavery committee of the mid-Somerset monthly meeting of the Society of Friends and the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s Impey acquired an ally, Isabelle Fyvie Mayo (1843&#150;1914), a Scottish novelist. The two women invited Impey's friend Ida B. Wells, a former slave, to speak in Britain against the lynching of black Americans accused of such crimes as sexual offences against white women. Impey and Mayo organized the Society for the Recognition of the Universal Brotherhood of Man. Its organ, variously called <span class="italic">Fraternity</span> and the <span class="italic">Bond of Brotherhood</span>, first appeared simultaneously with <span class="italic">Anti-Caste</span> and then replaced it.<br>
<br>Impey fell in love with Mayo's Ceylonese prot&eacute;g&eacute;, a dentist named George Ferdinands, and in 1893 she wrote to him proposing marriage. She believed that racial difference made him hesitant to declare his own love. Ferdinands, who had no interest in marrying Impey, showed the letter to Mayo. Infuriated at Impey's initiative, Mayo severed her relations with Impey and tried unsuccessfully to make Wells do the same. Mayo wrote to Frederick Douglass and other prominent African-Americans in a vain attempt to turn them against their old friend. The breakup of the alliance between Impey and Mayo explains Impey's brief revival of <span class="italic">Anti-Caste</span> in 1894; it ceased publication in 1895.<br>
<br>In addition to her work for temperance and against racism Catherine Impey was active in local government. Serving on the Street urban district committee, the Wells poor-law board of guardians, and the Long Sutton school committee, she advocated women's suffrage in parliamentary elections.<br>
<br>Impey's family supported her throughout all her public and private controversies. Although at one time engaged to T. Beavan Clark, whose family operated a shoe factory at Street, Impey never married, and resided all her life at her family home. From 1879 she was a vegetarian; so apparently was the rest of the household, but meat was served to non-vegetarian guests. Long before their father's death in 1886, Impey's elder sister Ellen (or Nellie) took charge of the family seed business despite her poor health. The Impeys also attempted jam making but with little success.<br>
<br>Impey combined militancy with affability, near austerity with generosity. Outspoken and uncompromising, she had a gift for friendship and served local needs as well as worldwide humanitarian causes. By living simply, she found the income to maintain a furnished house for retired teachers and missionaries on furlough. A devout member of the Society of Friends, she wrote frequently for the monthly magazine of Street's Quaker community. Impey died at her home, 3 Wraxhill Road, Middle Leigh, Street, on 14 December 1923 after a short illness; she was buried in Street on 18 December.<br>
