<span class="headword">Macbride,  John David</span>  (1778&#150;1868), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 28 June 1778 at Plympton St Maurice, Devon, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17362/', "John Macbride (c.1735&#150;1800)")</script>, naval captain (later MP for Plymouth, 1784&#150;90, and admiral, 1799), and his wife, Ursula, eldest daughter of William Folkes, of Hillington Hall, Norfolk. The physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17360/', "David Macbride")</script> was his uncle. After being educated at Cheam School, Surrey, he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 28 March 1795, graduating BA in 1799. On 9 July 1800 he became a fellow of Exeter, vacating the fellowship on his marriage (19 July 1805) to Mary (1770/71&#150;1862), second daughter of Sir Joseph Radcliffe, bt, and widow of Joseph Starkie, of Redvales. The couple had one child, a daughter.<br>
<br>Macbride then took up legal studies, becoming both BCL and DCL in November 1811; he served as assessor of the chancellor's court of Oxford University from 1812 to 1840. He also interested himself in oriental literature, and in 1813 was appointed lord almoner's reader in Arabic (from 1862, professor). In 1813 he also became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and was appointed principal of Magdalen Hall, succeeding Henry Ford in both this and the readership. He retained these Oxford appointments until his death. He held several other university offices, being a perpetual delegate of privileges from 1813, a perpetual delegate of the university press from 1814, a commissioner of sewers (1823&#150;45), and of the market (1825&#150;66).<br>
<br>Macbride was made principal of Magdalen Hall to supervise its projected transfer to the site of the former Hertford College, which it acquired in 1816; this move, made more urgent when the hall's original buildings adjoining Magdalen College were damaged by fire in 1820, was completed in 1822. The hall prospered under him, and especially under his energetic vice-principal from 1832 to 1848, William Jacobson, afterwards bishop of Chester; shortly after Macbride's death it achieved college status as the present Hertford College (1874). In 1863 the jubilee of his headship was marked by the foundation of the Macbride scholarship; he was also commemorated by the annual Macbride university sermon, which he endowed in 1848.<br>
<br>Macbride published three volumes of his theology lectures, and a few other articles and speeches, but his principal work was <span class="italic">The Mohammedan Religion Explained</span> (1857), a polemic with no pretension to original research, despite its impressive number of Arabic quotations. He was not a man of deep learning, but a profoundly religious layman of the &#145;old&#146; evangelical school, politically a moderate Conservative, and in character kind, sincere, and humorous. Well off himself, he was known for his generosity to the poor. He died at Oxford on 24 January 1868 and was buried on 30 January in Holywell cemetery; he was mourned as one of the last links with the Oxford of the previous century.<br>
