<span class="headword">Crossing,  William</span>  (1847&#150;1928), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 14 November 1847 in Plymouth, Devon, the second son of Joseph Crossing, a canvas mill owner. He was educated at a clergyman's school in Plymouth, the Independent college at Taunton, and Mannamead School at Plymouth. He then joined the family business in Plymouth and later worked at the South Brent mill. Here, his lifelong fascination with Dartmoor lured him away from his job to explore the moorlands.<br>
<br>The mill failed, and Crossing decided to earn his living by writing about Dartmoor. On 14 March 1872 he married Emma Witheridge of Ivybridge (there were no children of the marriage), and about this time he began to keep detailed notes of his expeditions and of the prehistoric and historic remains which he had found. His early researches were directed mainly towards medieval stone crosses, many of them almost forgotten and neglected; he wrote several books on the subject, the earliest being <span class="italic">The Ancient Crosses of Dartmoor</span> (1887). A popular figure, Crossing made friends with farmers and moormen wherever he went: he would entertain the local people around a peat fire with his tin whistle or with improvised rhymes describing his day on the moor. He usually walked clad in leather gaiters and tweeds.<br>
<br>By the 1890s Crossing was in some financial difficulties. A frequent contributor of articles to local journals, he now turned to journalism to pay his way. Two of his series of newspaper articles about Dartmoor were subsequently published as books, <span class="italic">A Hundred Years on Dartmoor</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Gems in a Granite Setting</span> (1905). These titles were reprinted in 1967 and 1986 respectively, and others have appeared since.<br>
<br>Crossing's numerous soakings on the moor were now beginning to affect his health and writing abilities (he was stricken with rheumatism), but in 1906 a benefactor, W. P. Collins, engaged him as tutor to his three sons. While he was thus employed, he was able to write his <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">Guide to Dartmoor</span> (1909, 1912, and 1914). This book ran to 528 closely printed pages and continues to be the standard topographical account of upland Dartmoor. It was reprinted in facsimile in 1965 with a lengthy introduction and is still in print at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<br>
<br>Crossing's last years were saddened by the death of his wife, on 6 June 1921, while she was a patient in the Tavistock Institution, the local workhouse. Later his landlady destroyed his notes and papers gathered over a lifetime, and he in turn had a spell in the workhouse. Once again, he was rescued by Collins, who installed him in Cross Park House, a nursing home in Plymouth, and paid all the bills until Crossing's death there on 3 September 1928. On 6 September he was buried with his wife in Mary Tavy churchyard on the western edge of Dartmoor.<br>
