<span class="headword">Temple,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1705, <em>d.</em> 1773), <span class="occ">clothier and writer on economics</span>, was born at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, where he was baptized on 3 August 1705, the son of William Temple (<i>d</i>. 1736), a clothier, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was brought up a General Baptist as a member of the Conigre church, which during his early life was moving into Arianism, and he was almost certainly educated at the dissenting academy associated with the church. He was in business as a clothier on his own account by 1724 and left off trade about 1756.<br>
<br>Temple's first published work was a eulogistic obituary of his father, contributed to the <span class="italic">Gloucester Journal</span> in 1736. In 1738 trade depression led to weavers' riots in west Wiltshire. Their complaints, particularly of lowered rates for weaving and of truck payments, were vividly and sympathetically presented by Country Commonsense (Thomas Andrews of Seend) in an &#145;Essay on riots&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gloucester Journal</span>. Temple's reply also appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and was reprinted as a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Case as it now Stands between the Clothiers, Weavers and other Manufacturers</span>, under the pseudonym Philalethes. In this work Temple adopted a tone which was a sorry contrast to the measured statement of the &#145;Essay on riots&#146;. He bitterly attacked the justices who supported prosecutions for truck payments, he complained of the idleness and drunkenness of the workpeople, and he argued that high prices and low wages were necessary to make them industrious. Weavers were the object of his particular scorn, &#145;the most feeble, weak, and impotent of all the manufacturers&#146;; putting a child apprentice to a weaver meant that he could obtain &#145;a comfortable subsistence with scarce any human abilities&#146;  (W. Temple, <span class="italic">The Case as it now Stands</span>, 1739, 12, 13).<br>
<br>It was at the same period that Temple entered into controversy with John Smith, the author of <span class="italic">Chronicon rusticum-commerciale, or, Memoirs of Wool</span> (1747). In 1739 he replied to Smith's anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">The Grazier's Complaint</span>, which complained of the low price of English wool, with a characteristic piece of detailed argument to show the greater advantage to the country gained by working up the wool into cloth; this appeared in the <span class="italic">Sherborne Mercury</span> under the pseudonym Weaver on 6 February 1739. Smith's <span class="italic">Chronicon rusticum-commerciale</span> provoked a <span class="italic">Refutation</span> by Temple of one of its principal arguments, that English wool was underpriced compared with Spanish. This pamphlet appeared in 1750, as did a rejoinder by Smith &#145;in answer to Mr. Temple's (pretended) Refutation&#146;. Early in 1751 Temple had the last word in an <span class="italic">Epistle</span> to Smith, subtitled <span class="italic">An Expostulatory Address to him upon his Forgery and Chicanery</span>. This pamphlet announced proposals for printing <span class="italic">A Discourse upon Wools</span> by Temple, but it is not known to have been published.<br>
<br>In 1758 Temple's controversial skills were deployed against William Bell, who had received a Cambridge prize for a <span class="italic">Dissertation on Populousness</span> which advocated the renunciation of commerce in favour of a purely agricultural society. Temple's <span class="italic">Vindication of Commerce and the Arts</span> appeared under the pseudonym I. B., MD.<br>
<br>In his later years Temple was a supporter of John Wilkes; he held a f&ecirc;te in his garden to celebrate Wilkes's release from prison in 1770, sent &pound;20 towards his expenses in 1772, and in his will left him &pound;500 &#145;for his strenuous exertions in the cause of liberty&#146;. He died at Trowbridge on 16 May 1773 of a paralytic stroke and was buried at St James's Church, Trowbridge, on 20 May.<br>
<br>Temple left no living children, and his wife, Grace, had died in 1769. Also in his will he left &pound;2000 to the City of London to found a professorship at Gresham College; the holder was to expound the views expressed in the <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, which was summarized under seven headings in the will, beginning: &#145;1. That all mankind are naturally inclined to indolence&#146;. The will provided that Temple's papers should be edited and a digest printed and sold at a moderate price, one copy being given gratis to each corporation in England. His library of 1500 volumes was left to Gresham College. In fact, for reasons unknown, none of the provisions of the will was acted upon.<br>
