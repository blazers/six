<span class="headword">Guevara,  &Aacute;lvaro  Ladr&oacute;n de</span>  (1894&#150;1951), <span class="occ">artist and boxer</span>, was born on 13 July 1894 at Cerro Alegre, Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, the tenth of the twelve children of Luis Ladr&oacute;n de Guevara (1840?&#150;1912), a prosperous woollen exporter, and his wife, Ida Juana Mar&iacute;a Reimers Bode (1857&#150;1943). Luis Guevara, though he knew only a few words of English, was passionately Anglophile and sent his children to the best English schools in Chile. His wife, whom he married when she was just sixteen, came from a wealthy Danish family, her own mother was German, and their daughters all married men of different nationalities; thus the young &Aacute;lvaro Guevara grew up in cosmopolitan surroundings. His childhood was spent between two homes&#151;the ostentatiously decorated house embellished everywhere with gold leaf, which his father had built overlooking Valpara&iacute;so harbour, where he maintained a large staff and a menagerie of animals, and which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1906; and the farmhouse beside a volcano on their <i>fundo</i> (country estate) at Curileo in Arauco. Guevara took an energetic part in the family routine of tennis tournaments, riding expeditions, musical entertainments, and parties; he also showed a precocious talent for both painting and boxing.<br>
<br>In 1910, at the suggestion of his elder brother Lucho, who was running the family's business interests in Yorkshire, Guevara and his two youngest sisters were sent to England; their parents followed shortly afterwards and moved into the Majestic Hotel at Harrogate. Guevara entered Bradford Technical College, where he was miserable and homesick: he had no inclination to train for the wool trade and left without any qualifications. However, encouraged by his brother's friends William and Albert Rothenstein, he secretly attended evening classes at the local art school; and in 1912 he applied to, and was awarded a scholarship at, the Slade School of Fine Art in London.<br>
<br>Guevara joined the Slade at one of its most brilliant periods. His fellow pupils included David Bomberg, Mark Gertler, Paul and John Nash, and Stanley and Gilbert Spencer. These, and the female students&#151;among whom were Dora Carrington, Iris Tree, and Lady Diana Manners (later Diana Cooper)&#151;were intrigued by the exuberant but conscientious South American, though they soon took to him and dubbed him Chile, the nickname by which he was afterwards always known. During his four years at the Slade (1912&#150;16) Guevara picked up a handful of prizes. More importantly, he caught the eye of former students such as C. R. W. Nevinson and of three older and eminent figures: Augustus John, whose table at the Caf&eacute; Royal or Tour Eiffel restaurant he often joined; Walter Sickert, who introduced him to the Marylebone swimming-baths, where he painted a series of scenes in the manner of Matisse; and Roger Fry, whose two post-impressionist exhibitions he had seen and who invited him to exhibit at the Omega workshops in 1916. The interiors of theatres and caf&eacute;s were often the subjects of Guevara's paintings: they were executed in the bright, simplified idiom of the modern movement and brought him quick recognition. He first exhibited at the New English Art Club in 1915 (he was elected a member in 1920), was given a one-man show at the Chenil Galleries in 1917, and was a regular contributor to exhibitions of the National Portrait Society and the International Society.<br>
<br>Guevara also enjoyed a heady social success in the worlds of bohemia and the beau monde, to which the portraits he painted at this time are testament. These were perhaps his most notable achievements: he succeeded in relating his sitters closely to their environment and realizing a precise but rich harmony of colour and design, as well as a telling revelation of character. Among his best-known images are <span class="italic">Mrs Lewis of the Cavendish</span> (1915, exh. New English Art Club 1922; priv. coll.), a portrait of the hotel owner Rosa Lewis; <span class="italic">Ronald Firbank</span> (1919, exh. Tate Gallery, London, 1921; untraced); and <span class="italic">Nancy Cunard</span> (1919, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne). Guevara was bewitched by Nancy Cunard and obsessively in love with her for several years. At the same time, Edith Sitwell had fallen for him; he painted a celebrated portrait of her, <span class="italic">The Editor of &#145;Wheels&#146;</span> (<i>c</i>.1916, Tate collection), and, though her passion was unrequited, they remained close allies. The poetry he was then writing was an important bond between Guevara and both women. The Sitwells were one of several artistic groupings in London whose encouragement and patronage he enjoyed; and Edith's brother Osbert wrote the introduction to his exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1926, held after a period of a few years during which he lived in Chile.<br>
<br>In 1927 Guevara moved to Paris, where he was prominent in the society that gathered at the atelier of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. He was given an exhibition at the Galerie Van Leer in November 1928 and on its last day there he met the painter Meraud Michael Guinness (1904&#150;1993), daughter of Sir Benjamin and Lady Guinness, whose first show followed his. She had previously tried to elope with the artist Christopher Wood and had then become the pupil and mistress of another, Francis Picabia. Guevara's encounter with her ended his long search for a wife. He and Meraud were married in London in 1929 and their daughter Bridget (known as Nini) was born in Paris in 1931. Less than a year later, however, they parted, and Guevara sank into a long despondency, during which he often preferred to write rather than paint.<br>
<br>As the citizen of a neutral country, Guevara remained in Paris after the German invasion in 1940. But the following year he was taken hostage by the Nazis and incarcerated in the notoriously brutal Cherche-Midi prison. After being diagnosed as paranoid, he was repatriated to Chile. At the war's end he was appointed Chilean honorary consul in London; a year later he was transferred to Bern as cultural attach&eacute;. In 1948 Meraud Guinness persuaded him to move to Aix-en-Provence, and he made a studio in the grounds of La Tour de C&eacute;sar, the estate where she and her coterie of gypsies and hangers-on had settled, and where he was reunited with his daughter.<br>
<br>Through his last years in Provence, when he was slowly dying, Guevara displayed the dignity which was the essential aspect of his character. He was always immaculately groomed, and dressed in a dark suit and white silk shirt even when painting; his voice was gentle, foreign, and friendly. His exotic good looks&#151;his height, olive skin, and glossy blue-black hair&#151;were immediately attractive, and he had several affairs with people of both sexes. In all his various vocations, including boxing (for which he won the gold belt as champion of all weights in South America in 1924), he maintained an air of supreme cultivation.<br>
<br>Guevara died of cancer of the liver and lungs at La Tour de C&eacute;sar on 11 October 1951; the funeral took place on 15 October and his body was later interred locally in St Marc's cemetery. One of his few surviving writings, his <span class="italic">Dictionnaire intuitif</span>, unfinished at his death, was privately printed in 1954 at Meraud Guinness's instigation. In the early 1970s&#151;just before publication of Diana Holman-Hunt's entertaining biography&#151;a discovery was made of more than forty of his works, including some of his most important post-impressionist paintings, which were thought to have been destroyed in London during the blitz. Their subsequent exhibition confirmed his early distinction and secured his posthumous reputation.<br>
