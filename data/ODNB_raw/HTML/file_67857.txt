<span class="headword">Sampson,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at South Leverton, Nottinghamshire, where he was baptized on 14 June 1635, a younger son of William Sampson (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;<i>c</i>.1636) and his wife, Helen (1603&#150;1687), daughter of Gregory Vicars (in December 1637 she married the puritan minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11522/', "Obadiah Grew")</script>). The family were Nottinghamshire yeomanry who achieved literary and academic success. The younger William's brother was the eminent dissenting minister and medical lecturer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24592/', "Henry Sampson")</script>, his stepbrother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11521/', "Nehemiah Grew, FRS")</script>, the celebrated botanist. At the age of eighteen William Sampson went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in the Lent term 1654; he graduated BA in 1657, and proceeded MA in 1660, in which year he became a fellow of the college. As treasurer Sampson was an able administrator at Pembroke, and his financial accounting system instituted in 1667&#150;8 lasted until the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Sampson was presented to the rectory of Tilney, Norfolk, in 1669, and subsequently to the rectory of Clayworth, Nottinghamshire, in 1672. He was a prebendary of Lincoln for Clifton from the same year. Sampson was appointed president of Pembroke College in 1672 (the second most senior position), and left Clayworth in the hands of a curate for the next three years before returning to Nottinghamshire, in a final protest against the validity of the fellowship of Nathaniel Coga, who had been elected in 1658 and confirmed by royal mandate after the Restoration. Coga was elected master of Pembroke in 1677, and Sampson had little more to do with the college although he was one of the subscribers to the work on the new library in 1690. When Sampson was himself brought news in January 1694 by two fellows that he had been elected master of Pembroke following Coga's death, he declined the office and stayed in Clayworth.<br>
<br>Sampson continued as rector and prebendary until his own death on 30 October 1702. He was buried in Clayworth nine days later. He bequeathed to Pembroke the advowson of Earl Stonham, Suffolk. Meanwhile Henry Sampson had left his Clapham, Surrey, home a sick man in mid-July 1700 to stay with his brother at Clayworth, and died there later that month; William's nephew and intended heir Nathaniel, who lived with him, had died the previous year.<br>
<br>One of Sampson's early acts at Clayworth was to purchase a vellum book as his parish and personal record, for &#145;A Register is so useful and necessary a thing that the places of learning, wisdom and business could never be without one.&#146; This earns Sampson his particular place in posterity: most aspects of parish life and work are reflected in it. Sampson recorded his own farming account and profit, with frequent disputes about tithes and piecemeal enclosure of the former common fields. He noted extreme weather conditions, pursued attempts to educate and reform the manners of the poor, was pleased by the extent of religious conformity in the parish, and recorded reactions to the extraordinary political and religious events of the revolution of 1688&#150;9. In 1676 and again in 1688 he listed the population of the parish, household by household&#151;on the former occasion alphabetically, on the latter topographically beneath the principal household of Mr Thomas Wawen, &#145;Lord of the Soil&#146;.<br>
<br>Sampson's <span class="italic">Rector's Book</span>, published in 1910, has been used to illustrate many aspects of parochial life, religious conformity, and agricultural history. In 1963 it formed a building block of the new social history pioneered by Peter Laslett, who used Sampson's population counts in 1676 and 1688 to measure turnover of population. Far from being rooted to the soil the inhabitants were mobile; twenty-three of the ninety-one households in the later year were new formations, ten households were &#145;entirely novel&#146;. Yet population size changed little overall, at a shade over 400, and the family structure&#151;small, nuclear, two-generational households with servants living in&#151;remained identical. Study since has served to underline rather than undermine the broad picture of village family and social structure Laslett painted using this almost unique source.<br>
