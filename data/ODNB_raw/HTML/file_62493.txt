<span class="headword">Bury,  Charles Kenneth  Howard-</span>  (1883&#150;1963), <span class="occ">mountaineer and army officer</span>, was born at Charleville Castle, King's county, Ireland, on 15 August 1883, the only son of Captain Kenneth Howard-Bury (1846&#150;1885), army officer, and his wife, Lady Emily Alfreda Julia (1856&#150;1931), youngest daughter of Charles William Bury, third earl of Charleville. He had one sister, Marjorie (1885&#150;1907). His mother had become heir to the estates at Charleville Forest, King's county, after the last of her brothers and uncles died in 1875, and the peerage became extinct. His father, a grandson of the sixteenth earl of Suffolk and Berkshire, assumed the additional surname of Bury after their marriage in 1881; on his death in 1885, Lord Lansdowne, viceroy of India and a relative, was appointed to be Howard-Bury's guardian. He was educated privately at Charleville, at Eton College, and at the Royal Military College in Sandhurst (1902&#150;4).<br>
<br>Howard-Bury joined the 60th rifles in 1904 and was posted to India, where he went travelling and big game-hunting. In 1905 he secretly entered Tibet without permission and was rebuked by Lord Curzon. His early travel diaries date from 1906 and show his keen powers of observation, encyclopaedic knowledge of natural history, and linguistic ability. In 1912 he inherited Belvedere House, Mullingar, co. Westmeath, from a cousin, Charles Brinsley Marlay. In that year he spent six months in the Tien Shan (Tianshan) Mountains. Although he prepared a draft book from his diaries, it was not published until 1990, as <span class="italic">The Mountains of Heaven</span>. He resumed army duties in 1915 and commanded the 7th and 9th battalions of the King's Royal Rifles (dispatches seven times; DSO in 1918). He served at Arras, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Ypres, where he was captured; he remained a prisoner of war at F&uuml;rstenberg until 1919.<br>
<br>After the war the Royal Geographical Society was eager to attempt the ascent of Mount Everest, but political opposition from Tibet and from the British government remained an obstacle. In 1920 Howard-Bury travelled to India at his own expense to lobby the government of India. He met the viceroy and other British officials, including Charles Bell, the political officer in Sikkim, who shortly afterwards received permission from Tibet for an Everest expedition in 1921. Though not an experienced climber, Howard-Bury was offered the leadership of the first Everest expedition partly in recognition of his role in persuading British officials to obtain permission from Tibet. Howard-Bury led a diverse expedition of surveyors, climbers, and military officers, which achieved the goals of surveying Everest and finding a route to the summit for later climbers. He wrote <span class="italic">Mount Everest: the Reconnaissance, 1921</span> (1922), which later appeared in French and Dutch and a shorter version in 1991. A variety of white primula discovered during the expedition was named after him, <i>Primula buryana</i>. He was awarded the founders' medal of the Royal Geographical Society and gold medals from the French Geographical Society and Club Alpin Fran&ccedil;ais (French Alpine Club).<br>
<br>The Everest expedition made Howard-Bury a public figure and in 1922 he was elected to parliament for Bilston (South Wolverhampton) as a Unionist. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the under-secretary of state for war from 1922 to 1924, when he lost his seat. He was elected as MP for Chelmsford in 1926, but retired in October 1931, after he inherited his ancestral castle at Charleville on the death of his mother. He served as deputy lieutenant and JP in co. Westmeath and also honorary colonel to the 85th East Anglian field brigade of the Territorial Army from 1927 to 1932. During the Second World War he was appointed an assistant commissioner of the British Red Cross.<br>
<br>About 1940 Howard-Bury met Rex Beaumont (1914&#150;1988), an actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company then in the Royal Air Force, who became his close friend and heir. In the post-war period Howard-Bury and Beaumont restored Belvedere House and gardens and built a villa at Dar al-Oued in Hammamet, Tunis. Dar al-Oued became a meeting-place for creative personalities and authors such as Andr&eacute; Gide, Sacheverell Sitwell, and Dame Freya Stark. Howard-Bury and Beaumont continued to entertain many writers, explorers, politicians, and clerics at Dar al-Oued and at Belvedere, and became close friends with Colonel H. al Bourguiba, first president of Tunisia. The only known portrait of Howard-Bury was painted at Dar al-Oued by Paul Hannaux. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall, had the appearance of a distinguished gentleman, and was widely known as &#145;Monsieur Le Colonel&#146;. Howard-Bury died of old age at Belvedere House on 20 September 1963 and was buried in his family's vault in St Katherine's Church, Tullamore. He bequeathed Charleville to a cousin and Belvedere to Rex Beaumont. He never married.<br>
