<span class="headword">McLevy,  James</span>  (1793/4?&#150;1873), <span class="occ">police officer and author</span>, was born near Markethill in the parish (whether Roman Catholic or civil is not clear) of Ballymacnab, co. Armagh, the son of John McLevy, weaver, and his wife, Catherine Dourie. McLevy remained true to his Catholic faith, which helped to define his approach to crime and detection throughout his police career in Edinburgh. A memoir of McLevy published in 1861 claimed that his father had been a farmer, but in Armagh smallholding and linen weaving were commonly joint occupations. After an elementary education McLevy's first job (at the age of thirteen) was as an apprentice fine-linen weaver. Still in his teens, about 1811, he married Rosa O'Neill and the couple migrated to Scotland. After living for two years in the textile town of Gatehouse-of-Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire, they moved to Edinburgh, where Rosa died shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>At the time of McLevy's arrival Edinburgh was going through a construction boom, due to its prestigious New Town development, and like many Irish incomers he found work as a builder's labourer. His reliability and strong work ethic were recognized by one employer, Robert Paterson, who in 1830 recommended McLevy as a suitable recruit to the city's police. He duly entered the force as a night watchman, the equivalent of a constable, and in 1833 was promoted to the rank of criminal officer. Captain James Stewart, superintendent of the Edinburgh police, was anxious to nurture a corps of specialists dedicated to detecting and prosecuting offenders, although his officers had more in common with the &#145;thief-takers&#146; of London's Bow Street runners than the crack detective department of Scotland Yard, inaugurated in 1842. It was only during the 1850s that the term &#145;detective&#146; began to be widely used in Edinburgh, and even when McLevy effectively retired in 1860 there was still ambiguity about whether his formal designation was as principal criminal officer or detective.<br>
<br>From the names of McLevy's fellow officers&#151;such as Fallon, Reilly, and Mulholland&#151;it is evident that men of Irish extraction constituted a significant presence in Edinburgh's police during the mid-nineteenth century. The work was physically demanding, yet Edinburgh wage rates remained low and produced a high turnover of recruits. McLevy's longevity in service was unusual, and from the outset he demonstrated a determination to succeed. An incentive may have been the additional money that could be earned from rewards, as was indicated when an Edinburgh magistrate congratulated the team of McLevy and William Mulholland for apprehending a record number of offenders over a six-week period  (<span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>, 11 Aug 1834). McLevy's exploits soon became a regular feature of city newspapers, and although his cases occasionally involved capital crimes like homicide, the overwhelming focus of his investigations was on the everyday offences of house-breaking, shop-breaking, thieving, resetting (receiving stolen goods), and fraud.<br>
<br>McLevy developed a gift for connecting with the inhabitants of the Old Town &#145;conglomerates&#146;, which included the overcrowded wynds and closes of the Cowgate, Grassmarket, and West Port. There he built up an intricate network of informers, acquiring especial knowledge of the common lodging houses regarded by contemporaries as hotbeds of criminality. Pawnbrokers and second-hand goods dealers, known in Edinburgh as brokers, constituted another crucial source of information. McLevy's Irish Catholic identity may have eased the cultivation of his contacts, often themselves Irish, but he was also skilled at cajoling witnesses into saying more than they intended. By the 1840s his extraordinary vigilance and energy were repeatedly acknowledged by the press. One newspaper called him &#145;the lynx-eyed McLevy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 16 Feb 1842), while the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span> went so far as to call him &#145;the Scottish Vidocq&#146;  (28 June 1849), drawing parallels with Eug&egrave;ne-Fran&ccedil;ois Vidocq, the legendary (if controversial) French detective who had founded the <i>brigade de s&ucirc;ret&eacute;</i> in 1812.<br>
<br>McLevy's talents and commitment were highly valued by Edinburgh's police authorities. This was shown in 1852 when his robust use of language towards an English tourist, arrested in the mistaken belief that he was part of the pocket-picking Swell Mob, resulted in a formal complaint to the lord provost. McLevy was exonerated on the grounds that his finer feelings had become &#145;blunted&#146; after so many years of pressure in the police service  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 11 Sept 1852). Conversely, in 1856 he was considered sufficiently presentable to provide evidence to a House of Commons select committee on the merits of the ticket-of-leave system for returned transportees from Britain's penal colonies. McLevy emphatically was not in favour of Edinburgh criminals, many of whom he had helped convict, being encouraged back to their old haunts  (&#145;Second report&#146;, 59&#150;61). In 1860, when the by now elderly detective sought leave to be released from active duty due to ill health, Lord Provost Francis Douglas Brown was effusive in his praise for McLevy's &#145;zeal&#146; and &#145;remarkable faculty for identifying thieves&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 30 May 1860). Although still nominally attached to the police force, he was granted a pension of 1 guinea per week.<br>
<br>With more spare time McLevy concentrated on completing a volume of reminiscences. <span class="italic">Curiosities of Crime in Edinburgh</span> appeared at the beginning of 1861, an accomplishment that was innovative for a detective officer in the British Isles. Priced at 2 shillings&#151;complete with portrait of an affable looking, balding man with side-whiskers&#151;the book quickly sold out and was immediately reprinted. McLevy selected twenty-eight investigations he had actively pursued since the 1830s and presented them in the form of dramatic set pieces. As many of the dates, locations, and protagonists can be verified, it seems likely that over the years he kept a scrapbook of the hundreds of newspaper reports about himself. However, McLevy embellished his sleuthing skills in order to enliven the narrative. A mystery remains about whether the writing was ghosted, perhaps by an obliging journalist; contemporaries certainly had their suspicions. Nevertheless, the down-to-earth essence of his personality shines through the fifty stories that were eventually published. They contain quirky humour, salty dialogue, feisty characters, and a relative absence of the moralizing often associated with mid-Victorian explorations of the criminal underclass.<br>
<br>Although a popular success, McLevy's first book was by no means universally acclaimed. Presbyterian and other Edinburgh evangelicals disliked his slyly irreverent allusions to their home missionary endeavours, and there was a sectarian edge to some of the criticism. In his second volume, <span class="italic">The Sliding Scale of Life</span> (1861), McLevy took a more sanguine approach to the efforts of religious reformers, while at the same time introducing Jean Brash, one of his most incorrigible and colourful adversaries from the 1840s. In the ingenuity of her thieving activities and entrapment of gullible men Jean was deemed to be beyond &#145;training in a ragged school&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sliding Scale</span>, 14). Yet despite a keen public appetite for such anecdotes, no further volume was forthcoming. During the 1860s McLevy's health deteriorated and chronic bronchitis and a heart condition eventually left him housebound. He died aged seventy-nine at his home, 5 South Richmond Street, Edinburgh, on 6 December 1873. He had longstanding ties with the city's Canongate district, and was buried at the cemetery there on 9 December.<br>
<br>After his death McLevy's memory was kept alive through the continuing popularity of his stories. These in turn inspired the exploits of James McGovan, a fictional Edinburgh detective created in the 1870s by William Crawford Honeyman. In 1975 the writer George Scott-Moncrieff was one of the first to suggest that McLevy and his <i>alter ego</i> McGovan had influenced the young Arthur Conan Doyle. Whatever the reality, in 1999 McLevy made the full transition to fictional sleuth, when the BBC broadcast the first in a series of radio dramas. The cat-loving, coffee connoisseur created by David Ashton quite deliberately bore scant resemblance to the real man, although elements from the original stories were woven into the plot lines. Following on from this success, the first of Ashton's McLevy novels appeared in 2006. Inevitably, literary celebrity has blurred the identity of the historical detective, but McLevy's career remains significant in its own right. He demonstrated shrewd awareness of his self-image and came to embody the vigilance of Edinburgh's police within the community. Latterly he was seen as an indispensable agent of law enforcement, confounding contemporary stereotypes about Irish migrants and criminality. In 2000 his legacy was recognized by Lothian and Borders police, when the annual McLevy trophy was first presented for the best detection work in the force.<br>
