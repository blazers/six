<span class="headword">Wetherell,  Nathaniel Thomas</span>  (1800&#150;1875), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 6 September 1800 at The Grove, Highgate, Middlesex, the seventh of the eight children of William Roundell Wetherell (1767/8&#150;1821), surgeon, and Anne Maria Gibson. He was educated in private schools and at the Middlesex Hospital. He became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1824 and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of London in 1828.<br>
<br>Wetherell's spare time was given to the study of the geology of north London. He visited railway cuttings, road excavations, and well sections, at Camden Town, Chalk Farm, Hampstead, and Highgate, where the London Clay was temporarily exposed, and amassed an exceptionally fine collection of fossils. He was a founder of the Palaeontographical Society and many of his specimens were illustrated in its monographs. By 1836 he had noticed a vertical change of fauna within the London Clay and proposed lower, middle, and upper divisions of that formation; one of the first English manifestations of the idea that lithological units could be further subdivided by fossils. On 20 March 1837 he married Louisa Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1819, <i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of William Robert Casson, at St Pancras Old Church.<br>
<br>Wetherell also studied the glacial drift deposits around Finchley and Muswell Hill and formed a collection of interesting specimens, particularly banded flints. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1832, left in 1856, rejoined in 1863, but finally resigned in December 1869 owing to deafness. His main collection was bought for the British Museum (Natural History) through James Tennant, a dealer, in 1871. This was added to earlier donations making the total number of specimens received from him almost 5000. Other specimens were donated to the Geological Survey's museum and Geological Society.<br>
<br>Wetherell was regarded by contemporaries as a caring, gentle, good, kind, modest, and unassuming Christian. He died, at his lifelong home, The Grove, Highgate, on 22 December 1875 owing to chronic enlargement of the prostate and exhaustion; he was buried on 29 December in the old burial-ground, Highgate. He was survived by his wife, the sole beneficiary of his will dated 3 August 1861, four sons, and three daughters.<br>
