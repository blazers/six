<span class="headword">Fawcett,  Percy Harrison</span>  (<em>b. </em>1867, <em>d.</em> in or after 1925), <span class="occ">soldier and explorer</span>, was born on 31 August 1867 at Devonia, Torquay, Devon, the son of Edward Boyd Fawcett (1839&#150;1884), of independent means, a noted amateur cricketer who had played for Cambridge University and Sussex, and his wife, Myra Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacDougall. Percy recalled a childhood &#145;devoid of parental affection&#146;, though he had some &#145;grand times&#146; with his elder brother (Edward) Douglas Fawcett (1866&#150;1960), later well known as a philosopher and mountaineer, and with his sisters  (Fawcett, <span class="italic">Exploration Fawcett</span>, 15&#150;16). He was educated at Newton School, Newton Abbott, &#145;with canings that did nothing to alter my outlook&#146;  (ibid.); then, destined for an army career, he was enrolled at Westminster School from June 1881 to April 1882. Cadet years at Woolwich led in 1886 to a commission in the Royal Artillery and his first posting to Trincomalee, in Ceylon, where he met his future wife, Nina Agnes (1870&#150;1954), the daughter of C. W. Paterson, a district judge at Galle, and widow of Captain Herbert Pritchard. He was back in Britain by the early 1890s, took a course of gunnery instruction at Shoeburyness, Essex, and was posted to Falmouth, Cornwall. On 26 January 1901 he and Nina were married at St Mathias's Church, Richmond, Surrey.<br>
<br>Fawcett was one of several undercover officers sent to Morocco, where the Foreign Office needed intelligence, to make traverses, noting the topography and agricultural features along their routes. His accounts of journeys between Mazagar and Morocco, and between Mogador and Morocco, appeared in the War Office's <span class="italic">Military Report on Morocco</span> (1903). There was a spell at Malta, where, assisted by his wife, he learned the basics of surveying before he undertook the War Office training on boundary survey and obtained a diploma. In 1902 he went east to Hong Kong, then to Ceylon, where his first son, Jack (<i>b</i>. 1903, <i>d</i>. in or after 1925), was born in Colombo on 19 May 1903. The following year, now promoted to major, he was posted to Spike Island, co. Cork, where he settled his family.<h2>
<a name="TheBolivianboundarycommission"></a>The Bolivian boundary commission</h2>The sale by the Bolivian government of a portion of territory to Brazil in 1903 resulted in the border between the two states being defined by the names of rivers whose exact courses and geographical positions were uncertain, an unsatisfactory situation in a region which was a source of rubber, gold, and diamonds, with the prospect of other economic minerals. In 1906 Fawcett was approached to serve as chief Bolivian commissioner, leading a survey party from the falls of the Rio Madeira to the source of the Rio Acre, then down the Abuna; the task was estimated to last three years. Fawcett was enthusiastic about the prospect of mapping this difficult forest terrain and its network of waterways. It was inhabited by hostile Indians who, fearing the slave raiders sent out by the rubber barons, were liable to attack all intruders, and by equally aggressive wildlife, mostly snakes and insects. He left his pregnant wife in Cork and sailed to the Pacific coast of Peru, where he landed on the day that his second son, Brian (<i>b</i>. 1906), was born; from there he made his way to La Paz, the Bolivian capital.<br>
<br>Fawcett's party set out for Lake Titicaca, on the Andean divide, and reached Cobija, where they found that the promised surveying instruments were not in place; Fawcett was obliged to rely on his own chronometer, compass, and sextant, as his plane table tripods had been in a case that was washed off the raft early in the journey. Some topographical work was, however, accomplished and on 26 December 1906 the party left Cobija and continued up the Acre to Riberalta. In October 1907 Fawcett was back at La Paz, where he handed over his reports to President Montes and accepted a further invitation to survey Bolivia's frontier with Brazil on the Rio Paraguay.<br>
<br>After spending some time at home with his family in Dawlish Warren, Devon, Fawcett left again in March 1908, sailing to Buenos Aires with his new assistant, F. G. Fisher. This time he was well provided with instruments, stores, and cash. They embarked on a river steamer for Asunci&oacute;n, intending to begin their survey at Corumb&aacute;. The Rio Verde was said to be the boundary, but it was unexplored and so Fawcett and Fisher set off with a small party, past Villa Bella do Matto Grosso. The flat-topped Ricardo Franco hills, when described later by Fawcett, inspired Conan Doyle's <span class="italic">The Lost World</span>, serialized in <span class="italic">The Strand</span> magazine in 1912. The Verde was found to follow a course some distance from that mapped when the boundary had been defined in 1873 and Fawcett's observations transferred some 1200 square miles to Bolivia.<br>
<br>Fawcett was next invited to survey the Bolivia&#150;Peru boundary; this was an exciting offer as it required exploration of the unknown upper reaches of the Rio Heath. Aware that he could not expect his secondment to be extended again, he resigned from the army two months before completing twenty years' service. He persuaded the British army to release three soldiers to join this third boundary survey, which left La Paz in 1911 and crossed the Aricoma Pass towards the Rio Heath. However, vague traditions of Inca remains began to tempt Fawcett away from the tedious business of surveying; back at La Paz in December he handed over his maps and submitted his resignation, before returning to Uplyme, Lyme Regis, where his family had settled.<h2>
<a name="Thesearchforlostcities"></a>The search for lost cities</h2>By 1913 the legends of inscribed monuments, gigantic crystals, and magical sources of light, coupled with the lure of exploring on the Bolivian side of the border with Brazil, had coalesced into what Fawcett, convinced by Indian stories of hidden cities and fair-skinned tribes, came to regard as &#145;the Quest&#146;. There was talk of setting up a mining concession, funded by a London syndicate, and he spent several months in the area. He had nearly reached the Brazilian border when news of the outbreak of the First World War reached him. His party retraced their route and by January 1915 he was back in uniform and awaiting a posting to France, where he spent eighteen months in the trenches. Promoted lieutenant-colonel, he was active with the 158th brigade of the Royal Field Artillery in 1916, was slightly gassed after Christmas, and the following year was with the 6th corps of heavy artillery. In February 1919 he returned to his family, now settled at Marrick, in the Devon village of Seaton, where his sons went to school.<br>
<br>With an army pension of &pound;150 Fawcett decided that all hope for the future lay in the New World. After sending his wife and children to Jamaica, he went to Brazil, where he arrived in Rio in February 1920. In the national library he discovered an old Portuguese book with an account of a large, hidden, and very ancient city, without inhabitants, discovered in 1753. The Brazilian government agreed to fund the cost of an expedition, though Fawcett would not receive a salary. By this time the Foreign Office and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) were irritated by his insistent requests for money; on 10 March 1920 Sir John Keltie, secretary of the RGS, wrote to the diplomat Sir Maurice de Bunsen:<blockquote>It is quite true that [Fawcett] has a reputation of being difficult to get on with, and has a queer manner in many ways, being a mystic and a spiritualist, but all the same he has an extraordinary power of getting through difficulties that would deter anybody else. (Fawcett MSS, box 1/81)</blockquote>In August 1920 Fawcett departed for the town of Cuiab&agrave;, in the state of Mato Grosso. He intended to spend eighteen months in the forest and emerge on one of the great rivers, from where the party's return would be straightforward. However, they suffered a series of setbacks and made for Corumb&aacute;, on the border with Bolivia, where Fawcett decided to stay until February 1921. He next made several journeys in the dry country between the Rio S&atilde;o Francisco and the Atlantic coast, before he re-equipped and, with two mules, set off alone into the interior. He emerged claiming to have found enough to make it imperative to go again, although he never disclosed the nature of these finds.<br>
<br>Contemporary discoveries excited Fawcett's fanciful ideas about the past history of South America. His objective was now &#145;Z&#146;, the hidden city discovered in 1753. He was reluctant to disclose his plans, but in order to raise funds he described a proposed route commencing at Dead Horse Camp&#151;so named because his horse had died there in 1921&#151;at 11&deg;43' S, 54&deg;35' W. Heading north-east to the Rio Xing&ugrave;, he would visit a reported ancient stone tower, the terror of the local Indians because at night light blazed out from the doors and windows. He would head through the forest to a point between the Xing&ugrave; and the Araguya, following the watershed north to 9&deg; or 10&deg; S. On the high ground between the states of Bahia and Goias, which was unexplored, he expected to find traces of old cities. He would continue along the mountains between the states of Bahia and Piaui to the S&atilde;o Francisco and expected to come upon the city reported in 1753 at approximately 11&deg;30' S, 42&deg;30' W. He would come out by the railway running to Salvador. This was a remarkably precise route for someone who intended to keep his goal secret, but he was mistaken in claiming that the region was unexplored; indeed Fawcett himself had conversed with a Frenchman who claimed, truthfully, to be familiar with it, but Fawcett chose to disbelieve him.<br>
<br>Since his return in 1921 to Britain, where his family, not having settled in Jamaica, had set up house at Stoke Canon, Devon, Fawcett had been fretting over the delays in getting his expedition under way. He and his wife became increasingly interested in occult sciences, compiling notes on their relevance in his quest. He set about raising funds from the RGS and elsewhere for an expedition to consist of Fawcett, his son Jack, and an old schoolfriend, Raleigh Rimell. Much was made of the young men's suitability for this trip, with physical fitness being seen as less important than the fact that they were not attracted to alcohol, tobacco, or sex.<br>
<br>In 1924 he travelled to New York, where he managed to raise funds from the National Geographic and other societies, and by selling the newspaper rights to the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). The party sailed from New York in February 1925 for Rio, then on the familiar route to Cuiab&agrave;. After buying horses and mules, and &#145;fattening up&#146; in preparation for some hungry days ahead, they set out. From time to time they would send chatty letters home or Fawcett would take photographs of Indians for NANA, as the party made good progress. Fawcett's last letter, sent from Dead Horse Camp on 29 May 1925, after their Brazilian assistants had been sent back, assured his wife &#145;you need have no fear of failure&#146;  (Fawcett, <span class="italic">Exploration Fawcett</span>). The party then vanished without trace.<h2>
<a name="Theexpeditionsafterlife"></a>The expedition's afterlife</h2>From Brazil there were, inevitably, rumours of meetings and finds, several of which Fawcett's surviving son, Brian, employed by the Peruvian central Railway, was able to investigate. The first news came from Roger Courteville, a French civil engineer. He and his wife had crossed from Atlantic to Pacific by car and in the state of Minas Gerais had come across an old, ragged, and sick man who said he was Fawcett. Nina Fawcett, who was still receiving her husband's meagre War Office pension as a wife and not a widow, came to believe this story and tried to persuade Brian to raise funds and return to find him. This came to nothing.<br>
<br>In 1928 NANA organized a search party led by US navy commander George Dyott which discovered a metal uniform case with a maker's tag, but this was identified as having been discarded by Fawcett in 1920. The Indian tribe where it was found reported a white man and two younger men, both lame; they had taken them over the river to a village of Kalapalo Indians from where the white men had continued east and the smoke of their camp fires had been seen for a further five days. In 1930 another expedition reached this Kalapalo village but failed to return. An unsuccessful British expedition in 1932 was described by Peter Fleming in his book <span class="italic">Brazilian Adventure</span> (1933). In 1932 Stefan Rattin, a Swiss trapper, came out of Mato Grosso with a story of an elderly Fawcett held captive by Indians, but Brian was not inclined to believe that his father, bald for many years, was now the old man with long white hair and other features that Rattin had described. Other reports of sightings of white men or artefacts belonging to them came to the RGS or the family, but were all disproved.<br>
<br>Fawcett's will was proved on 31 August 1937, by which time there was no longer any likelihood of his being alive. In 1951 some more tangible evidence appeared: Orlando Vilas Boas, a Brazilian working with the Indian Foundation, had heard a deathbed confession by Izarari, a Kalapalo chief, that he had clubbed the three white men to death, the culmination of an incident involving Jack Fawcett and Izarari's wife and a subsequent argument over the provision of canoes, when the elder Fawcett had slapped the Indian's face. The two young men's bodies were thrown in the river but Izarari's son was persuaded to show where Fawcett was buried. Some bones were sent to London and examined at the Royal Anthropological Institute, but their dimensions and dental features proved that this was not Percy Fawcett. Nina Fawcett, who since her husband's disappearance had lived with their daughter at Beaulieu-sur-Mer, France, and then Baugy-sur-Clarens, Switzerland, died at Brighton, Sussex, on 8 September 1954.<br>
<br>Fawcett's city &#145;Z&#146; has never been seen from the ground or from aeroplanes which fly regularly across the area. It seems probable that the story arose from sightings of an eroded line of limestone hills, which from a distance appear like some ruined city.<br>
