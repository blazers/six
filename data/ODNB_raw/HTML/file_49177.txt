<span class="headword">Reynolds,  John Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1927), <span class="occ">promoter of technological education</span>, was born in Salford, Lancashire, on 8 February 1842, the son and eldest of eleven children of John Reynolds, a bootmaker, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hilton. He attended the Lower Mosley Street day school of the Cross Street Unitarian Chapel and, for one year, Manchester grammar school. At twelve he was apprenticed bootmaker to his father and also became a pupil teacher at the chapel's Sunday school. Here he met William Fairbairn, the Revd William Gaskell, and other leading Unitarians. Apart from a course at Owens College, he was self-educated from this time onward. On 19 August 1868 he married Ellen Ferguson at Cross Street Chapel; they had three children.<br>
<br>In 1879 Reynolds was appointed secretary to the Manchester Mechanics' Institution, which by the 1870s survived mainly by providing elementary school classes. But increasing support for primary education from municipal and other sources had greatly reduced the demand for this service; by 1879 it was clearly in decline. To his new task Reynolds brought vision, administrative skills, integrity (a quality some of his predecessors lacked), and powers of persuasion&#151;gifts made the more effective by his enthusiasm for his work. Within a year he had devised a full programme for the survival and future development of the institution. By this time the need for better technical education was widely recognized. In July 1882 it was decided to transform the institution into a technical school.<br>
<br>In 1887 Reynolds admitted that Manchester was in the third class of English towns in its provision of technical education  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Manchester Statistical Society</span>, 1887, 118&#150;9). He worked hard to set high standards and to recruit the best-qualified staff for the new school, of which he was the principal. Fortunately, money was becoming available. The new City and Guilds of London Institute was one source of funds, while the acts of 1889 and 1890 empowered local authorities to support technical education. Accordingly, the city took over the Manchester Technical School, now renamed the Municipal Technical School. At the same time Reynolds became secretary of the Manchester corporation technical instruction committee and director of technical instruction. In that capacity he, with members of the committee, visited the technological schools of Europe in 1891 and 1897 (see his published reports). The fine buildings and lavish equipment they saw, particularly in Germany and Switzerland, impressed everyone. Accommodation in Manchester was quite inadequate: Reynolds had had to arrange courses in widely dispersed buildings. In 1898 he toured the United States and Canada on another fact-finding mission, of which he published a report.<br>
<br>Following a grant of land by the Whitworth Institute, what was claimed to be the finest technical college in Britain was built on Sackville Street, Manchester. It was opened in 1902 by the prime minister and renamed the Municipal School of Technology. Reynolds continued in office as principal and as director for higher education in Manchester. In that year the (federal) Victoria University awarded him an honorary MSc.<br>
<br>In the following year Owens College became the autonomous Victoria University of Manchester. Under Reynolds's supervision several courses had reached university standard, and it was agreed that the new university would establish a faculty of technology in the school (1904). Reynolds became dean of the new faculty, with a seat on the senate. Although ten members of staff had been designated professors by the school, there was room for only three on the university senate. These professors and their staffs, also recognized by the university, were paid by the city. However, most of the school's efforts were devoted to part-time and evening classes. As C. H. Herford remarked, many were involved in this development but it was the idealism, the initiative, and the driving power of J. H. Reynolds that made it possible.<br>
<br>After Reynolds retired in 1912 development of the school was less rapid, and it was only in the era of Dr Bowden that development rivalled that of Reynolds's day. It is now, as the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), an autonomous university (1994). It is doubtful if Reynolds would have approved of the ending, in 1956, of part-time and evening courses: these, after all, involved intimate links with local industry and with the wider community, links that he, a Manchester radical, held most important. Reynolds spent his last years at Cheadle Hulme. He died on 17 July 1927 while on holiday in Anglesey and was cremated at the southern cemetery, Manchester.<br>
