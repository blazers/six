<span class="headword">Rackett,  Thomas</span>  (1755&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was the son of Thomas Rackett of Wandsworth, Surrey, and Marie Caillouel. His mother belonged to a Huguenot family who settled in England in 1685. From an early age he displayed a remarkable talent in natural history, music, and drawing. At fourteen he impressed David Garrick with his ability to recite in public, and received from him a folio copy of Shakespeare with a laudatory inscription. George Romney's full-length portrait shows the youthful Rackett declaiming his ode on stage. He matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 16 November 1773, graduated BA in 1777, and proceeded MA in 1780. On 26 December 1780 he became rector of Spetisbury with Charlton-Marshall, near Blandford Forum in Dorset, and held the living for sixty years. On 31 July 1781 he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of the Revd Thomas Tattersall, rector of St Paul's, Covent Garden, and Streatham.<br>
<br>Spetisbury provided Rackett with a handsome living worth &pound;750 per annum and a splendid parsonage house built in 1716 at a cost of &pound;1000. His parochial duties were not onerous, and he was able to pursue his many interests with zeal. He travelled widely throughout the western counties studying burial-mounds, and was often accompanied by his daughter Dorothea. In 1794 and 1796 he toured the west country collecting minerals with Thomas Hatchett FRS and Dr Maton MD, physician to Queen Charlotte. He was an active member of the Linnean Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the Royal Society, and a corresponding member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Statistique Universelle. He contributed several very fine drawings to the second edition of John Hutchins's <span class="italic">History of Dorset</span>. Rackett was an avid collector throughout his life and the county record office in Dorchester contains a large collection of his documents, while the county museum houses his splendid collection of Greek coins found in the British Isles. His manuscripts reveal his interest in subjects as diverse as electricity and magnetism, gas lighting, perpetual motion, genealogy, heraldry, agriculture, botany, trigonometry, overseas trade, French politics, salt manufacture, and dry rot in ships. He corresponded with a wide range of people, among them Mrs Garrick, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Tiberius Cavallo, Richard Gough, and Mrs Siddons, and wrote to people as far afield as India, Moscow, Nova Scotia, Boston, and Cape Town.<br>
<br>Rackett's many activities and lengthy periods in London led to the accusation by the marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords in a debate on Roman Catholic emancipation in 1829 that his parish was being neglected. Rackett admitted that his absence had occasionally been longer than the period &#145;allowed by Law&#146;  (letter to bishop of Bristol, Rackett MSS, D/RAC bundle 66), but claimed that he had resided in Spetisbury &#145;for a considerable part of every year for the last 40 years&#146;  (Dorset RO, photocopy 267), and his curate lived only 1&frac12; miles away. The bishop of Bristol accepted his explanation and wrote to Lansdowne in Rackett's defence. The accusation was subsequently dropped.<br>
<br>Dorothy Rackett died, aged eighty-one, in June 1835 and was buried in Spetisbury churchyard on 17 June. Thomas Rackett died at Spetisbury on 29 November 1840, aged nearly eighty-five, and was buried with his wife on 5 December. They are commemorated with a large pyramidical monument in Spetisbury churchyard, though the dates inscribed do not correspond with the parish register entries.<br>
