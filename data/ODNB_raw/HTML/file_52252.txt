<span class="headword">Wesel,  Gerhard  von</span>  (<em>c.</em>1443&#150;1510), <span class="occ">merchant and administrator</span>, was the second of three sons of the Cologne merchant Hermann von Wesel (<i>d</i>. 1484) and his wife, Kathrinchen. Of Gerhard's education it is only known that he matriculated at the University of Cologne while still a minor (not yet fourteen) in 1457. Although Gerhard later spoke and wrote German, Latin, and English, and owned books in German and Latin, he was not marked out for a clerical or academic career, but followed in his father's footsteps. He was married three times: his first wife was Gertrud von Merle, whom he married before 1468; they had a daughter, Gertrud, who married a Cologne merchant, Konrad Rinck. Gertrud died on 8 August 1483. There were no children of either his second marriage, to Elisabeth Glidermann, whom he married late in 1483 and who died on 1 January 1486, or his third, to Adelheid Bischoff, whom he married in February 1489; she died after 27 July 1518. Gerhard von Wesel traded initially in his father's name, later on his own, along the main artery of Cologne's international commerce (Frankfurt&#150;Cologne&#150;Burgundy&#150;London).<br>
<br>Like his father von Wesel was a member of the Cologne town council. Co-opted for the first time on 24 June 1481, he served the usual one-year term eight times between 1487&#150;8 and 1508&#150;9. In this urban context he was to enjoy a distinguished career, serving during the same period, usually more than once, in a wide variety of administrative, judicial, fiscal, and military offices, and being four times chosen mayor of Cologne, for the years 1494&#150;5, 1497&#150;8, 1502&#150;3, and 1507&#150;8. In addition von Wesel represented Cologne at the reform diet of Worms (1495), which Maximilian I, the king of the Romans (<i>r</i>. 1493&#150;1519), opened with an urgent request for an emergency loan&#151;to be repaid from the proceeds of an imperial poll tax (<i>gemeiner pfennig</i>)&#151;in order to repel the French invasion of Italy. A committee of estates was formed to apportion the loan, and the imperial towns elected von Wesel and the mayor of Augsburg as their representatives. The proposal put forward by the princes on the committee proved explosive: not only the towns, but also the <i>geselschaften</i> in the empire, were to pay up. The phrase was ominous: did the <i>geselschaften</i> include mercantile corporations (in which case the towns would be subject doubly), or did the princes only have knights' organizations in mind? Von Wesel and his colleague demanded clarification, and, when their worst fears proved to be correct, persuaded the committee to drop the notion of taxing the <i>geselschaften</i> and so reduce the towns' burden. The real issue was not the towns' reluctance to pay an ever-increasing share of imperial expenses (although that was certainly a factor), but rather the need for constitutional reform of the empire, which would reduce the power of the monarchy by establishing and funding independent institutions answerable to the estates.<br>
<br>Von Wesel's role in English history had begun many years earlier. For almost a century Anglo-Hanseatic tension had built up over the issue of reciprocal rights. English merchants, who controlled Anglo-Prussian trade but still lacked a firm legal footing, demanded rights in Prussia equivalent to those enjoyed by the Hanse in England. While these demands were satisfied by the treaty of London (1437), Prussia's refusal to ratify the treaty led to a sustained campaign by the English crown, which twice (in 1442 and 1447) suspended Hanseatic privileges in England. Each time Cologne, whose merchants suffered disproportionately, managed to rescue the situation. Edward IV used different tactics, and only granted the Hanse members the use of their rights for a limited period, making confirmation of their charters dependent upon negotiations on reciprocity. Cologne, whose merchants had much to lose from any disruption of trade with England, led all the Hanseatic diplomatic efforts. In 1468, in a separate incident, the Danish king seized six English ships bound for Danzig as a reprisal for the depredations of English merchants in Iceland. Since the English had no hope of compensation from the Danes, they decided to use the incident for a different purpose. Seizing upon the fact that Danzig ships and seamen had been involved, they petitioned the crown to arrest all Hanseatic merchants in England and sequester their goods.<br>
<br>When this storm broke in late July 1468, Gerhard von Wesel was acting alderman of the Steelyard (the Hanseatic headquarters in London), all the senior members having left for the continent at Easter. It was a terrible responsibility for a young man. While Gerhard led all the delegations to plead the Steelyard's case before the council, and took the lead in preparing its legal defence, he came under increasing pressure from Cologne to avoid entanglement in the difficulties of the eastern Hanse members. Cologne felt&#151;with considerable justification&#151;that since the 1440s its merchants had been made to bear the consequences of the rash actions of Danzig and L&uuml;beck. If these hotheads had picked yet another quarrel with England, then they should resolve the difficulties they had brought upon themselves, without expecting Cologne to follow their lead or foot the bill. Von Wesel was initially loath to accept this view, though he must have been tempted, as the crown clearly favoured Cologne: while Hanse members had been imprisoned in July 1468 and condemned to pay compensation of &pound;20,000 by the council in November 1468, Cologne merchants had been released from custody and acquitted. Nevertheless, von Wesel loyally acted in the interest of the imprisoned Hanse merchants until the spring of 1469, when he came around to the position of his elders in Cologne. On 16 May 1469, shortly after the Hanseatic diet had ordered a complete break with England, a separate Cologne Steelyard was constituted with von Wesel at its head. In that capacity he was instrumental in obtaining privileges for the Cologne merchants, and he continued to preside over the Cologne Steelyard until it became clear that its final act was being played out. Charles the Bold of Burgundy had used his good offices to establish diplomatic contacts between England and the Hanse, and in 1474 the treaty of Utrecht resolved the crisis in Anglo-Hanseatic relations. However, Edward IV was forced to break with Cologne, which&#151;as von Wesel noted bitterly&#151;had loyally supported him. The treaty and a separate note obliged the crown to deny Hanseatic rights to Cologne, which had been expelled from the Hanse in 1471. Despite his bitterness at Edward's breach of faith, von Wesel seriously considered becoming an English subject and a London citizen, should Cologne remain estranged from the Hanse.<br>
<br>In the end events drove Cologne and the Hanse into one another's arms, and Cologne was readmitted in the concord of Bremen of 1476. However, the Steelyard could not bring itself to readmit Gerhard von Wesel, who was hated with particular venom. It required considerable efforts to overcome this enmity, but in the end von Wesel was successful, and in 1479 was allowed back, though he remained wary as late as 1487. Gradually, however, the bitterness faded, and the Hanse came to appreciate his expert knowledge of English affairs and his wide circle of powerful English friends. Until his death he was crucially involved in every round of Anglo-Hanseatic negotiations (at Antwerp in 1491 and 1497 and at Bruges in 1499). Thereafter von Wesel withdrew from international politics, though he remained active in the administration of Cologne. He died there on 4 September 1510 and was buried in the St Vincent Chapel of the Augustinian monastery in Cologne.<br>
