<span class="headword">Bentinck,  Ruth Mary  Cavendish-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ruth Mary St Maur]</span>  (1867&#150;1953), <span class="occ">women's suffragist and socialist</span>, was born in Tangier on 21 October 1867, the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49739/', "Edward Adolphus Ferdinand St Maur, Earl St Maur (1835&#150;1869)")</script>, eldest son of the twelfth duke of Somerset [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25164/', "St Maur, Edward Adolphus")</script>], and Rosina Elizabeth Swan (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of a bricklayer and a Gypsy. Shortly after her birth she and her mother were brought to England. In 1869 her father died of a lung tumour, and Rosina and her children (she had given birth to a son, Richard Harold, in 1869) came under the care of the duke and duchess of Somerset. In 1872 Rosina married Fran&ccedil;ois Tournier of Bordeaux, but died shortly afterwards of consumption. The children became the informally adopted wards of their Somerset grandparents (the relationship was also acknowledged in their surname, St Maur), living with them mainly at Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire, Stover Lodge in Devon, and in London. Although suffering the social stigma of illegitimacy, Ruth received a good private education and was introduced into aristocratic society.<br>
<br>In 1885 the duke died, leaving Ruth St Maur a fortune of &pound;80,000, and she went to live with her aunt, Lady Guendolen Ramsden, in Upper Brook Street, Mayfair. She began to take an interest in social questions at this time, and in the condition of the poor. In 1887 she made her d&eacute;but in society, creating a stir by her combination of wealth, striking good looks, and outspoken wit, which did much to overcome the disadvantages of her birth. In the course of her first season she met, and on 8 August 1887 married, (William George) Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck (1856&#150;1948), barrister, a great-grandson of the third duke of Portland. The young couple received the castle on Brownsea Island as a wedding present; they travelled widely in Europe and the Mediterranean, and after a period of financial difficulty consequent on the death of Frederick's father, settled at 78 Harley Street, a house owned by Frederick's wealthy benefactor and cousin Lucy, Lady Howard de Walden. They continued to travel and to visit widely among friends and relatives, meeting both royalty and Fabian socialists.<br>
<br>Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck grew increasingly active politically, becoming involved with a girls' club in the East End of London, supporting the Bryant and May matchgirls' strike, and helping Beatrice Webb with the reform of the poor law. She came to know Beatrice and Sidney Webb closely, and was a friend of Keir Hardie and R. B. Cunninghame Graham, as well as many other socialists. She contributed to such papers as the <span class="italic">Socialist Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, and took a strong radical line over such matters as the South African War and Lloyd George's budget, as well as being a confirmed anti-vaccinationist. Her labour movement activities involved her particularly with the Women's Trade Union League, and later the National Federation of Women Workers, and in 1911 she helped Ben Tillett organize the dockers' strike. At the same time she continued to move in high society, although she did not always meet with its approval, particularly on the part of her husband's family (her husband remained a lifelong Conservative). Her attitudes in this respect always remained contradictory.<br>
<br>Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck also became increasingly active in the campaign for women's suffrage. In this she was to some extent following in family tradition: Caroline Norton, the campaigner for married women's rights, was a great-aunt, and Lady Guendolen Ramsden was also a supporter of women's suffrage. Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck's main sympathies came to lie with the militant Women's Social and Political Union, and she frequently spoke publicly and demonstrated on their behalf, on one occasion parading between sandwich-boards outside the House of Commons. However, she herself was never actually arrested for militant action, and she did maintain friendly relations with non-militants. In 1913, with Florence de Fonblanque, she founded the Qui Vive Corps, which was intended to be a sort of suffragist &#145;flying squad&#146;, with its own uniform (brown with a green cockade and badge). Members were pledged to turn out at any time to support suffrage activity, but without the use of militant tactics. It is unclear how active this organization proved to be.<br>
<br>In 1909 Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck established the Cavendish-Bentinck Library as a subscription library for suffragists, collecting not only feminist classics and works of antiquarian interest, but up-to-the minute publications such as Havelock Ellis's <span class="italic">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</span> (the future Lord Rhondda, being unable because of censorship to buy a copy, had to ask his daughter, a member of the Cavendish-Bentinck Library, to borrow it for him). The library eventually became part of the Women's Service Library (now the Women's Library), and Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck maintained an active interest in it until her death.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck campaigned for women's war work, although she was highly critical of the war mentality; her elder son was severely wounded at Mons. After the war she became an enthusiastic supporter of the Soviet Union, especially in the 1930s, when she joined with Beatrice Webb in demonstrating the necessity and legitimacy of the Moscow trials; the Nazi&#150;Soviet pact of 1939&#150;41 appears to have shaken her confidence in Stalin only briefly. In the Second World War she and her husband had to move out of their Harley Street house into a flat, but otherwise suffered little. Despite differences in temperament and politics they had been a devoted couple. However, after the war her husband's health declined, and he died in 1948. Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck survived him by five years, dying at her home, 36 Harley House, Marylebone Road, London, on 28 January 1953. She was survived by four children (a fifth had died in infancy); her elder son eventually became the eighth duke of Portland and was succeeded by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40203/', "Victor Frederick William Cavendish-Bentinck (1897&#150;1990)")</script>.<br>
