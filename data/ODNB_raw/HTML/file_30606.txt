<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barnes,  Robert</span>  (1817&#150;1907), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born in Norwich on 4 September 1817, the second of the six children of Philip Barnes (1791&#150;1874), an architect and one of the founders of the Royal Botanic Society of London, and his wife, Harriet Futter, daughter of a Norfolk squire. His father claimed to be a descendant of Robert Barnes (<i>c</i>.1495&#150;1540), the sixteenth-century heretic. After education at Bruges from 1826 to 1830 and at home, where one of his tutors was George Borrow, author of <span class="italic">The Bible in Spain</span>, at the age of fifteen Barnes began his medical training as an apprentice in Norwich to Richard Griffin, the founder of an association of Poor Law medical officers. When Barnes's family moved to London he continued his medical studies at University College, the Windmill Street School, and at St George's Hospital. After qualifying MRCS in 1842, he went to Paris, where he pursued his interest in mental illness. On his return to London a year later he applied without success for the post of resident physician at Bethlem Hospital; he thus settled in general practice in Notting Hill, supplementing his income by means of literary work for <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. In 1848 he graduated MD (London), and he became LRCP in 1853 and FRCP in 1859.<br>
<br>Barnes's ambition, however, was to be a medical teacher. After holding minor posts in London as obstetric surgeon to the Western General Dispensary and as lecturer on midwifery at the Great Windmill Street School of Medicine and on forensic medicine at Dermott's School, on 1 April 1859 he was elected assistant obstetric physician, and on 14 July 1863 obstetric physician to the London Hospital. He was also appointed physician to the Seamen's Hospital, the East London Hospital for Children, and the Royal Maternity Hospital. In April 1862 Barnes was invited to fill the post of lecturer on midwifery at St Thomas's Hospital, and on 24 April 1865 he was elected obstetric physician to that hospital. He was dean of St Thomas's medical school when he left in 1875 to take up a post as obstetric physician at St George's Hospital; in 1885 he was elected consulting obstetric physician there. He was also physician to the Chelsea Hospital for Women.<br>
<br>Barnes was actively involved in medical politics. He took a prominent part in the foundation of the Obstetrical Society of London in 1859 and was president in 1865&#150;6. In 1876, as one of the examiners for the midwifery licence of the Royal College of Surgeons, he refused to examine Sophia Jex-Blake and her friends, who were trying to gain access to medicine by exploiting a loophole in the regulations for the licence. In 1884 a dispute with the council of the Obstetrical Society of London led him to found the British Gynaecological Society, of which he was honorary president until his death. A pioneer of operative gynaecology, Barnes strenuously advocated the right of obstetricians to perform ovariotomy and other major gynaecological operations, but the Obstetrical Society of London had no sympathy for his cause. Ovariotomy was a controversial procedure and older obstetricians, notably James Matthews Duncan, a rival of Barnes both in debates and in practice, firmly believed that such operations were beyond the scope of obstetrics. The cause Barnes advocated eventually gained the day, and he lived to see the two societies united and merged into the Royal Society of Medicine (1907).<br>
<br>A leading teacher and gynaecologist, Barnes was censor at the Royal College of Physicians (1877&#150;8) and he had the rare distinction of receiving the honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1883; he was also honorary fellow of the Medical Society of London (1893) and of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society (1905). He delivered the Lettsomiam lectures at the Medical Society of London in 1858 and the Lumleian lectures &#145;On convulsive diseases in women&#146; at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1873. He was one of the first to take an interest in the histopathology of the female reproductive system, and gave his name to an obstetric instrument and to a curve of the pelvis. Besides writing an official report on scurvy at the Seamen's Hospital (1864) and contributing many papers to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Obstetrical Society of London</span> and to the <span class="italic">British Gynaecological Journal</span>, Barnes was the author of standard works on obstetrics and gynaecology. His collected <span class="italic">Lectures on Obstetric Operations, Including the Treatment of Haemorrhages</span> (1870) established his fame and were translated into French. <span class="italic">A Clinical History of the Medical and Surgical Diseases of Women</span> (1873), a classic in the literature of obstetric medicine, was followed by <span class="italic">A System of Obstetric Medicine and Surgery</span> (2 vols., 1884), written with his son, Fancourt Barnes.<br>
<br>Barnes was twice married, first to Eliza Fawkener, daughter of a London solicitor; second, in 1880, to Alice Maria, daughter of Captain W. G. Hughes, of Carmarthenshire, deputy lieutenant and JP for that county. With his first wife he had one son, R. S. Fancourt Barnes, a loyal supporter and collaborator, and two daughters; with his second wife he had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Barnes was an energetic man with a reputation for bellicosity. He forcefully defended his opinions, and in the process he made many enemies. Intellectually and physically vigorous to the end, he impressed his contemporaries by learning Spanish at the age of eighty-five, and by rowing out to sea and bathing from the boat daily until he was eighty-nine. He was a director of the Prudential Assurance Company (1848&#150;9; 1884&#150;1907), accumulated a large fortune, and gave generously to medical institutions. He died at his home, Bernersmede, in Eastbourne on 12 May 1907, of cerebral thrombosis, and was buried at Eastbourne on 16 May.<br>
