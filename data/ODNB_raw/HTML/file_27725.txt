<span class="headword">Trevor,  George</span>  (1809&#150;1888), <span class="occ">writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Bridgwater, Somerset, on 30 January 1809, the sixth son of Charles Trevor, a customs officer. His paternal grandmother, Harriet, was the sister of Horatio and James Smith, the authors of <span class="italic">Rejected Addresses</span> (1812). Trevor was educated at a day school at Bridgwater, and in 1825 entered the East India Company office in London as a clerk; there he was contemporary with John Stuart Mill. In London he made the acquaintance of the Disraeli family. On 6 February 1832 he matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, managing to keep his terms while discharging his duties as clerk. He was a prominent speaker at the Oxford Union, where he caused a furore in 1835 by accusing the treasurer, Edward Cardwell, of falsifying the accounts&#151;a charge he was forced to withdraw. On 12 July 1836 Trevor married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of Christopher Garrick of Richmond, Surrey, the grandson of George Garrick, brother of David Garrick. They had several children.<br>
<br>Having resigned his clerkship the previous year, Trevor was ordained priest in 1836, and in order to qualify for an East India chaplaincy took an honorary fourth class in civil law. That year he was assigned to the Madras establishment, and from 1837 to 1845 ministered at Bangalore, where he built St Paul's Church and founded a Tamil mission.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Trevor graduated BA in 1846 (MA, 1847) and was appointed resident deputy of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the province of York. In 1847 he was instituted rector of All Saints', Pavement, York, and at the same time received a non-residentiary canonry in the cathedral, with the prebendal stall of Apesthorp. In 1850 he was appointed by the burgesses of Sheffield to be chaplain of their parish church, and took up his residence in the town. He was, however, prevented from preaching in the church by successive vicars, Thomas Sutton and Thomas Sale, who were suspicious of his high-church views on sacramental theology. Responding to their suspicions, he asserted his Anglican orthodoxy in a series of lectures on the Reformation, which drew large crowds. Although his right to the chaplaincy and its endowments was established by proceedings in chancery and the queen's bench, he remained barred from the pulpit and returned to York in 1855.<br>
<br>Since 1847, when he was elected proctor for the chapter of York, Trevor had taken a leading part in the movement for the revival of the northern convocation, whose meetings had become a mere formality, thus depriving the clergy of a forum for debate. His work on the history of the two convocations (<span class="italic">The convocation of the two provinces, their origin, constitution, and forms of proceeding, with a chapter on their revival</span>, 1852) had considerable influence on clerical opinion, but progress was blocked during the lifetime of Archbishop Thomas Musgrave (1788&#150;1860). The northern convocation finally met on 23 March 1861, and Trevor was appointed synodal secretary the following year. He did much to make the revived body broadly representative.<br>
<br>Trevor was a forceful and popular preacher, but in his latter years at All Saints' found his congregation drawn off by the rival attraction of the services in the minster. In 1868 he retired to the living of Burton Pidsea in Holderness, and in 1871 was translated to the rectory of Beeford. In 1874 he was made an honorary DD by Holy Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, in recognition of his work <span class="italic">The Catholic Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist</span> (1869; 2nd enlarged edn, 1875), a vindication of the older high-church doctrine. A prolific author, Trevor also wrote three works on India, as well as books on the history of Egypt, Rome, and Russia. He was a contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> from as early as 1833, and was well known for his articles in the national press. In 1886 he was made an honorary DD by the University of Durham.<br>
<br>Trevor died on 18 June 1888 at the rectory of his son, George Wilberforce Trevor, at Marton, near Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, and was buried at Beeford. A memorial tablet was erected to his memory in the north aisle of the choir of York Minster where he had been a canon for forty-one years.<br>
