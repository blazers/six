<span class="headword">Riviere,  Briton</span>  (1840&#150;1920), <span class="occ">painter</span>, the youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23695/', "William Riviere (1806&#150;1876)")</script> and his wife, Ann, daughter of Joseph Jarvis of Atherstone, Warwickshire, was born in London on 14 August 1840. His father and grandfather and many of the Riviere family, who claimed Huguenot descent, were artists. William Riviere became drawing-master at Cheltenham College, Gloucestershire, where Riviere himself was educated from 1851 to 1859. The move in 1851 from London to the Cotswolds interrupted his habit of sketching animals at London Zoo, but by 1851 and 1852 he was exhibiting oil paintings of kittens at the British Institution.<br>
<br>In 1859&#151;the second year in which Riviere had exhibited at the Royal Academy&#151;the family moved to Oxford, where his father established an art college. Riviere took a BA degree at St Mary Hall in 1866; he received an MA in 1873 and was awarded the honorary degree of DCL in 1891. His academic results were achieved through private tuition rather than by attending university lectures, which were inclined to disturb his artistic studies. While at Oxford he came under the influence of Clarence Dobell, whose sister Mary Alice (the daughter of John Dobell, wine merchant) he was to marry on 6 August 1867. Dobell introduced Riviere into the outer circles of the Pre-Raphaelites, and in the early 1860s he switched his style of painting to emulate that of John Everett Millais. His <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> was accepted in 1864 by the Royal Academy, but <span class="italic">Hamlet and Ophelia</span> and others in this style were not. He turned his hand to sculpture but, by the late 1860s, having failed to earn a living, he was forced to do decorative initials for <span class="italic">Punch</span> and book illustrations for magazines such as <span class="italic">Good Words</span>.<br>
<br>After his marriage Riviere moved to Kent and reverted to his previous practice of animal painting, which remained his leading preoccupation for the rest of his life. Under the influence of the Scottish landscape painters, his treatment of colour improved rapidly. As an animal painter he was heir to the tradition of Sir Edwin Landseer, though he generally eschewed Landseer's tendency to heavy anthropomorphism. A sequence of animal paintings exhibited at the Royal Academy assured his growing fame: in 1871 he exhibited <span class="italic">Circe</span>, in 1872 <span class="italic">Daniel</span> (of which a second version of 1890 is in Manchester City Galleries), and in 1878 <span class="italic">Persepolis</span>, magnificently depicted in its lion-infested isolation. He was not averse to a touch of bathos in some pictures of children and dogs: modern viewers may find such paintings as <span class="italic">Sympathy</span> (exh. RA, 1878; Royal Holloway College; a preparatory version, Tate collection) overly sentimental but such works touched the hearts and loosened the purse strings of Victorian collectors. Sometimes, in such paintings as <span class="italic">His Only Friend</span> (exh. RA, 1871; Manchester City Galleries), he achieved genuine pathos.<br>
<br>In 1878 Riviere was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, an honour well deserved by such <i>tours de force</i> as <span class="italic">Apollo</span> (exh. RA, 1874; Art Gallery and Museum, Bury) and <span class="italic">In Manus Tuas, Domina</span> (exh. RA, 1879; Manchester City Galleries). These paintings were followed by his diploma painting, <span class="italic">The King Drinks</span> (exh. RA, 1880; Royal Academy of Arts), and full membership in that year. Outstanding biblical and classical works, featuring animals prominently, followed: <span class="italic">The Miracle of the Gadarene Swine</span> (exh. RA, 1883; Tate collection), <span class="italic">Actaeon</span> (exh. RA, 1884), <span class="italic">An Old World Wanderer</span> (exh. RA, 1887), <span class="italic">Prometheus</span> (exh. RA, 1889; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), <span class="italic">Phoebus Apollo</span> (exh. RA, 1895; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), <span class="italic">The Temptation in the Wilderness</span> (Guildhall Art Gallery, London), and <span class="italic">Aphrodite</span> (exh. RA, 1902). His use of strong, simple composition, combined with good draughtsmanship and choice of colour, produced striking works.<br>
<br>Riviere perceived a similitude between the lithe figures of wild animals and those of the young male nude, and in some paintings he combined both, with great success. <span class="italic">Endymion</span> (exh. RA, 1880) and <span class="italic">Dead Hector</span> (exh. RA, 1892; Manchester City Galleries) were exhibited at the academy but he showed <span class="italic">Adonis's Farewell</span> (1888; Bradfield College, Reading) in the more broadminded environment of the Grosvenor Gallery in London; a notably sensuous image in this vein is <span class="italic">Adonis Wounded</span> (exh. RA, 1887; Sutton Place Foundation).<br>
<br>In 1896&#151;after the death of Millais&#151;Riviere narrowly missed being elected president of the Royal Academy, an honour which would not have suited his retiring disposition and, later, his failing eyesight. His subject matter now extended to landscapes of solitary magnificence, such as <span class="italic">Beyond Man's Footsteps</span> (exh. RA, 1894; Tate collection), and portraits, with or without attending domestic animals. Financial considerations forced him to turn to portraiture: the waning popularity of academic canvases left him&#151;the father of five sons and two daughters&#151;with a declining income.<br>
<br>In 1891 Sir William Armstrong published a monograph on Riviere in the <span class="italic">Art Annual</span>, an honour accorded only to pre-eminent academicians. Hubert von Herkomer painted his portrait (1893, Royal Academy of Arts), and Onslow Ford made a bust of him for Oriel College, Oxford, which institution gave him an honorary fellowship in 1910. Over the years he moved his studio a number of times, settling finally at Flaxley, 82 Finchley Road, Hampstead, London, which he had had rebuilt for his use. Respected for his natural distinction, courtesy, and culture, Riviere died on 20 April 1920 at 82 Finchley Road and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 23 April; he was survived by his wife. His eldest son, Hugh Goldwin Riviere (1869&#150;1956), was a well-known portraitist.<br>
