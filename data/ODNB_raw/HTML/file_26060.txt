<span class="headword">Southwell,  Edward</span>  (1671&#150;1730), <span class="occ">politician and government official</span>, was born on 4 September 1671, the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26066/', "Sir Robert Southwell (1635&#150;1702)")</script>, diplomat and government official, of King's Weston, in Gloucestershire, and of Kinsale, co. Cork, and his wife, Elizabeth (1649&#150;1682), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37354/', "Sir Edward Dering")</script> of Surrenden Dering in Kent. His father was a career bureaucrat, resident in Westminster, and Edward was sent to schools in Kensington and Bloomsbury before going up to Merton College, Oxford, in 1687. In the previous year he had been admitted to Lincoln's Inn, his father's inn of court, but did not pursue a legal education. Nor did he stay long at Oxford, his father ordering him home in 1688 in alarm at King James's interventions in the government of the university. In any case Sir Robert envisaged a public rather than an academic career for his clever son. At his prompting Edward attended the prince of Orange during the revolution of 1688, observed the military campaign in Ireland in 1690, and accompanied his maternal cousin Lord Nottingham in 1691 to the allied conference at The Hague. Southwell's intellectual precocity received recognition in his election to the Royal Society in 1692. In that same year he took his first step into public service when he was made joint prothonotary of common pleas in Ireland and was elected to the Irish parliament. Then in 1693 he followed in his father's footsteps as a clerk of the privy council. There followed a succession of other posts, but it was in the council offices that Southwell made his mark, as a diligent and skilful administrator.<br>
<br>His father's death in 1702 seems to have coincided with a sudden flowering of Southwell's career. First he succeeded to the prestigious but largely honorific post that Sir Robert had held, of secretary of state for Ireland. Within a year he had been elected to the Westminster parliament for the cinque port of Rye, on the Ashburnham interest; had concluded a highly advantageous marriage, on 29 October 1703, to Lady Elizabeth Cromwell (<i>b</i>. after 1672, <i>d</i>. 1709), daughter and heir of Vere Essex, fourth earl of Ardglass (1625&#150;1687); and had been appointed chief secretary to the new lord lieutenant of Ireland, the second duke of Ormond. His Irish background and connections (the family fortune had been made in plantation in Munster) and his father's long association with the Ormond family made him a natural choice, and he served in both Ormond's viceroyalties, in 1703&#150;7 and in 1710&#150;13. Although a highly efficient secretary, and in that respect just the type of servant the indolent Ormond needed, he was not particularly effective in the political aspects of the chief secretary's role and tended to leave parliamentary management in Ireland to local politicians. Inevitably he was associated with the tory policies followed by Ormond, and in British politics too he seems to have been identified as a tory, although a very moderate one, and naturally inclined towards administration, so much so that he was unable to find a constituency willing to return him in the tory landslide of 1710. When he recovered his Westminster seat in the general election of 1713 he sat as a &#145;Hanoverian tory&#146;, and he was continued in all his offices under the incoming dynasty in 1714, though he did not sit in either parliament thereafter.<br>
<br>Some time after the death of &#145;Lady Betty&#146; in 1709 Southwell took as his second wife, in 1716, Anne, daughter of another &#145;civil servant&#146;, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2626/', "William Blathwayt (bap. 1650, d. 1717)")</script>; she died in the following year. Cultivated and pious, Southwell was a keen supporter of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and founded charity schools on his Irish estates. His later years were blighted by ill health, following injuries sustained in a road accident, and he eventually died, of a stroke, on 4 December 1730. He was buried at King's Weston. His cousin Lord Perceval, later first earl of Egmont, commented: &#145;No man led a more pleasant life. He was beloved by all his acquaintance for his cheering, obliging temper, and esteemed for his experience in business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.119). His namesake, Edward, his eldest son from his first marriage, who shared various Irish patentee offices with him and eventually succeeded him as secretary of state in Ireland, sat as MP for Bristol from 1739 to 1754.<br>
