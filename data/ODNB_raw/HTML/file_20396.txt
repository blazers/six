<span class="headword">Nugent,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1582), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the fifth son of Sir Christopher Nugent and Marian or Marion, daughter of Nicholas St Lawrence, third Baron Howth. Having entered Lincoln's Inn in 1558, he was involved in 1560 in an altercation with two other students from Ireland, Robert Dillon and John Talbot, for which he was bound over to keep the peace. This animosity between Dillon and Nugent, grounded in personal and familial rivalry, was eventually to lead to Nugent's downfall.<br>
<br>Nugent's service to the crown in Ireland began when he was named as a commissioner for determining the title to certain lands on 19 November 1564. His appointment during pleasure to the office of chief solicitor to the crown on 5 December 1566 was in the place of Lucas Dillon (the cousin of Robert Dillon), recently created attorney-general. With the two Dillons and twenty-three other leading judges and lawyers from the pale, Nugent shared in the renewal of the royal lease of the Blackfriars or King's Inns near Dublin in January 1567. Although the lawyers' aspirations to establish a system of legal training there may have come to nothing, the influence of their profession on the reform programme of the early Elizabethan period was significant. Nugent, for example, served on a number of government commissions in the 1560s and 1570s for establishing the political and legal writ of the Tudor administration in Munster, Connaught, and the north midlands.<br>
<br>The advancement of Nugent's legal career was undoubtedly aided by his marriage to Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1615), daughter of Sir John Plunkett, chief justice of the queen's bench, and widow of Walter Marward, baron of Skreen, co. Meath. The couple had at least one son, <a href="#cosubject_20396">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Nugent also took on the wardship of his stepdaughter, Jenet Marward. On 18 October 1570 he was created second baron of the exchequer, but his service on the bench was jeopardized by his growing involvement in the campaign of the leading landowners of the pale against cess, the government's policy of arbitrary taxation for the victualling of the army in Ireland. He was twice imprisoned in Dublin Castle in 1577 and 1578 for his recalcitrance, and was eventually deprived of his office by the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney. On Sidney's retirement he was appointed to the office of chief justice of common pleas on the recommendation of the lord chancellor, Sir William Gerard. While popular with many of the gentry of the pale, Nugent's appointment was bitterly resented by Robert Dillon, who had regarded the job as his entitlement.<br>
<br>With the support of higher officials in Dublin such as Sir Henry Wallop (who asserted that Gerard had received &pound;100 as a bribe from Nugent), Dillon succeeded in overturning the appointment and securing his own elevation in 1581. Against the background of the Nugent conspiracy led by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45623/', "William Nugent (1550&#150;1625)")</script>, who had married Nicholas's stepdaughter after a dramatic abduction, Nicholas was vulnerable to the charge of complicity, especially as he had been made responsible by the Irish privy council for William's younger son Christopher. In the course of his negotiations over the boy, Nugent had had dealings with one John Cusack of Ellistonrede, co. Meath. Cusack had played a conspicuous part in William Nugent's rebellion but turned state's evidence on the promise of a pardon. On Cusack's information Nicholas Nugent and Edward Cusack, son and heir of Sir Thomas Cusack, were committed to Dublin Castle on 28 January 1582.<br>
<br>They were tried before a special commission at Trim on 4 April. The only witness against Nugent was John Cusack, by whom he was charged with being privy to William Nugent's rebellion and with planning the assassination of Sir Robert and Sir Lucas Dillon. Nugent objected that the evidence of one witness&#151;his personal enemy&#151;was insufficient. His objection being overruled, Nugent denied the truth of Cusack's accusations, and he also denied some admissions he had apparently made earlier to Sir Lucas Dillon and Sir Geoffrey Fenton. The lord deputy, Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton, who &#145;sate upon the benche to see justice more equally ministered&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1574&#150;85</i>, 364), addressed the jury before it retired. When it appeared that the jury was in favour of an acquittal, Sir Robert brought pressure on the members to find Nugent guilty of treason. Judgment followed, and on the eve of Easter (6 April 1582) Nugent was hanged, &#145;to which death he went resolutely and patiently, protesting that sith he was not found trewe, as he said he ought to have been, he had no longinge to live in infamy&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 4793, fol. 132).<br>
<br>Nugent's conviction and execution, widely regarded as a travesty of justice, were engineered by his bitter rival, Sir Robert Dillon, with the connivance of senior figures in the Dublin administration. After his death his widow, Ellen, succeeded in obtaining a reversal of his attainder, despite the opposition of Wallop, and on 27 August 1584 the queen granted his estate to her for life. The heir to Nicholas and Ellen Nugent was <a name="cosubject_20396"></a><span class="headword">Richard Nugent</span>  (<em>b. </em>1564/5, <em>d.</em> in or after 1615)<span class="occ"></span>. At the time of the Nugent conspiracy in 1581 (when he was sixteen), he was taken hostage by the Irish privy council as a surety for the delivery of his cousin, son of the leading insurgent, William Nugent. He was released on recognizances of &pound;1000. He married Anne, daughter of Christopher Bath of Rathfeigh, co. Meath, and had at least one child, Christopher. In keeping with the literary traditions within the Nugent family, Richard was, like his first cousin William, an accomplished poet. He was apparently the author of <span class="italic">Rich. Nugent's Cynthia, containing direfull sonnets, madrigalls and passionate intercourses, describing his repudiate affections expressed in loves owne language</span>. The work was printed by Thomas Purfoot for Henry Tomes in London in 1604. Richard succeeded his mother to the Nugent estate on 9 November 1615 but the extent of his tenure is uncertain, as is the date of his death.<br>
