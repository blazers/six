<span class="headword">Lacy,  Walter  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1241), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15852/', "Hugh de Lacy (d. 1186)")</script> and Rose (<i>d</i>. before 1180), widow of Baderon of Monmouth (<i>d</i>. 1170&times;76), and the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15853/', "Hugh de Lacy (d. 1242)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Recoveryofhisinheritance"></a>Recovery of his inheritance</h2>A minor at the time of his father's death in 1186, Walter de Lacy succeeded to Hugh's estates in England, Wales, and Normandy during the final quarter of the year 1188/9. He had difficulty gaining possession of his father's Irish lordship of Mide, because John, son of Henry II, sought to retain it in his own hands to maximize his wealth as lord of Ireland. It was not until John had rebelled against King Richard and the king had assumed lordship of Ireland in person in 1194 that Lacy gained full possession of Mide. King Richard appointed Lacy and the lord of Ulster, John de Courcy, as his justiciars in Ireland in place of John's agents, Peter Pipard and William Petit. When the latter resisted their removal, Lacy and Courcy waged war against them. Following John's reconciliation with King Richard, Lacy and Courcy were replaced by John's nominee, Hamo de Valognes. About the same time, John issued a charter restoring Mide to Lacy to hold on the same terms as had his father on the day of his death. On 5 July 1194 Lacy established a borough at Drogheda, conferring on it the customs of Breteuil, an early indication of his interest in the economic exploitation of his Irish lordship.<br>
<br>In 1198 Lacy negotiated a proffer of 3100 marks to recover King Richard's goodwill and his Norman and English lands (except Ludlow Castle), an earlier offer of 1000 marks in 1197 having been rejected. An order issued by King John shortly after his accession hints at why this was necessary. The king instructed his justiciar in Ireland on 4 September 1199, in the context of restoring to royal favour Henry Tirel, to inquire whether Henry &#145;had sided with John de Courcy and Walter de Lacy and aided them in destroying the king's land of Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rotuli de oblatis et finibus</span>, 74). It may be that John, as lord of Ireland, had persuaded King Richard to sequestrate Lacy's lands in England and Normandy for actions taken in Ireland; alternatively, Richard may have taken exception to Lacy's subsequently reaching an accommodation with John in respect of his Irish lands, and sought to maintain his overriding lordship there.<h2>
<a name="ServicetoKingJohn"></a>Service to King John</h2>Between September 1199 and March 1201 Walter de Lacy witnessed charters issued by King John, suggesting that he was retained in the royal retinue, while about October 1200 Meiler fitz Henry, justiciar in Ireland, was directed to take hostages from Lacy's principal tenants in Mide. About November 1200 Lacy's marriage was arranged to Margaret or Margery, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3283/', "William (III) de Briouze")</script>, a baron with extensive holdings in the Welsh marches, who had been newly created lord of the honour of Limerick. The alliance was of mutual benefit: Briouze supervised Lacy's estates in the marches, while Lacy in turn guarded his father-in-law's Irish interests.<br>
<br>On 10 February 1204 the king, in a letter requesting an aid from the clergy of Ireland for his campaign in Normandy, stated that he was sending Lacy as a messenger to them. In that year, however, Walter de Lacy lost his Norman lands at Lassy, Campeaux, and Le Pin to King Philip Augustus of France, who had granted the greater part of them to his own nominees by 1205. In the meantime Lacy acted on King John's behalf in negotiations with Cathal &Oacute; Conchobhair, king of Connacht, and between Meiler fitz Henry and William de Burgh. On 31 August 1204 the king addressed a letter jointly to the justiciar and Walter de Lacy ordering the summons to the king of Lacy's former ally John de Courcy. If Courcy failed to respond, eight cantreds of his land nearest Mide were to be granted to Lacy and to his brother Hugh. Walter assisted Hugh in the expulsion of Courcy from Ulster, and when in 1205 Courcy attempted to retake Ulster by force with the help of his brother-in-law Ragnvald, king of Man, it was Walter de Lacy who repulsed them. On 30 June 1205 the king ordered Meiler fitz Henry as justiciar to take heed of the advice of Hugh de Lacy, newly created earl of Ulster, who was to be his coadjutor, and of Walter.<h2>
<a name="ConflictwithKingJohn"></a>Conflict with King John</h2>Walter de Lacy's ties with his father-in-law, William de Briouze, probably served only to extend to Lacy the mistrust that John already felt towards Briouze; in any case the king was suspicious of the power of magnates like Lacy, Briouze, and William (I) Marshal, who held substantial lands both in the Welsh marches and in Ireland. On 2 November 1204 the king had instructed Lacy to hand over to Meiler fitz Henry Limerick, custody of which Lacy was exercising on behalf of Briouze. By 23 August 1205 the king had changed tack and restored the custody of Limerick to Briouze, on whose behalf Lacy was still acting, provided that Briouze gave sureties for arrears that he owed for the farm and tallage of the city. A drastic deterioration in Lacy's relations with the king was signalled on 21 February 1207, when John addressed a letter to the barons of Mide and Leinster thanking them for their loyalty in the dispute between Meiler fitz Henry and Walter de Lacy over the city of Limerick. On 14 April 1207 Lacy was summoned to England to answer charges, pending the hearing of which his lands in Ireland were not to be confiscated. On 26 May 1207 the king had to rebuke his barons in Leinster and Mide for demands that they had made of his justiciar, seeking restoration of U&iacute; Failge in north Leinster to the lord of Leinster, William Marshal, without the consent of the king. Meiler had earlier taken U&iacute; Failge into the king's hand by royal order. There was then a concerted move by William Marshal and Walter de Lacy against Meiler, who was a tenant of both magnates. A substantial force from Leinster harried the lands that Meiler held of Lacy in Mide and besieged the castle of Ardnurcher for five weeks; shortly thereafter Meiler was taken prisoner and obliged to give hostages for his good conduct to William Marshal's wife, Isabel, at Kilkenny Castle. Thus forced to compromise, by 5 December the king had reached an accommodation with Lacy, granting him custody of the cantred of Ardmayle, Tipperary. On 19 March 1208 Meiler was instructed that Lacy enjoyed the king's peace and that Meiler was not to wage war on him, his men, or his lands in Ireland. On 24 April 1208 Lacy received a revised charter confirming Mide for fifty knights' fees, but under more restricted terms.<br>
<br>The period of harmony between John and the Anglo-Norman magnates did not last. By 1210, when John mounted an expedition in person to Ireland, Walter de Lacy's relations with the king had again worsened. He became embroiled in the conflict between John and his father-in-law, William de Briouze, after Briouze had fallen from grace, rebelled, and fled across the Irish Sea. After the king's landing in Ireland, Lacy's seneschal, William Petit, proffered submission on his behalf to John on 28 June 1210, seeking to dissociate Lacy from the plunder committed by his brother Hugh in Ulster and Mide, and pleading that both Walter and his tenants had suffered much at the hands of Hugh. Nevertheless, Walter de Lacy's English and Irish estates were confiscated by the king. The profits accruing to the crown from the lordship of Mide are indicated in detail on the surviving Irish pipe roll from John's reign for 1211/12 and amounted to a substantial annual income in excess of &pound;770, not including renders in kind.<h2>
<a name="Reconciliationandrecoveryoflands"></a>Reconciliation and recovery of lands</h2>The baronial revolt in England afforded an opportunity for Walter de Lacy's reconciliation with King John. The alliance formed between the baronial opposition and the Welsh ruler Llywelyn ab Iorwerth threatened the security of the Welsh marches and made Lacy a natural ally of the king. On 1 July 1213 John granted Walter permission to travel to England, probably from Normandy. On 29 July 1213 his English lands were restored, except Ludlow Castle, which was not recovered until 1215. Lacy took part in John's expedition to Poitou in 1214. On 5 July 1215 he recovered his Irish lands, apart from the castle of Drogheda, having proffered 40,000 marks. His son was to remain as a hostage until full payment was completed. On 18 August 1216 Lacy was appointed castellan and sheriff of Hereford (an office that he exercised until Henry III's partial coming of age in November 1223). On 30 August 1216 he was appointed <i>custos</i> of the vacant see of Hereford. He was a witness to King John's will at Newark in October 1216.<br>
<br>Lacy played an important part in ensuring the loyalty of the Welsh marches during the civil war, and he subsequently served on the early council of regency at the beginning of Henry III's minority. These activities allowed him little time to visit his estates in Mide, and he appears to have looked to his half-brother, William Gorm (<i>d</i>. 1233), whose mother was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20521/', "Ruaidr&#237; Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht")</script>, to represent his interests there. William had been taken captive by King John during his Irish expedition, but Lacy negotiated his release by 10 February 1215. The annals of Clonmacnoise recount that William's arrival in Ireland in 1215 aroused &#145;great contention and wars between the English of the south of Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Clonmacnoise</span>, 228), obliging Lacy to give the king security for the past excesses and future behaviour of his half-brother.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoIreland"></a>Return to Ireland</h2>In 1220 Walter de Lacy was back in Ireland after a ten-year absence. He led a great hosting against &Oacute; Raghallaig of east Br&eacute;ifne and captured his crannog (island fortification) on Lough Oughter. In 1221 Lacy granted Br&eacute;ifne from Lough Oughter to Lough Erne to his vassal, Philip de Angulo; however, a letter written in 1224 by Cathal &Oacute; Conchobhair, king of Connacht, to Henry III complained that Br&eacute;ifne had been seized by William Gorm. About 1223 Lacy's brother Hugh, having failed to negotiate the recovery of the earldom of Ulster that King John had taken from him, arrived in Ireland and proceeded to wage war against the Anglo-Norman colonists in alliance with Aodh &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, king of T&iacute;r Eoghain. By 10 June 1224, when Walter de Lacy and the justiciar William (II) Marshal were sent to restore order, war had engulfed Mide and Ulster. In consideration of the excesses committed by the men of Mide in harbouring Hugh de Lacy and pillaging the king's land, Walter had been obliged about March 1224 to agree to the delivery of his castles of Ludlow and Trim into the king's hand for two years. On 13 May 1225 Walter de Lacy was charged 3000 marks for recovery of his Irish lands which had been taken by the king &#145;because of the war waged against the king by Hugh de Lacy in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rotuli litterarum clausarum</span>, 2.39b).<h2>
<a name="Religiouspatronagebankruptcyanddeath"></a>Religious patronage, bankruptcy, and death</h2>Walter de Lacy's fines to the king in 1198, 1213, and 1225, together with his castle building activities in Mide and on the Welsh marches, as well as his ecclesiastical benefactions, involved him in considerable financial liabilities. None the less he was able to make donations in Ireland to Llanthony Prima, Gwent, which had a cell at Duleek in Meath, and Llanthony Secunda, Gloucestershire, which had a cell at Colp, also in Meath, to Fore Priory, Westmeath, and to St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin; he founded a house of Benedictine nuns at Ballymore Loughswedy in Westmeath and a small Cistercian house at Beybeg, Meath, as a daughter house of Beaubec in Normandy, and a Grandmontine house at Craswell, Herefordshire. For more than two decades before his death in 1241 he was heavily reliant on money loans from Jewish financiers to service his debts. A plea roll of the exchequer of the Jews of 1244, which records details of debts owing in that year to the family of Hamo of Hereford, reveals that at the time of his death Walter de Lacy was in debt to Hamo to the sum of &pound;1266 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. During the minority of Henry III Lacy had been able to postpone payment of the annual sums due from his fines; the fact that he was sheriff of Hereford from 1216 to 1223 had also facilitated mutually advantageous relations with Hamo. However, after Hamo's death in 1232, when his family had to meet a relief of 6000 marks imposed by the crown, it became necessary for them to pursue creditors more urgently. Following representations by a number of Jews for recovery of debts owed by Lacy, the crown on 19 November 1240 issued orders for the distraint of his estates.<br>
<br>At the time of his death in early 1241, apparently before 28 February, Walter de Lacy was blind and feeble, bankrupt, and without male heirs. His only son, Gilbert, who married Isabella, daughter of Ralph Bigod, died in 1234, leaving a son, Walter, and two daughters, Matilda and Margaret. This Walter was alive in 1238, and married a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4207/', "Theobald Butler (d. 1205)")</script>, but predeceased his grandfather without heirs. Henry III took this opportunity to dispense patronage by arranging the marriages of the Lacy sisters, now coheirs of the Lacy estates, to noted royal servants. Margaret married John de Verdon, and Matilda married Pierre de Genevre and afterwards <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37448/', "Geoffrey de Geneville")</script>.<br>
