<span class="headword">Ashwell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1478, <em>d.</em> in or after 1524), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was admitted a chorister of St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 29 October 1491, and left on 14 January 1493; so brief a career indicates that he had been recruited by impressment, fully trained, from some other choir. Thereafter he made his career as a church musician. During 1502&#150;3 he was a lay singing-man of the choir of the collegiate church of Tattershall (Lincolnshire), and from summer 1506 until August 1511 he served as master of the choristers and organist of Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>On 24 December 1513 Ashwell progressed to appointment as cantor and master of the lady chapel choir of Durham Cathedral. Here his duties were to train eight boys (of the almonry school) and such monks of the priory as were assigned to him both to play the organ and to execute all the techniques of singing then current: composed polyphony sung from mensural notation, plainsong, and the several skills of vocal improvisation upon plainsong (descant, counter, faburden, and &#145;squarenote&#146;). He was to be in personal attendance in the monks' choir at every high mass, vespers, and evening Marian antiphon that was distinguished with polyphonic music (composed or extempore), singing and also playing the organ when required. Further, he was to be present daily at Lady mass to sing its plainsong and polyphony, doubtless with his monks and boys. Each year he was to compose, in honour of God, St Mary, or St Cuthbert (Durham's patron saint), at least one new mass for four or five voices, or other equivalent music.<br>
<br>Of Ashwell's compositions only two masses have survived intact; two further masses, one Marian antiphon, and one secular song survive in states too fragmentary to permit reconstruction. The complete masses <span class="italic">Ave Maria</span> and <span class="italic">Jesu Christe</span> are both for six voices, huge in scale and replete with rhythmic vitality and intricacy. Their qualities of melodic coherence and harmonic cogency suggest that Ashwell was perhaps the most accomplished of the contemporaries of Robert Fayrfax. His capacity to influence other composers is manifest in the manner in which the five-note motif that he employed as cantus firmus for the now fragmentary mass &#145;God Save King Harry&#146; is to be found also in certain other contemporary works, of which his appears to have been the prototype. A mass so named was copied for the choir of New College, Oxford, in 1518&#150;19; possibly it was written in 1511 for the birth of the first-born (and short-lived) child of Henry VIII, an occasion marked at Lincoln Cathedral with extravagant ringing of the bells. Ashwell's now fragmentary mass <span class="italic">Sancte Cuthberte</span> was clearly written at Durham in fulfilment of his contractual obligations. Long after his death he was listed by Thomas Morley (1597) as one of the composers whose works he had consulted and considered authoritative. Ashwell vacated his office at Durham between May 1524 and May 1525; no will is known, and no further reference has been found.<br>
