<span class="headword">Reid,  Thomas</span>  (1746&#150;1831), <span class="occ">horologist</span>, was born in Dysart, Fife, in January 1746. He was apprenticed in 1762 to a cousin, James Cowan, an able watchmaker in Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. After discharge from his indentures, Reid spent eleven years in London, where, in his own words, &#145;after having received the instruction of the first masters in that profession [he] did carry on business and was employed in the execution of the first-rate work there&#146;  (Smith, 311). When Cowan died in 1781 Reid returned to Edinburgh and succeeded to the business. He married Alexandria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ogilvie, the widow of William Auld, printer, who had died in 1777.<br>
<br>Reid's rise to fame was rapid. Before very long he moved to 8 Parliament Close in Edinburgh. In 1788 a tower clock of his making was put up in St Andrew's parish church. In 1797 he rebuilt that of St Giles's Kirk. His business, however, embraced all aspects of horology. His insistence upon excellence was reflected in his clientele. His enthusiasm, practical ability, and contacts in London and Lancashire ensured success. He corresponded with B. L. Vulliamy (1780&#150;1854) between 1805 and 1826. Reid's best apprentice was his stepson, William Auld (<i>d</i>. 1846), who became his partner in 1806 and who remained his lifelong friend. They moved shop to 33 Princes Street in 1809, and later to no. 66. Reid managed to indulge an all-consuming, if unprofitable, interest in improving regulator clocks, experimenting endlessly with different escapements and compensation pendulums. He was particularly proud of his delicate, &#145;detatched&#146; spring-pallet escapement. This he at first placed outside his movements, where it was vulnerable to damage; however this proved to be an excellent arrangement in a regulator dated 1811 made for Lord Gray's observatory at Kinfauns, Perthshire, and in another dated 1813 for the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. Both survived, but without Reid's escapements. His later regulators, dated 1816 and 1818, have their spring-pallets within their movements and remain unaltered.<br>
<br>Reid and Auld both retired in 1823. The former had assembled a remarkable horological library and always studied unremittingly. As early as 1793 he was invited by the scientist John Robison (1739&#150;1804) to co-operate in the writing of &#145;a magnificent work on the History, Theory and Practice of Horology&#146;. Reid was too busy to comply, but he later addressed long technical letters to the scientific journals and contributed fifteen important horological chapters to Brewster's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</span>. His letter to Vulliamy dated 20 November 1819 reveals, however, that much had been kept back. In 1825 he was elected an honorary member of the Clockmakers' Company. In March 1826 Reid's monumental work <span class="italic">A Treatise on Clock and Watch Making, Theoretical and Practical</span> appeared. It was dedicated to Auld and was to run to seven editions over more than thirty years; it remained authoritative for much longer. A pirated version appeared in Philadelphia in 1832, the year after the author's death. Reid died in Edinburgh on 20 September 1831 and his former partner caused him to be buried in the Auld family tomb in the Calton cemetery, Edinburgh. He is regarded as Scotland's most celebrated maker of clocks, watches, and chronometers.<br>
