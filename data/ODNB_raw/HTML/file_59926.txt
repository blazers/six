<span class="headword">Guest <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grosvenor]</span>, Lady  Theodora</span>  (1840&#150;1924), <span class="occ">author and benefactor</span>, was born at 15 Grosvenor Square, London, on 7 July 1840, the youngest of the thirteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11670/', "Richard Grosvenor, second marquess of Westminster (1795&#150;1869)")</script>, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lady Elizabeth Mary Leveson-Gower (1797&#150;1891), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16539/', "George Granville Leveson-Gower, first duke of Sutherland")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42000/', "Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, nineteenth countess of Sutherland")</script> in her own right. Lady Theodora spent most of her early life at Motcombe House, near Shaftesbury, in Dorset, where she was educated privately by governesses and tutors. Her parents, especially her father, gave her a strict moral upbringing, endeavouring&#151;with great success&#151;to instil the principle of &#145;noblesse oblige&#146;. Between 1865 and 1868 she contributed several articles and poems to <span class="italic">Once a Week</span> and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Her fondness for her Dorset home and the surrounding countryside led her to write her first book, <span class="italic">Motcombe Past and Present</span> (1867). Two further editions followed in 1868 and 1873. A devout, low-church Anglican, she demonstrated her biblical knowledge and evangelical zeal in her second book, <span class="italic">Simple Thoughts on Bible Truths</span> (1873).<br>
<br>When Lady Theodora's father died in 1869 Lady Westminster inherited his Dorset and Wiltshire estates for her lifetime. Lady Theodora then became a constant companion and support to her mother, undertaking many duties on her behalf and assisting in the management of the estates. She gave much personal attention to the village schools and to the night school at Motcombe where she taught. She rode regularly to hounds and was an enthusiastic supporter of hunting throughout her life. It was owing to her that the Hunt Servants Benefit Society was founded in 1872.<br>
<br>In 1874 Lady Westminster purchased Barcote, an estate near Faringdon, Berkshire, and built a large house there for her daughter. But before its completion Lady Theodora became engaged to Thomas Merthyr Guest (1838&#150;1904), second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11716/', "Sir Josiah John Guest")</script> and his wife, subsequently <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24832/', "Lady Charlotte Schreiber")</script>. They were married in Motcombe church on 8 March 1877. Their only child, Elizabeth Augusta, was born in 1879. In that year Inwood House at Henstridge, Somerset, became their home. The Guests travelled extensively and a tour of North America prompted Lady Theodora to write <span class="italic">A Round Trip in North America</span> (1895), illustrated by her own sketches.<br>
<br>Lady Theodora was well known in the south-west for her charitable works and her generous support for many good causes. Her biggest single philanthropic act was building and equipping a cottage hospital, in memory of her husband, at Templecombe, near her home, which she ran for several years at her own expense. She was a staunch Conservative, actively campaigning on behalf of the party, particularly at election times, when she spoke from the platform. In 1908 she declined an invitation to join the suffragette organization the Women's Social and Political Union, and published her reasons for doing so. She then aligned herself with the Anti-Suffrage League.<br>
<br>Like her mother-in-law, Lady Theodora was a collector and connoisseur of porcelain and Battersea enamels. A keen gardener, her gardens and conservatories at Inwood contained many varieties of tropical plants and fruit, for which they were well known.<br>
<br>Even after the rural aristocracy had lost much of their power and influence in the twentieth century, Lady Theodora remained a representative of the old order. She was a great personality, &#145;a <i>grande Dame</i> of the old school&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 March 1924), and a link with Victorian society. She died at Inwood on 24 March 1924 and was buried in Henstridge churchyard on 28 March.<br>
