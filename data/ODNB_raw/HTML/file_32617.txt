<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craven,  Hawes</span>  (1837&#150;1910), <span class="occ">scene painter</span>, was born Henry Hawes Craven Green on 3 July 1837 at Kirkgate, Leeds. His parents, James Green (<i>d</i>. 1881), a comedian, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11380/', "Eliza Craven Green (1803&#150;1866)")</script>, an actress and, later, a poet, were performers on the York circuit. Young Henry acted with his father, and shortened his name to Hawes Craven. In his youth he was also a keen observer and recordist of nature. Fascinated by scene painting, Craven attended the Government School of Design in London from 1851 to 1853 where he won many prizes. Apprenticed in 1853 to John Gray, scene-painter of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, London, he later moved with his master to the Olympic. In 1857 Craven had his first success. Gray had rheumatic fever, so Craven was asked to provide the Eddystone lighthouse set for Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">The Lighthouse</span> (not Collins's <span class="italic">The Frozen Deep</span>, as most obituaries state). He worked from a painting by the noted seascape artist Clarkson Stanfield, so accurately that, in reward, Stanfield gave him his original and the Olympic raised his salary. Later (1867&#150;75) Craven exhibited seven seapieces at the Suffolk Street Galleries, London.<br>
<br>In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Craven assisted William Roxby Beverley, the great transformation-scene exponent, on Drury Lane pantomimes and Covent Garden opera seasons. Richard's great grandfather was the collector and consul in Smyrna, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109573/', "Samuel Crawley")</script>. From 1862 to 1864 he was principal scene-painter for Dublin's Theatre Royal, where, according to Percy Fitzgerald, an eyewitness, his work possessed all &#145;the breadth and effect of rich water-colour drawings somewhat of the Prout school&#146;. In the summer vacation of 1863 and again in 1864 he worked for Charles Fechter at the Lyceum on some elaborate set scenes, after the new mode of mounting plays which Fechter inaugurated.<br>
<br>From Dublin, Craven passed successively in London to the Olympic (under Horace Wigan), where he distinguished himself by his scenery for <span class="italic">The Frozen Deep</span> (October 1864), and to the Adelphi (under Benjamin Webster). He soon increased his reputation by his work for <span class="italic">Play</span> and <span class="italic">School</span>, both produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre (15 February 1868, and January 1869), and by <span class="italic">The Enchanted Isle</span> in the Covent Garden pantomime <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (December 1868). On 3 June 1866 Craven married a principal dancer, Mary Elizabeth Watson Tees (1838&#150;1891), daughter of Alexander Tees, a civil servant; they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>From 1871 to 1901 Craven was principal scene-painter to the Lyceum, first under &#145;Colonel&#146; H. L. Bateman, then his widow (1875&#150;8), and finally under Henry Irving (1878 to 1899, when Irving sold the Lyceum rights). In Craven's early years the theatre employed him; latterly he was freelance and rented the Lyceum's paintshop. Irving was key to this theatre's success, with Craven creating many of his plays' settings. In the first season Leopold Lewis's <span class="italic">The Bells</span> (1871), with its vision scene, was a triumph for both, and the work went to Sandringham for Queen Victoria (29 April 1889), with Craven painting &#145;scenery of suitable size&#146;  (Stoker, 375) for its drawing-room. In 1874 and 1878 Craven set Irving's two productions of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (1879), created with the scene-painters William Telbin and Walter Hann, was an &#145;artistic display which will never be seen again&#146;  (Darbyshire, 101&#150;2). The &#145;unparalled beauty&#146; of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1882) &#145;not even the sternest critic disputed&#146;  (Irving, 386), though Clement Scott did find settings and lighting &#145;all beautiful enough, but they are a trying background for the central figures&#146;  (Booth, 55).<br>
<br>Irving believed in restraint, harmony, and archaeological accuracy, so would invite other artists to oversee plays' designs: Craven solved the problems of realization. The journal editor and architect Sir James Knowles supervised Tennyson's <span class="italic">The Cup</span> (1881); the book illustrator and landscape painter Keeley Halswelle, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1888); the genre painter John Seymour Lucas, <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (1892); Ford Madox Brown, <span class="italic">King Lear</span> (1892); Sir Edward Burne-Jones, <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (1895), by Wills and Comyns Carr; and Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> (1901). For <span class="italic">The Cup</span>'s temple of Artemis, Craven created &#145;a speciousness of proportion&#146;  (Terry, 154), while <span class="italic">King Arthur</span>'s pastoral scenes were of such &#145;transcendent beauty&#146;  (Stoker, 165) that Ellen Terry recalled Craven painting &#145;the flicker of golden sunlight &hellip; better than anyone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 27 July 1910). Craven varied his style in keeping with the lighting at the various theatres in which he worked. For example, the Lyceum used subtly controlled gas and there Craven's sunset, fading over Martha's three-dimensional garden in Nuremberg, provided in 1886 &#145;one of the most beautiful&#146; scenes in Wills's <span class="italic">Faust</span>  (Booth, 110). By contrast, he adapted his technique for the electric-lit Savoy and Royal English Opera, where he worked on six Gilbert and Sullivan operettas (1884&#150;93) and Sullivan's opera <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1891) respectively. At Her Majesty's, also lit electrically, Craven produced sets for Herbert Beerbohm Tree's sumptuous Shakespearian productions, and, for Stephen Phillips's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> (1902), Craven &#145;used black velvet &hellip; to paint on with striking effect&#146;  (<span class="italic">South Eastern Herald</span>, 27 July 1910) in his creation of Hades.<br>
<br>Craven worked for over fifty years, and was remarkable for his Yorkshire grit, his care, his unflappability, and his good nature. Some design sketches are preserved in the Victoria and Albert and the Theatre museums, and an act drop at Craig-y-nos Castle, Brecknockshire. However, on 18 February 1898 the sets of over forty productions were burnt in Irving's Southwark scene-store fire. In 1905 Craven was appointed president of the Scenic Artists' Association. He died of acute bronchitis at his home, Fairlight, 246 Brockley Road, Brockley, London, on 22 July 1910 and was buried in Brockley protestant cemetery. Newspapers widely reported his death. The <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> suggested Craven was &#145;the greatest scene-painter&#146;  (27 July 1910); certainly he was the equal of William Telbin and the younger Joseph Harker. His &#145;scenes were real pictures, with the atmosphere and charm of fine paintings&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Standard</span>, 27 July 1910).<br>
