<span class="headword">Boyd,  Zachary</span>  (1585&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university administrator</span>, was born in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, of unknown parentage. He matriculated at Glasgow University in 1601, and graduated MA from St Andrews in 1607. Perhaps encouraged by his cousin Robert Boyd of Trochrig he completed his education at the protestant University of Saumur, where he was eventually appointed regent professor in 1611. Boyd declined the principalship in 1615 and he returned to Scotland in 1623. After living for a short time in the households of Sir William Scott in Elie (probably Sir William Scott of Clerkington, <i>d</i>. 1656) and the marquess of Hamilton, Boyd was called to the Barony parish in the suburbs of Glasgow, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Boyd enjoyed a long-time relationship with Glasgow University. He was elected dean in 1631, and was re-elected in 1633 and 1635. In 1634, and again in 1635 and 1645, he was elected rector, and in 1644 he was appointed vice-chancellor. Boyd married Elizabeth Fleming of Glasgow, who died in 1636, and Margaret Mure, who outlived him. Both marriages were childless. Remembered for his generosity towards Glasgow University, Boyd bequeathed it assets of approximately 20,000 marks. The source of his income remains a mystery.<br>
<br>Boyd was a supporter of the national covenant of 1638, and, like other Scots presbyters, he viewed Cromwell and his Independents as a threat to Scottish presbyterian government. An apocryphal story is told of how Boyd remained at his post, even while the magistrates and ministers of Glasgow fled in the face of Cromwell's army. Pagan indicates that when Cromwell and his officers appeared at the cathedral church, Boyd &#145;railed on them all to their very face in the High Church&#146;  (Pagan, 43&#150;4). Cromwell's response was to invite Boyd for dinner, and the two were said to have spent the night together talking and praying.<br>
<br>Much of Boyd's published work is religious poetry of dubious merit. Samuel Colvil's observation is fairly typical when he wrote, &#145;bad lines many times causeth more mirth than good ones. Where one laughs the poems of Virgil, Homer, Ariosto, Du Bartas &hellip; twenty will laugh at those of &hellip; Mr. Zacharie Boyd&#146;  (Colvil, sig. A7<i>r</i>). Others were kinder, as when John Sleazer argued that Boyd's reputation as a bad poet was &#145;grossly exaggerated&#146;. Boyd's published poetry appears in three separate collections: <span class="italic">The Garden of Zion</span> (1644), <span class="italic">The Psalms of David in Meeter</span> (1644), and <span class="italic">Scriptural Songs or Holy Poems</span> (1645), all of which are retellings of biblical stories. Two other collections of verse, the <span class="italic">Four Evangels</span> and <span class="italic">Zion's Flowers, or, Christian Poems for Spiritual Edification</span>, were never published, except for four of the poems of <span class="italic">Zion's Flowers</span>, brought out in 1855 by the Edinburgh bibliophile Gabriel Neil. Boyd's reputation as a bad poet was not helped when his metrical paraphrase of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> was passed over by the commissioners of the general assembly, although he eventually did play a role in the development of the psalter, and merited a special thanks of the general assembly minuted on 1 January 1650.<br>
<br>Boyd's reputation as a poet has unquestionably influenced opinion about his prose, which is certainly worthy of attention as a revealing barometer of seventeenth-century Scottish religiosity. While his most important published prose work, <span class="italic">The Last Battell of the Soule in Death</span>, is long and prolix, it possesses a dramatic realism making it an important contribution to the tradition of the <i>ars moriendi</i>. Boyd's strength, though, was as a preacher, and his sermons exhibit a robustness that leaves Boyd well placed in relation to others who wrote in the plain style. A staunch Calvinist, Boyd took very seriously the special role of the preacher in the calling of God's elect to his true church. Only a handful of Boyd's sermons were published during his lifetime, <span class="italic">A Sermon of Preparation to the Communion</span> and <span class="italic">A Sermon for the Day of the Sacrament</span> (1629) and <span class="italic">Two Orientall Pearles, Grace and Glory</span> (1629). Boyd did leave behind, however, 254 unpublished sermons and devotional works currently housed in Glasgow University Library, which Boyd himself organized into a number of collections in anticipation of publication. His unpublished works cover a range of issues, including the need for church reform, the nature of the purified church, the role of preaching in the reform church, and the importance of rigorous spiritual self-examination.<br>
<br>Boyd died in Glasgow in 1653 and was buried there.<br>
