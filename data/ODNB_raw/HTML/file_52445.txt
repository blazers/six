</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Griffith, Sir  Samuel Walker</span>  (1845&#150;1920), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 21 June 1845 at Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, the second son of the Revd Edward Griffith (1819&#150;1891), Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary Walker (<i>d</i>. 1892). Griffith's father then held ministries at Portishead and Wiveliscombe, Somerset, after which he and his family sailed for Australia in 1853 at the invitation of the Colonial Missionary Society, where he became Congregational minister in Ipswich, Queensland. He subsequently transferred to Maitland, New South Wales, and later to Wharf Street, Brisbane.<br>
<br>Griffith first attended school in Ipswich, then at Woolloomooloo in Sydney, and finally at Maitland, where he was top student. He went on to the University of Sydney where he graduated with first-class honours, winning scholarships in mathematics and classics, and graduating BA (1863) and MA (1870). On 5 July 1870 he married, at Maitland, Julia Janet (<i>d</i>. 1925), youngest daughter of James Thomson, commissioner of crown lands in East Maitland. By then Griffith had embarked on a legal career by entering into articles of clerkship with Arthur Macalister at Ipswich in 1863. In 1865, however, he was granted permission to interrupt his articles, on being awarded the prestigious Mort travelling fellowship of the University of Sydney. Under its terms, he travelled to the United Kingdom, and then to continental Europe, after which he returned to England to spend some months, before returning to Brisbane. Overseas he studied works of art, sculpture, architecture, and literature. On his return to Queensland, he completed his articles in September 1867, passed the bar examinations, and was admitted to the bar in the following month. He had early success; his practice grew, diversified, and prospered, and led him to undisputed leadership of the bar. He was appointed QC in 1876. Despite his increasing involvement in politics, Griffith maintained his flourishing private practice at the bar right up to the point at which he became chief justice in 1893.<br>
<br>From early years, Griffith developed an interest in politics, first evidenced by attendance at parliamentary debates, and in 1862 he published a series of twenty-five articles on members of the Queensland parliament. He entered parliament in 1872 as member for East Moreton, transferring to Oxley at the election of 1873. He rapidly established himself in the parliamentary arena, and in 1874 he was appointed attorney-general. To these responsibilities he added the portfolios of public instruction and public works. In 1879 he succeeded to the leadership of the Liberal Party, to which he came in opposition, the government having fallen in 1878. He proved himself to be an effective parliamentary leader in opposition to the ministry of his chief political rival Sir Thomas McIlwraith. He became premier in November 1883 and was in office until June 1888, displaying a capacity for extremely hard work. He maintained a close supervision over the work of his ministers and was a reluctant delegator.<br>
<br>During his first premiership, Griffith opposed the growing movement to divide Queensland; this reflected his fears that new colonies would be dominated by sugar planters, though he later recognized the need for administrative arrangements to take account of distance and diversity. On the controversial issue of the continuing use of kanaka (Pacific islands') labour, in 1884 he tightened the regulations governing their work conditions, and his government introduced and carried the act forbidding their employment altogether after a further ten years. At this time, Griffith had a reputation as something of a radical. He supported legislation for employers' liability and for the recognition of trade unions; in his writings he advocated a significant role for government in the protection of the weak. The socialist leader, William Lane, wrote to him approvingly in December 1888 that &#145;what Pericles was to Athens and Greece, such a leader [Griffith] could be to Australia and Queensland&#146;  (Joyce, 380 n. 63). Approbation, however, was not universal and his opponents in Queensland gave him the name Oily Sam.<br>
<br>The government fell in 1888, but was returned to office in August 1890, when Griffith again became premier in unlikely alliance with his long-time rival, McIlwraith. Economic conditions were deteriorating, and this led to bitter strikes, notably in the pastoral industry. Griffith responded by insisting on compliance with the law, and he took strong action: the military was called out, and strikers were arrested and imprisoned. While Griffith was vilified by those who had formerly praised him, he acted with caution and was a restraining force. Faced with worsening economic conditions, he also proposed helping planters by extending for ten years the importation of kanaka labour, and parliament approved the measure.<br>
<br>Over a long period, Griffith showed a continuing interest in Australian security and defence, and in moves to closer intercolonial association. At a conference in 1883, he supported the annexation of New Guinea and the establishment of a federal council for Australasia; he drafted the act for its establishment, was a regular attender at its meetings, and became its president. It was a defective organization with very limited powers and never had the support of New South Wales. A new initiative for Australian federation by Sir Henry Parkes of New South Wales in 1889 led to a meeting in Melbourne in 1890, which was followed by the first national Australasian constitutional convention, which met in Sydney in March 1891. Griffith, then premier of Queensland, played a leading role in it, particularly in the drafting of the constitution adopted by this body. Alfred Deakin, of Victoria, who was later thrice prime minister of Australia, paid high tribute to Griffith's achievement in his <span class="italic">Federal Story</span> (Deakin, 50): &#145;In every clause the measure bore the stamp of Sir Samuel Griffith's patient and untiring handiwork, his terse, clear style and force of expression. At [the] close Griffith's influence had become supreme &hellip; no other representative rivalled him.&#146;<br>
<br>In 1893 Griffith accepted appointment as chief justice of Queensland, succeeding to the office at a time when its standing was low. He restored its reputation, and added significantly to his own as a distinguished lawyer and judge. He made a distinctive contribution through the preparation of a criminal code, on which he worked for years, aiming to make the criminal law as simple and generally accessible as possible. His code was approved by a royal commission, passed through the Queensland parliament, and was given assent by him as acting governor in November 1899. It came into force on 1 January 1901, the same day as the Australian commonwealth constitution. The code was largely copied in Western Australia, and became a model for criminal codes elsewhere in the world.<br>
<br>As chief justice of Queensland, Griffith could play no active role in the constitutional convention of 1897&#150;8 which devised and adopted the constitution which, with a few amendments, became the constitution of the commonwealth of Australia. His draft of 1891 was, however, available to the convention and many of his detailed and at times critical comments upon the later drafts were incorporated in amendments to it. It has been fairly said that the final form of the Australian constitution contains not only much of Griffith's text of 1891, but also his &#145;lofty corrections of the words of the later and lesser draftsmen of 1897&#146;  (La Nauze, 191).<br>
<br>Griffith went further, and in the final stages of negotiation with the United Kingdom government on the passage of the bill, which had been endorsed by popular referendum in the Australian colonies, he intervened in support of the retention of appeals to the privy council. For a time this threatened the passage of the bill, but at the end a compromise was reached on a form of words which Griffith proposed. His reasons for acting in this way are not clear; his action certainly earned him the enmity of some Australian supporters of federation, and this was reflected in opposition&#151;albeit unsuccessful&#151;to his appointment as chief justice of the high court of Australia.<br>
<br>It is said that when Griffith accepted appointment to the Queensland bench in 1893, he had in view a greater place in a future federated Australia, and in the early days of ministry making in the infant commonwealth his name was mentioned. The high court of Australia was not established until 1903, and Griffith had a major role in the drafting of the <span class="roman">Judiciary Act</span>, under which it was finally constituted. It was envisaged that it should be a court of five judges (including the chief justice) with pension entitlements; in the event, after negotiation, it was established as a court of three, and it was only in the last days of his membership of the court that a pension was granted to the retiring chief justice, who was Griffith himself. Griffith's appointment as chief justice was greeted favourably by many but opposed by those who disapproved of his apparent changes of course in his second premiership, and of his role in the privy council appeal issue.<br>
<br>The High Court was constituted as a general court of appeal from state courts, as well as a distinctive federal court with a critically important role in the interpretation of the constitution. All three judges, Griffiths, Edmund Barton, and Richard O'Connor, had been founding fathers, and they soon established a close relationship, both personal and in their reading of the constitution. In the early days, there was a short but unhappy clash with Sir Josiah Symon, attorney-general in the Reid&#150;McLean government, but that was resolved with the fall of that government. An amendment to the <span class="roman">Judiciary Act</span> provided for the appointment of two additional judges, and in 1906 Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins, both members of the 1897&#150;8 convention and attorneys-general in earlier federal ministries, took their seats.<br>
<br>From this time, divisions opened up within the court. Griffith and Isaacs in particular were not comfortable colleagues. Both were dominant, driving, and ambitious men who differed in style and in their legal and constitutional philosophies. Sir Owen Dixon, the great Australian jurist, while acknowledging Griffith's intellectual and professional qualities, speaks of him as having a legal mind of the Austinian age, representing the thoughts and learning of a period which had gone. There was division over major principles of constitutional interpretation; Griffith's reading of the constitution, which he was generally able to impose, emphasized the role of the states, while Isaacs's developed doctrine was strongly centralist. In the <i>Engineers' case</i>, a great constitutional case decided in 1920, soon after Griffith's death, Isaacs's doctrine prevailed. From time to time Griffith advised governors-general on constitutional matters; he was held in very high esteem by R. C. Munro Ferguson, governor-general from 1914 to 1920. Griffith retired from the court in 1919. He had been unwell for a long time, and was deeply preoccupied with his physical infirmities. To the dismay of his old and ailing friend Barton, he supported the appointment of Sir Adrian Knox rather than Barton as his successor; his principal concern was to keep Isaacs out.<br>
<br>Griffith had a happy family life. His marriage was close and secure; and correspondence between husband and wife reveals, beneath Griffith's seemingly aloof and cold exterior, an emotional warmth and care for his wife and children (two sons and four daughters). The family lived principally in Brisbane, from 1880 at Merthyr, an imposing house built for them at New Farm on the Brisbane River, although Griffiths lived at Sydney while on the High Court, making only annual visits to Brisbane. Outside the law, Griffith was an active freemason; he played a role in the administration of Brisbane schools, and was interested in the establishment and early development of the University of Queensland. He was also a member of the senate of the University of Sydney from 1904 to 1917. He was awarded honorary LLD degrees by the University of Queensland in 1912 and the University of Wales in 1913. An unusual interest was in Dante, and he published a translation of the <span class="italic">Divina commedia</span> in 1914. It was very literal, lacking in poetic feeling, but it throws an interesting light on the interests of its author. He was made a KCMG in 1886, promoted GCMG in 1895, and was sworn of the privy council in 1901, sitting on its judicial committee when in England in 1913.<br>
<br>Griffith died at Merthyr on 9 August 1920, from cerebral haemorrhage, congestion of lungs, heart failure, and arteriosclerosis. He was buried in Toowong cemetery, Brisbane. His estate was valued for probate in Australia at &pound;27,335. A suburb in Canberra and a university in Brisbane are named after him.<br>
