<span class="headword">Ashbridge, Sir  Noel</span>  (1889&#150;1975), <span class="occ">broadcasting engineer</span>, was born on 10 December 1889 in Wanstead, Essex, the fourth son and youngest child of John Ashbridge, solicitor, of Wanstead, and his wife, Sylvia Moore. He was educated at Forest School, Snaresbrook, Essex, and King's College, London, where he graduated in engineering.<br>
<br>Following graduation he spent a period of engineering training with Yarrow &amp; Co., and British Thomson&#150;Houston, before entering service with the Royal Fusiliers in 1914. In 1916 he was commissioned in the Royal Engineers and was one of the first operators of wireless equipment in the front line in France. Later in the war he transferred to instructional and research work in telecommunications.<br>
<br>In 1919 he joined the Marconi Company as one of the wireless development team at Writtle in Essex, which, early in 1922, constructed the famous 2MT (Two Emma Tock) transmitter, from which the first wireless entertainment programmes were broadcast, before the formation of the BBC at the end of the same year. Five members of this team were soon to join the BBC and assume senior engineering positions: among these were Peter Eckersley, who became the BBC's first chief engineer in February 1923, and Ashbridge himself, who joined Eckersley as assistant chief engineer in January 1926. Three years later, in 1929, he succeeded Eckersley as chief engineer. On 17 July 1926 he married Olive Maude (<i>d</i>. 1948), daughter of Rowland Strickland, merchant, of Erith, Kent. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>The next few years saw a rapid expansion of the BBC's engineering activities under Ashbridge's guidance and his achievement was recognized with a knighthood in 1935. He had already, in 1934, been made a knight of the Danish royal order of Dannebrog for his work in advising a number of European countries on the setting up of broadcasting services.<br>
<br>At about this time the possibility of television broadcasting was coming to the fore and he was a member of the 1934 Selsdon committee investigating this. In 1935 Ashbridge saw and approved a demonstration of the all-electronic television system invented by Isaac Shoenberg and this resulted in the following year in the establishment by the BBC of the world's first regular high-definition television service.<br>
<br>The Second World War years brought new responsibilities for Ashbridge and the BBC engineering departments under his direction. Radio broadcasting had a vital role to play in terms of information and maintenance of public morale, both within Britain and overseas, and this had to be effected while offering the least possible opportunity for enemy aircraft to use the transmissions for navigational purposes. The television service was closed down for the duration of the war, but some planning had to be done for its future resumption and Ashbridge was a member of the 1943 committee set up for this purpose under the chairmanship of Sir Maurice Hankey.<br>
<br>In 1943 Ashbridge was appointed deputy director-general of the BBC, while maintaining a role as chief adviser on engineering matters. With a reorganization of senior management in 1948, he relinquished the post of deputy director-general and was appointed director of technical services. In this position he supervised the very rapid and far-reaching expansion of radio and television services in the immediate post-war years. This period also saw the re-establishment and extension of international co-operation in the broadcasting field, and in 1950 Ashbridge was the BBC engineering division representative at an international meeting in Torquay which formed the start of the European Broadcasting Union.<br>
<br>During the war years he had been elected president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers for the 1941&#150;2 term, and in 1948, with Harold Bishop, he delivered its Faraday lecture on the subject of television. He retired from the BBC in 1952 after twenty-six years' service. Following this, he spent seven years on the board of the Marconi Company.<br>
<br>Throughout his career, Ashbridge was breaking new ground, his decisions forming the basis for the pattern of broadcast engineering that was later adopted. As a man he was quiet, precise, and modest, tackling all problems with common sense and realism. He applied himself with the highest professional standards, and demanded the same of his colleagues in the BBC engineering division.<br>
<br>Outside the professional sphere Ashbridge was a man of broad interests, a sailor, a keen follower of cricket, and a lover of music. Nevertheless, his abiding concern was with engineering matters, and the years spent in a more diffuse field as deputy director-general were not wholly to his taste. As a leader he was much liked and respected, in return showing equal respect for his staff at all levels. He was certainly intolerant of carelessness and insincerity, but was always ready with advice and encouragement when needed. The excellence of the engineering effected under his direction bears witness to his capacity for extracting the best from his colleagues. Ashbridge died on 4 June 1975 at Birchwood House, a nursing home in Speldhurst, Kent.<br>
