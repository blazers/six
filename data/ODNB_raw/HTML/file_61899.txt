<span class="headword">Wurm,  Mary Josephine Agnes <span class="st"> [Marie]</span></span>  (1860&#150;1938), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 18 May 1860 at 11 Windsor Terrace, Southampton, the first of the ten children of John Evangelist Wurm (<i>c</i>.1828&#150;1892), formerly of Oberdorf, Bavaria, and his wife, (Marie) Sophie Niggl (<i>c</i>.1838&#150;<i>c</i>.1883), daughter of a village schoolmaster from Denklingen. The couple, both music teachers, had emigrated to Southampton on the advice of one of Sophie's elder sisters, Josephine, herself a music teacher recently settled in the city, who was the wife of Lorenz Herkomer and mother of the artist Hubert Herkomer. The Wurms set up house next door to the Herkomers in Windsor Terrace, but soon moved to Portland Street. Besides teaching German and music peripatetically, J. E. Wurm was organist and choirmaster of St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Bugle Street, for more than thirty years. Sophie Wurm taught singing, the violin, the piano, and the zither. Ambitious and well organized, she took the major share in promoting her children's interests. All ten were said to be musical. In addition to Mary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75531/', "Mathilde Verne (1865&#150;1936)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76416/', "Alice Barbara Verne (1868&#150;1958)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75532/', "Adela Verne (1877&#150;1952)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75531/', "Verne, Mathilde")</script>] had professional musical careers. These three changed their surname from Wurm to Verne late in 1893 and worked chiefly in England, whereas Mary, often known in English sources as Marie Wurm, lived and worked mainly in Germany.<br>
<br>Mary was taken by her mother to Stuttgart in 1869, becoming a pupil at the conservatory. After returning to London in 1878, she had lessons from visiting pianists including Anna Mehlig, Mary Krebs, J&oacute;zef Wieniawski, and Caroline Montigny-R&eacute;maury. In 1880 she went to Frankfurt to study with Clara Schumann and Joachim Raff; she eventually made her London d&eacute;but in 1882 at the Crystal Palace under August Manns, playing Robert Schumann's piano concerto. Two years later she appeared at the St James's Hall &#145;Popular&#146; concerts (in a Haydn trio) and won the Mendelssohn scholarship, which provided for composition studies with Sir Arthur Sullivan, C. V. Stanford, and Frederick Bridge; in 1886 she studied with Carl Reinecke in Leipzig. From this period solo playing gave way to chamber music, at the Princes' Hall in London as well as in Vienna and Frankfurt. Mary Wurm &#145;assisted&#146; at concerts of such leading performers as Sophie L&ouml;we, Ben Davies, and Tivadar Nachez, often playing her own works. Meanwhile she established a teaching connection in Germany. Her most remarkable solo appearance was undoubtedly that at the Queen's Hall, London, on 21 February 1895&#151;an entirely extempore programme based on musical themes supplied by the audience and in sealed envelopes from &#145;music professors&#146;. Described as clever but musically dull, the occasion was not repeated, and she returned to composition and teaching in Germany, notably in Hanover, Berlin (from 1911), Munich (from 1925), and later Berlin again. From 1898 to 1900 she conducted and toured with a women's orchestra in Germany. She died in Munich on 21 January 1938.<br>
<br>Wurm was a fluent composer of parlour songs and light piano works, many of them dances or duets, as well as women's part-songs and children's pieces designed for ready markets in Germany and Britain. These included a children's operetta <span class="italic">Prinzessin Lisa's Fee</span> (given in L&uuml;beck, 1890) and two didactic works, <span class="italic">Das ABC der Musik</span> (Leipzig, n.d.) and <span class="italic">Praktische Vorschule zur Caland-Lehre</span> (Hanover, 1914). She also wrote a piano concerto, a violin sonata (op. 17), a cello sonata, a string quartet (op. 40), works for string orchestra, and a one-act opera after Goethe's <span class="italic">Die Mitschuldigen</span> (given in Leipzig, 1921).<br>
