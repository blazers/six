<span class="headword">Spencer,  (William) George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1790, <em>d.</em> 1866), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was baptized on 8 February 1790 in the parish of St Werburgh, Derby, the son of Wesleyan Methodists, Matthew Spencer (1762&#150;1831), a schoolmaster, and his wife, Catherine Taylor (1758&#150;1843). Spencer was the eldest of five surviving brothers and a sister; he was known as George after the birth of his youngest brother, also William. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26138/', "Thomas Spencer (1796&#150;1853)")</script>, a Cambridge mathematics wrangler, became notable as a social reformer. Spencer was educated at his father's school, where he also started to follow his father's career, including work from 1807 as a private tutor in the Derby area.<br>
<br>In his twenties Spencer ran his own private school alongside his private tutoring. He taught a wide range of subjects, including English language, arithmetic, accounts, drawing, algebra, geometry, mechanics, astronomy, and the sciences. Such subjects were not part of the normal classics-based, public-school curriculum and Spencer's teaching business thrived. Further income came from some inherited and purchased property. He advanced his own informal education through political, social, religious, and ethical discussions with his brothers and other acquaintances. In mathematics, the sciences, and medicine he also benefited from the meetings and literature of the Derby Philosophical Society, for which he acted as honorary secretary from his mid-twenties.<br>
<br>Spencer married Harriet Holmes (1794&#150;1867), the daughter of a plumber and glazier, on 6 January 1819 and they first lived at 12 Exeter Row, Derby. It was not a happy relationship. He commanded attention through his physical presence, being a well-built man about 6 feet tall, his abundant energy and strength of character, displaying independence and originality, and his notable lack of reticence. By contrast, she was gentle, conforming, and conservative. Of nine children only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36208/', "Herbert Spencer (1820&#150;1903)")</script>, the eldest, survived beyond infancy to become a well-known philosopher and sociologist.<br>
<br>Pressure of work gradually affected the balance of Spencer's mind and, in 1824, forced him temporarily to give up teaching. The family moved to New Radford, near Nottingham, and Spencer became involved with the then new lace-manufacturing business. This commercial venture failed and, in 1827, the Spencers moved to 8 (later 17) Wilmot Street, Derby, where they remained and Spencer resumed private tutoring.<br>
<br>Spencer's historical significance rests on two related aspects of his teaching: his seminal contribution to pedagogy; and his influence on his son Herbert's intellectual development. Herbert's autobiography (2 vols., 1904) is permeated with references to his father's contributions to his developing thought and tributes to his father's individuality, inventiveness, and idealism. Spencer's pedagogy was based on respect for pupils, motivation, and active rather than passive learning to promote understanding, as opposed to rote memorizing. This self-help method of teaching through guided discovery was eventually exemplified as <span class="italic">Inventional geometry: a series of questions, problems, and explanations, intended to familiarize the pupil with geometrical conceptions, to exercise his inventive faculty, and prepare him for Euclid and the higher mathematics</span> (1860). This small work of thirty-two pages on practical geometry was over thirty years ahead of its time in England; it was first reprinted through his son's efforts in 1892. As early as the 1870s, an American edition made some impact in the USA. The pedagogy gained prominence in England during the 1900s, when the use of editions of Euclid for school geometry was eventually abandoned.<br>
<br>Spencer also had some artistic talent and his inventiveness extended to the elaboration, over much of his life, of a new system of shorthand. Again through his son's efforts, this work was posthumously published as <span class="italic">A System of Lucid Shorthand</span> (1893). Spencer died of a lung infection and an overdose of morphia, on 27 April 1866 at 17 Wilmot Street, Derby.<br>
