<span class="headword">Dawson,  Robert Kearsley</span>  (1798&#150;1861), <span class="occ">surveyor and cartographer</span>, was born in Dover in 1798 while his father, the surveyor and cartographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7354/', "Robert Dawson (1771&#150;1860)")</script>, was employed on the survey of Kent. He was one of eight children born to Robert and his wife, Jane Budgen, and one of three sons to become surveyors. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and obtained his first commission in the Royal Engineers in 1818. He was assistant to Thomas Colby on the triangulation of Scotland and later accompanied Colby to Ireland, where, in 1829, he supervised a staff of civil assistants who sketched hills for the one-inch map and collected material for the county memoirs to the six-inch survey. In 1831 he was recalled to England and appointed commissioner under the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> to settle and map the boundaries of parliamentary boroughs, producing maps mostly at scales of one and two inches to the mile in <span class="italic">Plans of the Cities and Boroughs of England and Wales</span> (2 vols., 1832). His maps at scales of one and two inches to the mile predate Ordnance Survey maps in the north of the country. In 1836 Dawson became assistant commissioner to the tithe commutation commission, organizing and superintending the surveys on which the permanent commutation of tithes in England and Wales was to be recorded. While employed on this work he also gave advice to the directors of the Wakefield settlements in New Zealand and Australia who were establishing colonies on principles laid out by Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Dawson successfully advocated cheaper but less accurate running surveys in preference to strict trigonometric surveys. Although he favoured the technically superior trigonometric surveys where practicable, as with his own tithe commutation maps, Dawson realized that running surveys would serve the overriding need of the colonists&#151;to prove title to land&#151;without being so costly as to delay settlement. He published his views in a pamphlet <span class="italic">Report on Surveying &hellip; with Reference to New Zealand and &hellip; the Colonies Generally</span> (1840). Dawson's experience in Ireland and the Antipodes convinced him of the value of cadastral maps (large-scale maps showing property boundaries) and he argued persuasively that the scope of the English and Welsh tithe survey and mapping should be extended to form a national survey at a scale of one inch to three chains (26.7 inches to a mile, or 1:2376). Despite having won over the tithe and poor law commissioners, his argument found no favour with the exchequer and Britain thus remained without a general cadastral map. None the less, the tithe maps, many drawn to Dawson's specifications, constitute an impressive cartographic achievement. He was appointed assistant commissioner and head of the survey department of the commons enclosure and copyhold commission and for his services was made CB civil division in February 1836. He reached the rank of colonel before his death at 4 Grove Place, Blackheath, on 28 March 1861. He left a widow, Frances Jane, but nothing more is known of his family circumstances.<br>
