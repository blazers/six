<span class="headword">Bagwell,  Richard</span>  (1840&#150;1918), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 9 December 1840 in Marlfield House, Clonmel, co. Tipperary. He was the eldest son of John Bagwell, MP for Clonmel (1857&#150;74), and his wife, Frances Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Prittie. He had one brother and four sisters. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1866. On 9 January 1873 he married Harriette Philippa Newton; they had one son and three daughters. He never practised as a lawyer but returned to live in Ireland, where he succeeded his father as owner of Marlfield House in 1883.<br>
<br>Bagwell believed in the positive contribution which resident Irish landlords made to Irish society and participated fully in local government in co. Tipperary. He was elected high sheriff of the county in 1869 and subsequently served as justice of the peace, magistrate, and foreman of the grand jury for co. Tipperary. In 1898 he was appointed a member of the Local Government Board, whose task was to supervise the implementation of the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of that year. He was also a founding member of the Irish Loyal and Patriotic Union (ILPU), an organization of southern unionists formed in 1885 to resist home rule for Ireland and he remained a prominent member of the ILPU and the later Irish Unionist Alliance until his death in 1918. In the 1880s and 1890s he attended many public meetings in England, speaking in favour of the union, and he wrote pamphlets for the Irish Unionist Alliance, although most of these were published anonymously and none can now be attributed to him.<br>
<br>It was during the years before he took over the running of the Marlfield estate in 1883 that Bagwell did much of the research for <span class="italic">Ireland under the Tudors</span> (3 vols., 1885&#150;90). He made use of the printed calendars of state papers in the first volume but the second volume required a considerable amount of research in the Public Record Office in London. Unionist business must have absorbed a great deal of his time in the 1880s and 1890s but he still continued his historical research. Research for the third volume was completed in between attending public meetings in England. His involvement in public affairs also helps to explain why <span class="italic">Ireland under the Stuarts</span> (3 vols., 1909&#150;16) was not as satisfactory in terms of research as the Tudor volumes. Apart from his six volumes on Tudor and Stuart Ireland, his only other major historical work was to contribute entries on seventeenth-century Irish subjects to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>From the first appearance of <span class="italic">Ireland under the Tudors</span> in 1885, Bagwell earned a reputation for objectivity and impartiality as a historian, a judgement which seems curiously at odds with his political commitment to unionism and landlord power in Ireland. A close analysis of his historical writings reveals, however, that he shared with W. E. H. Lecky a concern to refute James Anthony Froude's interpretation of Irish history. Froude's polemical views on Irish history, which he expressed first in his <span class="italic">History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada</span> (1856&#150;70) and later in <span class="italic">The English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1881), had shocked many people in Ireland, particularly the intellectual &eacute;lite within the Anglo-Irish community. Froude had made clear his contempt for the historical legacy of the Anglo-Irish, holding them and their ancestors responsible for what he perceived to be the chaotic state of nineteenth-century Ireland. W. E. H. Lecky, Bagwell, and G. H. Orpen all wrote their histories partly in response to Froude and all three endeavoured to restore the reputation of the Anglo-Irish as fair and responsible rulers whose presence assisted rather than hindered the development of law and order in Ireland.<br>
<br>Bagwell's support for the union as the most equitable system of government for Ireland never wavered. In 1917 he was prominent among those who opposed the compromise agreement of the southern unionist representatives at the Irish convention which allowed for a scheme for the government of Ireland. He died at Marlfield House on 4 December 1918 at the age of seventy-seven. In 1923 Marlfield House was burnt by republican forces in the Irish civil war. The fire destroyed both his library and his historical papers.<br>
