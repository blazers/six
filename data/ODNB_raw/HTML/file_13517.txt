<span class="headword">Holland,  Cornelius</span>  (1600&#150;1671?), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, the eldest son of Ralph Holland (1581&#150;1625), Merchant Taylor, of London, and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1634), was born at St Laurence Pountney, London, on 3 March 1600; his family may have been that which had been prominent in the Merchant Taylors' Company since the fifteenth century. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School from 1610 and Pembroke College, Cambridge, between 1614 and 1618. By 1627 he had married his wife, Sybill, shortly after which he moved to the parish of St Margaret, Westminster. This was occasioned by his having entered court service under Sir Henry Vane senior, and may have been effected through contacts forged by his own father, groom of the robes under Elizabeth and James. By 1626 he was a clerk in the cofferer's office, before becoming clerk of the acatry, and, by 1636, clerk comptroller of the household of the prince of Wales. In 1638&#150;41 he acted as paymaster and clerk of the greencloth in the prince's court. Perhaps as a result of his refusal to provide money to finance the first bishops' war in 1639 he was replaced as cofferer in early 1641, although he remained clerk of the greencloth until at least the end of the year.<br>
<br>Holland was elected to the Long Parliament for New Windsor, and although the election was voided he succeeded in securing the seat at the second poll. He rapidly emerged as a prominent advocate of &#145;further reformation&#146; in religion, and was prominent enough to be appointed to the &#145;recess&#146; committee in 1641. Thereafter he emerged as a member of the war party in politics, hostile to negotiating with Charles other than from a position of great strength. He was undoubtedly motivated by religious zeal, in addition to which he displayed a pronounced political radicalism. It was these factors that led him to support parliament in the war, rather than the craven desire for self-advancement and financial gain that has generally been ascribed to him.<br>
<br>By 1643 Holland, along with men such as Henry Marten, was styled one of the &#145;fiery spirits&#146; in the Commons. He was named to many of the most powerful committees, and became heavily involved in raising money for the war effort, and in the prosecution of delinquents. The issue with which he would become most clearly connected was the welfare of those who suffered most for their zeal in the war effort, in terms of maimed soldiers and their families. As an experienced courtier he was also involved in the care of the king's children, and this, together with an ongoing involvement in negotiations with the elector palatine, may indicate his willingness to consider replacing Charles with another king. On one occasion in late 1648 he was reported as having made a virulent speech against the Stuart monarchy, and in favour of banishing Charles. He also emerged as an opponent of a presbyterian church settlement, and a supporter of Independent &#145;dissenting brethren&#146; and of toleration. By late 1648 he was perceived as being associated with the Levellers. He supported the army remonstrance calling for the king to be brought to justice, and may have been involved in planning Pride's Purge. He was certainly involved in preparing the king's trial, and attended its meetings assiduously. Although labelled a regicide for having been present on the day of sentencing, he did not sign the death warrant, which perhaps offers further evidence of his reticence to sanction the king's execution, if not his removal from power [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>Holland was extremely active on the first two councils of state (1649&#150;50), as well as on the fourth (1651&#150;2), and displayed enthusiasm for selling land and property of both crown and church. Thereafter he appears to have become disillusioned with political developments and the dominance of the army. There is little evidence that he opposed the protectorate, which he appears to have been willing to accommodate, but he was largely inactive in the mid-1650s. He may have sought election to Cromwell's parliament of 1656, but he was not returned, and only resumed his political work during the return of the Rump in 1659, when he was appointed to the committee of safety. After renewed army pressure in October, however, he withdrew from parliament. At the Restoration he fled to the continent, initially to the Low Countries, but by 1662 was with other regicides in Lausanne and Vevey under the alias John Ralfeson. There, he was free to exercise his dissenting beliefs in peace. He was clearly ill by early 1671, and probably died later in the same year.<br>
