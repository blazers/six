<span class="headword">Dixon, Sir  Robert Bland</span>  (1867&#150;1939), <span class="occ">engineer and naval officer</span>, was born on 30 March 1867 at Darlington, the elder son of Robert Bland Dixon, architect and surveyor, and his wife, Mary Ann Whitecomb (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Parr). He was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32841/', "Walter Ernest Dixon")</script>, a pharmacologist. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Darlington, and at the Royal Naval Engineering College at Keyham, then recently established, and was in fact the first student of the college to reach the head of his profession. In 1888 he passed for further training to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, with the rank of assistant engineer (the equivalent of sub-lieutenant). His first year's progress qualified him for an additional two years' study and for specialization in machinery design and the more scientific side of his profession, with only sea service required to qualify him for successive steps of promotion.<br>
<br>On leaving Greenwich in 1891 Dixon joined the <i>Hecla</i>, one of the earliest repair ships, in the Mediterranean. A special feature of her equipment was the carriage of a flotilla of &#145;second-class torpedo boats&#146; which were hoisted out and exercised together, and provided the initial experience in the evolution of destroyers and destroyer tactics. On promotion to engineer in 1892 he was sent to the battleship <i>Trafalgar</i>, and in 1893 to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, as instructor in applied mechanics to assist J. H. Cotterill. Dixon married in 1896 Hettie Alice (<i>d</i>. 1936), daughter of Dr Frank Sextus Tuck, of Aylesford, Kent. There were no children.<br>
<br>After two years' service on the China station in the <i>Centurion</i> (1896&#150;8) Dixon went home and was posted successively to Chatham Dockyard as assistant to the chief engineer (1899), to the Admiralty, to Portsmouth as first assistant to the engineer manager (1902), and, in 1904, soon after his promotion to chief engineer, he joined the staff of the director of dockyards.<br>
<br>In that same year, owing to the change in naval titles then introduced, Dixon became engineer commander, and as such he spent his last spell of sea service in the battleship <i>Dominion</i> during 1907 and 1908. By then he was recognized by both his seniors and juniors as an exceptionally capable and popular officer, and after three years at Haulbowline yard as chief engineer he was appointed engineer manager of Portsmouth yard in 1912.<br>
<br>Dixon held this post until 1917, having been promoted engineer captain in 1915, a period which gave his powers of organization and technical judgement a full test on account of the great increase in both men and machinery demanded by first the threat and second the outbreak of war. He left Portsmouth in order to become assistant director of dockyards, and he remained at Whitehall until his retirement in 1928, being successively assistant engineer (1919), deputy engineer (1920), and, in succession to Sir George Goodwin, engineer-in-chief of the fleet in 1922, receiving then the usual promotion from engineer rear-admiral (1919) to engineer vice-admiral on appointment.<br>
<br>On retirement in 1928, Dixon became chairman and director of several engineering firms, notably of Messrs Babcock and Wilcox. He was an active member of several technical societies and was president in 1926 of the Junior Institute of Engineers, and in 1929 of the Institute of Marine Engineers. He served on the privy council committee of scientific and industrial research. He took a keen and continuous interest in engineering education, and served on the committee on the training of naval cadets under the chairmanship of Sir Reginald Custance in 1912, and on the education committee of the Mechanical Engineers.<br>
<br>Although no spectacular advance marked Dixon's tenure of high office comparable with the introduction of the water tube boiler and the steam turbine, the British lead in Admiralty engineering was fully maintained. In the <i>Kent</i> class, designed to embody the experience of the First World War and to meet the growing menace from the air, the &#145;unit&#146; system, whereby each propeller can have, as required, its own independent supply of steam, with high pressures and temperatures, was, after long opposition, introduced in the <i>Nelson</i> and the <i>Rodney</i> and later became almost universal in all important vessels. The cure of &#145;condenseritis&#146; was achieved after prolonged tests by the use of cupro-nickel tubes, while the introduction of corrugated steam-pipes to provide for expansion successfully met a difficulty in spite of opposition from competent opinion. Another development was the use of electric drive at cruising speeds for auxiliary machinery, but of steam drive with independence of the vulnerable &#145;ringmain&#146; when in action.<br>
<br>At a time when the German navy had adopted the diesel engine&#151;notably in the <i>Deutschland</i> and <i>Graf von Spee</i>&#151;and the United States had done the same in the <i>Maryland</i> and others, it was largely owing to the representations of Dixon that despite persistent and repeated pressure the Royal Navy retained its faith in the steam turbine, a faith fully justified, since both countries reverted to British practice. Further, during Dixon's term of office there largely disappeared the lack of understanding and contact between seagoing engineer officers and the higher engineer officers at the Admiralty of which the former had long been conscious.<br>
<br>Dixon was a man of quiet and retiring disposition, with great tenacity of character. He rarely thrust his views forward, but was always ready, when called upon, with a well weighed and considered opinion. He was appointed CB on leaving Portsmouth in 1918 and KCB in 1924. The University of Sheffield conferred upon him the honorary degree of DEng in 1926. He died at St Luke's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, while on a business visit for Messrs Babcock and Wilcox, on 28 July 1939.<br>
