<span class="headword">Lees,  Frederic Richard</span>  (1815&#150;1897), <span class="occ">temperance advocate</span>, was born on 15 March 1815 at Meanwood, near Leeds, the only child of Joseph Lees (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1845), who conducted a school there, and his first wife, Anne (1796&#150;1815), the daughter of Ephraim Sanderson of Aberford, also a schoolmaster. Joseph Lees remarried in 1816 and had nine children with his second wife, Isabella Bickerdyke. Prominent in local radical circles, he served as secretary of the Leeds Political Union in 1832. He sent his eldest son to Mr Compton's school in Bury (1825&#150;8), and then articled him to a solicitor named Wailes in Leeds (1828&#150;36).<br>
<br>Lees made his living as a temperance writer, editor, and speaker. One of the pioneers of teetotalism in the north of England, he took a pledge against drinking any kind of alcohol in 1835. Two years later he became joint secretary of the British Association for the Promotion of Temperance. From 1840 to 1844 he edited and published the <span class="italic">British Temperance Advocate and Journal</span>, and from 1844 to 1850 edited the <span class="italic">Truth Seeker</span>. In 1854 the new United Kingdom Alliance appointed him as a travelling secretary. Two years later Lees won the prize that the alliance offered for the best statement of the case for prohibition, published as the <span class="italic">Alliance prize essay, or, An argument, legal and historical, for the legislative prohibition of the liquor traffic</span>.<br>
<br>Despite frequent ill health Lees wrote incessantly. His principal books and shorter publications were reprinted as <span class="italic">The Selected Works</span> (8 vols., 1884&#150;7) and <span class="italic">The True Thinker</span> (6 vols., 1891&#150;7). Lees emphasized secular and scientific arguments against alcoholic drink. To enhance his position as the philosopher of temperance, he styled himself Doctor after 1842, when he received an honorary degree from a minor German university.<br>
<br>Intense and inflexible, Lees often courted controversy. As a young man he offended the orthodox by challenging the inerrancy of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and in the 1840s flirted with pantheism. Ironically, he died a member of the Church of England. He irritated traditionalists by his demand, as early as the 1840s, that non-intoxicating grape juice be used in the eucharistic sacrament. With Dawson Burns he published <span class="italic">The Temperance Bible Commentary</span> (1868) to establish that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> never sanctioned fermented wine. Lees was forced to resign his alliance office in 1858 after he had accused the English-born American temperance reformer John Gough of being a secret drinker, and Gough sued him for libel. Radical in his political views, Lees upset many reformers when his independent candidacy at Leeds helped bring about the defeat of the incumbent Liberal MP, Edward Baines, in 1874. Lees headed a minority faction of the Good Templar fraternal temperance organization in the British Isles during a worldwide schism. He had joined the templars in 1869 while on a lecture tour in the United States, a year after Joseph Malins organized the first English lodge. Lees denounced the secession that Malins instigated in 1876. Malins claimed to be fighting for the right of black people in the American south to join the templar society, but Lees, an old abolitionist, regarded the real motive as a grab for power. Lees and Malins became adversaries in an expensive, acrimonious, and protracted law suit.<br>
<br>Lees enjoyed a happy family life. In 1838 he married Mercy Joanna Jowett (<i>d</i>. 1870), the daughter of a Leeds printer; they had two children, Frederic Arnold (1847&#150;1921), a physician, surgeon, and botanist, and Mary Eleanor, who later married Freeman Whatmoor. On 25 September 1878 he married Mrs Sarah Barnesley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brooks, of Manchester, who died in 1889 at the age of fifty-eight. He lived most of his adult life at Meanwood, near Leeds, but he died at 1 Park Road, Halifax, on 29 May 1897. He was buried at Meanwood on 1 June. His son, Frederic Arnold Lees, contributed an introduction to the biography written by (George) Frederic William Lees (<i>b</i>. 1872), perhaps his son or a son of one of F. R. Lees's half-brothers.<br>
