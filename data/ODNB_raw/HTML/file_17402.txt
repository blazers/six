<span class="headword">McCosh,  James</span>  (1811&#150;1894), <span class="occ">philosopher and college head</span>, was born at the family home, Carskeoch, Patna, Ayrshire, on 1 April 1811, the fifth of seven children of Andrew McCosh, farmer, and his wife, Jean, daughter of James Carson, farmer. McCosh grew up at Carskeoch, in an area with a long history of defiant protestantism. He received religious inspiration from both parents and regularly walked with them the several miles to the Straiton parish church. Andrew McCosh died when James was nine, and, an older brother having died at the age of three, James was the only male family member left to work the farm.<br>
<br>McCosh attended the local parish school and in 1824 entered Glasgow University. In 1829 he began his studies for the ministry at Edinburgh University. He became closely attached to Thomas Chalmers, in the chair of divinity, and also acquainted with David Welsh, professor of church history. The philosopher Sir William Hamilton also taught at Edinburgh and McCosh became absorbed in his writings. He received his master of arts degree from Edinburgh in 1834 and was licensed by the presbytery of Ayr (26 March 1834) as a member of the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>In October 1835 McCosh began his ministry at the abbey church of Arbroath on the eastern coast of Scotland. Here he attended to a heavily working-class parish. Shortly, he began a collaboration with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11790/', "Thomas Guthrie")</script> of nearby Brechin. Guthrie had joined other evangelicals in the fight against patronage in the national church. In January 1839 McCosh became minister of the cathedral church of Brechin. He now made the movement for complete separation of church and state his main cause. At St Andrew's Church in Edinburgh, on 18 May 1843, McCosh joined Chalmers, Welsh, and Guthrie in seceding from the general assembly meeting and reconvening to form the Free Church of Scotland. He was from 1844 to 1851 minister of the East Free Church, Brechin. On 29 September 1845 McCosh married Isabella Guthrie (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of Alexander Guthrie, older brother of Thomas and a noted physician. They had five children: Mary Jane (<i>b</i>. 1846), Andrew (1848&#150;1849), Alexander Guthrie (<i>b</i>. 1850), Margaret Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1852), and Andrew James (<i>b</i>. 1858).<br>
<br>McCosh's interest in philosophy led to the publication in 1850 of his first book, <span class="italic">The Method of the Divine Government, Physical and Moral</span>. The book was read and admired by the earl of Clarendon, lord lieutenant of Ireland, and helped secure McCosh's appointment (14 November 1851) as professor of logic and metaphysics at the newly established Queen's College, Belfast. In philosophy McCosh sought a viable middle ground between what he considered an overzealous intuitionism that cannot validate a real world, and a strenuous materialism that honours no spiritual reality. He confronted these problems within the tradition of Scottish philosophy. He praised Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart for defending the truths of consciousness but faulted them for not successfully connecting them with a world of experience. He believed that Thomas Brown had left philosophy in a similarly dubious state by restricting it to the immediately knowable, the laws of the mind itself. He praised Hamilton, however, for insisting that we do not know attributes without knowing substance. In <span class="italic">The Intuitions of the Mind, Inductively Investigated</span> (1860) McCosh sought to demonstrate that all intuitions are of something and that they must connect to experience. His &#145;intuitional realism&#146; thus stayed within the general thematic emphasis of the Scottish school but his more emphatic empiricism gave McCosh his distinct place in it. On the other hand, McCosh believed that Hamilton's negative idea of the absolute had damaging implications for religious belief. McCosh paid his highest respects to Scottish philosophy in <span class="italic">The Scottish Philosophy, Biographical, Expository, Critical, from Hutcheson to Hamilton</span> (1875). It remains a useful intellectual history.<br>
<br>In 1868 McCosh accepted an invitation to become president of the College of New Jersey (Princeton) in the United States; he delivered his inaugural speech on 27 October that year. He had become well known in certain quarters of America, particularly in the protestant religious press, where his books were widely reviewed and often praised for making a useful alliance with Christianity. At Princeton he announced his intention to open the college to new areas of learning. He modernized the curriculum and expanded the faculty. McCosh held two public debates with Charles William Eliot, president of Harvard and major defender of the elective system. Free choice, McCosh said, would enable students to bypass not just the ancient classics but the modern sciences, now a necessary component of the higher learning.<br>
<br>McCosh proved to be a successful academic politician at Princeton. He made new connections with wealthy Presbyterians who welcomed his effort to transform Princeton from a provincial college to a national university. On several occasions he called on such individuals to provide money to support new academic programmes or buildings. He worked with Princeton alumni to establish new chapters around the United States as he sought to broaden the geographical base of the student body. McCosh also won the support and affection of a group of students, whom he called &#145;me bright young men&#146;, and who shared his vision of a renewed Princeton. Woodrow Wilson&#151;in the class of 1879 and editor of the student newspaper <span class="italic">The Princetonian</span>&#151;championed McCosh's causes.<br>
<br>Although he maintained a strict moral regime at Princeton and made religion prominent at the college, McCosh's liberal views on evolution brought him enemies. His writings on science had begun at Queen's and there his work with George Dickie had led to a co-authored book, <span class="italic">Typical Forms and Special Ends in Creation</span> (1855). Their discussions of &#145;collocation&#146; and &#145;homologies&#146; outlined a dynamic teleological process at work in nature and prepared McCosh's receptivity to all theories of evolution, including Darwin's. But some individuals in Princeton's board of trustees denounced McCosh for his accommodationist stance. By 1880 he felt frustrated with the reactionary temper of the trustees and prevailed in his quest to have an alumni trustee position created. Furthermore, in a significant reversal, McCosh, determined to see the success of his changes at Princeton, began appointing to faculty positions some of his best former students, several of whom became noted scholars.<br>
<br>To friend and foe alike McCosh was a commanding figure at the college. His tall and imposing physique had become stooped in his older years, but students flatteringly attributed that posture to his scholarly habits. He sported lengthy sideburns and spoke with a rough Scottish brogue that gave piquancy to his speech. A proud man, he boasted unabashedly of his accomplishments at Princeton, where the students gave him the nickname Old Jimmie. Always referring to &#145;me college&#146;, he would escort visitors to Princeton around the campus, pointing at new buildings and saying &#145;that's mine; I built that&#146;. Students who might at first have found him intimidating soon learned to see through his &#145;big bow-wow&#146;, as one of them called it. Many later remembered his personal kindness toward them. McCosh resigned the presidency in June 1888, but continued teaching. He died at his college home, in Princeton, New Jersey, on 16 November 1894 and was buried in the president's plot at the college on 20 November.<br>
