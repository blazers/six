</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Courtney,  Leonard Henry</span>, Baron Courtney of Penwith  (1832&#150;1918), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, eldest son of the nine children of John Sampson Courtney (<i>d</i>. 1881), banker, of Alfreston House, Penzance, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1859), daughter of John Mortimer, was born at Penzance on 6 July 1832 and was baptized on 3 October 1832. He attended a local school and then worked for six years in Bolitho's Bank at Penzance. A local doctor taught him classics and mathematics in the evenings and he won a sizarship at St John's College, Cambridge. Courtney's university career was distinguished: he became second wrangler (1855), Smith's prizeman, and fellow of his college. In 1857 he went to London and in 1858 was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. After six years as a briefless barrister and freelance journalist&#151;the latter being his real interest&#151;he became in 1865 a leader writer for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, where J. T. Delane was the editor. During the next sixteen years he wrote some three thousand articles for the paper, and helped it maintain a Liberal patina as it drifted towards Conservatism. Courtney also contributed sixteen articles for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, mostly on political and economic topics. He became a close friend of its editor, John Morley.<br>
<br>From 1872 to 1875 Courtney was professor of political economy at University College, London. His political economy was not that of a thoroughgoing Liberal, for in the 1890s he sympathized with bimetallism, but he was always a free-trader. In 1874 he stood unsuccessfully as parliamentary candidate for Liskeard, in opposition to E. Horsman, also standing as a Liberal, though with tory support; Courtney lost in a vicious campaign by five votes. On Horsman's death in 1876, he won the by-election and held the seat until 1885. In the Commons he was attached to the radical group centred around Joseph Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke. In 1880 W. E. Gladstone made him under-secretary for the Home Office and in 1881 he succeeded Sir M. Grant-Duff as under-secretary for the colonies, an appointment made in the face of strong opposition from Queen Victoria, for Courtney already had a reputation as an anti-imperialist. In May 1882 his favour with Gladstone was confirmed by his appointment as financial secretary to the Treasury in succession to Lord Frederick Cavendish.<br>
<br>Courtney was thus quickly launched on a promising political career, but one which relied on executive ability, for he from the first often irritated the Commons by his portentous and long-winded speeches, which reflected the worst features of his experience as a leader writer and professor. On 15 March 1883, at St Jude's, Whitechapel, he married Catherine or Kate [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51372/', "Courtney, Catherine (1847&#150;1929)")</script>], daughter of Richard Potter, formerly chairman of the Great Western Railway, and his wife, Lawrencina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heyworth. The Courtneys made a formidable couple, prominent in radical circles, but with Leonard, especially, seen initially as something of a bore: his wife's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36799/', "Beatrice Webb")</script> thought &#145;he had no subtlety, no originality&#151;he thought in the grooves made by other minds and by minds of the plainer sort&#146;  (Hart, 124). There was some social prejudice against Courtney, and in 1883, when the speakership was vacant, Dilke thought that Courtney would be unsuitable because he dropped his aitches.<br>
<br>Courtney's career was not, however, to run in the grooves of Liberal executive politics, for in 1884 during the debates on the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span>, he made the inclusion in the bill of proportional representation&#151;which he had advocated since the 1870s&#151;a condition of his membership of the government, and had to resign. From the back benches Courtney and John Lubbock (1834&#150;1913) pressed the cause of proportional representation, especially with respect to school boards, local government, and home rule for Ireland, with no effect except for the aborted Irish county council measure of 1892 (introduced by A. J. Balfour). Courtney was elected for Bodmin in 1885. He opposed Gladstone's home rule proposals in 1886, but Gladstone rescued Courtney from political sterility by proposing him as chairman of committees and deputy speaker, which offices he held from 1886 until 1892. In them he was described as being &#145;impartially unfair to both sides&#146;. In 1892 the Liberals encouraged him to stand for the speakership, but he declined, as he feared it would muzzle him. He was sworn of the privy council on 29 January 1889.<br>
<br>Despite Courtney's unionism, he remained a passionate anti-imperialist. He especially opposed British expansion in Africa, and argued against the &#145;forward&#146; policy in Egypt, the Sudan, and South Africa. He opposed the annexation of the Transvaal in 1877, denounced the Jameson raid of 1896, and attacked the policy which led to the outbreak of the South African War in 1899. During that conflict he was chairman of the South African conciliation committee, which opposed demands for annexation of the Boer states and unconditional surrender. Courtney had always been an improbable Unionist, and this led to his final severance from that party. He did not stand for re-election in 1900. For the next six years Courtney &#145;lived the life of a political sage in Chelsea&#146;, as F. W. Hirst put it in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. His eyesight had already partially failed, but he turned to authorship, publishing <span class="italic">The Working Constitution of the United Kingdom</span> in 1901 and, anonymously, <span class="italic">The Diary of a Churchgoer</span> in 1904. However, he declined requests from the Electoral Reform Society to revive the cause of proportional representation until the Unionist government announced in February 1905 that there would be a redistribution of parliamentary seats. With the encouragement of Leonard and Kate Courtney, the Proportional Representation Society was revived and steadily campaigned throughout the years of Liberal government from 1905 to 1914.<br>
<br>Courtney stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal for West Edinburgh in 1906 and was given a peerage by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in July that year, when he became Baron Courtney of Penwith. He often spoke in the Lords, assisting the meagre Liberal group there, even on home rule. He became a strong critic of Sir Edward Grey's foreign policy and an advocate of armament reduction. He attacked the entente with France and advocated a similar, balancing, agreement with Germany. After 1914 he criticized what he saw as the failings of British diplomacy. During the war he defended freedom of speech and freedom of conscience, and in a speech on 8 November 1915 was the first parliamentarian to call for peace negotiations, a cause he advocated until his death, as the only means of ending the war. He worked with the Union of Democratic Control to pursue justice for conscientious objectors, and he gained the respect of many young radicals: C. R. Buxton recorded: &#145;I should have become quite outrageously cynical about old age, if it had not been for Lord Courtney&#146;  (Harvie, 241).<br>
<br>Courtney died at his home, 15 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, on 11 May 1918, and was buried four days later at Chelsea Old Church, London. His wife survived him by eleven years. The couple having no children, the barony became extinct. In Courtney's later years what had earlier seemed social inadequacies became strengths, and he and his wife played an important social as well as political role in giving vigour and tone to radical circles. His readiness to put principle before office gained him a place in the radical pantheon. F. W. Hirst, a friend and disciple, noted: &#145;To a mathematical mind and a strong logical sense, which insisted on arguing out every question, he united a very warm and emotional disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
