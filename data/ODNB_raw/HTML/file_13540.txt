<span class="headword">Holland,  Robert</span>  (1557&#150;1622?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born at Conwy, Caernarvonshire, the third son of Hew Gwyn Holland (<i>d</i>. 1584) and Jane, daughter of Hugh Conway of Bryneuryn. His father's family originated in Lancashire, but had been wealthy and influential in north Wales for centuries. Baptized at Conwy on 18 January 1557, Robert entered Clare College, Cambridge, at Easter 1577, graduated BA from Magdalene College in 1578, and proceeded MA from Jesus College in 1581. He was ordained deacon probably in early 1580 at Bangor and was ordained priest at Bangor on 15 January 1581, an application to be ordained at Ely the previous April having been rejected. In his paraphrase of the gospels he states that &#145;the race of his youth was unadvisedly run&#146;, but that after he had been &#145;four years or more tossed with sundry troubles&#146;, the hearts of his friends had been stirred up &#145;to favour his innocency, and to grant him breathing time after his travels&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Holie Historie</span>, dedication).<br>
<br>Holland served for a time as curate of Weston Colville, and in 1580 was a schoolmaster in Dullingham, both in Cambridgeshire. In 1591 he returned to Wales, settling in Pembrokeshire, where he was presented to the rectory of Prendergast, north of Haverfordwest, by Sir Christopher Hatton, lord chancellor. He founded a dynasty in the nearby parish of Walwyn's Castle: with his wife, Jane, daughter and heir of Robert Meylir of Haverfordwest, he had six sons, of whom Nicholas became rector of Marloes in Pembrokeshire. The senior branch of the family remained at Walwyn's Castle until almost the middle of the eighteenth century, when they settled in England. By 1600 he had also become rector of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire.<br>
<br>Holland's ministry had important consequences for the course of the later Reformation in Wales. He has been described as one of the most &#145;fluent and prolific&#146; of early Welsh protestant writers and is known to have written six books  (Williams, 392). He first went into print in English, publishing <span class="italic">The holie historie of our lord and saviour Jesus Christ's nativitie, life, actes &hellip; gathered into English meter and published to withdraw vaine wits from all unsaverie and wicked rimes and fables, to some love and liking of spirituall songs and holy scriptures</span> in 1594. But thereafter he turned his attention to presenting the protestant message in the Welsh language. <span class="italic">Dau Gymro yn taring yn bell o'u gwlad</span> (1600) is a notable discussion, in dialogue form, of the current state of popular religion in Wales particularly concerning witchcraft; it may have been modelled on the exercises in practical divinity, also in dialogue, recently published by English writers like George Gifford. Tudur is in no doubt that everyone still believes in magic and expatiates on the subject, while drawing a distinction between the white and black varieties. His opponent, Cronw, remains unmoved by his arguments, exhorting him to study the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and to attend sermons. Impressed, Tudur is nevertheless forced to point out that he has never heard a sermon in his parish church, that the clergy are negligent in expounding biblical texts, and that most laymen are too poor to be able to buy a bible for study at home. Holland's brother Henry was also a leading writer against witchcraft; their mother Jane had been accused of witchcraft during the case of Gwen ferch Elis in 1594.<br>
<br>About 1600 Holland published at Oxford <span class="italic">Darmerth, neu, Arlwy i weddi</span>, a preparation for prayer and guide to exaltation, designed to guide the unlearned towards the true service of God; this was followed shortly afterwards by <span class="italic">Sail crefydd Gristionogol</span>, a translation of William Perkins's influential English catechism. In 1603 Holland embarked on a Welsh translation, with the help of George Owen Harry, of James I's <span class="italic">Basilikon doron</span>. The project was probably completed but both known surviving published copies are incomplete. Several other translations by Holland were probably lost because of the prevalence of plague in London that year. On 5 May 1607 Holland was presented to the rectory of Walwyn's Castle, and in 1612 to that of nearby Robeston West, both like Prendergast in the gift of the lord chancellor. Nothing is known of his later career, but he seems to have lived until 1622, when successors were appointed to his livings. Several of his writings survive only in late seventeenth-century reissues by Stephen Hughes.<br>
