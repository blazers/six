<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cheshire,  Geoffrey Chevalier</span>  (1886&#150;1978), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 27 June 1886 at Hilderstone, Winnington, Hartford, Cheshire, the second son of Walter Christopher Cheshire, solicitor and registrar of Northwich county court, Cheshire, and his wife, Clara Hatt Cook. Educated at Denstone College and Merton College, Oxford (1905&#150;10), he obtained first-class honours in jurisprudence in 1908 and a second class in the BCL degree in 1910. From 1909 to 1911 he lectured at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. In 1911 he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn and returned to Merton as assistant lecturer in law. In 1912 he was elected to a fellowship at Exeter College, Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1914 Cheshire obtained a commission in the Cheshire regiment, but on transfer to the Royal Flying Corps in 1916 he was assigned to the kite&#150;balloon section, which involved him, for a few months, in sitting in a basket 1000 feet above the British lines and spotting German targets for the gunners. He was twice wounded. He married on 6 February 1915 (Burella) Primrose Eleanor (1889/90&#150;1962), the younger daughter of Colonel Thomas Adam Anderson Barstow, of the Seaforth Highlanders. They had two sons, Group Captain <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50944/', "(Geoffrey) Leonard Cheshire")</script> OM VC DSO DFC, founder of the Cheshire Homes, and Christopher, head of Shell in Spain; both sons also went to Merton College.<br>
<br>After the war Cheshire returned to his teaching at Exeter College, where from 1919 to 1933 he also acted as bursar. He was an outstanding teacher and scholar. As law tutor he regularly had about thirty pupils, for whom he covered the whole range of the law examinations. As a lecturer he always drew large audiences, speaking in a clear gentle voice and with lucidity and directness. During that period he produced, in 1925, <span class="italic">The Modern Law of Real Property</span>, in which he prepared readers for the coming into force of the seven statutes which greatly modified English property law. In the book he traced the shifting policies underlying the law and the techniques employed in achieving them, and enunciated the law in its new more perspicuous and rational form. The book enjoyed an immediate and lasting success. In 1927 he undertook, with four colleagues, the task of reorganizing, for a nineteenth edition, <span class="italic">Stephen's Commentaries on the Laws of England</span> (4 vols., 1928). His main personal contribution was an attempt to display the law of property as a single whole, instead of merely describing successively the separate laws of real and personal property. Unfortunately his synthesis, though it received a welcome from academic reviewers, was shipwrecked on the conservatism of the profession, and was abandoned in the next edition. More recent thinking suggests that he was right.<br>
<br>In 1922 Cheshire added to his other offices that of All Souls lecturer in private international law and, in 1935, two years after relinquishing that appointment for that of All Souls reader in English law, he brought out the results of his work under the title <span class="italic">Private International Law</span>. That part of English law was then the perfect antithesis to real property law, for it was still fluid and in course of development. Hence it offered the freest scope to the mere jurist; and Cheshire, like Saul among the prophets, entered a territory quite different from that to which he had been accustomed. This highly original book, thought by many to be his best work, was &#145;born a classic&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1944 Cheshire was elected Vinerian professor of English law, becoming thereby a fellow of All Souls College. In 1945, in collaboration with his former pupil C. H. S. Fifoot, he published <span class="italic">The Law of Contract</span> with a companion <span class="italic">Cases on the Law of Contract</span> (1946). <span class="italic">Cheshire and Fifoot</span> was the first entirely new book on the subject to appear for many years. In spite of the critical temper pervading it, it has held the field and remains a stand-by not only of teachers and students but of the bench and bar.<br>
<br>Cheshire retired prematurely from the chair in 1949, but continued for many years to lecture to bar students. He was also a member of several committees concerned with law reform. During the Second World War he served as a captain in the Home Guard, and he also served as a JP and presided over a juvenile court.<br>
<br>In retirement Cheshire became deeply involved in his son Leonard's scheme for the support of terminal patients and was mainly responsible for drawing up the memorandum of association and articles of the Cheshire Homes Foundation. In consequence, in 1950, he abandoned his Berkshire home and moved to Laundry Cottage in the grounds of the first Cheshire Home, in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Cheshire was tall, spare, and of athletic build. From the time when he represented Merton at football and tennis he played games actively and to the end he kept himself fit. He was very practical: he built his Berkshire house with the aid of an architect and a clerk of works but without a contractor. He was handy with machinery and drove his ageing car to an advanced age, in fact until the accident that caused his death. He was genial and had many friends of all ages. His dry wit made him excellent company, though he did not relish large groups or great occasions.<br>
<br>He was, beyond doubt, the most eminent English academic lawyer of his generation, excelling as a lecturer, college tutor, and systematic writer, while also commanding the respect of the higher judiciary. In his three major books he introduced a new stage in the development of important branches of English law by raising their literary treatment to a higher level and subjecting them to reasoned criticism. The books have been described as intermediate between treatises and manuals. They are not exhaustive: they do not deal with every judicial decision or legislative provision relevant to the subject. But they do not merely state rules and general principles: they also allow scope for historical explanation, criticism, and, above all, the discovery and development of logical strands of doctrine. These qualities have not only commended them to teachers and students but have led both bench and bar to look to them for help in basing argument on principle.<br>
<br>One of the secrets of Cheshire's success as a writer was that he did not find law easy. He wrestled with a problem in his own mind and then worked out the best way to convey the conclusion he had arrived at, subjecting it also to the reactions of his audiences and pupils. &#145;Cheshire&#146;, said Lord Edmund-Davies, &#145;contrived to be both clear and stylish, he transformed the <i>look</i> of a page, he lightened the drudgery of learning&#146;  (Exeter College, <span class="italic">Association Register</span>, 13). Moreover, in the many editions of his books, for which he retained responsibility to an advanced age, he was always ready to change his mind when convinced by the arguments of others. He was indeed the least opinionated of legal writers. His famous &#145;trinity of books&#146; retain a major influence in their respective fields; and it seems highly unlikely that Cheshire's feat of writing such major works on three completely different subjects will ever be repeated.<br>
<br>Cheshire was awarded a DCL at Oxford in 1927, and in 1945 he was elected FBA and an honorary bencher of Lincoln's Inn. He became an honorary fellow of both Merton and Exeter colleges, and he received the honorary degree of LLD from London, Manchester, and Jadavpur universities. He was a member of the Institute of International Law from 1950 to 1965. On 11 July 1963 he married Dame Mary Kathleen Lloyd (1902&#150;1972) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63325/', "Cheshire, Dame Mary Kathleen")</script>], who had been director of the Women's Royal Naval Service from 1950 to 1954. She was the daughter of Aloysius Joseph Lloyd, master draper, of Channonrock, Hayling Island. She died on 3 April 1972. Cheshire himself died of bronchopneumonia, asthma, and ischaemic heart disease, on 27 October 1978 in the Royal Portsmouth Hospital, ten days after a car accident.<br>
