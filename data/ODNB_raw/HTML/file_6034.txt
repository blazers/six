<span class="headword">Compton, Sir  Herbert Abingdon Draper</span>  (1776&#150;1846), <span class="occ">judge in India</span>, was the only son of Henry Compton (<i>d</i>. before 1804) of Hartpury, Gloucestershire. He was a relation of Sir Walter Abingdon Compton, fifth and last baronet (<i>d</i>. 1773), of Hartpury. About 1790 he arrived in India and in August 1791 he became an ensign in her majesty's 74th regiment, then stationed in the Madras presidency. He served with the 74th in the war of 1790&#150;92 against Tipu Sultan of Mysore and was promoted lieutenant on 17 October 1793, but in April 1796 he resigned from the army and articled himself in an attorney's office in Madras. On 16 October 1798 he married Mary Anne, the daughter of John (Jean) Carere (<i>d</i>. 1780), a Swiss protestant who had joined the Madras medical service in 1764 after defecting from the service of Muhammad Yusuf, governor of Madura.<br>
<br>In 1802 Compton was appointed junior counsel to the East India Company in Madras. He returned to Britain in 1805 and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1808, having meanwhile supported his family by writing for newspapers, principally <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>. Mary had given birth to a son, Herbert, in September 1803. She cannot have lived for many years after this, for in February 1810 another son, Charles Francis, was born to Compton by a wife whose given names were Maria Elizabeth.<br>
<br>In 1809 the court of directors licensed Compton to return to Madras as an advocate, and in 1811 he again became counsel for the company. In 1814 he was granted permission to move to Bengal, and on 15 June 1815 he was enrolled as an advocate of the supreme court of Calcutta. By then he was again a widower, and on 26 July 1815 he married Sarah Cherry, daughter of Edward Mullins of Calcutta. The artist George Chinnery was a witness to their union in St John's Church. They had at least four children, among them Thomas Abingdon Draper (1820&#150;1862), a future Bombay civilian and judge of Sholapur. In 1816 Compton was appointed standing counsel to the company in the Calcutta supreme court, and in 1820 he became sheriff of Calcutta. In 1822 he was appointed advocate general of Madras, a position which a former incumbent, Alexander Anstruther, had enthusiastically recommended him for a decade previously. In March 1828 he was readmitted to the Calcutta bar, and in 1831, after a brief retirement in Britain, he was appointed chief justice of Bombay and knighted. He finally retired from India in 1839. Throughout his career, government and private clients alike praised his ability, common sense, local knowledge, and integrity. He was the recipient on several occasions of gifts of plate from grateful clients, including a handsome silver service presented by the leading Indian inhabitants of Bombay on his departure in 1839.<br>
<br>Compton died at his house in Hyde Park Gardens, London, on 15 January 1846. He was remembered in Indian legal circles as a self-made man who had worked his way up by exceptional talent. After his death his daughter Mrs Skirrow gave a portrait of him by Ramsay Reinagle to the Oriental Club in Hanover Square. In the words of the club's historian, it shows &#145;a handsome man, with good nose and forehead&#146;, his whiskers &#145;very small&#146;, and his hair &#145;thick and grey&#146;  (Baillie, 221).<br>
