<span class="headword">Mann,  Julia de Lacy</span>  (1891&#150;1985), <span class="occ">economic historian and college head</span>, was born on 22 August 1891 in London, the daughter of James Saumarez Mann (<i>b</i>. 1851), editor and former fellow and tutor of Trinity College, Oxford, and his wife, Amy Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowman. She grew up in Bromley, in a home characterized by &#145;liberal politics and a strong evangelical atmosphere&#146;  (Major, 1), and received a strong grounding in classics at Bromley high school which prepared her to read <i>literae humaniores</i> at Somerville College, Oxford (1910&#150;14). Little is known of her childhood or years at Oxford, where a contemporary described her as a tall and imposing young woman, who &#145;was a fine Hercules&#146; in the first-year play  (ibid., 2). Apparently, she developed an interest in social work through her mother, leading her to spend the year 1914&#150;15 living in the Women's University Settlement in Southwark, while reading for the social science certificate at the London School of Economics. At the LSE, however, Mann discovered the emerging field of economic history:<blockquote>At the beginning of the First World War, I thought I would do social work, and so I went to the L.S.E. and did the Diploma in Social Science, and that's where I met economic history for the first time, and I thought this is the stuff for me &hellip; I didn't want to teach and teaching and social work were about the only professions you could have in those days if you were a woman. (Berg, 314)</blockquote>Mann's pursuit of economic history was delayed by the First World War. From 1915 to 1916 she served as a clerk in the Admiralty, and from 1916 to 1919 in the Foreign Office, attending the Paris peace conference as one of the staff.<br>
<br>In 1919 Mann returned to Somerville College, Oxford to do the diploma in economics. Through one of her tutors, J. A. Todd, who was secretary of the empire cotton-growing committee of the Board of Trade during the war, Mann became interested in the cotton industry. After serving for a short time as Todd's secretary, in 1922 Mann returned to the LSE to work for a PhD on the development of the cotton industry prior to the industrial revolution, supervised by Lilian Knowles. The following year Mann left the LSE upon her appointment as vice-principal and tutor in economics at what was then known as St Hilda's Hall, Oxford.<br>
<br>At that time, St Hilda's was the smallest of the Oxford women's colleges: Mann was one of five resident tutors in 1924. Probably because of her habitual shyness, &#145;as a tutor, Mann was not a great success and old students remember long silences during tutorials&#146;  (Rayner, 62). In fact, Mann kept in contact with many of her students long after they left St Hilda's. She proved herself, however, an able administrator when she found herself virtually running the college during the illness of the principal, Winifred Moberly. Julia Mann was elected principal of St Hilda's after Moberly's death in 1928.<br>
<br>Mann served as principal of St Hilda's during the difficult years of the depression, the Second World War, and the post-war period. At her retirement in 1955 she left the college in a strengthened position&#151;free of debt and ready to embark on a major period of expansion in which it would be accepted as a full college of the university. As principal of St Hilda's, Mann needed to balance the college's lack of endowment with the need to expand numbers and to provide more scholarships and research funding. Although the college was limited to 150 members by the university in 1927 (raised to 180 after the Second World War), in practice it could not even expand to this level because of the cost of building additional accommodation for students. Even though Mann disliked appealing for money, she carried through the raising of funds for the building of a new library wing in 1935. Under Mann's leadership after the war, the college launched a major fund-raising and building campaign, the first fruit of which, the Sacher Wing, was opened in 1954. During the early 1950s the college also prepared for self-government, leading to the granting of a new charter in 1955.<br>
<br>Possessing little ambition for herself, Julia de Lacy Mann was dedicated to St Hilda's College. During her tenure as principal she performed many routine administrative functions single-handedly, while never accepting her full salary and living in two rooms in the college. After the death of her uncle, a former warden of Merton College, she became a benefactor of St Hilda's. Although Mann's responsibilities at St Hilda's gave her little time to participate in the university, as senior principal of the women's colleges she was a well-respected figure in Oxford, serving on the council of Barnett House, which provided training in the social sciences, and on the appointments board.<br>
<br>Julia Mann's contributions to women's education were matched by her contributions to economic history. During her early years at St Hilda's she continued her research on the cotton industry, publishing <span class="italic">The Cotton Trade and Industrial Lancashire, 1600&#150;1780</span> with A. P. Wadsworth in 1931. &#145;Tentative and pathbreaking in the 1930s, it is a book that has remained authoritative and fertile&#146;  (Harte and Ponting, xi). During this period, Mann was also active in the Economic History Society, which had been founded in 1926, serving on its council and as assistant editor of its journal, <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span>, under joint editors R. H. Tawney and Ephraim Lipson, with whom she had studied at Oxford. As principal of St Hilda's, however, Mann limited her research in the subject to publishing bibliographies in <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span>, supervising post-graduate students, and reviewing books.<br>
<br>Julia Mann's career entered a new phase after her retirement in 1955, when she moved to the town of Melksham in Wiltshire. Mann began to undertake research on the textile history of the region, publishing chapters in the Victoria county history of Wiltshire (1959) and <span class="italic">Studies in the Industrial Revolution Presented to T. S. Ashton</span> (1960) and editing <span class="italic">Documents Illustrative of the Wiltshire Textile Trades in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1964). She also published a chapter in <span class="italic">A History of Technology</span> (1958) and articles in <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span> and the new journal <span class="italic">Textile History</span>, founded in 1968. Her research culminated in the publication of <span class="italic">The Cloth Industry in the West of England from 1640 to 1880</span> (1971). Like her earlier study of the cotton trade, this work was noted for its exhaustive research, attention to detail, and clear prose. Mann uncovered many new sources, gaining access to the records of textile firms held in private hands. During her retirement, Mann also gave support and encouragement to a new generation of economic historians, shown by the publication of the festschrift <span class="italic">Textile History and Economic History: Essays in Honour of Miss Julia de Lacy Mann</span>, edited by N. B. Harte and K. G. Ponting (1973).<br>
<br>Mann was active in her Wiltshire community, serving on the county education committee and the county records committee, and acting as president of the West Wiltshire Historical Society and chair of the Melksham Local History Group. She frequently attended concerts in Bath and enjoyed reading, particularly nineteenth-century memoirs. In the last years of her life she developed a new interest, transcribing the letters of her father's Guernsey ancestors. At her home at Melksham, which she shared at first with three other women, one of whom was her Somerville contemporary Frances Griffiths, she welcomed many friends. Although she did not have close relatives of her own, she took a particular interest in the daughters and grandchildren of a friend. In her last months she was cared for by her devoted housekeeper. Julia de Lacy Mann died at The Cottage, 462 Bowerhill, Melksham, on 23 May 1985 at the age of ninety-three.<br>
