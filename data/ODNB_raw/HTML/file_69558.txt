<span class="headword">Weaver,  Gertrude  Baillie-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gertrude Renton; <em>pseud. </em>Gertrude Colmore]</span>  (1855&#150;1926), <span class="occ">writer and feminist</span>, was born on 8 June 1855 at 5 Upper Lansdowne Terrace, Kensington, the sixth daughter of John Thomson Renton, stockbroker, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leishman. Having been privately educated in Germany, Paris, and London she married, on 18 July 1882, Henry Arthur Colmore Dunn, barrister; he died in the 1890s and on 2 January 1901 Gertrude married another barrister, <a name="cosubject_69558"></a><span class="headword">Harold  Baillie-Weaver</span>  (1860&#150;1926)<span class="occ"></span>, who was the son of Henry Edward Weaver, superintendent of the Telegraph Company, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alcock. He was a supporter of feminism and, like his wife, a humanitarian, theosophist, and campaigner for animals.<br>
<br>Having adopted the name Gertrude Colmore, Gertrude's reputation as a writer has rested upon two suffrage works reissued in the 1980s. Her novel <span class="italic">Suffragette Sally</span> (1911) was reissued in 1984 under the title <span class="italic">The Suffragettes: a Story of Three Women</span> and her hagiographic account <span class="italic">The Life of Emily Davison</span>, originally written as an extended obituary after Emily Wilding Davison died in 1913, attempting to gain publicity for the suffrage cause by grabbing the reins of the king's horse at the Derby, was reissued in 1988 as <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Emily Wilding Davison</span>. However, Gertrude's output was much broader, including poetry, short stories, pamphlets, and a number of melodramatic novels dealing with social, political, and animal questions. Her early novels had covered social themes from a feminist perspective; <span class="italic">Conspiracy of Silence</span>, for example, tackles the hypocritical hiding of hereditary madness.<br>
<br>Gertrude's use of melodramatic narratives and devices is most strikingly found in three of her novels that deal directly with the suffering of animals: <span class="italic">The Angel and the Outcast</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Priests of Progress</span> (1908), and <span class="italic">A Brother of the Shadow</span> (1926). These are melodramatic narratives based on contests of moral authority. In <span class="italic">The Angel and the Outcast</span> Gertrude explores the nature/nurture debate in the context of the morally contaminating Deptford slaughterhouses. So forceful was her anti-vivisection message in <span class="italic">Priests of Progress</span> (1908) that it was condemned by physiologists, who discussed how to mount a &#145;counter-attack&#146;  (Research Defence Society, minutes, 8 Feb 1908, Wellcome L., SA/RDS C1). Her last book, <span class="italic">A Brother of the Shadow</span> (1926), developed such themes. The villain, a professor of physiology, exercises power over men, women, and animals, using hypnotic and devilish powers to coerce them to self-destruction. Gertrude's suffrage and animal campaigning fiction drew on her contemporary political activity and the humanitarian milieu in which she lived. From 1910 she sat on the management committee of the pioneering Battersea Hospital, an anti-vivisection establishment for the local poor, which forbade experiments on animals and patients alike.<br>
<br>Following Gertrude's marriage to Baillie-Weaver, a member of the Humanitarian League that was founded in 1891 by Henry Salt and campaigned for human and animal rights, they worked together on political, social, and animal questions. Baillie-Weaver was also a member of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage; he spoke regularly on their behalf and participated in the men's league contingent in the suffrage procession in June 1910. Gertrude supported the militant suffrage organization the Women's Freedom League, which published a collection of her campaigning suffrage stories entitled <span class="italic">Mr Jones and the Governess</span> [1913]. In 1914 she probably joined the United Suffragists, a new suffrage society for men and women that campaigned throughout the war on women's suffrage.<br>
<br>Harold and Gertrude shared common interests in the welfare of animals and in theosophy, which attracted many with progressive views. They joined the fashionable central London branch of the Theosophical Society in 1906. Harold was general secretary of the society in England from 1916 to 1921; he was active in their anti-vivisection group, the Starry Cross, and, as chairman of the European Theosophical Federation, was described by theosophist colleagues as &#145;a tower of calm and peaceful strength&#146;  (<span class="italic">International Theosophical Year Book</span>, 187).<br>
<br>Gertrude wrote pamphlets for the Theosophical Society on progressive ideals in education and against cruelty to animals. Harold also took a keen interest in educational matters, chairing the Theosophical Educational Trust, which ran the theosophist school St Christopher's, in Letchworth. Subsequently he was active in the New Education Fellowship, an international organization of educators interested in the new ideals of progressive education, and he chaired and organized European conferences in Calais and Montreux in the 1920s. Gertrude and Harold's empathy with, and practical help for, animals was exemplified by their membership of the National Canine Defence League. Harold chaired the 1910 annual general meeting and, to loud and prolonged cheers, he supported the sentiments of the guest speaker, Women's Freedom League president Charlotte Despard, declaring &#145;the sooner you get women's suffrage, the sooner will you succeed in emancipating dogs from cruelty&#146;  (National Canine Defence League, <span class="italic">Annual Report</span>, 1910, 27). With Ernest Bell of the Humanitarian League he wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Horses in Warfare</span> (1912), exposing the plight of horses in the South African War and calling for the extension of the Geneva convention to include them.<br>
<br>After their marriage Gertrude and Harold moved to Newport, near Saffron Walden, Essex, where Gertrude was local secretary both of the National Canine Defence League branch and of the animal welfare group Our Dumb Friends' League (later Blue Cross). As supporters of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society they also campaigned for the humane slaughter of animals. In the 1920s they moved to Wimbledon, Surrey, with the intention of acting as guardians to Krishnamurti, hailed by the theosophists as a new messiah. After a long struggle with stomach cancer Harold died at their Wimbledon home, Eastward Ho, North View, The Common, on 18 March 1926. Gertrude survived him by only eight months, dying of heart failure at 6 Hunter Road, Wimbledon, on 26 November. She was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
<br>The Baillie-Weavers were typical of many humanitarians of their time&#151;active in a range of progressive political causes underpinned by theosophical principles affecting both animals and people. Hartwell's statue <span class="italic">Protecting the Defenceless</span>, dedicated to them for their pioneering work in founding the National Council for Animals' Welfare Work, stands in the St John's Lodge public gardens of Regent's Park in London as a reminder of their important activity.<br>
