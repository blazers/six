<span class="headword">Moorhead,  Ethel Agnes Mary</span>  (1869&#150;1955), <span class="occ">suffragette and painter</span>, was born on 28 August 1869 at Fisher Street, Maidstone, Kent, one of six children of George Alexander Moorhead (<i>d</i>. 1911/12), an army surgeon of Irish extraction, and his wife, Margaret Humphries (1833&#150;1902), an Irishwoman of French Huguenot extraction. She spent a peripatetic childhood in India, Mauritius, and South Africa, before the family returned to Scotland towards the end of the nineteenth century. Ethel Moorhead's elder sister, Alice, encouraged by their father, qualified as a doctor in 1893 and practised in Dundee. She married a doctor in Leith in 1908 and died a year later. According to Ethel Moorhead's memoir, &#145;Incendiaries&#146;, while her siblings spread their wings in different parts of the globe, Ethel was the stay-at-home daughter who looked after their parents (her mother died in 1902). One of her brothers, Arthur, died in Batheaston, Somerset, in 1916 and left the residue of his estate to her, thus providing her with an income. Another brother, Rupert (<i>d</i>. 1939), worked as a doctor, also in Batheaston.<br>
<br>Although her main role was perceived as one of caring for her parents, Ethel was permitted to study painting in Paris during the 1890s, financially supported by her sister Alice. Although it was never considered that she would become a professional artist, she apparently studied painting under Whistler and drawing under Mucha. The first paintings she exhibited at Dundee Graphic Arts Society (in 1901) were said to be &#145;the gems of the collection&#146;, &#145;notable for their dark tones and strength of colour&#146;  (Henderson). She had a studio in Dundee and exhibited widely, acclaimed as &#145;a most refined and distinguished artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Celtic Annual</span>, 16). During that period she kept house for her father, who encouraged her painting and to whom she was very close.<br>
<br>Ethel became involved in the women's suffrage movement in 1910, joining the militant, Pankhurst-led Women's Social and Political Union. In December she threw an egg at Winston Churchill at a political meeting in Dundee. In January 1911 she became Dundee's first tax resister (on the principle adopted by many in the suffrage movement that if they were not admitted to full citizenship women should not be held liable for taxes). The bailiffs came to the house to remove all the household goods but were persuaded to take a silver candelabrum. Her friends bought it back, and her father &#145;was delighted when she marched in with it&#146;  (Moorhead, 251). After her father's death &#145;the loneliness was terrible&#146;  (ibid.) and she moved to Edinburgh and threw herself into the women's suffrage campaign. In March 1912 she was arrested in London for damaging two windows but was discharged for lack of evidence. In September she smashed the glass at the Wallace monument; when she was arrested she gave her name as Edith Johnston and served a seven-day prison sentence in Perth. In October, after being ejected from a meeting in Edinburgh's Synod Hall, she marched into the classroom of the male teacher who had been responsible and attacked him with a dog whip. In December she was arrested in Aberdeen for causing a disturbance and gave her name as Mary Humphreys; she went on hunger strike but was released on paying part of her fine after four days. At the end of January 1913 she threw cayenne pepper into the eyes of a police constable in Leven and was arrested under the name of Margaret Morrison. She caused havoc in Cupar police cells and was then sentenced to thirty days' imprisonment in Perth, but was released after serving only two days because she had been hunger striking since her arrest.<br>
<br>By this time Ethel Moorhead was being referred to as the &#145;leader&#146; of the suffragettes in Scotland. She was never that but she was certainly very well known, not only for her many and varied activities but also because of her flamboyant defiance of authority. In July 1913, as Margaret Morrison, she was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for attempted fire-raising but was released under the so-called <span class="roman">Cat and Mouse Act</span> after a five-day hunger strike. In 1914 she was re-arrested and became the first suffragette in Scotland to be forcibly fed (in Calton gaol, Edinburgh); she was released after contracting pneumonia. She escaped from the house of the doctor caring for her and was not recaptured before the war, though it seems certain that she was Fanny Parker's accomplice in attempting to burn down Robert Burns's cottage in July 1914.<br>
<br>Militancy was renounced by the Pankhursts after war broke out and, in common with many other suffragettes, Ethel was active in relief work during the early stages of the war, working with Fanny Parker for the National Service Organization, initiated by the other militant suffrage society, the Women's Freedom League.<br>
<br>After the war Ethel sold her house in Dundee to another artist and spent some time drifting, before settling in France in the 1920s where she launched and co-edited a literary journal, <span class="italic">This Quarter</span>, with a young Irish-American poet, Ernest Walsh. In <span class="italic">This Quarter</span>, no. 3, 1927, she recorded that the journal had been founded &#145;on the strength of a legacy left me by a friend, Frances Mary Parker&#146;. Contributors to <span class="italic">This Quarter</span> included Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and James Joyce. Ethel at that time was later described by American novelist Kay Boyle as having<blockquote>short bobbed hair, with only a little grey in it, and the pince-nez she wore gave her an air of authority; but there was at the same time something like shyness, or wariness in her small uneasy brown eyes and her tense mouth. (McAlmon, 194)</blockquote>Ethel had a love-hate relationship with Kay Boyle, who, bursting on the scene, had a passionate affair with her co-editor (and possibly lover), and bore his child. Walsh died of tuberculosis in October 1926. In 1934 Ethel edited his works for an American publisher.<br>
<br>Ethel Moorhead died on 4 March 1955 at 14 Booterstown Road, Blackrock, co. Dublin, and was buried at Dean's Grange cemetery, Dublin.<br>
