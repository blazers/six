<span class="headword">Walker,  William</span>  (1791&#150;1867), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 1 August 1791 at Markton, Musselburgh, Midlothian, the son of Alexander Walker and his wife, Margaret Somerville, of Lauder. His father manufactured salt from sea water until this business became unprofitable; the family then moved to Edinburgh, where Walker was apprenticed to the engraver E. Mitchell. In 1815 Walker moved to London and studied line engraving with James Stewart, stipple engraving with Thomas Woolnoth, and mezzotinting with Thomas Lupton. In 1819 he returned to Scotland and was employed to make the engraving of Sir Henry Raeburn's equestrian portrait of the fourth earl of Hopetoun (1821), which established his reputation; he also engraved a number of portraits after Raeburn, notably those of Sir Walter Scott and Raeburn himself (both 1826), which are often cited as among the finest examples of stipple work ever produced. In 1828 he published an engraving of Lord Brougham, after a painting by Sir Thomas Lawrence, which he himself had commissioned.<br>
<br>In 1829 Walker married  <a href="#cosubject_28476">Elizabeth Reynolds [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the daughter of the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23438/', "Samuel William Reynolds")</script>, and settled in London at 64 Margaret Street, where he lived for the rest of his life. They had six children: William, Samuel Alexander, Elizabeth, Marion, Kate, and Jane. Walker's total <i>&#339;uvre</i> included 107 plates (twenty-three stipple, eighty-one mezzotint, and three in mixed method), of which 100 are portraits of contemporary figures which he published himself. He also produced historical group pictures. He collaborated with other engravers, among them his brother-in-law, Samuel William Reynolds the younger, and a pupil of his father-in-law, the mezzotinter Samuel Cousins. It was Cousins who did the mezzotinting on Walker's portrait <span class="italic">Robert Burns</span>, after Alexander Nasmyth (1830), which Nasmyth is said to have considered a better likeness than his own picture. Walker's most important historical pictures are <span class="italic">The Reform Bill Receiving the Royal Assent in 1832</span>, after S. W. Reynolds, engraved with Reynolds (1836); <span class="italic">The Reformers Presenting their Protest at the Diet of Spires</span>, after G. Cattermole (1844, larger version 1845); <span class="italic">The Aberdeen Cabinet Deciding upon the Expedition to the Crimea</span>, after John Gilbert (1857); and <span class="italic">The Distinguished Men of Science</span>, engraved with assistance from G. Zobel, after a drawing by John Gilbert, J. L. Skill, and Walker himself (1862). This last work includes fifty-one portraits and occupied Walker for six years. Late in life Walker set up a commercial portrait photography business. He died at his house in Margaret Street on 7 September 1867 and was buried in Brompton cemetery. Examples of his prints are in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery, London.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28476"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Walker</span>  (1800&#150;1876), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, wife of William Walker, was born in London, the second daughter of the engraver Samuel William Reynolds (1773&#150;1835) and his wife, Jane Cowen. Her father taught her to paint and to engrave in mezzotint at an early age; she later studied engraving with Thomas Lupton and miniature painting with George Clint and William Northcote, and herself became a popular miniaturist. She was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists between 1818 and 1850, and in 1830 she was appointed miniature painter to William IV. Among her many eminent sitters were five prime ministers. She also painted in oils, and after her marriage she assisted her husband with his engravings. She died at 64 Margaret Street on 9 November 1876 and was buried with her husband. Her miniature of her father is in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and her full-size portrait of the earl of Devon is at Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
