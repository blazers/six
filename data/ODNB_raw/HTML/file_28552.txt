<span class="headword">Wales,  John  of</span> <span class="st"> [John Wallensis]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1285), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian</span>, was born in north Wales and graduated in theology from Oxford, before joining the Franciscans in 1258. He belonged to the custody of Worcester, which included north Wales. He was sixth lector to the Oxford Franciscans, from 1259 to 1262, and it can be deduced from his works that he spent the early to mid-1260s living and writing in Oxford, before transferring to Paris in the late 1260s. He was certainly in Paris by June 1270, as a sermon of this date survives. There are no references to John's activities during the 1270s, but his abundant works show that he spent most of his time writing, while his sources indicate that he did this in Paris. During the years 1281&#150;3, John was one of two Franciscan regent masters of theology in Paris, and three of the sermons he preached there have survived. In this period John left Paris for long enough to travel to Wales twice as Archbishop Pecham's ambassador to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd&#151;he made trips in October and November of 1282. From 1283 to 1285 he was still based in Paris, as part of the commission appointed to examine the works of Peter John Olivi, a Proven&ccedil;al friar suspected of heresy. John died in 1285, before the commission had completed its task, and was buried in Paris.<br>
<br>John of Wales was a remarkably prolific writer. Some twenty surviving works are now accepted as his. They range from sermons and biblical commentaries to pastoral handbooks of various kinds. The body of work as a whole was extremely popular from the late thirteenth until the mid-sixteenth century. Over 450 manuscripts of John's works survive, and fourteen early printed editions of various texts appeared between 1472 and 1550.<br>
<br>The pastoral handbooks were by far the most popular of John's works. They are remarkable particularly for the wide variety of texts that John quoted to help educate his readers. His fascination with the ancient world led him to seek out an extraordinary range of sources, some extremely rarely cited in his time. His use of more than fifty classical authors establishes him as a major classicizing writer for the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and he seems to have been an important link between the classical interests of Robert Grosseteste (<i>d</i>. 1253) and the wider classicizing tendencies of many fourteenth-century English friars. In particular, John was one of the first medieval writers to quote from a full text of the <span class="italic">Noctes Atticae</span> of Aulus Gellius, doing much to spread and popularize knowledge of this author.<br>
<br>The four best known of John's works were his <span class="italic">Breviloquium de virtutibus antiquorum principum et philosophorum</span> (151 manuscripts survive, and 5 early printed editions), <span class="italic">Communiloquium, sive, Summa collationum</span> (144 manuscripts survive, and 10 printed editions), <span class="italic">Compendiloquium de vita illustrium philosophorum</span> (27 manuscripts survive, and 3 early printed editions), and <span class="italic">Breviloquium de sapientia sanctorum</span> (23 manuscripts and 5 early printed editions). These four works have many stylistic similarities and seem to have been written as a group between the mid-1260s and the early 1270s, the first two predating 1270&#150;72, and the latter two postdating this.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Breviloquium de virtutibus</span> relates to the group of works on virtue produced in the later thirteenth century, and to the <i>F&uuml;rstenspiegel</i> or volumes of advice to princes. John was unusual in his inclusion of philosophers, a theme popular at the time but usually treated separately. This, with the inclusion of many lively classical tales, does much to explain the work's success and popularity. Apart from the many manuscripts and early printed editions, this work spawned at least ten separate translations and abridgements in five different languages.<br>
<br>John's greatest work, in size as in popularity, was his <span class="italic">Communiloquium</span>. Written between <i>c</i>.1265 and 1269&#150;72, it is a vast handbook for preachers, crammed with extracts from a wide variety of sources. It deals primarily with the state and its ruler, with shorter sections on various divisions of society. John had a clear concept of the state (<i>respublica</i>) as a separate entity, and reveals distinct ideas about the need of every individual to support the state and to obey its laws&#151;rulers included. John says that if a king does not rule properly, he is no longer a king but rather a tyrant, and that it is no crime to kill a tyrant. The dating of <span class="italic">Communiloquium</span> to the mid- to late 1260s, a time of conflict and civil war in Italy, Germany, and England, made these comments highly topical. The later parts of <span class="italic">Communiloquium</span> comment at length upon contemporary society: husbands and wives, children and education, masters and servants, merchants and farmers, churchmen of all kinds. The work was extraordinarily popular, and its vast compass and selection of exciting tales must partly explain this, but the evidence of textual use indicates that for the readers, as for the writer, the political content was the real meat of the volume.<br>
<br>John's more conventional works were rather less popular. Even so, the <span class="italic">Legiloquium</span>, <span class="italic">Moniloquium</span>, <span class="italic">Summa iustitiae</span>, <span class="italic">De poenitentia</span>, <span class="italic">Ars praedicandi</span>, and <span class="italic">Ordinarium vitae religiosae</span> each survives in between sixteen and forty-four manuscripts&#151;still substantial numbers for handbooks of this period. John's <span class="italic">Postilla in Apocalypsim</span> was also popular (thirty-seven manuscripts), more so than his various series of sermons. John of Wales's posthumous influence was immense. His works were quoted from Oxford sermons of the 1290s to an English political tract of the 1430s, while Chaucer made considerable use of <span class="italic">Communiloquium</span> in his <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>, notably in the general prologue and in the tales of the wife of Bath, the summoner, and the pardoner. John's writings were owned and used in every country in medieval Europe, and were translated into the vernaculars of England, France, Spain, and Italy.<br>
