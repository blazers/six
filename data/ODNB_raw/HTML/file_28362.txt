<span class="headword">Vyvyan, Sir  Richard Rawlinson</span>, eighth baronet  (1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">politician and philosopher</span>, was born on 6 June 1800 at the family home at Trelowarren, in the parish of Mawgan in Meneage, Cornwall, the eldest of seven children of Sir Vyell Vyvyan, seventh baronet (<i>bap</i>. 1767, <i>d</i>. 1820), and his wife, Mary Hutton (1777&#150;1812), only daughter of Thomas Hutton Rawlinson of Lancaster. Vyvyan was educated at Harrow School from 1813 to 1816 or 1817 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 22 May 1818 but he did not proceed to a degree. Upon his father's death on 27 January 1820 he succeeded to the title and estates of Trelowarren and in September that year became lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Cornwall yeomanry cavalry.<br>
<br>Vyvyan's political career commenced in 1825 when, at a by-election on 27 January, he was returned to parliament for the county of Cornwall; he was re-elected in 1826 and 1830. &#145;Although unswerving in his attachment to the principles of toryism, he was far from being a subservient supporter of his party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 212). He disapproved of the concession of Roman Catholic emancipation, and early in 1830 announced his intention of weakening the Wellington administration as much as possible. In that year he was a member of the select committee on the East India Company's charter. In the previous October he had explained his views to Palmerston, and invited him to lead the House of Commons in a tory administration without the duke of Wellington, but with the inclusion of a few young Liberals. He voted for Sir Henry Parnell's motion for referring the civil list to a select committee, which caused the resignation of the Wellington ministry, but he and the other high tories would not support the new whig ministry. Although Vyvyan recognized the need for change in the electoral system he strongly opposed the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. On its second reading on 21 March 1831 he was put forward by the tories as their spokesman to move that it should be postponed for six months. When the boom of cannon announced the approach of William IV to dissolve parliament on 22 April 1831 Vyvyan was engaged in moving the rejection of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> so vehemently that it was only &#145;by pulling him down by the skirts of his coat&#146; that he was compelled to take a seat  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 212). He was then at the height of his fame and had a well-earned reputation for eloquence.<br>
<br>A severe contest for the representation of the county of Cornwall ensued. However, after the poll had been open for five days Vyvyan and his tory colleague Lord Valletort lost to their whig opponents, Mr Pendarves and Sir Charles Lemon  (Courtney, 408&#150;10). Vyvyan became MP for Okehampton in Devon on 14 July 1831. At this time he purchased the ruins of its old castle as he was the rightful heir to the ancient but dormant barony of Courtenay of Okehampton. However, Vyvyan never attempted to revive the title in his favour. At the general elections in December 1832 and February 1835 he was returned, after expensive victories, for the city of Bristol, but he did not seek re-election in 1837. After the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> his interest in politics seems to have declined, and he spoke little, though he strenuously opposed the third reading of the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Bill</span>. From 1837 to 1841 he was without a seat, and in 1840 became high sheriff for Cornwall. At the general election on 1 July 1841 he was returned for Helston, a few miles from Trelowarren, and he continued to sit for it until 1857. A protectionist, opposing free trade doctrines and the introduction of income tax, he addressed, in June 1842, a letter on the subject to his constituents pointing out the pitfalls of the commercial and financial policy of Sir Robert Peel's administration. Macaulay, in July 1843, wrote of the tory party as split into three or more factions, one being represented by Vyvyan and the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. Vyvyan continued to oppose reform and voted against Peel on the repeal of the corn laws and against Disraeli's budget of 1852.<br>
<br>Vyvyan was a philosopher and a metaphysician. His scientific writings commenced in 1825 when he printed for private circulation <span class="italic">An Essay on Arithmo-Physiology</span>, which purported to be &#145;A Chronological Classification of Organised Matter&#146;. In 1826 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Vyvyan was engaged for many years with Dr Charles T. Pearce of Durleston Park, Swanage, in scientific experiments and research on light, heat, and magnetism. He purchased a section of the library of M. Libri which formed a part of his &#145;most choice library&#146;  (H. N. Pym, ed., <span class="italic">Memories of Old Friends: Journals and Letters of Caroline Fox</span>, 1882, 1.26). Vyvyan also published several letters and speeches. His letter to the magistrates of Berkshire on their practice of consigning prisoners to solitary confinement before trial, and ordering them to be disguised by masks, passed into a second edition in 1845. His account of the &#145;fogou&#146;, or cave, at Halligey, Trelowarren, is in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institute of Cornwall</span> (1885), 8.256&#150;8. Unpublished writings include night journals in Italian kept by Vyvyan from 1841 to 1846 and the outline of a Maratha novel about the fortunes of an attendant in a foreign country.<br>
<br>As a metaphysicist he published a volume entitled <span class="italic">Psychology, or, A Review of the Arguments in Proof of the Existence and Immortality of the Animal Soul</span>, but it was recalled immediately after publication. Two volumes on metaphysical subjects, entitled the &#145;Harmony of the universe&#146; (1842) and &#145;Harmony of the comprehensible world&#146; (1845), were written but never published. Nevertheless, perhaps by private drafts and discussion, his views and activity were sufficient to make him a suspect as author of <span class="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> (1845).<br>
<br>After 1857 Vyvyan lived in complete retirement until his death at Trelowarren on 15 August 1879. He was buried in the family vault in the north-west corner of Mawgan in Meneage church on 21 August. In the event of his death not taking place at Trelowarren, Vyvyan had made provision in his will to be buried at Kensal Green cemetery close to his friends Mr Broderip and Robert Browne; the will also ensured that his domestic servants and paid agents would receive one year's salary after his death. Vyvyan never married and was succeeded by a nephew, the Revd Vyell Donnithorne Vyvyan, the son of his brother Vyell Francis Vyvyan.<br>
