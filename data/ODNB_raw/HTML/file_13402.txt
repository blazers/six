<span class="headword">Hobhouse, Sir  Benjamin</span>, first baronet  (1757&#150;1831), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Bristol on 29 March 1757, the second son of John Hobhouse (1712&#150;1787), a Bristol merchant, of The College, Westbury-on-Trym, Gloucestershire, and his first wife, Mary Smith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Medley (<i>d</i>. 1759), of Hereford. He was educated at Bristol grammar school where the local MP, Edmund Burke, presented him with a copy of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> following his delivery of an oration. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1774, graduating BA in 1778 and MA in 1781, and in 1776 entered the Middle Temple, from where he was called to the bar in 1781. He practised on the western circuit until 1783, when he travelled to France and Italy for his health; he later published <span class="italic">Remarks</span> on his travels (1796). After his return he married on 12 September 1785 Charlotte (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1791), daughter of Samuel Cam of Bradford, Wiltshire, clothier and partner in a Bath bank; they had three sons and two daughters. He married second on 18 April 1793 Amelia (1767&#150;1846), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21427/', "Dr Joshua Parry (1719&#150;1776)")</script>, Presbyterian minister of Cirencester, and Sarah Hillier; they had four sons and ten daughters. Both marriages drew the Anglican Hobhouse into dissenting circles. He became interested in unitarianism, wrote several pamphlets, notably against the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span>, but also on heresy, dogma, unrest, and intentional regicide, and described his creed as humanitarianism.<br>
<br>Politics also attracted Hobhouse. In 1780 he had canvassed for the ministerial candidates at Bristol, following his father's politics. By 1792, however, his sympathies were whig and reformist, on which platform, also championing peace, he was defeated at Bristol in 1796. On 20 February 1797 he entered parliament for Bletchingley, his seat purchased from Sir Robert Clayton for &pound;4000. In his first session he persistently criticized the bank stoppage of cash payments, and went on to oppose Pitt's administration on most major questions, displaying ethical concerns in advocating abolition of the slave trade and religious toleration. He joined the Whig Club on 5 June 1798. In 1800 he invested &pound;33,000 in Whitbread's brewery. When his college friend Addington succeeded Pitt in 1801 he remained in opposition, but was gradually won over, especially when peace was negotiated. As a committee chairman he was soon neutralized. In 1802 he declined candidature for Bristol or Chippenham in favour of a bought seat for Grampound. Addington converted him to support the resumption of war, and he defended territorial army measures, himself accepting a Wiltshire commission. Addington, who had wished to make him chairman of committees, appointed him secretary to the India Board of Control in November 1803. He followed Addington into opposition in May 1804 and was thought of for office when Addington (now Sidmouth) and Pitt were reconciled, but approved of Sidmouth's rift with government over Melville's conduct at the Admiralty in 1805.<br>
<br>When Sidmouth regained office in 1806 Hobhouse was appointed first commissioner for settling the Carnatic nawabs' debts (so remaining until 1829), and subsequently chairman of committees, both without salary. From 1806 he sat for Hindon on the Calthorpe interest, paying his expenses. He went into opposition with Sidmouth in 1807, and gave up his chairmanship for health reasons after the first session of that parliament. Ill health and differences from Sidmouth ensured that he abjured office, and he often voted with the opposition until 1812, when Sidmouth rejoined the government. He was appointed a commissioner of inquiry into Lincoln gaol in June, and created a baronet on 22 December 1812. He supported the government when present, albeit seldom vocally, in his last parliament. Retiring in 1818 when his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13404/', "John Cam Hobhouse")</script>, espoused radical politics, he was disappointed in his wish for a peerage. He was FRS, FSA, a vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature, and president in 1805&#150;17 of the West of England Agricultural Society, which commissioned his bust by Chantrey for their Bath premises. He died on 14 August 1831 at his Berkeley Square house in London.<br>
