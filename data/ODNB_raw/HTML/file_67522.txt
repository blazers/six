<span class="headword">Mackenzie,  Colin, of Kintail</span>, first earl of Seaforth  (<em>c.</em>1597&#150;1633), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76547/', "Kenneth Mackenzie, first Lord Mackenzie of Kintail (d. 1611)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70945/', "Mackenzie family of Kintail")</script>], and his wife, Jean (<i>d</i>. 1604), daughter of George Ross of Balnagowan. Following the death of his father, on 27 February 1611 his minority was dispensed with &#145;by royal precept&#146;, and he inherited estates in the Isle of Lewis and Ross-shire. On 5 June 1614 his political connections were secured by his marriage to Lady Margaret Seton (1599&#150;1630), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25113/', "Alexander Seton, first earl of Dunfermline (1556&#150;1622)")</script>, lord chancellor of Scotland, and his first wife, Lilias Drummond. In August 1616 he was appointed JP for Elgin, Forres, and Nairn, a commission renewed on 20 August 1623. He sat as a lord of the Scottish parliament in June 1617 and August 1621, when he voted against ratifying the five articles of Perth.<br>
<br>Having been created earl of Seaforth on 3 December 1623, he continued to serve as justice and to improve the administration of his estates in Lewis, Kintail, Lochalsh, Lochcarron, Strathconnon, and Lochbrune. He generated controversy in June 1628 when he proposed that Stornoway in Lewis be converted into a royal burgh: this plan was vigorously challenged and defeated by the convention of royal burghs, on the grounds that Seaforth was illegally employing Dutch colonists instead of lowland Scots. His other development projects were less provocative. Reputed to have been &#145;a most religious &amp; vertuous Lord&#146;  (NL Scot., Adv. MS 34.6.27, fol. 27<i>r</i>), committed to kirk plantation and ministerial maintenance in the highlands, by the end of his life he had built churches in each of his baronies, and endowed Chanonry with 4000 merks Scots to establish a grammar school.<br>
<br>Seaforth attended the king at Whitehall in 1629, and was again summoned to court on 3 December 1630, remaining until at least 14 July 1631, when he complained that his brother-in-law Lord Reay had falsely accused him of criticizing the earl of Menteith; despite this accusation, Charles permitted him to travel to Essex to recuperate from an undisclosed sickness, and further bolstered his reputation by proclaiming him &#145;the best archer in Britain&#146;  (Mackenzie, 246). After a long illness Seaforth died at his family seat in Chanonry, Ross-shire, on 15 April 1633, and was buried at Chanonry church on 28 May, having been predeceased by his wife (1630) and son, Alexander (1629). His daughters, Jean and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4467/', "Anna Mackenzie")</script>, were declared his heir-portioners on 29 November 1636, while his title passed to his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17578/', "George Mackenzie, second earl of Seaforth (d. 1651)")</script>.<br>
