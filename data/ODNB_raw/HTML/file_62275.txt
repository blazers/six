<span class="headword">Fiedler,  Hermann Georg</span>  (1862&#150;1945), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 28 April 1862 at Zittau, Saxony, the second of three children of August Fiedler (1837&#150;1912) and Minna Grossmann (1842&#150;1894). His father was <i>Musikdirektor</i> at Zittau and his elder brother (August) Max Fiedler (1859&#150;1939) became one of the most renowned conductors of his time. His sister (Minna) Elise (Mrs Karl Wichmann) was, in 1903, the first woman to be awarded a doctorate (DLitt) by the University of Birmingham. In his notes for an autobiography, Fiedler describes his idyllic youth in the pleasant kingdom of Saxony and his loving and hard-working family. After passing his &#145;Abitur&#146; exam at the Zittau Gymnasium in March 1881, he went on to study German philology and literature at the University of Leipzig under Friedrich Zarncke. He took the PhD degree in July 1888 and in October of the same year, through Zarncke's intercession, he was appointed lecturer in German at Queen Margaret College and the University of Glasgow. This was to be his first step towards a successful career in Britain, the country he had toured with his brother Max in 1885 and to which he had since longed to return.<br>
<br>In October 1890 Fiedler was elected to the German professorship at Mason College, which was later to become the University of Birmingham. He gave lectures on Goethe and Wagner, as well as courses entitled &#145;Writers of modern Germany&#146; and &#145;Recent German literature&#146;, and a popular series of lectures on several aspects of German culture and society. His commitment to the reorganization of the university, including the creation in 1903 of the school of modern languages, gave him a privileged place in Birmingham academic circles. His marriage, on 13 December 1899, at the Bristol Street Unitarian Church, Birmingham, to his former pupil Ethel Mary (1870/71&#150;1933), daughter of the lawyer and governor of the university Charles Harding, further consolidated his ties to English society. He and his wife had two daughters, Herma (<i>b</i>. 1902) and Beryl (<i>b</i>. 1913). His relationship with Ethel began to deteriorate about the time of their move to Oxford due to her bouts of depression which worsened irrevocably when their younger daughter became ill with diphtheria in 1915. The child's death, on 2 May 1920, caused Ethel's complete withdrawal from society until her death in 1933.<br>
<br>After having visited Oxford as a Taylor lecturer and external examiner for five consecutive years, Fiedler was appointed to the new chair of German on 12 July 1907. He soon became a driving force within the university, and as chairman of the faculty board played a vital role in the establishment of the honour school of modern languages. During his first years at Oxford he formed a close and lasting friendship with Gerhart Hauptmann who, mainly thanks to Fiedler, had been awarded an honorary degree at Oxford in 1905. In 1909 he became the supervisor of the poet Ernst Stadler, a Rhodes Scholar who studied for a BLitt in modern languages. From 1912 to 1914 he was tutor to the prince of Wales, whom he accompanied to Germany twice during the spring and summer of 1913 and with whom he remained in contact throughout his life.<br>
<br>In 1915, the publication of Fiedler's <span class="italic">Oxford Book of German Verse</span> marked the end of the most successful decade in his life. Although officially a British citizen since 1911, during the war he was fiercely attacked in the student newspaper <span class="italic">The Varsity</span>, and in the summer of 1915 handed in his resignation, which was rejected. In November 1918 the vice-chancellor proposed a special vote of thanks to Fiedler for the way in which he had kept the German department working during the war. In 1926 he became secretary to the curators of the Taylor Institution. In this capacity he supervised the erection of the Taylor extension, which was opened by the prince of Wales in 1932, and worked incessantly towards the improvement of the Taylor Library. His research covered a wide range of subjects, but he produced no single work of lasting significance. His most significant publications, apart from the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of German Verse</span> (1915) and the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of German Prose</span> (1943), are an edition of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust II</span> and his <span class="italic">Textual Studies on Goethe's Faust</span> (1946). He published a number of textbooks and contributed articles to several periodicals, including <span class="italic">Das Literarische Echo</span> and the <span class="italic">Modern Language Quarterly</span>.<br>
<br>Fiedler's most lasting legacy resides in his tenacious effort to promote a fruitful intercultural relationship between Germany and Britain. His true gift lay in his remarkable talent as a teacher. He was 5 feet 6 inches tall, had brown eyes, &#145;the moustache of a German burgher&#146;  (Wroughton, 4), and a sympathetic expression. Gerhart Hauptmann's literary tribute to him, Professor Geiger in <span class="italic">Vor Sonnenuntergang</span> (1932), is the affectionate portrait of a wise and jovial old man whose age and profession are almost at odds with his youthful vitality. Fiedler retired in 1937 and died at his home, the Lane House, Norham Road, Oxford, on 10 April 1945.<br>
