<span class="headword">Rawlinson, Sir  Robert</span>  (1810&#150;1898), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Bristol on 28 February 1810, the son of Thomas Rawlinson, a builder, of Chorley, Lancashire, and his wife, Grace Ellice of Exeter. He was educated at Lancaster, where his father moved shortly after his birth, and for a time assisted his father in his business as a builder, contractor, and millwright. He married in 1831 Ruth, daughter of Thomas Swallow of Lockwood, Yorkshire, and in the same year joined the civil engineering contractor Jesse Hartley, where he remained until 1836, working mainly on dock and harbour construction. He then worked under Robert Stephenson on the building of the London and Birmingham Railway.<br>
<br>In 1840 Rawlinson returned to Liverpool, becoming assistant surveyor to the corporation, and from 1843 to 1847 was employed as chief engineer under the Bridgewater trust. During this period, means of improving Liverpool's water supply were under discussion, and he advocated the utilization of Bala Lake in Wales as a reservoir for the city. A form of Rawlinson's scheme was eventually realized in the 1890s.<br>
<br>In 1848 Rawlinson was appointed a government public health inspector under the <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span> and later became head of the department. It was, however, through his dedicated and technically innovative work as head of the sanitary commission which was sent out by the government to the Crimea to investigate the sanitary conditions of the British army at Sevastopol that the foundations of Rawlinson's most important and enduring work in the field of public health and sanitation were laid. On his return from the Crimea Rawlinson took up his duties as chief engineering inspector under the Local Government Board, and prepared and published some highly influential guidelines for improved town sewerage and domestic drainage systems, intended for the engineers and surveyors to local boards, which contributed greatly to the development of urban sanitation for the rest of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1863 Rawlinson served as a member of the army sanitary committee. In April of that year, during the cotton famine in Lancashire, he was sent by Lord Palmerston, the prime minister, to organize relief works for the thousands of men and women thrown idle by the stoppage of the cotton supply from America owing to the civil war. The works he then started occupied his attention until 1869. In 1865 and in 1868 he was chairman of the commissions appointed to inquire into the best means of preventing industrial river pollution; and in 1876 he served on another commission considering town sewerage. In 1884 he was president of the congress of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain held at Dublin, and published the address he delivered in that capacity.<br>
<br>For his many valuable services in connection with public health and sanitation Rawlinson was knighted on 24 July 1883, and in January 1888 he was made KCB. In that year he retired from the office which he had held for forty years as chief engineering inspector to the Local Government Board. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in March 1848; he served on its council for many years and became president in May 1894 when he was eighty-four. His presidential address was published in the same year. He died at his home, Lancaster Lodge, 11 The Boltons, South Kensington, on 31 May 1898, and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 4 June.<br>
