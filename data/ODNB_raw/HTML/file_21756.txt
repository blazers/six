<span class="headword">Peden,  Alexander</span>  (1626?&#150;1686), <span class="occ">preacher</span>, was born probably in 1626, probably at Auchencloich, near Sorn, Ayrshire, the eldest son in a modestly propertied family on good terms with the Boswells of Auchinleck and other local gentry. Possibly after schooling at nearby Mauchline he attended Glasgow University between 1643 and 1648. Thereafter his movements are uncertain but he was most likely serving as schoolmaster or family tutor in different places. He was certainly schoolmaster, session clerk, and precentor at Tarbolton, 10 miles from his birthplace, during John Guthrie's ministry. In 1659 Peden passed his trials for licence in the presbytery of Biggar and Lanark, although Ayr presbytery may have been responsible for the actual licensing. It was while a probationer under the latter that a woman in Tarbolton accused him of fathering her child. The charge was exposed as false when the woman committed suicide, but Peden, who never married, may have been left scarred.<br>
<br>In 1659 Peden was ordained to New Luce in Wigtownshire, where he served until ejected in 1662 for refusing to conform to episcopacy. His parting sermon, on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 20: 31&#150;2, lasted until midnight. He then symbolically barred the church door against an intruded successor; there was none, in fact, until after the revolution of 1688&#150;9. Peden now took to field preaching over much of southern and central Scotland, becoming the most revered and romanticized of all the conventicle preachers. He exerted a profound hold over common folk by his oracular style, rich in vivid imagery and blunt aphorisms and elevated by a prophetic inspiration. Peden &#145;the prophet&#146; combined a kind of second sight (insight and foresight together) with impassioned forewarning of imminent peril or unseen hope. His prophecies also assumed a denunciatory directness, decreeing by prediction death, or woe on specific godless individuals.<br>
<br>From early 1663 Peden was a marked man. Declared a rebel and forfeited on 25 January 1666, he was excluded from the pardon of 1 October 1667 after the Pentland rising. He retreated to Ireland between 1670 and 1673, but was apprehended in June 1673 in Knockdow, Ayrshire. After trial in Edinburgh before the privy council on 26 June he was imprisoned, with some forty covenanters, on the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth until 9 October 1677, and thereafter in Edinburgh tolbooth. Refused release to move to Ireland, he was sentenced instead to transportation to Virginia and left Scotland in December 1678, but after the sea journey to London he and others were set free when the outward bound captain refused to carry prisoners sentenced for religious convictions. After six months Peden returned to Scotland.<br>
<br>In the next few obscure years Peden paid at least two visits to Ireland. In 1685 he preached his last sermon, at Colinswood on the Water of Ayr. Prematurely aged and debilitated, he found shelter in a cave on the banks of the Ayr near Sorn. Sensing approaching death, he moved to his brother's house at Auchinleck, where he died on 28 January 1686. Buried at Auchinleck church, his remains were disinterred six weeks later by government troops. Failing to hang the corpse on the gallows at nearby Cumnock, they buried it at their foot. Out of reverence for Peden the community adopted the spot as their burial-ground. South and central Scotland is dotted with sites honouring Peden's memory&#151;Peden's Pulpit, Peden's Stone&#151;and some monuments were, even in the late twentieth century, still the scene of commemorative services. Patrick Walker assiduously assembled his experiences and prophecies, although only two sermons, preached when he revisited his old parish in 1682, survive; they were published as <span class="italic">The Lord's Trumpet Sounding an Alarm</span> (1720?). No other covenanter's name took such affectionate root among widespread localities.<br>
