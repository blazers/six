<span class="headword">Lamerie,  Paul Jacques  de</span>  (1688&#150;1751), <span class="occ">goldsmith</span>, was born on 9 April 1688 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, the only child of Paul Souchay de la Merie and his wife, Constance le Roux. His father, an officer in William III's army, moved to London in 1689 and Paul was apprenticed to his fellow Huguenot, the goldsmith Pierre Platel, in August 1703. In February 1713 de Lamerie set up his own workshop in Windmill Street, where he rapidly established his prominence as both manufacturer and retailer. Early customers included Sir William Trumbull, Baron Foley, and the jewel house of George I.<br>
<br>Between 1723 and 1728 de Lamerie was in partnership with Ellis Gamble, the latter apparently running the retail side of the business. Gamble had been the master of William Hogarth, who trained as an engraver on silver before turning to copperplate-engraving and painting. The Gamble&#150;de Lamerie partnership (discovered in the late twentieth century) supports the long-standing attribution to Hogarth of the engraving on the famous exchequer seal salver made for Sir Robert Walpole.<br>
<br>In 1738 de Lamerie moved to Gerrard Street and served as captain and later major in the Westminster volunteer association. In 1737&#150;8 he served on a committee of the Goldsmiths' Company, promoting the <span class="roman">Plate Offences Act</span>, and moved up through the hierarchy of the court, only failing to serve as prime warden. He supplied a magnificent ewer and rose water basin to the company's order in 1741, richly chased with rococo ornament. Characteristically, he charged considerably more than had been agreed for the work; the ewer and basin weighed 570 ounces, substantially more than the requested maximum.<br>
<br>De Lamerie was always ready to flout the company's regulations, failing to register two alternative versions of his new sterling (Britannia) mark, and was criticized by the company for failing to submit plate for assay and hallmarking in 1717. He evaded the duty payable from 1719 on newly wrought plate by inserting already hallmarked discs into newly made wares. His wares made up the largest individual parcel in a massive consignment of plate exported to the Tsarina Anna in 1726, much of which again had paid no duty.<br>
<br>Since no ledgers survive, the size of de Lamerie's business and the names of his suppliers can only be suggested. His was for thirty-five years the pre-eminent retail business at the upper end of the market, supplying tableware and massive buffet plate to the jewel house and the Russian court (tsarinas Anna and Catherine, and Count Bobrinsky). His long-standing clients included Sir Robert Walpole, the earl of Ilchester, the earl of Thanet, Viscount Tyrconnel, the duke of Bedford, Baron Anson, and a cross-section of the English nobility and gentry.<br>
<br>The diversity and volume of silver bearing de Lamerie's mark is far greater than can have emerged from a single workshop and it came to be generally acknowledged, after a century dominated by the concept of the maker's mark, that de Lamerie, in common with many other goldsmiths registering marks at Goldsmiths' Hall, not only fulfilled orders with other goldsmiths' wares but also subcontracted orders to a range of London workshops, although striking the finished wares with his own punch. His choice of modellers, chasers, and other specialists was the key to his commercial success. His marks appear overstruck by that of Paul Crespin on ambassadorial plate issued to the earl of Chesterfield in 1727; although George Wickes supplied the Bath presentation cup to Frederick Louis, prince of Wales, in 1739, it has much in common with a contemporary series of cups with de Lamerie's mark.<br>
<br>For twenty years de Lamerie's silver shows a strong dependence on French <i>r&eacute;gence</i> designs, and techniques such as heavy formal cast and applied ornament, but from the late 1720s his work demonstrates asymmetry, with rich figurative chasing and a revival of the auricular and <i>massive</i> motifs of a century earlier. The distinctive style of the modeller James Shruder, who was in his employment in 1751 and sorted out his estate, can be recognized in de Lamerie's output from the 1730s, as can that of Charles Frederick Kandler I.<br>
<br>By the late twentieth century de Lamerie's silver was to be found dispersed across the world: a pair of chandeliers in the Kremlin Armoury, Moscow; a massive fountain and cistern in St Petersburg; a large collection in the Los Angeles County Museum; and in Great Britain important silver bearing his mark at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, and the Mansion House.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1717 de Lamerie married Louisa Juliott. They had two sons and four daughters. De Lamerie died in London on 1 August 1751 and was buried at St Anne's, Soho. Obituaries stressed his standing as master silversmith, &#145;very instrumental in bringing that Branch of Trade to the Perfection it is now in&#146;.<br>
