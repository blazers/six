<span class="headword">Rumsey,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1660&#150;1686), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, is of unknown parentage, and served as a cornet in the New Model Army. After the Restoration he served with English forces in Portugal for seven years under Lord Schomberg, achieving the rank of lieutenant-colonel. According to Burnet &#145;he did a brave action in that service, and Schomberg writ a particular letter to the king setting it out&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.357). Rumsey returned from Lisbon in 1667. Following a trip to Jersey in late February he was ordered to join the forces fighting the Dutch. When they were disbanded several months later his return to Portugal was delayed by illness. In 1669, while awaiting another military assignment, Rumsey was awarded an allowance of &pound;200 a year to be paid out of Queen Catherine's portion for his former &#145;merit and behaviour&#146; in his majesty's services  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1668&#150;9</i>, 152). By April 1673 he had become the collector of customs at Bristol on the recommendation of the earl of Clarendon. In 1675 Rumsey wrote to Secretary Williamson warning the court of &#145;the disadvantage that the persecution&#146; of Bristol dissenters would bring upon his majesty  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1673&#150;5</i>, 517). While in Bristol, Rumsey married Anna Smyth, the widow of his friend Sir Hugh Smyth. She was the daughter of the royalist John Ashburnham.<br>
<br>By 1670 Rumsey had become acquainted with the first earl of Shaftesbury and was active in the latter's mining enterprises. At one point he was the chief steward of the mines with a salary of &pound;100 and a free share of the company. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, as Shaftesbury increasingly became the vortex of opposition, Rumsey was ever by his side. Burnet described him as one of &#145;lord Shaftesbury's creatures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.373). The Scottish conspirator William Carstares called Rumsey and Robert Ferguson Shaftesbury's &#145;retainers&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters Addressed to William Carstares</span>, Edinburgh, 1774, 9). Amid the exclusion crisis Rumsey moved to Soho and joined the notorious Green Ribbon Club. In 1680 he helped to plan the duke of Monmouth's west country progress. He also went to Bristol with Shaftesbury and Monmouth to help Nathaniel Wade organize the whigs there.<br>
<br>In summer and autumn 1682 Rumsey and Ferguson served as Shaftesbury's envoys to a small circle of whig leaders, including William, Lord Russell, Lord Grey of Werk, Colonel Algernon Sidney, Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, and Lord Howard of Escrick, as well as a larger cabal of former soldiers, barristers, and artisans. According to later confessions in those months a series of discussions took place concerning the leading of a general insurrection against the government. Rumsey and Wade were to lead the rising in Bristol; Monmouth and Russell in Cheshire; John Trenchard in Taunton, and lords Howard and Grey in Essex. But in December Shaftesbury learned that the government was preparing to arrest him and he went into hiding. A month later he left England for the last time, seeking refuge in Amsterdam and taking Rumsey, Ferguson, and Captain Thomas Walcott with him.<br>
<br>After Shaftesbury's death in January 1683 his servants returned to London and the discussion of sedition among the whig conspirators was revived. Further, more serious consideration was now given to a plan to assassinate Charles II and his Catholic brother, the duke of York, at Rye House mill as they returned from the races at Newmarket [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93794', "Rye House plotters")</script>]. According to Burnet &#145;Rumsey, Ferguson, and West were often talking of the danger to executing this [an insurrection], and that the shorter and surer way was to kill the two brothers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.359). All their talk, however, came to nothing, when, on June 12, their plans were betrayed to Secretary Jenkins by one of their own, Josiah Keeling.<br>
<br>Aware that their discussions had been exposed several of the plotters including Rumsey met one last time on 17 June. Nathaniel Wade proposed that they immediately muster what men they could and lead a rising &#145;here or in the west to die like men than be hanged like dogs&#146;. But Rumsey flatly declared that their situation was hopeless, &#145;The hearts of the people are down and our great men are good for nothing&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.409). On 23 June a proclamation offered a reward of &pound;100 apiece for the apprehension of Rumsey, Walcott, Wade, and others. The next day Rumsey surrendered to the duke of Albemarle and was interrogated by the privy council. As an associate of Shaftesbury's he may have felt he was a marked man and so along with the barrister Robert West he began to recount the story of the Rye House plot, as it soon became known. Charles II himself examined Rumsey on 27 June.<br>
<br>According to Ormond, Rumsey was &#145;highly obligated by the King and the Duke that he has made himself a good fortune &hellip; and he seemed to me to be more concerned for the infamy of such ingratitude than for his own life, of which all men say he was upon service very little careful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 7.53&#150;4). Rumsey also faced family pressure. The week of his arrest his wife, Anna, was extremely sick and her daughter, Elizabeth Smyth, persuaded Rumsey to confess all he knew for her mother's sake. In the subsequent treason trials Rumsey testified against Captain Walcott, Lord Russell, and Algernon Sidney, all three of whom were executed. Rumsey was also used as a witness, following Monmouth's failed rebellion, in the trials of Henry Cornish and Lord Brandon in 1685. In July 1686 Rumsey tried to bribe a yearly pension out of Thomas Grey, earl of Stamford, a former associate of Shaftesbury's, in return for which Rumsey agreed to withhold evidence of Stamford's complicity in the Rye House plot. Both were arrested, and Stamford was committed to the Tower though he was eventually pardoned.<br>
<br>Needless to say Rumsey's willingness to turn king's evidence earned him a poor reputation among fellow whigs. Burnet recounted how Lord Russell had told him that every time he saw Rumsey &#145;he felt such a secret aversion to him, that he was in no danger of trusting him much&#146;. Burnet and others also asserted that Rumsey was &#145;a spy of the court's which some suspected he was all along&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.357&#150;8). Fellow conspirator Richard Rumbold declared, &#145;I am convinced [Rumsey] hath been the Duke of Yorks spie and trepan managed by the Duke of Beaufort ever since he was the little Lords privado&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/430/16). Apparently the court never trusted Rumsey either. He was excepted from James II's general pardon in March 1686 and sent to St Nicholas Island a month later for the remainder of his life.<br>
