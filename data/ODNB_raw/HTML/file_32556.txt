<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thompson</span>  (1837&#150;1904), <span class="occ">biographer and journalist</span>, born at Cambridge on 8 January 1837, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6212/', "Charles Henry Cooper (1808&#150;1866)")</script>, the Cambridge antiquary, and his wife, Jane, the youngest daughter of John Thompson of Prickwillow, Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>A younger brother, John William Cooper (1845&#150;1906), who graduated from Trinity Hall, Cambridge (LLB 1866, LLD 1880), was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1868, but lived in Cambridge almost all his life, taking a prominent part in municipal affairs. He revised his father's <span class="italic">Annals of Cambridge</span>, to which he added a fifth volume. He died at Cambridge on 10 November 1906.<br>
<br>Thompson Cooper, educated at a private school kept at Cambridge by the Revd John Orman, was articled to his father, who had become a solicitor in 1840, but the law was only nominally Thompson's vocation. His real inheritance from his father was a love of biographical and antiquarian research, and he was elected FSA at the age of twenty-three. He married young, his wife (<i>d</i>. 1896) being a widow with two young daughters, though they had no further children. He was converted to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>While still a boy Cooper began to collect material for a work modelled on the <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> of Anthony Wood. His father collaborated in the project, and in 1858 they published the first volume of <span class="italic">Athenae Cantabrigienses</span>, containing memoirs of those eminent alumni of Cambridge who died between 1500 and 1585. A second volume, published in 1861, carried the work forward to 1609.<br>
<br>In 1861 Cooper began his career in journalism as sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. In 1862 he was made its parliamentary reporter. He became an authority on the history of shorthand, publishing a manual on the Mason-Gurney system as early as 1858. A long connection with <span class="italic">The Times</span> lasted from 1866 until his death. He was one of its parliamentary reporters from 1866 to 1886, when he was appointed to write the daily summary of the debates in the House of Commons&#151;a task requiring unusual accuracy, conciseness, and familiarity with parliamentary and public affairs. In 1898 he took on the less arduous duties of summary-writer in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Cooper was associated with the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> from its inception. In 1883 Leslie Stephen appointed him to compile the lengthy lists of proposed entries which were published every six months in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> to elicit information and comment. He himself wrote 1423 entries&#151;much the largest contribution by any one author. He specialized in Roman Catholic subjects, but was also responsible for Cambridge graduates of early date, modern journalists, and shorthand writers. His literary and historical insight was not profound, but he had the gift of serendipity and never lost his zest for research.<br>
<br>In 1869 Cooper projected a new periodical, the <span class="italic">Register and Magazine of Biography</span>, but it ceased with the completion of one volume. His <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span>, mainly of Englishmen, which first appeared in 1873, incorporated some of the material he had collected for the then unpublished third volume of <span class="italic">Athenae Cantabrigienses</span> (finally published, with additions and corrections, together with an index, by G. J. Gray in 1913). He also wrote the text for a series of contemporary profiles entitled <span class="italic">Men of Mark</span> (1876&#150;83), and was responsible for four editions of <span class="italic">Men of the time</span> (1872, 1875, 1879, and 1884). He was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> from the age of sixteen until the year before his death. Cooper died at his house, 38 Loughborough Road, Brixton, London, on 5 March 1904, and was buried, with Roman Catholic rites, in Norwood cemetery, London.<br>
