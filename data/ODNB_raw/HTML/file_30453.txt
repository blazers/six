<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  Robert  Armstrong-</span>  (1857&#150;1943), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born at Llwyn-y-mafon-isaf, Ynyscynhaearn, Caernarvonshire, Wales, on 2 December 1857, the second child and eldest son of the ten children of the Reverend Thomas Jones, Independent minister and farmer, of Eisteddfa, Cricieth, and his wife, Jane Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Jones, also of Eisteddfa. His mother claimed to be twenty-first in lineal descent from Collyn ap Tangno, lord of Eifionydd. He assumed the additional surname of Armstrong in 1913. Jones was educated at Porthmadog grammar school, at Grove Park School, Wrexham, and at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. After six months' apprenticeship to a Dr Roberts at Porthmadog, he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1876, where he gained the Wix essay and Hitchens prize. He qualified as LSA (1880), MB (London, 1880), and MD (1883). He was admitted MRCP in 1900 and FRCP in 1907. Leaving St Bartholomew's in 1880 he was junior medical officer at the Royal Earlswood Institution for Idiots for two years, and then at the Colney Hatch Asylum for six years. He had an early inclination towards surgery and in 1885 took the FRCS, but soon decided that psychiatry was to be his life's work. In 1888 he returned to Earlswood as medical superintendent, and then in 1893 became the first medical superintendent of the London County Council's new asylum at Claybury, in Essex. In that year he also married Margaret Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. May 1943), daughter of Sir Owen Roberts who was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for the counties of London and Caernarfon. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Armstrong-Jones remained at Claybury for twenty-three years, resigning in 1916. His medical and administrative ability, and the research work of his colleague Frederick Mott spread the renown of Claybury far and wide. It was the first asylum under municipal control to receive paying patients and the first to institute a systematic course of training for psychiatric nurses. His work to promote psychiatric nursing was recognized by the order of St John of Jerusalem, who awarded him a knighthood of grace. As Claybury's directing genius, Armstrong-Jones played a crucial role in ushering in more scientific methods of treating mental illness. He was also noted for his support of occupational therapy and for his teaching of students. He was for many years consulting physician in psychological medicine to St Bartholomew's Hospital, and during the First World War he acted in a similar role to the London and Aldershot commands, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>From 1921 until 1931 Armstrong-Jones was one of the three lord chancellor's visitors in lunacy. He was a justice of the peace for Essex and justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for the counties of London and Caernarfon and in 1929 high sheriff of Caernarvonshire. Armstrong-Jones had firmly held religious beliefs and in 1910 he gave evidence on behalf of the British Medical Association to the royal commission on divorce and matrimonial causes, and in 1920 he served on the archbishop of Canterbury's special committee on spiritual healing. Armstrong-Jones was Gresham professor of physic (1917&#150;27), general secretary of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association (1897&#150;1906), and its president (1906&#150;7), president of the section of psychological medicine of the British Medical Association (1903), and of the section of psychiatry of the Royal Society of Medicine (1929). He was knighted in 1917 and made CBE in 1919 in recognition of his war services. He received the honorary degree of DSc from the University of Wales in 1920. He travelled as far afield as Russia, Poland, and Tunisia to visit psychiatric hospitals, and was keenly interested in social questions, on which he wrote vigorous letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He published a <span class="italic">Text-Book of Mental and Sick Nursing</span> (1907) and contributed many articles to encyclopaedias, treatises, and journals. Armstrong-Jones was well known and admired for his tact, enthusiasm, and energy. His grandson, Antony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones, earl of Snowdon, married Princess Margaret (Rose), younger sister of Elizabeth II. Armstrong-Jones died on 30 January 1943 at his home at Plas Dinas, Caernarfon.<br>
