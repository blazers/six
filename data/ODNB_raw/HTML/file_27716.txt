<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trevelyan, Sir  Charles Edward</span>, first baronet  (1807&#150;1886), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, fourth son of George Trevelyan (1764&#150;1827), archdeacon of Taunton, and his wife, Harriet (1773&#150;1854), third daughter of Sir Richard Neave, baronet, was born at Taunton on 2 April 1807. His widowed mother, Harriet Trevelyan, was among five Trevelyan family members who received nearly &pound;27,000 in compensation for enslaved people on their Grenada estates after slave emancipation. He was educated at Taunton grammar school, at Charterhouse School from 1820, and at East India College, Haileybury. He entered the East India Company's Bengal service as a writer in 1826, having displayed from an early age a great proficiency in Indian languages. On 4 January 1827 he was appointed assistant to Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, the commissioner at Delhi, where, during a residence of four years, he was entrusted with several important missions. His time at Delhi, however, was perhaps most famous for his role in the &#145;breaking&#146; of the resident, Sir Edward Colebrooke, for corruption. Before leaving Delhi he also contributed from his own funds to the building of a broad street through a new suburb, which subsequently became known as Trevelyanpur. In 1831 he moved to Calcutta, and became deputy secretary to the government in the political department. On 23 December 1834 he married Hannah More, sister of Lord Macaulay, who was then a member of the council of the governor-general of India, and one of his closest friends. She died on 5 August 1873, leaving a son, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36555/', "Sir George Otto Trevelyan, baronet")</script>, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Trevelyan was especially interested in education, and had an important influence on Macaulay's celebrated minute of 1835, promulgating the teaching of European literature and science in India. In April 1836 he was nominated secretary to the Sudder board of revenue, which office he held until his return to England in January 1838. In India Trevelyan was, Macaulay recorded:<blockquote>a most stormy reformer &hellip; Lord William [Bentinck] said to me &hellip; &#145;That man is almost always on the right side in every question; and it is well that he is so, for he gives a most confounded deal of trouble when he happens to take the wrong one.&#146; (Macaulay to Mrs Cropper, 7 Dec 1834, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 278)</blockquote>On 21 January 1840 he became assistant secretary to the Treasury, London, and held this office for the next nineteen years. No civil servant did more to place the Treasury in its modern role of watchdog of the whole of the civil service. Trevelyan's zeal for retrenchment ill equipped him for his role of co-ordinator of relief during the Irish famine of 1845&#150;7 and he gained a reputation for brutal complacency (though his employment schemes had some success). He encouraged the passing of the <span class="roman">Poor Law Extension Act</span> in 1847, which gave the Treasury greater influence over the use of poor-law funds. Trevelyan was determined that relief should be financed by the raising of local rates rather than through grants from the Treasury. This involved him in a prolonged dispute with Edward Twistleton of the poor-law commissioners. <span class="italic">The Irish Crisis</span> (1848) summarizes Trevelyan's views. In 1848 Trevelyan was made KCB for his work in Ireland. In 1852&#150;3 he helped with reports on several government departments. One of these, by a Treasury minute written by Gladstone and dated 12 April 1854, led to the brief report known as the Northcote&#150;Trevelyan report  (&#145;Report on the organisation of a permanent civil service&#146;), one of the most famous documents of recent British history, which scathingly condemned the patronage system of civil service appointments and recommended open examination and promotion by merit, and sketched what became the administrative grade.<br>
<br>In 1858 Trevelyan was offered the governorship of Madras in succession to Lord Harris, and entered upon his duties in the spring of 1859. He was principally responsible for organizing a new police system and for establishing rights in land, which freed it from encumbrances and made it saleable in fee simple. In February 1860 James Wilson, financial member of the viceroy's council, proposed a plan of severe retrenchment and taxation by which he hoped to improve the financial position of the Indian government. On 4 March Trevelyan and the council of Madras sent a sharply critical response back to Calcutta by open telegram. For this they were censured and, at the same time, the representative of the Madras government in the central legislative council of India was prohibited from following the instructions of his superiors by laying upon the table and advocating the expression of their views. On 21 March a telegram was sent to Madras stating that the bill would be introduced and referred to a committee, which would report in five weeks, whereupon Trevelyan and his council recorded their opinions in a minute and, on the responsibility of Sir Charles alone, passed the document to the newspapers. On the arrival of this intelligence in England Trevelyan was at once recalled. This decision occasioned controversy both in and out of parliament. Palmerston, while defending the recall, spoke in praise of Trevelyan's character; and Sir Charles Wood, the president of the Board of Control, said:<blockquote>A more honest, zealous, upright, and independent servant could not be. He was a loss to India, but there would be danger if he were allowed to remain, after having adopted a course so subversive of all authority, so fearfully tending to endanger our rule, and so likely to provoke the people to insurrection against the central and responsible authority. (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 11 May 1860, vols. 1130&#150;61)</blockquote>Trevelyan's temporary disgrace was made more significant by his later triumph. In 1862 he went back to India as finance minister, an emphatic endorsement of the justness of his former views. His tenure of office was marked by increased government expenditure and by extensive measures for the development of public works. On his return home in 1865 he became involved in the question of army purchase, on which he had given evidence before the royal commission in 1857; he developed his views in <span class="italic">The British Army in 1868</span> (1868). Later his name was associated with a variety of social questions, such as charities and pauperism, on which he published several pamphlets. In 1874 he was created a baronet. He was a staunch Liberal, and gave his support to the Liberal cause in Northumberland, while residing at Wallington in that county, which he had inherited from his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27718/', "Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan")</script> in 1879. Sir Charles married second, on 14 October 1875, Eleanora Anne (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Walter Campbell of Islay. He is drawn by Trollope in <span class="italic">The Three Clerks</span> (1857) under the name of Sir Gregory Hardlines. He died at his home, 67 Eaton Square, London, on 19 June 1886.<br>
