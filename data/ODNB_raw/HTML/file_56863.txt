<span class="headword">Small,  Ann Hunter <span class="st"> [Annie]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1945), <span class="occ">missionary and educationist</span>, was born on 26 December 1857 at Polmont, Redding, Stirlingshire, the eldest of the three daughters, all subsequently missionaries, of the Revd John Small (1833&#150;1899), trained teacher and missionary of the Free Church of Scotland in India, and his wife, Nathina Hunter (1824/5 &#150; 14 April 1913). At six she went to India, where she was educated by her mother and learned the local language; from thirteen to seventeen she attended the School for the Daughters of Missionaries at Walthamstow, Essex, where her talents blossomed in a community which fostered individual development.<br>
<br>From 1876 to 1892 Annie Small worked in India, mainly as an agent of the Free Church of Scotland Ladies' Society for Female Education in India and South Africa, specializing in the expanding work among women. Her book, <span class="italic">Light and Shade in Zenana Missionary Life</span> (1890), graphically described the skills needed&#151;but seldom found&#151;in the new recruits sent out. Based mainly in Poona and influenced by her father's enlightened attitude, she gained deep insight into Indian culture and religion.<br>
<br>Small was invalided back to Britain in 1892, at a time when training for the increasing numbers of women missionaries had become urgent; this was pioneering work as there was then no special training for either male or female missionaries. Appointed in 1894 as the first principal of the Free Church Women's Missionary Training Institute in Edinburgh (later St Colm's Women's Missionary College of the United Free Church of Scotland), she aimed to make the institute a place of training for life, not &#145;a sort of hothouse for &#147;forcing&#148; a certain type of missionary character&#146;  (house guild letter, May 1909, St Colm's College). Treating her students as responsible individuals she sought personal development founded on the strong spiritual life of the college community, while not neglecting modern educational methods. The college attracted students from all denominations throughout Britain and beyond, especially from Switzerland, Germany, and Scandinavia.<br>
<br>Small exemplified her own ideal of the true missionary as &#145;a throughly furnished man or woman&#146;  (Small, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 154). She was a slight person, of simple tastes, sane, far-sighted, joyous, and deeply spiritual, an accomplished musician, and a graphic writer&#151;her works ranged from early books on India to biblical and devotional studies, notably <span class="italic">The Psalter and the Life of Prayer</span> (1912). Her interests ranged from the arts and crafts movement to the late nineteenth-century liturgical revival, from politics to the Celtic church. She is credited with drawing the attention of the Revd George MacLeod to Iona as a centre for his community. A proud presbyterian she nevertheless rejoiced in being part of the worldwide church in all its diversity, and her studies on Islam and Buddhism written for the Student Christian Movement show her enlightened attitude towards dialogue with other faiths&#151;a contrast to the empire-building view of missions of many of her contemporaries.<br>
<br>Annie Small's portrait in the college reveals a serene gentleness, though not the impressive presence radiating goodness remembered by those who knew her. Her ability to get on well with people extended from her students to many of the great figures of the time. Though never associated with the women's movement she was regarded with suspicion in some church circles for her advocacy of women's training. At the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference in 1910 she was secretary of Commission V whose remit was to study the preparation of missionaries; the commission's influential report recognized the excellence of St Colm's College. Honoured in missionary circles she became a sought-after leader of training courses for both sexes. The college became a model for new training institutions in England and abroad.<br>
<br>Small retired in 1913, exhausted&#151;her health was never strong. She continued to live in Edinburgh, a valued speaker at conferences and a profound influence on her many visitors. She died of a heart attack, in an Edinburgh nursing home, on 7 February 1945. In accordance with her will she was cremated, at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 10 February; she had directed that her ashes should be buried in the family grave at Arbroath Abbey. She never married.<br>
