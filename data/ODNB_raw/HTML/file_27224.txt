<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1712, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born in Abbey Street, St Mary's parish, Carlisle, and baptized in that parish on 7 October 1712, the eldest son of John Thomas (<i>c</i>.1684&#150;1747), minor canon of Carlisle Cathedral and vicar of Brampton, Cumberland, from 1721 to 1747, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Richard Kelsick of Whitehaven, a captain in the merchant navy.<br>
<br>Thomas, like his father, was educated at Carlisle grammar school, where he was admitted for the first time on 5 October 1719, and like his father he attended Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated as a commoner on 17 December 1730. He read for the BCL (1742), and the DCL (1742). During the mid-1730s he acted as assistant master at an academy in Soho Square, then became private tutor to William, the younger son of Sir William Clayton, his patron and future brother-in-law.<br>
<br>Thomas was ordained deacon on 27 March 1737, then priest on 25 September 1737. He soon received the valuable rectory of Bletchingley, Surrey, and was instituted on 27 January 1738. Thomas held the benefice until his advancement to a bishopric in 1774, and was a diligent, resident parish priest. He was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the king on 17 January 1749, and a canon of Westminster on 19 April 1754. He was a senior member of the abbey chapter for the remainder of his life, being named subdean on 4 July 1758, then dean of Westminster and chancellor of the Order of the Bath in 1768, in succession to his main clerical patron, Bishop Zachary Pearce. It was to Pearce that Thomas in confidence intimated that &#145;my present business is <i>to make Hay</i> while the Sun shines&#146;  (WAM 64447, 4 July 1762). There was every sign that he was doing so, for Archbishop Drummond of York had appointed Thomas sub-almoner on 28 December 1761, and he was admitted and instituted to the rectory of St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 7 January 1766. Thomas resigned both these last preferments on taking up the deanery, his preference before any smaller bishopric. He was chosen by Archbishop Cornwallis of Canterbury as his prolocutor to the lower house of convocation in 1768 and 1769. Thomas also followed Pearce in the bishopric of Rochester, in November 1774, holding it like his predecessor <i>in commendam</i> with the Westminster deanery. Thomas never lost sight of what he owed to Pearce, telling the Rochester clergy in 1776 he would &#145;ever account it my greatest merit to follow him, as a son would a father, though with very unequal steps&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 2.422).<br>
<br>Thomas regularly attended capitular meetings at Westminster and was active in abbey administration while successively canon steward and treasurer between 1754 and 1768. During his deanship, extensive repairs were undertaken to the deanery, the thirteenth century choir of the abbey was replaced with new fittings designed by Henry Keene, and the celebrated Handel memorial festival of 1784 was held with his encouragement. From the late 1780s illness confined him to the episcopal house at Bromley, so chapter documents were sealed without his signature.<br>
<br>While his health held Thomas involved himself fully in the Rochester diocese. He preached frequently at Bromley parish church (he spent &pound;500 on enlarging it), and regularly administered holy communion there. Episcopal visitations were undertaken in 1776 and 1780. He repaired the deanery at Rochester and between 1774 and 1776 spent &pound;3000 on rebuilding the bishop's palace at Bromley, and laid out and adorned the parkscape. A moderate whig and orthodox churchman, he was not involved in politics beyond lending his quiet support in the House of Lords to the administrations of lords North and Pitt. Thomas voted for Roman Catholic relief in 1780 despite a confrontation with the mob in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Thomas married first, on 19 August 1742, at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, Anne (<i>c</i>.1716&#150;1772), sister of Sir William Clayton, and widow of Sir Charles Blackwell, second baronet. She was four years Thomas's junior; she died on 7 July 1772. He married second, on 12 January 1775, by special licence, in Westminster Abbey, Elizabeth, of St George's, Hanover Square, the daughter of Charles Baldwin of Munslow, Shropshire, and widow of Sir Joseph Yates, a judge. There were no children from either marriage. His second wife shared her husband's interest in the fine arts and had copied some of Reynolds's pictures in needlework.<br>
<br>Bishop Thomas died at Bromley on 22 August 1793, after an illness lasting two days, and was buried in the vault at Bletchingley next to his first wife. A man of essentially modest ambition and unblemished life, he had carried out his clerical duties vigorously until ill health overtook him. Thomas was one of the foremost preachers in the reign of George III, and was much appreciated by the king personally. Many of his sermons and charges were published in his lifetime; a collected edition appeared in 1796. He also commanded the respect of his contemporaries on other counts, including his interest in architecture and the fine arts (he left a large collection of rare coins and medals, as well as prints and paintings). As his colleague on the Westminster chapter, Thomas Newton, put it, Thomas had &#145;a spirit and taste and elegance superior to most men&#146;  (Newton, 151). But it was above all for his charity that Bishop Thomas was renowned, as his bequests reveal. During his lifetime, his nephew estimated he had given out about &pound;50,000 in benefactions since about 1743, especially to clergy in financial distress. Thomas was vice-president of the Westminster Infirmary, and a governor of the Middlesex Hospital, and he endowed two scholarships at Westminster School.<br>
