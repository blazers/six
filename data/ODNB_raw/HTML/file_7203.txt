<span class="headword">Davenport,  Richard Alfred</span>  (1776/7&#150;1852), <span class="occ">author and publisher</span>, was born in Lambeth, and may have been the Richard Davenport who was baptized at St Mary, Lambeth, on 23 February 1777. On 6 September 1800 he married Selina Granville Wheler (1779&#150;1859), daughter of Captain Charles Granville Wheler. His first venture into publishing appears to have been the (notionally) annual <span class="italic">Poetical Register</span>, which first appeared in 1801. This featured often coruscating reviews of other poetical compilations, and numerous examples of his own verse which, even allowing for romantic affectation, showed a depressive streak. &#145;An admonitory epistle&#146;, an attack on alarmist anti-Jacobinism from 1809, betrayed political sympathies with the whiggery of moderate reform. In June of the same year he tried a begging letter to the politician William Windham, addressed from Twickenham, Middlesex, in which he pleaded his inability to provide for his family. About this time he separated from his wife, Selina, with whom he had two daughters. A son, Theodore Alfred Davenport, who according to Davenport's will became professor in the college of Boulogne, seems not to have been a result of the marriage. His wife, from whom he seems never to have been divorced, went on to open a school at Greenwich, and between 1813 and about 1835 wrote eleven novels. No further details of Davenport's personal circumstances have been discovered beyond his shifts of address; by September 1810 he was at Perry Hill, Sydenham, Surrey. The <span class="italic">Poetical Register</span> ceased in 1814, with the belated publication of the volumes for 1810&#150;11. By 1809 Davenport was also styling himself in correspondence as editor of the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> (the title published by the Rivingtons, which ceased about 1812), to which he had previously been a contributor.<br>
<br>Subsequently Davenport found a niche as a prolific writer of books and articles on history, biography, and criticism: he was a contributor to <span class="italic">The British Poets</span>, published by Charles Whittingham (1822), and among his own compilations of ephemera were <span class="italic">New Elegant Extracts</span> (1823&#150;7) and <span class="italic">The Commonplace Book of Epigrams</span> (1825). By May 1830 he had evidently moved to Camberwell, Surrey, where he resided from about 1841 at Brunswick Cottage, Park Street. His energy for written composition never flagged, and his works contain internal evidence of hard toil and a painstaking attention to detail: his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Biography</span> (1831) featured 4000&#150;5000 entries and international coverage. While in its preface he regretted that his <span class="italic">History of the Bastille</span> (1835) was not comprehensive, he was none the less pleased to denominate it &#145;the only work in the English language to have the slightest pretension&#146; to cover the subject, and was vindicated by reprints in 1838, 1876, and 1883. Among his revisions and continuations of existing works were editions of William Mitford's <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> (1835) and two revised editions of Matthew Pilkington's <span class="italic">General Dictionary of Painters</span> (1829 and 1851).<br>
<br>In 1850 the author John Britton wrote of Davenport:<blockquote>This laborious, critical and acute writer is scarcely known to the public, nor even to the literati of the present time. A devoted student and lover of books, he has lived in the midst of these fascinating companions, and has neglected to cultivate an intimacy with the world, which owes him much. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 525)</blockquote>Davenport died on 25 January 1852 at Brunswick Cottage, in circumstances that lent a savage irony to the title of his 1841 potboiler, <span class="italic">Lives of Individuals who Raised themselves from Poverty to Eminence and Fortune</span>. A passing policeman heard moans, and inside found Davenport semi-conscious, clutching a bottle of laudanum, and surrounded by empties. He was beyond medical assistance; a coroner's jury found that he had died of an accidental overdose. At Brunswick Cottage they found all the windows broken, and the interior &#145;crowded with books, papers, pictures, coins and curiosities, but all covered in dust, for no one remembered that the house had been cleaned in the eleven years he had occupied it&#146;  (ibid.). This squalid yet picturesque scene of artistic poverty was lovingly dwelt upon by contemporary obituaries and memoirs. Davenport's library was sold in April. He left his house and meagre personal estate to his son, and requested burial at Nunhead cemetery, in the plot next to a Mrs Manison or Mannion, &#145;one of the most amiable and kind hearted of human beings&#146;  (Davenport, will). His erroneous identification as Robert Davenport on his death certificate bore further testimony, if it were needed, to his thorough estrangement from society at large.<br>
