<span class="headword">Smith <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Wardle, Sheehy]</span>,  Madeleine Hamilton</span>  (1835/6&#150;1928), <span class="occ">accused poisoner</span>, was born in 1835 or in the first quarter of 1836, eldest of three daughters and two sons of James Smith (1808&#150;1863), a rich Glasgow architect, and his wife, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12059/', "David Hamilton (1768&#150;1843)")</script>, architect. Educated for three years at Mrs Gorton's Academy for Young Ladies, a boarding-school at Clapton, near Hackney, until 1853, she was a serious, voracious reader with an independent outlook and a talent for intrigue.<br>
<br>At the end of 1854, or possibly in March 1855, (Pierre) &Eacute;mile L'Angelier (<i>b</i>. 1826?) procured an introduction to her in a Glasgow street. He was a Frenchman who had risen from recent destitution to respectability as a packing clerk in a Glasgow merchant house. This outwardly personable, if volatile, young man was vain of his success with women and hoped to raise his station in life by marriage into the moneyed classes. In 1852 he had made suicidal gestures after being jilted by a prosperous woman. L'Angelier reached an understanding with Madeleine Smith by April 1855. Romantic and self-dramatizing, they maintained a constant, clandestine correspondence (in her case written with perfumed inks) and became secretly engaged. She attempted to break with him in the summer, but L'Angelier responded with sanctimonious reproaches and gently implied that he might send her letters (which she had asked him to burn) to her father. The latter refused consent to their marriage in September 1855. During the winter their surreptitious assignations resumed. Probably on 6 May (possibly 6 June) 1856 they became lovers in the woods at Rowaleyn, her father's country house near Helensburgh. &#145;If we did wrong last night it must have been in the excitement of our love&#146;, she wrote exultantly next day. &#145;Tell me, pet, were you angry at me for allowing you to do what you did&#151;was it very bad of me. &hellip; I suppose we ought to have waited until we were married&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trial of Madeleine Smith &hellip; for Poisoning</span>, 96). &#145;My dearest and beloved wife Mimi&#146;, L'Angelier replied with characteristically joyless ingratitude,<blockquote>Since I saw you I have been wretchedly sad. &hellip; Why, Mimi, did you give way after your promises? &hellip; I do not understand, my pet, your not bleeding, for every woman having her virginity must bleed. &hellip; Be sure and tell me immediately you are ill next time and if at your regular period. (Wilson, 77)</blockquote>Later in 1856 Smith's passion cooled, and on 28 January 1857 she privately accepted a proposal of marriage from a prosperous neighbour, William Harper Minnoch. When in February she broke with L'Angelier he refused to return her letters, which he threatened to give her father. Foreseeing her irredeemable ruin she implored L'Angelier not to disgrace her, and contrived a reconciliation. Near the end of that month he was taken ill with a severe stomach upset but recovered after a few days. On 12 March she agreed to marry Minnoch in June; on 6, 18, and 19 March she bought arsenic (telling the chemists variously that it was to kill rats or for use as a face wash); she invited L'Angelier to her house on 21 March (afterwards denying that they actually met), and on 23 March he died. Her letters were soon discovered in L'Angelier's office and lodgings, and his body, when exhumed on 31 March, was found to contain eighty-eight grains of arsenic; she was taken into custody.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1857 Smith's trial opened at the high court of the judiciary in Edinburgh. James, first Baron Moncrieff, who prosecuted her, contended that on three nights she had invited L'Angelier to her father's house at 7 Blythswood Square, Glasgow, and handed drinks of poisoned cocoa or coffee to him from her bedroom window so as to prevent exposure of her transgressions and to extricate herself from a disastrous entanglement. Moncrieff declared the story of her intrigue with L'Angelier &#145;should carry a chill of horror into every family&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trial of Madeleine Smith &hellip; for Poisoning</span>, 132&#150;3). The correspondence read in court, he said, disclosed &#145;almost incredible evidences of disgrace, of sin, of degradation&#146;  (ibid., 128). Certainly the assumptions of the Victorian paterfamilias were brutally affronted by the revelations of her trial, which created a national sensation. Her candid sexual pleasure and deception of her father seemed equally depraved. John Hope, the lord justice clerk, typically condemned the &#145;ill-regulated, disorderly, distempered, licentious feeling&#146; of her letters and likened her to &#145;a common prostitute&#146;  (Smith, 272&#150;3). Though at times the language of her prosecutors suggests that she was on trial for her virginity, or that she must be punished for her sexual independence, there was indubitably a case for her to answer once arsenic was discovered in L'Angelier's corpse and her efforts to buy it were traced. Smith was superbly defended by John Inglis. He contended that L'Angelier had destroyed himself either deliberately (citing some loose talk of suicide) or accidentally, for L'Angelier was a hypochondriac with a tendency to rash self-medication. Though Smith's situation between her affianced and discarded lovers was desperate, Inglis denied her motive to kill, for there was no advantage in L'Angelier's death as long as her incriminating letters were unretrieved and liable to the exposure which she dreaded. Hope's concluding address indicated that though there could be strong presumptions of guilt, at crucial points the prosecution's case was &#145;radically defective in evidence&#146; so that &#145;the guilt could not be brought home to her&#146;  (Smith, 254, 271). There was no proof of their meetings (because L'Angelier's appointment book was ruled inadmissible as evidence) and therefore no proof of the administration of poison. On 9 July 1857 the jury returned a majority verdict of not guilty on the charge of feloniously administering poison with intent to murder on 19&#150;20 February, a verdict of not proven on a similar charge of administering poison on 22&#150;3 February, and a majority verdict (13 to 2) of not proven on the third charge of murder on 22&#150;3 March.<br>
<br>Smith was firm, calm, and self-possessed during her ordeal. On 4 July 1861 she married George Young Wardle (1836&#150;1910) (son of Hugh Wardle, druggist), artist and student of medieval art, afterwards foreman-manager of William Morris. They had one son and one daughter. She became a socialist and was treasurer of the Socialist League's Bloomsbury branch from its foundation in 1885. After George Wardle's death she emigrated to the United States where she reportedly married a man called Sheehy, who died in 1926. At the age of ninety she was threatened with deportation as an undesirable alien. She died on 12 April 1928 at 4298 Park Avenue, Bronx, New York, and was buried as Lena Wardle Sheehy in Mount Hope cemetery, New York. She is the subject of Emma Robinson's novel <span class="italic">Madeleine Graham</span> (1864).<br>
