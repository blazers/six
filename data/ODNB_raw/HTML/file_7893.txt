<span class="headword">Douglas,  James</span>, fourth earl of Morton  (<em>c.</em>1516&#150;1581), <span class="occ">regent and chancellor of Scotland</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7885/', "Sir George Douglas, master of Angus (1490?&#150;1552)")</script>, of Pittendreich, near Elgin, Moray, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1560), only daughter of David Douglas, also of Pittendreich. <h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Details of Douglas's early life are sketchy. The quarrel of his paternal uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7866/', "Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus")</script>, with James V in 1528 forced some of the family, including his father, into exile in England. Whether James Douglas accompanied them is uncertain, and he is described by David Hume of Godscroft, the family biographer, as having spent the rest of James V's reign sheltering from the crown on the estates of his cousin Douglas of Glenbervie. On the other hand, the existence of a charter from 1536 which names James Douglas as heir to his mother suggests that he spent this period comparatively undisturbed on the Douglas lands at Pittendreich. It was claimed, however, that his education suffered from neglect. Between 18 March and 22 April 1543 Douglas married Lady Elizabeth Douglas (<i>d</i>. in or after 1581), youngest daughter of James Douglas, third earl of Morton (<i>d</i>. 1548), and Catherine Stewart (<i>d</i>. in or after 1554), illegitimate daughter of James IV. As part of the marriage settlement Douglas became heir to the earldom of Morton; until his father-in-law's death he was known as master of Morton. He and his wife were childless, but according to Hume he had four natural sons. Only two of them, Archibald and James, played any part in his career. <br>
<br>In the 1540s Morton's actions were largely dictated by his father and his uncle. As a result of the former's allegiance to Henry VIII as a diplomat and border official while in England, Morton and his elder brother, David, were drawn into collaboration with the earl of Hertford when in 1544 he invaded Scotland on behalf of Henry, frustrated at the pro-French policies of the Arran administration. However, in 1548 pensions to the Douglases from Henri II persuaded the family to support France. The outcome was Morton's defence of Dalkeith against the forces of Lord Gray, in the process of which he was not only &#145;sore hurt in the thigh&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1.118) but also taken as a prisoner to the Tower of London. Following his father-in-law's death, which probably occurred in December 1548, he succeeded as fourth earl of Morton; he was certainly using the title by mid-1550, on his release from captivity and return to Scotland. <br>
<br>On 14 October 1552 Morton became a privy councillor in Arran's government. His rise to prominence was assisted when, following the death of his brother David in 1557, he became the tutor or guardian of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7868/', "Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus (c.1555&#150;1588)")</script>. During Archibald's minority Morton administered on his behalf the regality of Bothwell, Tantallon Castle, Jedburgh Forest, and various other Douglas possessions in the borders. This role brought Morton considerable financial benefits. <br>
<br>With the onset of the Reformation, Morton pursued what can only be described as an equivocal policy. Certainly in 1557 he was one of those who signed the &#145;first band&#146;, a declaration protesting allegiance to the reformed faith, but thereafter his behaviour vacillated so much that John Knox was led to comment that he &#145;promised to be ours but never did plainly join&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Knox's History of the Reformation in Scotland</span>, ed. W. C. Dickinson, 2 vols., 1949, 1.261&#150;2). However, once English support for the lords of the congregation was guaranteed through the treaty of Berwick, which Morton helped to ratify in May 1560, he backed the reformers wholeheartedly and was a signatory of the first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> in January 1561. <h2>
<a name="Politicianandcourtier15611572"></a>Politician and courtier, 1561&#150;1572</h2>The start of Mary's personal rule marked the emergence of Morton as a leading figure on the Scottish political scene, and later in 1561 he actively assisted the earl of Moray in his restoration of law and order in the borders. In the following year he played a prominent role in the campaign against the rebellious earl of Huntly. His reward in 1563 was to become chancellor, the key post in the administrative system. In 1565 he gave his approval to the proposed marriage between Mary and Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, though his decision to do so was probably greatly influenced by the eventual agreement of the bridegroom's mother, Margaret Stewart, countess of Lennox, to renounce any claims to the inheritance of Morton's nephew, the earl of Angus. <br>
<br>However, the queen's marriage was undoubtedly a turning point in Morton's relations with her. Although in August 1565 Morton helped Mary to suppress the chaseabout raid, the earl of Moray's ill-advised attempt at rebellion, a few months later he became deeply implicated in the conspiracy against David Riccio, the queen's unpopular Italian secretary. His motive for an involvement which extended to being actually present at Riccio's murder in March 1566 may have been based on a suspicion that he was about to lose his post as chancellor; but it is much more likely that Morton saw an opportunity to win the favour of Darnley, who hated Riccio, and in association with Morton create a situation where the queen's husband became a mere figurehead in a government dominated by the two powerful noblemen. Whatever his motivation, the upshot for Morton was the loss of his chancellorship and another period of exile in England. This lasted until December 1566 when, being granted a remission for his complicity in the Riccio affair, he arrived back in Edinburgh shortly before the next violent episode in Mary's reign, the Darnley murder. Morton's part in the mysterious events at Kirk o' Field remains uncertain, though he later insisted that while he had known about the plot he had not personally participated in the events. <br>
<br>Thereafter, Morton initially supported Bothwell, being a signatory of the Ainslie bond in which several noblemen agreed to the proposition that Bothwell should marry the queen. However, like most of the nobility Morton quickly changed his attitude once the wedding took place, and he became a prominent member of the party in revolt against Mary and her new husband. He was consequently at Carberry, where the queen surrendered, though not before Bothwell had challenged him to a duel to settle outstanding issues between the two of them. Perhaps fortunately, considering Morton's age, Mary intervened and refused to countenance such a contest. <br>
<br>Mary's abdication marked another significant stage in the fourth earl's career. On 29 July 1567 Morton took the coronation oath on behalf of the infant James VI; at the same time he became a member of the council in charge of the country until the earl of Moray returned from France; in December he was reappointed chancellor. During Moray's regency he remained a key figure, commanding the vanguard at the battle of Langside in May 1568 and later acting as a commissioner for the king's party at the inquiry into Mary's conduct organized at York by Elizabeth I. Moreover, it was Morton who possessed what he claimed was incriminating evidence against Mary, namely, the casket letters. These &#145;lettrez, missives, contractis sonnettis and utheris writles&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 2.730) had, he said, been discovered by his agents eighteen months before, inside a box in a house in Edinburgh. <br>
<br>In some ways Moray's assassination in January 1570 might seem to have been an appropriate occasion for Morton to seize control of the country. Yet he supported the claims of the earl of Lennox for the regency, acting in this fashion because, presumably, he judged the time inappropriate and the queen's party still in a strong position. In fact it was another year before Mary's most significant supporters, including Argyll, Eglinton, and Cassillis, forsook her. Again, in September 1571, when Lennox was killed at Stirling, Morton hesitated to contest the succession as regent of the earl of Mar, and it was not until the latter's sudden death in October 1572 that he felt absolutely convinced that his moment had arrived. Finally on 24 November 1572 at a convention of the Scottish estates in Edinburgh Morton was elected regent &#145;be pluralitie of votes of the saidis estaittis&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.242&#150;3). <h2>
<a name="Relationswiththenobility"></a>Relations with the nobility</h2>Although on 12 January 1573 Morton placated one of his most powerful antagonists, Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll, by appointing him chancellor, he still faced internal opposition. First, certain members of the nobility were against him&#151;the Gordons, Hamiltons, and Setons, linked with the earl of Atholl; second, under Kirkcaldy of Grange's command within the strategically important Edinburgh Castle, there were such diehard Marians as Lord Home and Maitland of Lethington. To some extent the hostility of the former proved to be the lesser problem. With the considerable assistance of the English ambassador, Henry Killigrew, in February 1573 the agreement known as the pacification of Perth was reached with the Gordons and Hamiltons. In return for ending their allegiance to Mary, promising religious conformity, and recognizing the regent's authority, the two families were given an amnesty for their previous actions and much of their forfeited property was restored. When the earl of Atholl submitted separately in April, Morton's outstanding difficulties with the nobility were over. <br>
<br>The struggle against the so-called Castilians lasted a bit longer, largely because Grange and the others, convinced that the fortress was impregnable, rejected Morton's attempts at mediation. Morton did not possess the military strength to capture the castle. Consequently it was not until May, when the English government provided the requisite artillery firepower, that Grange and his associates were eventually forced to agree to an unconditional surrender. <br>
<br>For nearly five years thereafter, with an administration largely dominated by his relatives and trusted supporters, Morton ruled Scotland on James VI's behalf. For much of the time he experienced little serious opposition from the nobility. Unquestionably there were the occasional problems: George Gordon, fifth earl of Huntly (<i>d</i>. 1576), and his exiled brother, Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, the Perth settlement notwithstanding, were still restless and disaffected. Morton countered this threat by placing the earl under house arrest in the south of Scotland and undertaking a punitive expedition to Gordon territory in the north-east in August 1574. Again, a dispute with Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll, who had succeeded his brother the chancellor on the latter's sudden death in September 1573, was resolved in the regent's favour. At issue here were certain royal jewels retained by Argyll's wife, the earl of Moray's widow, which Morton insisted must be restored to the crown. However, in his handling of the feud which developed in 1576 between Argyll and John Stewart, twenty-third earl of Atholl, Morton was much less successful. In this instance disagreements between the earls over rights of jurisdiction with their respective territories escalated into a bitter wrangle which created widespread disorder between their followers. The regent attempted to tackle the situation by summoning both noblemen before the privy council, denouncing their actions, and demanding an end to the disturbances. But all he achieved was a hardening of Argyll's resolve and the disillusionment of Atholl, who became convinced that Morton had not done enough on his behalf. <br>
<br>Whether Morton might have dealt with this affair more effectively and thus forestalled the coup against him in 1578 is a moot point. Certainly the outcome was unfortunate for him since it resulted in Atholl's retaliating by aligning himself with his recent enemy, Argyll. Furthermore, the two earls were a formidable coalition since they also had a crucial ally in Sir Alexander Erskine, the king's guardian, who was only too willing to give the regent's opponents access to James VI. The upshot was that they persuaded the twelve-year-old monarch to summon a convention at Stirling in March 1578 for the express purpose of ending Morton's regency. Sensing a <i>fait accompli</i>, the latter meekly offered his resignation, and after handing over Edinburgh Castle to the new regime he retired from the scene to contemplate events; a letter written at this time gave his age as sixty-one. <br>
<br>In temporary retirement Morton must have reflected on how he had been outmanoeuvred by Argyll and Atholl, not to mention all those other noblemen who joined their faction. Included among these were the earl of Montrose, at odds with the regent over a disputed charter; the earl of Eglinton, aggrieved at being imprisoned for offences against the Hamiltons; Lord Maxwell, displeased at his dismissal as warden of the west march; Lord Herries, Maxwell's uncle, who sympathized with his nephew; and Lord Ogilvie, an incorrigible Marian who had also been imprisoned by Morton. The latter must also have realized how his opponents exploited his failure to devote sufficient attention to James VI who, at such an impressionable age, could easily be manipulated by older men. The former regent in his turn used this lever to recover his former position. Within three months he had himself restored to his previous status in all but title, by deploying the influence of the youthful earl of Mar over the king (at the end of April 1578 Mar had displaced his uncle, Sir Alexander Erskine, as the royal guardian). Although Morton subsequently denied any involvement in this change of personnel it certainly suited his purposes. In no time he was conducting negotiations with his former enemies and at a convention held at Stirling on 12 June 1578 persuaded a majority of those present that he should not only be restored to the privy council but should also have &#145;first rowme and place&#146; on that body  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 5.296). <br>
<br>However Morton's troubles were not quite over. That summer the Argyll&#150;Atholl faction rallied to challenge him, and by August matters had come to such a head that civil war seemed imminent as the supporters of the rival parties faced each other at Falkirk. But wiser counsels prevailed, and largely through the intervention of the English ambassador, Robert Bowes, a settlement was reached which satisfied both sides. Further conciliatory meetings over the next few months tended to confirm that at least for the present Morton's position was reasonably secure. Morton, who had survived his most recent crisis by granting some of his rivals greater access to the king and admitting others to the privy council, was undoubtedly aware that he must tread warily in the future. Consequently he was attracted to a diversion which would prevent, as Hume of Godscroft put it, his opponents having &#145;leisure to think of him and his late greatness&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the House of Douglas</span>, 2.262). The stratagem of launching an attack on the Hamiltons early in 1579 was not only diversionary but also a popular move against a family with considerable financial assets. On the grounds that the terms of the pacification of Perth were no longer in force, on 1 May the Hamiltons were proscribed. Lords John and Claud escaped to France but their deranged brother, the earl of Arran, and his mother, the duchess of Ch&acirc;telherault, were seized and forced to hand over the Hamilton possessions to the crown. The morality of Morton's actions against the Hamiltons is obviously questionable, and certainly Queen Elizabeth was critical of his tactics. None the less it did win favour with James VI, who was reported as saying that &#145;no nobleman's service to Scotland was to be compared to Morton's&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 5.337). <h2>
<a name="Relationswiththekirk"></a>Relations with the kirk</h2>While Morton's relations with the nobility were highly significant and the breakdown in them led ultimately to his downfall, his dealings with the kirk formed another important aspect of his administration. Here, the two main issues were the finances and the organization of the church. Morton inherited a financial system adopted in Mary's reign whereby the former members of the unreformed church retained two-thirds of their income while the remaining third was shared between the state and the new kirk. In 1567 a further change had given the latter first claim to the thirds and the right to appoint its own collectors. However, John Knox and his colleagues had neither the organizational ability nor the clout to make these concessions effective, and when Morton took over in 1572, having coincidentally become regent on the day of Knox's death, he found the collectory in a chaotic condition. <br>
<br>One of Morton's first tasks was to have the outstanding accounts audited while at the same time encouraging the clergy to collect the current thirds or duties from the members of their own parishes. To make this possible he had a new register of members compiled; one minister was responsible for three or four parishes on average. Additionally Morton revived the office of collector-general, and the state once again became responsible for the collection of the thirds. These innovations, which were introduced in 1573&#150;4, were mostly received quite favourably by members of the kirk. However, there was one outspoken critic, John Davidson, regent of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, who, before fleeing into exile, protested that &#145;Four parish kirks are over a great charge for one minister&#146;, and that &#145;the order that would appoint so many was evil and consequentlie devilish&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.314). Some of the clergy were also unhappy about lay collection of the thirds, but there is little doubt that under Morton they were far more efficiently collected and administered than hitherto. <br>
<br>The regent was less successful in the recovery of thirds which had been lost as a result of remissions and the granting of pensions, and there is little evidence that he was either very innovative or energetic enough to recover the kirk's wealth. Conversely, he certainly looked after his own family: always alert to the interests of his sons Archibald and James, he appointed the latter commendator of Pluscarden Abbey and awarded him a pension from Balmerino Abbey. Other kinsmen who benefited from his generosity with ecclesiastical revenues included Archibald Douglas, senator of the college of justice; William Douglas, commendator of Melrose Abbey; and George Douglas, bishop of Moray. However, it was the polity or constitution of the reformed church that gradually became the key issue dominating Morton's relations with its members, particularly in the later stages of his career. In 1571, before he became regent, Morton had his first taste of clerical opposition over the question of the appointment of bishops to the church and, in particular, that of his elderly kinsman John Douglas as archbishop of St Andrews. A conference at Leith in January 1572 seemed to resolve this at least for the time being, since the kirk's leaders agreed to a settlement whereby the government would continue to appoint bishops, but the latter would require the approval of the chapter concerned and also be subject to the discipline of the general assembly. It was not until 1574 with the return from Switzerland of the more radically inclined Andrew Melville and his appointment as principal of Glasgow University that the kirk acquired a leader prepared to challenge the regent and that Morton found himself under increasing pressure from the church. As it happened, it took Melville and his colleagues until 1578 to reach a position to seek approval from Morton's government of their revised blueprint for the reformed church, the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>. While it reiterated many of the proposals of the first book, there were undoubtedly a number of controversial aspects within it. The reformed kirk now sought to obtain all the revenues of the old one, to abolish bishops altogether, and to seek acceptance of the so-called doctrine of the &#145;two kingdoms&#146;, whereby the church had sole control of ecclesiastical matters. <br>
<br>To Morton, who was strongly convinced that the church should be subordinate to the state, the proposed reforms were totally unacceptable. However, faced with the political instability which existed between 1578 and 1580, he had to proceed cautiously and avoid antagonizing the Melvillian party too much, since the latter, as he discovered, were quite prepared to make difficulties for him by fraternizing with his adversaries. Therefore Morton's strategy was to procrastinate; conferences were held and committees were duly appointed. When the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> was presented in June 1578 Morton told the kirk's commissioners that &#145;the said buik bein red and considerit &hellip; and mony headis thairof being found of so great wecht and consequence &hellip; na resolution nor determination can be presentlie gevin thairin&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 3.105). The final result was little different. <h2>
<a name="Thebordersandotherdomesticmatters"></a>The borders and other domestic matters</h2>The governmental system which Morton took over in 1572 was one in which the central authorities depended largely on the local wardens to impose law and order on their respective territories. These comprised three areas known as the east, west, and middle marches, with in addition Liddesdale&#151;technically part of the middle march but often assigned a separate keeper. While the virtually hereditary nature of the positions gave Morton little choice in selecting the wardens, his appointments nevertheless performed competently. On the east march between 1573 and 1578 Hume of Coldenknowes carried out his duties effectively as did his replacement, Hume of Wedderburn, between 1578 and 1580. Similarly, Morton had little to complain of in the efforts of Ker of Cessford and John Carmichael of that ilk on the middle march and Liddesdale respectively. But the situation was somewhat different on the west march, where Lord Maxwell's quirky personality (a characteristic also of the other wardens) proved too much for the regent, who in 1577 had him replaced by his nephew the earl of Angus. After the upheaval of 1578 the west march became more unstable; first Maxwell and then his uncle Lord Herries were in charge, until, perhaps unwisely, Morton appointed their great family rival, John Johnstone of that ilk. <br>
<br>In the administration of the borders there were occasions when Morton reinforced the power of the wardens by attending in person. For instance, eight judicial and military raids on various parts of the frontier were planned between 1573 and 1578, of which six were implemented. Morton was present on all of these. Again, in 1574&#150;5 he gave instructions for a detachment of 100 infantrymen and forty light horsemen to carry out operations in Liddesdale and the middle march, a tactic repeated at the suggestion of Lord Herries in 1579. Finally, the system of taking pledges was tightened up. The prevalent practice, which had been subject to various forms of abuse, was that prominent borderers, as a guarantee for the good behaviour of their family or dependants, were placed in a form of mild detention remote from their homes. Morton now insisted that any keeper who allowed a pledge to escape would be subject to a statutory fine of &pound;2000. <br>
<br>Lawlessness and disorder in other parts of Scotland also received Morton's attention. An expedition to the north-east in 1574 was aimed both at the suppression of the troublesome Gordon family and at &#145;the establishment of justice and punishment of disordouris and enormittis attemptit aganis our Soverane lordis authoritie and commonweill of the realme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 2.388). Undoubtedly there were still numerous turbulent outbreaks in various parts of the country, notably the Black Isle, where the Mackenzies of Kintail were the offenders. None the less, there seems good ground for believing the verdict of the Edinburgh burgess, Robert Birrell, that, overall, Morton &#145;kept the country in great justice and peace&#146;  (Dalyell, 21). <br>
<br>The other main aspect of Morton's domestic administration was his supervision of the country's finances. Commendable efforts were made to obtain the outstanding revenues from the crown lands and customs. In addition Campveere in the Netherlands was at last established as the staple port for Scottish merchants. To some extent Morton's actions eased the financial position of the comptroller, William Murray of Tullibardine, yet escalating commodity prices ensured there was still a huge deficit in his department. In the context of rampant inflation the treasurer, Lord Ruthven, was faced with the expenses of the civil war (including the rebuilding of Edinburgh Castle with its famous half-moon battery) and of dealing with the unrest of 1578 and the Hamilton vendetta the following year. In response to constant financial difficulties Morton drew on his personal wealth and made regular loans to the treasury. He then recovered the debt from the profits which he made by manipulating the currency, an amount described by one modern commentator as &#145;unquantifiable&#146;  (Lynch, 227). <br>
<br>However, while debasement was a fairly common measure in the sixteenth century it was inflationary and in the long term did little to improve the situation or enhance the regent's popularity with his subjects. Other expedients adopted by Morton included the placing of an embargo on the export of silver, a request to the convention of royal burghs for a subsidy, and, in an attempt to tackle the shortage of bullion, encouragement of attempts at gold and silver mining. Notwithstanding Morton's efforts, both financial departments registered continuing and substantial deficits. <h2>
<a name="AngloScottishrelations"></a>Anglo-Scottish relations</h2>France still exercised some influence in Scottish affairs, especially at the beginning of Morton's regency, and there was a certain amount of diplomatic activity with Sweden and the Netherlands over the recruitment of Scottish mercenaries. Relations with England unquestionably dominated Morton's foreign policy, however, and Elizabeth and her government welcomed his appointment, correctly anticipating that the regent would continue to display those Anglophile tendencies which had been a feature of his earlier career. Morton's immediate task was to convince the English government of the necessity of providing support for his efforts at overcoming the resistance of the Castilians, backed as they were by France and actively seeking the latter's intervention on their behalf. Military and financial aid was crucial if the regent was ever to capture Edinburgh Castle, but fortunately for Morton both Lord Burghley and Sir Francis Walsingham appreciated his problems and supported his appeals to Queen Elizabeth for assistance. In April 1573, following the breakdown of further attempts at persuading the garrison to surrender, an alliance was signed between Morton's government and England. The unconditional surrender of the castle in May brought an end to the first chapter of Morton's relations with England. The last serious threat to the regent's authority had been removed, while the collapse of the Marian faction was popular in England and advantageous to Elizabeth. <br>
<br>Thereafter, until his deposition in March 1578, the main feature of Morton's policy towards England was his attempt to persuade Elizabeth and her ministers to conclude a defensive pact with their neighbour. What the regent envisaged was an alliance in which both sides would give guarantees to defend the protestant cause, while at the same time promising mutual assistance in the event of a foreign attack. However, Morton's efforts were doomed to failure. In the 1570s Elizabeth experienced few serious threats from either France or Spain, and since there was little likelihood of Scotland being used as a base for attacking England she was not interested in Morton's proposition. Quite clearly she regarded Scotland as a minor power and treated its regent accordingly. In 1575 Morton required all his diplomatic skill to defuse the Redeswyre crisis, which arose when an English warden was killed in a border incident and Elizabeth furiously overreacted. <br>
<br>None the less, when he recovered his position later in 1578, Elizabeth was not prepared to forsake Morton in his subsequent struggles with his opponents. During the threat from the Argyll&#150;Atholl faction that summer he could take some reassurance from the knowledge that English forces were poised at Berwick to swoop, if necessary, on his border adversaries. Again in August 1578 it was largely through the diplomacy of Robert Bowes, the English ambassador, that a possible civil war was averted and Morton's position secured. The final occasion when there was a flurry of activity in Anglo-Scottish relations occurred late in 1579, when Esm&eacute; Stewart, a kinsman of James VI, arrived from France. His influence with the impressionable young king (who created him earl of Lennox in April 1580), combined with his political connections, supposedly with both France and Spain, caused concern not only to Morton but also to Elizabeth. But embroiled as she was in negotiations for a possible marriage to the duc d'Alen&ccedil;on, the queen vacillated between sending modest subsidies to the Scottish government and ignoring Morton altogether. As Lennox tightened his grip on the country and gathered increasing support, Morton was left to reflect on the ineffectual nature of his partnership with England. Once Elizabeth perceived that the threat posed by Lennox was much less serious than originally imagined, she was prepared more or less to abandon her ally. Her reluctance to commit herself to Morton's cause was to have even more damaging consequences for him when he was finally overthrown by his enemies. <h2>
<a name="Downfall"></a>Downfall</h2>In the course of a year Lennox had become the focus for all those who for one reason or another wished to end Morton's regime. Many of them were members of that group of Morton's opponents of the summer of 1578 referred to by Robert Bowes, the English ambassador, as the &#145;Fellowship of Falkirk&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 5.378). The earl of Atholl had died in controversial circumstances in April 1579 amid allegations that he had been poisoned on Morton's instructions, but there were others who by this juncture had aligned themselves to the Lennox bandwagon, notably William Ruthven, Lord Ruthven, the treasurer, and Robert Pitcairn, commendator of Dunfermline and royal secretary, as well as a new star on the political horizon, Captain James Stewart. After his return from military service abroad Stewart, who was the second son of Lord Ochiltree, enjoyed a meteoric rise in the favour of both Lennox and James VI, who eventually elevated him to the earldom of Arran. It was Stewart who, at a meeting of the privy council on 31 December 1580 attended by the king, suddenly accused Morton of being an accessory to the murder of Lord Darnley. Following Morton's furious denial of the charge, the royal advocate, David Borthwick of Lochhill, recommended that the regent should be placed in custody pending his trial. Morton's political career ended; he was briefly imprisoned in Holyrood Palace and then in Edinburgh Castle before being transferred to Dumbarton, a fortress which was deep in Lennox territory, and chosen, according to the English ambassador, because the privy council was worried about &#145;what practices his friends would use either to give him intelligence or to carry him away&#146;  (ibid., 5.580). <br>
<br>These fears were not groundless, since during the early part of 1581 Morton's followers attempted to rally support for him. Morton's principal agent was his nephew the earl of Angus, who at one point in February even contemplated attacking Dumbarton Castle. But in the end Angus found himself outmanoeuvred. The backing for the Lennox administration was too widespread, and it outflanked him by arresting his relatives Archibald Douglas, senator of the college of justice, William Douglas of Whittinghame, George Auchinleck of Balmanno, and William Hume of Spot, and by exiling his sons Archibald and James and his kinsmen John Carmichael of that ilk, Malcolm Douglas of Mains, and William Douglas of Lochleven. While the sympathies of Elizabeth and her ministers tended to lie with the former regent, they pursued a realistic foreign policy. Elizabeth instructed Lord Hunsdon, governor of Berwick, to raise troops for possible action on the borders, and her ambassador Thomas Randolph condemned the Lennox administration in front of the Scottish estates. Ultimately, however, the English government placed its own interests first. Consequently, when Elizabeth reflected upon the growing threat from Spain, the actual cost of intervention in Scottish affairs, and the poor condition of her border levies, it made sounder political sense to abandon Morton and concentrate on the maintenance of friendly relations with France. <br>
<br>By April 1581 support for Morton within Scotland had dwindled even further: on 8 April his cousin, Douglas of Lochleven, was instructed to go into exile &#145;beyond the wattir of Cromartie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Registrum honoris de Morton</span>, 1.127); and on 22 April John Johnstone of that ilk, one of his main allies in the borders, lost his wardenship of the west march to Lord Maxwell, one of Lennox's adherents. The same month, as a result of pressure from his uncle Alexander Erskine, the earl of Mar abandoned Angus and handed over the strategically important Stirling Castle to the government. Shortly afterwards Angus, recognizing the inevitable, prepared with the remnant of his followers to seek refuge in England. <br>
<br>At this stage, confident that the opposition had been nullified, Lennox began to set in motion the arrangements for Morton's trial. On 23 May Morton was taken from Dumbarton to Edinburgh. Initially he faced a lengthy list of charges ranging from supporting Bothwell at the time of his marriage to Mary, committing various currency offences, plotting the removal of the master of Mar as royal guardian, conspiring to seize James VI in April 1580, and accepting English pensions, to the crucial charge of being implicated in the murder of Darnley. Significantly, there was no mention of the poisoning of the earl of Atholl; this suggests that his opponents, despite their efforts, had still insufficient evidence to offer against him. None the less, there was considerable substance to many of these accusations. For example, like numerous others Morton had briefly supported Bothwell; quite likely he was guilty of certain malpractices relating to the treasury; he may well have plotted the overthrow of Lennox and the seizure of the king; undoubtedly he pursued an Anglophile foreign policy and received some financial aid from England. <br>
<br>Finally, however, the Lennox administration decided that it would merely accuse Morton of complicity in the murder of Darnley and that it would ignore all the other charges. This was a wise move considering the delay which might well have ensued in hearing nearly twenty charges, not to mention the embarrassment for some prominent figures which would have ensued from the raking up of the past. It remained only for Lennox to guarantee the verdict he wanted; hence the selection of a jury almost totally antagonistic to Morton. Obvious candidates were old foes such as the earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Montrose, and lords Maxwell and Seton. Others with grievances against the former regent were the earl of Sutherland, a kinsman of Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, Lord Ogilvie (whom Morton had imprisoned between 1576 and 1578), Sir Patrick Learmonth of Dairsie, and Hepburn of Waughton. The last two were closely connected to Kirkcaldy of Grange, whose execution had been ordered by Morton after the fall of Edinburgh Castle in 1573. Lord Innermeath, the master of Livingston, and Sir William Livingston too were linked one way or another to the Lennox faction. Only the earls of Eglinton and Rothes with Lord Somerville could be regarded as in any way impartial. With such a jury the odds were stacked against Morton. <br>
<br>After a brief hearing, the outcome of which was a foregone conclusion, on 1 June 1581 the earl of Montrose, on behalf of the jury, pronounced the accused guilty of &#145;airt, pairt, foir knowledge and conceling of the tresonable and unnatural murthow foirsaid&#146;  (Pitcairn, 1.114). The next morning, Friday 2 June, Morton had a lengthy discussion with some of the leading members of the kirk. Two of the churchmen present, Walter Balconquhall and John Durie, subsequently recorded the conversations which have become known as Morton's &#145;confession&#146;. In fact it hardly merited this description since it was mainly a refutation of all the previous allegations, including a denial of any knowledge of the poisoning of Atholl. Morton conceded that he might have been &#145;a filthie abusare of my body in the pleasures of the flesh&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.574); yet, he insisted, he had always put the interests of the kirk at the forefront of his considerations. This questionable statement was followed by a final warning to the clergy: the king was surrounded by those &#145;knowin to he papistis&#146; and &#145;the estait of the religion in this country appeired never to be in sic danger&#146;  (ibid., 575). About 2 o'clock that afternoon Morton had his last meal. Two hours later he was executed at the cross, Edinburgh, by the &#145;maiden&#146;, an instrument similar to the guillotine which he himself had allegedly introduced into Scotland from England. That evening his body was buried in Greyfriars churchyard. <br>
<br>It seems clear that the Lennox administration eliminated Morton because it feared a possible repetition of his performance of 1578 and recovery of his position for a third time. Equally, there was the attraction of the various spoils attendant on the downfall of the Douglases. Not surprisingly Lennox and Arran did particularly well; the former acquired, among other rewards, the lordship, regality, and barony of Dalkeith and the baronies of Aberdour, Mordington, and Whittinghame; the latter obtained a substantial pension from Balmerino Abbey, formerly in the hands of Morton's natural son James, and a lease of the lead mines previously belonging to Morton's cousin George Douglas of Parkhead. Other members of the Stewart family were also handsomely rewarded, as were their close allies, especially John Maxwell, Lord Maxwell, who was created earl of Morton only three days after the execution. This particular victory was short-lived, however. Morton's attainder was reversed on 29 January 1586, and the earldom reverted to his heir of entail, his nephew the earl of Angus. Morton's wife survived him, but on 12 July 1581 a jury pronounced that she had been insane for twenty-two years. <br>
<br>Morton's political performance must be regarded as uneven. He handled the turbulent nobility quite skilfully for much of the time, yet he failed to prevent the Argyll&#150;Atholl partnership from undermining his position in 1578 and, even more crucially, to take decisive action against the partnership of Lennox and Captain James Stewart in 1580. The attack on the Hamiltons the previous year was a questionable stratagem. However, Morton was comparatively old when he took office in 1572 and by 1579 he was complaining of both his &#145;grit aige&#146; and his &#145;disesis and infirmiteis&#146;  (Livingstone and others, 7.2093), so it is quite possible that his enthusiasm for day-to-day government waned while his judgments became less perceptive. The vexed question of the institution of the kirk was still very much unresolved at his downfall. Since, like the king, he had little time for the policies of Andrew Melville and the radical wing of the kirk, it seems unlikely that the favourable opinion held of him by certain presbyterian authors at the time of his death would have endured had he remained in power. In domestic affairs his administration of the borders displayed all the signs of an efficient regime, at least until the crisis of 1578. Elsewhere, despite his efforts, he was ultimately unable to prevent rising deficits occurring within the exchequer office. Moreover, his manipulation of the currency and certain other questionable practices gave rise to probably justifiable allegations that he &#145;was inclined to covetousness&#146;  (Spottiswoode, 2.197). <br>
<br>Undoubtedly Morton was not a paragon of virtue in either public or private life. Nevertheless he did have one outstanding characteristic, a powerful personality. Consequently, he was the best individual available to administer Scotland during James VI's minority and for eight years gave the country a relatively strong and effective government. In the circumstances prevailing, this was a commendable achievement and one for which Morton should be principally remembered.<br>
