<span class="headword">Hodgson,  William</span>  (1763/4?&#150;1851), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was descended from an &#145;ancient border family&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), and in early life studied medicine in the Netherlands, where he developed an interest in botany. On his return to England he attended with success, through a severe illness, a member of Lord Holland's family, but he declined Lord Holland's offer of an appointment. He adopted extreme political views, chiefly derived from the French philosophers, and Benjamin Franklin and Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var were among his warmest friends. Hodgson was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42297/', "London Corresponding Society")</script>. On 9 December 1793 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of having proposed as a toast &#145;the French republic&#146;, and of having &#145;compared the king to a German hog butcher&#146;. He was found guilty and was sentenced to be confined in Newgate for two years, to pay a fine of &pound;200, and to find securities of &pound;400 for a further two years. In the Newgate criminal register, dated 1 September 1794, his age was given as thirty. While incarcerated he wrote his best-known work, <span class="italic">The Commonwealth of Reason</span> (1795). After regaining his liberty Hodgson relinquished politics for literature and science, becoming an independent printer-publisher and publishing numerous works on topics such as French and English grammar, chemistry, and the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, in addition to a pamphlet on his own conviction for sedition, <span class="italic">The Case of W. Hodgson</span> (1796). He appears to have been a member of the Freethinking Christian congregation in 1810. He wrote for William Sherwin's <span class="italic">Political Register</span> in 1817. Hodgson died of bronchitis in Hemmington Terrace, Islington, London, on 2 March 1851, when according to his obituary he was said to be not 87 but 106. He had been married three times and was &#145;survived but by one son&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
