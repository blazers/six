<span class="headword">Fisher <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Slack]</span>,  Anne</span>  (1719&#150;1778), <span class="occ">writer on education</span>, was born in Oldscale, in the parish of Lorton, Cumberland, the daughter of Henry Fisher, yeoman, and was baptized in Lorton on 9 December 1719. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64284/', "Thomas Slack (bap. 1723, d. 1784)")</script>, printer of Newcastle, on 15 December 1751.<br>
<br>Anne Fisher compiled several schoolbooks; the earliest noted by Alston is the second edition of <span class="italic">A New Grammar: being the Most Easy Guide to Speaking and Writing the English Language Properly and Correctly</span>, which was printed and published in Newcastle in 1750 by Isaac Thompson, her future husband's employer. Her other works include <span class="italic">The Pleasing Instructor, or, Entertaining Moralist &hellip; to which are Prefixed, New Thoughts on Education</span> (1756); <span class="italic">The New English Tutor, or, Modern Preceptor</span> (1763?); <span class="italic">A New English Exercise Book, calculated to Render the Construction of the English Tongue Easy and Familiar</span> (1770); and <span class="italic">An Accurate New Spelling Dictionary, and Expositor of the English Language</span> (2nd edn, 1773). These popular books were frequently reprinted and pirated in the later years of the eighteenth and early years of the nineteenth centuries.<br>
<br>Anne Fisher was no mere compiler; she wrote as an experienced educator. Her comments on the teaching of English grammar in the preface of her <span class="italic">New Grammar</span> continue to be pertinent and there is a modern ring, too, to her remark, in the introduction to her <span class="italic">Pleasing Instructor</span>, that:<blockquote>An austere or learned pedant has sometimes <i>whipped Latin, Greek</i>, &amp;c. into a lad, whose very disgust to <i>it</i> increased, perhaps, with the Acquisition thereof; but it is a <i>manifest</i> absurdity to maintain or imagine that <i>anyone</i> can be <i>awed</i> into a <i>Love</i> of learning. (A. Fisher, <span class="italic">The Pleasing Instructor</span>, 3rd edn, 1760, ii)</blockquote>Furthermore Ian Michael, commenting on this same work, records that &#145;Such exercises [correcting &#147;false English&#148;] were first applied to the teaching of English syntax by Ann Fisher of Newcastle&#146;  (Michael, 325), on the suggestion of an anonymous correspondent writing from Carlisle. It is likely that she supported her husband in his authorship, under the pseudonym S. Thomas, of several works of commercial instruction. She also complemented his <span class="italic">Newcastle Memorandum-Book</span> (published annually from 1756 to 1893) with her <span class="italic">Ladies' Own Memorandum-Book</span>, which was partly produced in London and which survived until 1805.<br>
<br>Over many years Anne Fisher gave encouragement and support of all kinds to John Cunningham (1729&#150;1773), poet and strolling player. The Slacks published Cunningham's pastoral poems in their newspaper, the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, and in their memorandum-books, and valued his friendship on this account. But it is clear from the published letters of Anne Fisher to Cunningham, who was feckless, that she gave him money and clothes, and tried to guide him in his expenditure of the small income produced from the publication of his collected poems. These letters also show not only that she took an active part in the management of her husband's business, especially when he was absent from Newcastle, but also that she understood the technical requirements of book production. For example, in her letter of 4 September 1771 to Cunningham in Scarborough, in which she writes in some detail about the publication of the second edition of his poems, she says: &#145;Your book is all off now, but not dry enough to bind; a month or two later of the season is the proper season for publishing you may depend of it&#146;  (Hodgson, &#145;John Cunningham&#146;, 93). She had earlier tried to persuade him to dedicate the first edition to his patron Mrs Elizabeth Montagu, the &#145;Queen of Bluestockings&#146;, who had a house near Newcastle but he insisted on dedicating and presenting two specially bound copies of the book to David Garrick, whom, as an actor, he greatly admired, but who received the gift ungraciously, giving him 2 guineas and observing that &#145;Poets and players are always poor&#146;  (ibid., 86&#150;7).<br>
<br>Anne Fisher and her husband had nine children, all girls, of whom five survived them both. She died on 25 April 1778 in Newcastle and was buried in St John's Church. After the death of Thomas Slack, on 13 January 1784, their fourth surviving daughter, Sarah, inherited the printing and bookselling business, and married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63760/', "Solomon Hodgson")</script> on 15 February 1785.<br>
