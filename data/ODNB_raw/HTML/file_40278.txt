<span class="headword">Aldred,  Guy Alfred</span>  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">anarchist and political propagandist</span>, was born on 5 November 1886 at 24 Corporation Buildings, Farringdon Road, Clerkenwell, London, the son of Arthur Alfred Aldred (<i>b</i>. 1864/5), a dramatist, and his wife, Ada Caroline Holdsworth (<i>b</i>. 1866/7). His father had deserted his family by 1892, and he was brought up by his mother, a parasol maker; his maternal grandfather, Charles William Holdsworth, a radical bookbinder, was a strong early influence. Aldred was educated in Clerkenwell at the Iron infants' school (1891&#150;3) and the Hugh Myddleton School (1893&#150;1901). After leaving school he soon became a penny-a-line journalist with the National Press Agency (1901&#150;6) and briefly with the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> (1907), before leaving to engage full-time in socialist propaganda. For the next fifty-six years, as a major figure in the British anarchist and anti-parliamentary communist movements, he wrote and published a stream of pamphlets, books, and journals, and set up a number of printing presses, from the Bakunin Press in London (1907) to the Strickland Press in Glasgow (1939&#150;68).<br>
<br>Aldred's early political career was spent in London among dissident left groups, including the Social Democratic Federation (1905&#150;6), but he soon moved towards anarchism. He quickly fell out with the Freedom group of anarchists, and set up instead his own group to promote industrial unionism and direct action. In 1908 he left his mother's home at 133 Goswell Road, London, to set up a free union with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58610/', "Rose Lillian Witcop (1890&#150;1932)")</script>, a milliner. A son, Annesley, was born in 1909. Aldred's visit to Glasgow in 1912 at the invitation of the Glasgow Clarion Scouts was a great success, and he was invited back for several speaking tours of Scotland, although these were curtailed by war. In 1916 he spent his first spell of almost continuous imprisonment as a conscientious objector. On his release (March 1919) he returned to Glasgow, his base for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Aldred now played a central part in efforts to realign the communist left on an anti-parliamentary basis, notably through the formation of the Communist League in 1919, but these foundered with the establishment in 1920 of the centralized Communist Party of Great Britain, backed by Moscow. Aldred and some remaining comrades defiantly formed the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation in 1921, based at 13 Burnbank Gardens, Glasgow (Bakunin House). By now Aldred and Witcop had separated, and he formed another free union with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54408/', "Jane Hamilton (Jenny) Patrick (1884&#150;1971)")</script>. Despite a marriage of convenience with Witcop on 2 February 1926 at Glasgow register office to thwart her threatened deportation, the union with Jenny Patrick was lifelong and, after Witcop's death on 4 July 1932, constituted a valid marriage under Scottish common law. In 1933 Aldred's resignation from the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation over the divisive ballot-box tactic forced their move to 5 Baliol Street, which was their home for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>Aldred's new organization, the United Socialist Movement, founded in 1934, marked a change in philosophy and tactics from an exclusively anti-parliamentary focus to the need for socialist unity to defeat fascism, notably through support of the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War. Street-corner meetings were held almost nightly in 1936&#150;7, accompanied, despite extreme poverty, by a stream of papers and pamphlets. Two of Aldred's closest comrades, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54406/', "Ethel MacDonald")</script> and Jenny Patrick, went to Spain to assist the propaganda effort of the anarchist federation, enabling Aldred to publish firsthand information on events such as the communist attack on the anarchists in Barcelona. In 1939 a &pound;3000 legacy from Sir Walter Strickland enabled him to set up the Strickland Press at 104&#150;6 George Street. Throughout the Second World War he was again active in the struggle against conscription.<br>
<br>Aldred made major contributions to anti-parliamentary communist theory, combining the ideas of Marx and Bakunin and giving priority to self-organized working-class activity. Also, by keeping his press and journals in almost continuous existence for over fifty years, he maintained an open forum for the libertarian left. His most important journals, the <span class="italic">Herald of Revolt</span> (1910&#150;14) and <span class="italic">The Spur</span> (1914&#150;21), enabled different elements of the rebel movement to exchange ideas, while <span class="italic">The Word</span> (1938/9&#150;63) stubbornly proclaimed the anti-parliamentary and anti-militarist message in a hostile world. His many biographical studies rescued from neglect &#145;pioneers&#146; of the movement.<br>
<br>As an anti-militarist and anti-war activist in two world wars, furthermore, Aldred offered uncompromising resistance to conscription&#151;he even held meetings and published a newspaper while imprisoned for conscientious objection during the first, and used his experience and self-taught legal expertise to inspire and assist fellow resisters in the second. In addition he revived interest in an earlier generation of freethinkers, particularly Richard Carlile and Robert Taylor, situating them in a radical political tradition. Aldred was also significant for championing free speech. He received a prison sentence for publishing the banned <span class="italic">Indian Sociologist</span> (1909) and incurred prosecution for publishing Margaret Sanger's &#145;obscene&#146; <span class="italic">Family Limitation</span> (1922). Between the wars he campaigned for the right to public speaking in Glasgow; he was also responsible for the controversial publication of the duke of Bedford's pacifist views in the Second World War.<br>
<br>After the war Aldred campaigned on a number of issues, including world government, neo-colonialism, and American use of UK military bases. In their pursuit he stood as a parliamentary candidate in six post-war elections in Glasgow, the last of which was the Woodside by-election in November 1962. Shortly afterwards, in January 1963, he suffered a heart attack. He resumed speaking and writing, but grew weaker and died in the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, on 16 October 1963. As he had bequeathed his body for research, his funeral, at Maryhill crematorium, was delayed until 4 May 1964.<br>
