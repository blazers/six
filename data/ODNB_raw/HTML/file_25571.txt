<span class="headword">Wells,  Simon  of</span> <span class="st"> [Simon fitz Robert; Simon  de Camera]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1207), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was probably a Somerset man, the son of Robert of Whatley, who held land of William Fitzjohn's fee in Harptree, Somerset, which was confirmed to Simon by King John in 1201. It is doubtful whether, as has been claimed, he was related to Hugh of Wells, bishop of Lincoln (though the two men were linked professionally), or to Jocelin, bishop of Bath and Wells. He owed the advancement of his career in church and royal service entirely to Archbishop Hubert Walter and the first evidence of him comes about 1192, when Hubert, still bishop of Salisbury, collated to him a Salisbury prebend newly formed out of the churches of Lyme and Halstock. It is in this connection that he is called, in the Salisbury register, Simon Fitzrobert.<br>
<br>Simon attested a number of Hubert's <i>acta</i> as archbishop of Canterbury. By 1198 he was archdeacon of Wells, and he obtained the provostship of Beverley in 1199. With his archdeaconry he held the churches of Huish and South Brent in Devon, and as archdeacon he often occurs as the datary of royal documents (the official who organized their issue). He was with King John in Normandy in 1199 and in 1203 during the campaigns against Philip Augustus of France which ended in the loss of the duchy. In 1201 he is recorded as receiving money into the king's chamber from the knights of the archbishopric of Canterbury, thereby giving substance to his title of Simon de Camera, or clerk of the chamber. He was elected bishop of Chichester in early April 1204, being consecrated by Hubert Walter at Westminster on 11 July 1204. The temporalities had been restored by 3 August.<br>
<br>Once he was bishop the royal grants to Simon and his own charters suggest a strong concentration on his pastorate (ordination of vicarages, visitation of monasteries) and on exploiting the material assets of his see&#151;holding the royal farm of Chichester, supervising Chichester mints, building shops round the cathedral cemetery, walling Chichester city, and recovering alienated lands of the see by judgment of his own court. He also received the right to transport marble from Purbeck to Chichester for the repair of his cathedral, thereby showing his interest in the fabric of the building, and also his participation in the architectural aesthetic of the time, which favoured the use of this dark marble against light-coloured stone. His royal service did not immediately cease, for in 1204 he supervised the valuation of Gilbert de l'Aigle's fee, and he was active in the purveyance of supplies for the king's (abortive) Poitevin expedition in 1205, but there is no more evidence of royal service after Hubert Walter's death in July 1205. Bishop Simon died at St Gilles in southern France on 21 August 1207, apparently returning from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela; he left in his will 100 marks towards a chantry for Archbishop Hubert.<br>
