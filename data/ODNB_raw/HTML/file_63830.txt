<span class="headword">Morris,  Henry</span>  (1889&#150;1961), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born on 13 November 1889 at 131 Poulton Road, Southport, Lancashire, the fourth son and seventh of the eight children of William Morris, journeyman plumber, and his wife, Mary Ellen Mullin (<i>d</i>. 1901/2). His mother was Irish, a Roman Catholic until her marriage, and perhaps an influence on his early inclination to a career in the church, though she died when he was twelve. Morris left school at the age of fourteen to work as an office boy on the <span class="italic">Southport Visiter</span>, and from 1906 to 1910 continued his education through adult classes at the Harris Institute, Preston. At the age of twenty-one he began to train for the priesthood at St David's College, Lampeter, and after obtaining a second class in theology moderations, he entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1912. In military service from 1914, he was commissioned in the Royal Army Service Corps and served in France and in Italy. He completed his undergraduate studies at King's College, Cambridge, from 1919 to 1920, in which year he gained an upper second in moral sciences.<br>
<br>Morris made his mark in the inter-war period of educational reorganization, when so much was hoped for and so little realized in the reform of state schooling. Beginning as assistant education secretary in Kent under the careful tutelage of E. Salter Davies in 1920&#150;21, he soon moved to Cambridgeshire and in 1922 succeeded to the post of county education secretary there. His rapid and politically astute achievement of an agreed religious syllabus for the county schools, the first of its kind in England, was a prelude to his inspirational and energetic campaign for village colleges. These entailed the consolidation of county and denominational schools in order to provide a panacea for the widely recognized &#145;rural problem&#146;. The village college was to provide a focus for educational, cultural, and social activity in increasingly depopulated and economically deprived agricultural areas. Morris's achievement in founding four such colleges in Cambridgeshire by 1939 was the result of determined pursuit of the requisite funding, and resolute handling of the resistance which he encountered. The first village college opened at Sawston in 1930. Village colleges aimed to provide not only juvenile and adult education, but also the social and cultural activities Morris saw as necessary for a healthy and progressive rural community. At Oxford he had been deeply influenced by Hastings Rashdall's exposition of the medieval university in its integral relationship with society, but he had been inspired too by the fine architecture of the ancient university town, and he believed passionately in the educational importance of an aesthetic environment, epitomized in the distinguished design which he secured from Walter Gropius for Impington Village College, opened in 1939. R. A. Butler, wartime minister of education, made frequent acknowledgement of Morris's achievement, and in the 1942 birthday honours Morris was made CBE. Cambridgeshire's village colleges provided the model for many developments in community education after the Second World War, for example in Leicestershire, Derbyshire, and Devon.<br>
<br>Morris continued as director of education for nine years after the war, and by this period he had acquired a national reputation, resulting in advisory work for the Colonial Office on provision of further education in west Africa. From 1947 he was seconded part-time by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning to advise on social and cultural provision for the new towns, an extension of his life's work in the context of a highly significant policy developed by the post-war Labour government. One notable achievement in this connection was the establishment of the Digswell community of artists and craftsmen near Welwyn Garden City, a project intended as part of a greater aim of bringing artists into contact with town planners, architects, manufacturers, and the local public. Trustees such as Herbert Read and Gordon Russell demonstrate the level of support which Morris received. He put a great deal of personal commitment and energy into this project, and despite many difficulties it was formally opened in 1959.<br>
<br>Morris's educational innovations sprang from a set of ideals based on his interest in religion, education, science, and the arts. Religion in its widest and deepest sense meant much to him, though his early attachment to the church was severed by war experience and by the teachings of scientific humanism. But above all it was his intense love of beauty in various forms&#151;music, art, poetry, and especially architecture&#151;which underlay his professional and personal life. Dorothy Bimrose, his personal secretary for many years, recalled that &#145;he had no beliefs, no formal religion, yet his passionate belief in beauty and graciousness and in the possibility of full and complete living, was his religion&#146;  (R&eacute;e, Lupton, and others, 13). Friends felt privileged to share his practical gospel of enhancing life by regenerating the culture as a whole, and this gospel was realized through his firm belief in local government and through his pragmatism.<br>
<br>Nan Youngman, art adviser in Cambridgeshire from 1944, described Morris as<blockquote>tall, with a long pale face and wild blue eyes. His hair was mousy, sparse and straight&#151;there was always one long wisp hanging out at the back. He had a beautiful voice, and, as many testify, he was unpredictable in his moods, but never dull. (R&eacute;e, Lupton, and others, 32)</blockquote>His unpredictability embraced a social ambivalence; he despised pomposity but could be snobbish, and embarrassment about his own humble origins is evident from the testimony of former colleagues and from misleading entries in Oxford and Cambridge college registers. He could be by turns generous and close-fisted. He was difficult to work with, demanding and intolerant, and a master of the premeditated insult. Yet Morris inspired loyalty among close friends who admired his infectious and vituperative vivacity and who recorded his antipathy to prejudice and hypocrisy, his deep sense of the humane, and compassion for human suffering. He was hospitable to artistic and intellectual company in the elegance of three successive homes which he occupied throughout his years in Cambridge; both there and on European travel with friends he indulged his aesthetic and culinary tastes. His homosexuality was generally concealed from acquaintances in his lifetime, but more intimate friends later described his sexual passions and frustrations, and his long-standing friendship with Charles Fenn has been well documented by R&eacute;e. Nan Youngman observed that although a homosexual he was almost never unfriendly to women; Jack Pritchard recalled his love of happy families with children and his sadness that he would never marry and have a family himself.<br>
<br>In 1960 Morris officiated at the opening of Comberton Village College in spite of his declining health, and at the end of that year he was persuaded to retire from the ministry of town and country planning. Physical and mental deterioration compounded his characteristically eccentric behaviour, but he continued to receive support from friends and former colleagues. Dementia, pneumonia, and Parkinson's disease combined to cause his death on 10 December 1961 at Hill End Hospital, St Albans, where he had spent his last months. A simple cremation ceremony at Golders Green crematorium on 14 December was attended by Henry Moore and J. B. Priestley, among many old friends. Published tributes and commemorations following his death, and later marking the centenary of his birth, reflected the inspiration and the affection felt by many who had been influenced by his work.<br>
