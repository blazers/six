<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Mary Amelia St Clair <span class="st"> [May]</span></span>  (1863&#150;1946), <span class="occ">novelist and philosopher</span>, was born on 24 August 1863 in Thorncote, Rock Park, Rock Ferry, near Birkenhead, Cheshire, the youngest of six surviving children of William Sinclair (1829&#150;1881), part owner of a Liverpool shipping business, and Amelia (1821/2&#150;1901), daughter of a Belfast merchant, John Hind. In the late 1860s William Sinclair's business began to fail, and about 1870 he became bankrupt, and the family was dispersed. May lived with her mother in Ilford, Cheltenham, and Fairford, Wrexham, Salcombe Regis, and London. She had tuition at home, piano lessons, and access to her father's library, where she read widely in classical and English literature, history, and philosophy. She learned German, Greek, and French before being sent for a year to Cheltenham Ladies' College in 1881, where the influential Dorothea Beale took an interest in her. In that year her father, who had become an alcoholic, died. The family tragedy continued relentlessly with the early deaths of her four brothers from heart failure between 1887 and 1896.<br>
<br>Sinclair's original ambition was to be a poet and philosopher. Her first book, <span class="italic">Nakiketas and other Poems</span> (1886), was published under the pseudonym Julian Sinclair. <span class="italic">Essays in Verse</span> (1892) was her first publication as May Sinclair. Her first essay on idealism came out in the <span class="italic">New World</span> in 1893 (she became the first woman member of the Aristotelian Society after publishing <span class="italic">A Defence of Idealism</span>, 1917). In 1893 Sinclair met and fell in love with Anthony Charles Deane. However, he was ordained in that year and then married someone else in 1898. When her first novel, <span class="italic">Audrey Craven</span>, was published in 1897, Sinclair was poor and trapped, looking after her mother in London lodgings at Christchurch Road, Hampstead. The novel's psychological complexity and frankness became her hallmark, as did the relative sexual explicitness of her second, <span class="italic">Mr. and Mrs. Nevill Tyson</span> (1898). <span class="italic">The Divine Fire</span> (1904), ironically a critique of the bookselling industry, was her first major success, establishing her reputation not only in Britain, but in America, where it was a best-seller. Like much of her fiction it deals with the emotional and psychological lives of artists.<br>
<br>When Joseph Walter, her last surviving brother, died in 1905, Sinclair assumed responsibility for his children, and then for those of her brother William when his widow died in 1906. In August 1907 she took a flat at 4 The Studios, Edwardes Square, Kensington, London. Her friends included H. G. Wells, Ford Madox Ford (then Hueffer), Wyndham Lewis, W. B. Yeats, and Thomas Hardy. Sinclair concentrated on novels exploring the difficulties women faced in sexual, domestic, and intellectual arenas in <span class="italic">The Helpmate</span> and <span class="italic">The Judgement of Eve</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Kitty Tailleur</span> (1908), and <span class="italic">The Creators</span> (1910). From 1907 to 1914 she published a series of fine introductions to the <span class="roman">Everyman Library</span> editions of the Bront&euml; novels (she wrote a full-length study in 1912, and her novel <span class="italic">The Three Sisters</span> draws on the Bront&euml; story). In 1912 she wrote <span class="italic">Feminism</span> for the Women Writers' Suffrage League, of which she was a member. She was also a member of the militant Women's Freedom League. She supported new literary, social, and intellectual movements such as Tagore enthusiasts, imagists, and vorticists. She championed Ezra Pound, and also wrote essays on her friends T. S. Eliot (who published her in <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>), Violet Hunt, H. D., and Richard Aldington (whom she may have loved platonically). She had a particularly intense friendship with Charlotte Mew, who was in love with her.<br>
<br>In October 1913 Sinclair attended the inaugural meeting of the Medico-Psychological Clinic of London, &#145;the first clinic in England to include psychoanalysis in an eclectic array of therapeutic methods&#146;  (Boll, 104). Sinclair wrote the prospectus, and was elected as one of the twelve founder members, and as a member of the board of management. <span class="italic">The Three Sisters</span> (1914) is the first of her novels to explore psychoanalytic concepts such as unconscious motivation. In May 1914 she was also elected to membership of the Society for Psychical Research, which combined interests in scientific psychology and mystical or paranormal phenomena; her <span class="italic">Uncanny Stories</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">The Intercessor, and other Stories</span> explore mystical or psychic themes.<br>
<br>Sinclair moved to 1 Blenheim Road, St John's Wood, London, in March 1914. At the outbreak of the First World War she joined Dr Hector Munro's volunteer ambulance corps as secretary, treasurer, banker, financial supporter, and publicist. They left London on 25 September 1914 for Ostend, Bruges, and Ghent. After two and half weeks Sinclair was sent back to England for more funds, and was shocked to discover Munro had replaced her. The proximity of mortal danger had an intense effect on her, which can be gauged in her war fiction, especially <span class="italic">The Tree of Heaven</span> (1917) and <span class="italic">The Romantic</span> (1920).<br>
<br>In 1916 Sinclair was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In the same year William Lyon Phelps hailed her as &#145;the foremost living writer among English-speaking women&#146; (quoted in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Nov 1946), and she published &#145;Clinical lectures on symbolism and sublimation&#146;, one of the few accounts to appear in an English journal of a schism between Jung and Freud. She was among the earliest novelists to explore psychoanalytic ideas in fiction and criticism, and in 1918 was the first to apply William James's term &#145;stream of consciousness&#146; to literature in an essay on Dorothy Richardson's <span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>. In 1919 she published <span class="italic">Mary Olivier: a Life</span>, a work of experimental modernism, and one of her best novels. Much of her family life formed the basis of this novel: the heroine's love for her brother Mark (Frank); her struggle against the tyranny and religious orthodoxy of the mother, who rejects her daughter's love in favour of her sons; her fear of hereditary madness, alcoholism, and physical weakness; her intense, unconsummated, renounced love for several different men; and the drive to individuation and creativity seeking to escape the trammels of heredity, family, environment, society, and religion. All can be read as fictionalized spiritual biography. By 1920 Sinclair was at the pinnacle of her achievement, and was described by Thomas Moult as &#145;the most widely known woman artist in the country and America&#146;. <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Harriett Frean</span> (1922), the only novel to continue the modernist experiments of <span class="italic">Mary Olivier</span>, was considered by Sinclair to be &#145;one of the best books I have done&#146;  (Boll, 143). It is certainly her most spare and poignant novel, a powerful though understated portrait of female disappointment and repression.<br>
<br>Though her fiction was controversial, Sinclair was personally modest, anxious, fastidious, considerate, fair, and a teetotaller with a passion for being driven in motor cars. Her self-effacing nature&#151;Mark Twain, who sat next to her during a dinner in 1905 in New York in his honour, thanked her for her &#145;remarkably interesting silence&#146;&#151;gave her a particularly sharp eye for arrogance and egotism, especially in the male, which perhaps accounts for some of the controversy.<br>
<br>From 1919 Sinclair began to use Stow on the Wold in the Cotswolds as a writing retreat. Florence Bartrop joined her then as companion, nurse, and housekeeper, replacing her twin sister Nellie, who had been with Sinclair since 1914, and staying with her for the rest of her life. By 1920 Sinclair began to show signs of Parkinson's disease. She disappeared from literary London, and was forgotten. Her last novels are slight and repetitive, and received poor reviews. She wrote nothing after 1927, and lived as a recluse in childlike dependence on Bartrop. She gave up the rented cottage at Stow for another in the Cornish village of Constantine, next to Dorothy Richardson; then she took a permanent room in the White Hart Hotel in Stow. After living in Little Tingewick, Buckinghamshire, from 1932 to 1936, she finally settled with Bartrop at The Gables, 96 Burcott Lane, Bierton, near Aylesbury, where she died on 14 November 1946. She was cremated at Golders Green, London, on 18 November.<br>
<br>Feminist scholarship recovered Sinclair's importance as a transitional figure in the 1970s. There have been two biographies, by Theophilus Boll (1973) and Suzanne Raitt (2000), who acclaimed Sinclair as &#145;one of the few brilliant women philosophers of her time&#146;  (Raitt, 42).<br>
