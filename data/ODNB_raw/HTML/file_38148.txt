<span class="headword">Wood,  John Turtle</span>  (1821&#150;1890), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 13 February 1821 in Hackney, Middlesex, the only child of John Wood (<i>b</i>. 1779), from a Shropshire landowning family, and his wife, Elizabeth Turtle. He was educated privately and at Rossall School, and went on to study architecture under a tutor at Cambridge. In 1850 he was studying in Venice. After his return to Britain he was articled to H. E. Kendall, and practised as an architect in London, at Victoria Square, Grosvenor Place. In 1853 he designed a house in Oatlands Park for J. T. Darke. In the same year he married his first cousin Henrietta Elizabeth (1830/31&#150;1906), daughter of Samuel Wood.<br>
<br>In 1858 Wood accepted an appointment as architect to the Smyrna and Aidin Railway in western Turkey, designing stations on that line. But his great ambition was to discover the remains of the famous temple of Artemis (or Diana) at Ephesus, south of Smyrna, which had completely disappeared from sight in the middle ages.<br>
<br>Accordingly, in 1863 Wood resigned his appointment and began his search. The British Museum agreed to get him a permit and to give him a grant, in return for any antiquities he might discover. In 1867, while excavating in the ancient theatre at Ephesus, he found an inscription in Greek referring to some gold and silver statuettes, which, on festive days, were carried from the temple to the theatre by way of the Magnesian gate. If he could find this gate, he reckoned that there would be a paved road leading to the temple. Late in 1867 he found the gate and the road. Following its course, on 2 May 1869, he found the wall of the temple enclosure. He now bought the site on behalf of the British Museum and set out to find the temple. He found it on the last day of 1869 under nearly 20 feet of sand. The excavation was far from easy. The ground was waterlogged, necessitating constant pumping, so that progress was very slow; but by April 1874 the job was considered done. The temple was a sad ruin, but Wood managed to recover a quantity of very broken sculptures and architectural features, which he sent back to Britain.<br>
<br>In 1874 Wood returned to Britain. For eleven years, loyally assisted by his wife, he had worked under almost intolerable conditions. He suffered constantly from fever; he was frequently threatened by bandits and once nearly murdered; he was injured several times; he endured hot summers and cold winters and periodical earthquakes. In 1875 he gave four lectures on his discoveries at the Royal Institution, and 1877 saw the publication of his book <span class="italic">Discoveries at Ephesus</span>; a second book, <span class="italic">Discoveries on the Site of Ancient Ephesus</span>, published posthumously in 1890, added little to the earlier work. He returned briefly to Ephesus in 1883, without, however, achieving any significant results. In addition to his architectural and archaeological activities, he was also an accomplished artist, and frequently exhibited at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Wood was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1875, a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1874, and an honorary fellow of the RIBA in 1878. In 1875 the British government awarded him a pension of &pound;200 per annum in recognition of his discoveries at Ephesus. He had one son, who died aged thirty-two in 1889. This domestic tragedy probably hastened his own death from heart disease on 25 March 1890, at home at 66 Marine Parade, Worthing, Sussex. He was buried in the churchyard of Christ Church, Worthing<br>
