<span class="headword">Berry,  (Henry) Seymour</span>, Baron Buckland  (1877&#150;1928), <span class="occ">financier and coal industrialist</span>, was born at 73 Lower Thomas Street, Merthyr Tudful, on 17 September 1877, the eldest of three sons of John Mathias Berry (<i>d</i>. 1917), JP, estate agent and valuer, of Gwaelod-y-garth, Merthyr Tudful, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Thomas Rowe of Pembroke Dock. He was educated locally at Caedraw higher grade school and (as a pupil teacher) at Abermorlais School. He soon left teaching to join his father's business where he stayed for two decades. On 5 September 1907 he married Gwladys Mary, eldest daughter of Simon Sandbrook JP, of Hawthorns, Merthyr Tudful, and they had five daughters. Both he and his wife, as natives and long-term residents of the town, shared a deep interest in the fortunes of Merthyr.<br>
<br>Berry seems to have had no direct involvement with the coal industry until about 1916, at just under forty, when his name first appeared in the <span class="italic">South Wales Coal Annual</span>. In the next two years he became a major star in what was then the glittering industrial firmament of south Wales. The transformation was not fortuitous: as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Lord Rhondda, the dominant figure in the Welsh coal industry and trade, Berry had a head start owing to the long family connection through his father, who had several times acted as election agent for Rhondda (when still D. A. Thomas). The initial opportunity was soon greatly added to when Rhondda was persuaded by David Lloyd George to join the wartime government; this necessarily threw much more responsibility and control onto his industrial lieutenants and the shift was given a permanent status with Rhondda's death in July 1918. Once thus provided with the opportunities, Berry's remarkable business gifts flourished, especially in visualizing and negotiating mergers and acquisitions.<br>
<br>After a few years of relative quiet Rhondda had in 1916 launched a new offensive to expand his industrial empire, and in that single year it swallowed at least four major companies (Gwaun-cae-Gurwen; Celtic Collieries; North's Navigation; and D. Davis &amp; Son). Closely involved were the two contemporaries described as Rhondda's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s&#151;H. S. Berry and the stockbroker Archibald Mitchelson&#151;who &#145;are on the Boards of several of the companies of which Lord Rhondda is Chairman&#146;  (<span class="italic">South Wales Coal Annual</span>, 1917, 143). Already in 1916, when Rhondda became food controller, Berry was chairman of one of these companies (Celtic Collieries). With his main allies&#151;Mitchelson and D. R. Llewellyn&#151;the campaign of expansion was continued into the 1920s. At one stage on the boards of more than sixty companies, at the time of his death Berry still held a position on about twenty of the larger companies (including the massive steel company of Guest Keen and Nettlefolds, of which he became chairman in 1927). The process was one of financial engineering, but the motivation seems to have been production-orientated: consolidating the coal holdings of various undertakings and, especially, negotiating sales and distribution.<br>
<br>Raised to the peerage in 1926 Berry wished to choose as his title Baron Bwlch, but the authorities refused him Bwlch and he settled for Baron Buckland of Bwlch. It is probably a record of sorts that, despite being from a non-aristocratic family and an unfashionable industrial town, not only he but his two brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30733/', "William Ewert Berry")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30731/', "(James) Gomer Berry")</script> (later Viscount Camrose and Viscount Kemsley, respectively), attained peerages. Perhaps no less remarkable for a strong-willed and powerful trio, they were mutually supportive: William Berry's first newspaper-owning venture of 1901 derived all of its capital (&pound;100) from a loan by Seymour Berry, and William and his younger brother, also a newspaper tycoon, shared a joint bank account for three decades.<br>
<br>Berry trod a familiar path for Welsh industrialists, from Liberal to Conservative, but it was a Labour-controlled council which in 1923 made him a freeman of the borough in recognition of his many benefactions to Merthyr. Although the council disliked his politics it esteemed him for his civic virtue. He does not seem to have been directly involved in industrial relations, but he was reputed to have helped relieve unemployment distress in his native Merthyr by keeping open the G. K. N. ironworks at Dowlais and by buying a local colliery which was to have been dismantled.<br>
<br>At his country estate, Buckland, Bwlch, Brecknockshire, Berry enjoyed rural pursuits. He died there on 23 May 1928: death resulted instantly from a head injury while he was taking a customary early morning ride&#151;his horse suddenly veered close to a telegraph pole, and he was dashed against it. His funeral service was held on 26 May at the Congregational church, Market Square, Merthyr, of which Berry had been a lifelong member. Vast crowds gathered along the route, in the town, and towards Pontypridd, where he was then cremated. He was survived by his wife and his five daughters, and the barony became extinct on his death.<br>
