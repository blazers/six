<span class="headword">MacCrimmon family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1600&#150;1746), <span class="occ">pipers</span>, were hereditary pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, holding tenancies at Boreraig, Galtrigill, and Borrodale. The origins of the MacCrimmons are obscure. Genealogies of the family have been produced, based mostly on James Logan's unreliable introduction to Angus Mackay's <span class="italic">A Collection of Ancient Piobaireachd</span> (1838). They rely more on tradition, inference, and even invention, than on accurate records. However, through the tangle of romance attached to the name, there is no doubt that the MacCrimmons were masters and renowned teachers of <i>ce&ograve;l m&ograve;r</i>&#151;the classical music of the highland bagpipes, also known as piobaireachd (pibroch).<br>
<br>In May 1651 a &#145;John M'gyurmen&#146; was declared by his fellow pipers to be &#145;the Prince of Pipers&#146;  (NL Scot., 3658, Wardlaw MS p. 379). Charles II called him forward and permitted him to kiss his hand, upon which the piper composed the piobaireachd <span class="italic">Thug mi p&ograve;g do l&agrave;imh an righ</span>. Opinion has it that &#145;M'gyurmen&#146; (a name otherwise unknown) is a rendering of the name MacCrimmon though, as piper to the &#145;Earle of Sutherland&#146;, the player in question would not have been employed by the MacLeods.<br>
<br>Further evidence of the family's employment and status can be found in the records of the MacLeod estates, but they do not appear on the rent rolls as they probably held their lands rent-free, as did Roderick Morison. That they were formally recognized as teachers is reflected in an entry for 1698 referring to the &#145;Prentisep of McIntyre ye pyper with McCrooman&#146;. Their musical prowess is mentioned in the Gaelic poems of Mary MacLeod&#151;notably <span class="italic">Cr&ograve;nan an taibh</span> (composed shortly after 1666), which refers to P&agrave;draig M&ograve;r and his &#145;p&igrave;ob nuallanach mh&ograve;r&#146; or &#145;great shrill-voiced pipe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gaelic Songs of Mary MacLeod</span>, ed. J. Carmichael Watson, 1934, 44&#150;5). Thomas Pennant refers to the MacCrimmons as hereditary pipers to the MacLeods of Skye, holding land rent-free and receiving pupils at their piping college; and when Boswell and Johnson visited the MacLeod stronghold of Dunvegan in 1773, Johnson recorded, &#145;There has been in Sky, beyond all time of memory, a college of pipers, under the direction of Macrimmon, which is not quite extinct.&#146;<br>
<br>The main members of the family were <a name="cosubject_76530"></a><span class="headword">Donald M&ograve;r MacCrimmon</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1600&#150;1614)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_76531"></a><span class="headword">Patrick M&ograve;r MacCrimmon</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1640&#150;1670)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_48901"></a><span class="headword">Patrick &Oacute;g MacCrimmon</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1650)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_76532"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm MacCrimmon</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1743)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_76533"></a><span class="headword">Domhnall B&agrave;n MacCrimmon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1746)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_76534"></a><span class="headword">Donald Ruadh MacCrimmon</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1731)<span class="occ"></span>; and to them are attributed a number of piobaireachd, often on legendary rather than historical grounds, their skills having been originally acquired from the fairies&#151;a common motif in Gaelic mythology. However, there is historical as well as stylistic support for some of the attributions. Donald M&ograve;r is credited with the composition of &#145;MacLeod's Salute&#146;, a tune which shares a characteristic fingering feature with others attributed to him. A remission granted under the great seal on 13 January 1614 refers to a piper called Donald MacCruimien, and it is assumed that this is the same man. Patrick M&ograve;r is said to have composed &#145;The Lament for the Children&#146;, one of the most famous and extended of piobaireachd. Others attributed to him also tend to be extended, though &#145;Cumha Dhomhnaill an Lagain&#146; is an exception. It was said that this lament for Donald of Laggan was played nightly in Dunvegan as Donald's daughter, wife to the MacLeod, could not sleep without hearing it.<br>
<br>Patrick &Oacute;g is particularly remembered for the lament for Iain Garve of Raasay and the beautiful and gentle lament for Mary MacLeod, who was unofficial bard as well as nurse to the MacLeods and who died in 1707.<br>
<br>Patrick &Oacute;g's son Malcolm is said to have composed a lament for his half-brother Domhnall B&agrave;n, known both as a song, &#145;Cha till mi tuille&#146;, and in piobaireachd form as &#145;MacCrimmon's lament&#146;. It was believed to have been composed after MacCrimmon foresaw his own death following the rout of Moy (1746), and there is some evidence to support the story  (see Blankenhorn, 1978).<br>
<br>The MacCrimmons were far from being the only major family of hereditary pipers. The MacArthurs and MacKays too ran piping schools. However, the MacCrimmons were undoubtedly leading figures in the development of piobaireachd, though the publication of a thorough scholarly study of the family and its music is still awaited.<br>
