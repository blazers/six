<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  Neil</span>  (1779/80&#150;1853), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Glasgow, was the fifth son of John Douglas, a Glasgow merchant, and descendant of the Douglases, earls of Angus, through the Douglases of Cruxton and Stobbs. He entered the army as second lieutenant in the 95th regiment (later the Rifle brigade) on 28 January 1801. He was promoted lieutenant on 16 July 1802, and captain into the 79th (Cameron Highlanders) on 19 April 1804. This was the regiment with which he served most of the rest of his military career.<br>
<br>Douglas first saw active service in the siege of Copenhagen in 1807, and then he and his regiment accompanied Sir John Moore to Sweden and Portugal. He served throughout Moore's retreat and in the battle of Corunna, in the expedition to the Walcheren and at the siege of Flushing in 1809, and in the Peninsula from December 1809; he served in Portugal until he was promoted major on 31 January 1811. The only great Peninsular battle at which he was present in this period was Busaco, during which he was shot through the left arm and shoulder; on promotion he left the Peninsula to join the 2nd battalion of his regiment.<br>
<br>Douglas was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 3 December 1812, and in the following April rejoined the 1st battalion in the Peninsula. He commanded this force, which was attached to the 2nd brigade of Cole's division, in the battles of the Pyrenees&#151;the Nivelle, the Nive, and Toulouse&#151;and at the end of the war he was rewarded with a gold cross for these victories. In the following year the regiment was reduced to one battalion, which Douglas commanded both at Quatre Bras, where he was wounded in the right knee, and at Waterloo. After this campaign he was made a CB (June 1815) and also received a wound pension of &pound;300 a year. In 1816 Douglas married the daughter of George Robertson, a banker, of Greenock. They had one son.<br>
<br>Douglas continued to command his regiment for twenty-two years until he became a major-general, and during that period many distinctions were conferred upon him. In 1825 he was promoted colonel, and from 1825 to 1837 he was an aide-de-camp to the king; in 1831 he was knighted (September), made a KCH, and permitted to wear the orders of Maria Theresa and St Vladimir, conferred for his services at Waterloo. In July 1838 he was made a KCB. He was promoted major-general in June 1838, and lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846. In 1845 he was made colonel of the 81st regiment, from which he was transferred to the 72nd in 1847, and to the 78th, in 1851. From April 1842 to January 1847 he was governor of Edinburgh Castle.<br>
<br>Douglas died in Brussels on 1 September 1853 and was buried that month. His son was General Sir John Douglas GCB (1817&#150;1887), a distinguished commander in India during the suppression of the mutiny.<br>
