<span class="headword">Cairns, Sir  Hugh William  Bell</span>  (1896&#150;1952), <span class="occ">neurosurgeon</span>, was born on 26 June 1896 in Port Pirie, South Australia. His father, William Cairns (1868&#150;1958), a carpenter and joiner, had emigrated from Glasgow in 1889 and married Amy Florence Bell (1867&#150;1964), a local music teacher. In 1903 they moved to the small township of Riverton, where Hugh Cairns, their only child, had his early education before obtaining scholarships to the high school in Adelaide and the University of Adelaide. In May 1915, at the beginning of the fourth year of his medical course, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC) as a private and was posted to a general hospital on Lemnos during the Gallipoli campaign. He then returned to Adelaide to complete his medical studies, qualifying MB, BS in June 1917. Rejoining the AAMC as captain, he served in France until January 1919, and then entered Balliol College, Oxford, with a Rhodes scholarship. There he studied physiology under C. S. Sherrington, and anatomy, and rowed for the university in the 1920 boat race. House appointments followed at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, and at the London Hospital, where he became an assistant to Professor Turnbull in the pathology department. He passed the FRCS Eng. in November 1921; on 24 November he married Barbara Forster Smith (1896&#150;1987), the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36129/', "A. L. Smith (1850&#150;1924)")</script>, master of Balliol; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>For the next three years Cairns worked as first assistant to several surgeons at the London Hospital and published original work in the genito-urinary field. He gave a Hunterian lecture in 1926 and was appointed honorary assistant surgeon to the London Hospital. Then, advised by the neurologist George Riddoch, he obtained a Rockefeller fellowship and spent a year in the USA, working under Harvey Cushing, the famous Boston neurosurgeon. On returning to the London, Cairns determined to specialize in neurosurgery, but remained responsible for some general surgical patients. A Medical Research Council <span class="roman">Special Report</span> summarizing Cushing's methods brought him recognition; and, together with Geoffrey Jefferson in Manchester and Norman Dott in Edinburgh, he helped to lay the foundations of modern British neurosurgery. In 1931 he joined the staff of the Maida Vale Hospital as a neurosurgeon, while continuing his work at the London Hospital where he became a full surgeon in June 1933 and then practised neurosurgery exclusively. He also had a part-time appointment at the National Hospital, Queen Square, and was a consultant to the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, Millbank.<br>
<br>Cairns's reputation flowered. After a further visit to Cushing in 1935 he proposed plans for a medical school at Oxford. With the munificence of Lord Nuffield, and the support of Sir Farquhar Buzzard, and others, he provided much of the impetus that led the university to give its approval, and was appointed its first Nuffield professor of surgery in 1937. In April 1938 the department of neurological surgery was opened at the Radcliffe Infirmary; Cairns was awarded an honorary DM degree and became a fellow of Balliol.<br>
<br>Following the Munich agreement in September 1938, Cairns ordered supplies of those neurosurgical instruments that the army would require in the event of war and, with Charles Symonds and George Riddoch, organized a hospital for head injuries in St Hugh's College, Oxford. Its importance during the subsequent war was paramount; its archives were later deposited in St Hugh's College Library. According to Charles Symonds,<blockquote>After Munich Cairns formed the idea of a special hospital for head injuries at Oxford and a project of this kind in his mind could not rest without action. As a planner he was supreme, nor did he ever hesitate to put his plans forward at the highest operative level. Thus in a very short time the war office decided to take over St Hugh's College as a hospital for head injuries. (Fraenkel, 140)</blockquote>Cairns achieved the peak of his career during the Second World War. After a short time as an adviser to the Ministry of Health, he began work at the military hospital for head injuries based at St Hugh's, when it opened in February 1940. Beginning with 50 beds it eventually held 430 by the time of the invasion of Normandy. Among the hospital's staff were the neurologists D. Denny-Brown and W. Ritchie Russell, the pathologist Dorothy Russell, and the bacteriologist and bee-keeper G. T. &#145;Daddy&#146; Western. St Hugh's became &#145;a bustling, keen, sort of place&#146;  (Fraenkel, 141), where Cairns was able to carry out research into the incidence of epilepsy after brain injury, the assessment of the psychological state of the brain-injured patient, and electroencephalography. Work was also carried out on the nature of concussion. The college gardens played an important part in helping patients to recuperate, and are discussed in Anthony Babbington's book <span class="italic">No Memorial</span> (1954), which offers a patient's view of St Hugh's.<br>
<br>In June 1940 Cairns was gazetted lieutenant, acting colonel RAMC, and later brigadier. In the same year he created the first of eight mobile neurosurgical units, to operate close to the action, and was also responsible for introducing specially designed crash helmets for army motorcyclists, thereby dramatically reducing their injuries. He set up rehabilitation centres for head-injured patients at Middleton Park, near Bicester, and Tusmore Park, and from at least 1943 worked with Howard Florey in assessing the value of penicillin in treating and preventing wound infection. Cairns was president of the section of neurology of the Royal Society of Medicine, and later presided over the Society of British Neurological Surgeons from 1945 to 1948, and the Association of Surgeons in 1947.<br>
<br>It had been Cairns's intention that the Oxford medical school should be a centre of excellence, where selected graduates would be trained in research. However, with the onset of war it developed as an undergraduate school. Nevertheless, Cairns always hoped that his original idea might eventually be adopted. Teaching was always one of his prime concerns, and many of the next generation of neurosurgeons were trained by him according to the principles laid down by Cushing.<br>
<br>Cairns was knighted (KBE) in June 1946. He was closely involved in post-war planning, on which he left his mark. He became the first Sims travelling professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1948 and lectured in New Zealand, Australia, and southern Africa. His association with Florey stimulated an interest in the treatment of infections of the central nervous system, particularly tuberculous meningitis, which occupied his attention for the rest of his life. He was also interested in the surgery of mental illness and the physiology of consciousness. Important work was being produced in these fields, when a lymphosarcoma of the caecum brought about his untimely death in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, at the age of fifty-six, on 18 July 1952. Four days later he was buried at Holywell church, Oxford, following a funeral service at the university church of St Mary. Memorial services were held at St Mary's, Oxford, and St Philip's, London Hospital.<br>
<br>A handsome, rather tense man, Cairns possessed enormous energy and charm, and a tremendous drive that supported his ambition and ideas. He had a gift for attracting loyal and able co-workers, whom he led with imagination, sparing neither himself nor them, striving hard for whatever he wanted. His devotion to music and literature was stimulated and supported by Lady Cairns, who survived her husband. The Cairns Library at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, is named after him.<br>
