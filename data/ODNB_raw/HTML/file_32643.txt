<span class="headword">Cross,  Kenneth Mervyn Baskerville</span>  (1890&#150;1968), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 71 Parliament Hill Road, Hampstead, London, on 8 December 1890, the eldest son of Alfred William Stephen Cross (1858&#150;1932), architect, and his wife, Emily Thursfield. A. W. S. Cross was himself the son of an architect, Alfred Cross, of Greenwich, and practised in Hastings, Weston-super-Mare, and London. He specialized in the design of swimming baths, public libraries, and schools, including baths in Dulwich, Hoxton, and Hampstead. In 1906 he restored Shoreditch town hall following a fire. Kenneth was the cousin of the judge Geoffrey Cross, Baron Cross of Chelsea, and Sir Rupert Cross, who were sons of his father's younger brother.<br>
<br>Kenneth Cross was educated at Felsted School (1902&#150;9), where he captained the cricket eleven. He then went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He obtained a third class in both parts of the historical tripos (1911 and 1912) and proceeded MA in 1921. He studied at the university school of architecture, in the founding of which his father had played an important part. He completed his professional training in articles to his father, setting up in private practice in 1919, and becoming his father's partner in 1922. In a wide-ranging general practice he acted as architect for a number of local authorities including Westminster city council, Newcastle upon Tyne council, and Bournemouth council. He also carried out commissions for the Barbers' Company and for the Grocers' Company, the London Hospital, St John's College, Cambridge, and Barclays Bank.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Cross had, like his father before him, earned a reputation as a specialist in the design and construction of swimming baths, and, with his father, had written a book on the subject: <span class="italic">Modern Public Baths and Wash-Houses</span> (1930), of which a new edition appeared in 1938. He had previously revised his father's <span class="italic">Practical Notes for Architectural Draughtsmen</span> (2nd and 3rd series, 1922, 1923), a useful guide for students, in whom he was always interested. In architecture he was a solid traditionalist with a good appreciation of modern structural techniques. Cross was best-known for his devoted work for the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), of which he became a fellow in 1931 and was president from 1956 to 1958, having previously served as honorary secretary (1952&#150;5) and as vice-president (1955&#150;6). He was chairman of the board of architectural education from 1950 to 1952, chairman of the competitions' committee from 1937 to 1949, and served on a number of the royal institute's other committees. He was chairman of the committee on the constitution of the council, and also of the committee on the architects registration acts.<br>
<br>Kenneth Cross was a quiet, soft-spoken, and unassuming man of friendly aspect. In private life he was interested in English literature, gardening, and walking. He seemed to come from a generation older than himself, and, although somewhat diffident in conversation, below the surface his standards were high and his opinions firmly based. He became president of the RIBA at a time when the senior members, who had seen the royal institute through the Second World War, attempted to re-establish it as it had been, predominantly a learned society, inward-looking and comfortably unaware of the changes taking place in architecture and the building industry. They were, above all, unaware of, or perhaps just not interested in, the aspirations of the generation of architects trained after the war, which felt that the older generation was essentially out of date and that the profession needed total reorganization within an efficient and aggressive institute. It fell to Cross as honorary secretary to attend, and afterwards as president to preside over, meetings at which these views were forcefully made known. The annual general meeting of the RIBA changed during Cross's time from a peaceful, badly attended, and unquestioning affair to a crowded battlefield where officers of the institute were attacked and received little support from the floor. Few regretted the passing of the old order and the introduction of important electoral, educational, and administrative reforms which followed. The importance of Kenneth Cross's part in these reforms should not be underestimated. His manner in the chair was impeccable. He was urbane but firm, tolerant, even-tempered, and procedurally correct. He could be witty but sometimes there was a glint of steel in his remarks. He retained control at all times, and his wisdom ensured the introduction of constructive change. Whatever his personal feelings were, he met the storms graciously and with understanding. During his presidency and largely on his own initiative, he made a world tour of the royal institute's allied societies which much improved relations between the RIBA and its overseas members.<br>
<br>Cross was an honorary DCL of Durham University, an honorary fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, the American Institute of Architects, and the New Zealand Institute of Architects, and a life fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. He died at Chelmsford Hospital on 16 January 1968. He was unmarried.<br>
