<span class="headword">Martival,  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1250&#150;1330), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was almost the last of a knightly family named from the Norman village of Martinvaast, near Cherbourg. On the death of his father, Sir Anketil de Martival, in 1274 he became lord of Noseley in Leicestershire. His father had endowed a chantry chapel in the manor house, which in the fourteenth century the son further endowed and converted into one of the earliest chantry colleges.<br>
<br>Roger Martival was born <i>c</i>.1250: he was a minor in December 1269 and in 1268 was presented, as an acolyte, to the rectory of Arnold, Nottinghamshire. He apparently used the rectory's income to support himself at Oxford University, where he studied under Gilbert Seagrave (<i>d</i>. 1312). At the university in 1274 he was a party to the terms of peace agreed between the northern and southern scholars. The claim that he was a fellow of Merton College rests on inadequate evidence. In 1280, as a master of arts, he was granted protection on going overseas, evidently to the University of Paris, where he was studying in 1282.<br>
<br>In 1286 or 1287 Oliver Sutton, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1299), collated Martival to the archdeaconry of Huntingdon and to the prebend of Sleaford. He apparently continued to teach and study at Oxford: in 1293, as a doctor of theology, he became chancellor of the university. He resigned the chancellorship in 1295, shortly after being collated to the archdeaconry of Leicester, which in turn he resigned in 1310 on being elected dean of Lincoln. Meanwhile he had been collated to the prebend of Netheravon in Salisbury Cathedral in 1298 by Bishop Simon Ghent (<i>d</i>. 1315), his predecessor both as chancellor of Oxford University and as bishop of Salisbury, and formerly a fellow archdeacon in Lincoln diocese. He was also prebendary of Flixton in Lichfield Cathedral from 1306, and, having resigned Arnold, was rector of Thurcaston, Leicestershire, until 1315. Lincoln chapter records show that after he had journeyed to the papal court in 1306&#150;7, Martival was in residence at Lincoln for at least eight months in each year until 1315. As dean, he was in dispute with the chapter about the exercise of his jurisdiction; this was resolved in 1314, when Bishop John Dalderby (<i>d</i>. 1320) confirmed that the dean should act in principal matters only with the chapter's consent.<br>
<br>Martival was elected bishop of Salisbury on 11 June 1315. Although Thomas of Lancaster, his overlord at Noseley, was then powerful at court, the election was apparently made freely by the chapter of which he was a member, the last such election at Salisbury during the middle ages apart from that in 1417. A conscientious and effective diocesan, Martival played little part in national affairs, though he was appointed to the king's council in 1318 following the treaty of Leake between Edward II and Lancaster. In his fifteen years as bishop he appears to have been out of the diocese for a total of less than a hundred weeks, and nearly a third of that total was during 1318&#150;19. He was active in consecrating churches, in attempting to persuade John XXII to moderate papal provisions, and in ordaining and augmenting vicarages. The novel arrangement of his registers reflects the efficiency of his diocesan administration and his pioneering activity in church court matters. His concern for the well-being of the cathedral was marked by his endowment of the choristers and the vicars-choral, and particularly by the formulation of his constitutions of 1319, fulfilling his predecessor's intention to ensure the observance of St Osmund's statutes. He died on 14 March 1330, and was buried in a tomb, which survives, on the north side of the cathedral presbytery.<br>
