<span class="headword">Farmer,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1591&#150;1601), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was still &#145;in youth&#146; in 1591, according to a eulogistic poem printed in his collection of canons of that year, <span class="italic">Divers and Sundry Ways of Two Parts in one &hellip; upon one Plainsong</span>. In the following year he was a major contributor to Thomas East's <span class="italic">The Whole Book of Psalms</span>. By February 1595 Farmer was in Dublin, having been appointed organist and master of the choristers at Christ Church Cathedral, and on 10 August 1596 he became a vicar-choral there. An unauthorized absence led to a reprimand in 1597, and he was ordered to return by 1 August on pain of dismissal. In 1598 he was presented to the living of Kilsheelan, partly in co. Tipperary and partly in co. Waterford; he probably appointed a deputy to act for him. By early 1599, when his <span class="italic">The First Set of English Madrigals to Four Voices</span> (dedicated, like his canons, to Edward de Vere, earl of Oxford) was published, he had moved to Broad Street in London. In 1601 he contributed a madrigal to <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span>, the collection in honour of the aged Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Though Farmer's number of publications was modest, they covered a wide range of musical forms and revealed a composer as competent as he was versatile. His 1591 canons show a remarkable resourcefulness and sometimes great ingenuity, Farmer using the same traditional chant forty times as a cantus firmus (&#145;fixed part&#146;), each time devising a different two-part canon against it. At the opposite extreme of technical skill, he provided some simple but wholly admirable four-part harmonizations for seven of the traditional psalm tunes in East's 1592 psalter, and also for the thirteen introductory pieces (including canticles, hymns, and Lord's prayer). But it is for his madrigals that Farmer is remembered. Though his single collection was advertised as for four voices, he slipped in the sonorous eight-voice &#145;You blessed bowers&#146; at the end, a piece that, like his six-voice <span class="italic">Oriana</span> madrigal, &#145;Fair nymph, I heard one telling&#146;, shows his mastery of complex textures. There is one other maverick piece, for in &#145;Take time while time doth last&#146; Farmer employed a cantus firmus, this time four statements of the same six notes slowly rising and falling stepwise in the tenor; however, the style of the remaining three parts and the heavily moralizing text raises a suspicion that this may in fact have been an earlier piece, perhaps originally for instruments, but to which words had now been fitted. In his true madrigals it is Farmer's deftness and lightness that is his most admirable and appealing characteristic, exemplified in &#145;A little pretty bonny lass&#146; and above all in &#145;Fair Phyllis I saw sitting all alone&#146;, which has always been one of the most popular of English madrigals. &#145;Sweet friend, thy absence grieves my bleeding heart&#146; was an occasional piece, composed by Farmer &#145;for the love of his most dear friend, Edmund Keane&#146;, while another, &#145;O stay, sweet love&#146;, also survives in manuscript with a sacred text, &#145;Look up, sad soul&#146;, substituted. A pavan and galliard by Farmer were printed in Philip Rosseter's <span class="italic">Lessons for Consort</span> in 1609. Nothing is known of Farmer's later career or of the date of his death.<br>
