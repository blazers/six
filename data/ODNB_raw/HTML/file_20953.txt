</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ouseley, Sir  Frederick Arthur Gore</span>, second baronet  (1825&#150;1889), <span class="occ">church musician</span>, was born on 12 August 1825 in Grosvenor Square, London, the fourth and youngest surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20955/', "Sir Gore Ouseley, first baronet (1770&#150;1844)")</script>, orientalist and diplomatist, and his wife, Harriet Georgina, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29300/', "John Whitelocke (1757&#150;1833)")</script>. From the age of three he displayed remarkable musical gifts and he soon began to compose. However, he received no disciplined training in music, and after private education proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1843. He inherited his father's title in 1844 and took his BA degree in 1846.<br>
<br>Ouseley then prepared himself for ordination in the Church of England. At the same time he worked towards the degree of BMus (1850), for which he composed as his &#145;exercise&#146; a sacred cantata. It was unprecedented for anyone of his class to take this degree, then anomalous in status and poorly esteemed. He later wrote that, together with ordination, this was part of his purpose &#145;to do something to raise the music of the Sanctuary&#146;. Of high-church tendencies, he was also among the first and eventually the most influential of those who, following John Jebb, held that the services of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> should properly be sung wherever possible, not only in cathedrals. Ouseley was made deacon in 1849 and became curate in the parish of St Paul's, Knightsbridge, London. He was personally insulted during the No Popery riots evoked by the so-called ritualism of its daughter church of St Barnabas, Pimlico. Disturbed by apparent signs of Erastianism in the Church of England, he resigned at the end of 1850. Eventually, after extensive travels in Europe, he decided that his vocation as clergyman lay in a country parish.<br>
<br>However, Ouseley was insistent on daily choral services. To meet this exceptional requirement he built at his own expense the parish church of St Michael just outside Tenbury, Worcestershire, together with adjoining buildings to accommodate a miniature foundation, St Michael's College, for the personnel required for the choral services and the education of the choristers. The church was consecrated in 1856, and, having taken priest's orders in 1855, Ouseley became incumbent of the parish and warden of the college, where he remained until his death. To the college, which he intended to &#145;form a model for the choral service of the Church in these realms&#146;, he devoted the whole of his means.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1854 Ouseley had taken the degree of DMus, and when the following year the Oxford chair of music fell vacant he was appointed, only eight days after the death of Sir Henry Rowley Bishop. As he was unknown to the profession of music and without scholarly achievement behind him, this alacrity may be explained by the fact that he was the only DMus who, as an MA, was a member of convocation. The post, involving only part-time duties, was compatible with his work at Tenbury. In 1886 he became also a canon of Hereford Cathedral, having held the titular dignity of precentor from 1855, and it was at Hereford during a period of canonical residence that he died, unmarried and suddenly, on 6 April 1889. He was buried on 11 April at St Michael's Church, Tenbury.<br>
<br>As a composer, though an able contrapuntist, Ouseley lacked gifts of significant invention. Of two oratories, <span class="italic">The Martyrdom of St Polycarp</span> (DMus, 1854) is a mild essay after Mendelssohn, whereas <span class="italic">Hagar</span> (Hereford festival, 1873) is lifeless. His small secular output is unimportant. In church music his ideals lay in the past. From more than seventy-five anthems, large and small, some with orchestra, few have justified survival like the short, austere &#145;O Saviour of the world&#146; and the bigger, livelier &#145;It came even to pass&#146;. His thirteen services include two for double choir, of which one has orchestral accompaniment, but have nothing to say at the end of the twentieth century. His essential contribution to church music lies in the valuable influence exerted through St Michael's College on standards in both parish churches and cathedrals.<br>
<br>In scholarship, only Ouseley's edition of <span class="italic">The Sacred Compositions of Orlando Gibbons</span> (1873) requires mention. But as professor he improved the status of Oxford music degrees by introducing examinations in addition to the requirement of an original composition, and by providing that candidates must pass responsions, the preliminary examination for the BA degree. Though his syllabus was narrow and university residence was not required, these reforms (in step with Cambridge) proved the first stage towards establishing music as a university discipline. He also amassed a celebrated private library of antiquarian music and musical literature amounting to about 3500 volumes, including important manuscripts and many treatises, some rare. This passed to St Michael's College, upon the closure of which in 1985 its great substance became the property of the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
<br>Reputedly short-tempered, Ouseley was nevertheless held in affection by former pupils and was not above a frolic. At leisure, he enjoyed singing Spanish and Italian national songs to his improvised guitar accompaniment.<br>
