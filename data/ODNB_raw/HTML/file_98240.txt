<span class="headword">Hand,  Rupert</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1846), <span class="occ">army officer in the Colombian service and teacher in Venezuela</span>, was born in Dublin into a Catholic family. Nothing is known about his life until 1818, when he joined the British legion of mercenaries who fought for the independence of Spain's American colonies. His military career was characterized by numerous cases of indiscipline and violence. The first incident took place in November 1819 in the Venezuelan town of Matur&iacute;n, where his unit was quartered. Captain Hand challenged Lieutenant William Lynch to a duel, which resulted in a &#145;severe gunshot wound to [Hand's] left testicle&#146;  (Archivo General de la Naci&oacute;n, Venezuela, ilustres pr&oacute;ceres, vol. 40, fol. 9). He later claimed that he had received the injury by pulling heavy artillery in the subsequent campaign. Less than a year later he was involved in another violent confrontation with a fellow soldier. Out marching in Venezuelan Guayana in October 1820, Private John Lons had verbally insulted Hand. In response Hand drew his sword and hit Lons twice, leaving him for dead. Reacting to this, Hand's entire battalion rebelled and chased him through the streets of the town of Soledad, waving their rifles and bayonets, shouting &#145;Kill him! Kill him!&#146;  (Archivo General de la Naci&oacute;n, Colombia, asuntos criminales, vol. 76, fol. 131). Hand's life was only saved when General Santiago Mari&ntilde;o allowed him to hide in his house. A military court found Hand innocent of any wrongdoing, and ordered one in ten of the soldiers implicated to be executed&#151;this led to the deaths of fifteen soldiers, in addition to Lons.<br>
<br>Hand continued in the republican service, taking part in the battle of Carabobo (1821), and the coastal campaigns on Zulia, Puerto Cabello, and Coro in 1822. In 1823 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in 1824 he was retired due to ill health. He went to the Andean town of M&eacute;rida to regain his health, but was shortly afterwards arrested for robbing the post office. A supreme court martial in Bogot&aacute; later acquitted him of any crime, in response to the numerous references to Hand's character it received from high-ranking officers. Between 1825 and 1829 Hand lived in Bogot&aacute; on a military invalid pension. There is no evidence that he had any partner or children. During this time he claimed to have been robbed of the 3250 pesos which the Colombian government had awarded him for his services.<br>
<br>In 1829 Hand was recalled to the Colombian army and promoted to the rank of commandant, and attached to the expedition led by General Daniel Florence O'Leary to suppress the rebellion of Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a C&oacute;rdova in the province of Antioquia. The campaigning army was 900 strong and led almost entirely by such foreign officers as O'Leary and Hand. After crossing the Andes from Bogot&aacute; they encountered the rebels at El Santuario, near Medell&iacute;n, on 17 October 1829. C&oacute;rdova was outnumbered three to one, but was undeterred. O'Leary's forces manoeuvred themselves into a victorious position within hours, and C&oacute;rdova received serious wounds to the chest and shoulder, forcing him to retire to a small house to the side of the battlefield. An armed guard was placed on the door of the house, commanded by the Irish-Colombian officer Thomas Murray. At this point Hand's horse was shot from under him, and he clambered to his feet dazed from shock. Witnesses agreed that he appeared to be quite drunk as he staggered around. It was at this stage that Hand was either ordered or encouraged by Daniel O'Leary (historians disagree as to the element of Hand's own agency) to &#145;find C&oacute;rdova, and kill him&#146;. Several witnesses watched Hand brush past Murray, enter the house, and ask those present &#145;which one of you is C&oacute;rdova?&#146; When a figure slumped on a wooden box in a corner pointed to his chest and declared &#145;It is I&#146;, Hand plunged his sword once through the injured C&oacute;rdova's chest, and a second time through his upper arm, and then gave him a final blow to the head. He then turned and left C&oacute;rdova to die. The legend that one of the brightest talents of the new Colombian republic had been murdered by a cowardly, drunken foreigner was quickly established, and became a central aspect of the myth of C&oacute;rdova as a national hero.<br>
<br>The sudden nature of Hand's recall to the service, and his previous reputation, led many to believe that he had been specially selected (even trained) by the Colombian government to murder Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a C&oacute;rdova. This impression was given credence in the immediate aftermath of the battle when he was promoted rather than censured, and sent to the Choc&oacute; as provincial governor; from there he continued on to Panama where he was named military governor of Chagres. In 1831, however, with the return to power of the liberals who had opposed Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's government, Hand was arrested and tried for C&oacute;rdova's murder. He spent the next two years in gaol in Cartagena. Many of the other officers from El Santuario had gone into exile, leaving Hand to take responsibility. On the day Hand was sentenced to death, in August 1833, however, the prison guard took an unannounced half-day holiday, and Hand was secreted out of the gaol under the overcoat of the American consul. He fled to the Dutch island of Cura&ccedil;ao.<br>
<br>Hand returned to Venezuela in the mid-1830s. Here he found a receptive cabinet peopled by military veterans, many of whom had served alongside him during the wars of independence. Repeated requests for his extradition to Bogot&aacute; were refused. He applied for and was awarded the job of English teacher in the first Caracas school of the Sociedad de Amigos de Pa&iacute;s, which later evolved into the Universidad Central de Venezuela. On the appointments board for the school was the Colombian general turned British diplomat Daniel O'Leary. During his career as an English teacher&#151;in which he taught many of Venezuela's foremost men of letters&#151;Hand was known for the severe discipline of his classes. He was granted a military invalid's pension by the Venezuelan government. Notorious for his part in the death of Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a C&oacute;rdova, Hand breathed his own last breath in peace and anonymity some time after the pensions department recorded his &#145;very bad health&#146; in July 1846.<br>
