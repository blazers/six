<span class="headword">Venn,  Henry</span>  (1725&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Barnes, Surrey, on 2 March 1725, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28189/', "Richard Venn (1691&#150;1739)")</script>, rector of St Antholin's, Watling Street, London, who was descended from an unbroken succession of clergymen from the time of the Reformation, and Maria Anna Isabella Margaretta Beatrix (<i>d</i>. 1762), daughter of John Ashton. After being educated at several private schools he entered St John's College, Cambridge, in June 1742, but in September he moved to Jesus College, having obtained a Rustat scholarship there. He graduated BA in 1745 and proceeded MA in 1749. In 1747 he was appointed by William Battie to one of the university scholarships that Battie had just founded. Venn was a noted university cricketer, but after playing in a match between Surrey and All England he gave away his bat, apparently because he was to be ordained and did not want to hear, &#145;Well played, Parson!&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 70&#150;71). He was ordained deacon in June 1747 and priest in June 1749, having been elected to a fellowship at Queens' College on 30 March of that year. He also began his ministerial career in 1749 and for a short time combined his college duties with officiating at Barton, Cambridgeshire, Wadenhoe, Northamptonshire, Little Hedingham, Essex, and other local places. He ceased to reside at Cambridge in 1750 and went as curate to Adam Langley, who held the livings of St Matthew, Friday Street, London, and West Horsley, Surrey. He served at St Matthew's during part of the summer and the rest of the year at West Horsley.<br>
<br>At West Horsley, Venn's family prayers were attended by about forty poor neighbours, some of whom he instructed in his home; and the number of communicants increased from twelve to sixty. The local clergy considered him an enthusiast and Methodist, but he continued to hold the strong high-church beliefs of his father, as contained in <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>. At the same time his ministry there gave him time for reading, and he began to doubt the outlook of this book. He was now influenced by another book, William Law's <span class="italic">A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</span>, and he sought to practise its moral and spiritual precepts.<br>
<br>In 1754 Venn became curate of Clapham and was elected lecturer at two London churches&#151;St Alban, Wood Street, and St Swithin London Stone, Cannon Street. The number of sermons required from him led him to learn to preach without reading from a manuscript, and he preached extempore or from short notes for the rest of his life. He had to relinquish his fellowship at Cambridge in 1757, when he married Eling, daughter of Thomas Bishop, minister of the Tower Church, Ipswich. They had one son, John, and four daughters, of whom the eldest, Eling, married Charles Elliott and was the mother of Edward Bishop Elliott and Henry Venn Elliott.<br>
<br>Clapham was already becoming an evangelical centre, and there Venn came under the influence of John Thornton (1720&#150;1790), the banker, who bought the advowson of Clapham, and other early Methodists such as George Whitefield and the countess of Huntingdon. He became closely attached also to John Wesley himself&#151;too closely, thought Samuel Walker (1740&#150;1761)&#151;until about 1758, when he was &#145;brought to believe for himself&#146;  (Sidney, 435). A severe illness in 1756 kept him from work for eight months, but gave him more time for self-examination and consideration upon this matter. During that time he began to write his devotional book <span class="italic">The Complete Duty of Man</span>, which was finally published in 1763. As its title indicates, it was connected with <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>. Venn wished to remedy what he considered were the defects of that book and set out the moral duties required by the evangelical approach. It was a popular book, and twenty editions had been sold by the early years of the next century.<br>
<br>Venn published also in 1760 a sermon on <span class="italic">The Duty of a Parish Priest and the Incomparable Pleasure of a Life Devoted to the Care of Souls</span>, which expressed his attachment to the authority and responsibility of the Anglican ministry. He was determined to remain within the Church of England, and among his objections to the Methodists, he wrote in 1763, was that they &#145;made the ground of their Assurance an inward fleeting instead of the faithfulness of Jehovah, the sensation of a fluctuating heart instead of the unchangeable promises of God&#146;  (G. G. Cragg, <span class="italic">Grimshaw of Haworth</span>, 1947, 71).<br>
<br>In 1759 William Legge, second earl of Dartmouth (1731&#150;1801), who had been converted by Lady Huntingdon, induced Sir John Ramsden, the patron, to appoint Venn as vicar of Huddersfield. In accepting this post he suffered a financial loss. His annual stipend there was only &pound;100, which he found inadequate, even though Lord Dartmouth and John Thornton made further contributions to it. While not yet a factory town, Huddersfield's long-established textile industry was now already expanding sufficiently to make it a large village. The parish covered a wide area inhabited by some 1400 families scattered about the countryside in outlying hamlets and farms. John Wesley went there in October 1757 and wrote, &#145;A wilder people I never saw in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 4.210).<br>
<br>Venn found them &#145;utterly ignorant of the redemption that is in Jesus Christ&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 25), but he gained them by preaching, praying, visiting, and welcoming enquirers in his vicarage. On Sundays at Huddersfield large crowds, many from a distance, soon filled the church to hear his sermons. He sought not only to teach them but also to train them as worshippers and communicants and to understand the prayer book. He twice delivered sermons explaining it, conducted courses of preparation before holy communion, introduced hymn-singing into the service, and catechized the younger members of the congregation. During weekdays he engaged also in open-air preaching and held services in private houses in the hamlets. In a letter written in 1762 to Lady Huntingdon he stated that during that year, apart from Sunday work, he &#145;generally preached eight or ten sermons in the week in distant parts of the parish&#146;  (Ryle). In addition to his parochial activities he accepted invitations from Lady Huntingdon, John Fletcher, and others to preach in various parts of England and south Wales.<br>
<br>Venn's last years at Huddersfield were hard for him. His financial difficulties increased. The upkeep of his family, travelling in his parish and elsewhere, and entertaining the many people who visited him were expensive. The death of his wife in 1767 saddened him and left him in the sole charge of five young children. His intense labours exhausted him and began to affect his health. He showed signs of consumption and was able to preach only once a fortnight, and even then the exertion incapacitated him for several days. In 1771 he was offered the living of Yelling, Huntingdonshire, which he accepted regretfully, saying, &#145;Nothing would have prevailed upon me to leave Huddersfield if my lungs had not received an irreparable injury&#146;  (Elliott-Binns, 323).<br>
<br>In July 1771 Venn married a widow, Catherine Smith (<i>d</i>. 1792), daughter of James Ascough, vicar of Highworth, Wiltshire. At the small village of Yelling he started with a congregation of twenty or thirty, but as his health recovered he achieved a like success there and generally went each year to preach for a few weeks in London. And, since Yelling was only 12 miles from Cambridge, he was visited by many of the younger members of the university, among whom were Charles Simeon, William Faris, Thomas Robinson, and Joseph Jowett. He exerted a strong personal influence upon them and also upon others with whom he engaged in an extensive correspondence. So his importance at Huddersfield, where he gained the first large place outside London for evangelicalism and became known as a preacher and writer, was succeeded by his effect at Yelling upon men who became prominent leaders of the movement in the country. After twenty years at Yelling, Venn's health collapsed. In the autumn of 1791 he engaged a permanent curate for the parish and after that seldom officiated in his church or elsewhere, but continued his conversation and writing. Early in 1797 he left Yelling and went to Clapham, where his son John was now rector. He died at Clapham on 24 June 1797 and was buried in the old churchyard.<br>
<br>Like most evangelicals, Venn was a moderate Calvinist. He wrote in 1775, &#145;Though the doctrines of Grace are clear to me, I am still no friend to High Calvinism&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 32). After his ordination he adopted a strict manner of life and rarely went to mixed parties, but he was always genial and happy, with, a vicar of Brighton remarked, &#145;a cheerful, open countenance&#146;  (Elliott-Binns, 131). He was a lively and effective preacher. One of his Huddersfield congregation recalled, &#145;When he got warm with his subject, he looked as if he would jump out of his pulpit. He made many weep&#146;  (Ryle, 167). And he was an attractive, sympathetic conversationalist, always ready to assist and advise those who came to him, whether from farm or university.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_28188"></a><span class="headword">John Venn</span>  (1759&#150;1813), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Clapham on 9 March 1759 during his father's curacy there. He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in October 1777, graduated BA in 1781, and proceeded MA in 1784. He was ordained deacon on 22 September 1782 and priest on 26 March 1783, as a curate to his father. He was rector of Little Dunham, Norfolk, from 1783 to 1792, and was the first rector to reside in the parish for seventy-five years. He founded a clerical society, the members of which met twice a year at his rectory to discuss common concerns. He married at Trinity Church, Hull, on 22 October 1789 Catherine, daughter of William King, merchant of Hull; she died on 15 April 1803. They had two surviving sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28185/', "Henry Venn (1796&#150;1873)")</script> and John, for many years vicar of St Peter's, Hereford&#151;and also five daughters, of whom Jane Catherine, the second, married James (afterwards Sir James) Stephen and was mother of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen and of Sir Leslie Stephen. He married secondly Frances, daughter of John Turton of Clapham, in August 1812.<br>
<br>Venn was rector of Clapham from 1792 until his death, and was appointed by the trustees set up under the will of John Thornton. It was during his incumbency that the influential <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42140', "Clapham Sect")</script> developed, and its members followed him as their pastor and spiritual guide. In 1799 he set up the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, which consisted of thirty members, who over tea every month in their houses arranged for visitors to distribute aid in the parish and in 1800 undertook a universal vaccination there. He upheld a strict way of life. In 1796 the inns in the parish had to abolish their skittle-grounds and cease all gaming in their premises; and he wrote about his children, &#145;With respect to parties, they never go to any where cards and dancing are introduced, neither do they learn to dance&#146;  (Hennell, 158). His parishioners' campaign against the slave trade and other religious and philanthropic causes gained his support. A founder and the first chairman of the Church Missionary Society in 1799, he asserted that it was to be conducted &#145;on the Church principle, not the High Church principle&#146;  (Cornish, 47). He shared in the dislike felt by many towards evangelicals at this time. When Hannah More was taken to Clapham in the carriage of Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, with whom she was staying, the coachman was told to put her down at the Bull's Head tavern instead of the rectory.<br>
<br>Venn's earnestness and spiritual fervour found expression in his eloquent and persuasive preaching. In addition, he displayed a cultivated intellect, a composed judgement, and a practical outlook. These qualities enabled him to exert a powerful influence upon his wealthy, notable congregation. He died at Clapham on 1 July 1813. His second wife survived him.<br>
