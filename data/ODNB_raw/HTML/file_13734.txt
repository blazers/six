<span class="headword">Hope family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1700&#150;1813), <span class="occ">merchants and merchant bankers</span>, of Amsterdam and London, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_47892"></a><span class="headword">Archibald [i] Hope</span>  (1664&#150;1743)<span class="occ"></span>. The son of Henry [i] Hope (1630&#150;1688), a merchant of Rotterdam and London, Archibald was baptized in 1664 at the Scottish church in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Although based in Amsterdam he and his family were of Scottish origin and claimed ancestral links to Sir Thomas [i] Hope [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13736/', "Hope, Sir Thomas, of Craighall (1573&#150;1646)")</script>], lord advocate, and the earls of Hopetoun, and were connected through business to the City of London. In the second half of the eighteenth century their merchant bank of Hope &amp; Co. emerged as Europe's most powerful, in particular raising huge sums for kings and governments throughout Europe and beyond to the United States.<br>
<br>Archibald [i] continued his father's business, but experienced greater success. In 1694 he married Anna Claus (<i>d</i>. 1752), daughter of an Amsterdam button maker, and they had at least eight sons and two daughters. In due course Archibald was succeeded in business by his sons Isaac (<i>d</i>. 1766) and Zachary (1711&#150;1770). However, it was his second son, <a name="cosubject_53263"></a><span class="headword">Archibald [ii] Hope</span>  (1698&#150;1733)<span class="occ"></span>, who laid the merchant bank's foundations. In 1720 he became apprenticed to his uncle, an Amsterdam stockjobber, and swiftly got involved in banking business. In 1726 he married a merchant's daughter, Geertruyd Reessen (1702&#150;1726); they had no children.<br>
<br>His brother, <a name="cosubject_59588"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [ii] Hope</span>  (1704&#150;1779)<span class="occ"></span>, joined him about 1724, followed soon after by another brother, <a name="cosubject_48244"></a><span class="headword">Adrian [i] Hope</span>  (1709&#150;1781)<span class="occ"></span>, but Archibald's contribution was cut short by his untimely death in Rotterdam on 28 March 1733. In consequence, the merchant banking house was restyled Thomas and Adrian Hope. These two brothers developed the business so that during the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;62) it became one of Amsterdam's most successful. Thomas married in 1727 Margareta Marcelis, daughter of an Amsterdam merchant and soap boiler, and they had one son, John. Adrian did not marry.<br>
<br>Thomas achieved great commercial influence and overshadowed Adrian. The newly restored stadholder, William IV, appointed him his representative director of the major trading company the West Indische Compagnie, and also to his committee to plan for Dutch economic resurgence. Thomas proposed limited free trade as a stimulus to regeneration, but his plans were cut short by William's death in 1751. He then withdrew from the company but in 1756 joined the more important Oost Indische Compagnie and from 1766 to 1770 represented on its board the new stadholder, William V.<br>
<br>In mid-1762 Thomas and Adrian restyled their firm Hope &amp; Co. and admitted as partners the former's only son, <a name="cosubject_53264"></a><span class="headword">John Hope</span>  (1737&#150;1784)<span class="occ"></span>, and an American nephew, <a name="cosubject_53262"></a><span class="headword">Henry [iii] Hope</span>  (1735&#150;1811)<span class="occ"></span>. Buttressed by his father's wealth and commercial influence, John was destined to play a prominent role in Dutch society and politics and gradually withdrew from the firm's day-to-day management. His marriage in 1763 to Philippina Barbara van der Hoeven (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1789), daughter of Rotterdam's burgomaster, was his first step to membership of the Netherlands' political &eacute;lite. They had at least three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13737/', "Thomas Hope (1769&#150;1831)")</script>, Adrian [ii] (1772&#150;1834), who became insane, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13721/', "Henry Philip Hope (1774&#150;1839)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13737/', "Hope, Thomas (1769&#150;1831)")</script>], a partner of Hopes.<br>
<br>William V arranged for John's membership of Amsterdam's Vroedschap (council) as an alderman from 1768 to 1784, and from the late 1760s through to his death in 1784 he acquired estates and great houses, not least Nederhorst den Berg Castle, near Hilversum. In 1770 he succeeded his father as a director of the Oost Indische Compagnie.<br>
<br>John's American cousin Henry was the son of Henry [ii] Hope, elder brother of Thomas [ii] and Adrian [i] Hope. His father had settled at Boston, Massachusetts, about 1730, and Henry was probably born there. He moved to England about 1748 in order to complete his education. In 1754 young Henry joined Gurnell, Hoare &amp; Co., London merchants, and about 1760 entered the London house of Hope &amp; Co. as a clerk.<br>
<br>From 1762 until the early 1780s these four partners developed Hopes into Europe's leading merchant bank. Adrian and especially Thomas consistently provided over 80 per cent of the capital, largely through the plough-back of profits, and this rose from just over 4 million guilders in 1762 to 10.3 million in 1780. In the process, the Hope partners accumulated great wealth, distributing over 500,000 guilders annually in ten years and under 400,000 in only four.<br>
<br>The Hopes' merchanting business was broadly based, embracing all types of goods traded in markets across Europe and North and Central America. Occasionally they entered into trading speculations of immense size, as in 1787 when they endeavoured, albeit with limited success, to control the international cochineal market. From 1768 the business of financing sovereign clients through the issue of their bearer bonds supplemented the traditional merchanting business and became a major source of prestige. The Hope family's early clients included the kingdom of Sweden, for which 14.5 million guilders was raised in twelve loans between 1768 and 1787; the elector of Bavaria, for whom 400,000 guilders was provided in 1771 on security of his crown jewels; and the republic of Poland, for which 2.6 million guilders was raised in 1772. These were huge sums and were often provided at crucial moments in the histories of these countries. Initially Hopes sought out its clients; by the 1780s, such was their power, the statesmen of Europe beat a path to Hopes.<br>
<br>Henry, &#145;singularly even, mild, engaging and amiable&#146;  (Buist, 16), was the leader in developing this business, benefiting from a neutrality afforded by his American origins. Following Thomas's death in 1779 and Adrian's in 1781, his role became vital and more so when John died unexpectedly in 1784 aged forty-seven. The huge breach their deaths made in Hopes' leadership was never made good. John's sons were then minors but when of age they showed little inclination towards business. For his part, Henry remained a bachelor.<br>
<br>In July 1782 Henry's part-solution was to admit <a name="cosubject_13734"></a><span class="headword">John  Williams Hope</span>  (1757&#150;1813)<span class="occ"></span>. This young Cornishman, born at St Ewe and employed in Hopes' counting house as a clerk, was the son of William Williams, rector of St Ewe, and of Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Gregor of Trewarthenick. He deeply impressed Henry, who encouraged his marriage in 1782 to his heiress, Anne (1763&#150;1820), daughter of his sister Henrietta Maria and her husband, John Goddard of Rotterdam and Woodford Hall, Essex. Williams thereupon changed his surname to Williams Hope and was admitted a partner. John Williams Hope failed to meet expectations, however, excelling as a &#145;desk man&#146; who &#145;ran the office precisely and with pleasure&#146;  (Buist, 17) yet who lacked the dynamism and enterprise which were to be found in his wife. This imbalance of temperament made for a turbulent marriage, culminating in Anne's elopement in 1808 with Baron von Dopff, whom she married in 1813. There were at least two children from the marriage of John Williams Hope and Anne: Henrietta, who married the seventh earl of Athlone, and <a name="cosubject_13740"></a><span class="headword">William Williams Hope</span>  (1802&#150;1855)<span class="occ"></span>. Inheriting a large fortune, W. W. Hope purchased Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire, but spent most of his life in fashionable Paris. A noted eccentric, he was said to possess a magnificent set of diamonds, which he often wore on his own person. Detesting male society, W. W. Hope was also reputed to maintain a coterie of eighteen ladies, distinguished by their musical or artistic attainments. He died at his mansion, 131 rue Dominique, Faubourg St Germain, Paris, on 21 January 1855.<br>
<br>From the 1780s, Henry [iii] Hope reigned supreme over his house, his only rival, from the 1790s, being <a name="cosubject_59587"></a><span class="headword">Pierre C&eacute;sar Labouch&egrave;re</span>  (1772&#150;1839)<span class="occ"></span>. This son of a Huguenot cloth merchant was born at The Hague in 1772 and, after service in his uncle's merchant house at Nantes, joined Hopes as a clerk in 1790; he received procuration three years later although he was not made a partner until 1802.<br>
<br>Throughout the stormy 1780s, when the Netherlands suffered the destructive forces of opposing political factions, more than ever Henry fell back upon his Anglo-American origins. &#145;For not being obliged either by status or duty to take sides&#146;, he reckoned, &#145;I have observed a strict neutrality&#146;  (Buist, 42); he thereby retained his freedom of action. His bond-issuing business prospered. Russia was now the major client; between 1787 and 1793 eighteen bond issues, raising the immense sum of over 50 million guilders, were arranged. A thankful Empress Catherine offered Henry a barony, which he refused. Of his great wealth he made little secret. Much of it was ploughed into his great neo-classical palace of Welgeleegen, Haarlem, built between 1785 and 1790 and based upon the work of Palladio. Henry filled it with great pictures and sculpture; in 1802 he made it over to John Williams Hope.<br>
<br>No protective neutrality was possible following the invasion of the Netherlands by the armies of revolutionary France in 1794. To preserve life and limb from a new terror, the Hopes fled abroad with Henry, Williams Hope, and P. C. Labouch&egrave;re settling in London in 1794. Henry, anticipating a long stay, took a residence in Harley Street, adding a wing to accommodate his 372 pictures, acquired a country seat at East Sheen, and entered into an alliance with the merchant bank of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1382/', "Sir Francis Baring")</script>.<br>
<br>The two houses had done business since the 1760s but now grew closer, with Barings benefiting from use of Hopes' evacuated capital. Their remarkable similarity of outlook was further strengthened when P. C. Labouch&egrave;re married Francis Baring's daughter, Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1771), in 1796. The couple had two sons, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15838/', "Henry Labouchere (1798&#150;1869)")</script>, became a Liberal politician and was ennobled as the first Baron Taunton. Together the houses ploughed &pound;100,000 into land purchases in New England in 1796, arranged a loan for the court of Lisbon in 1802&#151;the proceeds of which were paid as a war levy to Napoleon&#151;and, more importantly, arranged $11.25 million finance for the United States' purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803&#150;4.<br>
<br>Henry Hope, Williams Hope, and Labouch&egrave;re returned to Amsterdam in 1802 to resuscitate Hope &amp; Co., although much of their capital remained in London in the house of Henry Hope &amp; Co. Quickly it recovered its former pre-eminence by continuing the work, begun in London, of funding war levies imposed by France on its enemies and allies alike, in particular Spain and Prussia. Notwithstanding their strong London links, Henry Hope and Labouch&egrave;re did this with the tacit support of Napoleon and his lieutenants such as G. J. Ouvrard; they must be regarded as major financiers of the French wars.<br>
<br>But it was their Indian summer; by 1808 Hopes was a spent force. In that year, spurred on by his unhappy marriage and increasingly at odds with his partners, Williams Hope left to live in England; Henry was now over seventy; Labouch&egrave;re sought early retirement, and died in January 1839; and no Hope children showed interest in succeeding their fathers despite John Hope's heirs' owning much of the capital. Crisis point was reached when Henry died in 1811 and Williams Hope, known simply as John Hope since Henry's death, died two years later, on 12 February 1813 at his home in Harley Street, London. He was buried at St Ewe, Cornwall. The insistence of John Hope's widow on the immediate withdrawal of her husband's capital resulted in Hopes' acquisition by Sir Francis Baring's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1380/', "Alexander Baring")</script>, in 1813. It was the end of a dynasty.<br>
<br>The Hope family had been lured from their business by prospects of prestige and enjoyment to be found elsewhere. The eldest son of John Hope (1737&#150;1784), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13737/', "Thomas Hope (1769&#150;1831)")</script>, an influential figure in English connoisseurship, provides the most telling yet distinguished example. Born at Amsterdam on 30 August 1769, he was the eldest of three brothers who together inherited their father's substantial interest in Hopes but was never active in its management. Instead he turned to the study of classical architecture and civilization and from 1787 spent eight years travelling and studying in Mediterranean countries. In 1795 he settled in London, living in Duchess Street from 1799, and won recognition as an informed scholar, writer, collector, enlightened patron, proponent of neo-classicism, and influencer of taste. He was &#145;entirely devoted to the arts&#146;  (Watkin, 13).<br>
<br>The Hopes, of Scottish descent and with enduring business and cultural links with Britain, were one of Europe's greatest banking dynasties. Their rise during the Seven Years' War and the immense financial power they exercised from then until almost the end of the Napoleonic era were based upon their command of the Amsterdam capital market and their expertise as merchant traders. Their clients included numerous European kings and governments for whom they made bond issues; the finance they provided at vital moments, not least during the Napoleonic wars, influenced international relations. Their accumulation of great wealth enabled their acquisition of estates and works of art as well as their distinguished connoisseurship and patronage; but ultimately this distracted them from their business and undermined its strength.<br>
