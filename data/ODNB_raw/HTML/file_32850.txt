<span class="headword">Dods,  Marcus</span>  (1834&#150;1909), <span class="occ">United Free Church of Scotland minister and biblical scholar</span>, born in Belford vicarage, Northumberland, on 11 April 1834, was the youngest son of the theological writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7753/', "Marcus Dods (1786&#150;1838)")</script> and his wife, Sarah Palliser (<i>d</i>. 1859). On the father's death in 1838 the family moved to Edinburgh, where Dods first attended a preparatory school and then Edinburgh Academy (1843&#150;8). After spending two years in the head office of the National Bank in Edinburgh, he decided in 1850 to study for the ministry of the Free Church of Scotland. In 1854 he graduated MA at Edinburgh University and began his theological course at New College, Edinburgh; during his university career he acted as an assistant in the Signet Library. On 7 September 1858 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Dods had a long probationership: although he preached in twenty-three vacancies, he failed for six years to get a church. During these years of enforced leisure he edited the complete works of Augustine (1871), translated a work by Johann Peter Lange as <span class="italic">Life of Christ</span> (6 vols., 1864), and wrote his popular <span class="italic">The Prayer that Teaches to Pray</span> (1863; 5th edn, 1885) and <span class="italic">Epistles to the Seven Churches</span> (1865). Dods's characteristic humanity and humility emerge in his letters of this period: writing to his sister Marcia regarding Augustine, the &#145;great man&#146; whose works he was then editing, he described Augustine's greatness and reflected on how difficult it is to be merely a &#145;great&#146; and &#145;good little man&#146;. As W. Robertson Nicoll remarked after Dods's death, it was above all this quality that friends, colleagues, and foes admired in Dods: his &#145;natural greatness of soul&#146; coupled with his charming and utterly genuine selflessness and his complete truthfulness.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1864 Dods was installed as minister of the Renfield Free Church, Glasgow; from its pulpit for the next twenty-five years he exercised considerable influence. Among those who benefited from his ministry was Henry Drummond. Sermons delivered at Renfield formed the substance of his popular books: <span class="italic">Israel's Iron Age, or, Sketches from the Period of the Judges</span> (1874; 4th edn, 1880) and <span class="italic">The Parables of Our Lord</span> (1st ser., <span class="roman">Matthew</span>, 1883; 2nd ser., <span class="roman">Luke</span>, 1885). They also provided material for his editions of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> (<span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span>, 1888), of <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> (<span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span>, 1889), and of <span class="roman">St John's gospel</span> (<span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span>, 1897). Dods continued throughout his life to enjoy preaching, which, he wrote, &#145;keeps life sweet&#146;.<br>
<br>Although not a theologian in the technical sense, Dods exhibited wide and exact scholarship and a gift for popularizing new critical views about the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In 1877 Dods published a sermon, <span class="italic">Revelation and Inspiration</span>, which questioned verbal inspiration, the doctrine that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was literally dictated to the writers of scripture by the Holy Spirit. The presbytery of Glasgow, while declining to enter on a judicial process against Dods, advised him to withdraw the sermon until it could be modified. Dods assented on conditions; the matter was brought in 1878 before the general assembly, which declined by a majority to intervene.<br>
<br>In 1869 Dods refused an invitation to become colleague to Robert Smith Candlish at St George's Free Church, Edinburgh, the most influential congregation in the denomination. In 1889, when he celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his ordination, he was appointed to the chair of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> criticism and exegesis in New College, Edinburgh. The appointment implied that the Free Church of Scotland was now prepared to tolerate critical views of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, for which William Robertson Smith had been removed from his chair only eight years before. At the general assembly of 1890 Dods and Alexander Balmain Bruce were charged with teaching doctrines at variance with their church. The assembly, after a protracted debate, acquitted Bruce and, while exhorting Dods to teach the faith held by his church, declined to institute a process which would formally dismiss him on the grounds of heresy. Through his gentleness and reputation for thorough, accurate scholarship Dods contributed enormously to the liberalization of the Free Church: he demonstrated an extraordinary ability to stretch conventional doctrinal boundaries in his theological tradition, while retaining the respect of those who opposed him.<br>
<br>Other books by Dods in his later years included <span class="italic">Mohammed, Buddha, and Christ</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph</span> (1880), <span class="italic">Erasmus and other Essays</span> (1891; 2nd edn, 1892), <span class="italic">An Introduction to the New Testament</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Visions of a Prophet: Studies in Zechariah</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Why be a Christian?</span> (1896), <span class="italic">How to Become Like Christ and other Papers</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">The Bible: its Nature and Origin</span> (Bross lectures, 1905), which provides a full account of his views on inspiration. Two additional volumes of sermons, <span class="italic">Footsteps in the Path of Life</span> and <span class="italic">Christ and Man</span>, were posthumously published in 1909, while his <span class="italic">Early Letters &hellip; (1850&#150;1864)</span> and <span class="italic">Later Letters &hellip; (1895&#150;1909)</span> were edited by his son in 1910 and 1911 respectively.<br>
<br>In 1871 Dods married Catherine, daughter of James Swanston of Marshall Meadows, Berwickshire; the couple had three sons and one daughter, Mary Christian, who later married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102454/', "Arthur Gray")</script>, Presbyterian minister and promotor of marriage guidance. In 1891 he received the honorary degree of DD from Edinburgh University, and in 1901 he declined nomination for the moderatorship of the general assembly of the United Free Church of Scotland (formed in the previous year by the union of the Free and United Presbyterian churches). Appointed in May 1907, on the death of Robert Rainy, principal of New College, Edinburgh, he was prevented by ill health from taking up that office. He died at his home, 23 Great King Street, Edinburgh, on 26 April 1909, and was buried in the Dean cemetery there.<br>
