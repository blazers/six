<span class="headword">Mason,  Thomas</span>  (1579/80&#150;1649?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Hampshire. He claimed to be the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18278/', "Sir John Mason (c.1503&#150;1566)")</script>, sometime member of Queen Elizabeth's privy council. He matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 29 October 1594, aged fourteen, graduated BA on 13 December 1602, and proceeded MA on 12 June 1605. The lengthy gap between the matriculation and the first degree has led some scholars, including Bertha Porter in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, to conclude that the Mason who matriculated and the Mason who collected the degrees were distinct individuals. A fellow of the college between 1603 and 1614, Mason took his BD on 1 December 1613 and was awarded his doctorate the following 18 May.<br>
<br>Mason acquired two Hampshire vicarages, Newton Valence in 1606, and Odiham in 1614. From Odiham he signed the preface to <span class="italic">Christ's Victorie over Sathans Tyrannie</span> (1615), addressed to Sir Edmund Coke and Archbishop Abbot, in which he described himself as &#145;your daily and faithful orator, being a professed soldier under Christ's banner&#146;. In his epistle to the reader, it was estimated on the basis of biblical prophecies that there remained &#145;about 46 years to come until God shall call together the kings of the earth to destroy Rome&#146;. In the meantime, however, a Thomas Mason acquired the rectories of Littleton, Middlesex, on 26 October 1616, North Waltham, Hampshire, in 1623, and Weyhill, Hampshire, in 1624. Mason was resident at Odiham when signing <span class="italic">A Revelation of the Revelation &hellip; whereby the Pope is most Plainely Declared and Proved to be Antichrist</span>, in 1619. Mason was deprived of Odiham in that year.<br>
<br>Mason's later career is difficult to trace, given that there may have been two Masons: a second Mason graduated DD in 1631 from Magdalen College, Oxford, and some of the events following may not belong to the man who was vicar of Odiham. On 25 August 1624, Mason was collated to the Salisbury prebend of Alton Australis (South Alton), and on 7 October 1626 he was elected as the next canon residentiary of Salisbury when a vacancy should arise. However, when the time came another prebend, Humphrey Henchman, was on 28 May 1633 admitted to residence at the request of the dean, Edmund Mason. Thomas Mason and another pre-elected canon, Matthew Nicholas, decided to contest the admission. After a long and complex wrangle, which takes up much space in the state papers of 1633&#150;4, and in which King Charles himself was involved, Henchman's appointment was confirmed, but Mason and Nicholas were to have the next two vacant places. Mason was still in occupation of South Alton on 6 May 1634 but was in residence at the chapter house by 20 November.<br>
<br>In 1646 Mason was ejected by the Wiltshire county committee from his residence; he was charged with having used the rents of the dean and chapter to support the royalist cause. It was alleged that when parliamentarian forces were in Salisbury he refused to preach. Refusing the solemn league and covenant, Mason responded that he would stand for the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> until the day of his death, comparing the parliamentarian cause with the rebellion of Absalom. Thomas Mason, rector of Weyhill, died on 7 November 1649 and was buried at Weyhill. His will was proved on 5 May 1655 by his widow, Elizabeth.<br>
