<span class="headword">Ruge,  Arnold</span>  (1802&#150;1880), <span class="occ">writer and political thinker</span>, was born at Bergen, the main town on the Baltic island of R&uuml;gen, on 13 September 1802. His father was estate manager to Count Brahe. His studies at Halle, Jena, and Heidelberg came to an abrupt end when, charged with complicity in a treasonable conspiracy in 1824 as a result of his involvement in the nationalist student association the Burschenschaft, he was sentenced to fourteen years' imprisonment. However, he was released after six, spent mainly at the fortress of Kolberg where he made good use of his time, studying Plato and the Greek poets. Freed in 1830, he published a translation of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Oedipus at Colonus</span>, as well as a tragedy of his own, <span class="italic">Schill und die Seinen</span>, and soon obtained a teaching post at the Francke'sches P&auml;dagogium at Halle. From 1832 until 1836 he lectured in philosophy at the University of Halle, having established his credentials with his book <span class="italic">Platonische &Auml;sthetik</span> (1832). His first wife, Charlotte D&uuml;ffer, a wealthy young woman, died in 1833 after little more than a year of marriage; in 1834 he married Agnes Wilhelmina Nietzsche. The death of his first wife left him so comfortably provided for that he was able to give up university teaching and devote himself to writing and to the study of Hegelian philosophy.<br>
<br>Ruge became a leading figure in what came to be known as the &#145;Young Hegelian&#146; school. In politics he hoped for the demise of the old feudal regime and the emergence of a bourgeois democratic republic, views which found expression in the <span class="italic">Hallesche Jahrb&uuml;cher f&uuml;r Deutsche Kunst und Wissenschaft</span>, the journal he founded with E. T. Echtermeyer in 1837. This journal soon fell victim to Prussian censorship, so Ruge moved to Dresden in 1841 and refounded it as <span class="italic">Deutsche Jahrb&uuml;cher</span>, but this venture was similarly suppressed, by the Saxon authorities, in 1843. Ruge then moved to Paris where, together with Karl Marx, he founded the <span class="italic">Deutsch-Franz&ouml;sische Jahrb&uuml;cher</span>. His accounts of the politically charged salons and squabbling sects in the French capital, retold also in <span class="italic">Zwei Jahre in Paris</span> (1846), still make interesting reading. His collaboration with Marx was short-lived, for he had little sympathy with Marx's socialistic theories&#151;in 1852 Marx mercilessly satirized him in <span class="italic">Die grossen M&auml;nner des Exils</span>. In 1847 Ruge set himself up as bookseller and publisher at Leipzig. In the revolutionary movement of 1848 he organized the extreme left in the Frankfurt parliament in which he represented Breslau, and for some time he lived in Berlin where he planned to edit a radical democratic newspaper, <span class="italic">Die Reform</span>, which, however, he eventually published from Leipzig. With the collapse of the 1848 revolution he lost his publishing business and his money and was forced into exile.<br>
<br>Through his friend Alexandre-Auguste Ledru-Rollin in Paris, Ruge hoped to establish relations between German and French republicans, but in 1849 both men were forced to flee to London, where they closely associated with other political refugees. Ruge collaborated with Ledru-Rollin, Giuseppe Mazzini, and others in forming a European Democratic Committee, the aim of which was to co-ordinate the work of the bourgeois democratic opposition. However, he soon withdrew and in 1850 went to live in Brighton (he always longed to be near the sea). Here he supported himself by teaching and writing, while his wife, Agnes, ran a daguerreotype business at 180 Western Road, which, however, soon failed in the face of technological advances. From Brighton Ruge maintained regular contact with the coteries of politicking &eacute;migr&eacute;s in London. With a few supporters he founded the Agitation Club in 1851, a rival to Gottfried Kinkel's Emigration Club; Marx, who founded his own group, considered it had as much to do with &#145;agitation&#146; as &#145;a stagnant swamp&#146;  (Ashton, 143). Through a series of lectures to English as well as &eacute;migr&eacute; audiences in London, Brighton, and Birmingham in 1853, published as <span class="italic">New Germany</span> in 1854, Ruge propounded his conviction that, just as German philosophy had revolutionized thought, so too Germany held the key to the future of democracy throughout Europe. He was disappointed to find few converts. Not without reason, it seems, did Marx punningly call him the &#145;Confusius&#146; of German emigration. Yet critical though Ruge was of Britain and bitter at being ignored, he settled happily enough, taking up gardening and enjoying seaside walks. He became a naturalized British subject on 16 July 1855. However, his sense of his own importance led him to believe that, even from a distance, he could still play a role in German politics. Through the columns of the German press, in his manifesto &#145;An die deutsche Nation&#146; (1866) he vigorously supported Prussia against Austria and, in 1870, Prussia against France, and proved a strong advocate of Bismarck's plans for a unified Germany. He approached Bismarck with a request for 120,000 marks in compensation for his publishing business, lost in 1848, but, with the support of his friends, received only 20,000 marks. In 1877 the German government granted him an annual pension (variously reported to be 1000 and 3000 marks) in recognition of his support for German unity. Such recognition meant more to him than the financial reward. When he died, at his home, 7 Park Crescent, Brighton (a house originally rented but purchased in 1867), on 31 December 1880, he left less than &pound;100. He was survived by his second wife, their son, Hermann Arnold Ruge, and their two daughters.<br>
<br>Though in his day a leader in political liberalism, Ruge's work is largely forgotten. In 1846&#150;8 he published ten volumes of his <span class="italic">Gesammelte Schriften</span> at Mannheim. After this time he wrote, among other books, <span class="italic">Unser System</span> (1850), <span class="italic">Revolutionsnovellen</span> (1850), <span class="italic">Die Loge des Humanismus</span> (1851), his memoirs <span class="italic">Aus fr&uuml;herer Zeit</span> (1863&#150;7), and <span class="italic">Die drei V&ouml;lker und die Legitimit&auml;t</span> (1860). He also wrote many poems (published in his <span class="italic">Wanderbuch</span>, 1874), stories (including <span class="italic">Bianca della Rocca</span> under the anagrammatic pseudonym R. Durangelo, 1869), several dramas (including <span class="italic">Die neue Welt</span>, 1856) and romances, and translated various English works into German, including H. L. Bulwer's <span class="italic">Lord Palmerston</span> in 1871, G. H. Lewes's <span class="italic">The History of Philosophy from Thales to Comte</span> (based on the 1867 edition) in 1871&#150;6, and H. T. Buckle's <span class="italic">History of Civilization</span>. His correspondence and diary were published by Paul Nerrlich as <span class="italic">Arnold Ruges Briefwechsel und Tagebuchbl&auml;tter aus den Jahren 1825&#150;1880</span> (1886).<br>
