<span class="headword">Melvin,  James</span>  (1795&#150;1853), <span class="occ">Latin scholar</span>, was born in Aberdeen, of poor parents, on 21 April 1795. He passed through the grammar school a few years after Byron had left it, during Mr Cromar's rectorship, and was the first bursar of his year at Marischal College, whence he graduated AM in 1816. After acting successively as usher at a private school kept by Bisset at Udny, and at Old Aberdeen grammar school under Ewen Maclachlan, he became in 1822 a master at the Aberdeen grammar school, and in 1826 he succeeded Mr Cromar as rector. He also became &#145;lecturer on humanity&#146; (Latin) at Marischal College, and was created LLD by the college in 1834. He formed a wonderful collection of classical and medieval Latin literature (he was said to own a copy of Horace for every day of the year), and became probably the most accomplished Scottish Latinist of his day. He has been identified as one of the last representatives of a distinctive tradition of Scottish Latin scholarship, combining an enthusiasm for classical literature with a deep knowledge of the philology and literature of the Scottish language. He was one of the volunteers who assisted John Jamieson in preparing the two-volume supplement (1825) to his dictionary of the Scottish language. An appreciative account of his teaching and personality was contributed to <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> for January 1864 by a former pupil, Professor David Masson, who compares Melvin as a ruler and inspirer of boys to Thomas Arnold. His method of instruction was minute and punctilious, with a heavy emphasis on philology, but also led his students to a literary appreciation of classical works. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of Latin at Marischal College, first in 1839 when he was defeated by J. S. Blackie in controversial circumstances, and second in 1852. On 18 June 1853 a testimonial in the shape of &pound;300 in a silver snuff-box (souvenir of an inveterate habit) was presented to him by old pupils. Severe application had told upon his health, and he died at his house in Belmont Street, Aberdeen, on 29 June 1853. He was publicly buried in the town churchyard on 5 July.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Latin exercises as dictated by the late James Melvin, LL.D., to which are prefixed dissertations on a variety of Latin idioms and constructions</span>, was published by the Revd Peter Calder, rector of Grantown grammar school, in 1857. A supplementary volume or key appeared in 1858, and a third edition, revised by the Revd J. Pirie, Edinburgh, in 1873. Melvin also wrote for use in his school a Latin grammar, which first appeared in 1822, and passed through three editions, and a number of grammatical &#145;Melviniana&#146; were appended by W. D. Geddes, professor of Greek in Aberdeen University, to his <span class="italic">Principles of Latinity</span> (1860).<br>
<br>Melvin was said to have been long occupied with a large Latin dictionary, but does not appear to have left any materials. His books (6984 in number) were presented to Marischal College in September 1856 by his sister and executor, Agnes Melvin. A stained-glass window was erected in the university library, Aberdeen, representing Melvin in his rectorial robes, in association with George Buchanan (whose Latin versions of the psalms he greatly admired), Arthur Johnston, and Thomas Ruddiman. The device was a beehive and grapes, and the inscription, &#145;Melvinum Natura dedit, gaudete Camenae&#146; (&#145;Nature gave us Melvin&#146;&#151;the name in Latin means &#145;honey-wine&#146;&#151;&#145;Rejoice, Muses&#146;).<br>
