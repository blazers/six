<span class="headword">Logsdail,  William</span>  (1859&#150;1944), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 25 May 1859 at 19 Minster Yard, Lincoln, the fifth of seven children of George Logsdail (1827&#150;1905), verger at Lincoln Cathedral, and his wife, Mary Ann (May), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jessop (1826&#150;1905). From an early age Logsdail was inspired by the architecture of the cathedral and the city of Lincoln, and he spent much of his career painting picturesque buildings and city street scenes. He was educated locally and studied at Lincoln School of Art where his teachers, Edward Richard Taylor and A. W. Webster, created the &#145;School of Lincoln&#146;, whose members included Logsdail and his friend Frank Bramley, later a prominent Newlyn group artist. Logsdail was a precociously talented painter. At seventeen he had four paintings accepted for the annual Royal Academy exhibition, including <span class="italic">His Last Vespers</span>&#151;the image of a dying clergyman based on a scene he had witnessed while sketching in Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Logsdail now moved to London and, unsurprisingly, chose Westminster Abbey as his subject for two new Royal Academy paintings exhibited in 1878. Perhaps discouraged by the limited opportunities for training in the capital, he spent 1878&#150;80 with Frank Bramley at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Beaux-Arts, Antwerp. From 1879 to 1880 he worked directly with Charles Verlat, who developed his appreciation of rich colour, a form of paint application involving bold touches or dabs of pigment, and his skill in composing groups of figures. Logsdail became the first English painter to win a prize at the acad&eacute;mie and his <span class="italic">Fischafslog op de Fischmarkt en Antwerpen</span> (<span class="italic">The Antwerp Fishmarket</span>) (Royal Collection) was acquired by Queen Victoria from the RA exhibition of 1880.<br>
<br>In search of more unusual historical architecture, and inspired by Ruskin's <span class="italic">Stones of Venice</span> (1853), Logsdail moved to Venice in 1881. Here he painted his first large work, <span class="italic">The Piazza of St Mark's, Venice</span> (Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery), which created a sensation at the RA in 1883. With this work he began his lifelong practice of portraying friends in street scenes, with Bramley, Edward Taylor, and Logsdail himself appearing in the crowd that thronged the piazza. He also completed much of the canvas out of doors, in what was then still a relatively unusual method. In 1886&#150;7 he travelled in Egypt, Palestine, and the Balkans, and painted architectural and crowd scenes such as the <span class="italic">Gate of Khalif</span> (1887).<br>
<br>In 1887 Logsdail returned to London where he acquired a studio in Primrose Hill and embarked on the unusual and ambitious series of metropolitan subjects for which he is now best known. These London paintings constitute a distinctive vision of the city in the late 1880s in which he abandoned gothic architecture for bustling modernity. The first in the series, <span class="italic">The Bank</span> (1887, now <span class="italic">The Bank and the Royal Exchange</span>; priv. coll.), portrays the busy intersection by the Royal Exchange, the Bank of England, and the Mansion House. Continuing the practice of depicting friends in his canvases, Logsdail included the artist John William Waterhouse, apparently dozing, in the front row of an omnibus, in which Logsdail also sits (to the rear) in a reciprocal portrait by Waterhouse. For these London paintings Logsdail continued his <i>plein air</i> practice, positioned on cabs and wagons in the middle of his chosen scenes, while for <span class="italic">St Paul's and Ludgate Hill</span> (1887; priv. coll.) he rented rooms with a view from Fleet Street to the cathedral. Other subjects from Logsdail's London series include <span class="italic">St Martin-in-the-Fields</span> (1888; Chantrey bequest, Tate collection), with its juxtaposition of a poor flower girl and wealthy child on the edge of Trafalgar Square; <span class="italic">Sunday in the City</span> (1889), depicting the front portico of St Paul's; and <span class="italic">&#145;So Keep You Cold &hellip;&#146; (The Embankment in Winter)</span>, also 1889, which shows Cleopatra's Needle covered in snow. In 1890 Logsdail also produced a series of images of London landmarks for <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>. Illustrating articles by Thomas Archer entitled &#145;Through London by Omnibus&#146;, his subjects included the Bank of England, the Royal Courts of Justice, and the churches of St Clement Danes and St Mary le Bow.<br>
<br>Logsdail's London pictures culminated in his exceptionally large (6 feet by 9 feet) study of the lord mayor's day parade, <span class="italic">The Ninth of November</span> (Guildhall Art Gallery, London), which received a mixed reception when exhibited at the RA in 1890. The response had a marked effect on Logsdail who now abandoned the series, convinced of its failure. However, two years later <span class="italic">The Ninth of November</span> was published as a plate by the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, suggesting its wider popularity, and it was exhibited in 1893 at the World's Columbian Exhibition, Chicago&#151;where Logsdail was awarded a medal&#151;and again at the People's Palace, east London, in 1897. On 7 May 1892 he married Mary Ann Ashman (1870&#150;1958), daughter of George Ashman, shepherd, of Swaffham, Norfolk; they had a daughter, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1894), and two sons, Edward William (<i>b</i>. 1896) and Stuart (<i>b</i>. 1907).<br>
<br>Following their marriage the couple moved to Venice from where, over the next eight years, Logsdail sent Italian subjects to the RA and other exhibitions. In 1900 he was one of the painters to represent Britain at the Exposition Universelle, Paris. After time in Sicily and Malta, Logsdail and his family returned to London in 1902, where he took lodgings at 5 St Paul's Studios, Talgarth Road, west Kensington. Searching for subject matter at home, he began what he intended to be a series of English cathedrals, and revisited the site of his first works with <span class="italic">Lincoln Cathedral, Exchequer Gate and Castle Square</span> (Usher Art Gallery, Lincoln).<br>
<br>In 1907 Logsdail's career took a new turn when, after exhibiting a painting of his daughter entitled <span class="italic">An Early Victorian</span> (exh. RA, 1907), he was commissioned for a series of portraits, including those of Lord and Lady Halifax, Lord Curzon, the literary editor William Blackwood, and William Wace, dean of Westminster. In 1912 he was elected to the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Ten years later the Logsdails moved to Noke, near Oxford, where William continued to paint portraits, scenes of Oxford, and pictures of flowers and gardens. In a memoir from this period he explained his failure to be elected a fellow of the RA in terms of his modesty, inability to engage in the politics of the art world, and the unwillingness of some fellow artists to promote his case more actively. However, his choice of Antwerp rather than London for his training and his decision to exhibit at the first show of the radical New English Art Club in 1886 also suggest that Logsdail may initially have rejected the idea of the RA as the principal institution by which to gain recognition. This was consistent with his practice of regularly showing new works in Birmingham and Manchester, and in London of preferring the Society of British Artists, the Dudley Gallery, and the RA's main rival, the Grosvenor Gallery. It was also the case that Logsdail's original scenes of modern London did not always find critical favour. That his work was on occasion judged lifeless and mechanical should, however, be set against his attachment to a continental tradition that valued painterly touch over moralizing or sentimental subject matter. His later life, while generally serene, was marked by the death of his elder son during an RAF training flight in 1923. Logsdail himself died of heart failure at the Manor House, Noke, on 3 September 1944, and was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
