<div class="para">
<span class="headword">James,  Eric John Francis</span>, Baron James of Rusholme  (1909&#150;1992), <span class="occ">headmaster and university administrator</span>, was born on 13 April 1909 near Derby, the younger son of Francis William (Frank) James (1865&#150;1945), of Parkstone, Dorset, commercial traveller for wholesale chemists, and his wife, Lilian (Lily) Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of Robert Taylor, of Whitehaven, who was a governess before her marriage. He was educated at Varndean School, Brighton, Taunton's School, Southampton, and Queen's College, Oxford, where he was an exhibitioner and honorary scholar (1927) and Goldsmith's exhibitioner (1929), played chess for the university, and graduated with first-class honours in natural sciences (chemistry) in 1931, and a DPhil in 1933. On 11 April 1939 he married Cordelia Mary Wintour (1912&#150;2007), only daughter of Major-General FitzGerald Wintour, of Broadstone, Dorset. She was an active magistrate and a member of the Home Office advisory panel on the penal system; they had one son, Oliver Francis Wintour (<i>b</i>. 1943), who became professor and head of the department of medicine at Newcastle University.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerineducation"></a>Early career in education</h2>James had hoped to be a surgeon, but limited means led him instead into teaching; he took a temporary post in 1933 at Winchester College, teaching chemistry, and stayed for twelve years. In 1945 he was appointed high master of Manchester grammar school where he remained until 1962. He could have been headmaster of Winchester, but decided that, as an Anglican foundation, it was not suitable for an agnostic. In 1938 he published, with F. Goddard, <span class="italic">Elements of Physical Chemistry</span>, which became the standard school textbook for many years. Among his later publications were <span class="italic">Science and Education</span> (in part) (1942), <span class="italic">An Essay on the Content of Education</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Education and Leadership</span> (1951), and <span class="italic">Plato's Ideas on Art and Education</span> (1974).<br>
<br>At Winchester, James exemplified his own belief that a &#145;scientist should be a man of wide interests in philosophy, literature and the arts&#146;  (personal knowledge) by becoming a &#145;div don&#146; of high repute, that is, taking English, history and divinity; even though an unconcealed agnostic, he was always sympathetic to believers. &#145;Not to have experienced James on the minor prophets&#146;, one pupil said, &#145;is definitely to have missed something&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). &#145;He believed deeply in goodness and the power of reason&#146;  (Derbyshire, memorial address). He inspired intense personal admiration in pupils, many of whom later became Nobel prize-winners, professors, teachers, or captains of industry. Enlightened in his modest home by his father, who was devoted to literature, he believed passionately in the teacher as a cultural force, &#145;opening doors of fulfilment that otherwise pupils could never have attained&#146;  (personal knowledge). One boy spoke of James's &#145;winged words about Jane Austen&#146;  (A. H. Brodhurst, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 June 1992), and another, caught reading a thriller in a chemistry lesson, was told: &#145;If it had been anything decent like Proust, I shouldn't have minded.&#146; The next day, turning back from the blackboard, James found every boy had a volume of the <span class="roman">Zodiac</span> Proust in his hands. As a bachelor he lived in the &#145;rough house&#146; whose brilliant, and often merciless, mimicry of colleagues, led by James's abounding vitality of mind and personality, concealed real affection. In particular he passionately admired Spencer Leeson, the headmaster, and, despite the contrast in their beliefs, based much of his own headmastering on Leeson's example and precepts.<br>
<br>At Manchester grammar school James's influence was much greater, because directed towards staff, parents, and governors as well as pupils. He followed Leeson's advice: providing &#145;spiritual leadership; intellectual distinction; and administrative ability&#151;very definitely in that order&#146;, seeing himself as &#145;<i>primus inter pares</i> and doing a substantial amount of teaching&#146;  (<span class="italic">Spencer Leeson: a Memoir</span>, 76). His tremendous drive, his belief in lofty academic standards, his devotion to, and excitement about, a school which made possible the best education in the world for clever boys irrespective of their backgrounds (&#145;I've got every sort of boy from the sons of mill workers to the sons of company directors&#146;)  (personal knowledge)&#151;all these created a great headmastership, one of the most notable of the twentieth century, comparable to that of Arnold of Rugby in the nineteenth century. He found time for everyone and everything until all the school's activities became imbued with his aspiration for excellence. To many of his staff the Chief &#145;was almost too good to be true. By merely being about the place he brought a vigour to the school which amounted in the course of time to a kind of revolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ulula</span>, 83). Always available for discussion, he never pulled rank; wonderfully easy to get on with, he gave colleagues the impression they were a little bit more than his equal. At the same time he was a natural leader&#151;and an exemplar of his vision of masters' needing not only teaching ability but intellectual distinction. His skilful selection of staff on this assumption was vindicated by seventeen of their number achieving headships&#151;in which he was their most important source of wisdom and guidance as they in turn passed on the invaluable lessons learned under his aegis. For one prot&eacute;g&eacute; the simplest and best was, wherever possible, to respond positively: &#145;Why not?&#146; was a hallmark of his attitude to new ideas.<br>
<br>About parents James was somewhat ambivalent: &#145;one of the most important things a headmaster has to do is to talk to parents about their children&#146; contrasts bizarrely with &#145;given the choice I should prefer to have been the Head of an orphans' school&#146;  (personal knowledge). He spoke clearly about his aims and their responsibilities, expecting the school to achieve the former and parents to fulfil the latter: Manchester grammar school was a ladder giving their sons, from whatever level of society, access to the highest places in the land; and they must play their part, including &#145;selling their (diseducative) TV sets and buying Plato instead&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>As for pupils, some found James distant, even cold and remote, but on others he left an indelible mark, especially those whom he taught chemistry and, memorably, humanities:<blockquote>The supreme reward of being &hellip; at MGS was to be taught by Eric James &hellip; This Fabian agnostic took upon himself the Religious Instruction of the Sixth Form. What we got was an awesome trip through the history of Western Thought, after a thoroughgoing grounding in Platonism, the &#145;Chief&#146; bemoaning the while his ignorance of Classical Greek. (<span class="italic">Ulula</span>, 83)</blockquote>One boy, asked by the Chief what he was doing alone near the library, said: &#145;Thinking, Sir&#146;. The cold voice changed instantly: &#145;Good. Forgive the intrusion&#146;  (ibid.). The same pupil wrote: &#145;I do not miss him. What he was, in the effect he had on the boys of his High Mastership, and what they have passed on to the world, he still is and will be. He gave us our selves&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>James's objectives and achievements were clear and pursued relentlessly: scholarship should be an enduring source of satisfaction; equality of opportunity depends not on the ability to pay but on the ability to learn; since clever boys are not little swots but more, not less, likely to be good at other things, the school must give them every opening, including art, music, drama, games, and &#145;outward Bound-ery&#146;, in which Manchester grammar school excelled, with its treks and camps and outdoor centre at Disley. Where some immovable obstacle prevented swift action, as in the development of music, he had the patience to say: &#145;Where there's death there's hope&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>James was a member of the University Grants Committee (1949&#150;59) (a very unusual honour for a headmaster at that time), of the BBC's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script> (in the 1950s), of the Central Advisory Council for Education (1957&#150;61), and of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries (1958&#150;61), and was chairman of the Headmasters' Conference from 1953 to 1955. His contribution to education was nationally recognized in 1956 when he was knighted, and again in 1959 when he was created a life peer, as Baron James of Rusholme. In the House of Lords as a cross-bencher he amply justified these honours by the vigorous part he played in debates relating to those fields where his knowledge and judgement would have full effect.<h2>
<a name="CreatingtheUniversityofYork"></a>Creating the University of York</h2>In 1962 James left Manchester grammar school to become vice-chancellor of the newly founded University of York. He remained there until his retirement in 1973. York offered new challenges, and by meeting them James created one of the best post-war institutions of higher learning. While he may have run Manchester grammar school as if it were a university, he confessed he could not run York University as if it were a school. First it had to be built, and James played a major role in the architectural plan. Like J. H. Newman he felt its purpose was to help students to think clearly, to confront the perennial problems of human experience, to discuss and evaluate new and difficult ideas, which could often be better achieved by apparently remote than so-called relevant subjects. The buildings therefore had to express the university's total function as a small collegiate campus with a distinctive character: a community of scholars seeking excellence and maintaining tough academic standards; halls of residence as the centre of social and academic life, with a significant element of tutorial teaching and pastoral care; quality of teaching, rather than research, in a limited range rather than a multiplicity of disciplines. The architects regarded James as the perfect client: with the registrar, John West-Taylor, he and they in a rare creative collaboration hammered out the designs for a community in which the physical, social, and intellectual environments were one. James's particular satisfaction was the introduction of a lake, opening out and holding together the whole campus.<br>
<br>Apart from the buildings, how did this man with a dream turn it into reality? By getting good men on the staff, by creating the kind of place where schools sent their best pupils, and by giving them all leadership and unstinted support&#151;&#145;miles of rope&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). &#145;He worked best with and through others&#146;  (Derbyshire, memorial address). James made imaginative appointments such as Harry R&eacute;e, Alan Peacock, Patrick Nuttgens, Philip Brockbank, and Wilfred Mellers, for whom the early years at York were the &#145;best time of our professional lives&#146;  (ibid.). He wanted open access for applicants who could benefit from what York offered: &#145;Jude the Obscure need no longer look despairingly at the spires of an inaccessible university, provided he has three good A Levels &hellip; and is prepared, if necessary, to do without spires&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Students could never claim he was out of touch; those who rejected his pipe-smoking paternalism, and even the International Socialists in 1968 and after, still admired him as always ready to talk, with glasses of Tio Pepe at the ready. His brilliant talents as a chairman, with relieving gifts of humour, held the university together, reconciling, or at least accommodating, conflicting opinions. Above all (and despite giving the impression that he did not care about ordinary people&#151;&#145;I do, only I can't go round saying &#147;I care&#148;&#146;) &#145;he cared profoundly for us all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ulula</span>, 83).<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>Beyond Manchester grammar school and York, James's influence was no less considerable. In the Headmasters' Conference he carried great weight: as chairman, conducting business with outstanding ability and dispatch; as a member, intervening with balanced judgement and common sense. He once flattened in one sentence those who pleaded for the retention of Latin for Oxbridge entrance: &#145;I cannot believe the whole future of Western civilisation depends upon O level Latin&#146;  (personal knowledge). He was a tireless champion of day and direct grant schools. He was an apostle of excellence and an unashamed &eacute;litist in an egalitarian age, and many responded gladly to his defence of Plato's ideal of an aristocracy of talent. He believed that in matters of the intellect and in judgements of value the idea of equality was irrelevant, and he led his grammar school colleagues in the battle for academic standards and selection against the proponents of comprehensive schooling. As a Fabian socialist he did believe in equality of opportunity, but felt that the Labour Party had betrayed its own ideals and experience by destroying the grammar schools while leaving the private schools untouched; many of its leaders had themselves benefited from the direct grant system, which offered opportunity without reference to financial background. Ultimately his campaign failed, and comprehensive schools mostly won the day; even his hopes of keeping a few highly selective schools open to the exceptionally gifted child regardless of financial circumstances were dashed.<br>
<br>Among his fellow vice-chancellors James also found himself in a minority from time to time: while as a former member of the University Grants Committee he had no fears for university freedom from the government's auditing of university finances, his &eacute;litist aim to preserve the universities from narrow vocational studies failed. However his 1971 report <span class="italic">The Education and Training of Teachers</span>, which resulted from his chairmanship of the committee to inquire into the training of teachers (1970&#150;71), won wide acclaim, introducing academic as well as vocational courses and regular in-service training for life: teaching became an all graduate profession, giving practising teachers more opportunity to take responsibility for young recruits. James served also as a member of the Press Council (1963&#150;7) and of the Social Science Research Council (1965&#150;8), and as chairman of the Personal Social Services Council (1973&#150;6). He was a fellow of Winchester College (1963&#150;9), an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1979), and was awarded honorary degrees by McGill (1957), York (Toronto) (1970), New Brunswick (1974), and York (1974).<br>
<br>As a scientist and an aesthete James was deeply knowledgeable and passionate about alpine plants, and an enthusiastic patron of musicians and artists: the Jameses' gardens were each a miniature botanics; for many in Manchester, to visit the Jameses' house was to discover modern art for the first time; in York he and Lord Harewood introduced the idea of resident musicians (the Amadeus Quartet, paid for by Sidney Bernstein, Rostropovich, and others) and he brought Herbert Read and Henry Moore&#151;and some of the latter's works&#151;to the campus; through the Royal Fine Arts Commission (which he described as the most civilized body he had ever sat on)  (S. Cantacuzino, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 May 1992), of which he was a member from 1973 to 1976, and chairman from 1976 to 1979, he had a national influence.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>James was remarkable in combining a wonderfully unstuffy and relaxed style with speed of thought and work, ruthless clarity in decision making with insistence on balanced debate, a generous approachability with intolerance of the pretentious and self-important, a commanding intellect with encouragement and freedom for those who worked with him, unwillingness to suffer fools gladly with patience for the vulnerable, the weak and the sincerely simple, and a dominant personality with charming, self-deprecating humour, as much at ease with women as with men. He believed &#145;the supreme reward of teaching is to realise one is teaching a boy more intelligent than oneself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ulula</span>, 83), just as he found great pleasure in being forced, by intellectual ingenuity and persistence, to change his mind. Equally, an idea he did not believe in could be deftly sidestepped, as when a government inspector advised that a master should supervise the playground: &#145;An excellent idea,&#146; he said. &#145;I'll pass it on to my successor&#146;  (personal knowledge). A swift stalker of corridors, he could still put an extraordinary variety of individuals at ease by giving them the impression of time and availability in the comfort of his study. Beneath words of wit there was a will of iron; and behind strong leadership there was willingness to trust and delegate without stint or caveat, so that failure to reciprocate caused him deep hurt. He was very human&#151;so that he delighted in the company of children, for whom he always had a sweet at the ready in his waistcoat pocket&#151;and working with him was great fun. He and his wife, Cordelia, were incomparable hosts, and the cleverer the visitors, the quicker his repartee, the more sparkling his mimicry, and the apter their quotations.<br>
<br>Of medium height, with a small head (going bald on top), piercing blue eyes, a narrow face, sharp and mobile features, and a pipe usually in his mouth, often upside down and readily taken out to emphasize a point with expressive gestures, James was quick to speak and laugh, positive and enthusiastic in his quicksilver responses to others' talk, yet always with an air of meaning business behind his relaxation and ease. Even a sidelong glance from him carried great weight. His oft-imitated voice imbued everything he said with the sense of a rich, confident, and rounded personality. Latterly, loss of sight and lameness afflicted him. His death followed a head injury incurred after stumbling at his home, Penhill Cottage, West Witton, Leyburn, Yorkshire. Despite surgery he died three days after the accident, on 16 May 1992, in Darlington. He was cremated in Darlington on 23 May and his ashes buried in West Witton. He was survived by his wife and son. A celebration of his life was held at York University on 5 October 1992.<br>
