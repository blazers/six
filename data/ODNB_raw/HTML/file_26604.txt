<span class="headword">Stotherd,  Richard Hugh</span>  (1828&#150;1895), <span class="occ">army officer and surveyor</span>, son of General Richard J. Stotherd (1796&#150;1879), colonel-commandant Royal Engineers, and his first wife, Elizabeth Sydney (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of Hugh Boyle, of Dungiven, co. Londonderry, was born at Angler Castle, co. Tyrone, on 25 November 1828. His father, who came of a Lincolnshire family, was long employed on the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.<br>
<br>Educated at University College School, London, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Stotherd was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 2 May 1847, and first lieutenant on 28 October. He trained at Chatham, and then served at Woolwich and Gibraltar, and on his return home was posted to the Ordnance Survey and sent to Dumfries. He was promoted second captain on 21 May 1855, and first captain on 17 May 1860. In 1861 he left the survey and on 11 June that year married at St George's, Hanover Square, London, Caroline Frances Wood (<i>d</i>. 17 Feb 1872), with whom he had several children. After the seizure by US forces of the <i>Trent</i> in November 1861 Stotherd went to North America, where he acted as brigade major and assistant to the commanding royal engineer in preparing for a possible American attack on Canada. He was commended for his services during the four years he served in Canada and New Brunswick.<br>
<br>On his return to England on 13 February 1866 Stotherd was appointed instructor at Chatham, teaching electricity, chemistry, signalling, and photography. He investigated the application of electricity to mining and to submarine mining (then in its infancy), and also organized the first field telegraph. In 1867 he was sent to the Paris Exhibition to report on military telegraph apparatus and engineering exhibits. He was greatly interested in signalling and was instrumental in introducing Morse code in the army. He was promoted brevet major on 22 November 1870, regimental major on 5 July 1872, and regimental lieutenant-colonel on 3 August 1872. In 1871 he went with Colonel C. C. Chesney to report on the Franco-Prussian War and the siege of Paris by Marshal MacMahon during the commune. In April 1873 he was appointed to the War Office in London, to advise on submarine mines and military telegraphs, and from 1873 to 1876 he was president of the first War Office torpedo committee. On 29 September 1875, at Edinburgh, Stotherd married Elizabeth Janet Melville. From 1876 to 1881 Stotherd was commanding royal engineer of the Belfast military district. He was promoted brevet colonel on 3 August 1877, and regimental colonel on 26 April 1882. In September 1881 he was put in charge of the Ordnance Survey in Ireland, living at Mountjoy barracks, Phoenix Park, Dublin, and after the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish, in 1882, he was also military justice of the peace for Dublin.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1883 Stotherd was appointed director-general of the Ordnance Survey and went to its headquarters at Southampton, where he found a staff, recently doubled in number, working to meet the recommendation of the parliamentary select committee of 1878 that, in order to make more efficient the transfer of title to land, the 1:2500 cadastral surveys should be completed in 1890, instead of 1900 as originally planned. Stotherd argued for the retention of a large military staff at the survey during peacetime and for military superintendence of the civil staff. His views held sway, but failed to address the fundamental problems of civilians within the survey. He also successfully argued for systematic revision of survey maps on which work began in 1886. Unfortunately his advice that 1:2500 maps could not be satisfactorily produced by replotting from 6 inch field books without considerable resurveying was ignored, and the revision exercise proved one of the survey's worst errors. During Stotherd's tenure, but against his advice, Stanford's were made sole agents for survey maps in England and Wales. In 1884 under Stotherd's direction half a million maps were prepared in very short time for the Parliamentary Boundary Commission to effect Gladstone's Redistribution of Seats Bill of 1885. Stotherd was made a CB in recognition of this service. In his last year at the survey he introduced powerful electric light to aid photographic reproduction of maps; new steam printing presses also helped reproduction. On 25 November 1886 he was compelled by the age rule to retire, receiving the honorary rank of major-general. He died suddenly, from heart disease, on 1 May 1895 at Heathcote, Camberley, Surrey; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Stotherd contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers</span> (vols. 17 and 18) and his <span class="italic">Notes on Defence by Submarine Mines</span> (2nd edn, 1873) was the first English textbook on the subject. He was an unremarkable director-general of the survey: he was not a distinguished scientist and his short tenure of the post gave little scope for the exercise of organizational skills. His early forced retirement increased instability in the survey.<br>
