<span class="headword">Lloyd,  John</span>  (1833&#150;1915), <span class="occ">municipal reformer and antiquary</span>, was born at Dinas, Brecon, on 3 September 1833, the youngest of the three sons of John Lloyd (1797&#150;1875), landowner, local historian, and poet, and his first wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yeats. He was educated at Brecon College School&#151;&#145;at that time practically in ruins&#146;, as he later recalled  (<span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span>)&#151;and at Bridgnorth grammar school under the headmastership of Thomas Rowley. In 1851 he was admitted to St John's College, Oxford, with a view to his entering the church, but he left without a degree, returning to Wales to act as agent for his father's estates. He spent his early adulthood in estate management, planting extensive woodlands on his father's Llanwrtyd Wells land and &#145;cultivating&#146; the Usk to turn it into a fertile salmon fishing river. In 1865 he married Elizabeth Anna (1836/7&#150;1915), daughter of Charles Griffiths, rector of Talach-ddu, Brecknockshire. They settled at Huntington Court in Herefordshire.<br>
<br>Lloyd's life changed with the death of his father in 1875, after which his eldest brother took over the management of the family estate and Lloyd moved to London to study law at the Middle Temple, being called to the bar in 1877. London was new to him: he had visited the capital only for the duke of Wellington's funeral in 1852 and, occasionally, to play cricket (a sport at which Lloyd was more than proficient, once scoring 86 in a day-long partnership with W. G. Grace, when the latter scored his first century), but, as he later remembered, &#145;during my progress at the bar I found time to study the history of London&#146;. Lloyd had been sensitized by his father to a mode of history which emphasized the ceaseless struggle of the people to assert their rights and liberties against the depredations of privilege. He considered his father's &#145;heroic&#146; poem on the death of John Hampden to be &#145;one of the best &hellip; he ever wrote&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brecon and Radnor Express</span>, 23 August 1913). His self-immersion in London's past alerted him to intrusions upon Londoners' civic rights less dramatic, perhaps, than those against which Hampden had fought, but irksome none the less.<br>
<br>Lloyd made himself the campaigning adversary of the City of London corporation, the monopoly public utility companies of London, and, above all, the capital's ground landlords. His resentment of the denial of access to Lincoln's Inn Fields to the general public prompted him to place an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in October 1880 calling for the formation of an association to lobby for London's municipal emancipation. The London Municipal Reform League was formed in March 1881 and, under the direction of Joseph Firth, galvanized the movement for metropolitan reform. The league succeeded in pushing its cause up the agenda of the second Gladstone government, which introduced an unsuccessful bill for a metropolitan municipality in 1884, though its claims to have influenced the eventual county government reform passed by Salisbury's Unionist government in 1888 carry less weight. The league did, though, provide several members of the Progressive (liberal-radical) majority on the new London county council in January 1889: Lloyd claimed that two-thirds of the members of the first council were members of his league or &#145;in close touch and sympathy with the movement&#146;  (J. Lloyd, <span class="italic">London Municipal Government: History of a Great Reform, 1880&#150;1888</span>, 1910, 72). They included Lloyd himself, elected as councillor for North Kensington. His programme illustrated Sidney Webb's dictum that a course of lessons in the law of rent would turn a mere radical into something like a socialist.<br>
<br>Lloyd translated his inherited rural radicalism into a comprehensive hostility towards all who stood between the Londoner and his civic entitlement. He advocated municipal control of gas and water, reform of the City corporation and guilds, improved working-class housing, pensions for the aged poor, reform of the poor law and hospitals, and licensing reform. His advocacy of pensions reflected his involvement, since 1880, with the National Provident Association (Lloyd had been an early supporter of Canon William Blackley's old-age pension proposals), but the remainder of his programme embodied the core principles of London Progressive policy. Lloyd proved to be an assiduous councillor, claiming to have missed only four of 242 meetings of the second council (1892&#150;5), and to have endured over 1000 committee meetings in that period  (<span class="italic">Paddington, Kensington and Bayswater Chronicle</span>). He was apparently, though, not an easy colleague. Sir Harry Haward, appointed comptroller of the council in 1893, remembered Lloyd as &#145;a tough fighter with a not too pleasant tongue&#146; and &#145;a cantankerous disposition&#146;  (Haward, 13, 80).<br>
<br>Whether or not for this reason, Lloyd never really figured in the council's ruling inner circle. He remained instead an awkward back-bencher, making life difficult for the patrician first chairman of the finance committee, Lord Lingen, and continuing his own private conflict with London's landlords. The most durable product of that conflict was his success in initiating, and inducing the council to continue, a survey of London's ground landlords. He began work on this in 1892 by marking out the larger estates on a 25 inch Ordnance Survey map of London, and the council eventually completed it in 1910. He became, also, something of a brake on the Progressive wheel, in his repeated attempts to delay municipal expenditure until rating reform transferred some of the burden of local taxation to the ground landlord, notably in the case of his attempt to impede the acquisition of Hackney Marshes. He was in fact in full sympathy with Progressive objectives, but he began to fear that the council's enhanced radicalism might lose him support in a West End constituency, albeit one with a large working-class component. In 1895 he campaigned disingenuously on the claim that he was &#145;entirely independent of imperial party politics&#146;  (election addresses, National Liberal Club collection) and called for only judicious use of direct labour in the council's operations, but this did not save him from defeat in that year's elections, which saw a strong Conservative swing. He just failed to benefit from the strong swing to the Progressives in 1898, falling only twenty-eight votes short of the second Conservative candidate, a defeat that marked the end of his municipal career.<br>
<br>Lloyd continued to live in North Kensington, with two servants from Brecknockshire, but the remainder of his life was devoted to the study of his Welsh roots. He became, as Edwin Davies of Brecon recounted after his death, &#145;a diligent student at the [Public] Record Office, the British Museum, and at other places where papers relating to Breconshire were stored&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brecon and Radnor Express</span>, 24 June 1915). He published <span class="italic">Historical Memoranda of Breconshire</span> in two volumes in 1903 and 1904, and <span class="italic">The Great Forest of Breconshire</span> in 1905. Lloyd collated the papers of Henry Maybery, the Brecon attorney engaged by several of the early south Welsh ironmasters, and published <span class="italic">The Early History of the Old South Wales Ironworks</span> in 1906. He applied his antiquarianism, characteristically, to protect 600 acres of common land on the Buckland estate from enclosure, proving &#145;from a document in his possession that the steward of the manor was steward under the Crown 100 years previously and that the land in question was therefore clearly common land&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brecon and Radnor Express</span>, 17 June 1915). He inferred from such triumphs that &#145;the Welsh people [should] not remain in ignorance. They did not know their own rights and privileges and yet the information was all before them in the old documents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brecon and Radnor Express</span>, 6 November 1913). His last project was to raise funds for a public library in Brecon, which he envisaged as &#145;a place where the young men could meet who were found in such numbers in the streets&#146;  (letter from Francis Draper, <span class="italic">Star</span>, 12 June 1915). It remained unrealized at the time of his death, in a nursing home at 4 and 5 Dorset Square, London, on 6 June 1915. He was buried at Talach-ddu on 10 June.<br>
