<span class="headword">Elliot,  Launceston</span>  (1874&#150;1930), <span class="occ">weightlifter and strongman</span>, was conceived in Launceston, Tasmania (hence his first name), but born in Bombay, India, on 9 July 1874, the first son of Gilbert Wray Elliot (1833&#150;1910), who was from 1853 to 1877 an official in the Bombay covenanted civil service and who had two children from two previous marriages, and his Scottish third wife, Ann (1850/51&#150;1939), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mason, whom he met in Australia. His great-grandfather was Hugh Elliot (1752&#150;1830), governor of Madras and brother of the first earl of Minto, and his grandfather was Admiral Sir Charles Elliot (1801&#150;1875), governor of St Helena.<br>
<br>In 1887 Gilbert Elliot moved his family to England to take up farming, and settled at Highfield, High Road, Mottingham, Kent. There the well-built Launceston, who attended school at least until the age of sixteen, came under the tutelage of Eugen Sandow, father of modern bodybuilding, and in 1891 he first entered the British weightlifting championships held at the fashionable Caf&eacute; Monico in London's Piccadilly. Although unsuccessful on that occasion, three years later he won the British title at the Royal Aquarium, Westminster, in an event decided on aggregate poundage over eight different types of lift.<br>
<br>In April 1896 Elliot added an Olympic title for raising 71 kg in the one-handed lift at the inaugural modern Olympic games in Athens. He also came second in the two-handed lift, equalling the weight lifted by the winner, Viggo Jensen of Denmark, but losing because of what one judge, Prince George of Greece, deemed an inferior style as he moved one of his feet during the lift. Having, like all the British competitors, paid his own way, Elliot opted to participate in several other events, thus becoming one of only three athletes who have competed in four different Olympic sports. He gained fourth place in the heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestling but lost in the heats of the 14 metre rope climb and the 100 metres. As the latter were held on the opening day of the games, he was among the first of Britain's Olympians.<br>
<br>In 1898 Elliot won the first British physique contest not held in conjunction with a weightlifting tournament. He also participated regularly in Cumberland and Westmorland, Greco-Roman, and catch-as-catch-can forms of wrestling. He continued with his weightlifting and in 1898 set a new world record for the single-handed lift. According to some accounts, he competed in the Paris Olympics, held in 1900, but this time, as there was no weightlifting event, in the discus, where he was placed eleventh.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Elliot opted to become a professional strongman on the music hall circuit. According to family legend this was because his father had played the stock market and lost so much that he had to sell a farm that he had promised to his son on the latter's marriage, in 1897, to Rose Emilia Kathleen (1873&#150;1945), daughter of Francis William Helder, vicar of St Mildred's, Lee, in Kent. They had three daughters who, after father and son were reconciled, often stayed with Elliot's father in Mottingham, while Elliot toured with his troupe in Britain and on the continent.<br>
<br>Elliot and his exhibition partner, Montague Spencer, an old weightlifting colleague, would engage in mock gladiatorial contests using weapons of the arena. His personal act usually began with Elliot adopting muscular poses in imitation of classical statues. He then moved from exhibiting his physique&#151;at his prime he stood at 6 foot 2 inches, weighed 224 pounds and had a chest measurement of 54 inches&#151;to demonstrating his strength, usually by the lifting of humans rather than iron weights. The highlight was the bicycle spin in which he supported a long metal pole across his shoulders from which, at each end, was suspended a bicycle and rider. With this load Elliot would start revolving, slowly at first, but finally at such a speed that the riders would be swung into a horizontal position, often circling over the orchestral pit in the theatres. His entourage included four black and four white bodybuilders, dressed respectively in leopard skins and togas, and at each venue he also employed eight well-built local bodybuilders who wore sailor suits. Ultimately all sixteen men would be supported in pyramid fashion on Elliot's broad shoulders.<br>
<br>Although Elliot opted not to tour so much after the First World War, he did venture to South America in the early 1920s. However, following the death of his youngest daughter, Constance Joan, in December 1923 he emigrated to Australia, settling in Whittlesea near Melbourne. He died there on 8 August 1930, after failing to recover from an operation for cancer of the spine, and was buried in Fawker cemetery. Although he is not known to have lived or even competed in Scotland, his Scottish lineage served to have him inducted into the Scottish sporting hall of fame in 2002 as that nation's first Olympic gold medallist.<br>
