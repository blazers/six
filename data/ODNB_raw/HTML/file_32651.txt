<span class="headword">Crozier,  William Percival</span>  (1879&#150;1944), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Stanhope, co. Durham, on 1 August 1879, the youngest son of the Revd Richard Crozier, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Hallimond. He was educated at Manchester grammar school and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship and obtained firsts in classical moderations (1900) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1902). A year teaching at Knaresborough persuaded him that he was not cut out to be a schoolmaster. Diverted to journalism, he joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> for a few months, and then the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (1903). He made an impression immediately with his sharply critical analysis of the case for tariff reform. Sooner than most he won his editor's confidence and became C. P. Scott's right-hand man in charge of news gathering and the newspaper's make-up. In 1906 Crozier married Gladys Florence, daughter of George Frederick Baker, draper and furnisher, of Maidstone. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Years before he became editor, Crozier reorganized the foreign news service; dramatically increased the use of photographic illustrations and maps; even succeeded in introducing classification. He encouraged new features, though some, like the women's page (1922), with more reluctance than others. He encouraged contributions on a wide range of sporting activity, while the arts columns gave critical coverage to the cinema (or kinema, as Scott preferred) and broadcasting. In 1929 he introduced the daily crossword. It was due to Crozier more than any other that &#145;the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> was transformed from a provincial organ of opinion into a national newspaper pre-eminent also for its news&#146;  (Taylor, xix&#150;xx).<br>
<br>With his friend and older colleague Herbert Sidebotham Crozier shared a devotion and commitment to Zionism. He became the leading advocate in the daily press of a Jewish national home. His Zionism was &#145;a secular but profound fulfilment of his strongly scriptural imagination&#146;  (Ayerst, 383). He succeeded Sidebotham as news editor in 1912, and in 1918 as military critic. This last he undertook, as all his tasks, with thoroughness and energy, but he lacked his predecessor's flair. In 1919 he was offered, but declined, the editorship of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. Determined not to repeat the earlier mistake that had cost him Sidebotham's services, Scott made Crozier a member of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>'s board. Ted Scott's tragic accidental death in April 1932 sundered the dynastic succession, and Crozier was appointed editor. His choice seemed to offer some guarantee of continuity for he had served a long and faithful apprenticeship to C. P. Scott. As chairman of the board, John Scott ensured that the tradition of editorial precedence and independence was respected and maintained.<br>
<br>As editor, Crozier remained to an extraordinary extent what he had always been, &#145;a working journalist of something approaching genius&#146;  (Wadsworth, 232). He was distinguished by the close control he exercised over the paper. He frequently contributed leaders. His own style of writing was clear and precise. He persistently, if gently, censured the use of jargon and verbiage, extolling the virtues of writing that was &#145;simple, direct, lucid, concise and brief &hellip; the best and most effective English for newspaper purposes&#146;  (Ayerst, 197). He was as dedicated a Liberal as C. P. Scott, but Westminster was neither a favoured nor a familiar milieu. He was saved from engagement in debilitating domestic political disputes by an overwhelmingly more important issue of foreign politics. His editorship spanned the dozen years from Hitler's assumption of power to the last months before the allied invasion of Europe. No other English editor was better informed about the true nature of German national socialism. His reserved, sceptical manner masked his passionate loathing for the cruelties perpetrated by the Nazi regime. As foreign editor he had always been unduly possessive about foreign news, to the considerable irritation and exasperation of his correspondents. Now he considered it no less than his duty personally and persistently to expose the Nazis. Although he frequently asserted the contrary, he was reluctant to surrender any part of his crusade even though it undermined his frail health. He was not stopped by a perforated ulcer in 1936, any more than by the diagnosis, in 1943, of his ultimately fatal heart condition. He worked to the end.<br>
<br>A father's over-zealous Methodism had induced in Crozier a reluctant agnosticism. Nevertheless, the scholar&#150;journalist maintained his biblical and classical studies. They informed the two works of historical fiction he wrote in the scanty leisure time he allowed himself: <span class="italic">Letters of Pontius Pilate</span> (1928), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Fates are Laughing</span> (1945). He contributed a fascinating character sketch of C. P. Scott to J. L. Hammond's biography of the editor whose name is synonymous with the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (1934). Crozier died at his home, 23 Anson Road, Victoria Park, Manchester, on 16 April 1944. He was survived by his wife.<br>
