<span class="headword">Bradbury,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1643, <em>d.</em> 1696), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 28 August 1643, the eldest son of Henry Bradbury of St Martin's Fields, Middlesex, and Barbara Carew. He was admitted to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1659, and entered the Middle Temple on 28 June 1660. He received an MA on 28 September 1663 and was called to the bar on 17 May 1667. For some time his practice in court was inconsiderable. He is first listed as junior counsel on 3 June 1684 against Lady Ivy in a suit in which she asserted her title to lands in Shadwell. The deeds on which she relied were of doubtful authenticity, and Bradbury won commendation from Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys for pointing out that the deeds described Philip and Mary by a title which they did not assume until some years after the date which the deeds bore. When Bradbury repeated his comment, Jeffreys responded: &#145;Lord, sir! you must be cackling too; we told you your objection was very ingenious, but that must not make you troublesome. You cannot lay an egg but you must be cackling over it&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 7.311). Bradbury's name next occurs in 1681, when he was a trustee, along with the earl of Shrewsbury and Hon. Charles Bertie, of the marriage settlement of one of the Carys of Tor Abbey.<br>
<br>Bradbury may have been an intermediary used by the conspirators involved in the revolution of 1688. He was certainly involved in the events in London in December 1688. According to Roger Morrice, Bradbury was one of the lawyers summoned to attend the peers on 21 December on the nomination of the earl of Dorset, &#145;for he does the business of that family&#146;  (Beddard, 184). When he attended&#151;along with Maynard, Holt, Pollexfen, and Atkins&#151;on the following day, he helped to draft the order for removing papists from London. He also attended on 24 December when the peers debated how to call a free parliament. He was called to the bench of his inn on 7 February 1689, and was in heavy demand in the months following the revolution as a counsel in cases before the House of Lords. These included being assigned as counsel for Sir Adam Blair and others, who were impeached for dispersing proclamations of King James. On the recommendation of Shrewsbury and the duke of Norfolk, on 12 February 1689 he was appointed cursitor baron of the exchequer. He retained his place until his death on 12 February 1696. His will contains no mention of a marriage; his house &#145;being the sign of the White Lyon in the Strand&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/430/28) was left to his nephews and heirs in turn, the sons of his brother, Henry.<br>
