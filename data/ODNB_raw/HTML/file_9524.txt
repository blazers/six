<span class="headword">Fitton,  Michael</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1765, <em>d.</em> 1852), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Gawsworth, Cheshire, and baptized there on 29 December 1765. He was probably the son of Henry Fitton and Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelsall, the youngest of five children. It was claimed that he was a descendant of the ancient family of Fitton, once of Gawsworth Hall, but there is no evidence for the connection and Fitton or Fytton was a common name in that area of Cheshire.<br>
<br>In June 1780 Michael Fitton entered the navy as captain's servant to George Keppel in the <i>Vestal</i>. Fitton's family may have had some connection with the Keppels but the action which ensured that he received the lifelong support of his captain, George Keppel, arose from his keen observation and quick thinking. The <i>Vestal</i> had stopped an American packet and from aloft, seeing an object fall overboard from the detained ship, Fitton immediately alerted the deck below. The &#145;body&#146; proved to be a bag containing a secret treaty between American revolutionary forces and the Dutch, the discovery of which led directly to the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Captain Keppel was commended in parliament and clearly never forgot the quick reactions of his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Fitton followed Keppel to successive ships and finally to the <i>Hebe</i> in December 1782. He was promoted master's mate but when Keppel was superseded by Edward Thornbrough, Fitton clearly became increasingly unhappy and proceeded to desert his ship. Thornbrough wrote at the time &#145;Fitton Ran from Her Majesty's Ship <i>Hebe</i> under my command at Plymouth on 13th January 1784 and it does not appear to me in my present opinion that he is deserving of relief&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 36/10694). Thornbrough was not an officer to cross, having been entrusted with the naval training of the future William IV.<br>
<br>Fitton next appeared in naval records on 25 September 1794 as an able seaman, joining the <i>Defiance</i>, Keppel's first command following the outbreak of war with France  (TNA: PRO, ADM 36/11908). It is not known what Fitton did in the intervening period. However, in June 1795 Keppel was promoted to flag rank and went on to half pay, thereby restricting Fitton's chances of obtaining another berth as a sea officer. In December 1796 he therefore accepted the position of purser in the <i>Stork</i> which left the Nore for the West Indies at the height of the mutiny. A somewhat far-fetched story is told of how:<blockquote>as the <i>Stork</i> passed the line of battleships she was hailed by the mutineers who ordered her to heave to or be blown out of the water. &#145;If you fire so shall we&#146; responded Fitton. The <i>Stork</i> passed along the line unmolested. (Fytton, 26)</blockquote>After serving for two years in the <i>Stork</i> Fitton managed to obtain an appointment as acting third lieutenant in the <i>Abergavenny</i>, not a desirable berth since the flagship in Jamaica spent most of her time at Port Royal plagued with yellow fever. However, it was from here that Fitton was able to carve out an extraordinary reputation in capturing or sinking numerous enemy privateers and pirates. In seven years, with a short break during the peace of Amiens, vessels under his command captured or destroyed forty enemy ships and damaged many more. From 1799 to 1802 he commanded tenders of the <i>Abergavenny</i>, often capturing vessels significantly more powerful than his own. At the peace, however, he was sent home, still only a master's mate. This was probably the consequence of his desertion and possibly through the hostility of Edward Thornbrough, now an active flag officer. Keppel no longer had influence and was to die in 1805.<br>
<br>On the recommencement of hostilities Fitton returned to the West Indies. First in the <i>Gipsy</i> and later in the <i>Pitt</i> he continued his successful campaign against enemy privateers. However, it was for his part in a combined operation against Cura&ccedil;ao, which failed, that he was finally confirmed as a lieutenant on 9 March 1804. Possibly his most remarkable exploit was against the <i>Superbe</i>, one of the most successful of all Caribbean privateers. After a 67-hour chase Fitton finally caught up with his more powerful enemy, forced her ashore, captured and then burnt her. Soon afterwards he was superseded by an Admiralty nominee on the orders of the commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands. He returned to England &#145;not to be promoted to the rank of Commander but to be turned adrift as an unemployed Lieutenant&#146;  (James, 4.184). Certainly he was shabbily treated, notwithstanding his desertion. Despite spending &pound;400 of his own money in the purchase of the <i>Pitt</i>, all he received in return was the thanks of the Admiralty and a sword valued at &pound;50 from the Patriotic Society.<br>
<br>It was not until 1811 that Fitton obtained another appointment&#151;to the command of a brig, the <i>Archer</i>&#151;and then he moved to another brig, the <i>Cracker</i>, on the channel and Baltic stations. With the coming of peace, along with the overwhelming majority of elderly lieutenants, he received no further seagoing appointments. In 1831 he was appointed to the ordinary in Plymouth and he later received a Greenwich pension.<br>
<br>During these years Fitton wrote naval articles for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and other publications. His will leaves details of his wife, Mary Margaret, and their four children. The eldest son became a clerk in the Royal Navy and died in the West Indies. Another son worked in the merchant seaman's office and his youngest daughter married the son of Sir Richard Dobson, inspector of hospitals and fleets. Fitton died at his home in Clifton Road, Peckham, Surrey, on 31 December 1852. In his will he left the little property he had to his wife, in trust for his daughter Emily Mary Ann.<br>
<br>Michael Fitton's fame rests primarily on the extraordinary actions he carried out against enemy privateers and pirates in the Caribbean between 1799 and 1806. His success was such that the mid-twentieth-century novelist Showell Styles wrote a popular series of thirteen novels fictionalizing his exploits. Accounts of Fitton's successes also appear in all early-nineteenth-century naval histories. Some of these scholars knew Fitton as a Greenwich pensioner and swallowed his yarns complete. They even included an account of Fitton and his crew plunging overboard, their swords between their teeth, to overwhelm and capture a dangerous privateer. However, he clearly inspired his crew and won a large number of outstanding victories. The reluctance to promote him to a permanent lieutenancy until 1804 is understandable in light of his desertion from the <i>Hebe</i> in 1782. The treatment he received in 1806 is less comprehensible. According to Francis Fytton he was superseded from his last command, the <i>Pitt</i>, due to the machinations of the prize master whom he had accused of trading with the enemy. Styles suggests that Vice-Admiral James Richard Dacres, commander-in-chief in Jamaica, was responsible for the treatment he received (<span class="italic">Mr Fitton's Commission</span>, 1977, and other titles), though this does not tally with the glowing report on Fitton that Dacres sent to the Admiralty. Most likely the key factor was the opposition of Edward Thornbrough, a flag officer in close touch with the Admiralty. Whatever the cause, Michael Fitton has now achieved posthumous fame in the writings not only of Showell Styles but also those of Joseph Allen, E. P. Brenton, William James, J. K. Laughton, and W. R. O'Byrne.<br>
