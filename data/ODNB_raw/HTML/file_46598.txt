<span class="headword">Barran family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1842&#150;1952), <span class="occ">clothing manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_46598"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Barran</span>, first baronet  (1821&#150;1905)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 3 August 1821 at New Wandsworth, Surrey, the son of John Barran, a London gunmaker and his wife, Elizabeth Fletcher. He was educated privately. In 1842, for reasons which are not clear, he travelled by boat from London to Hull, and by railway to Leeds, where he found employment as an assistant in Thomas Gresham's small pawnbroking, jewellery, and clothing firm. As far as is known his family had no previous connection with Leeds. Within a few months he opened his own shop at 30 Bridge End South, Leeds, and began his career as a tailor. On 7 October 1848 he opened his &#145;Emporium of Fashion&#146; at a more prestigious location, no. 1 Briggate, one of the major thoroughfares in Leeds. There he carried a stock of ready-made items and tailored made-to-measure garments. His business expanded rapidly. He was one of the first in Britain to use Singer's new sewing machine to manufacture clothes. He established a small factory in Alfred Street, Leeds, then moved to larger premises at 1 Boar Lane. By 1856 he had between twenty and thirty machines at work, sewing his ready-to-wear clothes.<br>
<br>In 1858 Barran saw a bandsaw used for cutting furniture veneers being demonstrated at a furniture exhibition in Leeds. He recognized its potential in his trade and had it modified for cutting cloth in quantity. This led to the real take-off of his business. In 1867 he moved to much larger premises in Park Row, Leeds, where his technical innovation continued. With his eldest son, also John, he patented a counterweight iron and a foot control for powered sewing machines. By the 1870s his business had become extensive: he had 2000 sewing machines at work in 1872, all driven from a gas engine through shafting. In 1877 a yet larger factory was opened at Park Square, Leeds, and, in the following decade, yet another huge factory, in Hanover Lane, and a warehouse in Somers Street were built. By 1904 the firm employed more than 3000 in Leeds. It was the pre-eminent business in the early years of the Leeds ready-made clothing industry, specializing in the ready-to-wear trade for boys' clothes. John Barran was known as the little boys' tailor, but also made men's ready-made clothing. He married his first wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of Major Hirst, a local woollen manufacturer, in 1842, soon after his arrival in Leeds. They had six sons. He married his second wife, Eliza (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown), the widow of John Bilton of Park Lea, Scarborough, in 1878.<br>
<br>The rise and early success of the Barran business was primarily the result of John Barran's personal endeavours. He was particularly perceptive and innovatory in his production techniques and organizational methods: he is recognized as one of the innovators of the &#145;divisional system&#146; in the manufacture of clothing, by which different workers sewed different parts of the garment; he was instrumental in starting the transition from manufacture in small &#145;sweated workshops&#146; to airy, purpose-built premises; and he was in the vanguard of improving employment conditions for women and children in the clothing trade, campaigning as early as 1864 for reductions in the working hours for girls in the trade and paying attention to the welfare provisions for his workers.<br>
<br>John Barran was a prominent Leeds Baptist and a resolute nonconformist. He acted as president of the local Young Men's Christian Association. He served Leeds in a variety of political and philanthropic roles. An obituary described him as having &#145;occupied well-nigh every important honorary position in Leeds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening Post</span>, 3 May 1905). He was involved in, and a benefactor for, the purchase of Roundhay Park for the town. He was its Liberal MP from 1876 to 1885, then served the Otley constituency from 1886 to 1895 as a Gladstonian Liberal. He was never an orator in parliament, where his main contribution was to look after local interests. He was mayor of Leeds from 1870 to 1871. He served as a member of the council of the Yorkshire College, the forerunner of Leeds University, chairing its finance committee. He also served as president of Leeds chamber of commerce from 1873 to 1876. He served a long term as JP for the West Riding of Yorkshire and for Leeds. In February 1895 he was created a baronet for his public and political services. John Barran died at his London residence, 24 Queen's Gate, Kensington, on 3 May 1905.<br>
<br>His first son, John, died in tragic circumstances in 1886. His second son, Alfred, born on 29 June 1851, appears not to have been involved with the business, but three other sons, Charles, Henry, and <a href="#cosubject_52610">Rowland [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were all closely connected with the firm. Charles was a partner from 1878 to 1888. Henry, born in Leeds in 1856, succeeded his father as chairman from 1903 to 1918 and floated the business as a public company in 1903. He remained a director to 1942. He was succeeded as chairman in 1918 by <a name="cosubject_52610"></a><span class="headword">Sir Rowland Hirst Barran</span>  (1858&#150;1949)<span class="occ"></span>, who was the driving force in the company for much of the inter-war period. In 1887 he married Rose Cardew, daughter of the Revd Gilbert Bradley. They had one son and two daughters. His second marriage, in 1909, was to Louise (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of J. Stevenson Brown of Montreal, Canada. He was appointed a partner in the family business in 1882. He served as the Liberal MP for North Leeds from 1902 to 1918. In 1914 he undertook, with Sir Maurice Levy, the complete reorganization of war clothing contracts, for which work he was knighted in 1918. In the 1920s he took the firm into the women's ready-to-wear trade. He served as vice-chairman of the Federation of British Industries, and was a governor of Leeds grammar school and a life member of the court of Leeds University. He died at Bournemouth on 6 August 1949.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52612"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Nicholson Barran</span>, second baronet  (1872&#150;1952)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of John Barran's first son, John, and Eliza Henrietta, daughter of Edward Nicholson of Wokingham, Berkshire, was the first of the third generation to enter the family firm. He was born on 16 August 1872 and educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1902 he married Alice Margarita (<i>d</i>. 1939), daughter of the Revd Leighton Parks of New York city. They had a daughter and three sons, the youngest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76966/', "Sir David Haven Barran (1912&#150;2002)")</script>, became the chairman of the Shell Oil Company. His second marriage was in 1946 to Esther, eldest daughter of the Hon. F. M. B. Fisher. He served as the Liberal MP for Hawick burghs from 1909 to 1918. Between 1909 and 1916 he was a parliamentary secretary to a number of government ministers including the postmaster-general, the president of the Local Government Board, the home secretary, and the foreign secretary. From 1916 to 1918 he was parliamentary secretary to H. H. Asquith. He was a director of the Barran business from 1903 to 1921. He was nominated one of the three sheriffs of Yorkshire in 1920. He died on 8 July 1952. The title passed to John Leighton Barran, third baronet (1904&#150;1974), but the firm ceased to trade.<br>
