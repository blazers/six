<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, second earl of Angus  (<em>c.</em>1398&#150;1437), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7883/', "George Douglas, first earl of Angus, lord of Liddesdale and Jedburgh (1378x80?&#150;1403?)")</script>, and of Mary Stewart (<i>d</i>. in or after 1458), daughter of Robert III. He succeeded his father between 1402 and 1404. His interests were safeguarded by his grandmother, Margaret Stewart, countess of Angus, and her half-brother, Sir William Sinclair of Herdmanston. Although they secured Angus's rights to the earldom and to the lordships of Abernethy and Bunkle, his claims to the share of the Douglas estates held by his father were opposed. Liddesdale and Jedburgh were eventually obtained, but other lesser estates to which he had a claim were granted to rival kinsmen by Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1424). The dominance of the Black Douglas earl limited Angus's influence in southern Scotland. His marriage about 1415 to Margaret, daughter of William Hay of Yester, represented an attempt to strengthen his following in the south-east, and may also, since Hay was a very prominent retainer of the earl of Douglas, have been intended to promote a reconciliation between the two earls. But the potential rapprochement came to nothing, and from 1420 Angus was a rival to his Douglas cousins.<br>
<br>The turning point of Angus's career occurred in 1424 with the return of his uncle, James I, who included him in the group of nobles whom he knighted at his coronation in May that year. Angus was to be one of the king's closest allies among the nobility and the marriage of his sister Elizabeth to Alexander Forbes (<i>d</i>. 1448), a trusted royal councillor, reinforced his links with the royal circle. He backed the king's attacks on the house of Albany in 1425 and the lord of the Isles in 1429, and his castle of Tantallon, Haddingtonshire, was used as a gaol for two royal captives, the duchess of Albany and Alexander MacDonald of the Isles. The rewards of this service came in the south. Angus's efforts to replace the fourth earl of Douglas as the principal magnate in the region after the latter's death in 1424 were aided by the king, who secured Angus's appointment as protector of Coldingham Priory in 1428 and made him warden of the east and middle marches. This promotion brought him into conflict with George Dunbar, earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1456). Friction between Angus and March, combined with Anglo-Scottish tension, persuaded James I to intervene. In 1434 Angus seized March's castle at Dunbar and became the king's lieutenant on the border; he defeated an English attempt to aid the Dunbars at Piperdean, near Cockburnspath, in 1435. The bond between Angus and James I was evident in the crisis which followed the king's murder on 21 February 1437. Angus's capture of the earl of Atholl was the crucial victory of the king's adherents. The death of Angus himself, in October 1437, deprived the queen mother of the earl's support when she and his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54166/', "James Douglas")</script> (who became third earl of Angus) and George, were eclipsed by the Black Douglases.<br>
