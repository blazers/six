<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1656), <span class="occ">merchant and army officer</span>, was baptized on 6 May 1613 in Woburn, Bedfordshire, the son of William Sedgwick (<i>d</i>. 1632) and his wife, Elizabeth Howe, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25019/', "William Sedgwick (bap. 1609, d. 1663/4)")</script>. He emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1635, and then to Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1637; was made a freeman of the colony. He was elected captain of Charlestown's militia and deputy to the general court, the colony's legislature, in 1636, 1638&#150;44, 1648, and 1649. He also served as commander of Massachusetts's artillery company, which he had helped to found, in 1641, 1645, and 1648. In 1645 he commanded Castle Isle, the key to Boston harbour. In 1652 he was chosen major-general of Massachusetts.<br>
<br>Sedgwick was equally prominent in the colonial economy. Beginning as an importer, especially of cloth, he helped to organize the fisheries. He became a leading dealer in fish, his brother-in-law, London financier Robert Houghton, providing links to London importers. Working through partnerships, Sedgwick invested in the establishment of the famed Saugus Iron Works as well as the building of ships, wharves, and warehouses in the towns around Boston harbour. He also owned the Tide Mill at Charlestown, another of the colony's early major industrial projects. Inevitably involved in land development, he aided in the creation of the town of Woburn in 1642. His commercial and military interests gave him a sophisticated sense of England's imperial opportunities in the Americas. In 1644, for instance, he participated in a company to tap into the Great Lakes fur trade by flanking Dutch New Netherland by way of the Delaware valley. The scheme was thwarted by mismanagement and Dutch counter-measures. He also resisted the colony's isolationist impulses by petitioning in 1643 to repeal laws against Baptists and by protesting a 1645 law restricting residence of strangers to three weeks.<br>
<br>In 1653 Sedgwick returned to England to lobby for an American offensive against the Dutch during the First Anglo-Dutch War. In February 1654 Cromwell gave him four ships, 200 troops, and permission to raise local militia for an assault on New Netherland. Cromwell wished to impress New England with the protectorate's authority and intention to expand English power in America. In June 1654 the fleet arrived in Boston and soon 700 men were recruited. However, word arrived of the treaty of Westminster, ending hostilities, and though Sedgwick wished to continue the campaign, the New England governments refused and reopened commerce with the Dutch.<br>
<br>Instead, Sedgwick led his forces against the French in Acadia. From July to early September 1654 the expedition captured and garrisoned French posts at St John, Port Royal, and Pentagoet on the Penobscot, thus ending French penetration of the region for the next thirteen years. Sedgwick, working through his son-in-law John Leverett, then gathered a cargo of masts and sailed back to England.<br>
<br>Impressed, Cromwell, in June 1655, gave Sedgwick twelve ships and 800 soldiers to reinforce the Western Design, an expedition against the Spanish Caribbean. He found the demoralized army occupying Jamaica after its catastrophic defeat at Hispaniola. Although he lived less than a year from his arrival, Sedgwick, appointed one of the commissioners for civil government of the island, played a major role in laying the foundation for the eventual success of the new colony. He inaugurated the commerce between New England and Jamaica, essential to the future prosperity of both. He discouraged piracy, even against the Spanish, and sought instead permanent agricultural settlers. He failed to recruit New Englanders, but in March 1656 some 1400 planters from Nevis, led by their governor, migrated to Jamaica.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Sedgwick was oppressed by a sense of failure, and, soon after receiving word of his appointment as commander-in-chief of English forces in America, he died in Jamaica on 24 May 1656. His secretary claimed the new responsibilities had hastened his death. &#145;There is so much expected of me&#146;, he said, &#145;and I, conscious of my own disabilities, having besides so untoward a people to deal with, am able to performe soe little, that I shall never overcome it; it will breake my heart&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 5.155). He left a widow, Johanna Blake, and five children in London.<br>
