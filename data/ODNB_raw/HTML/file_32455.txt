<span class="headword">Clowes, Sir  William Laird</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Nauticus]</span>  (1856&#150;1905), <span class="occ">writer on naval issues</span>, born at Hampstead, London, on 1 February 1856, was the eldest son of William Clowes, sometime registrar in chancery and part editor of the fifth edition (1891) of Seton's <span class="italic">Forms and Judgments</span>. The younger Clowes was educated at Aldenham School at Elstree in Hertfordshire and at King's College, London, and began studying at Lincoln's Inn, London, on 16 April 1877. He had already, in 1876, published <span class="italic">Mero&euml;</span>, an Egyptian love tale in verse, and on 11 March 1879 left Lincoln's Inn for journalism. He was employed at first in the provinces but returned to London in 1882, marrying that year Ethel Mary Louise, second daughter of Lewis F. Edwards of Mitcham, Middlesex; they had one son, Geoffrey S. Laird (<i>b</i>. 1883).<br>
<br>In London Clowes gained his first insight into naval affairs on the staff of the <span class="italic">Army and Navy Gazette</span>. Concentrating on naval questions, he accompanied the Home Fleets during the manoeuvres as special naval correspondent successively of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (1885), <span class="italic">The Standard</span> (1887&#150;90), and <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1890&#150;95). His reputation for expert naval knowledge was soon established. Articles by him, some under the pseudonym Nauticus, on such topics as the role of torpedo boats in war, the gunning of battleships, and the use of the ram, were widely translated and apparently influenced expert opinion in many countries. His anonymous articles on &#145;The needs of the navy&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> in 1893, were credited with substantially increasing the naval estimates.<br>
<br>Naval interests did not monopolize Clowes's attention. In autumn 1890 he paid one of many visits to the USA, commissioned by <span class="italic">The Times</span> to study racial difficulties in the southern states. He published articles on this subject in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in November and December 1890, and then in 1891 in <span class="italic">Black America: a Study of the ex-Slave and his Master</span>, foretelling a terrible race war in the USA. An excellent linguist, in his later years he contributed frequently to reviews in England, France, and Germany. Besides historical and technical books he wrote many tales, mainly of the sea, and some verse. He was part author of <span class="italic">Social England</span> (6 vols., 1892&#150;7) and founded in 1896, and for some years edited, the <span class="italic">Naval Pocket Book</span>. He also edited <span class="italic">Cassell's Miniature Cyclopaedia</span> (1898) and did much to promote the issue of cheap reprints of standard literature; he was advisory editor in 1901 of the <span class="roman">Unit Library</span>.<br>
<br>Clowes gradually gave up journalism for research in naval history. Between 1897 and 1903 he compiled <span class="italic">The Royal Navy: its History from the Earliest Times</span> (7 vols.) in collaboration with Sir Clements Markham, A. T. Mahan, W. H. Wilson, and others. Its value was generally recognized and it continues in use. He also published other works of naval history. He was knighted in 1902 but because of ill health lived abroad, for some years at Davos, Switzerland. He was granted, in 1904, a civil-list pension of &pound;150. He was awarded the gold medal of the United States Naval Institute in 1892, was an associate of the Institution of Naval Architects, and in 1896 was elected an honorary member of the Royal United Service Institution, where he gave several lectures. In 1895 he was elected a fellow of King's College, London. He died at his home at Eversleigh Gardens, St Leonards, Sussex, on 14 August 1905. A civil-list pension of &pound;100 was granted to his widow on 30 November 1905.<br>
