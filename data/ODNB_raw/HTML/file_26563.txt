<span class="headword">Stokesley,  John</span>  (1475&#150;1539), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born on 8 September 1475 at Collyweston, Northamptonshire, the elder of two sons of Brian Stokesley, gentleman, and Margaret, daughter of Edward Spendlove (or Spendlowe). Stokesley was educated in Oxford, first at Magdalen College School and then at Magdalen College, where he became a fellow about 1495. He graduated MA in 1500, was successively ordained deacon (8 March 1504) and priest (22 March 1505), and proceeded DTh in 1516. His erudition in philosophy and theology was praised by Erasmus, while Polydore Vergil, John Leland, and Robert Wakefield were impressed by his knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He held a number of university and college offices, becoming vice-president of Magdalen College in 1506. His opposition to the absentee president, Richard Mayew, bishop of Hereford, led to his being accused of witchcraft, heresy, perjury, theft, and adultery. The charges were investigated by Bishop Richard Fox's commissary, John Dowman, between 28 and 30 January 1507. Stokesley was exonerated, left in sole charge of the college until a new presidential election was held about 1510, and allowed to continue to study Greek in Rome, at the college's expense.<br>
<br>Stokesley had a successful ecclesiastical career. He was vicar of Willoughby, Warwickshire (from February 1506), rector of Slimbridge, Gloucestershire (1505&#150;6), Brighstone, Isle of Wight (from 1518), and Ivychurch, Kent (from 24 March 1524). Through Fox's patronage he was also prebendary of Wherwell in Wherwell Abbey in 1528&#150;9 and of St Stephen's, Westminster (<i>c</i>.1524). He held higher office as archdeacon of Surrey (1522) and of Dorset (1523), and as dean of St George's, Windsor (1524), and was chaplain to Fox between 1515 and 1517, before being instituted as precentor of St Mary's, Southampton, in 1518. He attracted the attention of the king and, in quick succession, was named royal confessor (1517), royal chaplain (1519), royal councillor, and almoner (<i>c</i>.1520). As chaplain, he was present with the king in 1520 at the Field of Cloth of Gold and at Henry's subsequent meeting with Charles V at Gravelines. Wolsey, too, made much of Stokesley's abilities, giving him judicial duties for the council and in the court of requests. Edward Hall thought Stokesley exhibited rather &#145;more learning than discretion&#146; as a judge  (<span class="italic">Hall's Chronicle</span>, 2.585), although to Sir Geoffrey Elton he was an &#145;expert canon lawyer&#146;  (Elton, 161). Stokesley was also a receiver of petitions from Gascony in the parliament of 1523, was given additional financial resources for use at his own discretion as almoner, and was named dean of the chapels royal in 1524.<br>
<br>Stokesley was a leading supporter of Henry VIII's divorce from Katherine of Aragon, and perhaps one of the earliest. He solved the supposed contradiction over divorce between <span class="roman">Leviticus</span> and <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span> by interpreting the former as &#145;divine law&#146; and the latter as &#145;moral law&#146;, and this distinction proved useful to the king. Stokesley became the king's &#145;principal cause and instrument&#146; according to the imperial ambassador, who also claimed that Stokesley &#145;heartily repented&#146; his actions when Henry married Anne Boleyn  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 10, no. 752). In September 1529 he went with George Boleyn (later Viscount Rochford), as ambassador to France, to prevent the duke of Albany making alliances between Scotland and either France or the emperor, and also to stop the duke returning to Scotland. Stokesley was also to sound out Fran&ccedil;ois I on the projected conference on the question of a general council. He had been entrusted as well with the duty of informing Fran&ccedil;ois of &#145;the specialities and particularities&#146; of the marriage question, and instructed to &#145;extende his witt and lernyng to conduce them [French scholars]&#146; to give their support  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/56, fols. 103<i>r</i>&#150;104<i>r</i>, 106<i>rv</i>). By 2 July 1530 Stokesley and his colleagues had been successful in persuading the Paris faculties of law and divinity to determine in Henry VIII's favour; the universities of Toulouse, Angers, Bourges, and Orl&eacute;ans would follow suit. Stokesley, together with his colleagues, then went on to Italy as ambassador to the emperor and the pope. While there he sought academic support from Italian scholars and &#145;recovered it [the academic mission] when it had already fallen to the ground from the hands of the legates and was thereafter despaired of and wept over&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/82, fol. 13). He and his agents visited the universities of Bologna, Padua, and Ferrara, gaining several dozen favourable determinations and subscriptions. As a result, with Edward Fox (later bishop of Hereford) and Nicholas de Burgo, he was able to produce a work entitled <span class="italic">Gravissimae, atque exactissimae illustrissimarum totius Italiae et Galliae academiarum censurae</span> (1530) which, with several additions and alterations, was translated into English by Thomas Cranmer as <span class="italic">The Determinations of the Moste Famous and Mooste Excellent Universities of Italy and France</span> (1531). Stokesley and Fox were probably also responsible for the influential <span class="italic">Glasse of Truthe</span> (1532), a treatise favourable to the king's divorce, cast in the form of a dialogue between a lawyer and a divine.<br>
<br>Stokesley received his reward when he was nominated as bishop of London on 28 March 1530. He was enthroned by proxy (19 July), five days after the temporalities had been restored, and was consecrated on 27 November. As bishop, his involvement with the divorce issue continued. He debated with Thomas More and John Fisher, led the issue through both parliament (March 1531) and convocation (March to April 1533), was present when Cranmer declared the Aragon marriage null and void at Dunstable, harassed opponents at Syon Abbey and the London Charterhouse, and, finally, was the first scholar approached when the king wished to dissolve his marriage to Anne Boleyn. He was also one of the most vocal supporters of the royal supremacy, advocating all the legislation which abolished papal authority, propounding conciliarist theory and the king's own supreme authority. &#145;No one preached the supremacy more zealously&#146;  (Elton, 161). It has often been speculated that Stokesley came to regret the role he had taken in the divorce and royal supremacy: &#145;Oh! that I had holden still with my brother Fisher, and not left him, when time was!&#146;, he is said to have exclaimed  (BL, Harleian MS 6382, fol. 88<i>r</i>), but this is no doubt apocryphal, recorded as it is by Fisher's own, highly partial, biographer.<br>
<br>Stokesley's involvement in such issues did sometimes lead him into real difficulties, however. On 31 August 1531, while trying to assess the London benefices for their share in the cost to the English clergy of a royal pardon for a collective charge of <i>praemunire</i>, he was faced by a riotous mob, which gathered at the Greyfriars Church and &#145;made an assault upon the Bishop's palace at [St] Paul's&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 5, no. 387). Its leaders were later tried in Star Chamber. He also took part in the dissolution of a number of monasteries, and called for the dissolution of the larger houses two years before the government decided upon this measure. Hall wrote that the &#145;great and fatts abbottes&#146; had surrendered the smaller houses in the hopes of assuring the continuity of the larger ones, but that it had been said in the Lords that the smaller houses were &#145;as thornes, but the great abbottes were putrified olde oaks and they must nedes followe &amp; so will do other in Christendom qt Doctor Stokesley Bishop of London or many yeres be passed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hall's Chronicle</span>, 2.819). It was Stokesley who christened Princess Elizabeth at the Greyfriars Church, Greenwich (10 September 1533), and, with Cuthbert Tunstal, wrote a remonstrance to Reginald Pole (1537) in reply to the latter's <span class="italic">Pro unitatis ecclesiae defensione</span>, a tract later published as <span class="italic">Letter to Cardinal Pole</span> (1575).<br>
<br>A religious conservative, Stokesley opposed many of the more serious doctrinal changes being proposed in the 1530s. He and Tunstal tried to &#145;mayntayn as many off the old usags and traditions as they myght&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. E, v, fols. 308&#150;9). When the so-called <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span> was drawn up through a number of committee and synodal meetings in 1537, debate polarized around the exchanges between Stokesley and Edward Fox. Bishop Gardiner noted &#145;much stoutness&#146; between them and progress was slow:<blockquote>Bishop Stokesley would somewhat relent in the form, as Bishop Foxe did the like. And then, as it were in a mean, each part, by placing words by special marks, with a certain understanding protested, the article went forth; and so to a new article, and so from one to another.</blockquote>Any contradictions were recognized as such and allowed to stand, &#145;as if &hellip; saved by a proviso&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Muller, 351).<br>
<br>Stokesley was meticulous, moreover, in his pursuit of heretics, acting against such men as John Frith, Hugh Latimer, and William Tyndale. According to John Foxe, Stokesley boasted on his deathbed of having had over thirty heretics executed, while other contemporary accounts place the figure much higher. He also strenuously opposed the production of an English vernacular <span class="roman">Bible</span>. A staunch defender of episcopal authority, Stokesley resisted both Cranmer's metropolitan visitation of 1534 and the royal visitation of 1535, complaining of the mishandling of patronage which had left him destitute of learned men &#145;having no fitting promotion for them&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 720). But he is perhaps best remembered as an opponent of Thomas Cromwell's more grandiose reformation schemes. Although historians have exaggerated their enmity, the two men were often at loggerheads. In 1535 Stokesley preached a sermon at Paul's Cross which was much to Cromwell's liking. He asked the bishop to send a verbatim copy to the king for subsequent publication and distribution. Stokesley refused, not trusting Cromwell's integrity. He also disrupted Cromwell's patronage efforts and land exchanges, persecuted his officers, and opposed his negotiations with the German theologians. For his troubles, he was brought before the attorney-general on 29 May 1538, accused of treason and <i>praemunire</i> infringements. He did not contest the charges, but threw himself on the king's mercy, and received a royal pardon before a trial could be convened.<br>
<br>Stokesley died in London on 8 September 1539 shortly after his greatest triumph, the passing of the doctrinally reactionary <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>, of which he was considered one of the chief architects. On 14 September he was &#145;honourably buried&#146; in St Paul's before the altar in the lady chapel, behind the shrine of St Earconwald, under a marble slab inlaid with brass and inscribed with a Latin verse (an English version is printed by Dugdale), after what amounted to a state funeral. There exist two portraits of Stokesley. The original, by Hans Holbein, now part of the Royal Collection at Windsor, shows Stokesley (then vice-president of Magdalen) as a serious and straightforward man, in ecclesiastical robes, apparently interrupted while studying the book he holds in his hand. A copy, presented by the antiquary J. R. Bloxam, hangs in Magdalen College School.<br>
