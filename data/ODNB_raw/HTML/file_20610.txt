<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogle,  James Adey</span>  (1792&#150;1857), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 22 October 1792 in Great Russell Street, London, the son of Richard Ogle, a general practitioner, and his wife, Hannah, formerly Adey. In 1808 he was sent to Eton College, of which Dr Joseph Goodall was then provost. He matriculated on 13 April 1810 as a commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, obtained a scholarship in 1812, and graduated BA in 1813 with a first class in mathematics and physics. Adopting his father's profession he commenced his medical studies at William Hunter's school of medicine in Great Windmill Street, London. On the proclamation of peace in 1814 he travelled to the continent, and in the course of that and some succeeding years he visited many of the leading medical schools of France, Italy, and Germany. He also passed (as was then customary) some winter sessions in Edinburgh, studying under professors Gregory, Duncan, Hamilton, Gordon, Home, and Jamieson. Through his Eton and Oxford connections he gained access to the city's intellectual circles. On returning to London he pursued his medical studies there as a pupil at the Middlesex Hospital, and subsequently at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and graduated at Oxford MA and BM in 1816 and 1817 respectively. In the latter year he also obtained a university licence to practise medicine.<br>
<br>Upon settling in Oxford, Ogle set up in practice. Although this thrived, his possession of independent means allowed him to lead a comparatively leisurely professional life and to indulge his love both of literature and of social activities. In 1819 he married Sarah, younger daughter of Jeston Homfray of Broadwaters, near Kidderminster. She died in 1835, leaving four sons and five daughters, one of whom became the wife of James Bowling Mozley, and another the wife of Manuel John Johnson. The third son, Dr William Ogle, became superintendent of statistics in the registrar-general's office.<br>
<br>In 1820 Ogle graduated DM and was appointed mathematical tutor of his old college, Trinity. One of his pupils was John Henry Newman, with whom he maintained a close friendship in later life, though he was not himself a Roman Catholic. Ogle was elected FRCP in 1822. In 1824 he became physician to both the Radcliffe Infirmary, where he was unanimously chosen in succession to Robert Bourne, and the Warneford Lunatic Asylum at Oxford. He was appointed Aldrich professor of medicine in the university in 1824, public examiner in mathematics in 1825, and Aldrich clinical professor of medicine in 1830. Ogle's professional duties were very light since he had few pupils. He gave occasional lectures at his home in St Giles. In 1835 he worked with Drs Kidd and Daubeny to improve the teaching of natural sciences and to revise the university statutes regulating medical degrees, which resulted in the introduction of a public examination for the degree of BM.<br>
<br>Ogle also revived practical instruction at the Radcliffe Infirmary. Between 1837 and 1840 he organized a course of clinical lectures, and by 1840 had a lecture room equipped. Between 1833 and 1840 he had some thirty-seven pupils, but only three were members of the university, and this fragile aspiration for a school of medicine was soon eclipsed. Between 1840 and 1854 there were only fourteen candidates for the BM degree. Ogle wrote nothing on medicine; during the 1854&#150;5 cholera epidemic he compiled notes and statistics on the disease but did not write them up. During the outbreak he opposed the accommodation of cholera patients in the Radcliffe Infirmary, mainly on account of the cost. His only publication, <span class="italic">A letter to the Reverend the Warden of Wadham College, on the system of education pursued at Oxford; with suggestions for remodelling the examination statutes</span>, appeared in 1841. The pamphlet was noteworthy in containing the first suggestion of a school of natural science at Oxford; this was afterwards established by a statute proposed in 1851 on behalf of the reformers by Sir H. W. Acland. Yet Ogle was hostile to research, asserting in the pamphlet that &#145;the prosecution of Truth forms no part of our duties&#146;  (J. A. Ogle, <span class="italic">A letter to the Reverend the Warden of Wadham College</span>, 1841, 9). Ogle also anticipated another change, by his proposal that &#145;candidates for admission to the university should have their attainments tested <i>in limine</i> [at the outset]&#146; by an examination which became known as &#145;responsions&#146;.<br>
<br>Ogle was elected FRS in 1826. His professional success was marked by his delivery of the Harveian oration in 1844, and by his appointment as regius professor of medicine at Oxford by Lord John Russell in 1851, in succession to Dr John Kidd. He held the latter post in conjunction with the clinical and Aldrichian professorships and with the Tomline readership in anatomy. Ogle was president of the Provincial Medical Association at its meeting at Oxford in 1852, and was examiner in the new school of natural science in 1854&#150;5.<br>
<br>Ogle died of apoplexy after an illness of thirty hours, at the vicarage, Old Shoreham, Sussex, the residence of his son-in-law James Bowling Mozley, on 25 September 1857; he was buried on 2 October in St Sepulchre's cemetery at Jericho in Oxford. He left 6000 guineas to his eldest son James, and &pound;3000 to each of his other children.<br>
<br>Kindly and good-natured, Ogle was &#145;a man of liberal views and great depth and sincerity of feeling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jackson's Oxford Journal</span>, 56). His house at Oxford was the rendezvous of a wide circle of friends. In appearance Ogle was &#145;handsome&#146; and &#145;clean shaven &hellip; with an attractive expression&#146;  (Gibson, 113). By nature cautious, he was inclined to adhere to the older traditions of his profession, from the active practice of which he withdrew in his later years, though attending old friends and giving gratuitous advice to the poor. Nevertheless, he did not oppose modern developments of scientific study at the infirmary and in the university, which were the subject of keen controversy at the time.<br>
