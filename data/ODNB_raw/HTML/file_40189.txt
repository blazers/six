<span class="headword">Maugham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barnardo; <em>other married name </em>Wellcome]</span>,  (Gwendoline Maud) Syrie</span>  (1879&#150;1955), <span class="occ">interior decorator</span>, was born on 10 July 1879 at The Cedars, Banbury Road, Hackney, London, the eldest daughter and third of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30600/', "Thomas John Barnardo (1845&#150;1905)")</script>, medical doctor and philanthropist, and Sarah Louise (Syrie) Elmslie (1850?&#150;1945?), daughter of William Elmslie, Lloyd's underwriter and charity worker, and his wife. Her father was Irish, and her mother English; both their families were members of a religious sect, the Open Plymouth Brethren, and their eldest daughter, Syrie (a compression of Sarah Louise), grew up in a paradoxical background of philanthropy and affluence, reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with her family and forbidden from attending the theatre.<br>
<br>At sixteen Syrie Barnardo was engaged to the son of a wealthy family from Richmond, only to discover that the man had a mistress. In 1901 she escaped from this unhappy situation&#151;and her religious family life&#151;on a trip to Egypt, and met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36824/', "Sir Henry Wellcome (1853&#150;1936)")</script>, the wealthy American pharmaceutical manufacturer, twenty-six years her senior. Their marriage, which took place on 25 June 1901, lasted nine years, during which she &#145;acquired poise and sophistication but grew weary of an elderly companion who was said by her to be sexually inadequate&#146;  (Connon, <span class="italic">Somerset Maugham</span>, 57). A son, Henry Mounteney, born in 1903, was diagnosed as mentally handicapped, and was later fostered by a farming family. Irritable and distrustful, Wellcome accused his wife of infidelity with an American financier, Archer Harman. In 1910 the couple separated.<br>
<br>Living independently on an allowance of &pound;2400 a year, in 1913 Syrie Wellcome was introduced to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34947/', "(William) Somerset Maugham (1874&#150;1965)")</script>, already one of London's best-known playwrights, and a relationship developed. Their daughter, Elizabeth Mary (Liza), was born in Rome on 5 May 1915, at which point Syrie was still married to Henry Wellcome (who named Maugham as co-respondent and uncovered &#145;proof&#146; of his wife's infidelity with several men, among them Gordon Selfridge).<br>
<br>During the war Somerset Maugham became an ambulance driver, and met Gerald Haxton, with whom he began a disastrous relationship. He was now working for the secret service, and Somerset Maugham and Syrie married in Jersey City, New Jersey, on 26 May 1917. With her husband often away&#151;usually with Haxton&#151;Syrie pursued her interest in interior design, having acquired experience when working for the antiques department of Fortnum and Mason. The American decorator Elsie de Wolfe, Lady Mendl, is said to have told her in 1920 that &#145;the decorating field is already overcrowded&#146;  (Fisher, 16). None the less she launched her decorating business in London's Baker Street in 1922, financed by the sale of her own house.<br>
<br>Combining French art deco (with its eighteenth-century references) and European modernism, Maugham produced her distinctive look: sleek, sophisticated interiors, a de luxe hedonism of lambskin carpets and elongated sofas. She patronized designers such as Marion Dorn and Oliver Messel; her motifs were the plaster palm frond and the sea shell in a 1920s version of rococo. &#145;With the strength of a typhoon she blew all colour before her,&#146; wrote Cecil Beaton. &#145;For the next decade Syrie Maugham bleached, pickled or scraped every piece of furniture in sight&#146;  (Beaton, 208). Above all, white became her signature. Her house in the King's Road, Chelsea, and the Villa Eliza in Le Touquet became society showrooms for her wares (Somerset Maugham complained that bits of furniture would vanish from their house overnight). Like her Chelsea neighbour and rival, Sibyl Colefax, Syrie Maugham was an adept hostess, claiming to have thrown the first-night party for No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">The Vortex</span>, a sensational success much compared to Maugham's play <span class="italic">Our Betters</span> (1923, written after hearing Syrie's stories of her affairs and Gordon Selfridge's offer to settle &pound;5000 per annum on her). Her interiors of 1927 and 1930 respectively for Coward's country and town houses resembled sets from his plays: the Syrie sofas, zebra-print cushions, and limed Louis Quinze chairs as upholstered, seductive symbols of an elegant if amoral age.<br>
<br>The Maughams were now leading separate lives; they divorced in May 1929, leaving Syrie to bring up their daughter, Liza. Pursuing the lucrative American market, she opened shops in New York, Chicago, Palm Beach, and Los Angeles; in England her commission in 1936 to decorate Fort Belvedere, on the edge of Windsor Great Park, for the then prince of Wales was &#145;perhaps her best job&#146;, claimed <span class="italic">House and Garden</span>, &#145;a series of romantic rooms &hellip; enhanced by the reflection, in huge mirrors, of swans on the lake outside&#146;  (Fisher, 34).<br>
<br>But reality was encroaching on this inter-war fantasy. Maugham spent part of the Second World War in New York, and in 1944 returned to London, her finances &#145;much reduced&#146;  (Fisher, 68). She continued to work&#151;mostly abroad&#151;until illness prevented her. She died at her Park Lane flat on 25 July 1955, aged seventy-six, and was buried in the Oxfordshire village where her daughter (later Lady Glendevon) lived. In 1964 Beaton, Coward, Rebecca West, Beverley Nichols, and others presented a bust by the Russian sculptor Fyodor Shubin of Catherine the Great to the Victoria and Albert Museum in her memory.<br>
<br>It was a memory already vilified by Maugham's memoirs, <span class="italic">Looking Back</span>, published in 1962, claiming that he was not the father of their daughter, Liza. Enraged by Maugham's treatment of his wife, Nichols published his own gossipy diatribe, <span class="italic">A Case of Human Bondage</span> (1966); to Coward this was just &#145;another essay in bitchiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coward Diaries</span>, 633). The playwright's own response to <span class="italic">Looking Back</span> was <span class="italic">A Song at Twilight</span> (also 1966) in which an embittered writer is confronted with his homosexuality by his ex-wife.<br>
<br>Richard Fisher described Syrie Maugham as &#145;strikingly beautiful &hellip; of average height, with jet black hair, an ivory skin of Rossettian perfection, and an exquisite figure&#146;  (Fisher, 8). Her voice was high pitched, and her manner autocratic; yet she attracted loyal friends and remained supportive of Maugham, refusing to return his vindictiveness. Coward noted, &#145;One could test the intelligence of one's friends by seeing if they had noted that Syrie was much more intelligent than Willie&#146;  (Morgan). Although forever associated with her &#145;no-colour&#146; phase&#151;Beaton noted that she later adopted &#145;the vivid colours of lobster salad&#146;  (Beaton, 209), as her designs for Stephen Tennant at Wilsford Manor, Wiltshire, in 1938 indicated&#151;she was the first English woman to pursue interior decoration as a career, and was a lasting influence on such decorators as David Hicks.<br>
