<span class="headword">Russell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stewart]</span>,  Katherine Frances <span class="st"> [Kit]</span></span>  (1909&#150;1998), <span class="occ">social worker and university teacher</span>, was born at 20 Southwell Gardens, Kensington, London, on 6 April 1909, the eldest of the four daughters and second of the seven children of Sir Francis Hugh (Frank) Stewart (1869&#150;1921), a partner in Gladstone, Wyllie &amp; Co., merchants, of London and Calcutta, and his wife, Frances Henrietta (1885&#150;1962), eldest daughter of Arthur George Rickards, barrister. Sent home at the age of five from India in 1914, Kit Stewart did not see her parents again for five years. In 1921, and only eight months after he had retired, her father died. Widowed at thirty-seven with seven children under fourteen to support, Lady Stewart worked as the organizing secretary of the St Pancras Housing Association. Her connection with this and other voluntary organizations proved an important influence on the path in life her eldest daughter was to follow, as also was Olive Willis, founder and first headmistress of Downe House, the independent girls' boarding-school Kit Stewart attended. On leaving the school at the age of seventeen, she at first combined running the family household with voluntary work outside the home. This early work in the impoverished dockside area of Bermondsey, in Southwark, was at Time and Talents, a settlement started in 1887 by Christian society ladies. In 1931 she went to the London School of Economics (LSE) and in 1933, having gained the certificate in social science, she became the warden of the Time and Talents club house in Dockhead. She remained a devoted supporter of the settlement and admirer of Bermondsey people until the very end of her life.<br>
<br>In 1937 Kit Stewart was recruited by the London Council of Social Service to organize community activities on the new Honor Oak housing estate in Lewisham, but following the outbreak of the Second World War she moved in 1940 to become warden of a youth centre in Southampton, a city by then suffering heavily under the blitz. Three years later she joined her former LSE tutor and great friend Eileen Younghusband, with whom for some years she shared a flat, in work for the British Council. Their task was to train &#145;allied nationals&#146; for the social welfare work that would be needed in shattered western Europe, then still occupied. In 1945, the war over, she took charge of five emergency courses run by the Institute of Almoners to ease the shortage of hospital social workers in Britain that the war had engendered, and in 1949 moved on to the social science department at the LSE, first as practical work organizer, later as senior lecturer. She retired from the LSE in 1973, but continued as president of the LSE Society for many years. She was appointed OBE in 1976, and made an honorary fellow of the LSE in 1978. Although more interested in people than in research, after her retirement in 1973 she drafted and sent a detailed questionnaire to 2000 past LSE social administration students, and largely by personal follow-up got a 90 per cent response. The book from the study, <span class="italic">Changing Course</span> (1981), was described by Ralf Dahrendorf as &#145;a story of professionalisation, a story of social mobility, a story of career patterns, a story of the role of women, and a story of the imprint of individuals and their initiative&#146;  (Russell and Barnes, 255).<br>
<br>Tall, slim, and with silky golden hair always worn in a loose bun, Kit Stewart was classically beautiful, and remained so into old age. At forty-eight she married Sheridan Russell, described &#145;as a bright-eyed elfin figure of warmth and wit&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 17 July 1998). Recruited in 1945 to the first emergency course as the first male student in an entirely female profession, he soon became a close friend, but they did not marry until 1 June 1957. Commenting on marriage ten years earlier, she had written to one of her students about to marry, &#145;I do <i>so</i> believe in marriage. It must be the perfect maximum giving and receiving&#146;  (personal knowledge). So it proved to be with her own marriage, which led to a remarkable partnership that Dame Eileen Younghusband described as &#145;proving that one and one sometimes adds up to much more than two&#146;  (Russell and Barnes, 241).<br>
<br>Born on 23 March 1900 at 61a Curzon Street, Mayfair, London, <a name="cosubject_76184"></a><span class="headword">Sheridan William Robin Russell</span>  (1900&#150;1991)<span class="occ"></span> was the younger son of Henry Russell (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;1937), professor of singing, and his wife, Nina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Andrade (<i>b</i>. 1870). Music was a prominent theme in his family: Russell's father became artistic director of first the San Carlo and later the Boston Opera companies; his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35820/', "Sir Landon Ronald (1873&#150;1938)")</script>, was a composer and conductor, as was his paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24312/', "Henry Russell (1812?&#150;1900)")</script>. His mother was the daughter of a Spanish leather merchant and his Portuguese wife. Both parents were of partly Jewish descent. Sheridan Russell grew up in Rome, Paris, Boston, and London, with little formal education but on familiar terms with singers and composers of the times. He became a young virtuoso cellist, but because of a hearing defect (first noticed by Debussy) had later to abandon this career&#151;although not his musical and artistic interests. Fluent in French, English, and Italian, he was recruited for work at Bletchley Park and later in the war was transferred, with the rank of captain, to work with the Italian partisans. His change to social work after the war led to another distinguished career as head almoner at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. While there he started the flourishing and nationwide Paintings in Hospital charity&#151;to which in its early days he persuaded Matthew Smith, among other well-known painters, to contribute works.<br>
<br>Until late old age Sheridan Russell never abandoned his cello playing, and in their drawing room at 100 Cheyne Walk the Russells held nearly 300 soir&eacute;es of chamber music. They called on Russell's many professional musician friends to take part, and &#145;entertained thousands of LSE students and staff and an eclectic circle of friends from social services and government, the arts and the sciences&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 17 July 1998). Sheridan Russell died at home on 9 April 1991. After his death Kit organized the preparation and private publication of a book, <span class="italic">Sheridan's Story</span> (1993). All 1800 copies were sold. Kit Russell's warmth and kindness were legendary and underpinned by her profound Christian belief; but she could be exacting on behalf of the commitments she cared for and put so much into. She died on 9 July 1998 at St George's Nursing Home, Westminster, of old age and was buried at Christ Church, Flood Street, Chelsea.<br>
