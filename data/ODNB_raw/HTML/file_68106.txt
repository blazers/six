<span class="headword">Whitshed,  William</span>  (1679&#150;1727), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Whitshed MP (1645&#150;1697) and his wife, Mary Quin. He probably never married since his property was inherited by the Hawkins family, who changed their name to Whitshed; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29321/', "Admiral Sir James Hawkins Whitshed")</script> was perhaps the most prominent member of that family. He entered the Middle Temple on 16 June 1694. He was returned for co. Wicklow in the first parliament of Queen Anne. Like many politicians of this period he tried to have a bet both ways; he was considered a whig until October 1707 when he began to waver. However, he returned to the fold after 1709 and was appointed solicitor-general on 5 January 1710, during the whig administration of Lord Lieutenant Wharton, only to be dismissed the following year by the tory Lord Lieutenant Ormond. Whitshed was one of the leaders of the whig party in 1713 and was again returned for Wicklow at the general election of that year. He was a member of the 1713 Commons committee appointed to report on the &#145;misconduct&#146; of Sir Constantine Phipps. The 1713 parliament was brief and was subsequently dissolved by the queen's death on 1 August 1714. Following the Hanoverian succession Whitshed was appointed, on 14 October 1714, lord chief justice of the king's bench. He was sworn of the privy council on 11 November 1714.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1719 Whitshed was one of those summoned by the lord lieutenant on the eve of parliament to consider how far the relief of dissenters should be pressed (the penal laws of Queen Anne's reign also affected dissenters). Whitshed and Jonathan Swift were enemies. Whitshed pronounced Swift's tract in favour of Irish manufactures a seditious publication but was himself the butt of Swift's cruel lampooning. Whitshed had gained the inheritance of an estate worth some &pound;1000 from the Quin family of High Street, Dublin, by proving the illegitimacy of a son, James. Swift fastened on the &#145;chicanery&#146; which the Whitsheds were reputed to have used in excluding James Quin from his inheritance to satirize their family motto:<blockquote>
<div>Libertas et Natale Solum:<br>
</div>
<div>Fine words! I wonder where you stole 'em.<br>
</div> (Woolley, 181, n. 52)</blockquote>But perhaps the most interesting event of Whitshed's judicial career was that which occurred on 16 June 1721:<blockquote>During the trial [in the court of king's bench] a neighbouring chimney took fire, blew the smoke into the court and gave a panick to all the people who crowded to get out. Many were actually killed on the spot, and many desperately wounded. Among the first Mr John Ormsby, Member of Parliament and a wealthy man of above &pound;1,800 p.a., was killed. Judge Caulfield got half in and half out of a window, but could not pass through, lost his wig and at last was forced back. Lord Chief Justice Whitshed kept his place and temper till at last the truth was known. (BL, Add. MS 34778, fol. 51)</blockquote>On 20 December 1726, following the resignation of Lord Chancellor Broderick and the appointment of Chief Justice Wyndham as his successor, Primate Boulter wrote to the duke of Newcastle:<blockquote>my Lord Chief Justice <i>Whitshed</i> has been with me, to desire that he may be recommended to succeed Lord Chief Justice <i>Wyndham</i> in the Common Pleas. He complains that he finds the business of his present station very fatiguing as he advances in life, and says the two stations are about the same value; but the Common Pleas is a place of less trouble: he represents that he has with great zeal and fidelity served his Majesty, and made himself many enemies by so doing, and would hope for this favour as a reward for his services. I must do him the justice to say, that he has certainly served his Majesty with great zeal and affection, and has drawn upon himself the anger of the Jacobites by so doing, and the malice of other discontented persons here, by discountenancing seditious writings in the affair of the halfpence: and if we may have another person of worth from <i>England</i> to succeed him, I think he may deserve the favour he desires. (<span class="italic">Boulter Letters</span>, 1.89&#150;90)</blockquote>Whitshed had supported the government over Wood's halfpence and had generally behaved in a quiet and loyal fashion; he was duly appointed lord chief justice of the common pleas on 10 February 1727. He died six months later, on 19 August 1727, at Mary Street, Dublin, and was buried in St Michael's Church, Dublin.<br>
