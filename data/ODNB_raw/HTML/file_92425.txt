<span class="headword">Villiers <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Beaumont]</span>,  Mary</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Buckingham  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1632), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire, and Elizabeth Armstrong. She came from an old but not especially affluent gentry family, and the fact that in her early life she acted as a companion and waiting gentlewoman to her wealthier relative Lady Beaumont of Coleorton led some hostile contemporaries such as Sir Anthony Weldon and Roger Coke to exaggerate her humble social background. About 1590 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28292/', "Sir George Villiers")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28288/', "Villiers, Sir Edward")</script>] of Brooksby, Leicestershire, with whom she had four children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28299/', "John Villiers (1591?&#150;1658)")</script>, Susan (1591?&#150;1655), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers (1592&#150;1628)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28287/', "Christopher Villiers (d. 1630)")</script>. Following her husband's death on 4 January 1606, Mary moved with her children into the dower house at Goadby Marwood: in addition to a life interest in the house, with its estate of 360 acres, she had a jointure of &pound;200 a year. On 19 June 1606 she married Sir William Rayner: he was said to be aged eighty and died the following November.<br>
<br>Mary was by all accounts a beautiful woman, and her third and favourite child George, later duke of Buckingham, inherited her looks. Mary encouraged him to develop courtly skills such as fencing and dancing, and he always remained grateful for the &#145;more then ordinarie naturall love of a mother which you have ever borne me even from that infancie when I did nothinge els but unresonablie and frowardlie rangle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, HMC, 256). Possibly in part to further her ambitions for herself and her son, she befriended and later married the wealthy Sir Thomas Compton (<i>d</i>. 1626), brother of Sir William Compton, later created earl of Northampton, who entertained the king and queen at his home on several occasions. Although her attempts to secure a marriage alliance between her son and Frances Coke, daughter of judge and privy councillor Sir Edward Coke, were thwarted by Coke's wife, Lady Elizabeth Hatton, by 1616 George was firmly established in the favour of James I. On 1 July 1618 Mary was created countess of Buckingham in her own right for life, an honour she pointedly refused to share with her husband, and it was rumoured that her elevation was made conditional on her withdrawal from court.<br>
<br>By this time, the countess was strongly inclining towards Roman Catholicism and fell under the influence of a Jesuit called John Percy, more generally known by his assumed name of Fisher. In January 1622 one of the royal chaplains, Dr Francis White, held a conference with the Jesuit in an attempt to rebut his opinions. William Laud, then bishop of St David's, participated in a similar conference in May, but to no avail: by September, Mary had converted to Rome, and as a result was ordered not to attend court. She apparently continued to do so, however: she was with the king constantly after Buckingham and Prince Charles returned from Spain in October 1623, and on James's fifty-eighth birthday on 19 June 1624 she and her daughter Susan, now countess of Denbigh, went hunting with him at Wanstead. It was later claimed in 1626 that she helped to persuade her daughter to convert to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Although the countess of Buckingham undoubtedly exercised some influence, it is possible that this was not quite as great as some suitors hoped or as some enemies feared. For example, John Chamberlain claimed in February 1621 that Sir James Ley owed his appointment as lord chief justice to his being engaged to one of Mary's relatives, but in fact Ley's fianc&eacute;e was not related to her at all. Sometimes those who requested her to intercede with Buckingham, for instance in seeking the release of a detained ship in February 1625, found that she was not able to persuade her son. The following month Mary was with James VI and I during his final illness, and suggested the application of a plaster to his wrists and stomach. Some later alleged that this&#151;together with the duke's gift of a posset drink&#151;contributed to the king's death. In the parliament of 1626 the impeachment articles against Buckingham accused him of procuring honours for his kindred, and specifically mentioned his mother's ennoblement as countess of Buckingham. The duke denied this charge and insisted that &#145;the title of Countess of Buckingham bestowed upon the mother was not without precedent, and she has nothing from the crown but a title of honour which dies with her&#146;  (Bidwell and Jansson, 1.577). A further indication that the influence of Buckingham and his mother was not always as great as their enemies claimed was the fact that when, shortly after Charles I's accession, Buckingham asked for his mother and wife to be appointed ladies of the bedchamber, Henrietta Maria refused. It was only on 11 August 1626, after the expulsion of the queen's French attendants, that the countess and the duchess of Buckingham were admitted to this office.<br>
<br>Buckingham's meteoric rise helped him to maintain his mother in some comfort. In July 1620 he contracted to pay her &pound;1300 a year, and in 1624 this allowance was raised to &pound;2000. Buckingham continued to support her after her third husband, Sir Thomas Compton, died in April 1626, and that same year he obtained for her use the large house at Chelsea (formerly Sir Thomas More's residence) that had belonged to the earl of Middlesex. The latter ceded this house to Buckingham in return for a reduction of his fine following his impeachment. At about this time, with her son's full approval, Mary also acquired another large property, and this purchase apparently placed her finances under some strain. In August 1627, during the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition, Buckingham asked his mother &#145;if it be possible for you to lend me some monie doe it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, HMC, 256). She replied that she was &#145;very sorie you have entered into so great busines and so little care to supply your wants &hellip; As for monyis, the kindom will not supply your expences, and every man grones under the burden of the tymes.&#146; She remained devoted to him&#151;&#145;If I had a world you should command it&#146;&#151;but reminded him that all her available capital had been spent on buying her new property, and added: &#145;I never dremed you should have needed any of my helpe, for if I had, ther should have wanted all, and my selfe, before you&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/75/22, countess of Buckingham to duke of Buckingham, 26? Aug 1627).<br>
<br>In the parliament of 1628 Mary was strongly attacked for her religion and for encouraging her co-religionists. John Pym allegedly called her &#145;a great papist&#146;: he complained that there was &#145;more resort [to her] than to any church&#146; and that &#145;by her the most active papists in England are brought to Court&#146;  (Johnson and others, 4.143, 151, 163). Walter Long was reported as saying that she was &#145;a fosterer of recusants&#146; and that he was sorry she remained at court given that there was &#145;no necessity she should be there&#146;  (ibid., 4.259, 265). The remonstrance that the Commons presented to Charles on 17 June lamented that:<blockquote>those of that religion do find extraordinary favours and respect in Court from persons of great quality and power there, unto whom they continually resort, and in particular to the Countess of Buckingham, who, herself openly professing that religion, is a known favourer and supporter of them that do the same. (ibid., 4.312)</blockquote>Just as Mary had expressed unhappiness over the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition, so she seems to have had reservations about Buckingham's plans for another campaign in 1628. According to Edward Hyde, in his later recollections written as earl of Clarendon, &#145;about six months&#146; before the duke's assassination on 23 August 1628, she had a stormy interview with her son lasting &#145;two or three hours&#146;: their voices were raised and after &#145;the Duke's leaving&#146; she was &#145;overwhelmed in tears, and in the highest agony imaginable&#146;. Clarendon later recorded that:<blockquote>it is a notorious truth that when the news of the Duke's murder (which happened within few months after) was brought to his mother, she seemed not in the least degree surprised, but received it as if she had foreseen it; nor did afterwards express such a degree of sorrow as was expected from such a mother for the loss of such a son. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.54&#150;5)</blockquote>Mary died at the Gate House, Whitehall, on 19 April 1632, and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 21 April. She shares a fine altar-tomb, by Nicholas Stone, with her first husband, Sir George Villiers, in St Nicholas's chapel, and her effigy depicts her wearing an ermine-lined cloak, veil, and coronet. In her will, she had requested to be buried &#145;as neare as conveniently may bee unto my beloved sonne the Duke of Buckingham&#146;, and St Nicholas's chapel stood not far from Buckingham's splendid tomb in the north chapel of Henry VII's chapel. In that will, which was dated 12 April 1631 and had a codicil dated 4 April 1632, Mary made a series of bequests of jewels and money to her children and grandchildren, and to members of her household. The &#145;residue and surplusage&#146; of her estate she left to her grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9249/', "Basil Feilding, Lord Feilding")</script>. She estimated that her entire estate was not worth more than &pound;15,000. The will was proved on 7 May 1632. Thomas Lermy wrote that her estate was &#145;not so great as was in her lyfe believed to bee they say not above one 1000<i>l</i>. by year&#146;  (Thomas Lermy to Sir Henry Vane, 1 May 1632, TNA: PRO, SP 16/216/5).<br>
