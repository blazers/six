<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Felltham,  Owen</span>  (1602?&#150;1668), <span class="occ">essayist and poet</span>, was the son of Thomas Felltham (1569?&#150;1632) of Mutford, Suffolk, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1629), daughter of John Ufflete of Somerleyton, Suffolk. Thomas, a well-to-do member of the gentry, bore arms (on a field sable, two bars ermine, in chief three leopards' faces or), which Felltham caused to be engraved, with the crescent cadency mark of a second son, on the title-pages of the second (1628) and subsequent editions of his major work, <span class="italic">Resolves</span>. Felltham's elder brother Thomas became wealthy as a vintner in Norwich and was named executor and sole heir in his father's will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/161/64); his younger brother Robert was for a time attorney of the court of chancery before settling in Sculthorpe, Norfolk. Felltham had three sisters: Mary, Frances, and Elizabeth  (pedigrees, BL, Harleian MS 5861, fol. 76; MS 1169, fol. 81). Both brothers were still living when Felltham made his will in 1667 but no sisters are mentioned in that document  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/326, fols. 363<i>v</i>&#150;364).<br>
<br>Felltham was educated by a private tutor in the standard Latin authors, whom he later quoted liberally in his <span class="italic">Resolves</span>. Although one of his poems was included in Abraham Wright's <span class="italic">Parnassus Biceps</span> (1656), a collection of verse by Oxford and Cambridge alumni, no record exists of Felltham's having attended either university. By 1621 he was established as a merchant in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, London. On 10 October of that year, at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, he married Mary Clopton of Kentwell Hall, Melford, Suffolk, and on 29 August 1622 their daughter Mary was baptized in St Dionis  (Bergquist, 233&#150;4). Apparently both Felltham's wife and his daughter predeceased him; there is no mention of either in his will.<br>
<br>In 1623 the first edition of Felltham's <span class="italic">Resolves: Divine, Morall, Politicall</span> (entered in the Stationers' register on 26 May) was published, without a date on the title-page, by the London bookseller Henry Seile. It consists of 100 brief moral musings, or essays, each concluding with a resolve designed to better the writer's future conduct. Although its engraved allegorical title-page is primarily devoted to Christian iconography it also includes a caduceus and a merchant ship, the latter no doubt alluding to Felltham's current profession  (Bergquist, 234). The book is dedicated to Lady Dorothy Crane, daughter of Sir Henry Hobart, lord chief justice of the common pleas. It was no doubt during his years as a merchant that Felltham visited the Netherlands and wrote his largely satirical <span class="italic">A brief character of the Low-Countries under the states. Being three weeks observation of the vices and vertues of the inhabitants</span>, which was widely circulated in manuscript, translated into Dutch, and first printed in a pirated truncation in 1648 and issued in an authorized edition in 1652.<br>
<br>During his years in London, Felltham met Sir Kenelm Digby, his wife, Venetia, Ben Jonson, and Jonson's young friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Thomas Randolph, who wrote a poem in praise of Felltham and his <span class="italic">Resolves</span>. By this time Felltham was also writing poetry, and over the next several years a number of his elegiac and commendatory verses appeared in print: a poem in praise of the translator Kingsmill Long in the first publication in English of Barclay's <span class="italic">Argenis</span> (1625), an elegy on the death of Roland Cotton in <span class="italic">Parentalia</span> (1635), a tribute to Robert Dover and his Cotswold games in <span class="italic">Annalia Dubrensia</span> (1636), and elegiac tributes to Randolph in <span class="italic">Poems with the Muses Looking-Glass</span> (1638) and to Jonson in <span class="italic">Jonsonus virbius</span> (1638). In addition an early version of his poem on the nature of true happiness was prefaced to Edward Benlowes's <span class="italic">Theophila</span> (1652); his witty answer to Ben Jonson's ode &#145;Come leave the loathed stage&#146; was included in <span class="italic">Parnassus Biceps</span> (1656); and his accomplished love lyric beginning &#145;When, dearest, I but think on thee&#146; was mistakenly included in <span class="italic">The Last Remains of Sir John Suckling</span> (1659).<br>
<br>By 1625 Felltham had become acquainted with Barnabas O'Brien, a younger brother of the Irish fifth earl of Thomond; both men witnessed the will of O'Brien's mother-in-law on 13 August of that year. About 1628 O'Brien purchased the manor at Great Billing, Northamptonshire, and Felltham became steward of that estate, a position he held until his death. Until the 1640s O'Brien, who succeeded his brother as sixth earl of Thomond in 1639, was largely an absentee owner, dividing his time between Ireland and London, and Felltham probably lived most of his time at Great Billing, overseeing the estate and collecting rents. He was probably there in 1628 when Seile issued the much enlarged second edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span>; on the errata page the printer notes that &#145;The Authors absence ha's made faults multiply&#146;. To the original 100 resolves, now designated &#145;The first century&#146;, this 1628 edition adds a &#145;Second Century&#146; of lengthier, individually titled &#145;excogitations&#146;, or extended meditations, thereby quadrupling the size of the book. These new pieces are dedicated to Thomas, Lord Coventry, baron of Alesborough and lord keeper of the great seal, upon whose death in 1640 Felltham wrote a glowing elegiac tribute. For this second edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span> an entirely new allegorical title-page was executed. Tellingly it omits all references to commerce and instead proclaims Felltham's place among the gentry by including the family arms. This expanded edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span> must have been quite popular. Later in 1628 Seile issued a third, slightly revised edition of the book, with the order and designation of the centuries reversed, individual titles added to the original resolves of 1623, and a subject index appended to the whole. In this format and text <span class="italic">Resolves</span> was republished four additional times before the interregnum (in 1632, 1634, 1636, and 1647).<br>
<br>Throughout his adult life Felltham was an ardent adherent of the established church. In the 1628 excogitation &#145;On the choice of religion&#146; he writes:<blockquote>Among all the Diversities in Religion, that the world holds, I thinke, it may stand with most safety, to take that, which makes most for Gods Glory, and Mans quiet. I confesse in all the Treatises of Religion, that I ever saw, I find none that I should so soone follow, as that of the Church of England. (O. Felltham, <span class="italic">Resolves</span>, 2nd edn, 1628, no. 16)</blockquote>He rejects Roman Catholicism because it &#145;disdeifies&#146; God  (ibid.) and the separatist puritan because he &#145;would exclude order, that his braine might rule&#146;  (ibid., no. 5). In 1637 William Johnson, an Englishman at the Jesuit college in Cadiz, wrote to Felltham expressing admiration for some parts of <span class="italic">Resolves</span> but deploring his attitude toward Roman Catholicism. Felltham's answer, many times longer than Johnson's letter, upholds the position of the Church of England, supporting his argument with an impressive number of citations from biblical and post-biblical authority, including Roman Catholic&#151;particularly Jesuit&#151;writers. This exchange was published in the eighth edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span> (1661). Felltham was stunned and angered by the events of the 1640s. When parliament implicitly abolished the celebration of Christmas by sitting on that day in 1643 he wrote an indignant poem, protesting against the outrage. Reacting to the execution of Archbishop Laud in 1645 he wrote an impassioned Latin epitaph which concludes with the statement that with Laud lie buried, for a season, the grandeur of the kingdom, the defence of the cavaliers, the freedom of the subjects, and the safety of Britain.<br>
<br>Felltham's adherence to the Stuart monarchy was as strong as his devotion to the Church of England. Even more impassioned than his poem on the execution of Laud was his reaction to the execution of Charles I, delivered in an English elegy that, after thoroughly berating the actions of &#145;a perfidious Part of His prevalent Subjects&#146;, concludes &#145;Here Charles the First, and Christ the second lyes&#146;. Because of his political and religious beliefs Felltham must have found his employment with the O'Briens congenial. Both Barnabas and his son Henry (who succeeded to the title on his father's death in 1657) were royalist and Anglican but it was probably the Countess Mary (1592&#150;1675) for whom he felt the greatest affinity. While her husband and later her son accommodated themselves to parliament and then to Cromwell, no doubt to ensure the continued possession of their estates, the countess remained, like Felltham, a fervent royalist and Anglican in her personal convictions. After the O'Brien family set up residence at Great Billing in 1641 she and Felltham must have been in daily contact, and since throughout the 1640s and 1650s the church at Great Billing was in the hands of a fervent Presbyterian, she seems to have employed Felltham as a kind of lay chaplain. At some time after parliament banned the use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in private households in 1645 Felltham prepared &#145;A form of prayer compos'd for the family of the Right Honourable the countess of Thomond&#146;. In it he amends, augments, and domesticates the Anglican services of morning and evening prayer, simultaneously avoiding the letter of the law while providing the countess with essentially Anglican forms of worship. She allowed him to print this liturgy in a few presentation copies of the 1661 <span class="italic">Resolves</span>, where he remarks in &#145;To the reader&#146; that it &#145;was made use of, when the Liturgy of the Church, was, as the Church it self in the <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, forc'd to flie into the wilderness&#146;. &#145;A form of prayer&#146; and the prefatory reference to it were not included in copies of the book intended for public sale, and Felltham's liturgy was not published at large&#151;and then in a slightly emended form&#151;until the twelfth edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span> in 1709.<br>
<br>In 1661 Felltham published the eighth edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span> in a handsome folio that was obviously intended to be a volume of record. It contains the 1628 century of resolves unchanged, a thorough revision and expansion of some of the 1623 resolves (along with wholly new pieces) that forms a new century of eighty-five essays, two discourses on biblical passages, and (in a few presentation copies) &#145;A form of prayer&#146;. Appended to it is a separate section entitled <span class="italic">Lusoria, or, Occasional Pieces</span>, which collects his poems, <span class="italic">A Brief Character of the Low-Countries</span>, letters, and a Latin epitaph for himself. The book is dedicated to the dowager countess of Thomond, &#145;out of the sense of Duty&#146;, since most of its parts had been &#145;Composed under the Coverture of your Roof, and so born Subjects under your Dominion&#146;.<br>
<br>In his last years Felltham divided his time between the Thomond seat at Great Billing and the dowager countess's town house in the Strand. The Northamptonshire manor became a favourite of courtiers of Charles II, and on at least one occasion the duke of York (later James II) was entertained there. Joseph Williamson, successively Latin secretary and secretary of state in the 1660s, and Edmund King, personal physician to Charles II, were frequent guests. These two men witnessed Felltham's last will and testament, signed on 4 May 1667. The extent and nature of the bequests to family members and friends reveal that Felltham had become modestly wealthy in the service of the O'Briens. He instructs that where his body &#145;shall fall to Earth I am Content that in that parish there the Trunke be laid, the sooner after my decease the better in the Church or any where, where my executor pleases&#146;. Although he asks to be buried &#145;with as litle Ceremony as decently may be&#146;, he also requests that an &#145;Annexed Inscription &hellip; be sett up in the wall neere the place where I shall be Interred&#146;  (will). Felltham died in London on 23 February 1668 at the house of the dowager countess and was buried the next day in St Martin-in-the-Fields. The annexed inscription is missing from both the holographic and the probate copies of his will, and any memorial tablet that may have been erected is now lost, but Felltham was probably referring to a copy of the Latin epitaph for himself that was published under the heading &#145;Quod in sepulchrum volui&#146; as the last item in the 1661 edition of <span class="italic">Resolves</span>. In it he recalls that in his lifetime he saw sin prosper while virtue presented its head to the axe, but he is able to rejoice that he also lived to see the injustice of man eventually reordered justly by God in the restoration of the monarchy. As is quite evident from his epitaph Felltham's life was profoundly influenced by the interconnected political and religious controversies of his day, as was most of what he wrote.<br>
<br>In its 1661 form <span class="italic">Resolves</span> was published a further four times after Felltham's death (in 1670, 1677, 1696, and 1709), and between 1800 and 1840 several abridgements and putatively complete editions appeared in both England and America. The only twentieth-century edition is that by Oliphant Smeaton (1904), allegedly based on the second edition (1628) but actually following the third (also 1628). <span class="italic">A Brief Character of the Low-Countries</span> was published separately, in both English and Dutch, several times during the seventeenth century. In 1973 Ted-Larry Pebworth and Claude J. Summers published an annotated edition of <span class="italic">The Poems of Owen Felltham</span>, and in 1986 Pebworth published a critical edition of &#145;A form of prayer&#146;.<br>
<br>From Felltham's <span class="italic">Resolves</span> emerges the portrait of a Christian stoic, but one who is not pietistic. As he states in the 1628 excogitation &#145;Of puritans&#146; (no. 5), &#145;A bounded mirth, is a Pattent adding time and happinesse to the crazed life of Man&#146;. Writing with a poet's prose and enlivening his own words with liberal quotations from classical and contemporaneous authorities Felltham documents his commitment to the search for the attributes that make up a good life in an &#145;Age of loosenesse&#146;  (dedication, 1623). Throughout he considers such perennial subjects as humility, friendship, good and bad ends, the nature of the Christian life, the vanity and shortness of human life, and the preparation for death. But he also comments upon such topical concerns as puritanism, the propriety of ceremonialism, and the fall and restoration of anointed kings. What he has to say is rarely original; rather it is a thoughtful and carefully crafted distillation of a conservative Englishman's view of life in the earlier seventeenth century. <span class="italic">A Brief Character of the Low-Countries</span> focuses on baser stuff, but the same concept of what man can and should be underlies its light tone and often extravagant play with language. In it the Dutch are time and again criticized because they lack order, degree, and moderation in their private lives, their family relationships, their churches, and their state. Felltham's poems are of interest both for their often insightful comments on famous people and important events and for their lyricism. At his best he treats old themes with freshness and vitality. A professed amateur of letters, Felltham has no claim to status beyond that of minor poet, but such a ranking in a period as rich in poetry as his is not to be despised.<br>
