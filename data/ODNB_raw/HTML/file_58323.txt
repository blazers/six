<span class="headword">Becher, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">diplomat and government official</span>, was the grandson of a London alderman and the eldest son of William Becher, a London merchant tailor, and Judith Quarles, daughter of another merchant tailor. He was baptized at St Lawrence Jewry, London, on 4 May 1580. Educated at Westminster School as befitted the son of a prosperous city family, Becher matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 10 October 1594 and graduated BA in 1597. He entered the Inner Temple the following year.<br>
<br>Becher remained close to Westminster's schoolmaster William Camden. He wrote news letters to Camden and often served as a middleman in Camden's contacts with continental intellectuals. Becher had a substantial reputation as a news writer and intelligencer among a wide circle of contemporaries, including the news writers John Chamberlain and George Garrard.<br>
<br>Becher's first diplomatic post was as a messenger in Sir George Carew's embassy to Paris between 1606 and 1608. Becher had been recommended to Carew by Sir Michael Hicks, a client of Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury, secretary of state, and lord treasurer. Becher supervised Salisbury's son and heir in Paris and during travels on the continent while also writing news to the father. Left in Paris as agent when Carew was recalled, Becher was not employed by the new ambassador, Sir Thomas Edmondes. Desperate for a position, two years later he was back in Paris as tutor to Henry, Lord Clifford, only son of the fourth earl of Cumberland and son-in-law of Salisbury. Henri IV's assassination during this time inspired Becher to write a romance about the king's life and loves. In 1614 Becher was a candidate for a duchy of Lancaster seat at Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in the Addled Parliament, likely through the influence of the Slingsby family, local duchy officials, whom he had met in Paris. That same year Becher was sent by Secretary Winwood with Sir John Merricke's embassy to Muscovy, where he was miserably unhappy for the next two years. But in 1617 he was back in London, in touch with the rapidly rising new royal favourite George Villiers, who may also have met Becher in Paris, and through Villiers's good offices secured the post of English agent in France on the departure of Edmondes. Becher was soon recalled, however, as relations between England and France deteriorated.<br>
<br>Becher sat in the parliament of 1621, having been nominated for two seats, one in the gift of Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, the patron of Camden as Garter king at arms, and the other in the gift of Villiers. Becher chose to accept Villiers's continued patronage, deepening a relationship that endured until the favourite's assassination. Becher was selected on Villiers patronage to every parliament of the 1620s and was one of the duke's most active and vocal defenders in the house and out, to the extent that his fellow MPs considered him little more than the duke's mouthpiece. In 1622 Becher was knighted and accompanied Lord Chichester's embassy to the Palatinate and early in 1623, once again through Buckingham's favour, obtained the post of clerk to the privy council to replace Sir Albertus Morton. But Becher had apparently not completely abandoned his intellectual aspirations since, on the heels of this appointment, he was rumoured to be in hot contention with many of the leading intellectuals of the day for the provostship of Eton College. He had Buckingham's strong support for this position too, but Buckingham, beset by suitors and mired in numerous complicated patronage deals not to mention a trip to Spain, changed his mind, preferring Sir Henry Wotton instead. Becher was compensated with a &pound;2500 payment, reversions to other offices, and continuance in the post of council clerk and Buckingham's good graces.<br>
<br>As a council clerk, Becher was considered to have financial and organizational acumen, and perhaps even a genetic predisposition to these talents as he came from a family of merchants who had also been defence contractors and speculators. Becher was involved in the planning and preparations for all of Buckingham's military expeditions in the 1620s. He was chosen secretary to the council of war in 1624 and, as such, treasurer for Mansfeld's expedition to the Palatinate, which he accompanied in person to report on the mission. Subsequently he seems to have been involved in Charles I's marriage negotiations in France with another old Paris acquaintance, Sir Henry Rich, now earl of Holland, and in June 1625 it was Becher who publicly read the declaration of the king's marriage at Whitehall. In December 1626 Becher sailed with the Rh&eacute; fleet as Buckingham's personal secretary and was at the centre of the negotiations with the Rochellois. It was Becher whom Buckingham sent back to England the following summer to obtain further funding and reinforcements for this mission, a task frustrated by lack of funds and bureaucracy, both of which Becher worked furiously to overcome. He returned with little money, few provisions, and few men, and, when the mission ended, was then assigned to disband what was left of Buckingham's army when it returned to England. Becher expected to sail with the duke's planned 1628 expedition as well, despite a severe attack of kidney stones during the final preparations.<br>
<br>After Buckingham's assassination in 1628, Becher retained the favour of the king, who kept him on as a council clerk and master of requests in extraordinary, and honoured the grants and reversions issued to Becher by the deceased favourite as much as a decade later. In the council office, he served a number of commissions concerned with financial matters including the treasury commission of 1635&#150;6. Becher was also clerk to the Irish committee of the council which brought him into contact with Robert Boyle, first earl of Cork, one of the wealthiest men in the three kingdoms. Cork paid Becher &pound;40 a year to look after his business in the committee and to report to him on other business there. This relationship grew to include private investments and other business deals that benefited Becher's fortunes.<br>
<br>In 1640 Becher had a brush with the investigations undertaken by the Long Parliament and, after a few days in the Fleet, decided to confess he had been in error and divest himself of his clerk's position. While the king, short of money himself, opposed Becher's attempts to sell the office for personal profit, he was apparently not sorry to see Becher go. There is no indication, as Gerald Aylmer asserted, that Becher was forced out because he was suspected of being a Catholic; his greatest sin seems to have been that he was an ageing royalist. Becher's clerkship was sold to Sir Richard Browne, the royal agent in Paris, and Becher himself spent the war years in and out of England and France. Despite comments about his advancing age and declining health, he apparently suffered no impediment in offering to sell guns to the earl of Cork in 1643 or when smuggling guns to the king's forces between 1643 and 1645 from his perch in Rouen. Becher's estate and activities were investigated by the committee for the advancement of money in 1649, although the outcome of their proceedings is unknown. Becher died in 1651 at his home in Putney where he was buried before the high altar in Putney church. Becher never married, but named one natural son, also William Becher, a lawyer, in his will. Taxes of &pound;1000 had been assessed on his estate in 1646 and 1647, indicating that it was substantial. The will left legacies of more than &pound;1250 to his sisters and their children, &pound;300 for poor clergy, and the rest to his son.<br>
