<span class="headword">Somerville <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gibb]</span>,  Euphemia Gilchrist</span>  (1860&#150;1935), <span class="occ">social worker and local politician</span>, was born on 19 September 1860 in New Town, Dollar, Clackmannanshire, the daughter of William Gibb, a draper, and his wife, Margaret Scott McMinn. She was educated at Dollar Academy, where she won a number of prizes. On 28 June 1893 she married Alexander Somerville (1841/2&#150;1907), a retired East India merchant, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26017/', "Alexander Neil Somerville")</script>, a Free Church minister. They had two sons and a daughter. Her husband, a widower with three daughters, had taken up the study of botany after his retirement from business. After his death in 1907 Euphemia Somerville and her children moved to Edinburgh and from 1911 lived in Colinton. The introduction to <span class="italic">A Child Lover</span> (1937), an appreciation published after her death, stated that her experience of child poverty in Glasgow was the motivation for all her work. Her first public role was in Glasgow where, in response to high rates of infant mortality, she organized voluntary health visitors on behalf of the city council. She was asked to develop a similar scheme in Edinburgh in 1908, and with Mrs Hamilton Maxwell started the Edinburgh Voluntary Health Workers' Association, under the auspices of the council child welfare scheme.<br>
<br>Euphemia Somerville was elected to the town council for the Merchiston ward in 1919 as an independent, actively supported by the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association (EWCA). The EWCA was set up in 1918, after women were partially enfranchised, to educate and organize the new women voters. It was ambitious, with interests encompassing women's political representation at local and national level, equal pay, and social welfare, especially for women as mothers and for children, but also mental handicap, social housing, and public health. When she was first elected she went to live for a month in the Craiglockhart poorhouse &#145;in order that she might obtain first-hand information on this side of Social Service&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Child Lover</span>, 11), and then took a diploma at the new school of social study and training at the University of Edinburgh, a course that was aimed at both professional and voluntary social workers and taken by many women active in social reform. On the council, she was a member at various times of the education, public health, housing, and town planning and public parks committees. A colleague said that she was seen as &#145;a party of one&#151;viz. herself&#146;  (ibid., 41), and that this limited her influence and preferment. Mrs Hamilton Maxwell saw her, however, as &#145;unconfused by political interest or side issues&#146;  (ibid., 14). As well as being the second woman councillor in the city, holding her seat until her death, she also became in 1932 the city's second woman bailie, or magistrate, after several attempts. When she took this position, the &#145;woman of the streets was the subject of Mrs Somerville's special personal attention&#146;  (ibid., 44).<br>
<br>Somerville chaired the executive committee of the EWCA from 1922 to 1930. Her multiple roles illustrate a mutually reinforcing relationship between women in local politics and women's organizations. By 1926 she was pushing for more council housing within the corporation and had set up the EWCA subcommittee on housing, through which she launched the Edinburgh Welfare Housing Trust in 1928 to build &#145;good houses for the very poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Child Lover</span>, 55) as a model of what councils could do. By 1934 the trust had built on four city sites. Accounts of that work hint that her determination over housing, particularly slum clearance, bordered on the obsessive. After her death it was said that &#145;the vast new housing schemes that now detract from the landscape around Edinburgh&#146; were her reward  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 1 Dec 1937)&#151;an ambiguous legacy but one that indicated a response to housing conditions of the time. In the introduction to a survey of the St Andrews ward in Edinburgh (just behind the smart shops in Princes Street), commissioned by the EWCA in 1931 and undertaken by two women chartered surveyors, Somerville wrote that they wanted &#145;to bring out in strong relief the environment of the child in overcrowded insanitary areas&#146;  (E. E. Perry and I. T. Barclay, <span class="italic">Behind Princes Street</span>, 1931, 5). Such concerns were also acted on by the Edinburgh corporation public health committee. After May 1930 the committee's responsibilities included administration of the municipal hospitals and all services for mental health and handicap. As the first convener of the new mental diseases subcommittee (1930&#150;32), which administered two major institutions, Bangour Mental Hospital and Gogarburn, and their auxiliary services, Somerville championed progressive approaches to the care and treatment of the mentally ill and handicapped.<br>
<br>Somerville was best known in Edinburgh for the toddlers' playgrounds of which, at her death, there were nineteen. They grew out of her work in health visiting, as toddlers were often neglected when a new baby came and also had high rates of mortality. The playgrounds offered supervision, &#145;exercise, fresh air, and happy occupation&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Child Lover</span>, 18). Edinburgh was a pioneer in pre-school provision, having established in 1903 the first free kindergarten in Scotland, at Reid's Court, Canongate, and by 1913 it had five voluntarily funded child gardens, as they were called, there being only fourteen in the rest of Britain. However, with an estimated 4000 children under five living in crowded rooms in densely populated districts, cheaper provision was needed through the playgrounds and after-school play centres. From 1930 Somerville convened a special committee on the care and education of children up to five. She commissioned a survey of children's health in the poorer areas, information that was used to argue for council nursery schools, the first of which was built in 1930 and is still open.<br>
<br>Somerville was similarly assiduous in the cause of equal pay and promotion for women employees of the council, on which the EWCA lobbied. In 1928 she was described as steadily and persistently pursuing equal increments for corporation clerical employees. She also argued for women and men to be represented on all boards and charitable bodies, and for council advisory committees in key areas with equal numbers of men and women members.<br>
<br>The boundary between voluntary work, voluntary associations, and the local state was permeable at this time and one which many &#145;organized women&#146; (as the EWCA called itself) crossed. In Edinburgh Somerville was the pre-eminent example of this activity, as she brought into local government her own early experience of voluntary health visiting. The influence of women and women's organizations on welfare policy was arguably at a height during the inter-war period, when poor relief, voluntary hospitals, public health, and children's health and welfare (through educational provision) were all locally administered. Somerville espoused campaigns for aged persons, rent rebates according to the number of children in a family, social centres in the new housing areas, and the appointment of women police officers. She was also a director of the Royal Maternity and Simpson Memorial Hospital, where she was seen as possessing expertise in maternal mortality, birthrate fluctuations, and venereal disease; she was a link between the hospital and the council's public health department. Although babies and small children were undoubtedly a priority in her work, to emphasize her role as a &#145;child lover&#146; is to underplay her organizational and leadership skills and the expertise she developed in several areas of health and welfare. She was a &#145;practical visionary&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Child Lover</span>, 15), with immense vitality, a notable thoroughness, and, according to Mrs Hamilton Maxwell, &#145;a genius for accuracy&#146;. What she called practical Christianity was a central motivation, and in <span class="italic">Citizenship</span> (n.d.), a pamphlet she wrote for the EWCA, she emphasized the importance of collectivity and citizenship as &#145;the gospel and practice of inter-relationships&#146;.<br>
<br>Euphemia Somerville died at her home, 27 Colinton Road, Edinburgh, on 27 September 1935. The herbarium of British plants she and her husband had collected was presented to the University of Edinburgh.<br>
