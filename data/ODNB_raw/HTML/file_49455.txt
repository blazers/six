<span class="headword">Cooke,  Joseph</span>  (1775&#150;1811), <span class="occ">religious reformer and founder of the Methodist Unitarian Movement</span>, was born near Dudley, Worcestershire, on 8 May 1775. His parents were poor, and his education was &#145;not what is generally esteemed a learned one&#146;  (Ashworth, 11). In 1799 he married Martha (1772/3&#150;1849); they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Converted to Methodism at an early age, Cooke took up local preaching so successfully that he was taken on trial as an itinerant preacher by the Methodist conference meeting in 1795 and was appointed to Redruth in Cornwall, to St Austell in 1796, and in 1798 to Burslem, Staffordshire. In 1799 he was admitted as a full preacher and served acceptably in Brecon and Chester circuits. In August 1803 he went to Rochdale circuit, which was centred on the Union Street Chapel. Constant itinerancy helped secure uniformity, as a preacher did not remain long enough to impress upon the members his particular views or methods. However, Cooke had his own views, and his rational and orderly method of examining the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the tenets of Methodism soon attracted wide and popular attention.<br>
<br>Two sermons preached at Rochdale early in 1805 caused immediate trouble, and complaints led to Cooke's being called to account at the conference held at Sheffield in August. The sermons centred on justification by faith and the witness of the spirit. John Wesley had taught early in his career that unless a justified sinner felt his sins were forgiven by personal assurance, his way of life was of no avail to salvation; Cooke preached that when someone believed and was penitent, but was not conscious of God's pardon, he was still freely forgiven. Wesley seemed to follow this line later in his life, but Methodists were split on the matter and Cooke had touched a raw nerve. He strongly defended himself, and after much discussion stated that he would leave these matters alone for one year. On this basis he was appointed to the Sunderland circuit. However Cooke did preach on these subjects and published the two controversial sermons in Rochdale only months afterwards, with a contentious preface.<br>
<br>At the 1806 conference Cooke was expelled with accusations on both sides of bad faith. He returned to Rochdale with a wife and family to support and no income. However, many of his hearers at Union Street Chapel seceded, and in the same year opened Providence Chapel in the High Street in which he could minister. At the opening service he stated: &#145;This chapel was built and opened, not for the purpose of preaching any system of doctrines taught by man, but for the purpose of communicating those truths, which after a diligent and impartial enquiry, may appear to me to be contained in the <span class="roman">Scriptures</span>&#146;  (McLachlan, <span class="italic">Methodist Unitarian Movement</span>, 16&#150;17). Cooke was feeling his way theologically, and &#145;if he did not arrive at Unitarianism by the time of his death, at least he moved steadily in that direction&#146;  (ibid., 16).<br>
<br>Cooke preached widely in remote parts of Lancashire north of Manchester, and particularly at Newchurch in Rossendale, where a room was opened at Mill End in 1807 by his supporter John Ashworth (1779&#150;1852), another ejected Methodist local preacher. By late 1809 Cooke had developed tuberculosis, and died in Rochdale on 14 March 1811. He was buried in the aisle of Providence Chapel. All his children had died by 1834, and there were no descendants.<br>
<br>Cooke had started what became known as the Methodist Unitarian Movement (the Cookites), developed in the next decade by Ashworth, James Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1856), and James Wilkinson (1787&#150;1858). The Cookites first came to the attention of Unitarians as a result of an article in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> in May 1815. In 1818 the minister of the old Presbyterian congregation in Rochdale stated &#145;May not Mr Cooke be considered as the father of Unitarianism in the town?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, April 1818, 262). The movement revivified the old Presbyterian chapels in the area, and while by the 1840s it was spent as a separate force, its dynamic had made a significant impact on old dissent in Lancashire. A high proportion of the Rochdale Pioneers who in 1844 laid the basis for the modern co-operative movement were strongly influenced by the distinctive Methodist Unitarian approach to religion.<br>
