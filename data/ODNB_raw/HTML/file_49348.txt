<span class="headword">Martineau, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1828&#150;1893), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 4 November 1828 in Bristol Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, the son of Robert Martineau, a manufacturer and prominent local figure, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Samuel Smith, another local industrialist. A descendant of a Huguenot family that had settled in Norwich during the late seventeenth century, Martineau was a nephew of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18229/', "Revd James Martineau")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18228/', "Harriet Martineau")</script>. On the death of the latter he became sole literary executor and co-executor of her estate with his brother. Martineau grew up in and remained a prominent member of Birmingham's Liberal and Unitarian circle. He was educated at the Birmingham and Edgbaston proprietary school (1838&#150;44), where he developed a close friendship with Alfred Wills, who later became a judge and well-known alpinist. At school they set up and ran a library, a magazine, and later a debating society.<br>
<br>Martineau left school in 1844 and was articled to Arthur Ryland, solicitor of Birmingham, and his mother's first cousin. From 1849 his legal education continued with Ryland's agents in London, Sharpe, Field &amp; Co., and later in the chambers of the conveyancer, John Wilson, and the special pleader, T. H. Baylis. He was admitted in 1851 and immediately joined Ryland in partnership, the firm being known as Ryland and Martineau until the death of Ryland in 1877. Martineau succeeded his late partner to the prestigious post as law clerk of the Birmingham assay office. By this time he had achieved a high reputation in the local profession. However, it was not until this point in his career that he became fully active in the public life of Birmingham. Nevertheless, he had exhibited a keen interest in local affairs since the 1850s and had taken his first steps in the political and cultural life of the town. Soon after qualifying he became active in local Liberal politics, later acting as an election agent. It was also at this time that Martineau was a member (and later president) of the Birmingham and Edgbaston Debating Society. It was through this society that he was to develop a friendship with Joseph Chamberlain. About the year 1860 he was elected to the council of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, which had been established by his partner, Ryland, in 1853. Martineau subsequently held office as honorary secretary and vice-president. In 1860 he married Emily, daughter of Timothy Kenrick, a hardware manufacturer of West Bromwich. Her sisters were married to Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Gabriel Beale.<br>
<br>In 1876, Martineau entered the town council as representative for the Edgbaston ward and began a notable municipal career, which illustrates well the important role of eminent solicitors in provincial public life. In 1883 he was elected alderman and in 1884 became mayor for the first time. He was re-elected in 1885 and again in 1886. In addition to being thrice mayor he served on a variety of committees, his legal knowledge and experience proving invaluable. Indeed, the three major improvement projects for which he became widely known saw a convergence of his professional and political interests and drew extensively on his professional skills. As chairman of the parliamentary committee in 1882 Martineau took responsibility for the <span class="roman">Birmingham Consolidation Bill</span>. This measure affecting the government of Birmingham engendered considerable local opposition which continued through the courts and both houses of parliament. Much of the parliamentary work fell to Martineau, which necessitated a stay in London of several weeks to monitor the progress of the bill and shepherd it through its various stages.<br>
<br>It was, perhaps, with the creation of Birmingham as an assize town and the erection of the Victoria Law Courts in Corporation Street that Martineau attracted most public recognition. As a member of the Birmingham Law Society he had been active in the promotion of an assize scheme and made his maiden speech in the town council on the subject. After much debate and several attempts, assize status was granted in 1884. Though assizes were commenced soon afterwards, it was not until 1887 that building work on the new courts was started. Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone during her jubilee year and was received by Martineau as mayor. Two days later, on 25 March 1887, the honour of a knighthood was conferred upon him at Windsor.<br>
<br>The third project with which Martineau was associated again drew heavily on his legal expertise and negotiating skills. The Birmingham water scheme required his attendance before the House of Commons select committee on the bill. He successfully piloted the bill through parliament in 1892, but was to die before the scheme was started.<br>
<br>Martineau was involved in many other local movements and aspects of civic life. He held positions on the governing bodies of numerous charitable, educational, and cultural organizations. He was appointed a borough justice in 1880 and acted regularly until his death. A keen gardener, he established the Gardeners' Association of which he was first president. Towards the end of his life he was president of the midland iron and steel wages board; a further recognition of his local prominence and abilities in arbitration and negotiation. In the late 1880s he served on the royal commission on market rights and tolls.<br>
<br>Martineau's health began to deteriorate in 1888, but he did not retire from practice until the beginning of 1893. He died on 28 July 1893 at his residence, West Hill, Augustus Road, Edgbaston; he was survived by his wife, Lady Martineau, and his children, Ernest and Clara.<br>
