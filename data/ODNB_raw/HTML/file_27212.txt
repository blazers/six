<span class="headword">Thomas,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Dafydd Ddu Eryri]</span>  (1759&#150;1822), <span class="occ">poet and schoolmaster</span>, was born in Y Waunfawr, Caernarvonshire, the son of Thomas Gruffydd (1716&#150;1781), a weaver, and his wife, Mary Humphreys (1714&#150;1794). His early education was sketchy. In 1774 he was taught for eight months by John Morgan, the curate of Llanberis, where he met Abraham Williams 
    (Bardd Du Eryri; 1755&#150;1828)
  , who introduced him to Welsh poetry and loaned him books and some of the manuscript collections he had inherited from the scholar&#150;cleric Dafydd Ellis (1736&#150;1795), curate at Llanberis before John Morgan. Thomas followed his father's craft for some years, later teaching in his home village and nearby areas.<br>
<br>In Caernarfon, Thomas met the poet Robert Hughes 
    (Robin Ddu yr Ail o F&ocirc;n; <i>d</i>. 1785)
  , who had moved to the town in 1783 after having worked for twenty years in London as a legal clerk. Hughes was a co-founder of the London Gwyneddigion Society. From him Dafydd Ddu heard of the social and literary meetings enjoyed by the Welsh literati in London and he sent out his own invitation to a meeting of poets at his home in Betws Garmon. From this developed the &#145;school of Dafydd Ddu&#146;, whose members were popularly known as Dafydd Ddu's chicks. He won the main prize for an <i>awdl</i> (a long poem in selected strict metres) in the St Asaph and Llanrwst eisteddfodau of 1790 and 1791, held under the auspices of the Gwyneddigion. These poems were accepted as templates for the form, and the poet's prestige as a mentor of authority was now assured, with his influence extending beyond Caernarvonshire.<br>
<br>Dafydd Ddu could write fluently in the free, alliterative metres, but he was mainly concerned to refurbish the native strict metres. He emphasized correctness of language, style, and metre, with tight control of imagination, circulated his own bardic grammar among his disciples, and travelled extensively to further his aims. He would even legislate on content, such was his desire to offer clear guidance to bardic pupils. As a poet his work has outlived its appeal, but he brought valuable influence to bear at a time when knowledge of <i>cerdd dafod</i>, the unique strict-metre system, had deteriorated and there was a real need for a bardic teacher of unchallengeable authority. His work as a critic makes him an important link between his idol, Goronwy Owen (1723&#150;1769), the leader of the eighteenth-century neo-classical revival, and the early eisteddfod poets of the nineteenth century. On 4 November 1803 he married Elinor Thomas; they had no children. A collection of his poems, including some by others, <span class="italic">Corph y gaingc</span>, was published in 1810, a second edition appearing posthumously in 1834.<br>
<br>David Thomas died as the result of a riding accident, at Llanrug, where he was living, on 30 March 1822. He was buried there on 2 April.<br>
