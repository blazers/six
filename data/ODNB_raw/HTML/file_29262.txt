<span class="headword">White, Sir  Michael</span>  (1791&#150;1868), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at St Michael's Mount, Cornwall, was the third son of Robert White, major in the 27th dragoons, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir John St Aubyn, fourth baronet (1726&#150;1772), of St Michael's Mount. He was educated at Westminster School, and obtained a cornetcy in the 24th light dragoons on 15 August 1804. On 14 May 1805 he was promoted lieutenant. He went to India, and was engaged in active service in 1809 in the campaigns along the Sutlej. On 7 November 1815 he attained his captaincy, and in 1816 he married Mary, daughter of Major Mylne of the 24th light dragoons. In 1817 he was present at the capture of Hathras. He served through the Maratha campaign of 1817&#150;18, and at the siege and capture of Bharatpur in 1825&#150;6. He was promoted major on 10 January 1837, and lieutenant-colonel on 13 December 1839. He commanded the cavalry throughout the Afghan campaign of 1842, accompanying the army under General Sir George Pollock which forced the Khyber Pass, stormed the heights at Jagdalak, defeated the enemy at Tezin, captured the fortified position at Haft Kotal in the pass, and occupied Kabul. After the campaign, on 29 December 1842, he was nominated CB. He served in the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1845&#150;6, under Sir Hugh Gough. He commanded the cavalry at the battle of Mudki on 18 December 1845, when his horse was wounded. At the battle of Ferozeshahr on 21 December, where he commanded a brigade, he was wounded and had his horse killed under him, and at Sobraon he behaved with such bravery that he was nominated aide-de-camp to the queen. He became colonel on 1 April 1846.<br>
<br>In 1848 the Second Anglo-Sikh War began, and White commanded the 1st brigade of cavalry throughout the campaign. At Ramnagar on 22 November he wisely avoided the Sikh trap which caused the deaths of General Charles Cureton and Lieutenant-Colonel William Havelock. On 13 January 1849 he was present at the expensive victory of Chilianwala, where he protected the left of the infantry, and on 21 February 1849 he took part in the victory at Gujrat. On 20 June 1854 he received the rank of major-general, and on 26 August 1858 was appointed colonel of the 7th light dragoons (hussars). On 31 August 1860 he attained the rank of lieutenant-general, and on 10 November 1862 was nominated KCB. He died at 15 Pembridge Crescent, Bayswater, London, on 27 January 1868.<br>
