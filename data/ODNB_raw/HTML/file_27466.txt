<span class="headword">Tynemouth <span class="st"> [Tinmouth]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1350), <span class="occ">chronicler</span>, is a writer of whom little is known. The best medieval tradition describes him simply as vicar of Tynemouth in Northumberland. On account of references in his chronicle, the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span>, to villages close to Wheatley in the diocese of Winchester, he might possibly be identified with a John Whetely, who was vicar of Tynemouth in the 1350s and 1360s. It is more probable, however, that our subject came from Wheatley in Yorkshire, which would explain the name, John York, which is given to the author in certain manuscripts of his work. Whatever his origins, the close connection between the vicarage at Tynemouth and the abbey of St Albans may be responsible for certain features in the manuscript tradition of the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span>. The prior of the St Albans cell at Tynemouth appointed the vicars of Tynemouth, whose vicarage formed part of the priory church. Although Horstmann's suggestion that John Tynemouth was a St Albans monk is uncertain, it is possible that Thomas de la Mare, when prior of Tynemouth from 1341 to 1349, encouraged John Tynemouth in his work. As evidence of an early association with St Albans, an abbreviated copy of the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> was known to Thomas Walsingham when he was constructing the early drafts of his <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> in the 1380s.<br>
<br>Apart from the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span>, John Tynemouth wrote a <span class="italic">Sanctilogium</span>, which contains 156 lives of British saints. A single copy, presented to the St Albans cell at Redbourn in Hertfordshire by Thomas de la Mare, survives in BL, Cotton MS Tiberius E.i. John Tynemouth's main achievement, the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span>, compiled <i>c</i>.1350, was a world history extending from the creation to 1347. In addition to a number of abbreviated versions, copies of the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> survive from Durham, Bury St Edmunds, and St Albans. In the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> (a name chosen by its author, for reasons that remain unknown) John Tynemouth gave an account of world history contained in some twenty-three chapters. Written on a larger scale than the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, it lacked the coherence of Higden's work, with which its fortunes were none the less to be associated. In constructing his chronicle John Tynemouth used a short version of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, but during the fourteenth century the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> itself became the source of a new version of Higden's text. In certain manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> the later books of the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> were combined with the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> to provide what was in effect a new edition of the latter work. Apart from its association with the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> enjoyed a modest success in its own right, and its concluding section was used in several fourteenth-century chronicles. At St Albans, however, the complete text of the <span class="italic">Historia aurea</span> does not appear to have been known until the fifteenth century, indicating that John Tynemouth himself may not have been a St Albans monk.<br>
