<span class="headword">Barry,  Ernest James</span>  (1882&#150;1968), <span class="occ">sculler</span>, was born on 13 February 1882 at 17 Hermit Road, Canning Town, London, the son of Henry Barry, lighterman, and his wife, Elizabeth Spall. While still an apprentice in 1902, he was entered for the Newcastle handicap, a sculling race on which considerable betting took place, and reached the final. He started favourite but lost by a length to Jack Dodds of Hexham, who, according to the local press, &#145;got five cuts at the water before Barry left the stakeboat&#146;. There is little doubt that Barry was held back at the word &#145;go&#146;. Coming out of his time, Barry won the 1903 Doggett's Coat and Badge &#145;pretty easily&#146; but there are no further records until 1908. Then, still a virtual novice, he raced the Australian George Towns, who had already won the world championship four times and held the British championship since 1899. Towns led the lighter Barry as far as Chiswick church but was beaten by two lengths in 21 minutes 12.4 seconds, a time for the Putney to Mortlake course which was subsequently only once bettered in seventy years.<br>
<br>Barry challenged Dick Arnst of New Zealand for the world championship in August 1910 and the pair raced over 3&frac14; miles on the Zambezi River, 5 miles above Victoria Falls. Fearing the effects of the altitude, Barry delayed his effort until the last quarter-mile but both scullers stopped 300 yards from the finish. The huge New Zealander recovered first and paddled home alone. In 1911 and 1912 Barry successfully defended the <span class="italic">Sportsman</span> challenge cup for the British championship against W. Albany of Lea Bridge and W. H. Fogwell of Australia, and in July 1912, in appalling conditions, he took his revenge on Arnst over the Putney to Mortlake course to become the first English world champion for thirty-six years. After starting at odds of three to one on, Arnst led by two lengths at Harrods, where Barry closed the gap and with superior watermanship drew level above Hammersmith. The lead changed hands several times before Chiswick steps and at the crossing to Duke's Meadows, Barry, mastering the rough water better, gained two lengths within 150 yards. Arnst was six lengths behind at Barnes Bridge but with a final effort closed to within two lengths. He could do no more, however, and stopped 80 yards from the post. The race was described as the finest professional sculling race ever seen in England.<br>
<br>Three months later Barry easily retained his title against the Canadian Edward Durnan over the same course, winning the <span class="italic">Sportsman</span> cup outright and &pound;1000. In 1913 there followed a second defence of his world title for &pound;500 a side against Harry Pearce of Australia, father of the 1928 Olympic winner and subsequent world champion Bob Pearce. Pearce led to Hammersmith but was six lengths down by Chiswick steps. One month after the outbreak of the First World War, in which he spent four years in the army, Barry beat another Australian, J. Paddon, and there were no further challengers until Felton in 1919.<br>
<br>The Zambezi River race of 1910 was Barry's sole defeat until, at the age of thirty-seven, in 1919, he lost to F. Felton of Australia, who was fitter and 2 stones heavier, when it was so rough at Putney it was possible to see under the bottom of the boats. This reverse was avenged by Barry a year later in 1920, before an estimated 150,000 spectators, on the Parramatta River, when he won by twelve lengths to gain his fifth world championship. He was, with some justice, known as the Incomparable. After his retirement as a sculler, Barry spent the rest of his working life as a professional coach in Denmark and Germany, enjoying such success that it is remarkable, and even sad, that he was never employed by British clubs. He was appointed king's bargemaster, a position from which he retired in 1952 because of ill health.<br>
<br>Over 6 feet in height, Barry still weighed no more than 11 stone 9 lb for his last race. Though a sufferer from asthma in old age, he retained full mental alertness and an upright, soldierly bearing. He married Lottie Hammerton, of Twickenham; there were two sons and three daughters of the marriage. Later in his life Barry had to sell all but two of his trophies to support himself and his daughter Thelma, who contracted poliomyelitis. He died at West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, on 21 July 1968.<br>
