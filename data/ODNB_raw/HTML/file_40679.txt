<span class="headword">Wex,  Bernard Patrick</span>  (1922&#150;1990), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 24 April 1922 in Acton, Middlesex, the only child of Julius Wex, a lace merchant from Germany, who had gone to England in 1900, taken British nationality in 1911, and in the same year married Gertrude Brady, a fashion saleswoman. His father died of pneumonia two weeks before he was born, and his mother went to live with her mother in Acton. He attended Acton county grammar school, where he showed all-round prowess, matriculating in 1938. On the outbreak of the Second World War his desire to become a Royal Air Force pilot was thwarted by minor astigmatism. After attending Sandhurst, in 1943 he became a tank commander (lieutenant) in the Royal Armoured Corps (23rd hussars). Having suffered pleurisy and pneumonia in 1944, he was transferred to administrative work until demobilization as captain in March 1947. In 1945 he married Sheila Evelyn Lambert, widow of Malcolm Kingsbury Lambert, RAF pilot, and daughter of Peter Thompson, a builder in north-west London; it was a very happy marriage, of which there were two sons. In October 1947 he was accepted by Imperial College, London, to read civil engineering and he graduated in 1950 with first-class honours, being top of his year and winning the Unwin medal.<br>
<br>Wex immediately started work with Freeman Fox &amp; Partners under Gilbert Roberts and, later, Oleg Kerensky. His early work included Auckland harbour bridge (built in 1955&#150;9) and schemes for the 1000 metre Severn and Forth suspension spans. He gained site experience on the 600 megawatt Castle Donington power station. Design work on another power station was followed by six 177 metre span oil pipeline suspension bridges in India, and a further series of bridges to carry high-pressure gas in Pakistan, including the 1770 metre multi-span River Sutlej crossing, which was built entirely in one dry season.<br>
<br>Appointed a partner in Freeman Fox in 1969, Wex oversaw construction of the M5 Avonmouth Bridge and took charge of the newly authorized Humber Bridge project. This had originally been studied by the firm in 1927&#150;8 and proposed as a single 1372 metre span by Sir Ralph Freeman in 1935. Wex directed its final design and construction, adopting &#145;slip-formed&#146; concrete for the towers, rather than steel, thus making substantial cost savings. He also used novel methods for sinking the south tower and anchorage foundations through 40 metres of water and silt to reach the Kimmeridge clay. The construction period coincided with unprecedented inflation and worsening industrial relations, which caused severe delays and mounting costs. Undaunted, Wex piloted client and contractors through to a supremely successful conclusion. The bridge was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 July 1981. At 1410 metres its main clear span was the world's longest by 110 metres. Wex was appointed OBE in the 1982 new year honours list.<br>
<br>Although the Humber Bridge was Wex's crowning achievement, he packed much else into the decade of the 1970s, including the cable-stayed box-girder Myton swing bridge in Hull and a slender 165 metre concrete arch bridge in South Africa. In 1979 he prepared a design for one of six contractors bidding in competition for the proposed River Foyle Bridge near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. His graceful 234 metre span twin-steel box-girder scheme was judged the winner for appearance by the Royal Fine Arts Commission and was also the lowest priced. The bridge was completed in October 1984.<br>
<br>Wex led the seven-year inquiry into the 1969 collapse of the 381 metre Emley Moor television mast, and served energetically on many technical committees and on the council of the Welding Institute. He contributed much to the work of the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering, chairing its British group and technical committees; it made him an honorary member in 1990. He helped to found the Steel Construction Institute in 1986 and remained its chairman until shortly before his final illness. He wrote sixteen papers on six subjects, eleven of them between 1976 and 1984, which were published in ten countries, and he delivered many lectures at home and abroad.<br>
<br>With his lifelong enthusiasm, unquenchable good humour, and first-class brain, Wex became a most proficient and successful creator of bridges, the equal of any of his time. He was a perfectionist in all he attempted, becoming a skilful photographer and cabinet-maker. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in 1956 (fellow, 1968), and a fellow of the Welding Institute, where he also took the practical welding course, in 1972. In 1982 he was elected to the Fellowship (later Royal Academy) of Engineering, and awarded the fellowship of the City and Guilds Institute. In 1985 he won the ICE's Telford gold medal and became a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers.<br>
<br>Wex was tall, of athletic build, fair-skinned with blond hair (which mostly disappeared in his early twenties), good-looking, and of extrovert personality. Wex died on 31 July 1990 in St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, while undergoing chemotherapy treatment for myeloid leukaemia. He was survived by his wife.<br>
