<span class="headword">Jude,  Martin</span>  (1803&#150;1860), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, came to prominence during disputes in the Northumberland and Durham coalfields in the late 1830s, but nothing is known about his parentage or upbringing. He belonged to a small coterie of young men who assisted Thomas Hepburn, the miners' leader, during the unsuccessful disputes of 1831&#150;2 in the great northern coalfields. Though there is no evidence he received any formal education, Jude demonstrated impressive skill and ability in formulating a cogent case and expressing ideas coherently. Consequently when another, more successful, attempt was made in 1842 to succeed where Hepburn failed, Jude emerged as a prominent figure.<br>
<br>The Miners' Association was formed at the end of 1842 and quickly grew into a trade union of unprecedented power, with 100,000 members. In March 1843, six months after its formation, when Jude became its treasurer, the association had attained national dimensions, and was represented in every coalfield. Remarkably, Jude ran its financial affairs in his spare time, working as a publican to secure his livelihood. This was an age when trade unions did not possess either strong leaderships or coherent policies, and Jude's difficulties were compounded by the fact that pitmen in each coalfield were preoccupied by their own particular grievances&#151;such as the &#145;bond&#146;, the &#145;butty system&#146;, child labour, and the &#145;tommy shops&#146;&#151;to the exclusion of the overall national situation. Getting a policy that would be followed throughout the coalfields proved virtually impossible.<br>
<br>This was one reason why Jude counselled caution. He sought to dampen the ardour of pitmen in Northumberland and Durham, where the union was strongest, when they wanted to strike against the &#145;bond&#146;. This was the year-long contract entered into by miners, who increasingly felt that the system unduly favoured the coal owners, and should be scrapped. At the Manchester and Glasgow union conferences in 1844, Jude cast doubt on the legality of the contemplated strike, questioning whether all avenues of negotiation had been exhausted, and if the ultimate outcome was likely to be what they desired. When the pitmen disregarded his strictures and stopped work, however, Jude threw himself wholeheartedly into the fight. Besides addressing mass meetings and writing to other workers' organizations for financial support, he even let the union borrow his life savings of &pound;100 which it never repaid.<br>
<br>After five months Jude's prediction proved correct. The union treasury exhausted, and donations from elsewhere drying up, the 34,000 north-east pitmen, some of whom had been evicted from their cottages and forced to subsist in roadside encampments, admitted defeat and sought their old jobs back. But the influx of strikebreakers during the dispute, combined with the dislocation of coal sales, meant fewer miners were needed. The labour surplus led to the imposition of wage cuts which, Jude calculated, varied between 15 and 33 per cent.<br>
<br>Wanting where possible to eschew industrial conflict, Jude sought to direct pitmen towards campaigning for mining legislation. He addressed many public meetings, wrote widely, and appeared before numerous parliamentary inquiries. He always advanced his arguments in a clear, rational manner. Assisted by W. P. Roberts, the miners' attorney-general, and Thomas Duncombe MP, in 1847 he arranged for the <span class="roman">Mines and Collieries Bill</span> to be introduced to parliament. Containing a comprehensive list of pitmen's demands, which every miner could endorse, although it was not passed by parliament, the bill represented an attempt to secure change through legislation, and had the effect of broadening miners' mental horizons, making them think of themselves on a national rather than local level. It also made them behave in a more respectable, moderate way, hopeful that it would influence parliament. Jude repeatedly stressed that better wages and shorter hours would also have beneficial knock-on effects, improving family life and providing an opportunity for educational pursuits.<br>
<br>Jude was aware of the coercive control of colliery owners, and argued that pitmen, fearful of losing their jobs, were often reluctant to raise safety matters. He therefore advocated the appointment of mines inspectors on a permanent basis, assisted by scientists where needed. Such an informed and independent body would, he argued, be able to express an impartial opinion on vital health and safety issues. The soundness of his argument was in time recognized.<br>
<br>Bringing pressure to bear on parliament was only part of Jude's strategy. He also sought to secure democratic rights for working people, which would give them the vote and allow them to elect their own representatives. In 1842 he was one of those nominated by Byker, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne, to the Chartist grand council, and in 1847 he was elected by Newcastle as delegate to the Chartist convention. In the 1850s he joined the short-lived Northern Political Union and then the much more influential Northern Reform Union, both of which strove to obtain political rights for working people.<br>
<br>The effects of the failure of the strike were long-lasting. Despite many attempts, Jude failed to restore union organization in the great northern coalfields to its pre-1844 strength. He was due to speak, along with W. P. Roberts, at a rally in 1858 which could be regarded as the beginning of the ultimately successful campaign, but was taken ill. Two years later, on 30 August 1860, Jude died in very abject circumstances at the Old Highlander public house in Liddell Street, North Shields, Northumberland. The ceremony marking his burial three days later at Elswick cemetery, Newcastle upon Tyne, was attended by only a few personal friends.<br>
<br>Revival of interest in Martin Jude came with the publication in 1873 of <span class="italic">The Miners of Northumberland and Durham</span>. Its author, Richard Fynes, knew Jude personally and refers to him as a moving spirit among the pitmen for nearly a quarter of a century. He ends his tribute: &#145;Of great and varied intelligence, his conduct was characterised by an entire lack of egotism. Firm yet conciliatory to opponents, his modest and respectful manner gained him many friends amongst those who differed with him in opinion.&#146;  (Fynes, 186).<br>
