<span class="headword">Gaitens,  Edward</span>  (1897&#150;1966), <span class="occ">short-story writer and novelist</span>, was born on 26 February 1897 at 104 South Wellington Street, in the Gorbals, Glasgow, probably fourth of six surviving children of Edward Gaitens, stationer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colwell. Gaitens was educated locally and left school at the age of fourteen, taking up a succession of unskilled jobs. During the First World War he spent two years in Wormwood Scrubs prison as a conscientious objector. He was homosexual and never married.<br>
<br>Gaitens began writing in his middle thirties. His first short story, &#145;Growing Up&#146;, was published in the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span> in 1938 on the recommendation of the playwright Osborne Henry Mavor (James Bridie), to whom he later dedicated his only novel. His first book, <span class="italic">Growing Up and Other Stories</span> (1942), was well reviewed. H. G. Wells wrote to the author, &#145;I do not exaggerate when I say that at least two of these stories are among the most beautiful in the English language&#146;  (Gaitens, <span class="italic">Dance of the Apprentices</span>). These ten lively, social&#150;realist pieces depict a sensitive boy observing and responding to his Glasgow background&#151;family, shipyard work, unemployment&#151;and discovering transcendental moments of beauty, as in &#145;The Sailing Ship&#146;. They appear to draw their inspiration from Gaitens's own experience. His long-term companion (and later literary executor) Charles Turner has been quoted as saying that &#145;he put his life into his writings&#146;  (Urquhart and Gordon, 203).<br>
<br>Gaitens lived in London during the Second World War and served for four years as a firewatcher. He returned to Glasgow after the war, working as a night telephonist. Encouraged by an Atlantic award in literature (1946) for <span class="italic">Growing Up</span>, he wrote <span class="italic">Dance of the Apprentices</span> (1948), the novel for which he is best-known today. It is episodic in structure, six stories from <span class="italic">Growing Up</span> appearing, with minor alterations, as chapters in the novel. Again the book seems to be semi-autobiographical, charting the adolescent experiences of Eddy Macdonnel and his friends, the apprentices of the title. Part 1 closes as they go gladly to prison as conscientious objectors at the outbreak of the First World War. Part 2 covers the next twenty years as they come to terms with the unsatisfactory &#145;world fit for heroes&#146; to which they have returned, but the last chapter is a strikingly detailed and bitter depiction of Eddy's&#151;or Gaitens's&#151;experiences in prison.<br>
<br>Gaitens published little else during his lifetime and his work was neglected for some years, perhaps owing to the restricted scope of his subject matter, perhaps to the ephemeral nature of his true medium, the short story. During the early 1960s, renting a basement flat in Edinburgh in poor health and considerable poverty, he sublet a room to the poet George Mackay Brown, who later wrote &#145;I think his gift had deserted him, but he kept still a bright eye and an eager spirit &hellip; He had long abandoned Catholicism, but men must be believing something and Edward's religion was art&#146;  (Brown, 159). Gaitens died of a heart attack in Deaconess Hospital, Edinburgh, on 16 December 1966.<br>
