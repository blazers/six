<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Casey,  Richard Gavin Gardiner</span>, Baron Casey  (1890&#150;1976), <span class="occ">politician in Australia and diplomatist</span>, was born on 29 August 1890 in George Street, Brisbane, Queensland, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Richard Gardiner Casey (1846&#150;1919), a pastoralist with mining interests, of Brisbane, and his wife, Evelyn Jane (1866&#150;1943), younger daughter of George Harris, merchant, of Brisbane. He was educated at Melbourne Church of England grammar school, Melbourne University, and Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated with a second class in mechanical sciences in 1913. Casey returned to Australia via the United States and had barely begun an engineering career when he joined the Australian Imperial Force in October 1914. He served in Egypt, Gallipoli, and France, rising to the rank of general staff officer. He was awarded the MC in 1917 and appointed to the DSO in the following year.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1919, Casey returned to Australia to assume his father's directorships. However, he craved travel and public service, and on 1 October 1924 the Australian prime minister, S. M. Bruce, appointed him Australia's first liaison officer attached to the cabinet secretariat in Whitehall. Casey's task was to keep Bruce <i>au courant</i> with day-to-day imperial problems, and occasionally to act for the Australian government in relations with the City and at the League of Nations in Geneva. While in London, Casey married Ethel Marian Sumner 
    (Maie; 1891&#150;1983)
  , writer and artist, and daughter of Major-General Sir Charles Snodgrass Ryan, surgeon, of Melbourne, on 24 June 1926. They were to have a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>In 1931 Casey joined the newly formed United Australia Party and entered the Australian federal parliament as member for Corio (Victoria). His rise was rapid, and he served as assistant treasurer from 1933 to 1935 and as treasurer from 1935 to 1939. His financial management was orthodox, though he had a social conscience which in 1938 led to Australia's first <span class="roman">National Health Insurance Bill</span>. Unfortunately R. G. Menzies chose the issue to split the cabinet in a challenge to the leadership of the prime minister, Joseph Lyons, and the bill was shelved. In April 1939 Lyons died, and Casey, Lyons's favourite for successor, chose to stand aside for Bruce. It was a bad miscalculation: Bruce reneged, Casey's rival Menzies assumed the mantle, and Casey lost the treasury.<br>
<br>Menzies appointed Casey minister for supply and development to organize the economy for the impending war. In October 1939 Casey visited London (where he was sworn a privy councillor) for supply talks and to help decide Australian military commitment to Europe. With Casey safely out of the country, Menzies won over the Country Party, who still had wanted Casey as prime minister. Consequently Casey resigned his seat to become Australia's first minister to the United States in March 1940. There he worked hard, usually in harness with the British ambassador, to bring the Americans into the war against Hitler and to secure a guarantee of aid against potential Japanese attacks on British possessions in the Pacific. Both objectives were achieved by late 1941.<br>
<br>Casey's work impressed Winston Churchill, who, in early 1942, appointed him British minister resident in the Middle East with a seat in the war cabinet. Among his most ticklish jobs was negotiating the replacing of Sir Claude Auchinleck as commander by Alexander and Montgomery in August 1942. After El Alamein, Casey concentrated upon civil administration. He employed characteristically simple and direct methods. Cabinet was persuaded to &#145;mop up&#146; inflation in the Middle East, including Iran, by buying up &pound;22&frac14; million of local currencies with gold between 1943 and 1945. Wheat shortages were solved by massive procurement campaigns. A Lebanese political crisis was averted when a Casey bluff induced the French to release the local cabinet from gaol.<br>
<br>So successful was Casey's trouble-shooting that, in early 1944, Churchill made him governor of Bengal to secure the base for the drive by Mountbatten against the Japanese in Burma. Here too his new broom was effective. He reorganized the embattled administration, inoculated virtually the whole population (54 of 65 million) against smallpox, and set about a gigantic food procurement programme to offset the likelihood of another famine of 1943 proportions, when over a million had died. Casey's methods impressed the government of India, which gave him an extra &pound;10 million subvention in his first year, but upset local politicians, and in his last year in Bengal he ruled by decree. In March 1946 he returned to Australia and in the next year became federal president of the Liberal Party.<br>
<br>Only in December 1949 did Casey manage to re-enter Australian politics and the ministry. From 1951 to 1960, as minister for external affairs, he encouraged closer relations with Asia and the United States via the Colombo plan and ANZUS and SEATO pacts. A notable achievement was the Antarctic treaty of 1959 which secured the continent for peaceful scientific research. In 1956 he privately opposed the use of force over Suez, an issue which helped lose him a ballot for the deputy leadership of the Liberal Party. He retired in 1960 and was created a life peer, as Baron Casey of Berwick and the City of Westminster. From 1965 to 1969 he was governor-general of Australia. In the latter year he was created KG, the first Australian to receive the honour. Always happiest as a lieutenant to the great, Casey had a pleasant, direct manner, innate decency, and a capacity for sustained work which made him one of Australia's and the Commonwealth's outstanding diplomatists and administrators. Nevertheless, he lacked the mental agility, political sense, and sheer ruthlessness necessary to achieve the Australian prime ministership, to which he long aspired. He died of pneumonia in St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, on 17 June 1976, and was buried on 22 June in Macedon cemetery.<br>
