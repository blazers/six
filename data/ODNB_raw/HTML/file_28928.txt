<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Webb,  Philip Barker</span>  (1793&#150;1854), <span class="occ">traveller and natural historian</span>, was born on 10 July 1793 at Milford House, near Godalming, Surrey, the eldest son in a family of three sons and three daughters of Captain Philip Smith Webb (1764&#150;1799) and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1853) daughter of Sir Robert Barker bt. He was a great-grandson of the lawyer and politician Philip Carteret Webb. He was educated firstly at a private boys' school, then at Harrow School and at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 17 October 1811. At Christ Church, William Buckland inspired him with a taste for geology. In 1812 he entered Lincoln's Inn and in 1815 he graduated as BA, but after the death of his father put him in command of a handsome fortune he at once began to satisfy his desire to travel, for which he had equipped himself by a study of Italian and Spanish while at Oxford.<br>
<br>Webb visited Vienna, where he made the acquaintance of the Italian Chevalier Alberto Parolini of Bassano (1788&#150;1867), who was of the same age, class, wealth, and tastes as himself, and had studied botany and geology under Giovanni Battista Brocchi (1772&#150;1826). Webb stayed with Parolini at Bassano, and Parolini returned his visit at Milford in 1817, when they planned a joint expedition to the East. In the meantime Webb paid a short visit to Sweden, visiting G&ouml;teborg, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and going as far as lat. 61&deg; N.<br>
<br>The winter of 1817&#150;18 Webb spent at Naples with his mother and two of his sisters. From Naples he and Parolini started their tour in April 1819 by way of Otranto, Corfu, Patras, and Athens, to the Cyclades, Constantinople, and the Troad (the plain of Troy), returning by Smyrna and Malta to Sicily. Webb, who was well versed in Homer and Strabo, carefully studied the topography of the Troad and came to conclusions very different from those propounded by Le Chevalier in his <span class="italic">Voyage de la Troade dans 1785 et 1789</span>. He published his views in 1821 as <span class="italic">Osservazioni intorno allo stato antico e presente dell'agro Trojano</span>, which was expanded in 1844 into <span class="italic">Topographie de la Troade ancienne et moderne</span>. This work showed much antiquarian and geological erudition. He rediscovered the River Scamander and Simois, and settled some other important points in Homeric geography.<br>
<br>In 1821 Webb returned to England and spent some time at Milford, managing his estate and collecting many interesting plants in his garden. In July 1825 he visited the entomologist L&eacute;on Dufour at St Sever, and after wintering in the south of France, made a year's tour of the eastern and southern coasts of Spain, collecting birds, fish, shells, and especially plants, a tour afterwards described in his <span class="italic">Iter Hispaniense</span> (1838) and <span class="italic">Otia Hispanica</span> (1839, enlarged ed. 1853). In April 1827 he went from Gibraltar to Tangier, and, though he found it impossible to get far into the interior, made a short exploration of Jebel Beni-Hosmar and Jebel Darsa, mountains near Tetuan, the flora of which was then entirely unknown. In June 1827 he left Gibraltar for Lisbon and devoted the remainder of the year to a journey on horseback through Portugal, the botanical results of which were included in his <span class="italic">Iter Hispaniense</span>, though his many geological and mineralogical notes, including a geological map of the Lisbon basin, made in conjunction with Louis da Silva Mouzinho d'Albuquerque, remain unpublished.<br>
<br>In May 1828 Webb left Lisbon for Madeira, where he spent some months botanizing, and in the following September went on to Tenerife, intending to proceed to Brazil. At Tenerife his Spanish assistant resigned and his place was taken by Sabin Berthelot (1794&#150;1880), a young Frenchman who had already spent eight years in the island and who had formed a herbarium. Webb remained nearly two years in the Canary Islands, visiting with him Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, and Palma. They studied and collected the plants, birds, fish, shells, and insects, examined the rocks, analysed the waters, made climatological observations, and neglected nothing which could help towards a complete natural history and geography of the archipelago. In August 1830 Webb and Berthelot embarked at Santa Cruz, and, being kept out of France by cholera and revolution, went by way of the coast of Algeria to Nice, and thence to Geneva and Montpellier. In June 1833 they established themselves in Paris, at a house on the Champs Elys&eacute;es, where Webb assembled a good library and a herbarium finer than any private collection in France save that of Delessert. In preparing their great work <span class="italic">Histoire naturelle des &icirc;les Canaries</span> (3 vols., 1836&#150;50, plus folio atlas), Webb reserved to himself most of the geology and botany and the description of the mammals, while Berthelot contributed the ethnography, the history of the conquest and of the relations of the islanders with the Moors and with America, and the geography. The services of A. Valenciennes were secured for the description of the fish; of Alcide d'Orbigny for the molluscs; of C. G. A. Brull&eacute;, P. H. Lucas, and P. J. M. Macquart for the insects; of F. L. P. Gervais for the reptiles; and of A. Moquin-Tandon for the birds. Articles were also contributed by J. D. Hooker, Alphonse de Candolle, Jacques Gay, Parlatore, and others. The atlas included 441 plates by the best artists obtainable.<br>
<br>After having spent fourteen years over the preparation of this work, travelling only between Milford and Paris, Webb wished to visit Tunis and Egypt to solve some botanical problems left unsettled by Vahl and Desfontaines, but was twice prevented by indifferent health and the news of unsatisfactory political and sanitary conditions of those countries. In January 1848 he travelled to Florence and Rome and devoted two years to collecting Italian plants. He had a pleasant time in Italy: at Rome he made the acquaintance of the Countess Elizabeth Mazzanti-Fiorini, the cryptogamist, the only woman, he said, whom he had ever met who loved botany passionately; and at Florence he was specially attracted by the botanical gallery of the museum, then under the care of his friend Parlatore, to which he planned to bequeath his library and herbaria. It was there that, in the winter of 1848&#150;9, he prepared his <span class="italic">Fragmenta florul&aelig; Aethiopico-Aegyptiac&aelig;</span>, which, however, was not published until 1854 owing to the Tuscan revolution of 1849.<br>
<br>After six weeks at Bagn&egrave;res-de-Luchon, where he had been ordered to take the waters, in the summer of 1850 Webb revisited Spain to put some finishing touches to <span class="italic">Otia Hispanica</span> and to visit his friend Gra&euml;lls, director of the museum and garden at Madrid. He had recently been given the order of Charles III by Queen Isabella, and on the occasion of this visit was elected corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences at Madrid.<br>
<br>In 1851 he returned to England, and in August, with his nephew, Godfrey Webb, visited Ireland, and, having received suggestions from his friend the botanist John Ball, explored the west coast from Cork to Killarney, Dingle, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Roundstone, and the Aranmore Islands, the home of an interesting offshoot of the Iberian flora which he so well knew. After a year devoted to a synopsis of the flora of the Canaries, which he did not live to finish, and a second futile attempt to start for Tunis in the autumn of 1852, Webb again visited Italy and his friend Parolini, but was recalled to England by the death of his mother in 1853. In May 1854 he started for Geneva to visit his younger brother, Admiral Webb, but at Paris was seized with gout; although he recovered sufficiently to be able to superintend on crutches the classification of his library by Moquin-Tandon, he died on 31 August 1854. He was buried in a mausoleum which he had built in the churchyard of Milford. The whole of his fine botanical library, collections, and herbarium, which by this time included the herbaria of Philippe Mercier, Desfontaines, La Billardi&egrave;re, Pavon, and Gustave de Montbret, together with complete sets of the plants collected by N. Wallich, R. Wight, G. Gardner, and Schimper, he bequeathed, with an endowment for their maintenance, to the Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany. Webb's executors lost a law suit to declare his will invalid, and the collections finally arrived in Florence in 1855, where they are housed at the Institute of Botany.<br>
<br>Webb was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 25 March 1824. He was also a fellow of the Linnean Society (1818), Society of Arts, and Geological Society. Besides the works already mentioned he was the author of seventeen papers, mainly on botany, published between 1833 and 1852. Nine of these appeared in the <span class="italic">Annales des Sciences Naturelles</span>. His most important paper was perhaps his &#145;Spicilegia Gorgonea&#146;, a determination of the plants of the Cape Verde Islands, prefixed to W. J. Hooker's <span class="italic">Niger Flora</span> (1849).<br>
