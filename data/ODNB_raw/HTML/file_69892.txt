<span class="headword">Goldwin <span class="st"> [Golding]</span>,  William</span>  (1496/7&#150;1562), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was admitted aged eighteen to King's College, Cambridge, as an Eton scholar, of Dorney near Windsor, on 16 August 1515. He took his BA early in 1520 and proceeded MA three years later, but from 1518 held a fellowship at King's until he returned to Eton College as headmaster for three years from 1525. By an error in the Eton audit books the master appears as John Goldwin, but no contemporary graduate of that name is known. Thus far, William's rise was rapid, but not as prodigious as that of Thomas Wolsey, who at twenty-four had become headmaster of Magdalen College School. In 1528 Wolsey brought Goldwin from Eton to be the first master of the college he was building at Ipswich, his birthplace, with a sister college at Oxford, to outdo Henry VI's and Wykeham's twin foundations. The Cardinal College of St Mary at Ipswich was to be more lavishly staffed than Eton or Winchester. To finance the new foundations Wolsey obtained the king's leave to suppress some dozen minor monastic establishments, mostly in Suffolk.<br>
<br>Goldwin served under William Capon, the college dean, from its opening in September 1528 until its closure after Wolsey's fall at Michaelmas 1530. Ominously the lavish celebrations on Lady day 1528 were completely ruined by atrocious weather. In January 1529 Goldwin, addressing Wolsey once as &#145;your Majesty&#146;, sent him a report in ornate Latin prose, enclosing specimens of the first pupils' writing and praising the worship provided by the dean in the chapel. The college had been using Wolsey's <span class="italic">Rudimenta grammatices et docendi methodus</span> which he had prescribed, according to its title-page, &#145;not only for Ipswich, but for all the other schools in England&#146;. Goldwin wrote of &#145;so plentiful a crop springing up that he did not despair of the harvest&#146;. The pupils were &#145;all of good intelligence and the flock increased hourly, so that the house was too small to hold them properly&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 5159). When the blow fell the local boys were cast forth, since they and their grammar school's endowments had been swallowed up by the college. Thomas Cromwell, however, persuaded the king to refound the town school and Goldwin stayed on as master, moving back to a fellowship at Eton in 1539. He held several college livings&#151;Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, in 1544&#150;6, Stogursey, Somerset, in 1554&#150;6, and the rectory of Piddlehinton, Dorset&#151;from vacating his fellowship in 1550 until his death on 15 May 1562. It is ironic that his modest locally engraved inscription brass at Piddlehinton is a piece of monastic spoil; palimpsest, its reverse shows the lower half of the figure of a prior with his staff.<br>
