<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharp,  Clifford Dyce</span>  (1883&#150;1935), <span class="occ">journalist and journal editor</span>, was born on 21 October 1883 at White Post House, Redhill, Surrey, the son of William Sharp, a solicitor, and his wife, Harriot Luisa Dyce. He had a stern nonconformist upbringing, and after attending St Lawrence College at Ramsgate submitted to his parents' wishes that he study engineering at University College, London, and then join his father's practice after graduation. As an articled attorney he found the law as tedious as applied science, and looked to Fleet Street for his eventual career. Not only could he write quickly and to order, but his legal training and engineering background had left him uniquely skilled to embrace the technical side of editing. A. R. Orage of <span class="italic">New Age</span> introduced the tiro editor to the finer points of newspaper composition and production. With his innovative ideas in layout and typography Sharp soon pioneered a fresh approach to weekly journalism.<br>
<br>Sharp was employed by Sidney and Beatrice Webb to help run the National Committee for the Prevention of Destitution (NCPD), their singularly unsuccessful attempt to promote the minority report of the poor law commission. Between 1910 and 1913 he transformed the NCPD's <span class="italic">Crusade</span> from a rather amateurish 12-page campaign newsletter into a polished if ponderous 35-page monthly magazine. The Fabian technician <i>par excellence</i>, the dour but ambitious Sharp had since joining the Society in 1900 assiduously cultivated the &#145;old gang&#146; of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47683/', "Hubert Bland")</script>, George Bernard Shaw, and the Webbs. When in 1906 younger members established a &#145;Fabian nursery&#146; he was duly elected treasurer; the secretary was Bland's (and his wife <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31919/', "Edith Nesbit's")</script>) daughter, Rosamund Edith Nesbit Bland (<i>b</i>. 1886/7). Paternal intervention and the threat of a public scandal ended her romance with H. G. Wells, and on 16 October 1909 a heartbroken Rosamund reluctantly married Sharp. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>Despite his debt to Orage, Sharp in April 1913 had the guild socialist <span class="italic">New Age</span> firmly in his sights when launching the Webbs' last great propagandist initiative, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, which embodied an unashamedly top-down Fabian collectivism. As its first editor, he swiftly established the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> as a weekly flagship of progressive opinion and an influential literary review, with a metropolitan influence which far exceeded its modest circulation. He relied heavily on the reputation of George Bernard Shaw, even though the relationship between the two men was stormy. The editor's increasing reluctance to tolerate his principal contributor's idiosyncrasies and eccentric opinions culminated in Shaw's resigning from the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> board in October 1916. Sharp tolerated Shaw, but genuinely loathed David Lloyd George. The prime minister reciprocated by orchestrating Sharp's conscription into the Royal Artillery early in 1917.<br>
<br>Ironically, Sharp was infuriated when the Foreign Office soon secured the trainee subaltern's release. Posing as a freelance journalist, Sharp canvassed opinion among social democrats at the Stockholm conference. He became head of the British embassy's information service in Sweden, and late in 1918 commenced clandestine work for the Foreign Office's political information department as the author of fiercely anti-Bolshevik reports. Yet, when the articles finally appeared in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, following Sharp's return to London in March 1919, they unequivocally condemned counter-revolutionary excesses in Finland and northern Russia.<br>
<br>Sharp quickly discovered that the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> had moved decisively to the left during his absence. He endeavoured in vain to bring his creation within the orbit of Asquith's circle, with whom he desperately sought to ingratiate himself. Rejecting the opportunity to edit one of London's evening newspapers, the Liberal <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, Sharp battled with the bottle and with his board. His erstwhile colleagues were convinced that politically and commercially the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>'s best course was to remain an independent and if necessary deeply critical supporter of a Labour Party which in the 1920s was making significant electoral gains at the expense of the Liberals. In 1924 Sharp survived dismissal and reinstatement, but his alcoholism became so chronic that five years later the directors funded a lengthy visit for him to New York in order to dry out. After his return in 1930 the unrepentant inebriate was duly dismissed. The <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> had suffered deep wounds as a consequence of prolonged inertia and the absence of a clear editorial policy. Yet Sharp's creation was resilient enough in 1931 to absorb the moribund Liberal weekly <span class="italic">Nation</span>, and then embark upon a golden age of high sales and high politics under Kingsley Martin as editor.<br>
<br>Sharp never wholly adjusted to his new circumstances, and his drinking prevented him from successfully completing any subsequent commissions. He was forced to live off his wife, despite their brief separation in the winter of 1932&#150;3. In the final year of his life Sharp desperately tried to stop drinking, but on 11 February 1935 he died of a heart attack at Farnborough Hospital, Farnborough, Kent. Although Beatrice Webb was quick to acknowledge her prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s accomplishments as an editor, Clifford Sharp soon became the forgotten man of Fleet Street, his reputation as the chief architect of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> eclipsed by the high profile of his successor.<br>
