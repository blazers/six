<span class="headword">Lawrence,  Harry Lawrence  Bradfer-</span>  (1887&#150;1965), <span class="occ">antiquary and collector of manuscripts</span>, was born on 1 April 1887 at 8 Paynes Court, Church Street, King's Lynn, the son of Charles Bradfer (<i>d</i>. 1886/7), a draper's assistant, and his wife, Elizabeth Lawrence. He was educated initially at home because of poor health, and then at secondary school in King's Lynn. He married Violet Evelyn, daughter of William Charles Bradfield, a draper, on 23 July 1913. They had a daughter, Bridget Evelyn (<i>d</i>. 1997) and a son, Philip Leslie (who shared his father's love of book collecting and became a member of the Roxburghe Club in his own right). Bradfer-Lawrence became a land agent and worked in Norfolk until 1935 when he was appointed managing director of Hammond's brewery in Yorkshire, a firm which greatly expanded under his administration. When it merged in 1960 to become United Breweries he became the first chairman.<br>
<br>Bradfer-Lawrence was an enthusiastic antiquary. He made occasional contributions to the <span class="italic">Antiquaries Journal</span> and was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1924; he exhibited items from his collections for the society. He became its treasurer in 1944 and did much to set the society's affairs in order. He gave collections of manuscript materials to the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society.<br>
<br>Bradfer-Lawrence published a number of volumes chiefly connected with the history and archaeology of Norfolk. He edited <span class="italic">The account of Edmund Carvell and Humfrey Bedyngfelde as the executors of the will of Thomas Karvell of Wiggenhall</span> (1916) for the Norfolk Record Society, and <span class="italic">The Muster Returns for Divers Hundreds in the County of Norfolk</span> (1935) for the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society. In addition he wrote <span class="italic">The Merchants of Lynn</span> (1927) and a history of Castle Rising (1929). He was also a distinguished book collector, particularly of medieval manuscripts, of which he owned nearly sixty. After his death his collection of manuscripts was deposited for a number of years in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, before being sold to Quaritch, who dispersed them by private sale and auction. He also collected printed books from the fifteenth to the twentieth centuries, many of which were sold at Sothebys after his death. In addition, he had a substantial collection of manuscripts and printed books relating to Richard Jefferies. His achievements as a book collector were acknowledged by his election to the Roxburghe Club in 1954.<br>
<br>Bradfer-Lawrence died on 19 October 1965 at Ashby Hall, Ashby St Mary, Norwich.<br>
