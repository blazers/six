<span class="headword">Smith,  (Emily) Sheila  Kaye-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>(Emily) Sheila Fry]</span>  (1887&#150;1956), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 4 February 1887 at Battle Lodge, 9 Dane Road, St Leonards, Sussex, the elder daughter of Edward Kaye-Smith (1840&#150;1922), general medical practitioner, and his wife, Emily Janet Maclean (1843&#150;1924), daughter of Robert de la Condamine and his wife, Janet. Sheila Kaye-Smith (she never used her first name) grew up in east Sussex, and childhood memories of summers spent with her younger sister, Selina (1889&#150;1924), on local farms were to provide a fertile source of images for her novels set in the region. Photographic portraits of Sheila Kaye-Smith by E. O. Hopp&eacute; and Howard Coster reveal a serious yet unassuming woman, her dark hair cut in a short twenties bob. She attended St Leonards Ladies' College and in her teenage years wrote six short novels a year. When she was twenty-one her first full-length novel, <span class="italic">The Tramping Methodist</span> (1908), was published. It displays themes which were to become characteristic of her work: love of place&#151;specifically the Kent and Sussex borders&#151;and a fascination with the Christian faith. During a career spanning some fifty years, she had thirty-one novels published with many more remaining in manuscript. Among her best-known works are <span class="italic">Tamarisk Town</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Joanna Godden</span> (1922), <span class="italic">The End of the House of Alard</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">The History of Susan Spray, the Female Preacher</span> (1931). In 1947 <span class="italic">Joanna Godden</span> was made into a film with Googie Withers in the title role.<br>
<br>As a regional novelist, Sheila Kaye-Smith has much to offer: topographical accuracy, a keen ear for dialect, and a genuine affection for the locale and its people. She knew a great deal about farming life and the harsh conditions of farm workers in the nineteenth century and described their lot with imaginative sympathy. Indeed her evocation of rural life, as in <span class="italic">Sussex Gorse</span> (1916), is realistic and vivid. However, although her characters are on the whole believable, there is a lack of psychological subtlety throughout. Though popular in their day, regrettably her novels have not found lasting acclaim, although <span class="italic">Joanna Godden</span> and <span class="italic">Susan Spray</span> were reprinted by Virago in 1983. Her most successful novel was <span class="italic">The End of the House of Alard</span>, which was a best-seller in both Britain and America. The theme of Anglo-Catholicism is central to this work as it was in the author's own life, and the declining fortunes of the novel's house of Alard come to symbolize the more general decline of the ruling classes in England following the First World War. Through the character of Gervase Alard, who eventually enters a monastery, Sheila Kaye-Smith expresses her own growing belief in Catholicism as the locus of immutable order and tradition.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1924 Kaye-Smith married the Revd Theodore Penrose Fry (1892&#150;1971), eldest son of Sir John Fry, baronet. They had met at the Anglo-Catholic Christ Church in St Leonards, where he was the curate. It was a church she had secretly visited as a child, attracted by the flickering candles and the smell of incense, visits disapproved of by her Anglican parents. Unable to remain at Christ Church once he was married, Penrose Fry accepted a curacy at St Stephen's, Gloucester Road, London, where a few years later T. S. Eliot became churchwarden. The couple lived first in North and then South Kensington. During this time she wrote a non-fictional study, <span class="italic">Anglo-Catholicism</span> (1925). In 1929 they returned to Sussex, both deeply dissatisfied with Anglicanism, and were received into the Roman Catholic church. They bought Little Doucegrove, near Northiam in Sussex, a dilapidated oasthouse&#151;which had featured in her early novel <span class="italic">Spell Land</span> (1910)&#151;together with 50 acres of farmland. This was to be their home for the rest of their lives. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In addition to her novels, Sheila Kaye-Smith wrote some poetry, an autobiography entitled <span class="italic">Three Ways Home</span> (1937), and a few works of non-fiction including two books on Jane Austen with G. B. Stern, <span class="italic">Talking of Jane Austen</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">More about Jane Austen</span> (1949). Her guide <span class="italic">The Weald of Kent and Sussex</span> (1953) was part of the <span class="roman">Regional Books</span> series and still provides a useful introduction to the region. Sheila Kaye-Smith died suddenly of a heart attack on 14 January 1956 at Little Doucegrove. She is buried beside her husband in the grounds of a small Catholic church which she had built at Little Doucegrove and which was dedicated to St Theresa of Lisieux, about whom she had written in <span class="italic">Quartet in Heaven</span> (1952).<br>
