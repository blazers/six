<span class="headword">Parker <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kerr-Fisher; <em>other married name </em>Chichester]</span>, Dame  Dehra</span>  (1882&#150;1963), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 August 1882 in the military hospital at Dehra Dun, north of Delhi, India, the only child of James Kerr-Fisher (1827&#150;1891) of Kilrea, co. Londonderry, and Annie Kerr-Forsythe. Educated in the United States, where her father had extensive property holdings, and Germany, she was twice married: first, on 11 December 1901, to Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Peel Dawson Spencer Chichester, a Unionist MP, who died in 1921, with whom she had a son and daughter. On 4 June 1928 she married Henry Wise Parker (1875&#150;1940). Before entering parliament her first husband, a native of co. Londonderry, served with the Central African Rifles 1897&#150;9 and in South Africa in 1899 and 1900. He commanded the 6th battalion (the duke of Cambridge's own) Middlesex regiment from 1904 to 1913, in which capacity he commanded combined escorts to the Anglo-German boundary commission, Nyasa, and Tanganyika in 1908. Latterly, he commanded the 14th service battalion, Royal Irish Rifles, and served as a captain in the Irish Guards. Her second husband, Parker (CB 1916, CMG 1924), spent his career in the Royal Navy, becoming an admiral in 1933. In 1916 he commanded HMS <i>Benbow</i> at the battle of Jutland Bank. Shortly after their marriage he was rear-admiral commanding 1st cruiser squadron, Mediterranean Fleet (1928&#150;30). He retired the list in 1934.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Dehra Parker was a staunch and unapologetic unionist. This stance was signalled early in her political career by her involvement in the formation of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council in 1911, and in 1912 when she acted as an organizer of the nursing units for the Ulster Volunteer Force created by Sir Edward Carson to resist the introduction of home rule. During the First World War she worked under the aegis of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, for which services she was to become an OBE in 1918. In 1949 she was created DBE and in 1957 GBE.<br>
<br>Chichester was one of only two women to be elected to the first Northern Ireland parliament in 1921, and in 1924 moved the loyal address to the king's speech, the first woman to do so in the empire. She remained in parliament as the Ulster Unionist member for Londonderry until 1929, when she resigned her seat shortly after her second marriage. In 1933 she returned to the Northern Ireland parliament as Ulster Unionist member for South Londonderry, a seat she held continuously until her retirement in 1960, when she was succeeded by her grandson, Major James Chichester-Clark (Lord Moyola), who was to serve as Northern Ireland's penultimate prime minister between 1969 and 1971. Her loyalty to Ulster and to successive administrations in Northern Ireland was unflinching. Never to vote against any Unionist government throughout her parliamentary career, she found some reward when in 1937 she was appointed to the junior ministerial post of parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Education. In 1944 she resigned from the post for &#145;personal reasons&#146;  (Northern Ireland parliament, <span class="italic">Official Report and Debates</span>, vol. 27, col. 321, 29 Feb 1944), although her relationship with the minister for education, Professor William Corkey&#151;who was himself sacked for neglecting his duties&#151;had been acrimonious, a fact widely acknowledged in parliamentary circles. Passed over as Corkey's successor, she returned to the back benches until 1949, when she was appointed minister for health and local government by the Northern Ireland prime minister, Sir Basil Brooke. Her appointment represented a triple achievement: not only was she one of the first women elected to the Northern Ireland parliament, but she was the first to hold a junior ministerial post in the province, and she was also the only woman appointed to the Northern Ireland cabinet and thus its sole female privy councillor.<br>
<br>During her tenure as minister Parker oversaw the implementation of the National Health Service in Northern Ireland and piloted a number of housing bills through parliament, including one that decontrolled rents in the private rented sector and as such was at variance with housing legislation in Great Britain. The bill, which she described in characteristically egotistical terms as &#145;a monument to me&#146;  (Paisley, 80), aroused enormous controversy, occasioning the resignation of the attorney-general, Edmund Warnock, who considered it &#145;unjust&#146;  (Northern Ireland parliament, <span class="italic">Official Report and Debates</span>, vol. 35, col. 733, 18 April 1956). Parker was forced to concede a number of critical amendments and, following a stroke, stood down as minister in 1957 and returned to the back benches until her retirement from parliament in 1960.<br>
<br>In parliament Parker was a controversial figure, seldom missing an opportunity to chide Irish nationalists and her particular <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>, independent unionists, for &#145;disloyalty&#146; to Ulster, and fundamentalist protestants, for whom she had a withering disregard. As a minister she was described by one of her senior officials as &#145;capricious, an adroit politician and a most formidable operator&#146;  (Oliver, 224) and acquired a reputation as a &#145;kingmaker&#146; in Unionist political circles  (Paisley). Beyond parliament Parker was a long-serving local councillor on Magherafelt rural district council, president of both the Northern Ireland Physical Training Association and the Girls' Training Corps, chairman of the ancient monuments advisory committee, and chairman and later president of the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts in the province. She died at her home, Shanemullagh House, Castledawson, co. Londonderry, on 28 November 1963 and was buried two days later in the grounds of Christ Church, Castledawson.<br>
