<span class="headword">Keiller,  John Mitchell</span>  (1851&#150;1899), <span class="occ">preserves and confectionery manufacturer</span>, was born at 3 Nelson Street, Dundee, on new year's day 1851, the only child of Alexander Keiller (1821&#150;1877), a preserves and confectionery manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Mitchell (1813&#150;1871). He came from a long line of Keillors, Kelers, and Killers, resident in the town for centuries, mainly in modest mercantile capacities. His formal education started at the proprietary school in Dundee, and continued, with considerable success, in the Greek-revival surroundings of the Dundee high school. At Edinburgh University he won prizes, but left before graduation to pursue&#151;as a prelude to commercial work&#151;two years of language studies in France and Germany. At the age of twenty he was back home, in the family firm. Six years later, in 1877, his father died, and he became the youthful and third-generation inheritor of the largest and most successful business of its kind in Britain. In 1883 he married Mary (1862&#150;1907), the daughter of David Grieg MD, of Dundee: a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55071/', "Alexander Keiller")</script>, was born in 1889.<br>
<br>The confectionery firm was set up around 1800 by John's grandfather James Keiller (1775&#150;1839) in Seagate, near a sugar refinery and the busy waters of the Tay. As a young unmarried grocer, he worked in close association with his enterprising mother, Janet Mathewson. Business was initially local, but rapidly expanded as a result of harbour and transport improvements, a population explosion in and around Dundee, and the coastal probings of the London retail and entrep&ocirc;t markets. James Keiller's special offering was chip (shredded-peel) marmalade, a supposedly warming breakfast spread, in place of the beaten (pulped-peel) marmalade of English desserts. After his death his widow, Margaret Spence (1800&#150;1850), took over the business, maintaining its by then famously high standards. She was followed, after her own death, by three sons: Alexander (1821&#150;1877), William (1829&#150;1899), and Wedderspoon (1835&#150;1866). Wedderspoon and William successively ran new factories in Guernsey, set up in 1857 to bypass sugar duties, which left Alexander as sole manager of the Dundee firm, by that time called James Keiller &amp; Son. By the mid-1870s it was lodged in spacious buildings off Albert Square.<br>
<br>When John Keiller took control in 1877, output ranged from marmalade, jellies, and jams, through lozenges, comfits, and jujubes, to candied peels and bottled fruits. He greatly expanded the enterprise, with a &#145;characteristic pushfulness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span>, 6 Jan 1899), but refrained from radical innovation. Items on the firm's 1887 price list were identical to those of twenty years earlier&#151;chocolate and cocoa products being added only in the 1890s. Keiller did, however, travel the world, &#145;ever on the alert to widen the industry by opening up new markets&#146;  (ibid.). Exhibition medals from Vienna (1873) and Cape Town (1877) were supplemented by new marmalade awards from Sydney (1879), Melbourne (1881), and Calcutta (1884). Of importance, too, was Keiller's transfer in 1879 of English production (following the repeal of sugar duty) from Guernsey to Silvertown, London. His junior co-partner, James Boyd, assisted, becoming manager of the new, markedly self-sufficient, factory on the Thames&#151;&#145;mammoth works &hellip; declared a study of marvellous perfection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dundee Courier &amp; Argus</span>, 6 Jan 1899). In 1893 the decision was taken to make James Keiller &amp; Son a limited-liability company. John Keiller became chairman, though he used the juncture to begin a progressive withdrawal from direct business activity.<br>
<br>Unlike his modest predecessors, Keiller seemed happy to divert profits into conspicuous personal expenditure and to break out of the limits imposed by his ancestral town. Outlays included the purchase of Binrock House, Dundee, about 1880, and (on the sale of Binrock) 9 Cavendish Square and 13 Hyde Park Gardens, London; the 10,000 acre Morven and Gairnside shooting estate (with the later Craigendarroch Lodge) on Deeside in 1886; the ocean-going yacht <i>Erl King</i>; and, for the 1887 jubilee, the donation of more than 3000 books to the Dundee Free Library and the clearance of the Albert Institute's &pound;9500 debt (opening the way for the Victoria Galleries extension to Sir George Gilbert Scott's original building). These last gestures, combined with other gifts, a lively patronage of the fine arts, some limited public service, and a local magistracy, secured his good name in Dundee&#151;despite the place having latterly &#145;seen or heard very little of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span>, 6 Jan 1899).<br>
<br>In politics, Keiller was conservative; in religion, Church of Scotland. He suffered poor health in his last years, and died on his yacht, in tempestuous seas between Madeira and the West Indies, on 2 January 1899, aged only forty-eight. He was buried in the western cemetery, Dundee. An annuity was bequeathed to his widow, Mary, and a &pound;20,000 pension fund was set up for his workforce. The bulk of his estate passed, in trust, to his son.<br>
