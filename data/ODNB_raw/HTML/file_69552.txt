<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Massey,  Daniel Raymond</span>  (1933&#150;1998), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 10 October 1933 at 21 Wilton Crescent, Westminster, the only son and elder child of the Canadian actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61910/', "Raymond Hart Massey (1896&#150;1983)")</script> and his actress wife, Gladys Allen (1907&#150;1993), who acted under the name Adrianne Allen. His younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103953/', "Anna Massey (1937&#150;2011)")</script>, was also an actress. Given that his godfather was No&euml;l Coward, everything conspired to lead Massey too towards a life in the theatre, and after Eton College and two years in the Scots Guards, he went up to King's College, Cambridge, and made his stage d&eacute;but in the 1956 Footlights revue, <span class="italic">Anything May</span>, whose writers included Michael Frayn and Bamber Gascoigne.<br>
<br>Tall, lean, aristocratic, and blessed with a resonant musical voice, Massey was untypical of the new school of regional working-class actors emerging in the late 1950s. But his debonair charm and transatlantic inheritance&#151;his father became a naturalized American in 1944&#151;quickly enabled him to find work in both London and New York. He made his d&eacute;but in both theatrical capitals in 1957, scoring a particular success as a gauche young American in a frothy West End comedy, <span class="italic">The Happiest Millionaire</span>. But it was his performance as a Portobello Road Wedgwood dealer in a musical by Monty Norman and David Henneker, <span class="italic">Make me an Offer</span>, at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, in 1959 that marked him out as an actor of exceptional grace and style.<br>
<br>For much of the next decade Massey moved easily between classics, musicals, and comedies. He took up semi-permanent residence at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, appearing as Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1962), Jack Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1966), and John Worthing in <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span> (1968). But he also commuted to Broadway to play opposite Barbara Cook in a delightful American musical, <span class="italic">She Loves Me</span>, in 1963, and starred as the adoring husband in the West End version of Neil Simon's <span class="italic">Barefoot in the Park</span> in 1965. He gave his most distinctive screen performance playing his own godfather in the ill-fated 1968 film about Gertrude Lawrence, <span class="italic">Star!</span> Coward confided to his diaries: &#145;Daniel Massey was excellent as me &hellip; he was tactless enough to sing better than I do, but of <i>course</i> without my special matchless charm!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coward Diaries</span>, 667).<br>
<br>As if to prove that he was more than a graceful stylist, Massey deliberately widened his range over the next decade. In 1974 he memorably played Lytton Strachey, with gently fluting voice and lily-white hands suspended from his arms as if on wires, in Peter Luke's <span class="italic">Bloomsbury</span> at the Phoenix Theatre. He went on to appear, less convincingly, as Othello at Nottingham Playhouse, but was a fine guilt-racked John Rosmer in a 1977 West End revival of Ibsen's <span class="italic">Rosmersholm</span>. But it was through his work with the national companies that Massey both stretched his talent and showed himself to be a first-rate classical actor. He had a particular affinity with Shaw and appeared, to great effect, at the National Theatre in <span class="italic">The Philanderer</span> (1979), as John Tanner in <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span> (1981), and, in 1994, as General Burgoyne in <span class="italic">The Devil's Disciple</span>: this last was a perfect study of a man who adopts a pose of ironic languor to disguise his moral outrage at the loss of the American colonies.<br>
<br>Massey also enjoyed a rich spell with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1980s. Both as the Duke in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> and as the politician&#150;hero of Harley Granville-Barker's <span class="italic">Waste</span> he suggested the pathos of the public idealist slowly awakening to the emptiness of his private life. But he was also at home in new plays. In 1979 he created the role of Robert, the deceived and deceiving husband, in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">Betrayal</span> at the National Theatre. In 1984 he played Nikolai, a wealthy Russian aristocrat and thwarted pioneer of talking pictures, in Stephen Poliakoff's <span class="italic">Breaking the Silence</span> for the Royal Shakespeare Company. He also played the tortured hero, Ben, in the 1987 London premi&egrave;re of Stephen Sondheim's musical <span class="italic">Follies</span>.<br>
<br>Massey's own life had its share of anguish. His parents divorced when he was six, and he later became bitterly estranged from his mother, whom he at one point compared to the Moors murderer Myra Hindley. He also married three times. His first marriage, on 30 September 1961, was to the actress Adrienne Corri, daughter of Louis Reccoboni, hotelier; the marriage ended in divorce in 1968. Massey had a son, Paul, by another relationship before marrying, on 12 December 1975, his co-star in <span class="italic">Betrayal</span>, Penelope Alice Wilton, daughter of Clifford William Wilton, company director. They had a daughter, Alice. The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Massey's third marriage, on 21 June 1997, was to Penelope's younger sister, Linda Mary (Lindy) Wilton. In 1992 he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, which for a time he successfully fought off with chemotherapy. Although the illness affected his career and gave his aquiline features a ravaged look, he gave one last magnificent stage performance in 1995, in both London and New York, as Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler in Ronald Harwood's <span class="italic">Taking Sides</span>. Classical music was one of Massey's private passions, and he made his audience understand both the conductor's belief in the transformative power of music and his residual guilt over his complicity with Nazi tyranny. It was both a magisterial performance and a reminder that Massey, having started out as an aristocratic charmer, later revealed a positive genius for playing damaged idealists. He died on 25 March 1998 at the Brompton Hospital, Chelsea, London, and was survived by his third wife, Lindy, his son Paul, and his daughter Alice. A memorial service was held on 16 June 1998 at St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
