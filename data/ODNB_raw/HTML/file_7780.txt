<span class="headword">Dolben, Sir  William</span>, third baronet  (1727&#150;1814), <span class="occ">politician and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born and baptized on 12 January 1727 at Finedon, Northamptonshire, the second and only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7777/', "Sir John Dolben, second baronet (1684&#150;1756)")</script>, rector of Burton Latimer and vicar of Finedon, and his wife, Elizabeth Digby (<i>d</i>. 1730). He was educated at Westminster School and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 May 1744, aged seventeen; he was elected a student of the house in 1744 and awarded the degree of DCL on 7 July 1763. Soon after coming down from Oxford he married, at Westminster Abbey on 17 May 1748, Judith (1730&#150;1771), the only daughter of Somerset English of Eastergate, Sussex, housekeeper of Hampton Court Palace, and his wife, Judith, the daughter and eventual heir of Hugh Pearson of Hampnett, Sussex. She brought with her a fortune of &pound;30,000. Dolben succeeded his father in the baronetcy on 20 November 1756 and served as high sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1760&#150;61. He was appointed a verderer of Rockingham Forest in 1766.<br>
<br>Dolben's family background, his personal reputation for probity, and his attachment to a moderate toryism made him a stop-gap candidate to represent the University of Oxford in the Commons at the by-election of 3 February 1768. He had already been nominated as one of the county MPs for Northamptonshire, so when he lost his seat following the dissolution later in 1768 he was returned to the Commons for Northamptonshire. A supporter of the duke of Grafton and Lord North, he stood down in 1774 and was readopted by the university on the retirement of Sir Roger Newdigate at the general election of 1780. Dolben told his predecessor that he meant to act his &#145;humble part, on so great a Theatre &hellip; free from all attachments&#146; apart from those of the university and the country  (Dolben to Newdigate, 24 Sept 1780, Warks. CRO, Newdigate Papers, CR136/B1636), and his record bears scrutiny. He sat in the Commons as an independent for the next twenty-six years, supporting the governments of North, Pitt, and Addington, though none of them uncritically, and was a terse, unacerbic speaker respected throughout the house. He voted for parliamentary reform in 1783, 1785, and 1797. Seeing himself as a lay watchdog of the Church of England in the Commons, he criticized J. P. Bastard's 1787 bill to regulate the church courts, which forbade prosecutions for immorality after the lapse of six months. Dolben was also ready to defend clergy rights to resist unacceptable forms of tithe commutation in private bills. Moral issues always attracted him, and he was a strong supporter of the royal proclamation against vice and immorality issued in 1787; in 1795 he initially backed a bill for the more effectual working of the <span class="roman">Lord's Day Observance Act</span> that would have made a breach of the sabbath a breach of the peace. No cause was dearer to him than the abolition of slavery, or at least the improvement of conditions for black slaves being shipped to the West Indies on the middle passage. Despite opposition from the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool, with Pitt's support he successfully piloted a bill through the Commons in 1788 designed to limit the number of slaves allowed on a vessel in proportion to its tonnage (initially, for a trial period of a year). Dolben developed a close alliance in parliament with William Wilberforce on the slave trade. He supported in principle the series of abolition bills Wilberforce brought forward in the 1790s (often acting as chairman at the committee stage), while his own annual bill to extend <span class="roman">Dolben's Act</span> of 1788 gave him the chance to expatiate regularly on the trade's iniquities. Influenced by Wilberforce, Dolben supported his motion for peace with France on 27 May 1795.<br>
<br>Dolben had a happy and relaxed family life. Following the death of his first wife, aged forty, on 6 January 1771, he married a second cousin, Charlotte Scotchmer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Affleck (<i>c</i>.1739&#150;1820), on 14 October 1789. She was the widow of John Scotchmer (<i>d</i>. 1786), a banker, of Pakenham, Suffolk, and the sixth daughter of Gilbert Affleck, of Dalham Hall, Suffolk, and his wife, Ann, the daughter of John Dolben, brother of the first baronet. Dolben was delighted with his new wife. He thus described her prior to their wedding:<blockquote>Her mien is erect and Generous; Her stature rather full, her shape in fine proportion slender, and her limbs grow from it with such happy elegance as gives peculiar grace to all her motions &hellip; she is a woman of real and intrinsic fashion. (Dolben to James Bland Burges, 18 Sept 1789, Bodl. Oxf., DD Bland Burges)</blockquote>They had no children. Though troubled by increasing deafness, Dolben enjoyed a vigorous old age, and never wore a greatcoat or had a fire in his bedroom. As his son reported in July 1803: &#145;My venerable Father, tho' 76 met the Parishioners at Church Porch and vowed he would go Volunteer in the Army at reserve against French invasion, if they would not, praising God he was able&#146;  (pocket diary of Sir John English Dolben, Northants. RO, Dolben (Finedon) collection, D(F) 65). He made his last public appearance at the Northamptonshire county meeting in 1807 to thank the king for his stand against Catholic emancipation. Dolben died at Bury St Edmunds on 20 March 1814, aged eighty-seven, and was buried on 27 March at Finedon church. He was succeeded in the title and estates by (John) English Dolben (1750&#150;1837), his only surviving son from his first marriage. His widow died on 12 March 1820.<br>
<br>Dolben was a country gentleman whose dedication to the Church of England, Oxford University, and the county of Northamptonshire came naturally to him. He consistently gave generously of his time and money to encourage worthy causes, such as the Sunday school movement. He was also a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce and of the Marine Society, and he was a Radcliffe trustee at Oxford. It was typical of Dolben that one of his first actions after inheriting was (in 1757) to make over the great tithes of Finedon to the vicar, appreciably increasing the latter's income. But it is his single-minded dedication to the abolitionist cause for which he merits recognition. The African author of <span class="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery</span> (1787), Ottobah Cugoano, predicted that in time &#145;your noble name shall be revered from shore to shore&#146;  (Northants. RO, Dolben (Finedon) collection, D(F) 39, n.d., probably 1788), and though posterity has been more forgetful, Dolben's life as an enlightened lay Anglican impressed all his contemporaries. He closely resembled Richardson's fictional hero Sir Charles Grandison and remained free of any trace of priggishness to the last, &#145;the model of a man, a gentleman, and a Christian&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 84/1, 1814, 526). As some of his sorrowing constituents put it: &#145;No man bore human sorrows with greater firmness nor felt a more lively compassion for those of other men &hellip; In him courtesy was but the ornament of sincerity, never its substitute&#146;  (draft letter, 16 April 1814, Northants. RO, Dolben (Finedon) collection, D(F) 52).<br>
