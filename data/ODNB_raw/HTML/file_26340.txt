<span class="headword">Stedman,  John Gabriel</span>  (1744&#150;1797), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born on 4 April 1744 in Dendermonde, the Netherlands, the eldest of the five children of Robert Stedman (1701&#150;1770), a Scot and a lieutenant-colonel in the Scots brigade, a mercenary unit, and his wife, Antoinetta Christina (1710&#150;1788), the daughter of Nicholas van Ceulen and his wife, Johanna de Heron Reygersman, of Bergen op Zoom. After early years spent following his father's regiment from one Dutch fort to another he was sent to Dunfermline, Fife, in 1755 to be tutored by his stern uncle, John Stedman MD (1710&#150;1791), the author of <span class="italic">Laelius and Hortensia</span> (1782), and had an unhappy two years there. Our knowledge of the first twenty-eight years of Stedman's life stems largely from the retrospective diary that he wrote while in retirement at Tiverton, Devon, from 1785 to 1786. A rollicking account of amorous adventures mimicking the style of <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> and <span class="italic">Roderick Random</span>, it depicts a fearlessly iconoclastic and rebellious youth, jumping from one merry prank or drunken brawl to the next, and from one (often married) woman's bed to another.<br>
<br>On 14 July 1760, aged sixteen, Stedman became an ensign in General John Stuart's regiment in the Scots brigade and spent the next eleven years defending outposts in the Low Countries while continuing his &#145;scandalous life&#146;  (diary, 29 Nov 1785), consistently &#145;studying to be singular in as much as can be so&#146;  (Stedman, &#145;1786&#146;, 20). In 1771, saddened by the death of his father and in debt, he responded to a call for volunteers to put down a slave rebellion in the wealthy South American colony of Surinam. He sailed from the Netherlands, with the rank of captain, in December 1772, and arrived in Surinam in February 1773.<br>
<br>Soon after his arrival Stedman married, by local custom, Joanna (1757&#150;1782), a beautiful fifteen-year-old mixed-race slave, but he was ultimately unsuccessful at obtaining her freedom. They had a son, Johnny (whose freedom Stedman bought), who was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and was drowned at sea off Jamaica in 1792 as a midshipman in the British navy. Joanna, who remained in Surinam when Stedman left, died&#151;possibly by poisoning&#151;on 5 November 1782. Stedman left Surinam on 1 April 1777, returned to the Netherlands, and rejoined Stuart's regiment. At Maastricht on 2 February 1782 he married Adriana (1764&#150;1829), daughter of Adrian Wierts van Coehorn, and they had five children. Stedman was promoted lieutenant-colonel by the prince of Orange in 1783, but he sold his commission the same year when, as a consequence of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the Scots brigade was disbanded, and he settled with his family in England.<br>
<br>Stedman wrote one of the most detailed descriptions ever written of an eighteenth-century slave plantation society, his <span class="italic">Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</span> (1796). His intimate dealings with members of all social classes, from the governor and the wealthiest planters to the most oppressed slaves and maroon rebels, gave him unique opportunities to describe the full panorama of colonial life&#151;the mistreatment of slaves by sadistic masters, the courage of the rebels in battle, the daily lives of Indian and African slaves, and exotic flora and fauna.<br>
<br>Stedman's <span class="italic">Narrative</span> has been published in nearly thirty editions and in six languages. It was often called into service for the anti-slavery cause, but it is now known that the first edition in fact represented a significantly altered version of the manuscript Stedman had submitted to his publisher, Joseph Johnson, in 1790. For, unbeknown to the author, Johnson had passed the manuscript to William Thomson (1746&#150;1817), a professional editor and ghost writer, who caused the work to be &#145;mard intirely&#146;  (diary, 24 June 1795). Thanks to Stedman's diverse diaries, notebooks, and other papers (now in the James Ford Bell Library, Minneapolis), it has been possible to reconstruct the history of the <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, from its beginnings in the form of a log kept in Surinam in the 1770s, sometimes jotted down on cartridges or even on &#145;a <i>Bleached bone</i>&#146; when paper was unavailable, through the various stages of writing, editing, and negotiating with Johnson that led to the first edition.<br>
<br>Stedman considered himself a gifted artist, and presented his publisher with 106 drawings, mainly watercolours, most made on the spot in Surinam. Johnson employed a number of engravers for the book's eighty-one plates, including Francesco Bartolozzi, who signed Stedman's self-portrait frontispiece, and William Blake, who was responsible for sixteen plates that &#145;have long been recognized as among the best executed and most generally interesting of all his journeyman work&#146;  (Keynes, 98). Each of Blake's arresting engravings successfully blends his own inner vision with Stedman's. The often-reproduced slave tortures (pl. 11, 35, 71) convey extraordinary power and pathos, the wonderfully humanoid monkeys and the skinning of the giant anaconda (pl. 18, 42, 19) sprightly humour, and his emblematic representation of <span class="italic">Europe Supported by Africa &amp; America</span> (pl. 80) demure but unmistakable sensuality.<br>
<br>The heavily edited first edition distorted Stedman's views on race, slavery, and social justice, and turned them more towards a pro-slavery position. Softened or deleted in the 1796 publication were his admiration for Africans&#151;their institutions, morals, hygiene&#151;including the rebel slaves; his frank depiction of sex between European men and African women; and many of his remarks about the pervasiveness of misconduct and debauchery of European planters. None the less, the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> had significant contemporary impact. Upon its publication the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> observed that &#145;we have never opened any work which is so admirably calculated to excite the most heart-felt abhorrence and detestation of that grossest assault on human nature&#151;domestic slavery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, January 1797, 53).<br>
<br>After having settled in England, Stedman was confirmed in his rank by the British in 1796. He lived at Hensleigh House, near Tiverton, where he died on 1 March 1797. He was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Bickleigh, Devon, on 7 March, though not, as he had wanted, close to Bamfylde Moore Carew, the &#145;King of the Beggars&#146;.<br>
