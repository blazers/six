<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zouche,  Richard</span>  (1590&#150;1661), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, the son of Francis Zouche, lord of the manor of Anstey, Wiltshire, and, reputedly, of Philippa, sixth daughter of George Ludlow of Hill Deverel, Wiltshire, was born at Anstey. He was the great-grandson of the eighth Baron Zouche of Harringworth.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Zouche was elected a scholar of Winchester College in 1601 and, in 1607, a scholar of New College, Oxford, where in 1609 he became a fellow. He graduated BCL in 1614 and in January 1618, unusually, since he had not yet taken his doctorate, was admitted to Doctors' Commons. On 8 April 1619 he took the degree of DCL and on 30 April was admitted an advocate of the court of arches. In 1620 he succeeded his teacher John Budden as regius professor of civil law at Oxford and held the chair until his death. In 1621 and again in 1624 he was elected MP for Hythe, through the patronage of his cousin Edward, eleventh Baron Zouche, lord warden of the Cinque Ports, and in a <span class="roman">Bill on Penal Statutes</span>, he sought a proviso for the Cinque Ports.<br>
<br>It was probably in 1622 that Zouche married Sarah, daughter of John Hart, a proctor in Doctors' Commons, and sister of Dr Richard Hart, a fellow civilian; they had six children. Having to resign his fellowship on marriage, Zouche became a fellow-commoner of Wadham College until in 1625 he was appointed principal of St Alban Hall. He acted as assessor, or judge, of the vice-chancellor's court, which followed the civil law, and took part in the Laudian codification of the university statutes (1629&#150;33). In 1632 he became chancellor of the Oxford diocese and was a prebendary of Salisbury. From 1626 to 1634 he was a member of the high court of delegates. Having practised in admiralty cases for many years, he was made commissioner for piracy in London, Hampshire, and Dorset and in 1641 was appointed judge of the high court of admiralty, but was removed during the civil war.<h2>
<a name="Civilwaryears"></a>Civil war years</h2>Since Zouche was royalist in sympathy, his practice suffered during the civil war and he spent his time mainly in Oxford. Indeed, when he left London for Oxford in 1643 without paying the parliamentary subsidy, the furniture of his chambers in Doctors' Commons was confiscated by way of distress. He negotiated on behalf of the royalist forces in Oxford on their surrender in 1646. The articles allowed him and other royalists to compound for their estates without taking the covenant, and in November he was permitted to compound for interests in land at Harefield near Uxbridge, Ascott in Oxfordshire, and at Doctors' Commons at one-tenth of their value, namely &pound;333. In 1647 he was one of those who drafted the reasons given by the University of Oxford for rejecting the solemn league and covenant. Zouche must have made some accommodation with the Commonwealth, for in 1648 he was permitted by the parliamentary visitors to retain his academic offices and his son Richard was restored to a demyship at Magdalen College of which he had been deprived. Later Zouche became a member of the mixed commission of common lawyers and civilians set up to investigate the charge of murder against the Portuguese ambassador's brother, Don Pantaleone Sa, who was condemned and executed in 1654. Three years later Zouche published a justification of the commissioners' view that an ambassador's exemption from prosecution does not extend to a member of his suite: <span class="italic">Solutio quaestionis veteris et novae, sive, De legati delinquentis judice competente</span>, which was published at Oxford in 1657, at Cologne in 1662, at Berlin in 1669, and translated into German at Jena in 1717.<br>
<br>Zouche was a candidate for election as the keeper of the archives of the university in 1658 and in support of his case prepared a manuscript collection of the privileges of the University of Oxford, of which there is a transcript in St John's College Library, but he was defeated, possibly as a result of sharp practice, by Dr John Wallis.<h2>
<a name="Publishedworks"></a>Published works</h2>On becoming professor Zouche embarked on a systematic survey of the whole field of law in a series of short books intended for students of the civil law and published between 1629 and 1650. He explains the whole scheme in the preface to the last of the series, the famous textbook on international law.<br>
<br>It begins with <span class="italic">Elementa jurisprudentiae</span>, published at Oxford in 1629 and 1636, at Leiden in 1652 and 1653, and at The Hague in 1665, which is illustrated by maxims, definitions, and general rules, taken exclusively from the texts of the civil law, and divided, as were most of his writings, into substantive law (<i>jus</i>) and civil procedure (<i>judicium</i>). In the <span class="italic">Elementa</span> his purpose was to show the foundations of law and procedure for a community in general. The aim of jurisprudence is the enforcement of justice, and the principles of justice are derived from natural law, the law of nations, and civil law. They apply to the human communities that exist between private individuals, between sovereign and subject, between persons in special relationships, and between one sovereign and another. Of the means by which justice is applied to these relationships, the most important is <i>judicium</i>, legal procedure.<br>
<br>After mapping out the field of law Zouche came to the law of these various communities, his emphasis being on the laws applicable in England, which were of practical importance to civilians, ecclesiastical law, military law, maritime law, and international law. The largest community is that which subsists between one private person and another and between private persons and princes  (<span class="italic">Descriptio juris et judicii temporalis, secundum consuetudines feudales et Normannicas</span>, 1636, reprinted in R. Moket, <span class="italic">Tractatus de politeia ecclesiae Anglicanae</span>, 1683). The sequence continued with five short monographs devoted to special communities: feudal law, based on the customs of Milan and Normandy; ecclesiastical law, essentially Anglican canon law; sacred law, which is concerned with religion and pious causes; military law, concerned with military service in war and peace and with the law of nobility; and maritime law, concerned with navigation and commerce. Finally he came to international law: <span class="italic">Juris et judicii fecialis, sive, Juris inter gentes et quaestionum de eodem explicatio</span>, printed at Oxford in 1650, at Leiden in 1651, at The Hague in 1659, at Mainz in 1661, and translated into German as <span class="italic">Allgemeines V&ouml;lkerrecht</span> at Frankfurt in 1666; it was edited, with an English translation, by T. E. Holland in <span class="italic">The Classics of International Law</span> (2 vols., 1911). Because of the paucity of sources in this area of law, Zouche says that he found it necessary to consult other authors, in particular Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius. His method was to set out first those propositions of law as to which there was little doubt (part 1) and then, where the matter appeared to be controversial, to treat the law as a set of open questions, with arguments both ways (part 2). In this pioneering work Zouche was one of the first writers to treat international law systematically as a whole, and essentially as a law that applied in time of peace. He treated war as a means of enforcing the rights that arose from status, from ownership, from duty or from wrongdoing in time of peace. He adopted an empirical and positivist approach, not based on natural law or religion, and drew his examples both from classical antiquity and from recent European history. He argued in favour of the term <i>jus inter gentes</i> (&#145;law between nations&#146;) rather than <i>jus gentium</i> (&#145;law of nations&#146;) to describe the subject.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Cases and Questions Resolved According to the Civil Law</span> (1652) is a casebook of problems taken from the texts of Justinian's <span class="italic">Digest</span>, with full references, primarily for the use of students of the civil law. It was originally intended to be published in &#145;the proper language of the civil law&#146;, but, he explained cautiously, it appeared exceptionally in English, &#145;that others also might discerne that the study of that learning conduceth to the knowledge of some things worthy of consideration&#146;. Although the Roman fact-situations might appear &#145;forraigne&#146;, the doubts expressed and their resolution could be applied to more familiar topics. <span class="italic">Specimen quaestionum juris civilis</span> (1653) was published anonymously. It is a series of civil-law problems on which different views are found in the literature, arranged in ten classes and addressed to students. Each problem is accompanied merely by references to enable the student to find the different opinions in the texts. <span class="italic">Quaestionum juris civilis centuria, in decem classes distributa</span>, published at Oxford in 1660 and at London in 1682, follows the same scheme as the <span class="italic">Specimen</span>, although the problems treated in the ten classes are somewhat amplified and the arguments are set out extensively, instead of by reference only. In the preface, written from St Alban Hall in 1659, Zouche refers back to the <span class="italic">Specimen</span> and says that these &#145;efforts of his old age&#146; were intended specially for the alumni of Winchester and New College, in which he himself had learned classics and civil law. In the same mode a collection of logical, rhetorical, and moral maxims, <span class="italic">Eruditionis ingenuae specimen, scilicet artium logicae, dialecticae et rhetoricae nec non moralis philosophiae</span> (1657), illustrated from definitions, maxims, and opinions taken from Cicero's writings, was published anonymously but introduced from the &#145;Wicchamical museum&#146; of St Alban Hall in 1656.<br>
<br>Zouche's last book was <span class="italic">The jurisdiction of the admiralty of England asserted against Sir Edward Coke's &#145;Articuli admiralitatis&#146; in chap. xxii of his &#145;Jurisdiction of courts&#146;</span>, a polemical work, published posthumously (1663, repr. in G. Malynes's <span class="italic">Consuetudo, vel, Lex mercatoria</span>, 1686). Dr T. Baldwyn of Doctors' Commons certified in a preface that he received the manuscript from Zouche himself to be printed. Coke's attack on the admiralty jurisdiction is systematically refuted. Zouche argues that the law merchant did not derogate from the common law; admiralty law and common law coexist and litigants may choose their court; the special admiralty procedure makes it more convenient to litigants.<br>
<br>With the end of the Commonwealth, Zouche's fortunes improved. He was a member of the commission sent to Oxford to review the work of the parliamentary visitors and to restore those who had been deprived of their posts. In July 1660 he appears as president of Doctors' Commons. On 4 February 1661 he recovered his old position as judge of the court of Admiralty, but on 1 March 1661 he died in London at Doctors' Commons and was buried in Fulham parish church. In his will he divided his estate into three parts for his wife, Sarah, who lived on until 1683, being buried in St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, for his son Richard and for his daughter Anne, who had married Robert Say, provost of Oriel. (Another daughter, Sarah, married Dr Lydall, warden of Merton.)<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>Zouche left a considerable body of published work. His earliest publication was a rather feeble poem in English called <span class="italic">The Dove, or, Passages of Cosmography</span> (1613), which described the known world after the manner of the <span class="italic">Periegesis</span> of Dionysius Periegetes. His only other literary work is possibly <span class="italic">The Sophister, a Comedy</span> (1639), an anonymous work which is attributed to Zouche in an old note in the Bodleian Library copy. In his own field, however, he made a major contribution to the pedagogic literature of the civil law, usually writing in Latin. He was descriptive rather than original, inclined to synthesis rather than analysis.<br>
<br>His contemporary Anthony Wood, describes Zouche as:<blockquote>an exact artist, a subtile logician, expert historian, and for the knowledge in, and practice of, the civil law, the chief person of his time; as his works, much esteemed beyond the seas (where several of them are reprinted), partly testify. He was so well vers'd also in the statutes of the university, and controversies between the members thereof and the city, that none after Twyne's death went beyond him. As his birth was noble, so was his behaviour and discourse, and as personable and handsome, so naturally sweet, pleasing and affable. The truth is that there was nothing wanting but a froward spirit for his advancement. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.511)</blockquote>Levack in his chapter on law in the seventeenth-century volume of the <span class="italic">History of the University of Oxford</span>, describes him as &#145;clearly the most distinguished civilian [lawyer] that Oxford produced in the seventeenth century. He was also the last of his kind: an English civil lawyer whose writings acquired a durable European reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 563).<br>
