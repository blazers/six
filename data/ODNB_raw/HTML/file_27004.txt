<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taverner,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1490&#150;1545), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was probably a native of Lincolnshire. In 1525/6 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. sufficed to hire a man to escort him from Boston to visit his &#145;country&#146;, indicating family settlement in south Lincolnshire within one or two days' ride of Boston.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareerc14901526"></a>Education and early career, c.1490&#150;1526</h2>It appears likely that Taverner was educated as a chorister of a major church choir. Those of Holy Trinity collegiate church, Tattershall, Lincolnshire, and of Boston parish church (St Botolph's) were close to home and sufficiently illustrious to offer him suitable training and experience; nevertheless, he was not so recorded at either, and it was not uncommon for choirboys of unusual talent to be engaged far from home. The composer cannot be identified with the John Tavernar who in 1514&#150;15 was admitted an associated member (<i>secularis</i>) of the London guild of parish clerks and professional musicians (the Confraternity of St Nicholas), and indeed nothing is known of him before late 1524 when, as a singing-man of the choir of Tattershall College, he received a substantial gratuity at St Botolph's, Boston, as a guest singer in its choir. His designation as Master Taverner indicates his achievement already of significant eminence in his profession by the mid-1520s.<br>
<br>The Tattershall College choir, of sixteen men and ten boys, had long enjoyed a vigorous and productive musical tradition; by the time he left in 1526 Taverner was probably some thirty-five years old, and a fair proportion of his surviving music may already have been composed. Pieces attributable to his Tattershall years or even earlier appear likely to include the Marian antiphon <span class="italic">Ave Dei patris filia</span> and the mass <span class="italic">O Michael</span>, which display many features symptomatic of composition by an inexperienced but highly talented and ambitious hand; also likely to be early is the antiphon <span class="italic">Gaude plurimum</span>. Meanwhile, suitable for use on Tattershall's patronal festival was the monumental and marvellously accomplished mass <span class="italic">Gloria tibi trinitas</span>; if composed at Tattershall, as seems probable, this shows the extent to which Taverner had already achieved maturity as a composer well before his departure for Oxford.<h2>
<a name="CardinalCollegeOxford15261530"></a>Cardinal College, Oxford, 1526&#150;1530</h2>Taverner was present at Tattershall on 17 May 1525, but by now his celebrity was such that in the autumn of that year he was commissioned to become the inaugural master of the choristers of the choir of Cardinal College, Oxford, newly founded by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, archbishop of York. Wolsey's agent considered Taverner &#145;very meet&#146; for the job; he, however, evidently knowing his worth, was loath to co-operate, alleging his satisfaction with both his work and his remuneration at Tattershall, and &#145;that he is in way of a gud mariage, whiche he shuld loose if he dydd reamove frome thens&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/139, fol. 239<i>r</i>). Nevertheless, he was prevailed upon to relent. From 25 March 1526 he was on the college payroll; by May he was using Wolsey's royal commission to recruit singers for his new choir (from Boston, among other places), and his work in Oxford began in earnest with the opening of Cardinal College on 19 October. His stipend was a generous &pound;15 per year.<br>
<br>The college statutes required the master of the choir to be &#145;exceptionally skilled in music&#146; (<i>musices peritissimus</i>) and made correspondingly elaborate provision for the musical refinement of the services. Its membership of twenty-six men and sixteen boys ranked the choir as among the greatest in the land. However, there appears to be no substance in the assertion that the Forrest&#150;Heyther partbooks of <i>c</i>.1528&#150;30 were compiled at Cardinal College or assembled under Taverner's direction or used there by his choir.<br>
<br>The statutes laid special emphasis on the performance with polyphony of the daily Lady mass, and within the Gyffard partbooks of <i>c</i>.1555&#150;8 one section devoted to music for this observance preserves works by Taverner possibly dating from his Oxford years, including both the <span class="italic">Leroy <span class="roman">Kyrie</span></span> and the mass <span class="italic">Western Wynd</span>. The <span class="roman">Kyrie</span> takes as <i>cantus firmus</i> one of a body of pre-existing abstract melodies known as &#145;squares&#146;, and in the mass Taverner pursued this compositional principle to an unprecedented but logical conclusion. On thirty-six almost unvaried statements of what may well have been a newly composed melody of his own creation he based an entire mass, distinguished by a flow of contrapuntal invention as seemingly inexhaustible as it is melodious and memorable. Taverner's melody was later seen to bear a superficial similarity to a courtly song &#145;Western wind, when wilt thou blow&#146;, which misleadingly led the name &#145;Western Wynd&#146; to become attached to this mass. Other works for Lady mass composed by this time included a mass for boys' voices (now lost) and <span class="roman">Kyries</span> and sequences (fragments survive) sung in 1529 at King's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>At Cardinal College the feasts of St Nicholas and St William of York enjoyed an elevated status. Taverner's setting of <span class="italic">Sospitati dedit aegros</span> was proper to the first, while for the daily votive antiphon to St William prescribed in Wolsey's statutes he composed a concise and elegant setting of words which probably originally began &#145;O Wilhelme, pastor bone&#146; and included a prayer for the good estate of Wolsey as founder. Also specified in the college statutes was the daily performance of the antiphons <span class="italic">Ave Maria</span> and <span class="italic">Sancte Deus</span>, for each of which Taverner composed succinct but clearly articulated settings for five-voice choir.<br>
<br>Probably contemporary is Taverner's five-voice mass deriving some of its music from <span class="italic">O Wilhelme, pastor bone</span>, possibly composed for the tercentenary of the canonization of St William (21 March 1527). Eschewing floridity of expression, this seems concise and direct, and earned itself the descriptive (and by no means pejorative) nickname &#145;Small devotion&#146;. Possibly contemporary is the mass <span class="italic">Mater Christi</span>, derived in a similar manner from Taverner's hybrid Marian&#150;Jesus antiphon <span class="italic">Mater Christi sanctissima</span>. The composition of a paired mass and votive antiphon for use together on a great feast was by no means new in England; Taverner was developing a particular mode of pairing, importing into the mass by &#145;parody&#146; whole sections of pre-existing music first created for the antiphon.<br>
<br>Taverner's four years at Oxford were not uneventful. Since about 1526 there had developed there a covert cell of religious dissidents, primarily clerics and students, attracted to Lutheranism; its members were serviced by one Thomas Garrard, a clandestine purveyor of heretical books. Between 19 and 29 February 1528 the cell was exposed, and Garrard's associates were rounded up for questioning; among them were John Radley and Thomas Lawney, respectively lay clerk and chaplain of Cardinal College choir, and Taverner himself. Doubtless Lawney and Radley had encountered Garrard at Boston, where until 1526 they had been members of St Botolph's choir and he had been schoolmaster (1524&#150;6). Taverner had recruited Lawney and Radley from Boston to Oxford, unwittingly facilitating thereby Garrard's introduction to his Oxford clientele. Six members of Cardinal College, all clerics, were imprisoned for interrogation. Taverner and Radley, being laymen, and therefore theologically unlearned, were more lightly treated. Radley confessed to being Garrard's clandestine host during his Oxford visits. Taverner was associated more with one of the clerics, John Clerk, a senior canon of Cardinal College, whose suspect books Taverner confessed to having hidden under the floorboards of the choirboys' practice-room, and to a little of whose compromising correspondence with Garrard he was privy.<br>
<br>Their confessions were reported to Wolsey; to him, however, only clerical Lutheranism appeared at this time to be actually dangerous. He dismissed both Taverner and Radley as &#145;unlerned and nott to be regarded&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/47, fol. 111<i>r</i>), and beyond the frightening experience of arrest, interrogation, and confession neither was imprisoned or otherwise punished. Such leniency was well judged. Although apparently he was led into at least evangelical heterodoxy by superiors and colleagues, Taverner's association with these covert Lutherans cannot be lightly dismissed; no one flirted with heresy merely to oblige his friends. The death in custody of four of the suspects, including Taverner's friend Clerk, seems to have sufficed to remind him of the virtues of orthodoxy, and there is no sign that ever again was he tempted to dabble in any form of heterodox belief.<br>
<br>In April 1528 Thomas Cromwell reported enthusiastically to Wolsey on the standard of the liturgical service in Cardinal College chapel, &#145;so devout, solemn and full of harmony that in mine opinion it hath few peers&#146;  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 2nd ser., 2.139), and by July Taverner stood as high as ever in Wolsey's favour, attending upon him at Hampton Court with four of his ablest choirboys. However, soon after Wolsey's dismissal from royal service in November 1529 the choir of Cardinal College began to be run down, and by April 1530 provision for the conduct of the choral service was becoming sufficiently threatened for Taverner to take his departure.<h2>
<a name="Boston15301545"></a>Boston, 1530&#150;1545</h2>It appears that Taverner now returned to Boston; certainly it was as &#145;Taverner of Boston&#146; that he was commonly known to his immediate posterity, including John Foxe, Thomas Whythorne, and John Baldwin. It is likely that he was recruited to the choir maintained in St Botolph's parish church by and at the expense of the Guild of St Mary established therein. Certainly in 1538&#150;9 he was recorded as recently a tenant of one of the guild's domestic properties, the record of whose tenancy shows it to have been reserved for occupation by members of its choral staff. It is not unlikely that Taverner now served the Boston choir as master of the choristers, enjoying employment there (at not less than its established salary of &pound;17 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) from 1530 until probably 1536 or 1537.<br>
<br>Within this magnificent church the Guild of St Mary maintained a choir of (until about 1536) some eighteen to twenty men and eight to ten boys. To John Leland the church was &#145;servid so with singging, and that of cunning men, as no paroche is in al England&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Itinerary of John Leland, in or about the Years 1535&#150;1543</span>, ed. L. T. Smith, 5 vols., 1906&#150;10, 5.33). Possibly it was for Boston that Taverner wrote his masterpiece, the festal mass <span class="italic">Corona spinea</span>. The crown which to the Guild of St Mary was of significance so great that it was displayed as a badge on the livery of its almsmen may very well have been the crown of thorns, so rendering this a piece appropriate for high mass on any of the guild's greatest feasts. The unidentified <i>cantus firmus</i> may be a chant from the use of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Simultaneously Taverner was also exploring a style increasingly animated by systematic use of imitation, as in the Jesus antiphon <span class="italic">O splendor gloriae</span>. Moreover, it was probably at this time that he developed the genre of choral office responsory composed on a monorhythmic <i>cantus firmus</i>. Aurally <span class="italic">Dum transisset sabbatum</span> is a work of the greatest refinement; yet within the apparently effortless flow of its polyphony lies embedded and concealed the <i>cantus firmus</i> disposed in severe and unyielding semibreves. This technique permitted participation by choir chaplains unlearned in polyphonic notation, who were unlikely to have been employed at Cardinal College, but very likely&#151;in the guise of, for example, the six &#145;choir priests&#146; maintained by the Guild of St George&#151;to have been encountered at St Botolph's.<br>
<br>About 1536&#150;7 Taverner's employment by the Guild of St Mary ended. The prodigious spiritual privileges available to subscribing members, including plenary remission of sins and the &#145;Scala coeli&#146; indulgence for the delivery of souls from purgatory, were of papal origin. Consequently the gathering of membership funds, the source of the guild's enormous income, became illegal on the break with Rome in 1534, and the &#145;Scala coeli&#146; indulgence was outlawed altogether under the ten articles of 1536. Probably the guild hereupon became unable to continue Taverner's remuneration, and certainly by May 1538 he had chosen to retire altogether from employment in church music. It appears that, either through accumulated personal means or through advantage arising from marriage (or both), by this time he was a wealthy man, able to choose not to seek another job, but to spend the last years of his life as a prosperous and respected burgher, and composer, of his adopted town. Much later, John Foxe, knowing of Taverner's brush with Lutheranism at Oxford and anxious to portray him as an enduring stalwart for evangelical truth, remarked that &#145;This Taverner repented him very muche that he had made Songes to Popish Ditties in the time of his blindnes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5.50). It seems that Foxe, himself born and partly brought up in Boston, had heard correctly of a final withdrawal by Taverner from an active career in church music, but was merely guessing at, and succeeding only in entirely misrepresenting, Taverner's actual motivation.<br>
<br>The date of Taverner's marriage to Rose (<i>d</i>. 1553; a widow with two daughters, who sprang originally from one of Boston's leading families, the Parrowes) is not known. However, already by May 1538 he had lately been leasing a large family mansion on Wormgate, Boston, at a substantial annual rent of 40<i>s</i>. By 1541 he was styled &#145;gentleman&#146; and was beginning to appear as one of the town's leading worthies. In 1537 he was admitted to membership of Boston's select Guild of Corpus Christi, whose objectives were the veneration of the transubstantiated sacrament and the provision of masses for the souls of members deceased. Taverner's commitment to such pillars of Catholic orthodoxy located him in not only the religious but also the social mainstream, and this encouraged him to cultivate the favour of Thomas Cromwell, now the king's principal secretary, with whom it is likely that he had become acquainted when both were employed within Wolsey's circle. On 11 September 1538 Taverner reported that the town had complied with an order from Cromwell for the demolition and incineration of the rood screen and figures from St Botolph's Church. His report included no observation that he had himself been present or had participated in any way. Meanwhile, he endeavoured to capitalize on Cromwell's favour by seeking the opportunity to purchase a local wardship, and on another occasion by petitioning for Cromwell's favourable intervention in a kinsman's lawsuit.<br>
<br>Evidently Taverner was known locally as a kindly individual, and it was to him that in 1537&#150;8 the friars of Boston came to lament their loss of public support and consequent utter indigence. He assured them of his personal goodwill and generosity, and obliged them by writing to Cromwell urging a speedy determination of the fate of the local friaries. His benevolent intervention paid him good dividends; following the surrender of the houses he and one other Boston businessman were granted the opportunity to purchase the sites from the crown.<br>
<br>Taverner also took much self-sacrificing trouble as an executor of the will of one Roger Meres. Indeed, another Boston businessman, Anthony Robertson, recollecting how he had undertaken complete repayment to Taverner of a loan of &pound;20 despite the latter's inability to cancel the paperwork through its temporary misplacement, credited him as &#145;a verye honest man&#146; in whose word and promise he placed &#145;an especyall trust and confidens&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C1/1259, nos. 14, 17). Taverner's stature in Boston appears steadily to have grown in the last years of his life. He served as treasurer of the Corpus Christi guild in 1541, 1542, and 1543, and upon the grant to Boston of its first municipal charter in May 1545 his prominence was sealed by his appointment as one of the twelve aldermen of its inaugural governing council.<br>
<br>Although no longer employed in church music, Taverner may very well have continued after 1536 to compose for St Botolph's choir, which&#151;albeit with much reduced forces on much reduced pay&#151;remained in existence right up until 1548. During these years of hardship it is likely that its boys' section was disbanded (in 1538 Leland had noted the presence only of singing-men), so creating the circumstances satisfied by Taverner's late compositions, all of which are for men's voices alone; they include the <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> for four voices, the five-voice <span class="roman">Te Deum</span>, the fine four-voice arrangement of <span class="italic">Dum transisset sabbatum</span>, and the <span class="italic">Meane mass</span>. These exhibit an increasing concern for directness of expression assimilated into a disposition of imitation now sufficiently systematic to stand beside free invention as the prime melodic generator.<br>
<br>Early in August 1545 Taverner's health appears suddenly to have collapsed, an associate perceiving that &#145;the said Taverner did greatly decay&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C1/1164, no. 44). Such was his affliction that when on 18 October 1545 he died, probably in Boston, he had made no will. Rose Taverner, who had busily settled his affairs at the beginning of August, was granted the administration of his effects; his property included tenements in Boston and agricultural land in the vicinity. He was buried within St Botolph's Church, beneath the great west tower. He had no children and was survived only by his widow, who died between 1 and 18 May 1553, and by a younger brother, William.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Taverner's pre-eminence among contemporary English composers was complete, not least for his mastery of stylistic diversity and range of genre, extending even to four secular songs and to the untexted and strangely scored <span class="italic">Quemadmodum</span>. Indeed, irrespective of their different stylistic heritages, his work emerges impressively from comparison with that of Adrian Willaert, Nicolas Gombert, or Crist&oacute;bal de Morales, the most illustrious of his continental contemporaries. During a composing life of only some thirty-five years he took to its culmination the prevailing English style of expansive, virtuosic, and sonically luxuriant polyphony, and exhibited in particular a sure-footed degree of control over the most grandly conceived designs. He also forged a successor style more concise in its expression, terse in its thought, and economical in its deployment of melodic material, animated in part by the working of successive imitative points capable of generating on their own the characteristics of entire musical phrases. This style could either supersede entirely the former melismatic luxuriance (as in the <span class="italic">Meane mass</span>) or be combined with it (as in the four-voice <span class="roman">Magnificat</span>).<br>
<br>Though similar to features found somewhat earlier in continental Catholic composition, these initiatives seem likely to have arisen simply because like circumstances were giving rise independently to like developments, rather than as a consequence of some putative acquaintance on Taverner's part directly with continental music. Certainly the devotionally very limited substance of the Henrician Reformation up to 1545 was not such as to create on its own account any local stimulus towards modifying the prevailing manner of musical composition for the church services. And irrespective of surface stylistic trends, there remain underlying all Taverner's finest works his abiding &#145;gift of incisive melodic invention, his capacity to create a sense of coherent discourse by generating extended lines out of small motifs, and his purposeful sense of progress expressed through control of harmonic rhythm and direction&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Taverner's influence on his younger colleagues and successors was extensive. Christopher Tye and John Sheppard wrote masses both on Taverner's &#145;Western Wynd&#146; <i>cantus firmus</i> and in emulation of his <span class="italic">Meane mass</span>. The suave elegance of the four-voice &#145;In nomine [Domini]&#146; passage of the <span class="roman">Benedictus</span> of the mass <span class="italic">Gloria tibi trinitas</span> proved amenable for performance by viols, and spawned a whole genre of instrumental composition that lasted as far as Henry Purcell. In 1547&#150;9 the enduring value of Taverner's music was recognized in the adaptation of two of his masses to the words of the new vernacular communion service, and later in the fitting of English words to two of his votive antiphons and to the original &#145;In nomine&#146;. Influences emanating from the <span class="italic">Meane mass</span> have been discerned in William Byrd's four-voice mass.<br>
<br>Taverner's pre-eminence was evident not only to the creators of repertory manuscripts of his own day, but also to the nostalgic anthologizers who in Elizabeth I's reign strove to preserve the treasures of the pre-Reformation past. In their collections are now to be found the majority of Taverner's surviving works. Never entirely unknown to music historians, these were systematically recovered and published in the 1920s, and since the 1960s have been extensively performed and recorded.<br>
