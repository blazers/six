<span class="headword">Maguire, Sir  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Aodh  M&aacute;g Uidhir]</span>, lord of Fermanagh  (<em>d.</em> 1600), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was the eldest son of C&uacute; Chonnacht Maguire, lord of Fermanagh (<i>d</i>. 1589), Irish chieftain, and his wife, Nuala, or Fionnghuala, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20556/', "Manus O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell")</script>. Although Hugh Maguire was recognized by his father as his heir, his succession to the position of Maguire was challenged on C&uacute; Chonnacht's death in 1589. Rival branches of the Maguire kin group nominated Connor Roe Maguire as lord &#145;according [to] all the customs and ceremonies in the country&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/170/11). Maguire's claim prevailed, however, because he received support from the O'Donnells and from the Irish privy council, which had courted C&uacute; Chonnacht and hoped to maintain friendly contact with his son. Government recognition of Maguire was confirmed in 1591 when he was knighted in a ceremony in Christ Church in Dublin.<br>
<br>Maguire's inauguration as chief coincided with a period of considerable instability in the north-west. From 1585 Sir Richard Bingham, president of Connaught, steadily extended his control in the region, establishing crown garrisons and appointing English-style local government officials. The beaching of ships from the Spanish Armada on the northern coast in 1588 led to an intensification of his military rule as rumours circulated that Gaelic lords, including Maguire and Brian O'Rourke, were liaising with the Spaniards and petitioning them to return with a second armada. In 1589 Bingham's brother George Bingham launched an attack on O'Rourke's country of Leitrim which bordered Maguire's territory to the west. O'Rourke fled Ireland but Maguire offered protection to his son Brian &Oacute;g O'Rourke, who subsequently married Maguire's sister. Maguire also expressed his support for the MacMahons, whose lordship of Monaghan lay to the east of Fermanagh, and also witnessed increased government interference in 1589 when the ruling MacMahon was executed and plans were initiated by Sir William Fitzwilliam, the lord deputy, to subdivide the entire lordship. While the Monaghan land settlement was being finalized, Bingham entered Fermanagh and, according to Maguire, killed men, women, and children and took away large preys of cattle and horses.<br>
<br>The ruthlessness of the Bingham regime in the north-west was a major factor in the subsequent conflict in Ulster and Maguire's pivotal role in it. Maguire later claimed that he supported the Nine Years' War not &#145;in respect of any combinations with any foreign enemy or of any malice towards Her Majesty but through the occasion of his hard usage&#146; from English officials and, in particular, from the Binghams  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/186/96). In 1592 Maguire signalled his opposition to government policy when he welcomed Hugh Roe O'Donnell to Fermanagh following the latter's escape from Dublin Castle. One of O'Donnell's first actions on his return home was to expel the English sheriff, Captain Humphrey Willis, from his territory.<br>
<br>The growing hostility to government policy in north Connaught and Ulster was compounded by the actions of members of the hierarchy of the Catholic church. Maguire was a patron of Edmund MacGauran, titular archbishop of Armagh from 1587 to 1593. At an episcopal meeting in O'Donnell's country in the winter of 1592, MacGauran reported on his recent visit to Spain and the plans of Philip II to send a second armada to England and Ireland. His report was followed by letters from Maguire, O'Donnell, and others to the Spanish king requesting military aid. The spring of 1593 was a crucial time for Maguire and for the developing crisis in Ulster. Much to Maguire's anger, Willis was appointed sheriff of Fermanagh following his expulsion from Tyrconnell. He asserted in vain that he had given Fitzwilliam 300 cows as a bribe to keep English officials out of his lordship. Willis entered Fermanagh in the early months of 1593 with 100 soldiers and as many women and boys, all of whom lived on the spoil of the country. Maguire claimed that Willis's men &#145;having killed one of the best gents in the country named the son of Edmund Mac Hugh Maguire whose head they cut off they hurled it from place to place as a football&#146;  (LPL, Carew MS 617, fol. 286). Maguire confronted Willis and his followers, forcing them to take refuge in a church from which they only escaped with their lives when Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, intervened to secure them a safe conduct out of Fermanagh.<br>
<br>It was also in late spring 1593 that Maguire was reported to have married one of Tyrone's daughters, whose name is unknown, the marriage forming part of the labyrinthine network of family connections which the earl created in Ulster. This alliance coincided with an escalation of Maguire's resistance to the Bingham regime. In May 1593 Maguire's troops, led by his brother Shane Maguire, raided George Bingham's headquarters at Ballymote Castle, co. Sligo. The attack was followed up in June by the burning of the territory around Tulsk, co. Roscommon, where Sir Richard Bingham was encamped. Brian &Oacute;g O'Rourke and the O'Hagans, Tyrone's foster brothers, accompanied Maguire's soldiers in their expeditions into Connaught, as did MacGauran, who was killed in the raid on Tulsk. Maguire's military network convinced Bingham that he was not acting alone but had the support of O'Donnell and Tyrone.<br>
<br>In summer 1593 the Irish privy council still believed, however, that its best hope of restoring stability in Ulster lay with Tyrone. He was appointed commissioner to conclude a peace settlement with Maguire. The negotiations appear to have stalled on Maguire's demand for reassurance that the Binghams would have no jurisdiction in Fermanagh. Tyrone's failure to reach an agreement with Maguire resulted in the latter being proclaimed a traitor in September and in a military campaign into Fermanagh commanded by Sir Nicholas Bagenal, marshal of the army, aided by Sir Richard Bingham. Tyrone assisted this campaign, which had its most noticeable success in February 1594, when Enniskillen Castle was seized by government troops.<br>
<br>The capture of Enniskillen was followed by a siege of the castle by Maguire, in the company of O'Donnell and Cormac Mac Baron O'Neill, Tyrone's brother. The besiegers won a significant victory in the summer when they attacked a relief force near the River Arney, south of Enniskillen, called thereafter B&eacute;al Atha Na mBriosgadh (&#145;the ford of the biscuits&#146;) because of the large quantities of biscuit supplies left behind by the fleeing troops. Through the subsequent year Maguire and O'Donnell maintained their military resistance, raiding Longford in April and retaking Enniskillen Castle in May. Although Maguire's actions between early 1593 and May 1595 were crucial in initiating the conflict in Ulster, he never held a dominant position among the rebels. The suspicion of Bingham and other English officials that he was used as a &#145;forerunner&#146; for Tyrone was probably correct  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1592&#150;6</i>, 485). When Tyrone assumed the leadership of the rebellion in June 1595 Maguire's subsidiary role became clear: he was assigned the position of cavalry commander under the earl's overall direction. Maguire was included in the negotiations between Tyrone and O'Donnell and crown officials in 1595&#150;6 and 1597 but he was always a junior partner. His requests focused on limiting government involvement in his lordship and, in particular, on keeping Fermanagh free from English troops.<br>
<br>Maguire's subordinate status was also emphasized in the early months of 1598 when the new president of Connaught, Sir Conyers Clifford, received the submission of Brian &Oacute;g O'Rourke. Tyrone, concerned that Maguire might be tempted to join with Brian Oge, apprehended him for a short period. By August, however, Maguire was firmly back in Tyrone's camp as he led the cavalry troops at the battle of the Yellow Ford, the rebels' most significant military victory of the war. He also fought in the midlands in 1599 and was among those who accompanied Tyrone when he met with Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, in September.<br>
<br>In 1600 Maguire travelled with Tyrone to Munster and it was during this expedition that he was killed. He led a troop of cavalry to scour the countryside for prey and on his return made a surprise attack on Sir Warham St Leger of Mollingborne, governor of Leix (Laois), on 18 February, near the town of Cork. In the ensuing skirmish &#145;Sir Warham St Leger discharged his pistol, and shot the traitor [Maguire]; and he was striken with the other horseman's staff in the head, of which wounds either of them died; but none else on either side was slain&#146;  (Carew, 1.14). Giolla Brighde &Oacute; hEodhasa (O'Hussey) composed a poem in honour of Maguire's journey to Munster in 1600. This was later translated by James Clarence Mangan. Maguire was succeeded by his brother C&uacute; Chonnacht (<i>d</i>. 1608), who accompanied Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell, first earl of Tyrconnell, to the continent in 1607.<br>
