<span class="headword">Cox,  Owen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, came probably from a seafaring family in north-east England, though nothing certain is known of his origins. He first appears in 1646, commanding a small prize on the north-east station, where he continued in other hired merchantmen. Early in 1648 he was nominated to command the <i>Phoenix</i>, a fourth-rate vessel under construction, but the move was aborted when the squadron in the Downs mutinied in May 1648 and declared in favour of the king. His ship, the <i>Pelican</i>, was among those to defect, but he himself escaped and a few days later he and several other commanders declared their continued loyalty to parliament. He was given a new command, the <i>Recovery</i>, and sailed in autumn 1648 with the earl of Warwick's expedition to confront Rupert and the rebel fleet at Helvoetsluys. Thereafter he served in the North Sea until 1650, when he was promoted to the <i>Constant Warwick</i>, a powerful privateer part owned by Warwick and hired by the state, and sailed with Henry Appleton's squadron to protect English shipping in the straits. Cox proved a successful commander, capturing several prizes and achieving some notoriety. On the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 Appleton's squadron took refuge at Leghorn. Cox found himself with another squadron under Richard Badiley, trapped at Elba, but Badiley soon sent him back to Leghorn to Appleton and his colleagues, &#145;to put some life into them&#146;  (Badiley, 1), and he was appointed to command the <i>Bonadventure</i> there. But Appleton opposed Cox's plan to recapture the <i>Phoenix</i>, which had been captured by the Dutch in August and was now among their ships at Leghorn, and when Cox persisted Appleton tried to sack him to scupper the plan. Cox ignored him and Badiley, who had now received overall command from England, backed the project. On 20 November 1652 Cox led a party of volunteers in a daring dawn raid, boarding the <i>Phoenix</i> as she lay at anchor amid the Dutch fleet, and carried her away to Naples after fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The exploit was long remembered. At Naples he was briefly gaoled after clashing with the Spanish viceroy over the sale of a prize, and then rejoined Badiley at Elba. Together they mounted an operation to relieve Appleton's squadron, planning to approach Leghorn to draw out the Dutch, whereupon Appleton would follow and the two small English squadrons would engage the larger Dutch force simultaneously. In the action that followed, on 4 March 1653, Appleton's force came out prematurely and was totally destroyed before the other squadron was near enough to help. On his return to England, Appleton blamed the disaster on Badiley and Cox, who had led their own force safely home, but an official inquiry vindicated them, and in December Cox was awarded &pound;500 as reward and compensation for his losses. Cox retained his command of the <i>Phoenix</i>, in 1653&#150;4, and fought in the great actions against the Dutch off the Gabbard and Texel, of which he sent an account to Cromwell.<br>
<br>Following the peace of 1654 Cox withdrew or was dropped from naval service, but failing to prosper appealed in vain to Cromwell in January 1656 for relief and employment, pleading his six children, the costs of medical treatment for his earlier injuries, and &pound;400 he had lost by the capture of the <i>Bonaventure</i> at Leghorn. He may have commanded a merchant vessel in the straits later that year, but in 1658 with Sir George Ayscue he entered the service of the king of Sweden, and the two commanders and 700 seamen crossed to Sweden in November that year with William Goodsonn's expeditionary force. Cox's pugnacious spirit served the Swedes well. Commanding a fleet of ten ships in July 1659 he encountered a Dutch-Danish squadron at Ebeltoft, seized the larger vessels, burnt thirty transports, and captured 1000 Brandenburg and Imperial troops they were carrying. After firing more ships at Arhausen he returned to Sweden in triumph. His exploits had ruined Danish and Dutch plans to invade Swedish territory, and he was ennobled by Charles X of Sweden, appointed vice-admiral, and &#145;vastly rewarded&#146;  (Manley, 57). Following Sweden's peace with Denmark he returned to England in the summer of 1661, commanding the Swedish ship <i>Raphael</i> (70 guns). Though ostensibly bound for Portugal, he lay in the Downs for four months, allegedly denouncing the Restoration, commending Venner's recent Fifth Monarchist rising and predicting the speedy destruction of Charles II. He was arrested and gaoled in the Gatehouse, and Lord Chief Justice Foster hoped to find a second witness so that he could be tried for treason. None materialized, and when the Second Anglo-Dutch War broke out Cox was granted letters of marque in February 1665 as commander of the frigate <i>Nathan</i>. Dissidents urged him to use it to bring back republican exiles from the continent, or free General Lambert from Jersey. Cox was in fact planning to sail for the Mediterranean, but the ship foundered in a storm in Yarmouth road on 14 August, with the loss of all hands. The astrologer John Gadbury claimed to have warned him that the stars foretold disaster. Cox was certainly a long-standing devotee of astrology, and a client of both John Booker and William Lilly, to whom he had brought a gold chain in 1658 from the king of Sweden, as a reward for Lilly's propagandist writings.<br>
<br>Though Cox's independent spirit and tendency to ignore orders barred him from the highest positions in the Commonwealth navy, he was among its most successful and enterprising commanders.<br>
