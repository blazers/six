<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunningham, Sir  Charles Banks</span>  (1884&#150;1967), <span class="occ">colonial police officer</span>, was born in Argyll Street, Campbeltown, Argyll, on 8 May 1884, the seventh son of John Cunningham, physician, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Patrick. Educated at Cambeltown grammar school, he was initially trained in banking, and in 1902 became a member of the Institute of Bankers in Scotland. A career change followed when he joined the Indian police service as probationary assistant superintendent of police, Madras, in December 1904. He apparently had doubts about this decision, and in 1906 unsuccessfully requested permission to transfer to the imperial customs service. Settling down to police work, he rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming a district superintendent of police in 1909. A year later he was promoted to deputy commissioner of police, Madras. He was also appointed a commissioner of the corporation of Madras. He showed exceptional ability in passing the police and law examinations, as well as learning the local Dravidian languages. On 1 November 1912 he married Grace, daughter of Hugh Macnish of Campbeltown; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1915 Cunningham became commissioner of police in Travancore, a rare extra-provincial appointment which he held until 1921. From 1917 he served as a member of the legislative council of Travancore state and was appointed director of civil supplies and controller of munitions. In 1924 he was asked to review the distribution of the mufassil police, a task that enabled him to display his skills in administration and business, as well as gaining more knowledge about the police throughout the whole of the Madras presidency. After this assignment he was made district superintendent of police in Coimbatore, where he dealt with industrial unrest and displayed &#145;a toughness and vigour &hellip; which greatly commended itself to a government which saw the growing restiveness of the industrial proletariat as a major law and order problem&#146;  (Arnold, 77).<br>
<br>Cunningham was made a deputy inspector-general in January 1928, and in May 1928 he returned to Madras as acting commissioner of police, the previous incumbent having been removed after failing to prevent a nationalist riot. It fell to Cunningham to restore confidence within the police and to reorganize the force into a more effective tool in public order situations. With his characteristic energy and attention to detail he wrote a thorough report that proposed a number of reforms, including better pay and conditions, strengthening and retraining the armed reserve, and the creation of a deputy commissioner's post with responsibility for unrest and disorder. He also proposed that the police should be given their own switchboard in the main exchange, since previously police calls had no priority over civilian traffic. His proposals were almost all accepted by the city authorities and provided a model for reorganizing other police forces in the state. He was awarded the king's police medal the same year.<br>
<br>Cunningham's firm handling of the salt <i>satyagraha</i> in April 1930 was appreciated by the government of Madras and he was appointed inspector-general with responsibility for the suppression of civil disobedience throughout the province. His actions in April were said to have &#145;fortified the Madras Government at a time when any weakening in the capital would have led to widespread breakdown in law and order up country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Oct 1967). His &#145;authoritarianism&#146; in dispersing meetings was criticized. He was made a companion of the Star of India and awarded the Indian police medal in 1931. In 1933 he was knighted, such an award being rarely conferred on an Indian police officer at the time.<br>
<br>Cunningham's term as inspector-general &#145;represented a high-point in police influence in Madras and brought the IPS [Indian police service] to a position of unprecedented authority within the colonial administration&#146;  (Arnold, 78). In circumstances of growing industrial unrest and rioting his forceful approach reduced the level of violence and enabled the reassertion of authority, but he was much criticized by Congress for incidents where there was undoubted use of excessive force by the police. Cunningham's aim was to protect the life and property of those threatened by the disorder and to demonstrate that disorder was not an effective means of securing concessions; even Congress noted the police's efficiency in quelling unrest. One of his first acts as commissioner was to introduce a new short <i>lathi</i> (stick), which was to prove highly effective because it was easier to wield in large crowds. He was generally quick to defend his officers against accusations of excessive violence, although one officer was later prosecuted for using unnecessary force against a Congress leader in January 1932. Both Cunningham and the government were keen that excessive force should not be used, while recognizing that &#145;once you apply force you cannot always regulate its precise use&#146;  (ibid., 198).<br>
<br>Cunningham also faced the problem of monitoring the more extreme Congress activities, and the small but growing threat from communists, which was soon identified as the main danger. The <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935, which conceded self-government to the provinces, was expected to reduce the demands placed on special branch; Cunningham thought, however, that this was unlikely. He wrote in 1935 that: &#145;far from censoring and press scrutiny work becoming less important under the new constitution, my expectation is that it will become greater in volume and more important than it is now&#146;  (Arnold, 191). After this date he was forced into a delicate political balancing act between upholding the law and ensuring the police's effectiveness, by preventing undue interference by the newly elected provincial authorities, and not allowing special treatment for the police to go so far as to undermine the whole principle of provincial autonomy.<br>
<br>These were difficult years and Cunningham retired relatively early, ending his police career in January 1938. There were some rumours that C. Rajagopalachari, the premier of the first Congress-led ministry of the province, which took office in July 1937, forced Cunningham into early retirement. One version of an early encounter between the two men recounts that on entering the premier's office there was no chair for his use and Cunningham was forced to sit cross-legged on the floor  (Arnold, 219). Rajagopalachari also declined Cunningham's plans for the rapid expansion of special branch, which had been approved by the interim ministry and which were resubmitted by Cunningham in September 1937. It was later proposed that the rumours that he had been dismissed should be countered through the release of a statement thanking him for his outstanding service. This was rejected by Rajagopalachari as an &#145;extraordinary and unnecessary step&#146;  (ibid., 220). Despite his departure and the seeming hostility of the premier little changed in the way in which the police operated; Cunningham's reforms had left a tried and tested force in place. He was disappointed at leaving India &#145;just at a time when the police are going to have an opportunity of demonstrating that they are the servants of the public and the Government of the day&#146;  (ibid.). He maintained his association with India, continuing as deputy and later chairman of the Madras and South Mahratta Railway, serving in these capacities until partition.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain Cunningham became deputy controller of civil defence in Buckinghamshire. In 1940 he was recalled to police work by the Home Office as inspector of constabulary for the southern region, to advise the civil defence regional commissioner on police matters during the war emergency. He also served as vice-chairman of the Committee for the Industrial and Scientific Provision of Housing from 1943 to 1944 and as chairman of the Animal Feeding Stuffs Committee (southern region) from 1945 to 1949. After the war he maintained business interests in the City of London; he became a fellow of the Institute of General Managers in 1958. He was active in pressure groups concerned with fiscal policy and was president of the Taxpayers' Union and a vice-president of both the Free Trade Union and the Cobden Club. He published two volumes of verse inspired by his time in India, <span class="italic">When Sword Met Steel</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">The Shining Sword</span> (1962). He died in London on 30 October 1967; his funeral took place at Golders Green crematorium. His elder son, John Charles Cunningham, died on active service with the RAF in 1941; his younger son, Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Cunningham (<i>b</i>. 1921), was deputy chief of defence staff (operational research) from 1976 to 1978.<br>
