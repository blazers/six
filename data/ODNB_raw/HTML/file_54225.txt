<span class="headword">Hamilton family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1295&#150;1479), <span class="occ">landowners and administrators</span>, is of uncertain origins. A now lost account of the family, supposedly written <i>c</i>.1450 (which in its reported form does not inspire much confidence), claims that the first Hamilton to arrive in Scotland was Sir Gilbert, the eldest son of the earl of Southampton, who fled England <i>c</i>.1308 after being responsible for the death of one of the Despensers, favourites of Edward II. He was much favoured by Robert I on his arrival in Scotland, to the extent that he married Robert's sister's daughter, Isobel Randolph. Later accounts consider that the family's descent was from the earls of Leicester, but concur in the tale of the flight from England. A recent English origin for the family seems most likely.<br>
<br>Although the parentage of <a name="cosubject_54223"></a><span class="headword">Sir Walter fitz Gilbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1346)<span class="occ"></span>, the earliest undoubted ancestor of the Hamiltons, is uncertain, he first appears on 10 January 1295 as a witness to a charter granted by James, fifth steward of Scotland, in the company of other landholders of Renfrewshire. A close relation of Walter, John Fitzgilbert, also had links with the Stewarts, serving Walter, sixth steward of Scotland, as bailie of Bute; the Bannatyne or Bute mazer, an ornamental drinking bowl, is thought to have been made for John soon after Bannockburn. Walter's name (as Wauter fiz Gilbert de Hameldone) is found on the Ragman rolls, a list of those Scottish freeholders recorded as swearing fealty to King Edward I at Berwick on 28 August 1296. He remained loyal to Edward during the wars with Scotland, briefly holding land in Fife from him, and was captain of the garrison of Bothwell Castle, Lanarkshire, until the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. But when the earl of Hereford with a band of English cavalry sought shelter at Bothwell after the battle fitz Gilbert performed a volte-face, imprisoned them, and surrendered the castle and his erstwhile allies to a Scottish force. The ransom later demanded for Hereford included the return of King Robert's wife. In March 1315, as a reward for this, fitz Gilbert received from the king a grant of the lands of Machan in Lanarkshire, forfeited by John Comyn. Later he also had a grant of the barony of Cadzow (now in Hamilton, Lanarkshire), and in July 1323 various lands in Linlithgowshire. Further testimony to his continuing favour is shown by his temporary commission as a justiciary of Lanark in 1321 and by his being knighted by 1323. He may have fought at Halidon Hill (1333), but escaped from the disastrous Scottish defeat. Fitz Gilbert appears to have died by 1346. He married twice. His first spouse was Helen (surname unknown), while his second, whom he had married by March 1315, was Mary Gordon (<i>d</i>. in or after 1323), perhaps the daughter of Sir Adam Gordon of Gordon. They had at least one and possibly two sons.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54224"></a><span class="headword">Sir David fitz Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1375<span class="mult">x</span>8)<span class="occ"></span> was their elder (or perhaps only) son. He was present at the battle of Nevilles Cross (1346), where he was made prisoner. Because of his status he was entrusted to the archbishop of York, with orders that he was not to be delivered up without a mandate from Edward III. He was eventually liberated, apparently for a heavy ransom, and had been knighted by June 1361. In December 1368 he obtained a charter from King David II referring to a grant of the barony of Cadzow made to his father by Robert I, now confirmed with the addition of the lands of Eddlewood. As a baron he attended the parliaments of 27 March 1371 and 4 April 1373, when the succession to the crown was settled on John, earl of Carrick, and his successors. The name of fitz Walter's wife is not certain, though she may have been a daughter of an earl of Ross. He is known certainly to have had two sons, and may have had two others and a daughter. He was alive in November 1375, but had died by October 1378.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54225"></a><span class="headword">David Hamilton of Cadzow</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381<span class="mult">x</span>8)<span class="occ"></span>, fitz Walter's eldest son, was perhaps the first head of the family to employ the Hamilton surname. Little is recorded about him, and he died between October 1381 and November 1388. By October 1378 he had married Janet (<i>fl</i>. 1378&#150;1422), daughter of Sir William Keith of Galston (who remarried after his death). They had a daughter and at least four sons, of whom <a name="cosubject_54226"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Hamilton of Cadzow</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1402?)<span class="occ"></span> was the eldest. He was knighted by November 1388, when he married Jacoba (<i>fl</i>. 1388&#150;1410), daughter of Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith; she survived him and married again. The couple had three sons. Hamilton engaged in raids into England, hence the orders given in 1396 (when he was imprisoned at Norwich for violating the Anglo-Scottish truce) and 1398 that he (and others) should be released from captivity in England. Indeed, it is likely that he was killed at the battle of Hamildon Hill on 14 September 1402.<br>
<br>Hamilton's eldest son was <a name="cosubject_54227"></a><span class="headword">James Hamilton of Cadzow</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1388, <em>d.</em> in or before 1436)<span class="occ"></span>. He was in captivity in Lincolnshire in 1413 (the cause not known), but must have been able to negotiate a release. He served as a hostage (valued at 500 marks) for the ransom demanded for James I after the king's return from England in 1424. He may have gone back to Scotland <i>c</i>.1426, but as there is no further record of him it is also possible that he died while being held in the Tower of London. He was certainly dead by October 1436. He had married Janet (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1395, <i>d</i>. after 1422), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16800/', "Sir Alexander Livingston")</script> of Callendar, by October 1422. She may have been his second wife, but no other is on record, and her death date is unknown. Hamilton had five sons and three daughters; it is not clear which spouse was their mother.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_12078"></a><span class="headword">James Hamilton</span>, first Lord Hamilton  (<em>c.</em>1410&#150;1479)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son, had been knighted by July 1439. Although his family had no known history of direct support for the earls of Douglas, major landowners in Lanarkshire, in 1441 he married Euphemia (<i>b</i>. in or after 1406, <i>d</i>. 1468), daughter of Patrick Graham, earl of Strathearn, and widow of Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1439). (He had previously been affianced to a Janet Maxwell, a marriage perhaps never completed.) This union tied him firmly to the Douglases. His support for them brought further reward. On 3 July 1445 he was one of the first beneficiaries of moves by the greater barons in Scotland to adopt distinct titles: he was granted a hereditary lordship of parliament in a crown charter by which all his lands and baronies were erected into a lordship called Hamilton.<br>
<br>Hamilton evidently continued to associate himself with the Douglases, most notably when he joined the eighth earl in a pilgrimage to Rome in 1450 for the jubilee year; but as the court was dominated by the Livingston interest to mid-1449, and then to 1454 by the Crichtons, he was seldom close to James II. This divided loyalty cast him into the political wilderness after the king killed the eighth earl of Douglas in Stirling in February 1452. In the following month Hamilton was with James, the ninth earl, when the latter ravaged Stirling, and when parliament met in June he and others fixed a letter on the parliament house door renouncing their allegiance to the king. Although an accord between James II and Douglas was reached in August and further sealed in January 1453, the two parties were not fully at ease. Hamilton briefly acted as the king's ambassador, but may have used his ambassadorial duties as the occasion for intrigue with the Yorkists in England.<br>
<br>James II, probably planning a strike against the Douglases in any event, moved swiftly against Douglas and his allies in March 1455. Hamilton had been unable to obtain succour from England and when besieged in Abercorn Castle surrendered after observing that Douglas's courage was fading; he was imprisoned in Roslin Castle. He was not detained long, as the king (no doubt again seeking firm supporters at the climax of the defeat and disgrace of the Douglases) had him released and confirmed him in his tenure of his lands. In addition, he was granted the sheriffdom of Lanarkshire in July 1455 (previously held by the earl of Douglas) and in 1457 some land in Renfrewshire forfeited by the earl. In the following years Hamilton occasionally acted as a witness of crown charters and as ambassador. In 1457 he entered into a bond of manrent with George Douglas, earl of Angus, which obliged him to counsel and support Angus whenever required. The bond demonstrates how Angus's grant of the lordship of Douglas after the forfeiture of the ninth earl had led to his assertion of authority over former Douglas vassals; it also points to Hamilton's status among the nobility.<br>
<br>On the death of James II in 1460 Hamilton briefly became a regular at court, but his star seems to have waned along with that of his uncle James, Lord Livingston (who had played a prominent role in securing his submission to James II in 1455). Hamilton's first wife died between 1 August and 1 November 1468. They had at least a daughter, Elizabeth, who married David, earl of Crawford (created duke of Montrose in 1488).<br>
<br>About 1472 Hamilton began to appear as a witness of crown charters with great regularity. Although no more than a member of the king's daily council, a mark of his enhanced standing at court was his marriage about 1474 to Mary Stewart (1451&#150;1488), the king's sister. She was the former spouse of Thomas Boyd, disgraced earl of Arran (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1474). This significant alliance would secure for Hamilton's descendants an important role at court, on which they fully capitalized, not least because it made successive Hamiltons heirs presumptive to the throne. The couple had at least one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12079/', "James Hamilton, second Lord Hamilton and later earl of Arran")</script>, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Matthew Stewart, earl of Lennox. Mary Stewart is thought to have died in mid-1488. Hamilton died on 6 November 1479 and was probably buried in Hamilton kirk. He also had several illegitimate children, including at least four sons, three of them with one Janet Calderwood.<br>
<br>By the mid-fifteenth century the Hamilton family held significant estates in Lanarkshire and Linlithgowshire, as well as land in Kirkcudbrightshire, Roxburghshire, and Renfrewshire. The first lord obtained the erection of Hamilton as a burgh of barony, possibly by 1465 and certainly by 1474, and began to feu out property there. Like many of his contemporaries, he undertook the erection of a collegiate church (at Hamilton), for which the pope's approval was obtained while he was in Rome in 1450. He also endowed a chapel and hospital in the parish of Shotts, because of its distance from Bothwell parish church. In January 1460 he made a grant of land in Glasgow to that city's newly founded university, on condition that the masters and students offered daily prayers for himself, his family, and even his unrequited benefactors. More unusual interests included reclaiming land from the sea, made at great cost near his lands at Kinneil, Linlithgowshire, and investigations into fining lead, both undertaken by the 1460s.<br>
<br>By 1479 the Hamiltons had certainly found a niche at court, particularly through the marriage with the king's sister. As the second Lord Hamilton was only a few years old when he succeeded, there was no guarantee that his position on attaining his majority would be secure; but when he did, the father's uncertain loyalty before 1455 clearly counted for less than the son's being a cousin of King James IV.<br>
