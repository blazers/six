<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rawlinson,  Richard</span>  (1690&#150;1755), <span class="occ">topographer and bishop of the nonjuring Church of England</span>, was born on 3 January 1690 at his father's house in the Old Bailey, St Sepulchre's, London, eighth of the fifteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23194/', "Sir Thomas Rawlinson (bap. 1647, d. 1708)")</script>, vintner and lord mayor of London, and his wife, Mary Taylor (1661/2&#150;1725). He was educated at St Paul's School, probably from 1697, at Eton College from 1702, and at St John's College, Oxford, whence he matriculated in 1708, graduating BA in 1711 and proceeding MA in 1713. His early interest in topography is demonstrated by his compiling while at Eton a historical account of the places on the road between Eton and London. He early acquired from his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23195/', "Thomas Rawlinson (1681&#150;1725)")</script> an enthusiasm for book collecting and while a student he began to collect editions of the classics, books on English history, topography, and drama. His enthusiasm for antiquarian studies was encouraged at Oxford where he came under the influence of the second generation of Anglo-Saxon scholars and where the collections Anthony Wood had made the previous century for the history of Oxford and Oxford men made a lasting impression. He consulted manuscripts at the Ashmolean Museum from 1710 and at the Bodleian Library from 1711. In the latter year he published a <span class="italic">Life of Anthony Wood</span>, whose interests in topography and biography he was already emulating, travelling out of Oxford as an undergraduate to copy monumental inscriptions in neighbouring parish churches.<br>
<br>After 1711 Rawlinson began to share his brother Thomas's rooms in the Middle Temple, then followed him to Gray's Inn. The young antiquary developed &#145;a gift for editing other men's work and acted as foster-parent to many orphaned books&#146;  (Ward and Waller, 351). Many of the antiquarian books published by Edmund Curll were seen through the press by Rawlinson, among them Tristram Risdon's <span class="italic">Survey of Devon</span> (1714), Elias Ashmole's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Berkshire</span> (1719), John Aubrey's <span class="italic">Natural History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey</span> (1719), and accounts of the cathedrals of Hereford, Worcester, Lichfield, and Rochester all in 1717, and of Salisbury and Bath in 1719. In 1720 there appeared <span class="italic">The English topographer, or, An historical account of all the pieces that have been written relating to the natural history or topographical description of any part of England</span>. Considered by John Nichols as Rawlinson's principal work, it provided the pattern for Richard Gough's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of British Topography</span> (1768 and 1780).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1712 Rawlinson began his extensive journeys throughout England, during which he made antiquarian notes and copied monumental inscriptions. In 1718 he visited, in the company of Edmund Curll, most of the parishes of Oxfordshire, with the intention of compiling a history of the county, which was to include Anthony Wood's history of the city of Oxford. The plan never materialized, but the collections were preserved and, like so many of his antiquarian papers, survive in the Bodleian Library. In 1713 he became a governor of Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals in London and was in 1714 elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Rawlinson was, like his father, a staunch Jacobite and nonjuror. He was ordained deacon and priest in the nonjuring Church of England by Jeremy Collier in 1716, and, though he sought to keep his ordination secret, was active ministering among the nonjurors.<br>
<br>After travelling extensively in England, Rawlinson was keen to go abroad, to study foreign languages, to meet continental scholars, and to add to his collections. As a nonjuror in a church which was becoming increasingly divided over its liturgical practices, he was interested to see for himself foreign liturgical traditions. As a Jacobite he wished above all else to visit the court of James Stuart, the Pretender, at Rome. In 1719 he travelled in France and the Netherlands, and was enrolled as a student at the universities of Utrecht and Leiden. Oxford created him DCL the same year. In 1720 he began his tour of the continent, visiting the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, Sicily, and Malta; he matriculated at Padua University in 1722 and spent many months resident in Rome. He kept a diary of his tour, which survives among his manuscripts in the Bodleian Library (MS Rawlinson D. 1179&#150;87).<br>
<br>Rawlinson decided to return to England on receiving news of the death of his banker, a long-time family friend whose executor he was, and at Genoa he read a newspaper account of the death of his brother Thomas. During Rawlinson's absence abroad Thomas had neglected his estates, accumulated huge debts in the course of adding to his collections of books, manuscripts, and prints, married unwisely, and finally disinherited his siblings by breaking the entail on the family estates and settling an allowance on his widow. It was his brother's unenviable task to reach a settlement with Thomas's widow, to set the management of the estates in order, to sell Thomas's vast collections, and to pay off his creditors. The arrangements for the auctions dominated Rawlinson's life for seven years from 1726, but the proceeds of the sales were much smaller than anticipated, and he was not free of debt until 1748. These financial difficulties forced him to live frugally and prevented him from travelling, from publishing or collecting on the scale he desired, and even from visiting Oxford for many years.<br>
<br>Rawlinson settled in London in 1726, first at his old rooms in Gray's Inn, then from 1734 at the apartments that were formerly his brother's in London House, Aldersgate Street. He was admitted a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1727 and about this time became a freemason. By 1732 he was master of the lodge in Ludgate Street, warden of another, and member of two more. He was grand steward in 1734. He briefly returned to editing and publishing, with a <span class="italic">History of Sir John Perrott</span> (1728) and his own translation of Du Fresnoy, <span class="italic">New Method of Studying History</span> (1728). Both attracted more criticism than praise and thereafter Rawlinson confined himself to the publication of private reprints and facsimiles.<br>
<br>In 1728 Rawlinson was consecrated bishop by bishops Gandy, Doughty, and Blackbourne. With them he signed a declaration against the rituals advocated by Collier, among other &#145;usagers&#146;, and in favour of the continued use of the liturgy of the Church of England. He was party to the negotiations which culminated in the reunion of 1732, but the communion service remained a matter of controversy and the rift in the ranks of the nonjurors was only partially healed. Of lasting significance, however, was Rawlinson's role in preserving the records of the nonjurors, many of whose letters, sermons, and other papers survive in his manuscript collections at the Bodleian. He was tireless in his researches into the history of the nonjurors and sent out biographical questionnaires to all known nonjuring clergy and academics, arranging and binding the returns for safekeeping. Rawlinson's nonjuring and Jacobite loyalties never wavered. They eventually led to his falling out with colleagues in the Royal Society and then the Society of Antiquaries. His interest in antiquities and in early English history was stimulated, as it was in other nonjuring scholars, by his desire to find precedents and tradition to justify their position. The nonjurors' emphasis on the importance of Anglo-Saxon studies probably influenced Rawlinson's endowment of a lecturer or professor in Anglo-Saxon at Oxford.<br>
<br>With the deaths of Thomas Hearne and Thomas Tanner in 1735, Rawlinson regarded the study of antiquity as at a low ebb, but this only increased his own determination to &#145;provide for posterity without regard to this ungrateful age&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ballard 2, fol. 48<i>v</i>) by collecting books, manuscripts, and historical materials. In particular he devoted much of his last twenty years to collecting biographical information about living or recently deceased Oxford men, in continuation of Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>. Thomas Tanner, who had inherited Wood's own collections on Oxford writers of 1500 to 1690, had published a supplementary volume in 1721. Rawlinson preferred merely to collect materials from 1690 to his own day, and to leave them to the Bodleian for a future editor to digest and publish. This project prompted his return to Oxford, made him many friends, and strengthened the ties between him and his &#145;dearest Oxford&#146;.<br>
<br>Rawlinson took as his episcopal motto &#145;I collect and I preserve&#146;, words which accurately reflect his consuming passion, the love of collecting inspired by his conviction that materials must be acquired and preserved for future generations. Before he went abroad in 1719 his collections were small, but in the course of his travels he acquired not only books and manuscripts but also coins, medals, seals, and miscellaneous curiosities. It was a severe disappointment on his return to learn that he was not to inherit his brother Thomas's magnificent library and a bitter task to oversee its dispersal in a series of eleven sales. His meticulous records, compiled to satisfy the scrutiny of his sister-in-law's new husband, John Tabor, provide interesting insights into the mechanics of eighteenth-century book auctions. Prevented by his agreement with Tabor from simply withholding from sale those items which he wished to own, Rawlinson had to match the highest bid at auction. He nevertheless acquired considerable numbers of his brother's books and manuscripts.<br>
<br>Rawlinson's move to London House in 1734 marked the resumption of his collecting, particularly of manuscripts, on a grander scale. He frequented auction rooms and booksellers' premises and bought widely in all periods. His collections include many early charters, several monastic cartularies, hundreds of medieval liturgical, biblical, and classical manuscripts, an important group of medieval Irish manuscripts including the famous &#145;annals of Inisfallen&#146;, a series of some 250 poetical miscellanies mainly of the seventeenth century, over 100 volumes of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literary and scholarly correspondence, and a wide range of manuscripts relating to topography, history and biography, heraldry and genealogy, theology, law, and medicine.<br>
<br>Rawlinson did not confine himself to the traditional means of purchasing manuscripts through auctioneers and booksellers. He vastly increased his collections by seeking papers of historical interest which had been sold for scrap, scouring grocers' and chandlers' shops, and purchasing by weight important seventeenth-century archives. He also developed unrivalled skill in locating papers which had strayed and were thought to have been lost&#151;most notably the state papers of John Thurloe and the Admiralty papers of Samuel Pepys. He systematically sorted all the collections he bought as discarded bundles of loose papers and had them bound into volumes to reduce the risk of their being unwittingly or carelessly thrown away a second time.<br>
<br>Although increasingly convinced that his contemporaries did not value these materials as they ought, Rawlinson was always generous both in lending items from his collection to scholars who expressed an interest in their contents and in presenting them to institutions which could be relied on to preserve them. From the 1730s his gifts of books and portraits to the Bodleian Library became almost an annual event. As the fame of his collections grew, and he never married, speculation about their eventual fate became a matter for public discussion. Rawlinson's own loyalties were divided between the two institutions which seemed still to encourage the study of history and antiquities, the Society of Antiquaries and the University of Oxford, and his first will left part of his collections to each. Humphrey Owen, Bodley's librarian from 1747, was assiduous in his proper acknowledgement of Rawlinson's gifts already received and in offering space in the refurbished picture gallery for some of the bulkier items in his collections. Then the society, having elected him vice-president in 1753, in 1754 removed him from the council on account of his Jacobite loyalties, and Rawlinson revoked his bequest to the antiquaries.<br>
<br>Rawlinson's health was already failing by then and he died on 6 April 1755 at Islington. Following his instructions his body was buried in St Giles' Church in Oxford and his heart in the chapel of St John's College, on 14 April. To the Bodleian, that &#145;sanctuary for use and curiosity&#146; as he described it  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 31, fol. 444), he bequeathed all his manuscripts, charters and seals, and a selection of his printed books. To St John's he bequeathed the bulk of his landed property, some of his books, and his coins and medals. In addition to his earlier endowment of a chair in Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, he made provision for the salary of the keeper of the Ashmolean Museum.<br>
<br>Rawlinson's political and religious views were at odds with the majority of his contemporaries, many of whom judged him only as a stubborn nonjuror and Jacobite. The intensity of the dislike his principles engendered is illustrated in the abusive attack on his character published in the <span class="italic">Evening Advertiser</span> of 19 November 1754, which labelled him a misanthrope, &#145;an opposer of our established religion&#146; and &#145;abuser of the present government&#146;, one who pretended to be an antiquarian &#145;out of sheer hatred to the present generation&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.617&#150;19). Those who shared his enthusiasm for antiquity and his scholarly interest in preserving historical materials for the future acknowledged him as a generous patron who did all in his power to assist scholarly antiquarian enterprises. He was one of the greatest collectors of the eighteenth century and his lasting monument is the vast accumulation of 5000 manuscripts which have furnished material for all manner of historical, theological, and literary studies since they came to rest in the Bodleian in 1756.<br>
