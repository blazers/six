<span class="headword">Somerset, Lord  Charles Henry</span>  (1767&#150;1831), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born at Badminton, Gloucestershire, on 12 December 1767, the second son in the family of nine sons and four daughters of Henry Somerset, fifth duke of Beaufort (1744&#150;1803), and his wife, Elizabeth (1747&#150;1828), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2931/', "Admiral Edward Boscawen")</script>. Among his brothers were the army officers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26007/', "Lord FitzRoy Somerset, first Baron Raglan")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26014/', "Lord (Robert) Edward Henry Somerset")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47305/', "Lord John Thomas Henry Somerset")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26007/', "Somerset, FitzRoy James Henry")</script>].<br>
<br>Educated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Oxford (MA 1786), Somerset became a colonel in the 1st West India regiment (major-general 1798), and attained the rank of a full general in 1814. In June 1788 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1815), daughter of William Courtenay, second Viscount Courtenay; they had three sons and four daughters. His second wife, whom he married on 9 August 1821, was Lady Mary Poulett (<i>d</i>. 1860), daughter of John Poulett, fourth Earl Poulett; they had two daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26013/', "Poulett George Henry Somerset")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26007/', "Somerset, FitzRoy James Henry")</script>] He was appointed gentleman of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales in 1791, represented Scarborough (1796&#150;1802) and Monmouth (1802&#150;13) in the House of Commons, was sworn of the privy council in 1797 and was comptroller (until 1804) of the household, then joint paymaster-general of the forces under the premiership of William Pitt and the third duke of Portland in 1804&#150;13, before accepting the governorship of Cape Colony, where he arrived on 6 April 1814.<br>
<br>Lord Charles Somerset's governorship was marked by important developments on the colony's unsettled eastern frontier, in the administration of affairs related to the transfer from Dutch to British rule, and in political conflict with radical elements on the issue of freedom of speech, and was also distinguished by poor relations with both British and Dutch settlers. In 1815 the authorities put down a rebellion by landless Dutch-speaking colonials and mismanaged the execution of convicted ringleaders&#151;in four of the five hangings, the ropes broke and the proceedings had to be repeated. Somerset tried to placate colonists' feelings by persuading Xhosa chiefs to allow them to follow the spoor of stolen cattle across the frontier and exact compensation. But Chief Ngqika, through whom Somerset worked, did not have power to carry this out, and the incident was long remembered by frontiersmen as a grievance against the British. Somerset then cleared a buffer zone east of the Fish River, but a later decision to allow a military settlement there ensured further conflict. Meanwhile Somerset had sought to stabilize the frontier by establishing British immigrants, the 1820 settlers, on the west bank of the Fish.<br>
<br>Somerset's governmental changes included the legalization of the English language as the official medium, the introduction of British currency, the setting up of a council of advice, and attempts to ameliorate the treatment of slaves in accordance with new policies laid down in London. Doctrinaire Anglicization marked some of these changes, but Somerset's enduring reputation was rather that of an autocrat, as appeared from his conflict with leaders of English-speaking opinion in the colonial community, George Greig, John Fairbairn, and Thomas Pringle, who successfully used the governor's quarrels with two reprobate settlers to demand press freedom. The commissioners of eastern inquiry, who included the Cape in their brief, found little justification for personal criticism of Somerset, though they were critical of the form of government in which the colony's governor exercised the sole authority. A council of advice was appointed in 1825. After overreacting to criticism, in March 1826 Somerset returned to Britain, where his critics kept up pressure on him. He did not return to the Cape, and died in Brighton on 20 February 1831.<br>
