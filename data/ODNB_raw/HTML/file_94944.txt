<span class="headword">Lakshmi Bai <span class="st"> [Lakshmibai]</span></span>, rani of Jhansi  (1827/1828&#150;1858), <span class="occ">warrior queen in India</span>, was born at Benares, India, probably in late 1827 or early 1828, the only child of Moropant Tambe and his wife, Bhagirathi Bai, a woman versed in Hindu mythology. Her father was an employee of Chimanjee Appa, brother of the peshwa, Baji Rao II. She was given the birth name Manikarnika. On Chimanjee's death in 1832 her father joined the service of Baji Rao, who after his surrender to the British in 1818 lived at Bithur, near Cawnpore. When Manikarnika, a small child, lost her mother, Moropant devoted himself to bringing her up. He remarried after Manikarnika's marriage, and had a son and another daughter. The family was Marathi Hindu Brahman.<br>
<br>Manikarnika had no institutional education, but her father gave her training fit for a future queen (on the prediction of an astrologer, so it was said). She learnt Marathi, Hindi, Sanskrit, and Persian, and became proficient in riding, fencing, shooting, and other physical feats usually reserved for men. Handsome, intelligent, possessing a pair of &#145;particularly fine eyes&#146;  (Lang, 94), she was a favourite of Baji Rao, at whose initiative, in 1842, she was married to Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, the childless widowed raja of Jhansi (the overlordship of which had been ceded by the peshwa to the British). Manikarnika became Rani Lakshmi Bai. Her father received employment in the state. <br>
<br>Life was at first difficult for Lakshmi Bai, since Gangadhar was taciturn, and she was confined indoors. Nevertheless she quickly gained her husband's respect and went with him on pilgrimages, when she enjoyed the freedom of outdoor life. In 1851 she gave birth to a son, who died within three months. Gangadhar fell sick, but a day before his death on 21 November 1853 he adopted Damodar Rao, descended from his grandfather, as a son to succeed him. His last request to the British, in a letter personally handed over to the local British official, Major Ellis, was that Lakshmi Bai should be allowed to manage his state as the <i>malika</i> (or regent) until the boy, his successor, grew up. <br>
<br>Lakshmi Bai, after the custom for Hindu widows, took to wearing white, but unlike most she neither shaved her head nor gave up wearing jewellery. She was described as appearing at court wearing loose trousers, a bejewelled cap of bright scarlet silk on her head, a diamond necklace round her neck, and her waist tightly drawn by a gold-embroidered belt sporting two silver-mounted pistols and an elegant hand-dagger. While she competently administered the principality, gave directions, and heard petitions and reports, she spent long hours in the prayer room, and regularly visited the Mahalakshmi temple in great style. This was as much a political as a religious act. People had a glimpse of their rani and knew who ruled. The Brahmans, impressed by her religiosity&#151;and munificence to them&#151;accepted her unconventionality. Her subjects almost worshipped the ground she walked on. <br>
<br>The problem was with the British. Under the Hindu law of inheritance Damodar Rao was heir and successor to Gangadhar Rao. Yet Lord Dalhousie, governor-general of India, decided to annex Jhansi under the doctrine of lapse, a rule that meant that on the failure of natural heirs the dependent states would lapse to the British. Aware of the policy, and before Dalhousie's decision reached her, Lakshmi Bai sent two petitions to him (the originals were partially drafted in Persian by her) seeking sanction of the adoption. She mentioned the loyalty shown by the rulers of Jhansi, the assistance given to the British on many occasions, and their mutual treaties of friendship. Most important, by the treaty with Ramachandra Rao in 1817, the British had agreed to &#145;acknowledge him and his heirs (<i>warison</i>) and successors (<i>janishan</i>)&#146; as &#145;hereditary rulers&#146; of Jhansi. Lakshmi Bai argued that treaties were drafted with care. It was not possible that the term <i>janishan</i>, along with the term <i>warison</i>, with a different meaning, was used &#145;without a precise understanding of its meaning&#146;  (Sinha, 114 and 116). Damodar was accepted as Gangadhar's legitimate successor under Hindu law, and the British should respect the solemnity of a written treaty. Dalhousie's contention, stated in his minute, was that Jhansi was a &#145;dependent principality&#146; held by a chief under &#145;grant from the British Government as sovereign&#146;, and that the &#145;dependent nature of the chiefship &hellip; does not admit of dispute&#146;  (ibid., 19). Under his orders Jhansi was incorporated in the British dominions in March 1854, and Lakshmi Bai, offered a pension, was asked to move to Rani Mahal in the city. Although the rani is believed to have said &#145;I will not surrender my Jhansi&#146;  (Tahmankar, 48), she left the fort, but refusing to accept the decision as final she sent further petitions to Dalhousie arguing for the restoration of Jhansi. &#145;It is notorious, my Lord&#146;, she wrote on 22 April 1854, &#145;that the more powerful a state may be the less disposed it is to acknowledge an error or an act of arbitrary character&#146;  (Lebra-Chapman, 35). Dalhousie did not relent. The rani then appointed John Lang, a British barrister, to help her get the annexation annulled, and on his advice appealed to the court of directors of the East India Company. She asserted that the rulers of Jhansi had an absolute right to its territory, which they had never transferred to the company. Did the &#145;disowning&#146; of adoption confer on the company the &#145;right&#146; to &#145;possess the territory&#146; and &#145;seize the Government&#146; of Jhansi?  (ibid., 37). The arguments were rejected. <br>
<br>Then came the revolt of 1857, known later as the Indian mutiny, or otherwise the First Indian War of Independence. When the army units in the cantonment at Jhansi&#151;soldiers of the 12th native infantry and 14th irregular cavalry&#151;rebelled, the British asked for Lakshmi Bai's assistance, which she extended. The rebels, too, approached her, and she gave them help as well. It is possible that she was playing a double game, and was at heart with the rebels, judging that the time had come to avenge her injury. It is equally possible that she was inclined to help the British, expecting in return the restoration of Jhansi. In June 1857 she wrote to them, saying that she had been forced to assist the rebels, requesting military assistance, and accepting temporary administration of Jhansi on his behalf. Within a very short time she &#145;proved herself a most capable ruler&#146;, throwing &#145;into every act of her government all the energy of a strong and resolute character&#146;  (Kaye and Malleson, 3.126); she established a mint, appointed officers with instructions to maintain order, and defeated invasions from the neighbouring states of Orcha and Datia. However, she had assisted the rebels who had proclaimed her their rani; and her men, including her father, were in league with the rebels, who had unjustly massacred the British men, women, and children who had taken refuge in the fort and had surrendered only on assurance of safe passage. Calcutta was convinced that the rani was an instigator in the revolt and the massacre, and Canning decided that &#145;she must be tried&#146;  (Majumdar, 291). <br>
<br>Probably Lakshmi Bai was pushed into war. She rose to the occasion, returned to the fort, filled it with supplies and ammunition, raised fresh troops, personally supervised their parade, inspired them by her presence and words, inspected the stores, and held meetings with untiring energy. In March 1858 the British army under General Hugh Rose invaded and besieged the city of Jhansi, which was, according to G. W. Forrest, &#145;defended by a garrison of desperate and disciplined men&#146;  (Forrest, 220). The British mortars opened fire; the rani's soldiers, men and women, in return &#145;poured a fearful storm of missiles upon the besiegers&#146;, while the rani made rounds among them with words of courage and inspiration. They &#145;sent down from the walls volleys of musketry, rockets, pots filled with powder, logs of wood, every sort of missile which they could lay hands upon&#146;  (ibid., 208&#150;9). The rani was expecting assistance from the rebel leader Tatia Topi, who, however, was defeated on his way to Jhansi by Rose. On 5 April the British entered Jhansi. From inside the fortress in the besieged town the rani escaped, dressed as a man, with her adopted son strapped to her body, on the night of 4 April.<br>
<br>Lakshmi Bai rode hard all night and reached Kalpi, the headquarters of Tatia Topi and Rao Saheb of the peshwa's family. She asked Rao to give her an army so that she could fight. Rao gave the command of the army instead to Tatia Topi, who was once again severely defeated by Rose at Koonch. The rani with utmost exertions transformed the demoralized troops' &#145;despair to confidence&#146;  (Kaye and Malleson, 5.126), yet the brilliant Rose won again at Kalpi. The rebel leaders then decided to hasten to Gwalior, to appeal to Maharaja Jayaji Rao Sindhia's troops and seize the fort. This plan, strategically important, was attributed by Malleson to Lakshmi Bai, who &#145;possessed the genius&#146; and &#145;the daring &hellip; necessary for the conception of great deeds&#146;  (ibid., 144). When the rebels arrived Sindhia marched against them, but his own troops fraternized with them. Sindhia fled, and the rebel leaders marched into Gwalior in triumph, creating a sensation throughout India. Nana Saheb was proclaimed the peshwa. There ensued jubilant celebrations, while the rani, somewhat ignored, furiously protested against the waste of time and money. Her sense of crisis and urgency proved right. The British appeared almost immediately. During the battle that followed&#151;at Kotah-ki-sarai on 17 June 1858&#151;Lakshmi Bai, now entrusted with the command of the forces, mounted on horseback, and clad in her usual military uniform&#151;a red jacket, trousers, and a white turban&#151;encouraged them throughout the day. When the British hussars charged she boldly faced them, but her troops were dispersed and she was killed&#151;differing versions making it impossible to state exactly how. Her followers, determined that the British must not capture her even dead, hastily burned her body, without a proper funeral. Moropant was hanged after Kalpi. Damodar Rao was pensioned off with a pittance.<br>
<br>Anecdotes and facts intertwine so closely that it is sometimes hard to separate the actual rani from the legend that has grown around her. Young, magnetic, brave, energetic, possessed of great intellect and strong determination, in every sense a leader, Lakshmi Bai, on account of her charisma, and because she proved to be &#145;the bravest and best military leader of the rebels&#146;, as Hugh Rose described her  (Forrest, 282), became an icon of the Indian freedom movement. Subhas Chandra Bose, who founded the Indian National Army to fight against the British during the Second World War, named its women's regiment after her. Whether the stories which revolve around her are true is certainly open to question, and clearly her prime aim was to secure Jhansi for her son. What is remarkable is that at a time when women were hardly seen or spoken of, not to mention being involved in riding or fighting, Lakshmi Bai, a woman from a humble background, attracted widespread respect despite her unconventionality, exhibited great administrative acumen, ventured to enter single-handed into a contest with Dalhousie, and gave heroic leadership in a battle against superior armed forces. Her &#145;great influence over the hearts of her people&#146; (to borrow Malleson's words), and her &#145;force of character, added to a splendid and inspiring courage&#146;  (Kaye and Malleson, 3.126&#150;7), enabled her to offer stiff resistance to the British. When defeated, she courted a soldier's death. The impressive statue in Gwalior with her mounted on a horse, her raised right hand holding a sword, represents how people visualize her. Ballads and folk songs celebrate her prowess, villagers still sing of her valour and virtues, intellectuals produce novels, plays, and films, folk art depicts her valiantly fighting, and legends grow. Often called the Joan of Arc or the Boudicca of India, oftener described as an incarnation of the goddess of power, in public memory she became the most revered heroine in Indian history.<br>
