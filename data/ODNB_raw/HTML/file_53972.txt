<span class="headword">Ganly,  Patrick</span>  (1809&#150;1899), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, on 15 October 1809, the son of Patrick Ganly (<i>c</i>.1783&#150;1865), a bricklayer, and his wife, Ann (<i>c</i>.1779&#150;1855). A Roman Catholic, he probably went to Eugene Finnerty's school in Cork; in 1827 he joined the boundary survey being organized by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11610/', "Richard Griffith (1784&#150;1878)")</script> as an adjunct to the Ordnance Survey. Between 1830 and 1832 he worked as a civilian employee of the Ordnance Survey itself, and in 1833 he rejoined Griffith, this time in the office for the general survey and valuation of rateable property. In 1846&#150;9 he was seconded to the board of works, for famine relief projects, and he may have worked in the United States during 1851&#150;2. By 1853, the probable year of his marriage to Mary Elizabeth 
    (Eliza; <i>c</i>.1828&#150;1894)
  , he was back in the valuation office, and he remained there until he was declared redundant in May 1860.<br>
<br>Within the valuation office Ganly was varyingly described as &#145;valuator&#146; or as &#145;cartographer&#146;. The true nature of his activities there over many years is rendered clear by a series of more than 600 of his letters (three volumes of letters in the Royal Irish Academy and one in private hands) addressed to Griffith and dating from between 1837 and 1847. The letters reveal that throughout the greater part of that period Griffith used Ganly as his geological field factotum. He clearly proved himself to be a painstaking and conscientious field geologist, inured to the problems of year-round fieldwork in an often harsh environment.<br>
<br>Some of the detail on Griffith's pioneering quarter-inch (1:253,440) geological map of Ireland of 1839 is based upon Ganly's studies, and most of the revisions introduced into the map between 1839 and 1855 are the fruit of Ganly's investigations. Similarly, many of the geological papers published by Griffith owed much to Ganly's field activities, but for a variety of reasons Griffith chose not to acknowledge his indebtedness to Ganly.<br>
<br>In 1841 Ganly entered Trinity College, Dublin, as an external student, and he graduated BA in 1849. During 1856 he joined the Geological Society of Dublin, and in a paper read there on 11 June that year he explained his discovery that cross-stratification might be used to indicate whether strata had been inverted. The paper was published in 1857, but its importance was overlooked by the geological world, and his discovery had to be remade some seventy years later.<br>
<br>Of Ganly's life after 1860 little is known, but he seems to have practised as a civil engineer. Ganly's wife died in 1894, and he himself died at 52 Main Street, Donnybrook, Dublin, on 29 October 1899. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery two days later. The grave is unmarked.<br>
