<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Matilda</span>  (1830&#150;1916), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born at 38 Canonbury Place, London, on 4 April 1830, the second of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25236/', "Samuel Sharpe (1799&#150;1881)")</script>, the banker and Egyptologist, and his wife, Sarah Sharpe (1796&#150;1851), Samuel's cousin and an artist of some talent. From her strongly Unitarian, wealthy home in Highgate, Middlesex, Matilda gained a passion for educational and social concerns and a conviction that education was the key to freedom. She was educated at home by her parents in a stimulating milieu with constant visits from eminent scholars and scientists. &#145;Much drawing&#146; with her mother, and classics, biblical Unitarianism, and Egyptology with her father, inspired Matilda with a love of these for life. Astronomy, botany, and electricity were pastimes and Matilda taught herself to sing with a tuning fork. She and her elder sister, Emily (1828&#150;1914), the only surviving members of the family after 1881, were scholars to the end, travelling to Italy when over seventy to improve their accents.<br>
<br>Matilda Sharpe was a gifted painter who exhibited at the Royal Academy (two of her many portraits are in the National Portrait Gallery), but she devoted much of her life to teaching. Beginning at Newington Green Chapel Sunday school she went on to teach painting, Latin, and French to working-class students in night schools and at Harp Alley, Blackfriars, Islington, and Kentish Town day schools, the last three being attached to Unitarian chapels. From the early 1870s until the advent of free schooling she took over the management and expenses of these four day schools so that Latin and French could be taught in them, deeply believing that all children should have access to the best in education both for their own benefit and for that of the nation. She developed methods of teaching Latin by rote in large classes of eighty, including the kindergarten. In 1915 W. A. Holman, attorney-general and premier of New South Wales, Australia, attributed his rise in life and his love of learning to her lessons. Sure that God was known through the good and beautiful, she wanted every child to have the best of books, pictures, music, and drama.<br>
<br>In 1881 Matilda Sharpe was much influenced by the Revd Robert Spears to establish a boarding-school for the daughters of Unitarian ministers and other Unitarians that would provide the best education possible at the lowest possible cost, enabling its pupils to go on to university or any of the professions open to women if they wished. With Spears's help she opened Channing House School on Highgate Hill in January 1885 (and also founded Highgate Unitarian Chapel near the school). Unusual for being designated Unitarian, the school had unsectarian religious teaching, except for special instruction for boarders, and was open to all. Day scholars were also admitted and a kindergarten was later established for boys and girls under eight. The school soon attracted about sixty pupils a year, many of them from other countries, especially Hungary and Ireland. The broad education included all forms of science (astronomy as well) and appropriate domestic subjects, scientifically taught; art was encouraged and shorthand and typing available. Pupils were prepared for the matriculation, intermediate examinations, and external degrees of London University. A good academic standard was quickly established with visiting masters used in the higher classes until there were sufficient qualified women. As in many of the new public high schools for girls, games such as cricket and hockey were fostered and tight-lacing and female frailty discouraged, this helped by the fact that Highgate was one of the healthiest spots in London. In other ways Miss Sharpe was less radical, fearing any contact between her girls and boys or young men, even disliking the amount of &#145;love&#146; in tennis (in which she also forbade the use of the term &#145;deuce&#146;).<br>
<br>Miss Sharpe lavished her money and time on the school and soon took sole responsibility for its management, retaining a deep interest in it even after 1899, when the school was incorporated, and 1903, when it was first inspected by the Board of Education inspectorate. Eccentric, enthusiastic, encouraging, very humorous and kind, she developed a school noted for its homely atmosphere, yet able to become a highly rated, non-sectarian, independent day school which gave middle-class girls every chance to take advantage of new opportunities.<br>
<br>Miss Sharpe published an anthology of poetry, <span class="italic">Old Favourites from the Elder Poets</span>, in 1881 and 1912, in which she included nine women poets, particularly the Unitarian Anna Laetitia Barbauld. She also wrote four idiosyncratic books of proverbs, moral maxims, and poetical comments on modern times, emphasizing her love of learning and travel, her dislike of smoking, alcohol, and fripperies, and her ardent support for education for all, &#145;unselfish&#146; free trade, Liberalism, Asquith's &#145;Great Reform&#146; of 1911, and any government which would &#145;treble tax the rich&#146;. Her favourite, <span class="italic">Never Forget</span> (1915), dedicated to Channing girls and running to thirty-two editions, she gave away to any stranger she thought might appreciate it. Somewhat sentimental in her views on motherhood, nevertheless she wanted greater opportunities for women, including preaching, but there is no mention of the suffrage in her writings, although many pupils became suffragists. Small and entirely indifferent to fashion, she was always &#145;brimming over with some new invention for reforming the world, the parlour grate, or the British army&#146;  (Sharpe, 20). She satisfied a hankering after colour, music, gaiety, and crowds by much travel both abroad and around London, revelling in the use of the public omnibus for her constant visiting of art galleries and refreshment rooms. Matilda Sharpe died peacefully at her home, 32 Highbury Place, London, on 30 April 1916.<br>
