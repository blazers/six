<span class="headword">Bainbridge,  Emerson Muschamp</span>  (1845&#150;1911), <span class="occ">mining engineer and colliery owner</span>, was born on 23 December 1845 in Portland Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, the third son and fourth child in the family of fifteen children (ten of whom survived childhood) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56163/', "Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge (1817&#150;1892)")</script>, founder of the department store Bainbridge &amp; Co. in Newcastle, and his wife, Anne 
    (Annie; 1821&#150;1902)
  , daughter of Thomas Hudson, tanner, of Newcastle. He was the only son not to join the family business. He was educated at Edenfield House, Doncaster, and Wesley College, Sheffield. He served an apprenticeship at the marquess of Londonderry's collieries in co. Durham while studying mathematics and mining engineering at the University of Durham. In 1867 Bainbridge was chosen to report to the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers on the haulage of coal, and in 1869 he was awarded a prize by the Institution of Civil Engineers for a paper on the feasibility of working coal at a depth of 4000 feet. He also won the Hermon prize in 1874 for a paper on the prevention of colliery explosions.<br>
<br>In 1870 Bainbridge was appointed manager of the duke of Norfolk's collieries in Sheffield and Tinsley. On 9 April 1874 he married Elizabeth Jefferson 
    (&#145;Jeffie&#146;; <i>d</i>. 1892)
  , daughter of G. J. Armstrong of Manchester, and sister of his late brother Cuthbert's widow. They had two sons and two daughters, but one son and one daughter died in childhood. Also in 1874 Bainbridge became managing director of the Nunnery Colliery Company Ltd, which belonged to the duke of Norfolk. Additionally he was appointed head of Bainbridge and Seymour, a firm of consulting mining engineers in London which collaborated in plans to build a ship canal to Sheffield. He founded Bolsover colliery, a limited company near Chesterfield mining pits in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, in 1889, and he was a director of several other collieries. He was a member of the royal commission on coal dust in mines in 1891, and a juror at the Brussels exposition in 1897. He was also involved in the development of the railways, and was chairman of the Lancashire, Derbyshire, and East Coast Railway. A Liberal and supporter of home rule, Bainbridge was elected MP for the Gainsborough division of Lincolnshire in 1895, and remained in the House of Commons until his defeat in the 1900 election.<br>
<br>Bainbridge, like his father, was a Methodist, and became chairman of the Federation of Free Churches. He was also a very rich man and devoted a considerable part of his wealth to charitable causes. He built a miners' orphanage in Bolsover in 1894, and established a model village there. At Seaford in Sussex he started a holiday home for factory women, and in Sheffield he founded a home for waifs and strays. He also supported the West London Mission, the YMCA, and the Salvation Army, and established a &#145;Start in Life&#146; fund at the London Polytechnic. Bainbridge was a keen salmon fisherman, and rented a stretch of salmon river in Norway every year. He bought a Scottish estate, Auchnashellach, in Ross-shire, with a 40,000 acre deer forest.<br>
<br>Bainbridge's wife, Jeffie, died in 1892, and on 20 July 1898 he married his daughter's schoolfriend Norah Mossom (<i>b</i>. 1880?), daughter of J. Compton Merryweather of Whitehall Court, London. They had a son and a daughter. They built a villa at Roquebrune, near Menton, on the French riviera, and after Bainbridge's death Norah spent much time there, and with her second husband, Captain George Francis Warre, created a magnificent garden. Bainbridge died of double pneumonia at his London home, 47 Upper Grosvenor Street, on 12 May 1911. He was buried at Brookwood cemetery, Surrey, on 15 May 1911.<br>
