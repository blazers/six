<span class="headword">Bouyer,  (Reynold) Gideon</span>  (1741&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and educational reformer</span>, was born in London on 24 December 1741 and baptized at the Huguenot church in Threadneedle Street, the son of John Baptist Gideon Bouyer (<i>d</i>. 1748), who had been educated for the church in the Netherlands, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1794). After his father's death he was taken in by relatives for school and university education at Leiden, and then spent a period in Lausanne. He matriculated in 1761 at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was elected as a scholar in the following year before migrating to Jesus College two years later. Ordained deacon in 1764, Bouyer served as a curate at Burwell, Cambridgeshire. He interrupted his studies to act as tutor to Robert Bertie, second son of the third duke of Ancaster, who was then at Eton College; both the duke and duchess were courtiers and this period of residence at Eton brought Bouyer close to the family, and may have given him court connections. He returned to Cambridge to graduate LLB in 1769. In the following year he was made perpetual curate at Edenham, Lincolnshire, site of the Bertie seat; he was by then also domestic chaplain to the duke. Ordained priest in 1771, he was presented by Ancaster to the valuable livings of Willoughby-cum-Sloothby and Theddlethorpe St Helen, Lincolnshire, and on the strength of this, on 13 April 1771, he married Elizabeth Ponton (<i>d</i>. 1831), of Little Ponton, Lincolnshire. In Willoughby, Bouyer became in effect a local gentleman&#151;the <span class="italic">Universal British Directory</span> referred to the rectory as one of a small number of neighbourhood &#145;seats&#146;&#151;and he might have passed his life there comfortably enough. However, in 1785, he was recommended by Queen Charlotte to the patronage of Shute Barrington, then bishop of Salisbury; Barrington made him a prebendary of Sarum and when he moved to Durham, also appointed Bouyer there: he was further made a trustee of Lord Crewe's charity. Much was expected of Durham prebends, and for the next decade and more Bouyer spent the winter and spring, and sometimes other intervals too, in Durham or elsewhere in the region (including around Bamburgh Castle, site of Crewe's estates and library). In 1803 he was appointed &#145;official&#146; (the equivalent of archdeacon) for the scattered parishes of the dean and chapter's officialty, a position he retained until his death. From 1805 he served as subdean of the cathedral, and came to base himself entirely in the north-east, leaving his Lincolnshire parishes in the hands of curates&#151;though he resigned his posts there only in 1811. In 1810 he obtained the vicarage of Eglingham, Northumberland, which in 1814 he exchanged for that of Northallerton, north Yorkshire, which lay at the centre of a cluster of officialty parishes. In 1812 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Northumberland, to which position was annexed the rectorship of Howick.<br>
<br>Given that Bouyer would establish himself as a local activist, his pastoral career got off to a slow start: though appointed to his Lincolnshire parishes in 1771, he seems not to have taken up residence in Willoughby until 1775. Thenceforth he conducted services at Willoughby and also acted as a local magistrate for South Lindsey. In 1780&#150;81 he was away, following the early death of his former pupil, Robert Bertie, who had become fourth duke in 1778. The Bertie family regrouped around the fourth duke's sister's new husband, the MP Peter Burrell, and their newly rented home at Gunby Hall, close to Willoughby; Bouyer's life then stabilized. He continued to tap family support thereafter but, now aged forty, embarked on a pattern of public engagement&#151;directed first towards general utility, then church interests more specifically&#151;that lasted until his death.<br>
<br>The first issues to engage Bouyer's attention were the state of the local economy and the costs of maintaining the relief-dependent poor. He contributed to a range of Lincolnshire efforts to promote wool production, the worsted industry, and local employment, first by persuading his fellow magistrates for the Louth and Spilsby division to direct overseers to make relief in general conditional on work, and relief for children on their having mastered knitting (by the age of six) and spinning (by the age of nine). Spinning schools were established at parish expense, with the encouragement of a subscription Society for the Promotion of Industry, led by Bouyer, which ran competitions to reward children's achievements. Bouyer publicized these efforts in a pamphlet of 1784, <span class="italic">An Account &hellip; of the Society for the Promotion of Industry in the Southern District of Lindsey</span>, updated in a second edition in 1786 and expanded three years later. He was also among the promoters of a spinning and weaving factory in Louth, later successfully redeveloped as a carpet factory, and in 1785, with his wife, he promoted a &#145;stuff ball&#146; at Alford, open only to the society's subscribers, at which participants had to wear Lincolnshire woollens. The ball was relocated to Lincoln a few years later and became a fixture on the county calendar until 1938, though the requirement to wear wool was abandoned in 1827.<br>
<br>Bouyer's spinning-school scheme attracted speedy imitation in Rutland and, within a few years, also in Essex. It was praised in Thomas Ruggles's <span class="italic">History of the Poor</span> (1794), and came to the attention of George Rose, William Pitt's senior secretary to the Treasury, then engaged in assembling advisers to help Pitt revise the poor laws. Rose sought Bouyer's comments on a draft bill, whose provisions for the establishment of parochial &#145;schools of industry&#146; drew on the Lindsey experiment.<br>
<br>At this stage Bouyer was above all concerned to promote children's work. He argued that too much time was wasted teaching children to read, when this could easily be done much more quickly, perhaps just on Sundays&#151;though he was keen to see child spinners instructed in the catechism. As a Creweian trustee, he reconfigured a girls' school at Bamburgh Castle in the form of a school of industry. In <span class="italic">An Earnest Address to the Parents, Guardians, or Other Friends of Such Children as Now Take, or Are Intended to Take, the Benefit of the Charity School, for Sixty Poor Girls, as It Has Been Lately Regulated at Bamburgh Castle</span> (1795) he defended the school's new emphasis on work, in preference to fractions; he wrote a report emphasizing its success in employing children for the Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor (no. 37, 1798). In Lincolnshire, however, he encountered parental resistance and at Bamburgh enrolments plummeted&#151;though falling numbers were offset by the admission of poor girls from elsewhere as boarders, on which basis the school continued to operate until the later nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Bouyer's subsequent ventures reflected his growing involvement with church government and politics. The later 1790s saw a sharp rise in tension between the established church and &#145;new&#146; dissent, then being spread by itinerant preachers. Bouyer initiated collective action among the clergy of the Louth and Horncastle divisions of the Lincoln archdeaconry. Their survey of church attendance concluded that less than a third of the adult population attended church, and less than a sixth took communion. They resolved to set examples of religious living, and to try to increase religious commitment among parishioners; they also suggested that laws might be tightened to make it more difficult for &#145;fanatical&#146; itinerants to gain licences. Bouyer forwarded the report to his bishop, George Pretyman, who as Pitt's former tutor had a hotline to government; he sent it on to William Grenville, Pitt's cousin and foreign secretary, who was moved to start work on an &#145;ecclesiastical plan&#146; to reform the church, especially by promoting clerical residence. Bouyer was among those consulted on this plan as it developed. Though it fell by the wayside when Pitt resigned in 1801, it prepared the ground for later church reform measures. Meanwhile the report itself was published, as <span class="italic">Report from the Clergy of a District in the Diocese of Lincoln, Convened for the Purpose of Considering the State of Religion in the Several Parishes in the Said District</span> (1800), and attracted a number of responses, including Joseph Benson's <span class="italic">A Vindication of the People Called Methodists</span> (1800). Bouyer and his clerical colleagues continued their efforts to engage their parishioners with the Church of England, publishing in 1804 <span class="italic">Two Addresses to the Inhabitants of the Several Parishes in the Deanries of Louth-Esk, and Ludburgh, Calcewaith &hellip; One on the Duty of Family Prayer, and the Other on Reading the Holy Scriptures</span>.<br>
<br>In the early nineteenth century educational effort was increasingly inflected by sectarianism, and Bouyer's energies were accordingly reoriented. Support from Durham was credited by contemporaries with helping to turn the tide in favour of the specifically church-oriented educational reformer Andrew Bell, as against the initially more prominent Quaker convert Joseph Lancaster. Barrington led efforts to extend school provision in the diocese, but with strong backing from Bouyer and other prebends, including Thomas Burgess and Robert Gray. On first introducing himself Bouyer had told Bell that he was keen to share with him his own sketches and plans, and he subsequently established Bell's &#145;Madras system&#146; in Durham Blue Coat and Sunday schools, and later in his parishes of Eglingham and Northallerton. Bouyer's appointment as archdeacon in 1812 enabled him to promote this work across Northumberland.<br>
<br>Having established himself as an activist in the cause, Bouyer was drawn into the metropolitan circle dedicated to its promotion. In the wake of Herbert Marsh's famous sermon to the annual meeting of charity schools in St Paul's in 1811, calling for &#145;national education&#146;, he joined a small group including Andrew Bell, the archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton, and the high-churchman and leader of the Hackney Phalanx, Henry Handley Norris. They agreed that Bouyer's charge of that year, <span class="italic">A Comparative View of the Two New Systems of Education for the Infant Poor</span>, should be publicized alongside Marsh's sermon to prepare the ground for the launch of the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church. Warning against non-denominational education, Bouyer argued here that orthodox dissenters and members of the Church of England had a common interest in opposing proposals to educate children in any and every faith. Later he would challenge further metropolitan plans: he argued that the new society should not follow the old metropolitan committee/provincial correspondent model of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), but should assign the provinces a greater role; he sought the prime minister's support for his position. Plans for the society were reconfigured in the light of his and others' protests. Bouyer seems to have been content to accept the marginalization of industry in the new scheme: the society's position was that schools of industry might be affiliated with it (as the Bamburgh Castle school came to be), but that the society would leave to local decision whether or not to combine book learning with hand work.<br>
<br>Bouyer went on to help with the reconfiguration of the SPCK itself. As archdeacon he promoted a drive to establish district committees, initially in Alnwick and Bamburgh, then more generally in his archdeaconry and in north Durham. When he failed to persuade these committees to contribute to a general scheme for parochial libraries, he took responsibility on his own shoulders. Having no children to whom to leave his fortune, he poured about &pound;1400 into purchasing books for every parish in Northumberland, to a total of more than 30,000 volumes.<br>
<br>Bouyer showed loyalty to his family. His mother lived at Willoughby both before her second marriage (to John Chevalier, master of St John's College, Cambridge) and from his death until her own in 1794. Bouyer made his nephews&#151;sons of his sister Perigal&#151;his curates at Willoughby, and secured the preferment of the second surviving son, Charles, to the valuable living of Ellingham, Northumberland, which he held between 1803 and 1854. In later life, as a public figure and wealthy man, he was frequently called upon to support desert of various kinds. Beneficiaries of his efforts included the artist Edmund Hastings and the Polish dwarf J&oacute;zef Boruwlaski.<br>
<br>Bouyer died at Durham on 30 January 1826, and was buried in Durham Cathedral. According to the preacher of his funeral sermon, &#145;simplicity of heart, singleness of object&#146; were his predominant features. His will (of 1821) thanked God for great blessings spiritual and temporal beyond all expectation or desert. The bells of Willoughby rang a dumb peal for a day to mark his passing. He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 August 1831.<br>

<p> Very wealthy. Bouyer apparently expected his wealth at death to be over &pound;30,000, some of that represented by proceeds on a policy held with the Equitable Insurance Company. He directed that his possessions &#151; including goods in his houses in Northallerton and Durham&#151;be converted into cash, from which his legatees, all family members or household servants, might purchase what they desired: will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1710, sig. 360&#150;62<br>
