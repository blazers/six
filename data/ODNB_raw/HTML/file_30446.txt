<span class="headword">Armour,  John Douglas</span>  (1830&#150;1903), <span class="occ">judge in Canada</span>, was born on 4 May 1830, at Cavan, near Peterborough, Ontario, the youngest son of Samuel Armour, Anglican rector of Cavan, and his wife, Margaret Douglas. His father, of Irish origin, graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1806, and emigrated to Upper Canada about 1821; there he taught in a school in York (later Toronto) before ordination in the Church of England. John, after early education at local schools and at Upper Canada College, where he was head boy, entered the University of Toronto as a King's College exhibitioner, and graduated BA in 1850, winning the gold medal in classics.<br>
<br>Armour studied law under his brother Robert Armour and in the office of Chancellor Philip Vankoughnet. Called to the bar in 1853, he practised in Cobourg in partnership with Sidney Smith, afterwards postmaster-general of Canada. On 28 April 1855 he married Eliza, the daughter of Francis Schimerhorn Clench of Cobourg and his wife, Eliza Cory. They had eleven children. Armour was appointed county crown attorney for Northumberland and Durham on 26 March 1858, and clerk of the peace on 2 May 1861; he served on the Cobourg town council for several years. He was elected warden of the counties in 1859&#150;60, the same time he was appointed a senator of the University of Toronto. In 1867 he was named queen's counsel, and in 1871 he became a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada. In 1874 he declined the Liberal nomination for West Northumberland in the House of Commons. He was appointed a puisne judge of the Ontario court of queen's bench in 1877, and was promoted chief justice of the court in 1887. Armour was made commissioner to revise the Ontario statutes in 1896. In July 1900 he became chief justice of Ontario and president of the court of appeal. While he declined a knighthood more than once, in June 1902 he received an honorary LLD from his university. On 21 November 1902 he joined the supreme court of Canada. In May 1902, as one of the &#145;distinguished jurists of repute&#146;, he was chosen by the Canadian government to represent Canada on the international tribunal constituted to decide the Alaska boundary dispute. He died in London on 11 July 1903, while attending the sittings of the tribunal, having participated in only two supreme court terms. He was buried in St Peter's cemetery, Cobourg, Ontario.<br>
<br>Armour's appointment to the supreme court of Canada represented an attempt by the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier to improve the quality of its members. Armour enjoyed an unimpeachable reputation as a jurist and was unencumbered by partisan ties. A tall broad-shouldered man with a commanding presence, he was known on the Ontario bench as a hard-working judge, who in his judgments combined common sense with a knowledge of local society and a recognition of the spirit of the law. He tended to be unimpressed by arguments based on strict technical views of the law, and employed an incisive mind and a sharp wit to cut to the heart of the issues before him. Though his influence on the supreme court was negligible, his appointment to that court strengthened his position on the international tribunal.<br>
