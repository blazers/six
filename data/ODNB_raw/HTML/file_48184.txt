<span class="headword">Shippam,  Alfred Ernest Cooper</span>  (1874&#150;1947), <span class="occ">meat and fish paste manufacturer</span>, was born on 19 May 1874 in East Street, Chichester, Sussex, the seventh child and fifth son in the family of eight sons and three daughters of Charles Shippam (1828&#150;1897), pork butcher, of Chichester, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper (1840&#150;1915). He was educated at Hurstpierpoint College, leaving in 1891 to join the wool-stapling firm Priors, of East Walls, Chichester. In 1899 he married Mary Prior; they had one son and one daughter. Before his engagement Shippam had hoped to move to Australia as Priors' representative, but by 1897 he had left the firm to join five of his brothers in the Shippam family business.<br>
<br>Shippams had been founded in 1786 by Charles Shippam, who opened a grocery business in Westgate, Chichester, which later moved to 48 East Street. His grandson, also Charles (Alfred's father), was established there as a pork butcher and bacon curer by 1851. As the reputation of its &#145;Chichester&#146; sausages grew, Shippams supplied an increasing market, and in 1892 the first factory was built. In the 1890s they began making potted meats and pastes, which were cooked and minced before being put into earthenware jars and covered with melted lard. In 1896 Chichester brand potted meats and pastes were shown at the Royal Agricultural Hall in London, and British troops fighting in the South African War (1899&#150;1902) were supplied with Shippams canned sausages. Charles Shippam died in 1897, and in 1899 five of his six sons who worked in the business formed a partnership, with shares allocated according to age. This changed in 1905 when they placed themselves on an equal basis, each with supervision of a different department: Alfred Shippam was in charge of production. In 1906 Upton Sinclair's <span class="italic">The Jungle</span> exposed the unsanitary conditions in the Chicago stockyards. In the resulting scandal, the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, which had printed extracts, expressed concern about the use by English sausage-makers of American canned meat and encouraged domestic firms to invite its team of medical inspectors into their factories. At Shippams, the inspectors found &#145;an ideally clean and well-managed factory for providing the public with first-class foodstuffs, cleanly and carefully handled throughout all procedures and stages of preparation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 23 June 1906). Thanks to this endorsement, Shippams suffered very little from the general slump in the sale of cooked meats following Sinclair's revelations. In 1905 the company began to sell meat and fish pastes in glass jars with airtight metal lids, a transition which was completed by 1909 and which greatly increased the life of the products. In 1910, for example, Captain Robert Scott took several cases of Shippams potted meats as well as soups and tins of Christmas puddings to the Antarctic. Potted meats and pastes, which provided 40 per cent of sales in 1910, accounted for over 70 per cent by 1914. As the business grew, the range of products and flavours increased, and with the completion of a new factory at East Walls, Chichester, in 1913, the company offered thirteen meat and thirteen fish pastes, as well as other products including galantine of wild boar's head and yachting pies.<br>
<br>In 1913 C. Shippam Ltd replaced the partnership, with the five brothers as managing directors, equal in status but paid according to age. As the older brothers retired, members of the younger generation were brought in, and the board of directors and shareholders continued to be exclusively family members. In 1923 Alfred Shippam took on the role of general manager. He had always been particularly concerned with the well-being of the employees, and they held him in great affection. Shippams was a family business, which prided itself on treating its employees as members of an extended family. A bonus scheme started in 1921, and annual company outings in 1924. In 1927 an employee club house opened; profit sharing was introduced a year later; and a pension plan followed in 1939. Most of the staff spent their whole working lives with the firm, which never made anyone redundant and always found jobs for the children and grandchildren of employees, even if there was no need for extra labour. C. Shippam Ltd survived another scare over food hygiene in 1922, when eight people died from botulism poisoning after eating duck paste sandwiches (not Shippams) on a fishing trip in Loch Maree. Although sales of paste fell, public confidence was restored after a report by the Scottish board of health in 1923, and helped further in 1924 by a visit to the factory by Queen Mary, when she was presented with a miniature paste jar, filled with anchovy paste, for the royal doll's house. Production doubled during the 1920s to over 1,100,000 dozen jars of paste in 1929, but sales fell during the depression. In 1934 Alfred Shippam proposed to the board, which had always resisted advertising, that the firm embark on a national marketing scheme organized through the London Press Exchange. His initiative proved successful and advertisements appeared in newspapers and magazines; in 1938 the firm sponsored <span class="italic">Mrs Celebrity</span>, a series on Radio Normandy.<br>
<br>During the Second World War many of the workforce were called up, and women were first employed in the factory in 1942. Alfred, the last of the original five partners still active in the business, managed the company with the help of his nephew Bassil, and despite the shortage of raw materials, sales of paste grew, and the company survived the war in the same financial condition as before. He continued to attend board meetings until two weeks before his death. In 1947 C. Shippam Ltd received a royal warrant of appointment as suppliers of meat and fish pastes to HM King George VI.<br>
<br>In addition to his business life, Alfred Shippam was a churchwarden of All Saints' Church, Chichester, and an active member of Chichester Cathedral. He served as a JP from 1922 until his death, and was a governor of Hurstpierpoint College from 1933. He died of a coronary thrombosis on 13 April 1947 at his home, 2 Cawley Road, Chichester, and was buried three days later, after a funeral at Chichester Cathedral. The Shippam family lost control of the business in 1974 when C. Shippam Ltd was taken over by an American company, William Underwood of Boston. After changing hands several times, it became part of the Princes Foods Manufacturing Group.<br>
