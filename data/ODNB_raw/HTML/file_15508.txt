<span class="headword">Kiallmark,  George</span>  (1781&#150;1835), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, the son of John Kiallmark, an officer in the Swedish navy, and his wife, Margaret (or Marggrit as it is written in the parish register) Meggitt, a Yorkshire heiress, who lived at Wakefield and was a relation of Sir Joseph Banks. His parents' marriage took place in St Nicholas's Chapel, Lynn, on 4 October 1775. Shortly after George's birth his father, who had run through his property, disappeared and soon died. His widow married her butler, a man named Pottle, and George was adopted by his mother's family. He began his education under the care of a Dr and Mrs Gardiner (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Meggitt). From an early age he enjoyed music, and from 1796 to 1798 he studied with a German music teacher.<br>
<br>For some time after 1798 Kiallmark maintained himself in London by teaching the violin and piano, and took violin lessons from F. H. Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon and Paolo Spagnoletti, and studied composition with Von Esch and J. B. Logier. He held many important posts, was a member of all the principal concert and theatre orchestras, and leader of the music at Sadler's Wells. In 1803 he married Mary Carmichael, a cousin of the countess of Rothes, and settled in Islington. He then gave up performing and devoted himself to teaching the harp, violin, and piano, and to composition, entering into arrangements with Chappell and D'Almaine to supply them annually with a fixed number of compositions. His works for the piano included <span class="italic">Introduction and Variations to &#145;Roy's Wife&#146;</span>, <span class="italic">Introduction to &#145;Last Rose of Summer&#146;</span>, <span class="italic">Variations on &#145;Home, Sweet Home&#146;</span>, and <span class="italic">Les fleurs de printemps</span> in six books. He also wrote a number of songs, among them &#145;Maid of Athens&#146;. Kiallmark died in Islington in March 1835, leaving a large family.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_15508"></a><span class="headword">George Frederick Kiallmark</span>  (1804&#150;1887), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born on 7 November 1804 at Camden Street, Islington. He was educated in Margate and began his musical career at the age of fourteen, helping his father with his teaching. He was later a pupil of Logier and taught his system. At the age of sixteen he went to Rouen and on to Paris to study with P.-J.-G. Zimmermann and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Kalkbrenner. On his return to England in 1825 he became friendly with Clementi, on whose advice he had lessons from Ignaz Moscheles. In 1829 he married Emma Fripp Bryant, the eldest daughter of Dr Bryant of Edgware Road. He gave his first public concert at the King's Theatre in 1832.<br>
<br>When in Paris, Kiallmark became a close friend of Sigismond Thalberg, on whose style he based his own playing. He had a delicate touch, and was a superb performer of the works of Chopin. On hearing him play, Mendelssohn said it was &#145;a fine sketch of what piano playing should be, and what he will one day make it&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1842 Kiallmark opened an academy for the study of the piano at his home, 29 Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road. During his life he was associated with every great pianist, from Clementi to Rubinstein, and at the age of seventy-eight he studied the sonatas of Niels Gade and Rubinstein. At eighty he was still daily practising Clementi's <span class="italic">Gradus</span>. He died on 13 December 1887 at 5 Pembridge Gardens, Bayswater, London, only a week after playing one of Thalberg's transcriptions with much of his old fire and brilliancy. He was a fine extempore player, but his compositions have not survived.<br>
