<span class="headword">Manning,  William</span>  (1630<span class="mult">x</span>33&#150;1711), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Cockfield, Suffolk, the son of William Manning. He was educated at Stowmarket School before being admitted on 25 October 1649 as a sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge, where the Platonist Henry More was his tutor. (There is a discrepancy as to his date of birth based on his recorded age at admission, sixteen, and that derived from his reported age at death of eighty-one.) Manning graduated BA in 1653 and proceeded MA in 1660. Like his brothers John (<i>d</i>. 1694), vicar of Sibton-with-Peasenhall and pastor to Independent congregations at successively Walpole and Sibton, and Samuel, rector of Cookley-with-Walpole, William became a clergyman in Suffolk. In 1652 he married Priscilla (1629/30&#150;1710). In 1654 he was chaplain at Landguard fort. By 1658 he was rector of Middleton, where on 29 December he baptized his son, also William. All three Manning brothers were ejected at the Restoration; William's signature appears for the last time in the Middleton parish register in April 1661, the month in which his daughter Elizabeth was baptized there. Manning settled at Peasenhall, and in 1672 he took out a licence under the declaration of indulgence as &#145;a congregational teacher in his own house&#146;, as did his brother John who continued to live in the same parish after his ejection. In 1674 William was fined &pound;20 for keeping a conventicle.<br>
<br>In 1686 Manning published a small volume of sermons entitled <span class="italic">Catholic Religion &hellip; Discovered in some Discourses upon Act X</span>, in which he exhibited a tolerant and truly Christian spirit. He preached occasionally at Lowestoft, Suffolk, and there became acquainted with Thomas Emlyn, who in 1689 was chaplain at Rose Hall to Sir Robert Rich, a member of the presbyterian congregation at Lowestoft. The two friends read William Sherlock's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Trinity</span> (1690), but found it too much like a form of tritheism. Both men were led in consequence to doubt the doctrine and Manning became convinced of the Socinian attitude towards Christ, namely a denial of the essential deity and a full acceptance of the humanity of Christ. In letters to Emlyn, who in 1691 moved to Dublin, Manning argued strongly for this position up to the time of his death. Indeed he tried hard to convert others to this view, but not always successfully. His chief opponent was Nathaniel Parkhurst, a vicar of Yoxford, Suffolk. Increasing deafness led Manning to give up preaching (before 1704), but he retained an active mind and took great interest in current developments of theological opinion. Among the ejected he appears to have been the sole example of a Socinian preacher, and Edmund Calamy, while recognizing that Manning was &#145;a man of great abilities and learning&#146;, curtly noted, &#145;But he fell into the Socinian Principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 337). Manning died on 13 February 1711 and was buried at Peasenhall on 15 February. In his will he left money for the poor of Peasenhall and also &#145;for the schooling of their children&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
