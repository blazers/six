<span class="headword">Hill,  Aaron</span>  (1685&#150;1750), <span class="occ">writer and entrepreneur</span>, was born on 10 February 1685 in Beaufort Buildings, the Strand, the eldest son of George Hill, an attorney of Whitchurch Manor, Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Declining family fortunes forced George Hill to sell his estate in 1707. Ann Gregory, Aaron's maternal grandmother, took charge of his education, sending him first to the free grammar school at Barnstaple (where he befriended the writer John Gay), then to Westminster School (<i>c</i>.1696&#150;1699), and finally supporting him in an ambitious trip to the East (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1704) to visit his distant relative Lord Paget, English ambassador to Constantinople. Hill's early adventures abroad furnished material for the lavishly illustrated subscription volume <span class="italic">A Full and Just Account of the Present State of the Ottoman Empire</span> (1709). Hill returned to Britain with Paget in April 1703, then tutored William Wentworth of Bretton Hall, Yorkshire, until Wentworth succeeded to the baronetcy in 1706.<br>
<br>Between 1707 and 1710 Hill acted as secretary to the maverick earl of Peterborough after defending his actions in his heroic poem <span class="italic">Camillus</span> (1707). Hill declined to follow Peterborough abroad, having, in 1710, married Margaret Morris (1694&#150;1731), daughter of Edmund Morris, a successful grocer from Stratford, east London. The marriage proved happy: four of their nine children reached adulthood, and Hill was especially proud of the literary accomplishments of his three daughters, aptly named Urania, Astrea, and Minerva. Margaret Morris's dowry of &pound;800 enabled Hill to relinquish his journalistic hack work for the <span class="italic">British Apollo</span> (a question and answer paper modelled on Dunton's <span class="italic">Athenian Mercury</span>, on which Gay had assisted him) to embark on a career as a theatre impresario. His period as stage manager at the troubled Theatre Royal in Drury Lane between 23 November and June 1710 ended when an actors' revolt got the better of his youth and inexperience. Later in that year he became director of opera at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, achieving lasting fame for commissioning and writing the libretto for Handel's first opera for the English stage, <span class="italic">Rinaldo</span>, staged on 24 June 1711. His early tragedy <span class="italic">Elfrid</span> (premi&egrave;red on 3 January 1710) met with an indifferent response not improved by its revision in 1731 as <span class="italic">Athelwold</span>. However, Hill's farce which accompanied <span class="italic">Elfrid</span>, <span class="italic">The Walking Statue</span>, quickly entered eighteenth-century repertory.<br>
<br>Hill's entrepreneurial energies found expression in a number of commercial ventures, the first of many he pursued during an exceptionally active life. In 1713 he took out a patent for the process of extracting oil from beechnuts and by 1716 had attracted over &pound;12,000 from investors, but a succession of poor harvests between 1714 and 1716 ended the project. His subsequent project, the manufacture of chinaware in England, anticipated the industrial developments of Josiah Wedgwood. Another cherished plan which Hill failed to fulfil was the colonization of agricultural land in southern Carolina. Hill admired men of action as much as men of letters, as evident in his eulogistic poem to Peter the Great, <span class="italic">The Northern Star</span> (1718). Meanwhile he continued to write for the stage, his second tragedy, <span class="italic">The Fatal Vision, or, The Fall of Siam</span>, opening at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 7 February 1716. His third and best tragedy, the one-act <span class="italic">The Fatal Extravagance</span> (21 April 1721) dramatized a topical theme&#151;ruin caused by South Sea Bubble investments. Hill permitted the play to appear under the name of his impecunious friend the Scottish poet Joseph Mitchell, signal evidence of his emerging role as a patron and friend of other writers. This play's success, coupled with the relaxing of the theatre monopolies and the growth of the unlicensed stage, encouraged Hill to attempt a return to stage management. In 1721 he launched plans for a new resident English theatre company at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket but negotiations for this broke down late in the day. His adaptation of <span class="italic">King Henry the Fifth</span> on 5 December 1723, with a cast that included Barton Booth, Robert Wilks, and Anne Oldfield, met with moderate success.<br>
<br>Hill's most significant role during the 1720s was as patron and promoter of other writers. Between 1720 and 1728 he was perhaps the most important, certainly the most ubiquitous, man of letters in London literary life. His house at Petty France formed the backdrop for his friendship with many writers, members of the so-called &#145;Hillarian&#146; circle (after the name Hillarius bestowed on Hill by his fervid admirer the writer Eliza Haywood). Other members of this circle were Edward Young, Richard Savage, John Dyer, Benjamin Victor, the Scottish poets Joseph Mitchell, David Mallet, James Thomson, and the poet Martha Fowke Sansom, whose autobiographical <span class="italic">Clio</span> (posthumously published in 1752) proclaimed a passionate and intense attachment to Hill. Hill's magnetic good looks (he was tall, dark-haired, and with striking blue eyes) made him the object of much female adulation. Hill helped Richard Savage promote his attempts to claim aristocratic legitimacy, publishing on his behalf <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems and Translations</span> (1726). Over a third of its ninety-two poems are by Hill, others by members of the Hillarian circle, documenting that group's intimate friendships. An ancillary venture was the <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span> (1724&#150;5), a journal inspired by Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Tatler</span> which Hill co-edited with William Bond. This too promoted and encouraged the writings of Hill's acquaintances, with particular prominence given to religious sublime poetry. Essays by the critic John Dennis supported Hill's own enthusiasm for sublime biblical verse, first evidenced in his <span class="italic">The Creation</span> (1720) and in his epic <span class="italic">Gideon</span>, parts of which were printed in the <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span> and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span>.<br>
<br>By 1728 the Hillarian circle had begun to disperse and Hill turned once again to economic projects, his most ambitious yet, a plan funded by the York Buildings company to harvest Scottish pines on Speyside for use as mainmasts on British naval ships. Hill personally supervised the enterprise for several months during the spring of 1728, but it ultimately proved economically unsound, and by 1732 had accumulated a debit of nearly &pound;7000. Scotland profited considerably from the company's extensive investment in the local infrastructures, but this was no consolation to shareholders.<br>
<br>During his absence from London, Hill achieved the dubious fame of seeing his initials featured in both Pope's <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> and <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> of 1728 as a &#145;flying fish&#146; and a mud-diving writer, a sly dig at Hill's inability to sustain the sublime style. The relationship between Hill and Pope was uneven, fuelled in part by Hill's envy of Pope's success and grudging admiration of his talents. He took Pope to task in a lengthy correspondence in which he maintained his dignity while Pope resorted to subterfuges denying that Hill was the intended victim of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>. Hill genuinely regretted Pope's incursion into &#145;low&#146; satire: his <span class="italic">The Progress of Wit: a Caveat, for the Use of an Eminent Writer</span> (1730) turned the allegorical topography of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> against its own author, dramatizing Pope disappearing down the vortex of oblivion with his low subject matter.<br>
<br>Hill cared deeply about many of the issues that had motivated <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>&#151;namely, the decline in national cultural standards&#151;but sought a different mode of redress. During the 1730s he lobbied Walpole's administration (notably in his 1731 <span class="italic">Advice to the Poets</span>) and members of the royal family, especially Prince Frederick in his 1737 <span class="italic">Tears of the Muses</span>, for public support for the arts, particularly the foundation of a national theatre and a dramatic academy. During the early 1730s he once again attempted to buy into the management of the Drury Lane theatre but proved unable to raise the capital. He took an active role from the sidelines, however, personally coaching actors, writing pamphlets addressing the state of the English stage (the anonymous <span class="italic">See and Seem Blind</span>, 1732) and launching <span class="italic">The Prompter</span>, which he co-edited with William Popple between 12 November 1734 and 2 July 1736, a journal which dedicated almost half its numbers to the state of the London stage. It was here that Hill formulated his theory of acting, espousing a more naturalistic mode than the rhetorical style favoured by traditional actors. His ideas were formalized in a poem called <span class="italic">The Art of Acting</span> (1746), a prose version, the <span class="italic">Essay on the Art of Acting</span>, being published in his posthumous works of 1753. Meanwhile Hill achieved his greatest success on the stage with his adaptation of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Zaire</span>. As <span class="italic">Zara</span> this first appeared during an amateur production for the benefit of the ailing William Bond at York Buildings in 1735, before being finally presented to great acclaim at the Drury Lane theatre on 12 January 1736. Voltaire's approval prompted Hill to adapt another of his plays, <span class="italic">Alzira</span>, a work with a similarly exotic setting, first staged at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 18 June 1736. Hill fell out with Voltaire in disagreement over his interpretation of the character of Brutus. His own dramatic version of the story, <span class="italic">Caesar</span>, failed to get accepted for performance, but in 1738 he published an essay on the subject, <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Merit of Assassination</span>.<br>
<br>By the spring of 1737 the financial difficulties which faced Hill had become insurmountable. After several months spent in &#145;solitary rambles&#146; around Britain, by August 1738 he had &#145;sold the best part of a too little <i>fortune</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.111) and moved himself and his family from the house in Petty France to the rural London suburb of Plaistow. Although assailed by domestic problems (his errant son Julius Caesar, his feckless brother Gilbert, his daughter Urania's hasty marriage to the actor Warren Johnson, a nephew's suicide), he responded to his enforced &#145;retirement&#146; with a flurry of activity. During his twelve years at Plaistow he planted over 100,000 French vines in hopes of creating an English wine industry and launched plans for the manufacture of potash, as well as publishing <span class="italic">The Fanciad</span> (a work designed to promote a biography of the duke of Marlborough, 1743), <span class="italic">The Impartial</span>, his &#145;free thoughts on the situation of our public affairs anno 1744&#146;, <span class="italic">Free Thoughts upon Faith</span> (1746), an adaptation of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Merope</span> (finished 1745, first staged in 1749), and three books of <span class="italic">Gideon, or, The Patriot</span> (1749).<br>
<br>Throughout the time at Plaistow (a place his friend the printer and novelist Samuel Richardson described as &#145;that terrible marsh-pit&#146;) Hill and his family suffered persistent poor health, but attempts to leave were thwarted by a long-standing lawsuit that was unresolved in Hill's own lifetime. The activities of these years are documented in his correspondence with Richardson  (V&amp;A, Forster MSS, fol. 13.2). Richardson and Hill enjoyed a close, even affectionate friendship. Richardson had printed both the <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span> and <span class="italic">The Prompter</span> and went on to print all of Hill's works of the 1740s. On 8 December 1740 he sent Hill two volumes of the anonymously published <span class="italic">Pamela</span> to amuse his daughters. Hill soon guessed the author's identity and his eulogistic letters to Richardson supplemented the original preface and dedications when <span class="italic">Pamela</span> went into a second edition on 14 February 1741. Hill and his daughters were also among those readers to whom Richardson sent drafts of <span class="italic">Clarissa</span> for commentary. Richardson, anxious about the work's length, pleaded with Hill for suggestions for cuts. Hill responded with an abridged version (rejected by Richardson) which cut the novel's length by two thirds but introduced an obtrusive didacticism alien to Richardson's literary sensibility. Despite this difference of opinion, Richardson remained friends with Hill and maintained his correspondence with Urania for many years after Hill's death.<br>
<br>Hill was seriously ill for much of 1749 and died at his home, Hyde House in Plaistow, on 8 February 1750, the day before a benefit performance of <span class="italic">Merope</span> commanded by the prince of Wales. He was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife. Many of Hill's poems and letters saw publication for the first time in a posthumous four-volume edition for the benefit of his family, <span class="italic">The Works of the Late Aaron Hill</span> (1753, second edn, 1754). His plays and love letters appeared in the two-volume <span class="italic">Dramatic Works</span> (1760).<br>
<br>Nineteenth-century critics uniformly disparaged Hill's writings and personality. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> saw him as &#145;absurd and a bore of the first water&#146;, an assessment only partially rectified by Brewster's biography (1913). Recent cultural historians have accorded Hill a far more interesting and pivotal role as a pioneer of developments in stage scenery and drama, as a theorist of the Longinian sublime, and particularly for his unceasing activities on behalf of writers of very different political persuasions and literary gifts. He was, in one critic's words, &#145;the cultural glue that holds this literary period together&#146;  (Hammond, 287).<br>
