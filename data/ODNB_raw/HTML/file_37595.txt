</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jardine,  William</span>  (1784&#150;1843), <span class="occ">physician and merchant</span>, was born on 24 February 1784 at Broadholm, a farm near Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, the third son and the sixth of seven children of Andrew Jardine, farmer, and Elizabeth Johnstone. Educated in medicine at the University of Edinburgh, he obtained a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, in March 1802.<br>
<br>In that same month Jardine secured a position with the East India Company as ship's surgeon's mate aboard the <i>Brunswick</i>, bound for India. Captured by the French and shipwrecked in 1805, Jardine was repatriated that autumn and returned to the East India Company's service as ship's surgeon. &#145;Privilege tonnage&#146;, a benefit accorded ships' officers, allowed him a measure of cargo space for private trade. When profits from such trade far surpassed his wages as ship's surgeon, his career interests shifted.<br>
<br>Returning from Canton (Guangzhou) in May 1817, Jardine gave up medicine for commerce, which he learned from Thomas Weeding, a London merchant and East India Company agent. He sailed for Bombay in 1818, and in succeeding years travelled between Bombay and Canton, as supercargo on the <i>Sarah</i>, of which he was co-owner. At Bombay in 1820, he met a fellow Scot, James Matheson, who was speculating in the opium trade. In time their names would identify the biggest British trading concern in the Far East.<br>
<br>From 1820 until 1839 Jardine was resident in China. At Canton his early success, as commercial agent for opium merchants in India, led to his admission in 1825 as a full partner of Magniac &amp; Co., and by 1826 he was controlling that firm's Canton operations. Shortly thereafter, Matheson joined him, and in 1832 Magniac &amp; Co. was reconstituted as Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.<br>
<br>At Canton, foreign merchants were required to conduct business only through the small group of commercial intermediaries known as the Hong merchants. However, by 1834 Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., known as &#145;the Princely Hong&#146;, was regularly operating beyond the traditional British trade with the Hong merchants of Canton, speculating in smuggled opium and piece goods. Their own fleet of ships, flying the company flag of a white diagonal cross on a blue field (Scotland's cross of St Andrew with colours reversed), were the fastest ocean-going vessels in the Far East.<br>
<br>By the mid-1830s, William Jardine was the most influential British figure at Canton and was already a celebrated name in the commercial world of London. Yet he was by then past fifty and anxious to retire from China. However, his return to England was delayed for several years because of his worries about the unstable debt situation among the Hong merchants, as he felt obliged to keep close watch on the safety of his firm's assets.<br>
<br>Peking ordered the opium importers to be expelled in 1836, but Jardine refused to leave. The pressure intensified and opium sales were at a standstill by 1838 when Lin Zexu was appointed imperial commissioner in Canton. Shortly before Lin's arrival, Jardine retired from Canton, in January 1839, intending a leisurely trip home via Bombay and Suez. But startling news awaited him at Naples. Lin had confiscated 20,000 cases of British-owned opium, worth &pound;2 million. Jardine hastened to London, arriving early in September, and immediately prepared to press the foreign secretary, Palmerston, for a forceful response to Lin's actions.<br>
<br>Jardine's consultations with Palmerston began late that month and extended into 1840. He advised a military and naval action involving seizure of one or more Chinese islands for British commerce. Then a negotiation could be conducted along the lines &#145;You take my opium&#151;I take your Islands in return&#151;we are therefore Quits,&#151;&amp; thenceforth if you please let us live in friendly Communion and good fellowship&#146;  (Jardine to Palmerston, 5 Dec 1839, Broadlands Papers, MM/CH/5). Palmerston's subsequent policy adhered closely to Jardine's advice. The British expeditionary force seized Hong Kong in 1841, and the Chinese ports opened to British commerce by the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) (1842) corresponded generally to Jardine's recommendations.<br>
<br>During the period of the First Opium War (1839&#150;42), Jardine joined the London banking firm of Magniac, Smith &amp; Co. (renamed Magniac Jardine in 1841), which handled London affairs for British merchants in Asia; and he successfully stood for election to parliament as the whig candidate for Ashburton, Devon, a town with interests in the woollen export trade to China. In the Commons he seldom spoke, but in 1842, after the treaty of Nanking had secured Hong Kong and opened five new &#145;treaty ports&#146;, Palmerston, acknowledging Jardine's counsel, credited him with a major role in the success of British policy towards China.<br>
<br>Jardine embodied a complex amalgam of shrewd political judgement, raw business &#145;savvy&#146;, and philanthropic inclinations (he contributed to the Morrison Education Society for free education in Chinese and English for Chinese youths, and he provided money for medical treatment for poor Chinese). Among the Chinese he was known as the &#145;Iron-Headed Rat&#146;, referring to an incident at Canton when he was struck on the head by a club and shrugged off the attack. His stern personality and disdain for idleness were reflected in his practice of keeping only one chair in his office, on which he sat while visitors stood.<br>
<br>Jardine was an advocate of free trade, as the East India Company monopoly was expiring; yet he was willing to collaborate with his major rival, Lancelot Dent, to reduce the growing number of vessels competing in the opium trade along the coast. In 1835 he wrote to one of his ship captains, who was selling opium to coastal smugglers: &#145;If you could manage matters so as to make the Mandarins attack every one but your own party it would have good effect.&#146;  (Jardine to Capt. J. Rees, 9 March 1935, private letterbook, C4/4, Jardine Matheson Archive, Cambridge).<br>
<br>Jardine saw opium as the only source of ready Chinese currency, with which to trade in silk, tea, and other items. In 1830 he described the opium trade as &#145;the safest and most gentlemanlike speculation I am aware of&#146;  (Jardine to R. Rolfe, 6 April 1830, private letterbook, C4/1, Jardine Matheson Archive, Cambridge); and he later argued that it was Chinese buyers, rather than British merchants, who were doing the smuggling. He told a parliamentary committee in 1840 that once the money was received and the Chinese buyer got his opium from the ships offshore, then it was the buyer's business what became of the opium.<br>
<br>Jardine never married. However, his private correspondence suggests that he had once had a liaison with a Mrs Ratcliffe, who lived in Kent, and that a young woman named Matilda Jane Ratcliffe, who was provided for in his estate, may have been their daughter. Upon returning to London he joined the Oriental Club and resided at Upper Belgrave Street.<br>
<br>In 1841 he purchased the estate of Lanrick in Perthshire. This property and his shares in the London and Hong Kong firms were bequeathed to his nephews. He died in Upper Belgrave Street, London, on 27 February 1843, following a prolonged, painful illness resulting from a tumour, which necessitated his confinement to a water bed in the final months of his life. He was buried on 14 April 1843 in the churchyard at Lochmaben, where his grave is marked by a tall obelisk, rivalling in size the statue of Robert the Bruce in the town centre, about a hundred yards away.<br>
