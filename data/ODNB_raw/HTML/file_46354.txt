<span class="headword">Friederichs,  Hulda</span>  (1856/7&#150;1927), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born in Ronsdorf, Prussia, and educated in Ronsdorf and Cologne. Having moved to London as a young woman, she was living in 1881, when she was twenty-four, at Monterey, St Mary's Road, Wimbledon Park. From that address she studied English literature under an extension scheme run by the University of St Andrews to help open up higher education for women, and in 1883 passed the first part of its higher certificate.<br>
<br>Hulda Friederichs spent her working life as a journalist on London newspapers. In the nineteenth century journalism became a fashionable literary pursuit for women, although much of the work was freelance, and few could earn a living wage. By the 1890s significant numbers were contributing to the daily and weekly papers, albeit confined to the lighter sections. They were less evident in the mainstream press and on the news desks. Hulda Friederichs began her career on the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in 1883 and served under the editorship of W. T. Stead, whose flamboyant eye and personality made the paper a leading example of the new journalism. Stead was sympathetic to the cause of women's rights, and promoted their interests and talents. Hulda Friederichs was marked out as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, and given opportunities which enabled her to establish a reputation as a serious journalist. Unusually for the time, she was employed on the same terms and conditions as male reporters. She specialized in serious women's issues&#151;uncommon in daily papers in this period&#151;and the kind of reporting that characterized the new age of social realism. A series on women and work included a vivid, firsthand account of the &#145;lasses&#146; of the Salvation Army; the investigative research on which this piece was based became the genesis for her later study <span class="italic">The Romance of the Salvation Army</span> (1907).<br>
<br>Not all Hulda Friederichs's colleagues approved of her success, or of her close proximity to Stead when he made her his private secretary. Stead acknowledged his affection for her and worried about the possible jealousy of his wife, but it seems unlikely that there was ever anything intimate between them. She seemed to gravitate to men of stature and to win their confidence. A friendship with Gladstone's daughter and visits to Hawarden led to <span class="italic">Mr. Gladstone: in the Evening of his Days</span> (1896), a study of his retirement, while her professional relationship with the publisher Sir George Newnes brought invitations to Wildcroft, the family home, and material for a biography (1911).<br>
<br>To her less admiring colleagues on the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, such as Robertson Scott, Hulda Friederichs was &#145;the Friederichs&#146; and &#145;the Prussian Governess&#146;, and Robertson Scott's waspish comments about her suggest something of the difficulties of being a woman in a man's world. She remembered her time rather differently; she recalled the heady days of the new London journalism and the sense of comradeship and enthusiasm: &#145;We were all young together, the whole of the editorial staff, and one and all worked for it not merely as a matter of duty, but because the paper was our pride and glory&#146;  (Friederichs, 220). The sudden sale of the paper in 1892, when E. T. Cook was editor, was a great shock to them; it was bought by W. W. Astor and became a tory organ. Along with other members of the editorial staff, Hulda Friederichs transferred to the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, an evening penny paper which was started by Cook and Sir George Newnes. It continued the <span class="italic">Pall Mall</span>'s tradition of radical Liberalism, becoming a highly influential paper in political circles. Its stable of writers, including Friederichs, were greatly concerned with issues of social reform, and by the Edwardian years were helping to shape the climate of new Liberalism.<br>
<br>At Newnes's request Hulda Friederichs subsequently edited the <span class="italic">Westminster Budget</span>, an illustrated weekly digest aimed at the family market, from 1896 to 1905, and then worked on the <span class="italic">Saturday Westminster</span> as deputy to J. A. Spender. The editorship of the <span class="italic">Budget</span> was a landmark appointment, not least because it offered a woman the opportunity to put her political stamp on a mainstream paper. An additional duty, on behalf of her employer, was to administer the annual Christmas fund, dispensing money to children and the aged poor for pensions and Christmas parties, and supporting various worthy projects such as a medical mission and a convalescent home. In 1903 a day nursery at Rotherhithe in London's docklands was established, partly financed by the fund and by Lady Newnes. Some of this money was dispensed through the Salvation Army, with Hulda visiting the recipients in the poorer parts of London&#151;a throwback, perhaps, to her days as a reporter, but also providing material for her writing.<br>
<br>Hulda Friederichs's other publications show that she was multilingual. She translated poems from Russian, Swedish, Spanish, and French into English and German, and translated Rudolf Martin's <span class="italic">The Future of Russia</span> (1906). She never married, and died on 12 February 1927, at her home, 2 Norfolk Mansions, Santos Road, Wandsworth, London.<br>
