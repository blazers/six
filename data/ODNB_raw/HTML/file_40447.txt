<span class="headword">Adrian,  Max</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Max Bor]</span>  (1903&#150;1973), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 1 November 1903 in northern Ireland, the son of Edward Norman Cavendish Bor and his wife, Mabel Lloyd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thornton. He was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, renowned for its teaching of English, whose past pupils included Samuel Beckett. Adrian described himself as being &#145;one third Irish, one third English and one third German&#146;, whose supposed national attributes he considered were reflected in his acting. He had an Irish love of words and an English restraint, often combined with a penchant for the sardonic <i>double entendres</i> of a nightclub comp&egrave;re from the Weimar republic. Despite this distinctive style, he was a versatile and accomplished actor, equally at home in classical drama, intimate revue, and the theatre of the absurd. He also appeared with distinction in films, television, and one-man shows.<br>
<br>Adrian began his stage career as a chorus boy on the lowest rung of the theatrical business, performing in a chorus line while the reels were being changed at a silent moving-picture house. He graduated to the Gaiety Theatre at Douglas in the Isle of Man, before touring in George Gershwin's <span class="italic">Lady be Good</span> (1927) and receiving his first West End walk-on part at the Globe Theatre during the run of <span class="italic">The Squall</span> (1927). He decided to become an actor rather than a dancer and gained experience in weekly repertory in Northampton, where he took on about forty leading roles a year (1930&#150;32). &#145;They're extraordinary people in Northampton&#146;, he later recalled, &#145;they hold nothing against you. I still have friends there&#146;  (interview with Barry Norman, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Sept 1972).<br>
<br>Adrian's first big opportunity came when he appeared as Albert Arnold in an early Terence Rattigan comedy, <span class="italic">First Episode</span> (1934), which started out at a theatre club, Q, transferred to the Comedy Theatre in the West End and to New York under another title, <span class="italic">College Sinners</span>. But the play was less successful than expected and he returned to smaller roles and provincial appearances before appearing for the first time in a classical repertory company in London, playing Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw. His performance as Pandarus in a modern-dress <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> at the Westminster Theatre (1938) was further developed in a Royal Shakespeare Company production in 1960, and transformed for a generation the understanding of this lascivious, brooding character in Shakespeare's powerfully ambiguous, anti-war play.<br>
<br>Adrian joined the Old Vic company in 1939, playing the Dauphin in Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span>, and joined John Gielgud's company at the Haymarket (1944&#150;5) as Puck in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> and Osric in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. During the Second World War, exempted from military service, he discovered his talents in intimate revue, playing in Herbert Farjeon's <span class="italic">Light and Shade</span> (1942) at the Ambassadors. This genre, rarely seen today, gave him the chance to sing, dance, take part in short sketches, and explore his gift for timing pointed witticisms. He appeared in <span class="italic">Tuppence Coloured</span> (1947), <span class="italic">Oranges and Lemons</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Penny Plain</span> (1951), and <span class="italic">Airs on a Shoestring</span> (1953), which ran for almost two years at the Royal Court Theatre in London and subsequently toured. Its contributors included Michael Flanders, Donald Swann, and Joyce Grenfell, while the producer was Laurier Lister, who became Adrian's lifelong partner.<br>
<br>&#145;A pleasant and genial revue&#146;, wrote Ivor Brown in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1953, in which &#145;Max Adrian carries out most of the men's jobs&#146;, but the days of such light-hearted entertainment were coming to an end. The mood of British theatre was changing with John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1956) and the arrival of the Angry Young Men. The English Stage Company took over at the Royal Court Theatre, where Lister had his successes. A new generation of satire approached with <span class="italic">Beyond the Fringe</span> (1959). Adrian appeared in two less successful revues, <span class="italic">From Here to There</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Fresh Airs</span> (1956), which he co-directed, but in December 1956 he went to New York to play Dr Pangloss in <span class="italic">Candide</span> at the Martin Beck Theater. He stayed in the US to join summer stock companies and in 1958, appeared in a double bill, <span class="italic">The Lesson</span> and <span class="italic">The Chairs</span>, by the French-Romanian absurdist writer Eugene Ionesco, at the Phoenix Theater. The <span class="italic">New York Times</span> critic, Brookes Atkinson, wrote that his &#145;elaborate politesse, giving way gradually to fanaticism and ghastly exuberance, is funny and grisly at the same time&#146;  (obituary in <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 20 Jan 1973, quoting from a review published in 1958).<br>
<br>In Britain there were vigorous attempts to transform repertory theatre into a system which more closely resembled the continental models. The first came with the establishment of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) from its origins in the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford upon Avon. Its leader was the director Peter Hall, and the company was hired on long-term contracts to play in repertory in Stratford and London. Adrian was invited to join Hall's company with such actors as Peggy Ashcroft, Peter O'Toole, and Diana Rigg, a time which he recalled as the happiest in his life. &#145;There was a magic about that company&#146;  (interview with Barry Norman, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Sept 1972).<br>
<br>At the RSC actors were encouraged to extend their acting ranges by taking on roles for which they might not usually have been cast. Adrian played Feste in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Jacques in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Father Barr&eacute; in John Whiting's <span class="italic">The Devils</span>, and a range of smaller parts. His abilities as a team member brought him to the attention of Sir Laurence Olivier, who invited him to join the first National Theatre company in 1963. He played Polonius in the opening production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Serebryakov in Chekhov's <span class="italic">Uncle Vanya</span>, and the Inquisitor in Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span>. After leaving the National Theatre, he played in West End and regional theatres, before devising (with Lister) his first one-man show, <span class="italic">An Evening with G. B. S.</span> (George Bernard Shaw). With this and another one-man show, <span class="italic">Gilbert and Sullivan</span>, he toured the British Isles, the United States and (under the auspices of the British Council) many Commonwealth countries.<br>
<br>Adrian's screen career began with <span class="italic">The Primrose Path</span> (1933) and continued through many distinguished British films, such as Olivier's <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (1944). He usually provided memorable cameos rather than centre-screen performances, but under the director Ken Russell his sardonic but detached presence pervaded such films as <span class="italic">The Music Lovers</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">The Devils</span> (1970, from Whiting's play). He also appeared in lighter screen roles, in <span class="italic">The Boy Friend</span> (1971), or as Frankie Howerd's stooge in the television series <span class="italic">Up Pompeii</span>; but his most haunting performance perhaps came in Ken Russell's film made for television, <span class="italic">Song of Summer</span>, about the relationship between the infirm and partly paralysed composer, Delius, and his intuitive secretary, Eric Fenby. As Delius, Adrian's gestures were minimal, but he evoked the composer's fastidious and haunted sensibility.<br>
<br>Adrian died from a heart attack on 19 January 1973 at his home, Smarkham Orchard, Shamley Green, near Guildford, Surrey, after returning from the television studios where he had been recording Bertolt Brecht's <span class="italic">The Caucasian Chalk Circle</span> (1973) for the BBC. At his memorial service, the great names of British theatre at the time paid tribute to his style and professionalism. The lessons were read by Alec Guinness and Laurence Olivier, the tribute paid by Joyce Grenfell. He was survived by his partner, Laurier Lister, with whom he lived at Shamley Green.<br>
