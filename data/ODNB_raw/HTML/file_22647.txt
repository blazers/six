<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell,  George</span>  (1668?&#150;1714), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was apparently the son of Martin Powell (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1698), an actor in the King's Company. His date of birth is uncertain, but he is identified most plausibly as the George Powell who was born on 17 January 1668 and baptized in St Giles-in-the-Fields five days later, ten months after a Martin Powell had married Elizabeth Heath at St Clement Danes. About the time that he began his acting career George Powell married Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1723), who became a reliable actress for Christopher Rich's company, beginning in the 1695&#150;6 season. Her first known part was as Gammer Grime in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Luckey Chance</span> in April 1686, and she may have left the stage or played small parts for the next nine years. Almost nothing is known about her.<h2>
<a name="Actor"></a>Actor</h2>Powell began acting in the 1686&#150;7 season and may have appeared in a few plays before his first recorded performance as Don Cinthio in Behn's <span class="italic">Emperor of the Moon</span> (March 1687). Hannah Lee, a Bartholomew fair booth manager, claimed that he began acting there for her mother. He acted a large number of parts for the United Company and began to be given numerous prologues to speak, a sure sign of popularity and stardom. Tall, handsome, and with a fine voice and body, Powell was well suited for the stage and for heroic parts. In his early years he played such parts as Friendly in <span class="italic">The Widow Ranter</span>, Cassander in <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>, and the title roles in <span class="italic">Valentinian</span> and <span class="italic">Edward III</span>.<br>
<br>When his friend William Mountfort was murdered by a rival for Anne Bracegirdle's attention in 1692 Powell was given many of his parts. He was then often cast opposite Susanna Mountfort in an attempt to make them the new leading couple  (Holland, 152). Among the roles Powell took over were Granger in Dryden's <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave;-la-mode</span>, the rake Bellmour in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Batchelor</span>, and male leads such as Clerimont in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Love for Money</span>.<br>
<br>When he chose to stay with Christopher Rich at the time of the secession of Thomas Betterton and the majority of the most experienced players in the United Company in 1695, Powell was given many of Betterton's parts. Rich and his partner Sir Thomas Skipwith rewarded his loyalty with additional money as well as the parts and put him in charge of rehearsals. Among Powell's skills was &#145;taking off&#146; Betterton. Soon after the division of the companies he acted Heartwell in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Batchelor</span>, mimicking Betterton throughout; the intention, which succeeded, was to draw an audience away from the newly formed company at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Cibber, who acted Fondlewife as Thomas Doggett, wrote that Powell &#145;was allow'd to have burlesqu'd [Betterton] very well&#146;. Powell also acted Falstaff as Betterton. In a prologue in 1698, allegedly in retaliation for a &#145;scurrilous&#146; prologue spoken against him at &#145;Betterton's Booth&#146;, he mocked the ageing Betterton's taking the parts of heroic lovers:<blockquote>
<div>As when a nauseous Vizor in the Pit,<br>
</div>
<div>Grossly abuses, without Sense or Wit,<br>
</div>
<div>All justifie her merited disgrace,<br>
</div>
<div>If they unvail the grievance of the place,<br>
</div>
<div>And shew the drab in her own ugly face.<br>
</div>
<div>If in Return of a dam'd dull Abuse,<br>
</div>
<div>We pluck the Vizor off from t' other house:<br>
</div>
<div>And let you see their natural Grimmaces<br>
</div>
<div>Affecting Youth with pale Autumnal Faces.<br>
</div>
<div>Wou'd it not any Ladies Anger move<br>
</div>
<div>To see a Child of sixty-five make Love (Grunting like B).<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Fatal Discovery</span>, late February 1698; Danchin, 3.481)</blockquote>In this, his mid-career, Powell was playing Montezuma in <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span>, Aboan in <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>, Worthy in <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, Cornavo in <span class="italic">The Fatal Discovery</span>, Jaffeir in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, and the title roles in <span class="italic">Caligula</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, and <span class="italic">Achilles</span>. His parts tended to be those of the second man, not the lead, perhaps because of his rather unruly personality. Typical parts were Cassio in <span class="italic">Othello</span> and Lothario in <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>. He was a virtuoso actor, however, and the newspapers often mentioned his appearances in new, successful plays. Steele once wrote tellingly of one of his benefits:<blockquote>this Day the haughty <i>George Powell</i> hopes all the Good-natured Part of the Town, will favour him whome they Applauded in <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Timon</i>, <i>Lear</i> and <i>Orestes</i>, with their Company this Night, when he hazards all his Heroic Glory for their Approbation in the humbler Condition of honest <i>Jack Falstaff</i>. (R. Steele, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 7 April 1712)</blockquote>Both Addison and Steele wrote about Powell's frequent appearances as Alexander in various plays, and once included him in a fantasy performance in which he was to ride a &#145;Dromedary, which nevertheless Mr. <i>Powell</i>&#146; was to call &#145;Bucephalus&#146; to fight the comedian William Pinkethman as King Porus mounted on an elephant  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 5 April 1711). In spite of his irregular life, he continued to add roles until the end of his career. Among these were Portius in <span class="italic">Cato</span> and Cassius in <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span>.<h2>
<a name="Drinkerandbrawler"></a>Drinker and brawler</h2>The irrepressible Powell seems to have alternated theatrical triumphs with scrapes with the law. In spite of his immense talent and considerable ambition and competitiveness, he drank heavily and by 1696 occasionally even appeared drunk on stage. In that year he played himself in <span class="italic">The Female Wits</span>, was cast as the actor the women fought over, but was depicted as drinking in the early morning and unashamed of regarding &#145;neither Times nor Seasons in Drinking&#146;  (act <span class="smallcap">I</span>, scene xiii). Powell spent a great deal of his time at the bar of the Rose tavern. Thomas Davies wrote that he:<blockquote>often toasted to intoxication, his mistress, with bumpers of Nantz-brandy; he came sometimes so warm, with that noble spirit, to the theatre, that he courted the ladies, so furiously on stage, that, in the opinion of Sir John Vanbrugh, they were almost in danger of being conquered on the spot. (Davies, 3.416)</blockquote>Vanbrugh described Powell as having begun drinking at six in the morning and &#145;wadling&#146; on stage; he made a joke of the warmth of Powell's lovemaking when under the influence of alcohol:<blockquote>I confess I once gave <i>Amanda</i> [played by Jane Rogers] for gone, and am since (with all due Respect to Mrs. <i>Rogers</i>) very sorry she scap't; for I am confident a certain Lady &hellip; who highly blames the Play, for the barrenness of the conclusion, wou'd then have allowed it, a very natural Close. (J. Vanbrugh, preface to <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>)</blockquote>It is impossible to give a complete list of Powell's legal difficulties. As one of the king's servants, as all actors at the patent theatres were, he was subject to arrest and punishment by the lord chamberlain and the House of Lords alone, and that fact probably saved him from gaol on several occasions. For example, two people were ordered to be apprehended on 23 April 1690 for arresting Powell without the lord chamberlain's permission. Some of his problems stemmed from debt. In the early 1690s the journalist Abel Roper took him to court for &pound;10, and Daniel and Elizabeth Tofield carried on a three-year campaign to recover &pound;10 that he owed them for a purchase, and another man claimed &pound;30. About 1703 he was in a dispute with Christopher Rich over his pay and was not allowed to leave the company until he had paid his debts to it. Cibber said he was &#145;so hunted, by the sheriffs officers, for debt, that he usually walked the streets with his sword in his hand (sheathed)&#146;, and sometimes they would yell to him as he menaced them, &#145;We do not want you <i>now</i>, Master Powell&#146;  (Davies, 3.453).<br>
<br>Powell was a witness to the murder of William Mountfort, and he himself had a propensity for violence. He was arrested on 1 May 1698 for assaulting one of William Davenant's sons, probably Ralph, the treasurer of the company, or, less likely, Thomas, the nominal manager, &#145;with the intention, as [it] seem'd, to kill him&#146;, and then drawing his sword on Lieutenant-Colonel Stanhope, who tried to intervene  (Milhous and Hume, 1.329&#150;30). For this offence, he was confined briefly in the Gatehouse, and the bond was set at a rather high &pound;200 for himself and &pound;100 each for two friends who would swear for his good behaviour. Ralph was murdered by would-be robbers on 18 May 1698, and that may have ended the case. Powell was one of the actors ordered suspended for assaulting Aaron Hill on 2 June 1710. Hill had been made manager of William Collier's company, and the actors reacted with violence to Hill's style. Hill's complaint read, &#145;Powell had shortened his sword to stab me in the Back &amp; had cut a Gentlemans hand through who prevented the thrust&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 12.113). The lord chamberlain noted in his order to discharge Powell from &#145;her Majesty's Company&#146; that he had been &#145;formerly guilty of the like offenses&#146;  (ibid.). For both of these assaults Powell was suspended from acting for several months. Once when Drury Lane employed him before the suspension had expired the lord chamberlain shut the theatre down. In 1698 his actions contributed to Lord Monmouth moving in the House of Lords that actors should not be allowed to wear swords.<br>
<br>Like many actors of his generation, Powell was occasionally in legal trouble for trying to change companies without permission or for giving a performance or two at a small theatre. He was confined to the Porter's Lodge, a place often used to gaol minor offenders against the crown, privy council, or parliament, for leaving Lincoln's Inn Fields in June 1704, and was arrested in November 1705 for refusing to act at the Queen's Theatre. The annotation with this apprehension suggests his unusually violent temper; it charges him with attempting to incite a riot in the company, and ten days later, on 24 November, the companies were ordered not to employ him because he &#145;behav'd himself with great insolence&#146;. Cibber described him as one of the company with &#145;contempt of all discipline&#146; when Wilks became manager. Wilks &#145;was reduced to the necessity of challenging and fighting several amongst the ring-leaders&#146;, including Powell, who refused to fight  (Davies, 3.452). He was, however, indisputably an excellent, desirable actor. Congreve and Vanbrugh were complained against for trying to hire Powell in December 1705, and in 1707 Drury Lane was silenced once again for letting him perform before his suspension was up.<h2>
<a name="Playwrightandplagiarist"></a>Playwright&#151;and plagiarist?</h2>Powell wrote <span class="italic">The Treacherous Brothers</span> (1689), <span class="italic">Alphonso, King of Naples</span> (1690), <span class="italic">A Very Good Wife</span> (1693), <span class="italic">Bonduca</span> (1695), and <span class="italic">The Imposture Defeated</span> (1697). Both <span class="italic">The Treacherous Brothers</span> and <span class="italic">Alphonso</span> are violent tragedies with big doses of the time's popular rant and pathos. <span class="italic">The Treacherous Brothers</span> includes romantic love, a poisoning, and a scene of Menaphon impaled on spikes. <span class="italic">Alphonso</span> features rival lovers killing each other and then an emotional scene for the heroine, who stabs herself and speaks her last lines &#145;bleeding, her hair hanging loose&#146;. Powell used music well in his plays, and in 1696 he and John Verbruggen rewrote Nahum Tate's <span class="italic">Brutus of Alba</span> into an opera. The piece shows their canny business and theatrical sense, for they used popular elements from Tate's and other plays, got Daniel Purcell to write some of the songs, and used four sets from Dryden's <span class="italic">Albion and Albanius</span>, two from Shadwell's <span class="italic">Psyche</span>, one from Settle's <span class="italic">Fairy Queen</span>, and pieces of sets from other lavish productions. The stunning machinery came from <span class="italic">Albion</span> and <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen</span>  (Holland, 45).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Very Good Wife</span>, a play Powell whipped up to take advantage of the demand for new satiric comedies in the 1692&#150;3 season, is composed of chunks of Richard Brome's <span class="italic">The City Wit</span> and <span class="italic">The Court Beggar</span> and James Shirley's <span class="italic">Hide Park</span>. Brome's Crasy becomes Courtwit, &#145;A Gentleman, who by his Generous Temper, has wasted his Fortunes, and put to his shifts&#146;, a premier part for Powell  (Holland, 159). Mary Pix accused him of plagiarizing most of <span class="italic">Imposture Defeated</span> from her <span class="italic">The Deceiver Deceived</span> while it was still in manuscript. Pix had offered her play to Drury Lane when Powell had the power to reject it, and his <span class="italic">Imposture Defeated</span> was produced in September 1697. Her play was performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in late November. In his preface &#145;To the reader&#146; Powell writes that the play was &#145;only a slight piece of Scribble, purely designed for the Introduction of a little Musick, being no more than a short weeks work&#146;. He avers he never read her play, although he did as she requested and asked the company to consider it before &#145;she very mannerly carry'd the Play to the other House&#146;. In the part of Bondi, by whatever means conceived, he created another virtuoso role for himself. He insisted that both he and Pix got the plot from an unnamed novel, and Laura Rosenthal has pointed out that no playwright in that time feared any legal action for plagiarism  (Rosenthal, 181&#150;2). The prologue at Lincoln's Inn Fields begins:<blockquote>
<div>Our Authoress, like true Women, shew'd her Play<br>
</div>
<div>To some, who, like true Wits, stole't half away,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and this may be the &#145;abuse&#146; that Powell was answering in the prologue that mocked Betterton. Pix, known for her unattractive face and figure, may be the &#145;nauseous Vizor&#146; who &#145;merited disgrace&#146;. Unlike Pix's play, Powell's play emphasizes farcical debauchery and drunkenness rather than her intrigue comedy plot about arranged marriages. It also depends upon music for much of its entertainment and includes <span class="italic">Endimion &hellip; a Masque</span> (act <span class="smallcap">V</span>, scene i).<br>
<br>Powell's career was marked by irascible, erratic behaviour, and, after the actors' secession, he changed theatres often. In the winter of 1701 he moved from Drury Lane to Lincoln's Inn Fields, returned to Drury Lane in June 1704, then in April 1705 went to the Queen's Theatre, and, after a suspension, back to Rich's Drury Lane in February 1707, where he spent the rest of his career except for brief appearances such as those at Pinkethman's Greenwich Theatre. Powell died on 14 December 1714 and was buried four days later at St Clement Danes. His funeral was paid for by the Drury Lane Theatre and the expenses included 5 quarts of white port, 5 quarts of red, and 4 quarts of sack. Obituaries ranked him in talent with Betterton and Charles Hart; Joseph Addison declared him &#145;excellently form'd for a Tragedian, and, when he pleases, deserves the Admiration of the best Judges&#146;  (J. Addison, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 16 April 1711), and Thomas Davies summed him up as &#145;an actor of genius&#146;  (Davies, 3.453). His wife acted at least until the year of Powell's death and survived him by a number of years.<br>
