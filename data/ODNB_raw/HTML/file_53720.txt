<span class="headword">Skinner,  Cortlandt</span>  (1727&#150;1799), <span class="occ">politician and army officer in America</span>, was born on 16 December 1727 at Perth Amboy, Middlesex county, New Jersey; he was the eldest son of the Revd William Skinner (1687&#150;1758), Scottish-born clergyman in the Church of England, and Elizabeth Van Cortlandt (1694&#150;1763), heir to 8900 acres in New York. On 30 November 1751 he married Elizabeth Kearny (1731&#150;1810), daughter of a New Jersey assemblyman who was acclaimed that colony's foremost lawyer; they raised twelve children to adulthood, one of whom, Maria, was a noted diarist [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47677/', "Nugent, Maria")</script>].<br>
<br>Skinner received a classical education from his father, a renowned tutor; by 1776 his library held 482 volumes. He mastered the law at Newark while clerking for David Ogden, a member of the governor's council, and then began practising at Perth Amboy. He became attorney-general aged just twenty-seven, presumably through Ogden's patronage.<br>
<br>Perth Amboy elected Skinner to the New Jersey assembly in 1763. Possessing gifted oratorical talent he gained such respect that he was unanimously chosen speaker two years later. He was the second youngest man to have assumed that position, which he would keep until 1776. The assembly tapped Skinner to replace a speaker who had wavered in his opposition to parliament's first inland revenue upon the American colonies, the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. Skinner detested the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> and presided over the session that condemned it as having &#145;Endanger'd both their Liberty and Property&#146;  (Purvis, 244) but his perspective was essentially pragmatic. He dismissed the idea that George Grenville's ministry threatened American self-government but he firmly believed that parliamentary taxation and Whitehall's efforts to extend royal prerogatives were ill-conceived and counter-productive. He believed that these measures could only engender political discontent among the colonists and carried enormous risk of Britain's &#145;alienating a people which she might make her greatest prop and security&#146;  (Whitehead, 103) by sowing fear that their rights as Englishmen were menaced. He asserted that Britain's greatest advantage lay in encouraging growth and prosperity for the colonies, the largest market for British manufactured goods, because &#145;the wealth flowing from trade will be more for the Interest of Britain than all the taxes that can be imposed on the colonies&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>A strong sense of British patriotism also gripped Skinner, who took pride in his family's military services against the French. His aunt married Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who commanded Britain's naval forces at Louisbourg's capture in 1745. One of his three brothers died a lieutenant-colonel in the royal army and another retired a major.<br>
<br>The governor of New Jersey, William Franklin, strengthened Skinner's sense of obligation to Britain by defending his brother, provincial treasurer Stephen Skinner, when the Skinners' political rivals demanded Stephen's resignation in 1768 after burglars stole &pound;6000 in public funds from his home. The governor appointed Stephen a councillor in 1769 and helped to stave off his resignation until 1774. Franklin left the Skinners profoundly indebted to royal officialdom.<br>
<br>Skinner was offered any civil or military post at the disposal of New Jersey's patriots in August 1775, and they considered his refusal a major setback. Although he still publicly opposed parliamentary taxation he privately believed that the North ministry's ineptitude had allowed incipient discontent to ripen into widespread, armed resistance. After the interception of a letter revealing his contempt for the continental congress he fled to avoid arrest in January 1776.<br>
<br>Skinner was one of just three speakers of colonial assemblies, sitting or former, who actively opposed American independence. Appointed brigadier-general in the British army on 4 September 1776 he recruited the largest of the loyalist units. His 2000 New Jersey volunteers mercilessly harassed their American patriot enemies from New York's defensive outposts on Staten Island throughout 1783. Only three other Americans attained a rank equivalent to Skinner's in the loyalist American corps.<br>
<br>The American patriots confiscated Skinner's estates, worth &pound;10,382, for which parliament authorized compensation of &pound;5169 plus a &pound;500 pension. After the war he brought his family to England and retired in Bristol on his annuity. There he died on 15 March 1799 and was buried at St Augustine's Church.<br>
