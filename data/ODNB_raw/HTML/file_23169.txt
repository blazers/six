<span class="headword">Raven,  John Samuel</span>  (1829&#150;1877), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 21 August 1829, probably in Preston, the son of the Revd Thomas Raven (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1868), the minister of Holy Trinity Church in Preston, and his wife, Susanna Horrocks; he was baptized at St John's, Preston, on 5 October 1829. Thomas Raven, who later lived in Torquay, was himself a painter, and produced watercolours of mountain and coastal subjects; he is represented by a group of six drawings of Welsh and Devon subjects which he presented to the Victoria and Albert Museum. It seems that the Raven family were financially independent, although it is not known how this fortune originated. According to J. S. Raven's obituary in <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, he was descended on his mother's side from the astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks.<br>
<br>John Samuel Raven seems to have had no other professional instruction beyond that which he received from his father and what he learned from looking at the works of earlier British landscape painters. According to the author of the introduction to the catalogue of the 1878 Burlington Fine Arts Club exhibition of Raven's paintings, Raven, as a young man, studied the work of John Crome and Constable; certainly his early paintings have a breadth of handling and harmonious balance of tone reminiscent of the Norwich school. Raven is also believed to have looked carefully at works by the Scottish painter the Revd John Thomson of Duddingston.<br>
<br>Although there is no indication of direct contact by Raven with artists such as Millais, Holman Hunt, or Ford Madox Brown, the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism is strongly felt in his landscape paintings of the 1850s. Works such as <span class="italic">Saint-Foin in Bloom</span> (exh. RA, 1859; priv. coll.) are characterized by extraordinary elaboration of detail, rich and intense colour, and poetic feeling. Admired by John Ruskin, it was perhaps <span class="italic">Saint-Foin in Bloom</span> that the author of the 1878 catalogue introduction had in mind when writing of him: &#145;he has attained a level, which is superior to any school or special method, and has shown a consummate skill in realising, by original means, effects which none but a poetical mind could have conceived&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works of the Late John Samuel Raven</span>, 4). The artist's instinct towards meticulous detail crossed with intense mood was maintained at least until the end of the 1860s. The view at Dunkeld on the River Tay that he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1869 (Perth Museum and Art Gallery) was looked on with favour by the reviewer of the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>:<blockquote>J. S. Raven, an artist of much promise in years gone by, we had almost lost sight of &hellip; The study is most conscientious, and really, in these days, to come upon one remnant of the now wholly obsolete Pre-Raffaelitism of the past, is a delightful curiosity. (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1869, 172)</blockquote>During the early and mid-1850s Raven lived at St Leonards, Sussex. From 1856 he seems to have moved from place to place, sending paintings to exhibitions from addresses in Torquay (Lansdown Hall, where perhaps Thomas Raven was living in retirement), and Bedale in Yorkshire (where his brother, the Revd Milville Raven, was rector). On 15 June 1869 he married Margaret Sinclair, daughter of Peter Dunbar, an Indian army officer, and in that year he seems to have settled in London, living first at James Street, Westbourne Terrace, and then at Westbourne Park. In 1871 alpine and north Italian subjects by Raven appeared at exhibition, presumably the result of a honeymoon tour.<br>
<br>Raven was represented at the Royal Academy summer exhibitions most years from 1849 through to the year of his death. None the less, according to <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, he &#145;was one of the painters who had reason to think themselves other than handsomely treated by the Royal Academy&#146;; the writer added, as a comment on the academy's well-known prejudice against progressive landscape painting, &#145;in this, indeed, he had plenty of landscapists to keep him company&#146;  (1877, 75). Raven worked chiefly in oils, but occasionally also in watercolour. He was not a prolific artist, and many of his recorded works, including <span class="italic">Midsummer Moonlight</span> (said by <span class="italic">The Academy</span> to be his finest painting), remain untraced.<br>
<br>Raven drowned while bathing at Harlech in north Wales on 13 July 1877. He left one son, and his widow later married the painter William Bright Morris; Raven's sister Kate had married the painter and designer Henry Holiday in 1864. A memorial exhibition of Raven's paintings and sketches was held at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1878.<br>
