<span class="headword">Dove,  John</span>  (1561&#150;1618), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, a Surrey man, was a scholar of St Peter's College, Westminster, from which he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1580. He graduated BA on 5 February 1584 and proceeded MA on 16 March 1587, BD on 22 November 1593, and DD on 1 July 1596. He was presented to the rectory of Tidworth, Wiltshire, in 1596 by Lord Chancellor Thomas Egerton and collated by Archbishop Whitgift on 5 November of that year to the rectory of St Mary Aldermary, London, which he held for the rest of his life. In 1597, however, he received a licence from the privy council to travel abroad for three years.<br>
<br>Aside from his pastoral duties Dove was an author of some repute, publishing seven tracts between 1594 and 1613 in which he revealed himself to be a capable and a loyal defender of the Church of England as established by law. In a 1594 tract containing a sermon originally preached at Paul's Cross he identified the Roman Antichrist as that Antichrist spoken of in scripture, and, following on from the theological controversies at Cambridge University in 1595&#150;6, he published another sermon (again previously preached at Paul's Cross) in which he advocated the Calvinist interpretation of the doctrine of divine predestination. In 1601 he published a sermon upon the legality of divorce, arguing that the word of God did not allow a man to divorce his wife and marry another, even if his wife had previously committed adultery. In <span class="italic">A Perswasion to the English Recusants, to Reconcile themselves to the Church of England</span> (1603), dedicated to James I, he appealed to the recusant population to frequent holy communion as celebrated by the Church of England; he played down the differences between the two churches, although he was careful to add a section addressed &#145;to the protestant reader&#146; which laid out his impeccable protestant credentials. A tract confuting atheism in the realm (1605) was followed in 1606 by <span class="italic">A Defence of Church Government</span>, in which he defended against puritan criticism both the use of episcopacy by the church and the employment of the sign of the cross in the baptismal rubric of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Dove died in April 1618.<br>
