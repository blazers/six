<span class="headword">Virgilius</span> <span class="st"> [St Virgilius]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 784), <span class="occ">bishop of Salzburg</span>, was almost certainly born an Irishman. Both an anonymous verse epitaph and a poem by his younger contemporary, Alcuin, refer to his Irish origin, but nothing is known of his career before he appears in Francia.<h2>
<a name="Continentalcareer"></a>Continental career</h2>Virgilius is first attested on the continent in or shortly after 743. The earliest account of his career, in the <span class="italic">Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum</span>, written in 870 or 871, places him at the court at Quierzy of the Carolingian Pippin III, then mayor of the palace, though effective ruler, of the Frankish kingdom. He won the confidence of Pippin and was sent <i>c</i>.745 to Bavaria, apparently with the approval of Odilo, duke of the Bavarians, despite the tense relationship between the two rulers. After the death of John, bishop of Salzburg and abbot of the monastery of St Peter there, in June 746 or 747, Virgilius became abbot-bishop, although he was not consecrated until late 748 or 749. Virgilius may have advised Pippin on issues of canon law, and may also have had a role in procuring the sanction of Pope Zacharias for Pippin's usurpation of the kingship of the Franks, and for the anointing ceremony which followed it. While he was supported by the Bavarian dukes, Virgilius maintained links with the Frankish court and is believed to have worked closely with Fulrad, abbot of St Denis and chaplain to the Carolingian kings. Close connections between Salzburg and St Denis are suggested by the script in use at Salzburg, which resembles that of St Denis, and the style of Salzburg Cathedral, commenced in 767, as well as by the entry concerning Fulrad in the <span class="italic">Liber confraternitatum</span> of St Peter's, which was begun during the year preceding Virgilius's death.<br>
<br>Initially, Virgilius performed only the duties of abbot at Salzburg, handing over the episcopal functions to his compatriot Dubdagrecus (Dub-d&aacute;-chr&iacute;ch), who later became abbot of the monastery of Chiemsee. Virgilius spent the years following his consecration consolidating the role of the diocese and, above all, organizing missions to Carinthia and Pannonia (in present-day terms, an area extending from southern Austria to western Hungary). Among the missionaries whom he sent there, Dupliterus (Dub-Littir) certainly, and Modestus possibly, had also come from Ireland, perhaps with Virgilius.<br>
<br>During the early years of his career, Virgilius had an uneasy relationship with the papal legate, St Boniface (<i>d</i>. 754). From the correspondence between Boniface and the pope we learn that Boniface objected to the decision of Virgilius and his companion Sidonius not to rebaptize those who had been christened by a priest in Bavaria with the incorrect formula &#145;baptizo te in nomine patria et filia et spiritus sancti&#146; (literally, &#145;I baptize you in the name fatherland and daughter and of the Holy Spirit&#146;. Zacharias took Virgilius's side, and rebuked Boniface for his ignorance of canon law on the matter. The pope was more favourable to Boniface in a letter of 1 May 748, in which he replied to the latter's complaint that Virgilius propagated the heretical doctrine of the antipodes, which claimed that people lived on the other side of the earth, and that there were another sun and moon there. Virgilius and Sidonius were summoned to the pope, and Boniface empowered to call a synod and excommunicate Virgilius if the accusations could be substantiated. It would seem that Virgilius was vindicated, since no further references to the controversy exist, and he was consecrated bishop shortly after the date of the letter. Virgilius's long career came to an end with his death on 27 November 784, his feast day.<br>
<br>In spite of his undoubted high standing, attested by his participation in synods and his involvement with the Bavarian dukes in legal transactions, both as witness and as defender of the rights of the church of Salzburg, Virgilius was forgotten at his episcopal church until his body was discovered there in 1181. His remains were then translated and his life written. In 1233 efforts to secure his canonization were successful, making him one of the few Irish saints recognized by the church.<h2>
<a name="TheIrishbackground"></a>The Irish background</h2>Since the seventeenth century Virgilius has been sometimes identified with Fergil, abbot of the Irish monastery of Aghaboe (Laois). Since the <span class="italic">Liber confraternitatum</span> of St Peter's at Salzburg includes a list of the abbots of Iona from Columba to Sl&eacute;ib&iacute;ne (<i>d</i>. 767), there was clearly some connection between Virgilius's see and Iona, and the repeated mention of Cainnech, the patron saint of Aghaboe, in the eighth-century life of Columba of Iona might provide a possible link between Virgilius and Aghaboe via Iona. In its entry for the year 784, the seventeenth-century compilation known as the annals of the four masters is explicit: &#145;Feirghil, i.e. the Geometer, abbot of Achadh B&oacute;, died in Germany, in the thirteenth year of his bishopric&#146;. The accuracy of the year of Virgilius's death given here, and the nature of the added information, could mean that the seventeenth-century compilers were responsible for the identification themselves, especially since the annals of Ulster give the obit of Feirgil of Aghaboe under the year 789 (almost certainly a contemporary entry), and report no connection with Germany. It has also been thought that Virgilius could be identified with Fergil, <i>vir sanctus</i> and son of Mael D&uacute;in, who appears in the twelfth-century Rawlinson genealogies as a descendant of Loegaire, one of the many sons of the mythical Irish king N&iacute;all No&iacute;g&iacute;allach (N&iacute;all &#145;of the Nine Hostages&#146;), which would place his lineage in a branch of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Meath.<h2>
<a name="LiteraryandartisticactivityatVirgiliussSalzburg"></a>Literary and artistic activity at Virgilius's Salzburg</h2>While no work in Virgilius's own hand is extant, various texts betray his influence. The confraternity book, still in the library of St Peter's Abbey in Salzburg, was commenced just before he died in 784. The contents of this monumental work, comprising the names of many hundreds for whose souls the monks at Salzburg offered prayers, show the extent of the connections which Virgilius enjoyed. Palaeographical details in this and other Salzburg manuscripts also point to the scribes' Irish training or use of Irish exemplars. Copies of works such as <span class="italic">De locis sanctis</span> by Adomn&aacute;n of Iona, penitentials, and a litany in a prayer book later preserved at the monastery of Fleury, testify to an interest in Irish texts at Salzburg even after the death of Virgilius. He is also credited with having commissioned the first Salzburg annals and the original life of Rupert, patron of Salzburg, whose translation from Worms he instigated. The so-called &#145;Rupertus-Kreuz&#146; (processional cross) may have been made for this occasion. The famous &#145;Tassilo chalice&#146;, now at the monastery of Kremsm&uuml;nster in Austria, which is named after Odilo's successor as duke of the Bavarians (<i>d</i>. 788) and displays both Irish and Northumbrian characteristics, may also have been used in Virgilius's cathedral.<br>
<br>Scholars have also proposed that Virgilius was the author of a cosmography, written under the pseudonym Aethicus Ister, and supposedly devised as a retort to his old adversary, Boniface. Although some traces of Irish influence in the text may point to the circle around Virgilius, his authorship has yet to be proven.<br>
