<span class="headword">Simpson,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1709/10, <em>d.</em> in or after 1766), <span class="occ">evangelist and preacher</span>, was the son of Thomas Sympson, and was brought up in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Possibly because of the influence of John Wesley, then living in nearby Epworth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, aged eighteen, as a servitor in 1728. There he became Wesley's pupil and a member of the Holy Club (the Oxford Methodists). He graduated in 1731, and after ordination obtained a valuable Leicestershire living.<br>
<br>During the 1730s Simpson kept in touch with Wesley, and when the evangelical revival began, he was drawn into it. By November 1739 he was in London, the centre of the revival. He preached in Benjamin Ingham's Yorkshire societies, and in January 1740 visited Ingham's followers in Nottingham. Wesley seems to have left Simpson in charge of his fledgeling Foundery Society, established for his London followers because he disapproved of the doctrine of &#145;stillness&#146; which was taking hold of the revival's &#145;headquarters&#146;, the Fetter Lane Society. But by April Simpson had himself espoused &#145;stillness&#146;, rejecting the sacraments, and led opposition to Charles Wesley in both societies. The dispute resulted in the Wesleys' withdrawal from the Fetter Lane Society that July.<br>
<br>In November 1740 Simpson, who had by now resigned his living, moved to Ockbrook, Derbyshire, and became leader of the societies established by Ingham's followers there and in Nottingham. In 1741 Simpson's teaching of &#145;stillness&#146; annoyed the countess of Huntingdon&#151;although she believed he was &#145;a good man and means well&#146;  (undated letter to James Hutton, Moravian Church House, London, AB88.A3.12.1)&#151;and she asked the Fetter Lane Society to recall him. They replied that they had not sent him, but none the less asked him to return, which he declined to do.<br>
<br>By now the Moravians had taken over the Fetter Lane Society. When Simpson visited them in August 1741, they judged him to be &#145;ehrlich; aber doch eigen&#146; (&#145;honest but peculiar&#146;; London Moravian diary, 12 Aug 1741). They remonstrated with him for going to Ockbrook, acting unilaterally, and fostering error. In April 1742 Moravian opposition to Simpson's planned marriage to an unconverted woman prompted him to repudiate them. Meetings with Lady Huntingdon and the Wesleys ensued, but he stood by his teachings and, though initially thought to have made common cause with the Wesleys, remained independent.<br>
<br>Simpson's support in Ockbrook grew (two houses were built for him), and he visited Nottingham quarterly, but in 1743 several members of his society withdrew after the Moravians, who thought he acted &#145;like a madman&#146;  (Moravian English Conference minutes, 15 Sept 1742, Moravian Church House, London), publicly disowned him for refusing to obey directions. By May only ten remained; thirty of Simpson's former followers requested Moravian supervision in January 1744.<br>
<br>John Wesley's journal entries recording meetings with Simpson display continued affection: &#145;Whatever he does is in the uprightness of his heart. But he is led into a thousand mistakes by one wrong principle &hellip; the making inward impressions his rule of action, and not the written word&#146;  (22 June 1742, J. Wesley, 3.26); he was &#145;the oddest, honestest enthusiast, surely, that ever was upon earth&#146;  (28 Nov 1743, ibid., 3.113); this &#145;original enthusiast &hellip; spoke many good things, in a manner peculiar to himself &hellip; what pity it is this well-meaning man should ever speak without an interpreter!&#146;  (17 Aug 1745, ibid., 3.202). In November 1747 Simpson aroused Wesley's sympathy when he was drawn to London by the offer of a living, but was then asked to stop preaching outside church&#151;a condition to which he could not agree.<br>
<br>Still living and preaching in Ockbrook, in 1748&#150;9 Simpson's repeated drunkenness and the content of his conversations to and about women gave offence. He railed against the Moravians, seeming &#145;crazy if not fuddled&#146;  (Bedford Moravian Labourers' Conference minutes, 1 Jan 1750, Bedfordshire RO, MO.2) when doing so in a Bedford inn. He was in Derby gaol by January 1751, and still there in October 1753. By 1757 he was out of prison, still living in Ockbrook and preaching to five or six people every Sunday. He is last recorded living in Ockbrook in 1766; details of his date and place of death are unknown.<br>
