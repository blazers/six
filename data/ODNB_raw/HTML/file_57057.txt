<span class="headword">St John,  Christopher Marie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Christabel Gertrude Marshall]</span>  (1871&#150;1960), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 24 October 1871 at 38 High Street, Exeter, the youngest of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18134/', "Emma Marshall, n&#233;e Martin (1828&#150;1899)")</script>, novelist, and Hugh Graham Marshall (<i>c</i>.1825&#150;1899), manager of the West of England Bank. She changed her name on her conversion to Catholicism in adulthood, which may have contributed to a rift with her mother, whose protestant commitment and aversion to Roman Catholicism were evident in her writings. For whatever reasons, St John later claimed to have been illegitimate, and attempted (with some success) to conceal her origins. Educated from 1894 at Somerville College, Oxford, she developed skills as a historian and translator, before moving to London where she worked as temporary secretary to Lady Randolph Churchill and Winston Churchill.<br>
<br>After a relationship with the musician Violet Gwynne (later Gordon Woodhouse) in 1895, St John met Ellen Terry's daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39083/', "Edith Ailsa Geraldine Craig (1869&#150;1947)")</script>, with whom she was to set up house at 7 Smith Square, Westminster. After moving to Adelphi Terrace House, they settled in the third-floor flat at 31 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, and when Ellen Terry bought the former port officer's house, at Smallhythe Place, Tenterden, Kent, they acquired a second home at nearby Priest's House. Their relationship became temporarily strained when Craig received a marriage proposal from the musician Martin Shaw and St John attempted suicide.<br>
<br>St John's first published book, <span class="italic">The Crimson Weed</span> (1900), an exploration of passion and revenge, was a novel concerning the illegitimate son of an opera singer. She had been attracted to the stage since childhood, giving her first performance at a drawing-room entertainment, where, in a man's dress suit, she sang the comic song &#145;The Frenchman&#146;. She was a member of the Stage Society as Christabel Marshall, acting in Gilbert Murray's translation of <span class="italic">Andromache</span> at the Garrick Theatre in 1904. Her translation of <span class="italic">The Good Hope</span> performed by the Stage Society was published under her assumed name, Christopher St John. Through her association with Craig and Terry, she acted at the Imperial Theatre, first appearing in <span class="italic">The Vikings</span> in 1903; her first speaking part, under the stage name of Joanna Willett, was in Clo Graves's play <span class="italic">The Mistress of the Robes</span>.<br>
<br>St John had continued with her literary efforts, publishing several pieces in Pamela Colman Smith's magazine, the <span class="italic">Green Sheaf</span>, including an elegiac monograph, <span class="italic">Henry Irving</span>, on the actor's death in 1905. She also wrote the first of several biographies of Ellen Terry in 1907, during Terry's American tour.<br>
<br>Both St John and Craig were active in the women's suffrage movement. St John wrote plays and articles in support of the movement, and was arrested in 1909 for setting fire to a pillar box. Involved in the Women's Social and Political Union, she was a committee member of the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society and the Women Writers' Suffrage League. For the latter organization she was photographed holding a banner with Craig and Cicely Hamilton in a street procession of 1910. All three women acted in <span class="italic">A Pageant of Great Women</span> (1909), a play devised by Hamilton and Craig, which was performed nationwide.<br>
<br>An understanding of the economic determinants of social inequalities was apparent in the plays St John translated and co-wrote. She translated from the Dutch plays by Herman Heijermans and co-wrote with Cicely Hamilton <span class="italic">How the Vote was Won</span> and <span class="italic">The Pot and the Kettle</span>, and with Charles Thursby, <span class="italic">The Coronation</span>. Her historical skills were also evident in her plays, especially <span class="italic">The First Actress</span>, <span class="italic">The Pageant of the Stage</span>, and <span class="italic">Macrena</span>.<br>
<br>When the Pioneer Players society was founded in 1911, with Edith Craig as director and Ellen Terry as president, Christopher St John contributed as dramatist, translator, and actor. She was also honorary secretary from 1915 to 1920, and a member of the advisory and casting committees. The Pioneer Players performed both St John's own plays and a number of her translations of works by Herman Heijermans, Isi Collin, and Jose Echegeray, including her most significant translation of a play by the first female dramatist, Hrotsvit. <span class="italic">Paphnutius</span> was given a world premi&egrave;re by Craig for the Pioneer Players in January 1914.<br>
<br>During the First World War, St John continued to act and write plays. She wrote about her relationship with Craig in her journal, <span class="italic">The Golden Book</span> (1911), and in her anonymously published second novel, <span class="italic">Hungerheart: the Story of a Soul</span> (1915). In a hybrid form of <i>Bildungsroman</i> and <i>roman &agrave; clef</i>, this narrative represents the development of a lesbian or &#145;invert&#146; whose sexuality is mediated through the self-abnegation of Roman Catholicism. In 1916 the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48921/', "Clare (Tony) Atwood (1866&#150;1962)")</script> joined Edith Craig and Christopher St John in their flat at 31 Bedford Street, Covent Garden. St John recalled Bernard Shaw's suggestion that she write about this <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i>, which was to be lifelong, disrupted only by Craig's death in 1947. To <span class="italic">Edy: Recollections of Edith Craig</span> (1949), edited by Eleanor Adlard, St John contributed an essay, &#145;Close-up&#146;, in which she noted that they achieved independence within their intimate relationships: Craig, Atwood, and St John, working respectively in the theatre, art, and literature, drew creative inspiration and support from each other.<br>
<br>After Terry's death in 1928, St John and Craig revised and edited <span class="italic">Ellen Terry's Memoirs</span> (1933). St John edited Ellen Terry's <span class="italic">Four Lectures on Shakespeare</span> (1932) and the <span class="italic">Shaw&#150;Terry Correspondence</span> (1931). Craig raised funds to establish her mother's house as a memorial and on its grounds, the Barn Theatre, in which an annual memorial performance was given. St John acted there in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> in 1929 and subsequently in several other pieces. The Barn Theatre and Priest's House became the focus of a busy social and cultural life in Kent for women and actors in particular. Craig, St John, and Atwood, known as &#145;Edy and the boys&#146;, were close friends with Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge after the adverse publicity of the trial for obscenity in 1928 of Hall's novel <span class="italic">The Well of Loneliness</span>. The five spent Christmas together in 1931 and 1932. St John and Craig attended the Stage Society's production in 1930 of Colette's <span class="italic">Ch&eacute;ri</span>, organized by Gabrielle Enthoven and Una Troubridge. St John's journal documented her short-lived relationship with Vita Sackville-West in 1932; her difficulties in coming to terms with this rejection met with sympathy from Ethel Smyth but irritation from Virginia Woolf.<br>
<br>As music critic, St John wrote for <span class="italic">The Lady</span> under the initials C. M., and for <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> from 1920 to 1931. She published her translations of Hrotsvit's plays (1923) and biographies of Christine Murrell MD (1935) and Ethel Smyth (1958); the latter, completed in spite of considerable ill health, was distinguished by the Book Society as book of the month. Some of her writings were apparently unpublished, such as the plays <span class="italic">What a Plague is Love</span> and <span class="italic">The White Room</span>.<br>
<br>St John died at West View, Tenterden, Kent, England, on 20 October 1960 after suffering pneumonia and heart disease. In response to the obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Vita Sackville-West wrote that &#145;she was in the grand tradition of English eccentrics&#146; remembered as &#145;a Shakespeare character &hellip; roaringly rumbustious&#146;, while Dame Sybil Thorndike recalled her as &#145;vivid &hellip; too much an individual in her life and work to be one of the most popular&#146;.<br>
