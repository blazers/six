<span class="headword">James,  Walter Haweis</span>  (1847&#150;1927), <span class="occ">army officer, politician, and military writer</span>, was born on 9 July 1847, the youngest son of H. C. James and his wife, Elizabeth Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Page. The family home was Bushmead Hall, Bedford. Educated privately, James entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned in 1867 into the Royal Engineers. He married in 1871 Fanny Eugenia Mabel Caunter, the only daughter of the Revd G. Akehurst, and they had one daughter and three sons.<br>
<br>In 1877 James passed the Staff College course with honours, going on to serve in the War Office intelligence department. Promoted captain in 1879, he served on campaign as a deputy assistant quartermaster-general in the Anglo-Zulu War, but failed to distinguish himself, and retired from the army in 1880 to go into politics.<br>
<br>A staunch Conservative, James contested the parliamentary seat of West St Pancras unsuccessfully in 1885. Between 1889 and 1892 he was a member of the London county council, becoming a whip of the Moderate Party and chairman of the sanitary committee. In 1899 he was made vice-chairman of the Primrose League, on the grand council of which he served for several years.<br>
<br>Re-employed by the army in 1901 at the height of the South African War, James served in the War Office as assistant to the permanent under-secretary, being promoted major in 1901 and lieutenant-colonel in 1903. Leaving the army once again, he played a small but significant part in the army reform movement as the author of numerous newspaper and magazine articles, and as editor of the famous <span class="roman">Wolseley Series</span> of military textbooks, and established something of a reputation as a military pundit. He published two military books of his own, <span class="italic">Modern Strategy</span> (1903), intended as a textbook for army officers, and <span class="italic">The Campaign of 1815</span> (1908).<br>
<br>Part of the conservative mainstream in military thinking as well as in politics, James's works contain some useful insights into war of the period, and are among many which disprove the myth that the armies of Europe had no conception of what awaited them in the First World War. He identified the impact on war made by improved railway and telegraph communications, and by the vastly increased size of armies. He also realized the strength given to the defensive by increased firepower and the increasing impossibility of successful frontal attacks. However, his solution, like that of most of his contemporaries, was to emphasize manoeuvre in the expectation that battle would become more, rather than less, decisive. His military thought, as expressed in <span class="italic">Modern Strategy</span>, inclines more towards the ideals of Jomini than of Clausewitz.<br>
<br>On 14 September 1914 James was recalled to active service from the reserve for the last time, fulfilling the role of a typical army &#145;dug-out&#146; officer by working as a general staff officer 2nd grade in the censor's department of the War Office. He retired on 31 May 1918, having reached the age limit. His main post-war achievement was in providing valuable assistance to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in preparing its <span class="italic">History of the War</span>.<br>
<br>The family home in later life was 6 St Mary's Mansions, London W2. A member of the Author's Club, James's other recreations were shooting and tennis. He died peacefully of old age on 13 January 1927 in a nursing home in Ealing and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 17 January. One of his sons followed him into the army, becoming Lieutenant-Colonel R. H. James.<br>
