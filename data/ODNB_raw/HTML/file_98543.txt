<span class="headword">Hodges, Sir  Lewis Macdonald <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>  (1918&#150;2007), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at 6 Ormond Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 1 March 1918, the son of Arthur Macdonald Hodges (1879&#150;1940), decorative artist and later antiques dealer, and his wife, Gladys Mildred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lewis (1891&#150;1975). He was educated at St Paul's Boys' School in Barnes and at the RAF College at Cranwell, which he entered in 1937. Known as Bob, he was commissioned into the RAF as a pilot officer in December 1938 and joined Bomber Command. Based at RAF Finningley in Yorkshire, he began flying Vickers Wellesleys with 78 squadron, moving to 49 squadron in 1940, flying Handley Page Hampdens.<br>
<br>Hodges's Hampden was damaged returning from a raid on Stettin on 4 September 1940 and he was forced to crash-land in Brittany. An eight-month sojourn on the run ensued. After setting fire to the plane Hodges and his air gunner (who had not heard the order to bale out) set off southwards to escape to Spain. With the help of farmers they reached Marseilles, where they were arrested by the Vichy authorities. Hodges managed to escape and stowed away on a cargo boat but was captured again in Oran and returned to Marseilles. Sent to the Vichy-controlled camp for British prisoners at St Hippolyte du Fort, near N&icirc;mes, he escaped for a second time and made his way to Perpignan and across the Pyrenees. Arrested by Spanish customs officials, he spent some weeks in the prison camp at Miranda de Ebro before the British embassy secured his release. He returned to England in June 1941 and rejoined 49 squadron. He was awarded the DFC in May 1942 for operations that included attacks in the English Channel on the German battlecruisers <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> in February 1942.<br>
<br>Later in 1942 Hodges was chosen by Wing-Commander Charles Pickard to join 161 squadron, based at RAF Tempsford, Bedfordshire, which was one of two squadrons detailed to support the Special Operations Executive on secret missions. Flying Halifax bombers, Hodges dropped agents and supplies all over occupied Europe. Awarded a bar to his DFC and promoted to commander of 161 squadron in May 1943, with the rank of squadron leader, he then flew Hudsons and Lysanders on six dangerous missions to pick up leading figures in the French resistance, landing on each occasion in remote and difficult places in rural France. Among the passengers he brought to Britain were two future French presidents, Vincent Auriol and Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterand. The former appointed him a commandeur of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1950; the latter advanced him to grand officier of the L&eacute;gion in 1988. In October 1943 he received the DSO.<br>
<br>Hodges attended the RAF Staff College in 1944 and was briefly attached to Bomber Command's operations staff. Selected to serve in the Far East as staff officer to Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, he requested a return to active duties after the death in action in Burma of his younger brother. It was another narrow escape, as Leigh-Mallory's plane and all its crew were lost over the Alps. Hodges then took command of 357 squadron at RAF Jessore near Calcutta in December 1944, flying four-engine Liberators, twin-engine Dakotas, and Lysanders. This was another special duties squadron supporting the Special Operations Executive, this time in Burma, with additional responsibilities assisting groups resisting Japanese occupation in Thailand and Malaya. The vast scale of these operations entailed sorties in Liberators of up to twenty hours. For his service in the Far East Hodges was awarded a bar to his DSO in October 1945.<br>
<br>After the war Hodges was a member of the directing staff at the staff college in Haifa and then joined the new Joint Services Staff College at Latimer in 1947. He was attached to the Air Ministry from 1949 to 1952 as staff officer to the deputy chief of air staff and then in the directorate of plans. He returned to Bomber Command in 1952 and commanded the team of three RAF Canberras that entered the London&#150;New Zealand air race in 1953: they finished fourth after engine trouble, but set a new London&#150;Colombo record in the process. On 17 June 1950, at St Saviour's Church, Walton Street, Chelsea, he married Elisabeth Mary Blackett (<i>b</i>. 1925), daughter of Geoffrey Herbert Blackett, stockbroker. They had two sons, David (<i>b</i>. 1952) and Nigel (<i>b</i>. 1955).<br>
<br>For the next two decades Hodges held a succession of highly responsible positions in the RAF and Air Ministry that took him to the very top of the service. From 1954 to 1959 he was involved in the development of Britain's V-bomber nuclear force. He began as chief instructor at the new operational training unit at Gaydon, training crews on Vickers Valiants. In 1956 he moved to command one of the largest RAF bases, at Marham, where the Valiants were being introduced in place of Canberras. He received there the two visiting Soviet leaders, Nikita Khrushchov and Nikolai Bulganin. He was promoted group captain in 1957 and appointed CBE the following year. After two years as assistant commandant at Cranwell between 1959 and 1961, now an air commodore, he was sent to Aden to oversee British air operations there. In 1963 he attended the Imperial Defence College, was promoted air vice-marshal and appointed CB, and was then posted to supreme headquarters, allied forces in Europe, as air executive to the nuclear deputy.<br>
<br>In 1965 Hodges returned to the Air Ministry as assistant chief of air staff (operations): for three years he was focused on the Indonesian emergency and the British withdrawal from Aden. In 1968 he was promoted air marshal and advanced to KCB. As commander-in-chief of air support command he was responsible for RAF transport aircraft worldwide for the next two years. Then in 1970 he became air member for personnel for three years, in which role he was involved in the reorganization of the RAF and reductions in its manpower. In 1971 he became air chief marshal. From 1973 to 1976 his final position was within NATO as deputy commander-in-chief, allied air forces, central Europe. During this final period of his career he was also air aide-de-camp to the queen.<br>
<br>After retiring from the RAF in 1976 Hodges was active in business and benevolence. He was a director of Pilkingtons from 1979 to 1983 and of the British United Provident Association (BUPA) from 1987. Active on behalf of the RAF Benevolent Fund&#151;he chaired its education committee from 1979 to 1986&#151;he was also president of the Royal Air Force Association from 1981 to 1984 and directed the successful refurbishment of the RAF Club in Piccadilly. Unsurprisingly he was especially committed to the RAF Escaping Society, a charity that gave assistance to those French who helped on the escape lines that conveyed aircrew out of occupied Europe, and to the Tempsford reunions, which brought together those who had been involved in the wartime Special Operations Executive operations from the base. A record of his wartime service was published in 1983 by the RAF Benevolent Fund in <span class="italic">Royal Air Force at War</span>. He retained a lifelong affection for France.<br>
<br>Bob Hodges died of a stroke at his home, Cob Orchard, Tree Lane, Plaxtol, near Sevenoaks, Kent, on 4 January 2007. He was survived by his wife and their two sons. A service of thanksgiving for his life was held at St Clement Danes, London, on 15 March 2007.<br>
