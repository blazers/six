<span class="headword">Atmore,  Charles</span>  (1759&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Methodist minister</span>, was born at Heacham, Norfolk, on 17 August 1759, the son of a ship's captain at King's Lynn. His mother died when he was eighteen months and he was brought up by an uncle and aunt and educated at the village school. At the age of fourteen he accompanied his father on a voyage to Rotterdam. He took up farm work at Haddiscoe, where in 1778 he heard his first Methodist preaching and became a Methodist in spite of opposition from his uncle and aunt, who were staunch Anglicans. Joseph Pilmore received him into membership in June 1779 and another of the Methodist itinerants, George Shadford, persuaded him to become a local preacher. On 14 February 1781 he met John Wesley in Norwich and was encouraged to continue preaching locally. At the conference of that year he was taken on as an itinerant and appointed to the Grimsby circuit, being received into full connection three years later. At the conference of 1786 he was ordained by Wesley for work in Scotland, where he became friends with Lady Maxwell and Dr John Gillies and built the first Methodist preaching-house in Glasgow. In 1787 he married Elizabeth Crane (<i>d</i>. 1794) of Preston, publishing a memoir of her after her death. He then married Harriet Chadwick (<i>d</i>. 1862) of Halifax in 1795; the couple had more than one child.<br>
<br>Wesley thought so highly of Atmore as to include him in the legal hundred: preachers named in the <span class="roman">Deed of Declaration</span> (1784), the document in which Wesley named the members of the conference who should inherit his powers of stationing preachers after his death and identify the legal conference should a schismatic conference appear. He thus became a member of the legally constituted Methodist conference in 1791. As one of the younger and more progressive ministers, he played an active part in the developments that followed Wesley's death, helping to shape the polity and ecclesiastical status of Methodism. Anticipating future decisions, he exercised the authority he believed to be his by virtue of his ordination by administering the sacrament to the Methodist society at Alnwick and joining with others in ordinations without conference authorization. His circuit ministry was exercised mainly in northern circuits. As superintendent of the Leeds circuit in 1811 he made the judicious purchase of what became the site of Woodhouse Grove School and in the same year was elected president of the conference. In 1813 he took the lead in establishing a district missionary society in Halifax to organize financial support for the overseas missions launched by Dr Thomas Coke. A close friend and confidant of the veteran preacher John Pawson, he corresponded extensively with him, and Pawson contributed much first-hand detail to Atmore's <span class="italic">Methodist Memorial</span> (1801; with an appendix on American Methodism, 1802), a series of short but informative biographies of early Methodist itinerants. He also published <span class="italic">Discourses on the Lord's Prayer</span> (1807) and edited new editions of <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span> and Oliver Heywood's <span class="italic">Family Altar</span>.<br>
<br>Atmore spent his closing days in London, dying on 1 July 1826 at a hotel run by his two eldest daughters in Fountain Court, Cheapside. He was buried in the graveyard of Wesley's City Road Chapel.<br>
