<span class="headword">Prowse,  William Jeffery</span>  (1836&#150;1870), <span class="occ">humorist</span>, was born at Torquay, Devon, on 6 May 1836, the son of Isaac Prowse (<i>d</i>. 1844) and his wife, Marianne Jeffery, who had known Keats and who had a volume of her poems published. Upon the death of his father in 1844, he was taken charge of by an uncle, John Sparke Prowse, a notary public and shipbroker, of Greenwich. At Greenwich he attended the school of Nicholas Wanostrocht, a well-known writer on cricket under the pseudonym of Nicholas Felix, who inspired him with his own enthusiasm for the game.<br>
<br>Prowse was from youth deeply interested in all forms of sport and was devoted to the sea. Before he was twenty he developed a talent for humorous verse, and soon drifted into journalism. About 1856 he obtained a position on the <span class="italic">Aylesbury News</span>, and in subsequent years he contributed tales, descriptive articles, and verses to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Lady's Companion</span>, the <span class="italic">National Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">The Porcupine</span>. In 1861 he was appointed a leader writer on the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, writing mainly on sporting topics. In 1865 his friend, Tom Hood the younger, became editor of <span class="italic">Fun</span>. Prowse contributed each week, under the signature of &#145;Nicholas&#146;, a rambling article on horse-racing, into which he introduced much good-humoured satire on other subjects.<br>
<br>In 1865 Prowse's health began to fail. He returned to Torquay, and passed the winters of 1867, 1868, and 1869 at Cimiez, near Nice. He died of tuberculosis at Cimiez on Easter Sunday 17 April 1870 and was buried in the protestant cemetery there. Prowse was known for his witty verse, the most famous example of which is his satire on Coleridge's &#145;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#146;. His &#145;The City of Prague&#146; has been described as &#145;a clever defense of Bohemianism&#146;  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 509), and his &#145;My Lost Old Age, by a Young Invalid&#146;, written in 1865, has been anthologized in collections of Victorian verse  (Burnham, 10).<br>
