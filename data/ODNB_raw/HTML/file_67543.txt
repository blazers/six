<span class="headword">Crooke,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1605&#150;1674), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was the son of William Crooke (<i>d</i>. in or before 1634), a husbandman of Kingston Blount in the Oxfordshire parish of Aston Rowant. He was apprenticed on 4 February 1622 to the London bookseller Roger Potts, himself the son of the clerk of Aston Rowant parish. Crooke was made free of the Stationers' Company on 26 March 1629 and was trading at &#145;the sign of Green Dragon&#146; by the following February; he would continue to operate under this sign for the rest of his life, first in St Paul's Churchyard and later, after the fire of London, &#145;without Temple Bar&#146;, by Devereux Court, in the Strand near Fleet Street. On 17 May 1630, in St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, Crooke married Susan Rancle, who was buried in St Faith's Church on 17 April 1646. At some point between 1649 and 1656 he married Elizabeth Needham (<i>d</i>. 1681), the widow of the London stationer Lawrence Needham.<br>
<br>Crooke rose in the hierarchy of the Stationers' Company. He took the livery on 5 March 1638, and on 26 March 1653 he was elected to the company's governing body. He served as under-warden for 1660&#150;61, as upper warden in 1663&#150;4, and for two successive terms as master (1665&#150;7). He also served on the city's common council as a representative of the ward of Farringdon Within for 1656&#150;7, 1659&#150;63, and 1667. As a bookseller, he chiefly sold plays, including ones by Jonson, and Beaumont and Fletcher. He published the first authorized edition of Sir Thomas Browne's <span class="italic">Religio medici</span>. In 1662 he is recorded as making a payment to the philosopher John Locke via an Oxford bookseller. Over his career, Crooke took a number of apprentices, the most notable being <a name="cosubject_67543"></a><span class="headword">William Crooke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1694)<span class="occ"></span>, who was not Andrew's son as is sometimes said, but was almost certainly his nephew. William had been baptized in Aston Rowant on 22 December 1639, the son of William Crooke, a yeoman. He was apprenticed to Andrew on 24 January 1656 and was freed on 2 November 1663. On 29 or 30 June of the latter year, William married Andrew's nineteen-year-old stepdaughter, Rebecca Needham (<i>b</i>. 1644), at St Benet Paul's Wharf. William set up independently in 1664 at the Three Bibles, Fleet Bridge; after the fire he rejoined his former master, now at Temple Bar, and traded there until his own death. A printed catalogue of Crooke's stock in 1675 included books of plays and poems, travel, gardening, physic, and law.<br>
<br>From 1637 until 1679 virtually all Thomas Hobbes's authorized publications in England were issued by either Andrew or William. Chief of these was <span class="italic">Leviathan</span>, whose bibliographical history is complex. Andrew entered it into the Stationers' register on 20 January 1651. Three imprints bear his name and the year 1651; today, these three are distinguished as the &#145;head&#146;, the &#145;bear&#146;, and the &#145;ornaments&#146; editions. The last two are reprints of the first edition, although they contain textual variants; it is probable that they were printed later but falsely dated. One clue in this is that the spelling in these two is more modern. Republication of <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> had been forbidden since the mid-1660s, and on 3 September 1668 Samuel Pepys reported that the book was selling at three or four times its original price of 8<i>s.</i> The &#145;bear&#146; edition may have been printed in the Netherlands, and it and the &#145;ornaments&#146; edition may date from the 1670s. Certainly, Andrew attempted a clandestine reprinting of the work in 1670 through his regular printer, John Redmayne, at whose printing house sheets were seized by the authorities on 6 October. The Stationers' Company records show a further &#145;damasking&#146; (defacing) of the printed sheets of <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> on 24 October 1674. When, on 22 February 1675, William assigned the rights of a number of books that had previously been entered by Andrew to John Wright, the company's court of assistants ordered that <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> was not to be entered in the company's register.<br>
<br>Hobbes's correspondence reveals much about Andrew Crooke, who evidently acted as the philosopher's man of business. Letters were addressed to Hobbes care of Andrew Crooke's shop from 1654 to 1671 (although sometimes by mistake to the bookshop of Andrew's brother John). In 1656 Fran&ccedil;ois du Verdus wrote to Crooke in Latin from Bordeaux to disconfirm a rumour that Hobbes was dead. In 1657 Hobbes got Crooke to send books to Samuel Fermat, the mathematician's son, at Paris. In the same year, Fran&ccedil;ois Peleau wrote that Crooke had sent him a letter in Latin: &#145;your bookseller is a learned man, but I think you make him partake of your own learning&#146;, probably meaning that Hobbes had dictated a letter that had gone over Crooke's name  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes</span>, 1.439). In 1659 Crooke sent copies of <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> and <span class="italic">De homine</span> to Charles du Bosc at the French court. In 1661 John Aubrey relied on Crooke to tell him when Hobbes would be in Derbyshire, and in 1667&#150;9 Pieter Blaeu, printer at Amsterdam, quarrelled with Crooke over earnings from Hobbes's books.<br>
<br>Andrew Crooke died intestate on 20 September 1674 and was buried in St Peter and St Paul Church in Aston Rowant on 29 September; a memorial tablet, erroneously giving his year of death as 1675, survives in the church floor. He left three daughters, and the administration of his estate was granted to his widow, Elizabeth, on 5 October 1674. An inventory of December 1674 gave the total value of his estate as &pound;2071 5<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., with debts of nearly &pound;5000 owing to him. The Stationers' Company appointed a committee to examine his accounts and decided in May that Elizabeth owed the company &pound;110. When she died in 1681, her estate was divided between three daughters from her previous marriage and one daughter surviving from her marriage to Andrew. Besides William, two of her sons-in-law also belonged to the book trade: Cassandra Needham had married the typefounder Thomas Grover, and Mary Crooke had married the typefounder Robert Andrews.<br>
<br>From 1673 William took over Andrew's role in helping Hobbes. In the following year he wrote to Anthony Wood about errors in the printing of an item by Hobbes; but the letter sounds very like Hobbes himself, and it is suspected that Hobbes dictated it to Crooke in the bookshop. In 1679 Hobbes wrote to Aubrey via Crooke, &#145;at whose shop I suppose you sometimes look in as you pass the street&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes</span>, 2.770). Four letters by Hobbes to Crooke from Chatsworth survive from 1679, one of them forbidding publication of <span class="italic">Behemoth</span>, of which a pirated edition had just appeared. Before that, however, Crooke had allowed people to read Hobbes's manuscripts in his shop and sold manuscript copies of them. In February 1673 Aubrey wrote to Locke about Hobbes's <span class="italic">Dialogue of the Common Laws</span>, saying,<blockquote>I never expect to see it printed, and intended to have a copy, which the bookseller will let me have for 50s &hellip; When you go by the Palsgrave-head Tavern be pleased to call on Mr W. Crooke at the Green Dragon and remember me to him &hellip; and he will show it to you. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Locke</span>, 1.375)</blockquote>Similarly, in 1678 the deist Charles Blount saw a manuscript copy of Hobbes's <span class="italic">Historical Narration Concerning Heresy</span> by &#145;Mr Crooke's favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes</span>, 2.759). As soon as Hobbes died in 1679 Crooke sought out his literary remains, and was sent Hobbes's prose autobiography. He consulted Charles Hatton about the worth of publishing it, and was reassured that it would have a market. In 1681&#150;2 he issued two volumes of Hobbes's tracts, including <span class="italic">Behemoth</span>; these contain prefaces by Crooke. When Aubrey was constructing his life of Hobbes, he had trouble sorting out Hobbes's bibliography: &#145;Dr Blackburn, W. Crooke, and I will lay our heads together to set these things right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.360). William Crooke died intestate in 1694. His second wife, <a name="cosubject_67208"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Crooke</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1696)<span class="occ"></span>, who may have been the Elizabeth Miskin who married a William Crooke in St James's, Duke's Place, on 31 May 1680, carried on his bookselling business for two years before selling up in 1696.<br>
<br>Two of Andrew's brothers were also apprenticed to members of the Stationers' Company. The younger of the two, Edmond, was baptized on 4 August 1616 at Aston Rowant and was bound on 3 March 1634 but never freed. However, he was active as a bookseller in Dublin, where he died in 1638. The elder, <a name="cosubject_67207"></a><span class="headword">John Crooke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1669)<span class="occ"></span>, was baptized in the same parish as Edmond on 5 September 1613. He was apprenticed on 26 March 1628 and freed on 6 April 1635. About 1637 he set up a bookselling partnership with his brother Edmond, Thomas Allot, and Richard Sergier in Dublin; he was also operating a bookshop in St Paul's Churchyard from 1638 onwards. He appears to have been in Dublin between 1642 and 1647 but, once back in London, he continued to issue Irish books throughout the 1650s. In 1652 he married Mary Tooke (<i>fl</i>. 1652&#150;1685), the sister of the bookseller Benjamin Tooke. In July 1660 he petitioned for and was granted the office of printer-general in Ireland; however, he does not seem to have returned permanently to Dublin. He died intestate in Duck Lane, London, on 20 March 1669; the administration of his English estate was granted to Mary a month later, while in Dublin administration was granted to his primary creditor. Although John was formally succeeded as king's printer by his brother-in-law Benjamin Tooke, Mary took over the business until 1684, in partnership with her sons John (<i>c</i>.1657&#150;1683), who shared the patent with Tooke from 1679 to 1683, and Andrew (<i>c</i>.1659&#150;1732). Andrew took over the business, and formally held the patent for king's printer in Ireland from 1689 to 1731.<br>
