<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Logier,  Johann Bernhard</span>  (1777&#150;1846), <span class="occ">music teacher and composer</span>, descended from a family of French refugees, was born on 9 February 1777 at Kassel in Hesse. His father and grandfather were musicians, and the former gave him his early musical education. About 1790 he travelled to England, and for two years played the flute and piano daily for an aristocratic patron. He then joined a regimental band conducted by John Willman, the father of the clarinettist Thomas Willman, with which he went to Ireland. In 1796 he married Willman's daughter, and took to composing for and teaching military bands and the piano. On the disbanding of his regiment in 1807 he first became organist of Westport, co. Mayo, then moved to Dublin, where he conducted the orchestra at Johnson's theatre, ran a music shop, and was soon recognized as the city's leading music teacher. Among his piano pupils was his own daughter; and it was for her use that Logier initially designed the apparatus for guiding a pianist's hands that was to gain him celebrity. Known as the &#145;chiroplast&#146;, it was meant to ensure a correct wrist and hand position in the teacher's absence. (For a full description and illustration, see Rainbow, 193&#150;4.)<br>
<br>Finding the device successful, Logier decided to use it for group teaching&#151;making several pupils, twelve or more, play at the same time on as many pianos. The system led to much controversy. Musicians in general were opposed to it, but Spohr expressed himself in its favour  (<span class="italic">Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</span>, 1820), and Samuel Webbe adopted it in London. Several hostile pamphlets and articles led to Logier inviting the Philharmonic Society and leading musicians to attend an examination of Webbe's pupils in London on 17 November 1817. The results of this examination are detailed in <span class="italic">An Authentic Account &hellip; by J. B. Logier</span> (1818), which was answered by <span class="italic">An Exposure of the New System &hellip; Published by a Committee of Professors in London</span> (1818). Many pamphlets followed.<br>
<br>In 1821 the Prussian government invited Logier to Berlin, where he established a chiroplast school with such good results that the king asked him to instruct twenty teachers to spread the system over the whole of Prussia. He remained for three years in Berlin, visiting England at intervals. By 1826 he had made enough money to retire. He settled near Dublin, where he died on 27 July 1846.<br>
<br>Logier arranged much music for the piano, and composed sonatas and other pieces, including an ode for the jubilee of George III, performed in Dublin. Several works were written especially for his peculiar system, and he was the author of sundry theoretical treatises and a <span class="italic">Complete Introduction to the Keyed Bugle</span>, an instrument he was said to have invented. He was not without a taint of charlatanism, establishing in Dublin a &#145;chiroplast club&#146;, with a special badge. He remarked to Mazzinghi that he &#145;considered himself an instrument in the hands of Providence for changing the whole system of musical instruction&#146;. These pretensions were extravagant, but what he did undoubtedly had a beneficial influence on piano teaching long after his system and invention were abandoned.<br>
