<span class="headword">Pickard, Sir  Robert Howson</span>  (1874&#150;1949), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 27 September 1874 at Balsall Heath, Birmingham, the elder of the two sons of Joseph Henry Pickard, a tool manufacturer, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Robert Howson, of Birmingham. From 1883 he attended King Edward VI's Grammar School, and from 1891 he was a student at the chemistry department of Mason College, Birmingham, which from 1894 was under the direction of P. F. Frankland. In 1895 he graduated BSc (London) with a first class in chemistry and in January 1896, as an 1851 Exhibition scholar, he proceeded to the University of Munich where he obtained the degree of PhD in 1898 <i>summa cum laude</i>. He then spent a year in Birmingham studying bacteriology and pursuing chemical research, before becoming head of the chemistry department of Blackburn Technical School in 1899; from 1908 to 1920 he was also principal of the school. During this period of twenty years Pickard published, with others, some thirty-five original papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>. An organic chemist, he specialized in stereochemistry; his original work on the relation between chemical constitution and optical activity was highly regarded by contemporaries, and in 1917 his research was recognized by his election as a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>During his stay in Blackburn, Pickard was occasionally consulted by cotton manufacturers, leading him to realize that there was much scope for the substitution of more scientific methods in place of the empirical and rule-of-thumb procedures operative in the industry. This experience probably laid the foundation for his lively interest in the cotton industry, as well as for the extensive technical knowledge that he gradually acquired.<br>
<br>In 1920 Pickard became principal of Battersea Polytechnic, and during his seven years' tenure did much to foster its educational facilities. During the same period he was director of the British Leather Manufacturers' Research Association, but his name is most closely associated with the directorship of the British Cotton Industry Research Association, known as the Shirley Institute, in Manchester, a post to which he was appointed in 1927 and in which he remained until 1943. He soon realized that the time was opportune for an intensive application of the scientific knowledge which had been accumulated by the association since its creation in 1919, and for the introduction of active measures to link the scientists more closely and effectively with industrial practices. In 1928 a liaison department was formed, and at the same time investigations, both fundamental and technological, were pursued on a steadily expanding scale. Large extensions of both laboratory and workroom accommodation were formally opened in 1936.<br>
<br>Pickard tackled with understanding the peculiar difficulties inherent in a research association connected with an industry divided into several distinct sections (for example, spinning, weaving, bleaching, and finishing), and realized that an important function was to envisage the industry as a whole rather than as a collection of component groups of firms with sectional interests and needs. His policy of co-ordination was well received, and by the time of his retirement the research association was recognized on all sides as an integral part of the textile industry. Pickard regarded his stay at the Shirley Institute as the most congenial and productive period of his career, and it certainly provided an opportunity for the full exercise of his organizational skills and highly developed critical faculty.<br>
<br>In 1901 Pickard married Ethel Marian (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of Henry Wood, provision merchant, of Edgbaston. They had one son and one daughter; the latter predeceased him. He was an active member of British scientific bodies and educational institutions. He served on the council of the Royal Society 1936&#150;8, was president of the Society of Chemical Industry, 1932&#150;3, and its medallist in 1941; vice-president of the Institute of Chemistry for many years, and its president, 1936&#150;9; vice-president of the Chemical Society for six years, and chairman of the Chemical Council, 1935&#150;8; and for several years chairman of the committee of directors of research associations. He was a member of the senate of the University of London for twenty-two years, a member of the court, 1937&#150;48, vice-chancellor, 1937&#150;9, chairman of convocation in 1948, and for several years chairman of the external council. He was also a member of the Surrey education committee and of the consultative committee of the Board of Education, and for eight years was chairman of the governing body of Roedean School. He was knighted in 1937. He died on 18 October 1949 at his son's home, Tumber House, in Headley, Surrey.<br>
