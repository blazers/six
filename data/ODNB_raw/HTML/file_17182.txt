<span class="headword">Lumley,  Richard</span>, first earl of Scarbrough  (1650&#150;1721), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of John Lumley (<i>d</i>. 1658) and his wife, Mary Compton (<i>d</i>. after 1667), daughter of Sir Henry Compton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17181/', "Richard Lumley, first Viscount Lumley of Waterford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66528/', "Lumley, Elizabeth")</script>] was his grandfather, and the army officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17177/', "Henry Lumley")</script> his younger brother. He was educated as a Roman Catholic and in October 1667 went overseas on the grand tour accompanied by his mother and the Roman Catholic divine Richard Lassels (Lascelles). A favourite of Charles II, he accompanied the duke of York to Scotland in 1679 before serving as a volunteer with the reinforcements sent to Tangier in 1680. From 11 September 1681 to 23 February 1682 he served as the earl of Feversham's replacement as master of the horse to Queen Catherine and may have held simultaneously a commission in the 1st troop of Life Guards. Having already succeeded to his grandfather's Irish title, on 31 May 1681 he was created Baron Lumley of Lumley Castle in the English peerage. On 25 October 1684 he replaced the earl of Clarendon as treasurer to Queen Catherine. He married Frances Jones (<i>c</i>.1665&#150;1722), daughter of Sir Henry Jones of Aston, Oxfordshire, on 17 March 1685 at St Giles-in-the-Fields.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of Monmouth's rebellion Lumley was commissioned to raise an independent troop of horse in Hampshire on 18 June 1685. Accompanied by cavalry from the Sussex militia, his men concentrated at Ringwood in Hampshire, whence patrols captured Lord Grey of Wark on 7 July and Monmouth himself on the following day. Lumley was appointed colonel of a new regiment of cavalry, the queen dowager's, on 31 July 1685, but was sacked in 1686 because of his opposition to the projected repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> and the penal laws. Converting to protestantism in 1687&#151;thereafter his politics were whig&#151;and piqued at his dismissal, he joined the conspiracy against James II in 1688, helped to organize the petition in support of the seven bishops, and signed the 30 June invitation to William of Orange to intervene militarily in England. Despite repeated orders for his arrest he secured Durham for the prince of Orange on 5 December before claiming Newcastle upon Tyne. During the Convention Parliament he strongly supported the contention that the throne was vacant. His rewards were considerable: he was made a privy councillor on 14 February 1689; a gentleman of the bedchamber on 23 February; colonel of the 1st troop of Life Guards on 2 April; and lord lieutenant of co. Durham and of Northumberland. He was created Viscount Lumley of Lumley Castle on 10 April 1689 and earl of Scarbrough five days later.<br>
<br>Scarbrough, a conscientious officer, crossed to Ireland with William III in 1690 and fought at the Boyne. Transferred to the Netherlands in 1691, he was promoted to major-general on 1 April 1692 and lieutenant-general on 4 October 1694. He left the army in 1699, selling his colonelcy of the Life Guards to the earl of Albemarle on 9 March. Queen Anne continued him in his appointments, including his membership of the privy council, and he was appointed a commissioner for the union with Scotland on 10 May 1706. Unlike most of his co-commissioners he took his responsibilities in this regard seriously. Although he lost his offices during the tory purge of 1712, he was reinstated by George I and readmitted to the privy council. On 21 November 1714 he was appointed to the court martial that adjudicated on the seniority of regiments and on 9 March 1716 became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Resigning the latter position in May 1717, he received in compensation the vice-treasurership of Ireland jointly with Matthew Ducie, later first Lord Ducie. He died at his home, Lumley Castle, of apoplexy on 17 December 1721 and was buried in Chester-le-Street. His widow, with whom he had seven sons and four daughters, and who had been a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Mary and to Queen Anne, died on 7 August 1722. His second but eldest surviving son and heir, Richard, was summoned to the House of Lords on 10 March 1714, installed as a knight of the Garter on 28 July 1724, appointed a privy councillor in 1727, and commissioned as a lieutenant-general in the army on 2 July 1739. He died by suicide, unmarried, on 29 January 1740.<br>
