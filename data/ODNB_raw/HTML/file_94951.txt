<span class="headword">Pant, Govind Ballabh</span>  (1887&#150;1961), <span class="occ">politician in India</span>, was born on 30 August 1887 at Khunt, Almora district, United Provinces, India, the son of Manorath Pant, a court official who rose to be a <i>naib tahsildar</i> (revenue collector), and his wife, Govindi. He was educated by private tutors at home and went to school at the age of ten. He passed his matriculation examination in the first division, but at the age of fourteen suffered a heart attack. His illness interrupted his studies and might have stunted his academic career altogether if he had not insisted on enrolling for further studies at Allahabad University. Because of his fragile health his family had been reluctant to send him away from home, but his health improved in Allahabad. He chose to study English literature, politics, and mathematics, which turned out to be an excellent combination for his future career in law and politics. In 1907 he joined the law college. As a student he was conscientious to a fault; even an occasional hour spent in gossip left him with feelings of guilt. He became an avid reader of newspapers, including Lucknow's British-owned <span class="italic">The Pioneer</span>. From his notebooks and diary from this time it is clear that he was thrilled by the visits of Congress leaders to Allahabad, such as those of B. G. Tilak and G. K. Gokhale. The most enduring influence on him was that of Gokhale, who was noted for his earnest study of problems and their articulation in measured language. When Gokhale died at the age of forty-eight in 1915 Pant wept.<br>
<br>Pant was married three times. His first two wives died in 1909 and 1914. In 1916 he married Kalawati, with whom he had one son, Krishna Chandra Pant (<i>b</i>. 1929), later a politician and government minister in independent India, and two daughters, Laxmi and Pushpa. On leaving Allahabad Pant started his legal practice at Almora, his home town, but he clashed with the local British magistrate and finally settled in Naini Tal, the summer capital of the United Provinces, where he made his mark at the local bar. He took an interest in social and educational reforms but was cautious in entering into active politics. He attended the historic session of the Indian National Congress at Lucknow in 1916, but did not join Mahatma Gandhi's non-co-operation movement against the British raj until January 1922, when Gandhi was poised to launch civil disobedience. Pant was ready to go to gaol, but following an outburst of popular violence in the eastern United Provinces Gandhi called off civil disobedience. The result was the collapse of the non-co-operation movement and the emergence of a group within the Congress&#151;the Swarajists&#151;led by Motilal Nehru and C. R. (Chittaranjan) Das, who called for the revocation of the Congress boycott of legislatures. This unexpected twist to nationalist politics opened new vistas for Pant's political career. He fought and won the election to the United Provinces legislative council on the Swarajist ticket. He caught the perceptive eye of Motilal Nehru, and thanks to his support was elected leader of the Congress party in the United Provinces council in preference to better-known Congress leaders from the province.<br>
<br>In 1928, during a demonstration at Lucknow against the Simon commission (which was charged with inquiring into a future constitution for India), Pant was severely beaten up by the police, which gave him lifelong back pain. His parliamentary career was in abeyance between 1929 and 1934 during the civil disobedience movement, when the Indian National Congress was outlawed and thousands of its members imprisoned. By a happy coincidence he was a fellow prisoner of Jawaharlal Nehru in Bareilly and Dehra Dun gaols in 1932. They hit it off very well. In his gaol diary Nehru described Pant as &#145;a lovable person&#146; and &#145;a brave, highly intelligent and absolutely straight man. Always in pain, yet always with a smile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru</span>, vol. 5, 1973, 364, 401). This close contact laid the foundation of their mutual esteem and loyalty which lasted until Pant's death. In 1934, when the Congress ended its boycott of legislatures and contested elections to the central legislative assembly, Pant was elected to it and made deputy leader of the Congress party. This marked his entry on the national political stage. His association with the Congress parliamentary board signified his rising political stature. His political acumen and debating skills won the appreciation of the highest leaders of the Congress, Gandhi, Nehru, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.<br>
<br>In 1937, after the provincial elections held under the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935, Pant became the chief minister of the United Provinces. He managed to win the confidence and co-operation of British members of the Indian Civil Service. Sir Harry Haig, the governor, wrote to the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, that Pant was &#145;an interesting and rather attractive personality&#146;, and &#145;essentially a conciliator and not a dictator&#146;  (Rau, 183, 184). However, the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 (and Linlithgow's declaration of Indian belligerence, without consulting Indian representatives) led to a clash between the British government and the Indian National Congress, and the resignation of the Congress provincial ministries. Neither the British cabinet, headed by Neville Chamberlain and later by Winston Churchill, nor the government of India, headed by Linlithgow, proved capable of the bold and imaginative stroke of policy needed to conciliate Indian nationalism. The crisis came to a head in 1942 with Gandhi's &#145;Quit India&#146; call to the British. Pant spent the next three years in Ahmednagar Fort along with other members of the Congress working committee. He was released in 1945, and after the election to the provincial legislatures ordered by the Labour government which came to power in 1945 again headed the Congress ministry in the United Provinces in 1946. A year later came the transfer of power and the end of British rule.<br>
<br>Pant's urgent task in 1947 was to save the United Provinces from the wave of communal bitterness and bloodshed which had swept over the whole of western Pakistan, eastern Punjab, and Delhi in the wake of the partition of the country. He was able to maintain relative peace in the United Provinces and thereafter to address himself to tasks of administrative and economic rehabilitation. His two years' experience as chief minister during 1937&#150;9 stood him in good stead. He made a concerted effort to foster the economic development of his province. He was an outstanding administrator, but did not build up a second line of leadership, which could have maintained the pace of economic progress initiated by him. Moreover, without his conciliatory presence, the Congress party in the United Provinces was rent with faction.<br>
<br>In 1950 the prime minister, Nehru, had offered Pant the post of finance minister in the union cabinet; but he was reluctant to leave his province (which he renamed Uttar Pradesh the same year). In 1954 he agreed to move to New Delhi and was given the important portfolio of home affairs. In 1957 he was awarded India's highest honour, the Bharat Ratna. As home minister Pant was a tower of strength to Nehru, especially in crises such as those created by the fierce controversies on the reorganization of the boundaries of the Indian provinces on a linguistic basis, which he handled with consummate skill. It was fortunate for him that in the formative stage of the Indian republic he was called on to fill the roles of a parliamentarian and administrator for which his talents, temperament, and experience had best equipped him. He died, while still in office, on 7 March 1961, in New Delhi, following a stroke. Several institutions were named after him, including the Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, the Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, Allahabad, and the Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital, New Delhi.<br>
