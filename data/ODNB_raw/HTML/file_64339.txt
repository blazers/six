<span class="headword">Fleetwood,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">theatre manager</span>, was the only son of Thomas Fleetwood of Gerard's Bromley in Staffordshire and Frances Gerard, the sister of Charles, sixth Baron Gerard. At the age of twenty-one he inherited (from Lord Gerard, through his mother) a landed estate valued at &pound;6000 per annum. Described by Benjamin Victor as &#145;agreeable in his person&#146; and &#145;affable and engaging in his address&#146;  (Victor, 1.33&#150;4), the young Fleetwood enjoyed a highly extravagant lifestyle. His reputation for improvidence soon attracted the attention of a circle of gamblers, however, who quickly relieved him of his fortune. With his inheritance all but gone, he hit upon the idea of venturing into the theatre, and in the spring of 1734 he purchased John Highmore's share of the Drury Lane theatre patent. Knowing nothing of the mechanics of the stage, he appointed the actor Charles Macklin to take charge of his fellow players and supervise the artistic business of the theatre.<br>
<br>With Fleetwood overseeing the financial management of Drury Lane, the theatre thrived for several years. However, by the 1737&#150;8 season Fleetwood appears to have grown tired of his day-to-day involvement. Leaving his treasurer, Pierson, in charge of financial affairs, he devoted his time to less salubrious amusements. In 1739 he began to referee boxing matches at Tottenham Court. He simultaneously renewed his passion for gambling, to which he devoted large sums of money taken from the profits at Drury Lane. Without the necessary funds for fresh scenes and costumes, the theatre suffered. Fleetwood responded by introducing a series of novelty acts, including physical freaks and rope-dancers, but their appearance served only to diminish box-office receipts still further.<br>
<br>Following the great success of Garrick's d&eacute;but season at Goodman's Fields in 1741&#150;2, Fleetwood brought the young star to Drury Lane with an offer of &pound;500 per year. However, his continuing abuse of the minor company actors, to whom he refused to grant a benefit night, soon prompted a rebellion among the players. In 1743 the leading actors formed a union and vowed that not one of them would agree individual terms with Fleetwood unless the other members of the company were satisfied with their own salaries. The manager responded by gathering together an alternative company of players, drawn principally from Giffard's disbanded troupe at Lincoln's Inn Fields. After several months of financial hardship, the majority of the rebels chose to make their peace with Fleetwood. However, despite a number of economies, the theatre continued to struggle. In a desperate attempt to raise money Fleetwood mortgaged the Drury Lane patent, and offered the theatre's store of costumes and props as security against a further &pound;7000 loan.<br>
<br>On 17 November 1744 Fleetwood's decision to raise ticket prices provoked a riot among the audience, which the manager sought to quell by sending a number of men into the theatre armed with wooden clubs. A repetition of this incident, witnessed by Horace Walpole, appears to have sealed Fleetwood's disenchantment with the stage. In December 1744 he sold the Drury Lane patent to Richard Green and Morton Amber, who offered him a lump sum of &pound;3200 and an additional annuity of &pound;600.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1745 Fleetwood, suffering from &#145;excessive Gout&#146;  (Victor, 1.62), moved to France. He died, apparently bankrupt, at Chalon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne in August 1747. He was survived by his wife, the actress and dancer Susanna Fleetwood, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams (<i>b</i>. 1714). They had two sons, Charles and John Gerard, both actors. The younger Charles Fleetwood made his London d&eacute;but in 1758, and spent two seasons at Drury Lane before moving to the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. He soon gave up the stage, however, and in 1769 emigrated to the East Indies; he died in 1784. John Gerard Fleetwood, the younger of the two brothers, made his first appearance at Covent Garden in April 1769. He then spent a season at the Haymarket before moving to Edinburgh in 1771. In 1773 he joined Tate Wilkinson's company at York, where he performed for three seasons. He died in Leeds in 1776.<br>
