<span class="headword">Hutchins,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Harry Hutchens]</span>  (1857&#150;1939), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born at Alpha Place, Putney, Surrey, on 27 February 1857, the third son in the family of three sons and three daughters of James Hutchins (1817/18&#150;1856), a journeyman stonemason, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harper (1816/17&#150;1880). His father died before he was born, and his widowed mother worked as a charwoman. As a boy he was said to have delivered newspapers in Putney, but he became a clerk, and was described as such, living in Wimbledon, when he married, at Hammersmith on 3 March 1880, Harriett (1858&#150;1930), daughter of James Scotcher, corn merchant, of Guestling, Sussex. They had a daughter, Hilda (1881&#150;1952).<br>
<br>Known as Harry Hutchens, he competed mostly in handicaps at the main centres for professional meetings, Sheffield and Edinburgh. He was a &#145;marked man&#146; from the time he won a Sheffield handicap in 1878, but running off scratch he won there in 1879, 1882, and 1891. Handicapped severely, he never won the 120 yards at the new year gala meeting at Powderhall, Edinburgh, regarded as the blue riband event for professionals. Indeed, Hutchins's reputation was to some extent based on what people thought he could have achieved if he had run flat out more often than he did, for he sometimes found it more profitable to lose races he might well have won.<br>
<br>Having run in America in 1884, in Australia in 1886 Hutchins beat the expatriate Irishman Tom Malone in a three-race series, then lost twice to Charles Samuels, an Aborigine. He beat Samuels so decisively in a third race, however, it seemed likely, as was claimed, that he deliberately lost the first two. In Melbourne on 29 January 1887 he ran 100 yards in 9.75 seconds. On 13 September 1887 he was involved in a fiasco that virtually ended the claim of professional races to be genuinely competitive. At Lillie Bridge Stadium, London, he was due to meet Harry Gent of Stockton over 120 yards. With several thousand spectators present, the race was cancelled at the last moment because their backers could not agree which runner should lose the race. The crowd rioted and burnt down the grandstand.<br>
<br>Hutchins's fame, however, spanned several generations, and people who had not seen him run repeated the clich&eacute; of those who had: that he was the finest sprinter who ever lived. Three examples of performances when he was apparently moving at top speed show that he was very fast by any standard: 131 yards (120 metres) in 12.4 seconds, and 50 yards in 4.5. He always used a standing start, and was still competing and starting off scratch in his late thirties. At Paisley, a month before his thirty-seventh birthday, he was timed at 11.8 seconds for 120 yards and 21.8 for 220. By 1901 he was employed as a foreman at the Royal Naval Ordnance Depot, Woolwich. Hutchins, described as a &#145;professional athlete (retired)&#146;, died at 134 Brookdale Road, Catford, London, on 2 January 1939, fifty-five years to the day after he had covered 300 yards in 30 seconds on a cold winter's day in Edinburgh, a performance that still impresses historians of athletics.<br>
