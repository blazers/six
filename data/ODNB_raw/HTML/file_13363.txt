<span class="headword">Hirschell <span class="st"> [Hirschel, Herschell]</span>,  Solomon</span>  (1762&#150;1842), <span class="occ">chief rabbi</span>, was born in London on 12 February 1762 (not 1761 as often cited). He was the third and youngest son (there were also three daughters) of Polish-born Hirsch Lewin (1721&#150;1800), who as rabbi of the Great Synagogue, Duke's Place, London, from 1754 to 1764 was generally known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17275/', "Hart Lyon")</script>, and his wife, Golda (<i>d</i>. 1794), daughter of David Tevele Cohen, a leader of the Jewish community of Glogau, Silesia. On his father's side Solomon Hirschell (as he spelled his name, which also appears as Hirschel or Herschell) came of a long line of continental rabbis, some extremely eminent. In early life he was known as Solomon Hart. His formative years were spent in the German states, for in 1764 his father became rabbi of Halberstadt, accepting a call to Mannheim in 1770 and in 1773 to Berlin. Sent to Poland for a traditional Jewish education, and becoming an able Talmudic scholar, Solomon Hirschell toyed with the idea of becoming a wine merchant before embarking on a rabbinic career and taking up a position at Prenzlau, Prussia. In 1791 he offered himself for the vacancy at the Great Synagogue occasioned by the death of his father's successor there, Rabbi David Tevele Schiff, but for economic reasons the congregation made no appointment until 1802, when Hirschell was comfortably elected to the post from a shortlist of three. His British birth helped his case, yet he never mastered the English language, relying on certain congregants when he needed to communicate with the secular authorities. His habitual vehicle was Yiddish. A few of his sermons, notably one giving thanks for the British victory at Trafalgar, were translated into English and appeared in print.<br>
<br>Hirschell married, about 1778, a distant cousin, Rebecca K&ouml;nigsberger (<i>d</i>. 1832). The couple had four sons, David Tevele, Saul, Ephraim, and Hirsch, and four daughters, Golda, Rosa, Feiga (known as Fanny), and Shayndel (known as Jeanette). Apparently despairing of the comparatively lax Jewish observance in London, he sent his children to live in Poland as soon as they reached marriageable age, and consequently left no descendants in Britain. Two of his sons eventually settled in Jerusalem, where the eldest, Rabbi David Tevele Hirschell (or Berliner), was murdered in 1851.<br>
<br>By the time of Hirschell's appointment the Ashkenazi Jews of Britain significantly outnumbered their Sephardi counterparts, and their three synagogues in London had begun to co-operate with each other on such matters as charitable relief. This trend led to Hirschell, as rabbi of the senior and largest Ashkenazi congregation, being regarded as their natural spokesman, and his authority steadily increased in range. All queries regarding Jewish law and procedure, from Ashkenazi congregations and individuals in Britain as well as in the colonies, came to be directed to him, and he thus became the first chief rabbi of the British empire. He was widely dubbed, in the general press, the &#145;high priest&#146; of Anglo-Jewry. The designation Doctor, which was used by him from the outset of his career in Britain, was an honorific, presumably adopted to enhance the dignity of his office.<br>
<br>Hirschell's incumbency coincided with several noteworthy developments. There was an upsurge in millenarianism and consequently in missionary activity, with Hirschell vigorously condemning the activities of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews, founded in 1809. There was, too, a burgeoning genuine philosemitism on the part of influential Britons; a highlight of Hirschell's ministry was a visit to a service at the Great Synagogue that same year by three pro-Jewish sons of George III. In 1827 the Post Office demonstrated its goodwill by quite extraordinarily waiving all postage due on unstamped letters to impecunious Jews in England from friends and relatives in Russia and Poland which were arriving care of Hirschell in ever-increasing numbers and whose cost he would otherwise have continued to bear. The closing years of his life were marked by failing health and by crisis and controversy, such as the trumped-up ritual murder accusation against Damascus Jewry in 1840, about which he issued a public statement, and the formation that same year of a Reform congregation in London, which aggravated him and made him weary of the rabbinate. As a single-minded, inflexible rabbi of the old eastern European type, he could not accommodate demands for change and found himself out of his depth; his successor in office was the moderate and sophisticated Nathan Marcus Adler, who had enjoyed a secular university education.<br>
<br>In 1840 Hirschell fell and broke his thigh, a mishap which sapped his spirit. Two years later he fell again, breaking his collarbone. He died shortly afterwards, on 31 October 1842, at his long-time residence, 5 Bury Court, St Mary Axe, in the City of London. He was buried on 2 November at Mile End, many non-Jewish as well as Jewish shops in the area closing as a mark of respect. A frugal lifestyle and prudent investments enabled him to leave &pound;14,000 in addition to a library of Hebraica, which was acquired by the London Bet Hamidrash (&#145;house of study&#146;), and a Judaica collection which was auctioned. In accordance with his wishes, his personal papers were destroyed at his death.<br>
<br>Hirschell penned no significant writings and made no pastoral visits to congregations outside London except Portsmouth's. Yet he had loyal admirers both within and without the Jewish community; the latter included the eminent Dublin Hebraist James Henthorn Dodd (1805&#150;1869) and Henry Hawkes, a staunchly philosemitic Unitarian minister in Portsmouth, both of whom paid public tribute to Hirschell on his death. Hawkes's address was subsequently published as a pamphlet advocating Jewish emancipation. A medal in Hirschell's memory, bearing his likeness on one side, was commissioned in 1844 from City of London jeweller Henry Hyams; forty were struck, symbolizing the number of years he held office.<br>
