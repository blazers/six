<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devereux,  Robert</span>, third earl of Essex  (1591&#150;1646), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was born on 11 January 1591 at Walsingham House in Hart Street, London, and baptized there in the chapel on 22 January by Lancelot Andrewes. He was the first-born son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7565/', "Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex")</script> and stormy petrel of late Elizabethan politics (1565&#150;1601), and his wife, Frances (1567&#150;1632), daughter of Elizabeth's puritan secretary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Sir Francis Walsingham")</script>, and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25522/', "Sir Philip Sidney")</script>, the protestant poet and military hero. Essex grew up in a profoundly dysfunctional family. His father hardly ever saw him, being either on military campaign against the Spaniards or the Catholic Irish, or on political campaign against his detractors at court. He had five more children with Frances&#151;although only one son and two daughters survived infancy&#151;yet he and his countess led largely separate lives and both had lovers. Frances&#151;who had married both Sidney and Devereux without the queen's knowledge or consent&#151;was banned from court. Then in 1601 the second earl was beheaded for rebellion and treason. With indecent haste the countess married her lover <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67043/', "Richard Burke (or de Burgh), fourth earl of Clanricarde")</script>, and decamped for the west of Ireland. Robert was suddenly stripped of his parents, his title, and his wealth. He was sent to Eton College to study under the ascetic protestant humanist Henry Savile. (He subsequently transferred in 1602 with him to Oxford, living with him in the warden's lodge at Merton College.) At twelve he was a penniless, escheated orphan.<h2>
<a name="Afailedapprenticeshipatcourt16031619"></a>A failed apprenticeship at court, 1603&#150;1619</h2>Devereux's fortunes were transformed by the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne. James immediately showed that he remembered fondly the loyalty to his reversionary right shown by the second earl of Essex. The young Robert Devereux was invited to bear James's sword before him as he entered London at the end of April 1603 and at his coronation on 25 July. James proceeded to restore him to his titles&#151;Baron Bourchier, Viscount Hereford, and earl of Essex&#151;and to his estates and made him a page to Prince Henry. A succession of token honours (such as an Oxford MA <i>honoris causa</i> conferred simultaneously on Robert Cecil's son and heir and on Essex in August 1605) marked him out as a man of promise, and the Howards, earls of Suffolk and Nottingham, insecure in their dominant position at court, were keen to take advantage of this. They persuaded the king to sponsor a marriage between the Devereux and Howard families. On 5 January 1606 Robert, not yet fifteen, was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53028/', "Frances Howard (1590&#150;1632)")</script>, Suffolk's daughter, herself only eight months his elder. Cohabitation at that age was out of the question, and so Robert was sent on a 21-month grand tour (1607&#150;9), albeit one restricted to France and the Netherlands. He returned just before his eighteenth birthday to begin married life. His wife was now a noted beauty, and strong rumours linked her to the amorous attentions of Prince Henry and of the king's new favourite Robert Carr. A severe bout of smallpox, which left Essex badly scarred, was untimely. The relationship of husband and wife quickly became, first from her side and then from his, one of bitter distaste. He felt a sense of duty to his line to have heirs and persisted in seeking a sexual dimension to a loveless match. She lacked his willingness to make the best of a bad job.<br>
<br>Essex had an equally trying return to court life. In 1610 and 1611 he fell out with Prince Henry and hit him with a tennis racquet after the prince called him the son of a traitor, drawing blood. Then a card game in his chambers at Whitehall led to a brawl and a duel, in which he was not a principal but became involved. In 1612 he fought and wounded William Herbert, earl of Montgomery, during an argument while they were hunting with the king at Woodstock. He was clearly a very insecure young man. After this he took Frances to Chartley, his favourite house in the midlands, in a determined attempt to secure an heir. The countess sulked and refused his attentions. It later became clear that her first attempt to poison him occurred at this time. When they returned to court she all too publicly took up a sexual liaison with Carr, now earl of Somerset.<br>
<br>A public cuckold with thin skin and a pock-marked face, Essex had lost all prospects at court. With the death of Prince Henry and the inexorable rise of his estranged wife's family Essex faced a bleak future. And it quickly got worse. In 1613 the Howards persuaded the king to establish a commission to grant Frances an annulment of her marriage on the ground of her husband's impotence. Some members of the commission treated with contempt the long-drawn-out process, with dozens of witnesses and a stark statement by Essex himself that:<blockquote>he hath found an ability of body to know any other woman, and hath oftentimes felt motions and provocations of the flesh &hellip; but that he hath lain by the lady Frances two or three years last past, and hath no motion to know her, and he believes never shall. (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 2.787)</blockquote>After the king had appointed additional and compliant judges the inevitable decree was granted to Frances on 25 September 1613. To twist the knife in the wound the judicial commission ordered Essex to return Frances's dowry. And if the humiliation of that&#151;and the proliferation of salacious manuscript accounts of it all&#151;was not enough Essex was briefly imprisoned for attempting to fight a duel with Charles Howard, his brother-in-law, after the latter had mocked his honour and his manhood.<br>
<br>Shortly after this Essex took his seat in the parliament of 1614, and unsurprisingly sided with the earl of Southampton in criticism of the crown over impositions and of royal ministers like Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Thomas Parry, and Bishop Richard Neile for overreaching themselves. One newsletter writer spoke of the king as being &#145;very angry&#146; with many of the peers: Essex was named second after Southampton  (Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 77).<br>
<br>Essex then retreated to his estates at Chartley, Staffordshire, and remained there for five years, except for a brief visit to London to observe the trial and conviction of his former wife and her new husband for having murdered Sir Thomas Overbury as a lethal by-product of their plots against him. Otherwise he discharged faithfully his duties as a lord lieutenant of Staffordshire and busied himself with the marriages of his sisters. It is noteworthy that when James passed within a mile or two of Chartley on his return journey from Scotland in 1617 he did not call. Essex did however return to London for the funeral of James's queen, Anne of Denmark, in 1619. While he was there the elector palatine, Frederick V, called for volunteers to assist him to secure the throne of Bohemia. Essex immediately agreed to lead 300 men and raised them easily.<h2>
<a name="Asuccessfulapprenticeshipinwar16191624"></a>A successful apprenticeship in war, 1619&#150;1624</h2>In every year from 1620 to 1624 Essex served in protestant armies in the Rhineland. His experience was one of stalemate alternating with defeat. Thus he served in 1620 under Sir Horace Vere, when he and his fellows were toyed with by the wily Spinola. A game of cat and mouse lasted until heavy frost, starvation, and demoralization caused the campaign to be abandoned. James now called on him to join his council of war for the recovery of the palatinate, and over a five-week period in January and February 1621 Essex took part in drawing up a plan involving the deployment of 20,000 foot and 5000 horse at a cost of &pound;900,000. This proposal was rejected by the king, but James continued to look for volunteers to assist Frederick, and in each of the four summers from 1621 Essex raised men and took them to join the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau. Every time he returned to England he personally led appeals for volunteers, and on each occasion sufficient men answered the call in quick time. His limited self-esteem was bolstered by this evidence of the prestige of, and trust in, his name.<br>
<br>Every summer Essex crossed to the Low Countries. Every summer there was frustration and privation, and then each winter he returned home with his sense of the messiness of war further reinforced. In 1621 he spent the second half of the year entrenched around the small town of Rees in Cleves, seeing little action. Neither Prince Maurice of Nassau nor Spinola made any headway. Disease was the only winner. In 1622 he again served as a colonel under Maurice in the same Rhineland stalemate. In 1623 Essex and his men were part of a strong defensive force in Arnheim, the capital of Nassau, anticipating an assault from the imperial general John Tzerklaes, Count Tilly. But Tilly was deflected and the assault never came. Essex had seen no significant action, but had won the respect of his men. In his encomium on Essex published at his death Robert Codrington wrote: &#145;he first trailed a pike and refused no service in the field which every ordinary gentleman is accustomed to perform. This did much to endear him to his soldiers, and his liberality and humanity did the more advance him&#146;  (Codrington, 9). There is a ring of truth to this. It fits in with his demonstrable practice in England when war broke out in 1642.<br>
<br>In 1624 Essex saw rather more action. James I committed himself to raising four regiments each of 1500 men and commissioned the grumblers in the House of Lords&#151;the earls of Essex, Oxford, and Southampton&#151;as colonels of three of them. Once more Essex was the first to raise his men: &#145;his name still possessed magnetic qualities&#146;  (Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 119). By late August all four regiments were in The Hague, where they joined up with 4000 Dutch troops. Their assignment was the relief of the siege of Breda. Since they were heavily outnumbered by Spinola's men this was to be achieved by harrying the latter's supply lines and picking off convoys. Something, but in truth very little, was gained by these manoeuvres; and disease carried off many of the English, including both Southampton and his son Lord Wriothesley. This time, Essex stayed on over the winter and right through to the final surrender of Breda on 4 June 1625. He thus played no part in the obsequies for James VI and I, who had died on 27 March. He returned, flushed with defeat, to find a new and more hostile atmosphere at court.<br>
<br>Essex's military apprenticeship had one final humiliation to endure. Charles I and the duke of Buckingham were determined to take the war of honour against the king of Spain into his own heartland. They planned to repeat the great triumph won by Essex's father at Cadiz in 1596. Thirty years on his son was a key player in a repeat performance. The third earl was named as vice-admiral under Sir Edward Cecil, with personal command of a whole squadron and the command of a regiment of foot. It was to be the greatest ever English armada, comprising almost a hundred vessels and some 15,000 fighting men. But it was a disaster. The fleet sailed too close to the shoreline and was spotted, ruining the element of surprise. There were then delays, problems in ensuring all the captains had the same instructions, poor co-ordination (this cost Essex dear), and very inadequate leadership by all those with whom Essex had to work. The Spaniards were able to block the entrance to the harbour and ward off an attempted direct assault and several attempts to take outlying defences. The one success was ruined when Cecil's men got drunk on plundered wine. Savage autumn storms disrupted any further action. The fleet limped home. Only six vessels were lost, but many more were severely damaged. Half the men were dead, booty was small, and the whole sorry expedition cost more than &pound;300,000 (the equivalent of five parliamentary subsidies). Nobody blamed Essex for the catastrophe. But the men he knew to be guilty of failed and incompetent leadership&#151;the duke of Buckingham and Sir Edward Cecil (grandson of Lord Burghley and therefore a scion of the family that was the second earl's nemesis)&#151;were exonerated in a conciliar cover-up. Cecil was even rewarded by a peerage, and not just a peerage, but a viscountcy (of Wimbledon).<br>
<br>Essex's military achievements in the 1620s were therefore modest. From them he learned that outright victory was rarely attainable and the cost in human life was high. It made him a negative and reactive commander, which helps to explain his failings in the civil wars. In addition it reinforced his estrangement from the political establishment. As he accumulated experience he anticipated recognition and promotion. But royal distrust always kept him in a subordinate position. When the king offered the command of an expeditionary force to assist the king of Denmark in 1627 to junior members of the English and then the Scottish peerage and then to a commoner&#151;Colonel Sir Charles Morgan&#151;Essex resigned his commission in disgust (&#145;being offended and not without reason&#146; as the Venetian ambassador noted; <span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1626&#150;8</i>, 62). He had overreacted to slights on his honour before, and did so throughout his life. But at the same time he had received the constant reassurance that his men revered him. Every year he had to recruit new men, and his name caused his regiments to fill immediately. He was a good commander, showing concern and compassion for his men, and they followed him loyally. It was balm to his damaged self-esteem that away from court and from the sneers of courtiers he was recognized as the scion of a great house.<h2>
<a name="Politicalapprenticeship16211629"></a>Political apprenticeship, 1621&#150;1629</h2>Whenever parliament was in session in the 1620s Essex was its most assiduous attender. He hardly missed a day, and he hardly ever spoke. As his secretary, Arthur Wilson, put it: &#145;he had an honest heart, and though nature had not given him eloquence, he had a strong reason that did express him better&#146;  (A. Wilson, <span class="italic">The History of Great Britain being the Life and Reign of King James the First</span>, 1653, 162). He was more comfortable on committees and in small groups drafting reports, and soon became an inveterate member of the grand committees of privileges and of petitions. In every parliament he was a thorn in the royal flesh, stubbornly defending the honour of the house and consistently supporting parliamentary investigation of the ministers upon whom the monarch most relied. In 1621 he led a protest against the Scottish invasion of the English peerage and took a taciturn but relentless part in the Lords investigation of three royal ministers accused of corruption: the lord chancellor, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Henry Yelverton, and Sir John Bennet. In 1624 he took up a number of privilege cases, including the freedom from arrest during the session of his own chaplain William Hulbocke, and was restrained but unrelenting in the house's investigations of the lord treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex. He was present but unobtrusive in 1625, but in 1626, following the fiasco of the Cadiz expedition, he was prominent in defending the rights of peers to be free from arrest even on a direct order from the king, and in the escalating crisis that began with the duke of Buckingham and the earl of Bristol accusing each other of treason and ended in the impeachment of the former. For Essex there was no doubt, as far as the Cadiz fiasco was concerned, that the buck stopped with Buckingham. Although&#151;unlike the earls of Bristol and Arundel&#151;he was not arrested for his part in these events, it was at this point that Charles denied him the command of the expeditionary force that was to assist the king of Denmark. This ended his continental soldiering and brought him home in a malcontent mood. In 1627 he was one of those who not only refused the forced loan, but made his refusal public. His name appears at the head of a list of fifteen &#145;refractory lords&#146;&#151;ahead of the earls of Warwick, Lincoln, Bolingbroke, and Clare, and Viscount Saye and Sele  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1625&#150;6</i>, 485). A proposal for their imprisonment was debated in the privy council, but no action was taken. In spring 1627 he was invited to lead a regiment in the La Rochelle expedition, but declined to do so and retreated rather sulkily to Chartley.<br>
<br>When Charles's third parliament met in 1628 Essex followed his usual course. He attended almost every day and was appointed to and attended the grand committees of privileges and of petitions; he spoke little but used his taciturn influence in the lobbies. Once again he was ultra-sensitive on matters relating to the honour of individual peers and the privileges of the House of Lords. He played a leading part in the attempted impeachment of Roger Manwaring, a preacher who had published two sermons in which he had defended the king's right to require payment of the forced loan and in which he had castigated the &#145;refusers&#146; like Essex. Essex was the first to respond to John Pym's demand for a Lords investigation and he (with Bishop John Williams) was deputed to interrogate the printer of Manwaring's two pamphlets. During the great debates that led to the petition of right &#145;Essex sided with Saye but said little. He did however engage in some significant parliamentary manoeuvres&#146;  (Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 170&#150;71), such as moving to transfer discussion into a committee of the whole house to allow opponents to speak as often as they wished. When parliament was prorogued Essex returned to the country until it reconvened on 20 January 1629. Again he was the most assiduous attender, missing only one day, and he was appointed to the committee that drew up the petition for the redress of grievance.<br>
<br>By 1629 Essex was seriously malcontent. He resented the slights he had received from the king, he had a visceral dislike of (the now dead) Buckingham, and he had been sickened by the way the king had protected Buckingham and those who fawned upon him. He was ashamed at the incompetence and maladministration that had caused the failure of one attempt after another to further the protestant cause on the continent. He had supported, quietly but resolutely, every attempt of successive parliaments to remonstrate with the king about these matters. He (rightly) discerned that as far as King Charles was concerned he represented a bad smell on the margins of the court.<h2>
<a name="Thepersonalrule"></a>The personal rule</h2>Throughout the decade from 1629 Essex remained in the country and concentrated on his estates and on family matters. The death of both his grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8159/', "Lettice Dudley, countess of Leicester")</script>, and his mother brought their jointures back to him, more than doubling his annual income, from &pound;3000 to &pound;7000, placing him in the upper middle range of aristocracy. The coalmines at Merevale, Warwickshire, promised further long-term enhancements. In 1633 he travelled to Ireland to view and arrange the management of the Irish estates that had come back to him. He was welcomed into Dublin with a formal progress that exceeded that afforded to the lord deputy, Sir Thomas Wentworth, a few weeks later. It reminded him that his family name still carried a great weight. He leased out Essex House in the Strand to his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25182/', "William Seymour, earl of Hertford")</script>, for a large sum that cleared his debts (he retained the use of one wing).<br>
<br>But Essex also contracted a disastrous second marriage. At the end of the 1629 parliament he sought out Bishop John Williams and consulted him about the morality of remarriage during the lifetime of his first wife. If she had been given a divorce on the grounds of his impotence, and he was not impotent, how would God view the status of that union? Williams declared him free to remarry, and in some haste Essex married, on 11 March 1630, a notable beauty he had met at the home of his sister Frances, countess of Hertford. She was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1656), the daughter of Sir William Paulet, a bastard son of the marquess of Winchester.<br>
<br>For a while all went well. Essex became more cheerful and sociable. He entertained regularly and spent much time with his relatives&#151;he hunted with Hertford in Wiltshire, and played bowls with his popish half-brother Clanricarde in Kent. He played backgammon and cards with family members. He took on a librarian and began to accumulate a fine library. He became an aficionado of the spa towns. He avoided, mentally as much as physically, the court. He tried to become the model rural aristocrat. But new tragedy lay just round the corner. His second marriage collapsed, less spectacularly but just as cruelly as his first marriage had done. By 1636 he and Elizabeth were living largely separate lives, and she was implicated in an adulterous relationship with Sir William Uvedale, an unctuous courtier and treasurer of the king's chamber, the epitome of all that Essex despised. Rumours of the adultery became significant when the countess became pregnant, and the situation had its farcical side, with Essex's brother, Walter, spending long hours on a rickety ladder peering through bedroom windows. Consulting his calendar Essex announced that if she gave birth before 5 November 1636 he would own the child; if after 5 November, he would disown child and countess. Polite society took sides and placed bets. Once more Essex was the butt of humiliating humour. The baby duly arrived on 5 November itself. Essex bit the bullet, owned the child, and forgave the countess. And then, a month later, the infant, Viscount Hereford, succumbed to plague. Essex retreated into a deeper bitterness and despair. Henceforth &#145;he shunned women and put aside all hopes of a successful marriage and an heir. He relegated the Countess to a small and inconspicuous place in his life&#146;  (Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 194). He undertook the provincial duties entrusted to him (he was reappointed lord lieutenant of Staffordshire in 1629, and he was appointed a member of the council in the marches at the same time as his mother's death restored to him the family holdings in south Wales). He was conscientious and uncontentious in his discharge of these duties.<h2>
<a name="Intothefray16381642"></a>Into the fray, 1638&#150;1642</h2>By the late 1630s, then, Essex was a stranger to court, someone the king remembered with distaste, but he had not been a trouble-maker in recent years. And he had more military experience than anyone of his rank in the English peerage. So when Charles decided to use English force to impose his Scottish policies he appointed Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel (an earl marshal who had no experience of war), as lord-general and Essex as his second-in-command. But then the queen prevailed upon the king to give Essex's post to her favourite, Henry Rich, earl of Holland. Essex was demoted to lieutenant-general in command of the horse. Yet again he felt the smart more than the honour. It cannot have been easy, either, for him to have to put all his requests for supplies and money through Sir William Uvedale, treasurer at war and lover of his estranged wife. He carried out his duties scrupulously and effectively, and when the Scottish covenanting lords wrote to him, in an attempt to persuade him to stand down and use his influence to halt the planned invasion of their country, Essex forwarded the letters, unopened, to Charles. Unhappily the king chose to interpret the fact of the approach as evidence of his unsoundness and when honours were lavished on those who had led the king to a humiliating pacification, Essex was passed over. Three men he considered his inferiors received the Garter. The result was a deepening of the mutual ill will. In the second Scottish campaign of 1640 he was replaced as lieutenant-general by Thomas Wentworth, now earl of Strafford. By then Essex had attended every day of the Short Parliament and he had been prominent among the minority of twenty-five peers who had voted against voting supply before a consideration of grievances.<br>
<br>In summer 1640, for the first time in more than a decade, Essex remained in London, in the quarters he retained in the Strand, and he was almost certainly involved in secret discussions with the covenanters. He let John Pym have a tenement nearby and he was fully involved in the petition of the twelve peers who listed their and the people's grievances and called for a parliament and for a treaty with the Scots. Within a month Charles found himself unable to prevent a Scottish invasion and the occupation of Northumberland. He called a great council to York which Essex attended. He renewed his call for a parliament and a treaty, and he was one of several of the twelve to be appointed to the team of sixteen negotiators Charles sent to treat with the covenanters.<br>
<br>When the Long Parliament assembled on 3 November 1640 Essex was immediately prominent. As many as twelve members of the Commons owed their selection in significant part to him and could be counted on to amplify his views in the lower house; and he held two (at one time three) proxies as well as his own vote in the Lords. As in the previous six parliaments he was the most assiduous of all attenders. He played an important and restrained part in the prosecution of Strafford (though when Sir Edward Hyde appealed to him that Strafford deserved dismissal and imprisonment for life but not death, Essex replied &#145;stone-dead hath no fellow&#146;; Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.343), and he put his weight behind the dismantling of the instruments of personal rule and the reconstruction of royal government. He was thus a key figure in seeing the <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span> through the Lords, but he showed precocious alarm at the demands for a reconstruction of the church settlement, clearly fearing the political and social consequences of root and branch reform. Charles may have disliked him, but he recognized both that he carried huge moral and political authority and that he did not look much beyond a change of the personnel of government: as the earl of Clarendon later wrote, &#145;Essex was rather displeased with the person of the archbishop and some other bishops than indevoted to their function&#146;  (ibid., 1.328). He was one of the seven men whom Charles appointed to the privy council on 19 February 1641 (as were his closest friend and brother-in-law, now marquess of Hertford, and other long-term political allies). Essex worked hard to secure the addition of those whom he trusted, and most of those in the second round of appointments were close to him by blood or marriage, most remarkably his Irish Catholic half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3996/', "Ulick de Burgh (or Burke), fifth earl of Clanricarde")</script> (appointed under his English title of earl of St Albans). For a few months down to the summer recess (September&#150;November 1641) he bestrode the political world, notable as one of the &#145;popular lords&#146; but also as one whose advice the king sullenly followed. His key role was as chair of the committee charged with disbanding the English and Scottish armies. Still, it took Charles too long to offer him office and responsibility. He resisted appointing Essex lord lieutenant of Yorkshire (a key post during the Scottish occupation of the north-east). Too late&#151;at the end of July 1641&#151;Charles appointed him lord chamberlain and on 9 August appointed him commander of all the armed forces south of the Trent in case of an emergency while he was up in Scotland. But whereas Hertford was admitted more and more into the king's confidence Essex was kept at arm's length. In the end, his sense of public duty and slighted honour would count for more than the ties of blood.<br>
<br>Essex was resigned to childlessness, and the death of his brother, Walter, from plague in July resigned him to the extinction of his title and family name. Perhaps in the years to come this made him less anxious about how his actions might ruin his family. He had nothing left to offer but his life and his honour and he clearly valued the latter more than the former.<br>
<br>Essex was prominent&#151;as spokesman for the Lords&#151;in seeking in August 1641 to delay the king's departure for Scotland, and he also tried to prevent the queen from keeping the prince of Wales (he attempted in vain to place the prince under the protection of a group of protestant lords and chaplains at Richmond Palace). As general he had to deal with a number of scares of plots to assassinate MPs, by strengthening the forces under his personal control in Westminster and Whitehall. He was prominent among the sixteen commissioners who governed England during Charles's absence. On 6 November 1641, as news of the Irish uprising created panic in London, Oliver Cromwell moved an ordinance for Essex to mobilize all the forces of the southern half of England; and in an embryonic version of the militia ordinance Denzil Holles moved on 15 November that all the trained bands be &#145;put in a posture of defence and &hellip; the command [be given] to the earl of Essex&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes</span>, ed. W. H. Coates, 1942, 147). It is not therefore surprising that on the day after his return from Scotland to London the king revoked Essex's commission and stood down the guards which the earl had provided for the houses of parliament. For much of December the houses sought to assert a right to reorganize national defence under generals whom they nominated to the king. Essex's name was always prominent in these proposals. Distrust and distaste reinforced one another. Charles felt betrayed and therefore would not give Essex the honour and trust he craved. But Essex feeling keenly and resenting this lack of trust and recognition constantly rubbed salt into Charles's wounds. They were two thin-skinned men jabbing fingers into one another's flesh.<br>
<br>When on the morning of 5 January 1642 Essex was told by the countess of Carlisle, from gossip at the queen's table, that Charles intended to seize five members of the Commons whom he intended to put on trial for treason, he tipped off the MPs concerned. Charles, humiliated, withdrew from London and made his way, gradually, to York. Essex refused all commands to join him there, pleading the order of the parliament that he attend to the business of the realm there. In doing so he broke decisively from his brother-in-law and confidant Hertford, who, after a bout of diplomatic illness, made his way to the itinerant king. On 9 April Essex was dismissed from the post of lord chamberlain that he had possessed but barely held. He was the first peer to surrender his royal warrants as lord lieutenant and to accept new ones under the militia ordinance. He was drifting into treason.<br>
<br>Essex spent the spring and early summer months in the parliamentary administrative arrangements for the expeditionary force raised to put down the Irish uprising. But as the king escalated the political rhetoric and the preparations for war, the houses responded and all their military plans centred on Essex. On 12 July the Commons<blockquote>resolved that an army shall be forthwith raised for the safety of the king's person, the defence of both houses of parliament, and of those who have obeyed their orders and commands; and for the preservation of the true religion, the laws, liberties and peace of the kingdom. [And] resolved, that the Earl of Essex be named general thereof. (Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 307)</blockquote>He never wavered about accepting this office with its risks and responsibilities. He took it on fearlessly and resolutely. He drew up his will, dispersing his estates among his sisters and their children with generous provision for his servants and for the poor, and, providing himself with a coffin and a winding sheet, he set out to make war in the name of king and parliament against a king ensnared, body and mind, by evil counsellors. Any doubt that he had done the right thing was removed by the discovery that the odious Sir William Uvedale was one of the five commissioners appointed to bring peace proposals from the king to the houses.<h2>
<a name="Captaingeneralthefirstcampaign1642"></a>Captain-general: the first campaign, 1642</h2>Essex was captain-general of the English parliament's forces for thirty months. In that time he did not win a single battle outright, but he did not lose a pitched battle outright either. He was meticulous in planning his campaigns, technically correct and effective in carrying out military manoeuvres&#151;forced marches, sieges, battlefield dispositions&#151;but such caution made him slow, and technical effectiveness also made him predictable. He never took his enemies by surprise. His experience of the Thirty Years' War made him pessimistic about the possibility of knock-out blows, gloomy about the prospects of keeping poorly paid and supplied bodies of men together for a sustained campaign, determined to see the war in defensive terms, and constantly seeking to promote the deadlock out of which he and others could squeeze a negotiated settlement. And he craved absolute power as general over all other commanders and over the peace process. Thus he sought appointment as constable of England, with plenipotentiary powers of war and peace (a post with fourteenth-century precedents). And when he was denied the freedom of action he craved he chafed as much as ever, and was as thin-skinned towards the parliament as he had hitherto been towards the king.<br>
<br>Essex began his campaign by gathering a remarkable life guard of one hundred men, including many future major-generals and republicans (Charles Fleetwood, Henry Ireton, Thomas Harrison, and Edmund Ludlow) as well as the sons of the lords Bedford, Holland, and Saye and Sele, serving under the motto &#145;God with us&#146;. He built up a strong commissariat and selected his general officers from those with noble blood and those with strong continental experience. By 9 September he was ready for war, and he took his leave of the houses. As he rode in his coach from the Strand towards Watling Street thousands flocked out to cheer him on: &#145;no rebel had received such a royal farewell before&#146;  (Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 325). He went to war a hero in September 1642, and from then on it was downhill all the way.<br>
<br>Essex's troops were mustered at Northampton, and there he raised his standard on 14 September. The king was trying to bring his army up to strength in the upper Severn valley, and Essex set as his first task to take Worcester and cut off the royalist supply lines. His troops lost a skirmish at Powick Bridge (23 September) but succeeded in occupying the town and thus secured control of the river. Essex then wasted three weeks securing control of the hinterland of Worcester, delivering the initiative to the king. As the latter moved south-east in a straight line from Shrewsbury to London, Essex had to force march his troops so as to intercept them. The result was the great drawn battle of Edgehill, near Banbury, on 23 October. Each side thought it was lower on ammunition and morale than the other, and so declined to resume the battle and set off on parallel quick marches towards London. Essex won the race and, reinforced by the London militia, interposed himself between the king and the City at Turnham Green.<br>
<br>Despite having twice as many men as the king (24,000 : 12,000) Essex's council of war decided to await the king's attack. After a tense stand-off the king retreated to Oxford. The chance for a quick end to the war was lost.<h2>
<a name="Lordgeneral1643"></a>Lord-general, 1643</h2>Essex spent the bitter winter of 1642&#150;3 quartered in and around Windsor. As a result his army melted away with the winter snows. And so more time was spent recruiting back up to strength. He spent most of 1643 seeking to secure complete control of the Thames valley. His strategic purposes were to capture the king or at least to knock out his headquarters at Oxford. With the exception of a march to relieve Gloucester&#151;which he unwillingly undertook after repeated orders from the houses&#151;his army was never more than 30 miles from Oxford from the time that he captured Reading on 26 April. In unspectacular fashion he did take control of the surrounding towns, and he did tighten the noose around Oxford, but it seemed little return for all the investment of men and money that parliament put at his disposal. A sharp letter from Pym led to his tendering his resignation on 28 June, but it was not accepted. He was, however, speaking openly of making peace, and that is probably why the houses appointed Sir William Waller (who had had a number of spectacular successes blunted by heavy defeat at Roundway Down) to a semi-autonomous command. Essex reacted with fury to this slight, and called the bluff of Pym and his allies: they backed off their support for his rival. Essex's relief of the siege of Gloucester (8 September) and skilful deployment of troops in a running battle through the suburbs of Newark (20 September) restored his name somewhat. Indeed many historians see this battle as the turning point of the war: as the king's last realistic prospect of victory. Slow, cautious, and unimaginative Essex may have been. But with far deeper pockets and more solid control of a less scattered heartland, parliament was always going to win a long war.<h2>
<a name="ThepoliticsofattritionOctober1643toMay1644"></a>The politics of attrition, October 1643 to May 1644</h2>Essex spent most of the next seven months at Westminster losing a war of attrition to shore up his personal authority and to maintain an army worthy of the name under his command. The simplest struggle was for resources. His army was a national army but as a result it had no regional base, no bloc of counties from which to raise the men and supplies to keep itself going. In the winter months, with no pay coming in and in quarters that were cold, damp, and miserable, most of his army&#151;all but 2000 of his foot and more than half his cavalry&#151;drifted away, taking their weapons. Such ammunition as was available was procured by Waller, the earl of Manchester, and other commanders who were actively engaged in the field. At one point, meditating on his inability to protect London if there was a lightning strike, Essex even commissioned one Thomas Taylor to raise a company of archers to help defend the capital. New men were recruited, but were then put into the dispiriting winter quarters. They then just melted away. Essex made a whole series of visits to raise morale to promise more cash and supplies. But it was not until May 1644 that he had put together a fighting force large enough to undertake a campaign.<br>
<br>Inactivity bred demoralization and prevented all thought of a winter campaign. And in any case Essex was preoccupied with the politics of war. He spent much of October 1643 trying to get the houses to remove Sir William Waller from his command for having refused point blank an order to bring his southern association army to join him on his return from Gloucester. Waller simply refused to accept that he was Essex's subordinate. Essex even threatened to resign. According to a clerk's account of Essex's ultimatum at a conference of the houses: &#145;the Lord General desired of this House, and the House of Commons, leave to deliver up his commission, and go beyond the seas, in regard of the commission to Sr Wm Waller, which is inconsistent with his, and in regard of the many discouragements he hath received in being General&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 1643&#150;4, 246). In the end there was the inevitable uneasy compromise. Waller resigned, but was immediately recommissioned by Essex as commander of the London trained bands, and spent a hectic winter besieging Basing House and Arundel and mopping up pockets of royalist resistance in the south coast counties from Kent to Hampshire. Much of December 1643 was taken up with the court martial of Nathaniel Fiennes for surrendering Bristol long before its defence was impossible (he was convicted and sentenced to death and then reprieved by Essex). Essex's time was wasted with processing the demand from Lord Willoughby of Parham that his commission to command troops in Lincolnshire be upheld in the face of the ordinance placing Lincolnshire in the eastern association and its troops under the command of the earl of Manchester. In January and February Essex fought a losing battle to prevent the creation of the committee of both kingdoms, which would give Westminster politicians (including many of his critics) control of military strategy and the authority to direct scarce resources to the detriment of his honour, authority, and commission (very much in that order). And (at a time when the king was pretending that the meeting of some eighty peers and a hundred members at the Commons at Oxford was the real parliament and the assembly at Westminster a rebellious remnant) Essex was the recipient of a series of peace initiatives from Oxford, which he dutifully handed on unopened to the speakers of the houses. Each letter led to many hours of committees. By late spring Essex was caught up in a thirteen-day stand-off between Lords and Commons over the renewal of the eastern association ordinance and a briefer, blunter, nastier exchange between the houses over the extension of the life of the committee of both kingdoms. He lost both arguments. By now most of the regional commanders&#151;the Fairfaxes in Yorkshire, Sir William Brereton in the north midlands, Sir Thomas Myddleton in north Wales, Manchester in the eastern counties, above all the Scots&#151;never thought to ask his advice or tell him their plans. They reported and negotiated directly with the committee of both kingdoms. Waller was directly answerable to him, but that did not stop him appealing over Essex's head or behind his back when he did not feel like co-operating. For a man of Essex's pride and self-importance this was intolerable. But the blunt fact is that he was doing nothing to earn the respect and goodwill of the other generals.<h2>
<a name="DisasterinthewestMaytoSeptember1644"></a>Disaster in the west, May to September 1644</h2>Not until mid-May did Essex launch his new campaign. Having interrupted a meeting of the Westminster assembly and persuaded it to suspend church reform for a day and to devote itself to prayers for his success, he found it necessary neither to change his will nor to repack his coffin. A campaign that was to end in catastrophe began in hope. He decided to strike at the very heart of the king's territory by an assault on Oxford. Within three weeks he had retaken Reading and Abingdon and had almost encircled the king's headquarters, but, as Essex secured the last of the Cherwell bridges in a fierce fight involving 4000 men, the king, with almost 6000 men, punched his way out of Oxford to the north. Although Essex gave chase the king was in no hurry to fight, and kept slipping away from him. Meanwhile reports reached Essex that Lyme Regis was likely to fall, opening up Dorset and the southern counties to the western royalists. At a crucial and contested council of war on 6 June it was decided that Waller with his light cavalry should harry the king (this led three weeks later to Waller's crushing defeat at Cropredy Bridge), while Essex went to the relief of Lyme and the liberation of the south-west.<br>
<br>It was not in itself a foolish strategy. This was a brilliantly managed operation, with the army marching along a southerly route, its movements co-ordinated with those of the main part of the navy: as Bulstrode Whitelocke put it, &#145;the Earl of Warwick with his fleet sailed along the coast as the Lord General marched, and carried his ammunition, and sent ships to keep off the enemy&#146;  (Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 88). For eight weeks all was well managed, and Essex relentlessly recaptured garrison towns and fortified manor houses throughout Somerset and Devon, culminating in the relief of Plymouth. This was important of itself, and it also meant that Essex had now trapped the queen in Cornwall. The crushing defeat of the royalist armies at Marston Moor on 2 July paradoxically released the king from thoughts of combining with his northern armies. Now Charles <i>had</i> to prioritize the west. His defeat of Waller freed him to chase Essex and to join up with Hopton's army, which was in Bristol. And the plight of the queen ensured that Charles would focus all his energies on rescuing her. So Essex finished up trapped between the queen and Sir Richard Grenville in Cornwall and the king and Hopton hot on his heels. The tension was showing: he condoned the execution of Irish prisoners at Dorchester, in clear breach of his own articles of war. He had assumed both that Waller would regroup and come to join him and that, as a last resort, he could embark his army on Warwick's ships and sail to safety. But he chased Grenville too far and for too long and he found himself surrounded by vastly superior numbers of royalists at Lostwithiel. On 31 August his cavalry broke through the royalist lines, and the infantry marched through a summer storm to Fowey. But strong winds prevented Warwick from coming inshore to transport them away, and they were faced by surrender or a massacre. Essex sailed away in a fishing boat, leaving Philip Skippon to negotiate surrender articles.<br>
<br>&#145;It is the greatest blow that ever befell our party,&#146; Essex wrote to Sir Philip Stapilton on 3 September, &#145;I desire nothing more than to come to the Tryal, such losses as these must not be smothered up&#146;  (J. Rushworth, <span class="italic">Historical Collections</span>, 8 vols., 1721&#150;2, 5.703&#150;4). Although Independent divines were quick to denounce him from London pulpits the houses closed ranks for once as they sought to mitigate the disaster. They ordered the earl of Manchester to join Waller and such troops as Essex could assemble and reassemble and to interpose themselves between the king and London. Essex had lost the moral right to command this joint force, and the houses were not yet ready to fight over the succession, and so on 14 October day-to-day management of the joint army was entrusted to a council of war consisting of the three generals, together with Lord Robartes, Lieutenant-General Oliver Cromwell, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, and two members of the Commons attending the army. This camel of a committee secured a victory at Newbury on 23 October but botched the aftermath. Since Essex and Waller were unable to be in the same room together it was perhaps as well that for more than a fortnight from 15 October Essex was <i>hors de combat</i> with &#145;excessive flux and vomiting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.189) and under medical supervision in Reading.<h2>
<a name="Eclipse16451646"></a>Eclipse, 1645&#150;1646</h2>In the ensuing months the recriminations between Manchester and Cromwell dominated the political scene, but behind that were two deeper struggles. The first was between those who were willing to seek a negotiated settlement to the civil war, and those determined to impose a settlement in the wake of a complete victory. Essex was for the best peace that could be secured, not least because the willingness of men like Cromwell to promote low-born men within the army made him fear for social order. The second struggle was over how far the English parliamentarians had to honour to the letter the terms of the solemn league and covenant which had tied the English to the vision of the Scots for the erection of a new confessional state drawing heavily on the Scottish model.<br>
<br>Essex was no rigid presbyterian, and indeed his own preferred system of church governance was probably a lame, Erastian episcopalianism, but he disliked sects and sectarianism, and if presbyterianism would safeguard the virtues of the old Calvinist international he would accept it. All these issues made him detest and suspect Oliver Cromwell, and on 3 December 1644 he called a meeting of all his allies and of the Scottish commissioners in Essex House. The Scots were proposing to denounce Cromwell to the parliament as an &#145;incendiary&#146; and Essex wanted to know if his friends thought an impeachment on such a charge could succeed. The weathervane lawyers, Bulstrode Whitelocke and John Maynard, thought not, and Essex let the matter drop. But in the months that followed, as Essex and his friends fought the self-denying ordinance all the way, it is clear that they cared almost as much about ensuring that Cromwell was subject to its provisions as that they should be exempt. After four months of procedural foot-dragging they were completely defeated. So desperate was Essex to prevent Fairfax from getting the very powers he had so jealously guarded&#151;the power to choose the officers of his army&#151;that on 17 March 1645 he even tried (in vain) to use the proxy of his Irish Catholic half-brother, the earl of Clanricarde, to block Fairfax's nominations. Having clung to his commissions long after he had lost all the parliamentary battles Essex finally resigned them in a dignified statement (&#145;a well phrased and restrained statement [in which] he accepted his eclipse and stepped aside like a gentleman&#146;, as his twentieth-century biographer put it; Snow, <span class="italic">Essex the Rebel</span>, 479).<br>
<br>The remaining eighteen months of Essex's life were spent in the half-light. Once he had left the army, his record was looked at by many through rose-tinted spectacles. Josiah Ricraft put together, as a best-selling broadside, <span class="italic">A perfect list of the many victories obtained (through the blessing of God) by the parliaments forces under the command of his excellency, Robert earl of Essex</span>; and, after his death, early in 1647 Ricraft would be even more specific in highlighting his victories in <span class="italic">A Survey of England's Champions</span>. There was little opposition in parliament to the showering of financial rewards on Essex&#151;most notably an annuity of &pound;10,000 a year out of confiscated royalist land voted to him, without a division in either house. He became a venerable figure in semi-retirement, regularly attending the Lords, but saying little. He remained a figurehead for those who supported the broad peace strategy known as the Newcastle propositions, and he did all he could quietly to impede the military career of Oliver Cromwell. But then at the end of his life he seems to have planned a major comeback. He had asked, in 1642, to be appointed to the old medieval post of constable, guardian of the realm at a time of crisis. In summer 1646, after Charles had surrendered himself to the Scots, Essex began to reassert the claim, affecting the symbols of vice-regal, protectoral rank, attended as he came and went to the Lords by heralds in their tabards. Whether this would have provoked some kind of crisis can never be known&#151;for at precisely this juncture he died quite suddenly. He suffered a stroke on 10 September 1646 after a strenuous day's stag-hunting in Windsor Forest and died four days later at Essex House.<h2>
<a name="Funeralandreputation"></a>Funeral and reputation</h2>Essex was accorded the greatest state funeral of any non-royal personage for many decades. More than 3000 people were marshalled by the officers of the College of Arms for a funeral based on that of Henry, prince of Wales, to whom Essex had been companion in his teenage years: &#145;almost all the details of the composition of the cortege seem to have been copied copiously from accounts of Henry's funeral&#146;  (Adamson, &#145;Chivalry and political culture&#146;, 191).<br>
<br>So Essex was buried, on 22 October 1646, with the pomp so long denied him in life, and was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey. Richard Vines, an old friend and minister of the parish within which Essex House lay, preached a funeral oration on a text from the second book of <span class="roman">Samuel</span>, about how Abner had delivered the Israelites from the tyranny of Saul (explicitly, Charles I) and subjected them to the sceptre of David (explicitly, parliament). A month later the new tomb was vandalized and Essex's effigy beheaded by an axe-wielding former royalist soldier. And at the Restoration his refurbished effigy was destroyed on the orders of Charles II. But his corpse was left undisturbed on both occasions, and is still in the abbey, marked by a modest plaque installed by Dean Stanley in mid-Victorian times.<br>
<br>Essex died without male heirs. The title was extinguished and his property was divided among his sisters and cousins, each fighting like a tiger to get more than their fair share. His life was dominated by the circumstances of his birth: by a desperate concern for the good name put at risk by his father's treason. He was the child of an adulterer (though also of a cuckold), and he twice became an infamous cuckold himself. He was a man of conventional godly piety. He was totally out of sympathy with both the new piety of the court of Charles I and the &#145;teeming liberty&#146; of zealous men who attached themselves to the movement which he led as a movement of ancient aristocratic virtue. He was a soldier who cared more for honour than for victory, a general who expected to create the conditions for negotiation, not to win outright. He was a devoted but mute parliamentarian, a man who yearned for a king who would take his counsel, but who did nothing to earn the trust that would make that possible. He lacked his father's flamboyance and arrogance, but not his capacity for self-immolation. He was an inverted Midas: all that was golden in his inheritance and circumstance he turned to dust. Only in the false bombast of his funeral was the recognition he craved ever accorded him. His was a life of unfulfilled promise.<br>
