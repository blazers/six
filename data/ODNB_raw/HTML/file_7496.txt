<span class="headword">Denman,  Thomas  Aitchison</span>, second Baron Denman  (1805&#150;1894), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born in London on 30 July 1805, was the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7495/', "Thomas Denman, first Baron Denman (1779&#150;1854)")</script>, and his wife, Theodosia Anne (1779&#150;1852), the eldest daughter of Richard Vevers, rector of Kettering. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7493/', "George Denman")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford. He matriculated on 17 May 1823. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1833, and for eighteen years acted as associate to his father as chief justice of England.<br>
<br>Denman succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father on 22 September 1854. He was always concerned rather with politics than law. During his long life as a peer he was a regular frequenter of the House of Lords, but won notoriety rather from his eccentricities than any eminent qualifications. Though described by Dod as a Liberal until 1884, he frequently voted against major Liberal bills. Limitation of the duration of speeches in the House of Lords and the granting of female suffrage were subjects to which he unsuccessfully devoted his support. Year after year with unfailing regularity, from 1886 to 1894, he brought in bills to secure these objects, and, despite his inability on any occasion to secure even a second reading, he was not deterred from making fresh efforts in each succeeding year.<br>
<br>Denman married, on 12 August 1829, Georgina, eldest daughter of Thomas Roe; she died on 25 April 1871. He then married, on 10 October 1871, Maria, the eldest daughter of James Aitchison of Alderston, co. Haddington, and by royal licence on 20 December 1879 assumed the additional surname of Aitchison under the will of his wife's mother. With neither of his wives had he any children. He died of heart failure at the King's Arms, Berwick upon Tweed, on 9 August 1894 and was buried at Alderston.<br>
