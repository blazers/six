<span class="headword">Loutit,  John Freeman</span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">radiobiologist and haematologist</span>, was born on 19 February 1910 at 16 Almondbury Road, Mount Lawley, Perth, Western Australia, the only child of John Freeman Loutit (1868&#150;1950), a mechanical and locomotive engineer, and his wife, Margaret Gould, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broadfoot (1878&#150;1971), whose family were also engineers. His antecedents had emigrated from the Orkneys to Australia in the 1850s. He was educated at the local Church of England grammar school and the universities of Western Australia and Melbourne (Trinity College). In Hilary term 1931 he took up a Rhodes scholarship at St John's College, Oxford, where he read physiology and graduated with a second-class degree in natural sciences in 1933. He later completed his medical training at the London Hospital medical college, winning prizes there. On 14 June 1941 he married Thelma Salusbury (1913&#150;1992); they had a son and two daughters. Also in 1941 Loutit was appointed to take charge of the south-west London blood supply depot, where his research career began. He made contributions to knowledge of the preservation of blood for transfusion, and also of types of haemolytic anaemia. At the end of the Second World War he took part in work on the treatment of starvation in Holland and was made an officer of the order of Orange Nassau.<br>
<br>After the end of the Second World War the government felt the need for a research unit to investigate the biological hazards of radiation, in view of the use of atomic weapons and also of nuclear power. Loutit was invited to be the director of the Medical Research Council (MRC) radiobiology unit located initially at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, but independent of it. He set out to collect a nucleus of talented physicists and biologists to investigate various fundamental aspects of the hazards of ionizing radiation. The unit's programme encompassed the effects of radiation on cellular function, induction of chromosome aberrations, the pathogenesis of injury in various organs, the absorption and retention of radioisotopes by the body, and the genetic effects of radiation.<br>
<br>Loutit was a hands-on scientist (personally ingesting small quantities of radioactive material in order to assess their biological effects) and made many contributions to knowledge of the uptake and retention of radioactive isotopes from the air and the food chain, particularly isotopes of strontium and iodine. However, his most important contribution was the demonstration of the immunosuppressive effect of radiation. Using a strain of mouse with a chromosome translocation resulting in a recognizable cell marker, Loutit and his colleagues showed that mice treated with high doses of X-rays would accept bone marrow grafts from genetically incompatible donors, and could thus be rescued from the lethal effects of irradiation. This discovery led to major advances in knowledge of the effects of radiation, and also to advances in the treatment of leukaemia and other malignancies, and was relevant to organ transplantation. For it, Loutit, jointly with his colleagues David Barnes, Charles Ford, and John Hamerton, was awarded the Robert Roesler de Villiers award of the Leukemia Society of the USA. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1963 and was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of St Andrews and Stockholm. He served on many national and international committees concerned with radiation, often as chairman. He was appointed CBE in 1957 for his services to radiation protection.<br>
<br>Throughout the roughly twenty years that Loutit was director the MRC radiobiology unit grew and came to be of major international status, being particularly strong in genetics and cell biology, Loutit having appreciated early on the importance of the genetic effects of radiation. However, in 1969 the MRC recommended that the unit should be reduced to half its size. Loutit was unhappy with this decision and resigned. He returned to work full time at the bench for another nineteen years. During this time he worked on haematopoietic stem cells and their function. He argued that there was a variety of stem cells in the bone marrow giving rise to all the different types of blood cells, and also bone forming cells, osteoblasts, and bone destroying cells, osteoclasts. He also studied the induction of myeloid leukaemia and of bone tumours by bone seeking radioactive isotopes. In his last field of work he continued his lifetime interest in using gene mutations to answer biological problems, and studied various mouse mutants of haematological importance. During his career he published two books and more than 200 scientific papers.<br>
<br>Loutit was a kind-hearted, reserved, somewhat taciturn man, who never spoke ill of others, and was always modest. He was devoted to his family, with whom he lived in the village of Steventon, Oxfordshire, from the 1940s until the end of his life. He was a convinced Christian and attended Steventon church regularly. He brought to his hobbies the same enthusiasm and attention to detail that he brought to his work, and was a keen gardener and cricketer. His skill in cooking was legendary, and he regularly cooked for dinner parties at his home. He died of pneumonia and dementia at the Grange Nursing Home, Stanford in the Vale, Oxfordshire, on 11 June 1992. He was buried on 21 June 1992 in the graveyard of St Michael's Church, Steventon, Oxfordshire. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
