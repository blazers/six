<span class="headword">Hislop,  Robert Steven <span class="st"> [Steve]</span></span>  (1962&#150;2003), <span class="occ">racing motorcyclist</span>, was born at Haig Maternity Hospital in Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 11 January 1962, the first of two sons of Alexander (Sandy) Hislop (1936?&#150;1979), joiner, and his wife, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1946?), knitwear mill worker. The family lived in a rented farm cottage in the village of Chesters, south-east of Hawick. He came from a motorcycle racing family and neighbourhood. His father, Sandy, had been a club racer between 1956 and 1961, while he and his younger brother, Garry, grew up idolizing the Hawick rider and local hero Jimmy Guthrie.<br>
<br>Hislop attended Hobkirk primary school and then Jedburgh grammar school and enjoyed neither. He first raced in 1979 and started work as an apprentice motorcycle mechanic at T. B. Oliver's garage in Denholm, whose owner Jim Oliver was an early supporter and sponsor. He spent four years there before fully qualifying, and then another four years before quitting to race full-time in the 1988 season. His commitment to racing was, however, in the face of repeated personal adversity. In 1979 his father died in his arms of heart failure, and in 1982 his younger brother, Garry, who had established himself as a rider of enormous promise, died in a club meeting at Silloth in Cumbria. Hislop spent the next few years drinking heavily and crashing a succession of cars.<br>
<br>In 1983 Hislop started racing again in earnest, entering the 350 cc Newcomers' race at the Manx grand prix, which his late brother had won the previous year. He finished second. This was the start of a long and famous association with the Isle of Man. Thereafter he reined in his socializing and worked around the clock. In 1985 he entered the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy (TT) for the first time on machines loaned by Jim Oliver, finishing twenty-first in the formula 1, tenth in the production 750, and eighteenth in the senior. Only two years later, in 1987, he took his first win, in the formula 2 race, in fortuitous circumstances. He had been leading that year's Junior TT by a huge margin when a failed ignition unit ended his race. After drowning his sorrows in a Manx pub Hislop joined the queue at a burger van where he was overheard bemoaning his inability to afford a replacement unit by a sponsor who agreed to buy him one. It was fitted the following day for the formula 2 race, which he won by 17 seconds.<br>
<br>Between 1987 and 1994 Hislop went on to eleven wins on the island, a number then surpassed only by Joey Dunlop and Mike Hailwood. In 1989 he also became the first rider to lap the island at over 120 m.p.h. In all he won one formula 2 and three formula 1 races, one production, two 600, and four of the blue-riband senior races. The most famous of these was his win in the 1992 Senior TT, a race which passed into motor-racing legend. Having swept all before them on the dominant factory Honda RC30s the previous year, Hislop and his rival Carl Fogarty were on less fancied equipment, Fogarty with Yamaha and Hislop on a mechanically brittle and largely untested rotary-engined Norton 588 developed at a fraction of the cost of the factory machines, and on which he had had virtually no practice. In the senior race, which is the climax to TT week, held over six laps of the 37.74 mile circuit, Hislop and Fogarty were never more than 7.4 seconds apart, changed places eight times, and repeatedly broke lap records which they had set the previous year, Fogarty's desperate final lap at an average speed of over 123 m.p.h. standing unbroken for seven years. Hislop hung on to a riotously popular win over the 226 mile race distance by just 4.4 seconds, the first rider to win the Senior TT on a British bike since Hailwood three decades previously in 1961. The race was regarded as the greatest in TT history. Both Hislop and Fogarty subsequently announced that they would not race again on the island since the power and pace of the machines had made it too dangerous, though Hislop did reluctantly and for contractual reasons return for the formula 1 and senior races with Honda in 1994, winning both.<br>
<br>Hislop's distinction was that while most British and Irish riders of the modern era tended to specialize in either road or circuit racing, he was one of the handful to excel in both. On circuits he won the British 250 cc championship in 1990, and twice the British Superbike (BSB) Championship, the acme of British motorcycle racing. He claimed the title (on a Ducati) at his first attempt in 1995, though always resenting the suggestion that this was effectively due to the withdrawal that year of his rival contender James Whitham with cancer. After breaking his neck in a horrific crash during a World Superbike (WSB) round at Brands Hatch in 2000, he was closing in on another title in 2001 when he crashed into his title rival John Reynolds at Rockingham, and finished second in the championship. That season he showed his potential in world superbike racing, finishing an impressive third as a wild-card entry in the WSB round at Donington Park, where the following season, on a standard national-class bike, he also broke the track record set by the multiple world champion Valentino Rossi on a far more powerful factory grand prix machine. Having recovered from his injuries in 2002 Hislop reclaimed the BSB title for Ducati.<br>
<br>In the summer of 2003 Hislop was reigning BSB champion and, after twenty years in motorcycle racing, likely to retire at the end of that season. He had taken up helicopter flying in 2001, in anticipation of a substitute for the excitement of racing. As he was flying alone from a friend's house in Horsleyhill, near Hawick, to Wycombe Air Park, Buckinghamshire, on 30 July 2003, his borrowed Robinson R44 helicopter crashed in low cloud near a remote Borders hillside at Caerlanrig Farm, near Teviothead, Roxburghshire. A report by the Air Accidents Investigations Branch released in May 2005 concluded that pilot error or a technical problem were to blame, confirmed by a Scottish fatal accident inquiry in May 2008. He was survived by two sons, Aaron and Connor, from a previous relationship with Kelly Bailey, with whom he shared custody and remained on good terms, and by his then partner, Ally Greenwood, a banker. His funeral service was held on 7 August 2003 at Teviot parish church, Hawick, attended by crowds of mourners to whom the service was relayed by loudspeakers, while around a thousand motorcyclists joined the cort&egrave;ge to Southdean cemetery, near his boyhood village of Chesters, where he was buried alongside his father and brother. His headstone bore an engraving of him riding the Ducati which took him to his final BSB title.<br>
<br>Hislop, journalistically tagged &#145;the Flying Haggis&#146; but known overwhelmingly simply as Hizzy, was widely regarded as one of the most naturally talented and smoothest riders of his generation. But as his rival James Whitham observed, Hislop &#145;never needed much encouragement to feel the world was against him&#146;  (Whitham, 179), and his temperamental nature, and disinclination to take unnecessary risks on machines with which he was unhappy, established his reputation for being, in the words of the former TT and grand prix rider and later team boss Rob McElnea, a &#145;flawed genius&#146;, unbeatable on his day but on others exasperatingly off the pace. Hislop further inhibited his prospects by retaining a direct and outspoken personal style, and disdaining the commercial and corporate expectations of international racing.<br>
<br>If anything this enhanced Hislop's domestic status and popularity, which are reflected in the number and the distribution of memorials to him. A life-sized statue of the rider in bronze, by the Fife sculptor David Annan, was erected in Wilton Park, Hawick, standing directly opposite that of his boyhood hero Jimmy Guthrie; another was placed at Onchan Head on the Isle of Man, where Hislop had settled in 1991. A permanent Steve Hislop exhibition was created in the Drumlanrig Tower Museum, Hawick, as well as a simple memorial cairn at Caerlenrig where his helicopter came down, while a corner at Knockhill circuit in Scotland, and a chicane at Oulton Park, are named after him.<br>
