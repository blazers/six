</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cross,  Richard Assheton</span>, first Viscount Cross  (1823&#150;1914), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Red Scar, near Preston, Lancashire, on 30 May 1823, the fifth of six children of William Cross (1771&#150;1827), of Red Scar, and his wife, Ellen, eldest daughter of Edward Chaffers, of Liverpool and Everton, a collateral relative of Richard Chaffers, the well-known potter and rival of Josiah Wedgwood, and of William Chaffers, the authority on hallmarks and potters' marks. Cross was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he rowed in the first Trinity eight at the head of the river, and in 1845 was president of the Cambridge Union. Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1849, he went on the northern circuit. As his father and grandfather had held legal office in the county palatine court of common pleas at Preston, he started with the advantage of a well-known name, and quickly built up a substantial practice. In 1852 he married Georgiana (<i>d</i>. 1907), third daughter of Thomas Lyon of Appleton Hall, near Warrington. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Cross became leader of the Preston and Salford quarter session bar; wrote a book on pauper settlement (1853); and collaborated in a work on the jurisdiction of quarter sessions in non-criminal matters (1858), which remained the standard manual for practitioners until that jurisdiction was almost completely abolished on the creation of county councils. In 1857 his position was sufficiently assured to allow him to stand for parliament. He won Preston as a Conservative and held the seat until 1862. The only pledge on which his supporters insisted was that he would not join the Carlton Club; and he signalized his independence by being the only Conservative member to vote in favour of Gladstone's repeal of the paper duties, as well as by voting against the same proposal when Gladstone unconstitutionally, as he held, tacked it to a money bill in order to circumvent opposition in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>In 1860 the death of his father-in-law led to Cross's becoming a partner in Parr's Bank at Warrington, a step which involved giving up both his practice at the bar and his seat in parliament. But the years 1862&#150;8 were of great importance in his career; for to the legal ability which he had already shown he was now to add financial experience as partner in a great bank in times of exceptional difficulty (the &#145;cotton famine&#146;), and an intimate knowledge of the problems of local government. In 1865, when Parr's Bank was one of the pioneers of limited liability as applied to banking, Cross became deputy chairman, and he succeeded to the chairmanship in 1870. During these years he also became chairman or deputy chairman of every local-government body then existing in his neighbourhood, including two courts of quarter sessions, a highway board, a board of guardians, and the governing bodies of many charitable institutions. The eminent services which he afterwards rendered to the state were based on the intimate knowledge thus gained of local conditions in an industrial area.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1868 Cross again stood for parliament, this time for the new constituency of South-West Lancashire, where he achieved a sensational success by defeating Gladstone, then at the height of popularity and power, and heading the poll. Family connections and the influence of his old school and college friend, the fifteenth earl of Derby, had their share in this, but Cross's personal popularity was the decisive factor. Returning to parliament a marked man, he was active with W. H. Smith and Viscount Sandon in harrying Gladstone's government, and, with fellow Lancashire members, in pressing in 1871&#150;2 for a more positive Conservative policy based on social, administrative, and economic reform and on colonial questions. Yet he lacked sparkle in debate, and Disraeli performed, as he said, an &#145;act of almost unexampled confidence&#146; in 1874 in making Cross home secretary without his having undergone a probation in some minor post.<br>
<br>From the very start, however, Cross was an unqualified success as home secretary. Disraeli had shown in his early novels, and in his Manchester speech of 1872, an appreciation of the need for social reform; but he had little idea what direction it should take, and the only promise on the subject made in his election address of 1874 was that he would give the country a rest from &#145;incessant and harassing legislation&#146;; moreover, he not only allowed but expected his colleagues to have policies of their own. It is certain, therefore, that Cross was not merely responsible for the details, but had a large part in shaping the principles of the social reforms which are perhaps the greatest achievement of the ministry of 1874&#150;80.<br>
<br>Cross's first measure, the <span class="roman">Licensing Bill</span> of 1874, seemed too obviously framed to conciliate the drink interest and had to be substantially modified: &#145;not much to be proud of&#146; was his own admission in after years. A measure more congenial to him was the <span class="roman">Artisans' Dwellings Act</span> of 1875, which empowered municipal authorities, by compulsory purchase if necessary, to clear slums and to let or sell the land for the provision of new working-class housing. It forbade the enhancement of compensation on the ground of compulsion; and it substituted the award of a departmental arbitrator for the proprietary and local sympathies of juries. At the same time a Home Office order was issued requiring all local authorities to appoint medical officers of health and sanitary inspectors. Cross was anxious, however, to forestall the charge of collectivism, insisting that &#145;it is not the duty of the Government to provide any class of citizens with any of the necessaries of life&#146;. The costs of implementing the act restricted its impact, though Joseph Chamberlain afterwards said that the reforms which made a model city of Birmingham would have been impossible without it. Cross was subsequently regarded as an authority on housing problems, and published articles on the subject in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> in 1882 and 1884.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> of 1874 dealt with the employment of women and children in textile factories; and the <span class="roman">Factories and Workshops Act</span>, 1878, consolidated and codified the mass of legislation on this subject. The latter embodied the recommendations of a royal commission appointed in 1876. The <span class="roman">Employers and Workmen Act</span>, 1875, and its associated <span class="roman">Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act</span>, on the other hand, owed little to the royal commission which preceded them. It was Disraeli who said that the policy of these acts was initiated by Cross and would have been vetoed by the rest of the cabinet but for his own support. Largely relieving workers of the threat of imprisonment for breach of contract, and trade unions of the possibility of prosecution for conspiracy and restrictions on peaceful picketing, the measures were warmly welcomed by the labour movement. Cross also legislated to preserve open spaces near large towns, and transferred the management of prisons and the cost of their upkeep from local to central government. His last proposal, to acquire and transfer to a single authority all the undertakings which supplied London with water, was sharply criticized on the ground of excessive compensation and had to be dropped; but the idea was sound.<br>
<br>In opposition (1880&#150;85) the school of businessmen in politics to which Cross belonged was speedily thrown into the shade by Lord Randolph Churchill, whose dislike for them was open and violent. Accordingly, although Cross returned to the Home Office in the short-lived ministry of 1885, it was no surprise when in 1886 that department was given to Lord Randolph's nominee, and Cross received the lighter India Office, being at the same time raised to the peerage as Viscount Cross of Broughton in Furness. His tenure of the India Office, which lasted until 1892, was uneventful, its only important piece of legislation being the <span class="roman">Indian Councils Act</span>, 1892, which enlarged the membership of the Indian legislative councils&#151;though without formally introducing the elective principle, which Cross opposed&#151;and proved highly successful. In 1895 he accepted the office of privy seal, which he retained until 1900, and he finally retired in 1902. After this his appearances in parliament were few, and he does not appear to have spoken in the Lords after 1909. He died on 8 January 1914, following a bronchial attack, at Eccle Riggs, Broughton in Furness, his family home since 1860.<br>
<br>Cross was a fellow of the Royal Society, a bencher of the Inner Temple, and an ecclesiastical commissioner, and was keenly interested in the affairs of the church. His honours included, besides the viscountcy, the GCB (1880) and GCSI (1892). He was among the small band of her ministers to whom Queen Victoria gave her close personal friendship, and he was a trustee of more than one royal marriage settlement. But the story that he was the queen's confidential business agent is unfounded. Very far from being a brilliant man, Cross was yet gifted with unfailing good sense; and he had the knack of securing the affection and trust of his subordinates. His speeches were of a type which the House of Commons listened to with respect rather than enjoyment, well-documented and clear statements such as might be made at a meeting of a business company. Only twice did he rise to a note of passion in oratory&#151;when introducing the <span class="roman">Artisans' Dwellings Act</span> (1875) and when repudiating on behalf of the cabinet the charge of indifference to the sufferings of Bulgaria. The latter speech (7 May 1877) contained a cogent defence of the whole policy of the government in the Eastern crisis, and created a widespread impression.<br>
<br>To Cross's reputation as an outstanding home secretary and a model of the hard-working, efficient departmental head has been added the suggestion that he and his Lancashire associates built on their local experience to pursue a version of tory democracy based on combination between the middle classes and the aristocracy to supply such social and administrative reform as would preserve paternalistic government against popular pressure. Cross however, was too pedestrian and, in Disraeli's and Salisbury's cabinets, too middle-class a figure to achieve more than moderate influence in the inner councils of his party.<br>
