<span class="headword">Scragg,  Thomas</span>  (1804&#150;1886), <span class="occ">drainpipe-machine manufacturer</span>, was born in Monks Coppenhall, Cheshire. Scragg was a common family name in Monks Coppenhall in the early nineteenth century, and two such named families had a son baptized Thomas in 1804 (on 17 June and 23 September). The husbands in both families were recorded as working in agriculture, as a farmer, and as a farm labourer. Thomas Scragg similarly found employment in agriculture, and by 1841 was bailiff for the Calveley part of the Davenport estate in Cheshire. By that time he lived in Calveley, 6 miles west of his birthplace, and was married to Mary (1806&#150;1884), from nearby Wardle. Employed at Calveley by Edward Davenport, Scragg developed his drainpipe-making machine in the early 1840s. In its ability to mass-produce cylindrical drainpipes, the most reliable of fills for under-drains, Scragg's invention made possible a reduction in the cost of under-draining and an improvement in its permanence and effectiveness. The machine became integral to the large-scale under-draining of waterlogged farmland that occurred in the second half of the nineteenth century and was one of the major technical advances in English agriculture between 1700 and 1900.<br>
<br>Waterlogging presented considerable difficulties for the effective use of agricultural land, and contemporary estimates of the area needing draining&#151;10 to 16.5 million acres&#151;indicated the scale of the problem. From the 1830s coherent systems of drain layout (known as deep thorough draining) were devised, initially by James Smith of Deanston but modified by Josiah Parkes, which were applicable to most conditions of soil wetness. Yet the full benefits of these draining systems were dependent on the use of a durable drain fill. Of available fills bushes, straw, and other vegetative material possessed but a limited life; stones and semi-circular, handmade tiles laid on soles, though more durable were subject to blockage and dislodgement. The cylindrical drainpipe represented a technical advance over other fills: easier to handle, with less likelihood of stoppage and displacement, and with great durability, they brought longevity, if not permanence, to the new draining systems.<br>
<br>Handmade but expensive drainpipes had been reported from various parts of the country at the end of the eighteenth century: John Read recorded making 3 inch diameter drainpipes in Kent in 1795. Several simple machines producing limited numbers of pipes were noted by 1840 in Suffolk, Essex, Kent, and Sussex. To facilitate the widespread use of drainpipes, these early machines had to be redesigned to provide standardization of form and to increase output, thereby reducing costs.<br>
<br>The first of these improved machines was credited to Scragg. In 1842 his machine was demonstrated to Parkes by Davenport at Capesthorne. The machine was exhibited to a wider audience at the 1845 Shrewsbury meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, where it was awarded the prize for the best drainpipe-making machine. Although Scragg's invention was followed swiftly by many others, Philip Pusey could report in 1851 that Scragg's machine had come to dominate, along with those of Henry Clayton and John Whitehead. Scragg continued to exhibit his machine at the Royal Agricultural Society's annual meetings until 1859, being awarded prizes in 1846, 1849, 1852, and 1856, and at the Great Exhibition in 1851.<br>
<br>With its ability to make 2500&#150;3000 pipes per day, the machine brought considerable price reductions: in 1845, 1 inch and 2 inch diameter pipes cost respectively 12<i>s</i>. and &pound;1 5<i>s</i>. per 1000. At these prices waterlogged land could be drained with the new draining systems at about &pound;5 per acre, permanent under-draining being obtainable at nearly the same cost as traditional methods. The effective under-draining of wet agricultural land in England was now possible.<br>
<br>Scragg made little attempt to develop other aspects of farm technology. Instead he diversified his occupational interests at Calveley, where he remained for the rest of his life. He added coal agency and drainpipe-machine manufacturing to land stewardship in the 1850s. After 1860 he concentrated on his commercial interests and from a 5 acre holding was described variously until 1878 as a coal merchant, a brick and tile maker and dealer, and a drainpipe manufacturer. He died on 6 November 1886 at the age of eighty-two at Edleston, in the adjacent parish of Acton.<br>
