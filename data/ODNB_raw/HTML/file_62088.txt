<span class="headword">Barr <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Moyles]</span>,  (Sarah) Venie</span>  (1875&#150;1947), <span class="occ">political activist and philanthropist</span>, was born at Abbeyleix, Queen's county, on 3 October 1875, the daughter of James Moyles, a trader, and his wife, Eliza Jane Pratt. On 2 July 1901 she married Ainsworth Barr (<i>d</i>. 1935), son of James Barr. Her husband, a rugby international, who as part of the Irish fifteen won the triple crown in 1899, was a solicitor and later a prominent Belfast stockbroker. They had two sons, Bruce and James. Marriage brought Venie Barr to Belfast, where she embarked upon what was to prove a lifelong involvement in Unionist politics.<br>
<br>In 1910 Venie Barr was appointed honorary secretary of the South Belfast Women's Unionist Association, a post she held until 1918, when she became chair of the St Anne's Women's Unionist Association. She was active in anti-home rule agitation between 1910 and 1914, and was one of the founder members of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council (UWUC), formed on 23 January 1911. The UWUC was intended to act as an auxiliary to the all-male Ulster Unionist Council (UUC), formed in 1905. Largely content to remain in the shadow of the UUC, the women's organization was nevertheless active on a broad range of fronts, taking a vigorous role in social welfare, propaganda, and fund-raising, during and after the war. In 1912 Barr was prominent in the organization of the &#145;women's declaration&#146; against home rule. This petition, the female counterpart to the male-only solemn league and covenant, collected 229,000 signatories in Ulster, an excess of 10,000 over the male petition. Barr was also a keen supporter of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a military organization formed in January 1913 to resist home rule. Although women were excluded from the ranks of the force, they were active as propagandists, clerks, fund-raisers, and nurses. She was appointed postmistress to the force, a position she held throughout the war years. These were among the busiest of her life, and she became deeply involved in charitable initiatives connected with the Ulster troops. She was one of the driving forces behind the Ulster women's gift fund, which sent parcels of food, clothing, and small gifts to prisoners of war and men at the front, and acted as the organization's honorary secretary from 1914 to 1918. She was appointed CBE (1920) in recognition of her work with the fund.<br>
<br>The post-war years brought no lessening of commitment to Unionist causes. In 1921 Barr became assistant honorary treasurer of the UWUC, and in 1923 she was elected vice-chair of the organization. In 1931 she became honorary treasurer, and she subsequently held both posts until her death. From 1919 she was a delegate to the UUC, presenting the Unionist women's perspective to the central male organization. Her addresses were noted for their confidence and fluidity. As a result of her war work Barr was concerned for those former servicemen and their families who suffered hardship after 1918, and she encouraged the co-operation of the UWUC with organizations such as the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families' Association during and after the war. She was also one of the Ulster representatives at the unveiling of the memorial to the 36th (Ulster) division at Thiepval on the Somme. She also acted as honorary secretary of the Belfast Council of Social Welfare, president of the Toc H Women Helpers (Belfast branch), and honorary treasurer of the Ulster Girl Guides. In the uncertain years following partition she assisted many young Ulster women to emigrate, mainly to Canada, and she travelled there in 1930 to both check on the progress of thirty-three women whom she had helped to move, and explore the possibilities for others.<br>
<br>The final years of Barr's life were dogged by ill health, although she continued her political work almost until the end, and resigned from the UWUC only a few months before her death. She died on 1 November 1947 at her home, Ravenna, 13 Malone Park, Belfast.<br>
