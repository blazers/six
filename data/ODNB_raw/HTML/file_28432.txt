<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waldby,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1335&#150;1397), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, is generally accepted as having come from Yorkshire. His ordination as priest in 1362 suggests a birth date of the mid-1330s, at the latest. He was related to the preaching friar John Waldby (<i>d</i>. 1372), probably as nephew or cousin rather than brother (as has been claimed). Of his early life nothing is known. He took orders, from acolyte to priest, in ordinations in York diocese between March 1361 and March 1362, when he was already an Augustinian friar. His epitaph links him with their house at Tickhill, but the ordination lists assign him to York. He is assumed to have attended the studium at Oxford, and (because he is called &#145;Tholosanus&#146; in 1382) to have moved on to Toulouse, possibly in accordance with Pope Urban V's instructions to the Augustinian friars in 1365 to send some of their students there. In 1383 he appears as both master of theology and <i>sacre theologie professor</i>; his epitaph also suggests legal education, and (unless mistranscribed) that he knew medicine.<br>
<br>Waldby's early administrative career is obscure, but probably focused on Aquitaine and service to Edward, the Black Prince (<i>d</i>. 1376). Later, on 1 April 1383, he was named among envoys to Aragon. On 20 August 1389 he was appointed keeper of the seal for the seneschal of Aquitaine, a post he still held in 1390. (The suggestion that he was chancellor of Aquitaine by 1389 seems to be based on a misreading.) This bureaucratic activity was rewarded on 4 June 1386, when Pope Urban VI (<i>r</i>. 1378&#150;89) made him bishop of Aire (not Sodor, as sometimes erroneously reported) by provision, his title sometimes being extended to Aire and St Quitti&egrave;re. Gascony had remained loyal to the Roman line of popes in the great schism, while most of France accepted the antipopes of Avignon. Aire was not a wealthy see; from 1388 Waldby supplemented his resources by acquiring the farm of various alien priories, whose endowments had been seized by the crown during the French wars. On 14 November 1390 he was translated to Dublin. He showed no anxiety to visit his new archbishopric, and on 30 October 1391 received royal permission to absent himself from Ireland for life. Although appointed chancellor of Ireland in February 1392 (the nomination being repeated in July), he remained an absentee; indeed, he is several times recorded as attending the king's continual council in the early months of that year. In March 1394 he received further permission to stay in England; but later that year joined Richard II's expedition to Ireland, and he briefly had custody of the Irish great seal in 1395. That year he was again involved in diplomatic activity, among the envoys to Charles VI of France whose negotiations resulted in Richard II's marriage to Isabella of France.<br>
<br>On 3 November 1395 Waldby was again translated, to Chichester. This was presumably to give greater access to Richard II, although Thomas Walsingham suggested additional advantages: the move entailed a drop in status, from archbishop to bishop, but Chichester was worth more than Dublin. Just under twelve months later he was moved once more, being provided on 5 October 1396 to succeed Thomas Arundel, who had been translated to Canterbury, as archbishop of York. The St Albans chroniclers report that his appointment was against the wishes of all the York clergy; but their veracity cannot be tested. A hostile verse does, however, hint at simony. As far as is known, he never visited York. The diocesan government was conducted solely by vicars-general, whose register is the sole survivor of the many Waldby's career must have generated (a register of his York <i>acta extra diocesim</i> never returned there). He died on 27 December 1397, probably in London (although the Kirkstall chronicler places his death at Gloucester, of a diseased shin bone), and certainly in financial difficulties. As a mark of royal favour he was accorded burial in Westminster Abbey, in the chapel of St Edmund and St Thomas the Martyr, where his funerary brass still exists.<br>
<br>Waldby was an active academic and campaigner against heresy. Bale ascribes to him several works that reflect his academic and theological careers: four books of lectures on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, a book of <i>quaestiones ordinariae</i>, a book of quodlibets, a book of sermons for the year, and (potentially most interesting of all) a volume <span class="italic">Contra Wiclevistas</span>, with &#145;alia plura&#146;  (Bale). None of these is now known to exist. In 1382 he was among the theologians at the Earthquake Council at Blackfriars which condemned ideas extracted from the works of Wyclif; and in 1392 he participated in the Council of Stamford. In 1391 he and other Irish bishops were given powers to arrest heretical preachers, although this may have been directed against preaching in support of the antipope Clement VII (<i>r</i>. 1378&#150;94) rather than doctrinal deviation. His benefaction to support the rebuilding of the chapel of University College, Oxford, was commemorated in a window inscription that survived until a later seventeenth-century rebuilding.<br>
<br>From the late 1380s Waldby's career was tied to his association with Richard II. The epitaph description of him as <i>medicus</i> has led to assertions that he was the king's personal physician. This seems unlikely: he clearly had other qualities that recommended him to Richard. Although praised by the historian of the York archbishops, Waldby remains a rather shadowy figure. Confusion with John Waldby has led to exaggeration of his intellectual activity; conversely, the apparent loss of all of his own works makes it extremely difficult to render a complete and accurate assessment of his contribution to church life in the latter part of the fourteenth century.<br>
