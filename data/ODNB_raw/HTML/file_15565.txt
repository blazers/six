<span class="headword">King,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1595&#150;1613), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the author of <span class="italic">An halfe-penny-worth of wit, in a pennyworth of paper, or, The hermites tale, the third impression</span> (1613). No earlier edition is known but it must have been printed some years previously. <span class="italic">Robin the Devil his two penniworth of wit in half a penniworth of paper, by Robert Lee, a famous fencer of London, alias Robin the Devil</span> (1607) is mentioned in West's sale catalogue of 1773 and may have been an earlier edition but it is not now known to be extant. A jocular, mock dedicatory epistle to the countess of Sussex is prefixed to King's poem. He acknowledges that his work is &#145;a course homespun linsey woolsey webbe of wit&#146; but, seeing his &#145;inferiours in the gifts of learning, wisedome, and understanding, torment the Print daily&#146;, he is &#145;the bolder to shoulder in amongst them&#146;  (King). This is followed by an address to the reader, three short copies of verses, and three anonymous sonnets; the second of which Thomas Corser cautiously attributed to either Thomas Nashe or Robert Greene. <span class="italic">The Hermites Tale</span> takes the form of a dialogue between a disillusioned hermit and a young man, concerning the vices and follies of the age, the growth of luxury, and the decay of hospitality. Puritan sensibilities are attacked in one part, and allusions are made to the legend of Robin Hood, to the works of Skelton, and to the activities of Richard Tarton  (sigs. D2<i>v</i>, E<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>King was the dedicatee of Anthony Chute's panegyrical tract <span class="italic">Tabacco</span>, printed posthumously in 1595. The author was a friend of Gabriel Harvey and this text, the first English work on the subject, testifies to King's exalted reputation among London smokers: &#145;What your experience is in this divine hearbe, al men do know, and acknowledge you to bee The Sovereigne of Tabacco&#146;  (Nicholl, 227).<br>
<br>Four years later Thomas Nashe dedicated his <span class="italic">Lenten Stuffe</span> to <blockquote>his worthie good patron, Lustie Humfrey, according as the townsmen doo christen him, little Numps as the Nobilitie and Courtiers do name him, and Honest Humfrey, as all his friendes and acquaintance esteeme him, king of the Tobacconists <i>hic &amp; ubique</i>, and a singular Mecaenas to the Pipe and the Tabour.</blockquote>At the end of the dedicatory epistle Nashe refers to the forthcoming &#145;sacred Poeme of the Hermites Tale, that will restore the golden age amongst us&#146;. This address reveals a burlesque and boisterous relationship between the two men&#151;&#145;A King thou art by name and a King of good fellowshippe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nashes Lenten Stuff</span>, sig. A3<i>r</i>)&#151;and emphasizes that although King himself was a poet he was an &#145;unlearned lover of poetry&#146;  (ibid., sig. A2<i>r</i>). In 1600 Nicholas Breton, under the guise of the imperfect anagram Salohein Treboun, dedicated his rare <span class="italic">Pasquils Mistresse, or, The Worthie and Unworthie Woman</span> to &#145;Lustie Humfrey, honest wagge&#146;  (Breton, sig. A2<i>r</i>), having been motivated by the desire to advise his good friend, who was evidently at that time considering the prospect of marriage.<br>
<br>Little is known of King's biographical details but it is possible that he could claim kinship with the King family of Halstead, Essex. Lusty Humfrey recurs as a frequent form of address, and several colleagues, as well as King himself, make reference to his uneducated state. His circle appears to have favoured punning uses of the poet's surname, a tendency adopted by King in an unpublished plea for unity to James I, entitled &#145;H. King to a King&#146;  (Corser, 339).<br>
