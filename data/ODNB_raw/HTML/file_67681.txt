<span class="headword">Fadipe,  Nathaniel Akinremi</span>  (1893&#150;1944), <span class="occ">writer and anti-colonialist</span>, was born on 2 October 1893 at Oko-Saje, Abeokuta, Nigeria, the son of the Revd L. O. Fadipe of the Baptist mission at Abeokuta; his mother was a successful market trader. As a child he was educated at church missionary schools. Later, dissatisfied with his poorly paid job as a clerk in the government secretariat, he moved to become personal secretary to the manager of Barclays Bank in Lagos.<br>
<br>In order to further his education Fadipe travelled to Britain. He gained a BA at the London School of Economics (LSE); on graduating in 1929 he was granted a fellowship for two terms at Woodbrooke, an international Quaker residential college in Birmingham. After further study of history and international relations there he was awarded a <i>testamur</i> certificate <i>cum laude</i>. In 1930, on a two-year fellowship from the Phelps Stokes Fund, he travelled to the United States; he spent a year at Columbia University, New York, and was awarded an MA. His dissertation, &#145;A Yoruba town: a sociological study of Abeokuta&#146;, was the first academic study of a Nigerian city by an African.<br>
<br>The offer of a teaching post at Achimota College, Legon, Gold Coast, drew Fadipe back to West Africa. Achimota, opened in 1926, was the first government-funded educational establishment to offer co-education from kindergarten to lower-level university. Apparently Fadipe met considerable hostility from the European staff, so that his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1934. His name is omitted from the histories of Achimota.<br>
<br>On returning to London, Fadipe enrolled at the LSE in 1934 for postgraduate study under professors Bronislaw Malinowski and Morris Ginsberg. Though in receipt of a fellowship only in his final year, he researched aspects of the political, social, and economic situation in some countries in Africa. It took him five years to gain his PhD. His was the first major sociological study by a Nigerian of the Yoruba; however, <span class="italic">The Sociology of the Yoruba</span> was not published until 1970.<br>
<br>Fadipe felt that the &#145;British public [was] most inadequately informed of Africa &hellip; [and] of the unjust conditions the Natives laboured under in many parts of Africa&#146;  (<span class="italic">West African Pilot</span>), and his writings, published in a number of British journals, aimed to address this ignorance. These included essays on Abyssinia and a six-part series on traditional and modern education. He also wrote about South Africa, discussed the evolution and effects of indirect rule, and considered plans for white settlement in post-war Africa. In addition he researched and wrote two papers for the West African Students' Union (WASU): a report on Nigerian land tenure (<i>c</i>.1939), written for distribution to the members of the unofficial parliamentary committee on west African economic conditions, and a thirty-six-page memorandum, &#145;Price control and living standards in West Africa&#146; (13 April 1940), which was sent to the government. The Colonial Office sent an amended version to the west African governments as a secret document  (TNA: PRO, CO 852/341/1). A work on the economic situation in Kenya, which he withdrew from the publishers for unstated reasons, had been commissioned by the Fabian Colonial Bureau.<br>
<br>Involved in anti-imperialist politics in London, Fadipe worked with WASU, the League of Coloured Peoples, and with militants such as George Padmore and Jomo Kenyatta. Naturally, he was also concerned with racism in Britain; his complaints in 1941 about harassment in air raid shelters and racial discrimination in employment exchanges invigorated previous discussions between the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Labour on the issue (TNA: PRO, CO 859/80/9; TNA: PRO, CO 859/40/15; TNA: PRO, CO 859/40/4). He also wrote for, and collaborated with, such white-run political organizations as the National Council for Civil Liberties, and worked with campaigners such as Dr Norman Leys, and Horace Alexander of the peace movement. His work was used by the Independent Labour Party, the Fabian Colonial Bureau, and the Labour Research Department. He was in contact with activists such as the African-American Ralph Bunche (later a Nobel laureate) and Nnamdi Azikiwe, a future president of independent Nigeria.<br>
<br>As there were no university research or teaching posts in London for which an African applicant would have received serious consideration, Fadipe was forced to earn his living as an examiner of students of the Yoruba language, as a marker of school examination papers, as a translator for the Ministry of Information, and as a clerk with Unilever. Inappropriate employment combined with total devotion to the cause of Africa led to gross overwork and resulted in a brain haemorrhage. Fadipe died on 1 June 1944 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London; he was buried at Hendon Park cemetery.<br>
<br>As the editor of the journal <span class="italic">West Africa</span> noted, Fadipe was &#145;one of the ablest and most balanced thinkers Nigeria has produced&#146;  (10 June 1944). He was held in &#145;great admiration for his intellectual powers and the fairness and justice of his opinions&#146;. His &#145;true place was a responsible one in the administration of his country [but] it is not really an inveterate habit of the Colonial Governments to seek out and prefer men of his independent, critical cast of mind&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
