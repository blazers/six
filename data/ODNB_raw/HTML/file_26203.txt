<span class="headword">Stafford, Sir  Edward</span>  (1552&#150;1605), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the first son of the Marian exile Sir William Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1556) and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69753/', "Dorothy Stafford (1526&#150;1604)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26205/', "Henry Stafford, tenth Baron Stafford")</script>, and granddaughter both of Edward, third duke of Buckingham, and George, duke of Clarence. With the death of Sir William in Geneva in May 1556, his widow removed to Basel with her three children (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26217/', "William Stafford")</script>), and remained there until Elizabeth's succession in England. From 1564 Dorothy's role as mistress of the robes and close confidante to the queen brought early advancement for her son Edward, though his financial condition, always parlous, did not improve measurably. He was educated at St John's College and Pembroke College, Cambridge. Under the patronage of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, Stafford was elected to parliament as member for Mitchell, Cornwall, in 1571; he sat for Heytesbury in 1572. The following year he became a gentleman pensioner of the court. In 1574 he acted as Burghley's courier of confidential letters to Emden and provided intelligence on the duke of Friesland's rumoured Spanish alliance. In 1576 he was dispatched to France on unspecified business, returning to court on 23 October.<br>
<br>In spring 1578 the duc d'Anjou renewed his suit for Elizabeth's hand in marriage. In May Stafford went to France to conduct negotiations on the queen's behalf with Henri III and &#145;monsieur&#146;, and appears to have befriended the turbulent duke. When Anjou came to England in August 1579 he stayed initially at Stafford's home. Upon three occasions in 1580, when the proposed marriage alliance faltered on the brink of failure, Stafford was sent to France to urge the king to offer better terms to the Huguenots as a condition of her acceptance.<br>
<br>At some time during the early 1570s Stafford had married Roberta Chapman, daughter of Alexander Chapman of Ragthorp, Norfolk, with whom he had a son and two daughters. In 1578 she died of complications arising from a fourth pregnancy, and on 29 November 1597 the widower married Douglas Sheffield, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howard (1547&#150;1608), sister of Charles Howard, second Baron Howard of Effingham, and spurned lover of the earl of Leicester. It has been suggested that, in making this match, Stafford sought to gain access to the income of the Sheffield estate during the minority of his wife's son. However, the marriage also buttressed his already close links with the queen: his new sister-in-law, Katherine, was Elizabeth's second cousin and closest female companion.<br>
<br>In 1583 Stafford was knighted and chosen to replace Lord Cobham as ambassador to Paris, having sought the position as a means to relieve a penury undented by a grant of revenue from undiscovered benefices in 1581. The prestigious appointment undoubtedly owed much to his relationship with the French royal family, but much also to his personal connections. He took this occasion to spurn Francis Walsingham's previously friendly advances, possibly because of the principal secretary's growing identification with the Leicester party at court, and place himself entirely under Burghley's political patronage, thus creating a dislocation of loyalties at the heart of Walsingham's sphere of interest&#151;his intelligence network. Stafford soon experienced the repercussions of his decision. Cobham was actively unhelpful in handing over the reins of his office; correspondence between Stafford, his own mother, and the queen was intercepted by Walsingham's agents; and Walsingham himself warned Stafford not to write to the queen too regularly, for the rather unconvincing reason that she objected to the postal charges. More seriously, Walsingham took notice of, and began to report, Stafford's heavy gambling in Paris and his increasingly desperate financial situation. In turn, Stafford deliberately bypassed Walsingham when sending intelligences from Paris. Dangerously, he also intruded upon existing operations supervised by Walsingham in Paris, and initiated his own subterfuges with a heavy and obvious hand. His subsequent drafting of intentionally inaccurate reports, in the hope of misleading Spanish agents, was hardly a novel device; it was, however, to blur the degree to which his actions were degenerating gradually into outright treachery. To meet some of his debts he accepted 3000 crowns from the duc de Guise for allowing him to see English diplomatic letters, and was in close communication with an English Catholic conspirator in Paris, Charles Arundel. With increasing forcefulness he also expressed his opinion that Mary Stewart should be made Elizabeth's heir, and there is at least one contemporary reference to him as a &#145;friend&#146; to Mary.<br>
<br>By spring 1586 Walsingham had been fully apprised of Stafford's actions by his spies in Paris; yet he did not move to impeach him, possibly because his own position at court had become less secure. Burghley, who remained Stafford's friend (though warning him of rumours of his actions), was a powerful guardian, and the absence from court of Leicester, failing abjectly in his Netherlands campaign, removed Walsingham's closest ally in the council. In October 1586 the death of Walsingham's heir, Sir Philip Sidney, seems to have been a personally traumatic event, which excited Burghley's sympathy and support, and encouraged a complete reconciliation between the two men. This may have benefited Stafford also. Walsingham and he exchanged letters during April 1587 which professed their desire for mutual harmony.<br>
<br>The timing of this <i>rapprochement</i> was fateful. Three months earlier Arundel had secretly acted as a mediator between Stafford and Bernadino de Mendoza, Philip II's ambassador in Paris, to offer Stafford's services as a spy. Money was certainly a motive; but so too, apparently, was Stafford's wish to be revenged for the perceived slights of Walsingham and Leicester. Arundel was given 2000 crowns to pass on to Stafford, and a clandestine&#151;and certainly an opaque&#151;relationship commenced.<br>
<br>Commentators have since expended much attention on the question of whether Mendoza's three pseudonyms for his English informers in Paris were references to three men, or to the same person: Sir Edward Stafford. Recently the latter case has been argued strongly, contradicting more venerable defences of the English ambassador's integrity. Certain facts are indisputable. Between April 1587 and October 1588, during the Anglo-Spanish war's most desperate phase, a stream of intelligences from Mendoza's English spy or spies gave advance warning of Drake's raid on Cadiz, of instructions for the concentration of the English fleet, and dozens of smaller, though useful, details of English diplomatic activity in Europe. Stafford definitely underplayed to London the scale of Spanish preparations against England in the months before the Armada sailed, though, equally, much information he passed to the Spaniards was partly or wholly inaccurate&#151;either intentionally so, or because Walsingham and others were tainting its flow. Stafford's inaccuracies may indicate simply that he was a poor intelligencer, and that Mendoza&#151;a very good one&#151;played him brilliantly. However, some of the information he is suspected to have supplied to his Spanish paymaster was undoubtedly damaging to English interests.<br>
<br>Following the Armada campaign Stafford gradually ceased to pass on information to Mendoza. It has been suggested that the cancelling of his large debts by the queen undermined his primary financial motive, while the deaths of both Leicester and Walsingham in 1588 and 1590 removed the principal sources of his rancour. He continued as ambassador in Paris until November 1590, when he was recalled. The voluminous evidence of his letters of this later period, principally regarding Henri IV's campaigns against the Catholic league (at several of which Stafford was present in the field), indicates that his industry did not abate with his putative treasons. Following his return to England he held no further major appointment, though he obtained the consolation of the perquisites of the remembrancer and pipe rolls offices. He was elected MP for Winchester in 1593, for Stafford in 1597 and 1601, and for Queenborough in 1604. He was said to have been promised the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster by Elizabeth, but the gift was not honoured by James I. Stafford died on 5 February 1605, and was buried in St Margaret's, Westminster. Several debts dating from the time of his French ambassadorship remained outstanding at the time of his death. He was survived by a son, William, from his first marriage. Two daughters born to his second wife died in infancy.<br>
<br>The evidence of Stafford's treachery, though substantial, remains circumstantial, and the precise degree of his culpability is difficult to establish. How far he willingly passed on genuine intelligence intended to harm his country, or, conversely, attempted to mislead his paymasters while relieving his gambling debts, cannot be determined until the matter of Mendoza's &#145;one spy or three&#146; is definitively settled. What is indisputable is that Stafford's profound sense of his own dignity (deriving in part from his near regal antecedents), his factiousness, and his intermittent feud with a man of equally elastic principles blurred his understanding of the bounds of self-interest and treason, or rendered them inconsequential. He was fortunate to have played his dangerous game at a time when Walsingham's footing had become less sure, and to have provided too little firm evidence upon which his downfall might otherwise have been arranged.<br>
