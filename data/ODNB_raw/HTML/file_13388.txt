<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hoare,  William</span>  (1707/8&#150;1792), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born near Eye, Suffolk, the eldest of the three children of John Hoare, a prosperous farmer and land agent. The family soon moved to Berkshire and William was sent to school in Faringdon where he showed an early talent for drawing. His father was persuaded to send him to London in the early 1720s, where he joined the studio of Giuseppe Grisoni, an Italian who had come to England in 1718. When Grisoni returned to Italy in 1728, he took Hoare with him. Once in Rome, Hoare shared lodgings in via Gregoriana with Peter Angillis, Laurent Delvaux, and Peter Scheemakers. He joined the studio of Francesco Imperiali, a history painter, and also frequented the studios of the French Academy nearby in the Corso. Personable and well educated, he formed lasting friendships with many young grand tourists who became his patrons: Henry Bathurst, the future third and fourth dukes of Beaufort, Robert Dingley, Henry Hoare (1705&#150;1785) (no relation), George Lyttelton, Charles Hanbury Williams, and Joseph Spence, tutor to the future second duke of Dorset and later to the earl of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Hoare returned to England in 1737 or 1738. He had connections with the entourage of Frederick, prince of Wales, and drew the <span class="italic">Prince's Portrait</span> in pastel (ex Sothebys, 11 April 1991, lot 28), but he did not prosper and decided to move to Bath, where his brother Prince (<i>d</i>. 1769) was a sculptor and where the Bath seasons were to furnish him with a constant stream of sitters. He quickly came to the notice of Beau Nash and Ralph Allen, whose portraits he painted in oil (1749, Bath corporation; 1758, Exeter Health Authority). In 1742 Hoare was elected a visitor to the Mineral Water Hospital, the duty of which he performed regularly until 1779. This appointment brought him many commissions and the hospital itself still contains a fine collection of Hoare's works, including <span class="italic">Self Portrait</span> (pastel, 1742) and <span class="italic">Dr Oliver &amp; Mr Peirce Examining Patients</span> (oil; exh. Society of Artists, 1761). He obtained a major commission for an altarpiece for the Octagon Chapel in Bath, <span class="italic">The Pool of Bethesda</span> (1765; Bath Masonic Hall Association). An habitu&eacute; of Stourhead, he furnished the younger Henry Hoare with many family portraits still <i>in situ</i>. On 4 October 1742 Hoare married at Lincoln's Inn chapel, London, Elizabeth Barker (<i>d</i>. 1793); they had five children: Mary (1744&#150;1820), who was also an artist, mainly in crayon, Anne (1751&#150;1821), William jun. (1752&#150;1809), the playwright and painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13384/', "Prince Hoare (1755&#150;1834)")</script>, and Georgiana (<i>b</i>. 1759), who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Many of Hoare's old Rome acquaintances had become his patrons, and a very substantial part of his income came from politicians' portraits (for example, <span class="italic">William Pitt the Elder</span>, <i>c</i>.1754; NPG), their replicas, and the fine mezzotints by Richard Houston commissioned after them. Hoare remained in close touch with the London art milieu. He was connected to the Foundling Hospital and to the Magdalen Hospital, to which he presented a <span class="italic">Portrait of Robert Dingley</span>, its founder, in 1762. In 1755 he joined others in signing a request for the founding of an academy. He first exhibited publicly at the Society of Artists in 1761 and in 1769 became a founder member of the Royal Academy at the king's special request, exhibiting intermittently [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. Hoare died in Edgar Buildings, Bath, on 10 December 1792, and his wife on 30 November 1793. There is a wall tablet to both in Walcot church, near Bath, and a wall monument to Hoare by Chantrey (1828) in Bath Abbey.<br>
