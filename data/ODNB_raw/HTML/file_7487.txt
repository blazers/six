<span class="headword">Denison,  Edward</span>  (1840&#150;1870), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, born at the palace, Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 8 September 1840, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7486/', "Edward Denison (1801&#150;1854)")</script>, bishop of Salisbury, and his first wife, Louisa Mary (1812&#150;1841), second daughter of Henry Ker Seymer of Hanford, Dorset. After some education at home Denison went to Eton College and to Christ Church, Oxford. Unfortunately, while at Eton, when training for a boat race, he overtaxed his strength and brought on congestion of the lungs, from which he never really recovered. He matriculated in 1858 from Christ Church, and in 1861 obtained a second-class degree in law and history, missing a first solely as a consequence of his bad health. From 1862 to 1866 he read for the bar at Lincoln's Inn, being called in 1868.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1864 Denison travelled through Italy and the south of France to Madeira and Tangier. While at St Moritz in Switzerland on his way back, he was deeply impressed with the habits and condition of the peasantry there. On his return to England he showed great interest in the state of the poor in the East End of London, and became almoner of the Society for the Relief of Distress in the District of Stepney. With a view to studying social questions from a practical point of view, he moved in the autumn of 1867 to a lodging in Philpot Street, Mile End Road, where he stayed for eight months, only occasionally visiting his friends in the West End. During that time he built and endowed a school, in which he himself taught <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes and gave lectures to working men.<br>
<br>Denison was one of the earliest members of the committees formed in 1869 by the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity (or the Charity Organization Society). Though he represented the moral rather than the political economy tradition in the society he favoured treating destitutes harshly and believed that charity was a chief cause of the housing crisis in London. In 1868 he went to Paris, and later to Edinburgh, to study the working of the poor law. In November 1868 he was elected for Newark, where his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7490/', "(John) Evelyn Denison")</script>, the speaker, lived. (He was his uncle's heir presumptive.) In May 1869, with his health declining, he visited the Channel Islands, whose political constitution he studied with great interest. In Guernsey he had an interview with Victor Hugo, who &#145;ranted&#146; at him for half an hour, and convinced him that &#145;with all his sublimity of imagination he was a bad politician and a worse reasoner&#146;. Further difficulties with his lungs forced him to abandon a projected visit with Sir Michael Hicks Beach to the United States, and he decided to make a voyage to Melbourne, where he hoped to study the questions of emigration and colonization. He left England in October 1869; the voyage made his health worse rather than better, and he died at Melbourne on 26 January 1870, within a fortnight of landing. He never married.<br>
<br>Denison's letters and other writings, edited by Sir Baldwyn Leighton, were published in 1872 (repr. 1875); they had considerable impact and he posthumously obtained something of the much greater influence attached to Arnold Toynbee. Denison House, the headquarters of the Charity Organization Society, perpetuated his name.<br>
