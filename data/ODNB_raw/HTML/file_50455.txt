<span class="headword">Lamb,  Patrick</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1708/9), <span class="occ">royal cook</span>, was the second of seven children of Patrick Lambe (1613&#150;<i>c</i>.1683) and Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Russell (<i>d</i>. 1687), of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Lamb's father was involved in victualling and in 1660 held a crown warrant as the sole retailer of tobacco in the precincts of Whitehall. Lamb's own career in the royal household began in or before 1661, as an untitled servant in the pastry, one of the chief departments of the household below stairs. In March 1662 he was granted the lowest named rank in this office, youngest child of the pastry, a position he held until September 1671. In April 1672 he appears in the kitchen ledgers as a child of the queen consort's kitchen. The humble title belies an increasingly profitable position; he not only received boardwages, but was also eligible to collect those fees and perquisites due to his position.<br>
<br>In August 1677 Lamb was appointed as master cook to the queen consort, held in tandem with the office of sergeant of his majesty's pastry in ordinary, to which he was elevated in November 1677. Finally, in February 1683, Lamb attained the status of master cook to the monarch. He was reappointed to this post under the successive household regulations of James II, William and Mary, and Anne, and was removed from it only by death. His services as a royal cook encompassed the provision of prepared dishes for daily and extraordinary consumption by the monarch and his guests at table. He also undertook provisioning contracts for the pastry and kitchen departments of the household, supplying commodities such as flour, eggs, and condiments. Lamb appears to have continued to hold his father's privileges in purveying wine, spirits, and tobacco at the court, revealed in a royal warrant of January 1683.<br>
<br>Lamb's culinary skills were most effectively demonstrated in extraordinary events, and his claims for large expenditures on such occasions as the Westminster visit of the Venetian ambassadors in December 1685 testify to the splendour of these. Most spectacular of all were his arrangements for the coronation feasts of James II in 1685, William and Mary in 1689, and Anne in 1702, recorded in extensive detail in the lord steward's accounts for those years. The 1689 coronation cost &pound;4931 to stage, and Lamb was presented with &pound;100 for his pains in its planning.<br>
<br>These and other junkets are evoked in the text of <span class="italic">Royal Cookery</span>, published posthumously in London under Lamb's name by John Morphew and Abel Roper in 1710, and subsequently reprinted in 1716, 1726, and 1731. The text incorporated recipes for elaborate dishes alongside engravings of lavish table layouts for occasions such as royal suppers. Such details suggest that the text was drawn from Lamb's papers, rather than being speculatively published under his name as some contemporaries contended.<br>
<br>Lamb married Mary Froswell on 28 October 1672 at St Marylebone Church, Middlesex. The couple had at least four children: Patrick, William, Mulys, and Mary. It is not known precisely when or where Lamb died, but it was some time between 25 September 1708 and 28 February 1709, probably in London. His wife predeceased him. There is no surviving memorial to Lamb, who was unusual in being an English cook at a time when French cooks were pre-eminent within English aristocratic households. <span class="italic">Royal Cookery</span> is nevertheless a testament to his culinary talents.<br>
