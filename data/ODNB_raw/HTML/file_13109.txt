<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hervey,  Augustus John</span>, third earl of Bristol  (1724&#150;1779), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born on 19 May 1724, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13116/', "John Hervey, Baron Hervey of Ickworth (1696&#150;1743)")</script>, courtier and politician, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13118/', "Mary Hervey, n&#233;e Lepell (1699/1700&#150;1768)")</script>, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13117/', "John Hervey, first earl of Bristol")</script>. He entered Westminster School in January 1733, and he probably remained there until May 1735 when he entered the navy as a captain's servant in the <i>Pembroke</i> (60 guns), commanded by his uncle, the Hon. William Hervey. He subsequently served in other ships as a midshipman. Early in the war of Jenkins's Ear (1739&#150;43) he was again with his uncle, this time in the <i>Superb</i> (60 guns). On 31 October 1740, after three quarrelsome officers had been dismissed from the ship, Hervey, aged sixteen, passed for lieutenant and was commissioned to fill a vacancy. Later that year a refit in the Tagus gave him the opportunity to initiate a Casanova-like campaign of amorous adventure, often involving young married women.<br>
<br>In 1741 Hervey took part in Vernon's attack on Cartagena. The capture in November of a Spanish vessel yielded him &pound;1500 in prize money which sufficed to settle his debts. In 1742 his intemperate uncle William was dismissed from the navy, but Hervey had already acquired a new patron, Captain the Hon. John Byng. A firm friendship began between these two contrasting characters, Hervey being of an impetuous, cocksure, convivial disposition and Byng of opposite tendency. In 1742&#150;3 Hervey was with Byng in the <i>Sutherland</i> (50 guns) and <i>Captain</i> (70 guns), and Byng much admired his professional flair.<br>
<br>While waiting in 1744 to go to Jamaica in Thomas Davers's flagship, Hervey contracted a reckless secret marriage which eventually became notorious. Having just turned twenty, he met in Hampshire <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5380/', "Elizabeth Chudleigh (c.1720&#150;1788)")</script>. Stemming from the Devon gentry, she was lively, beautiful, and a maid of honour to the princess of Wales but, as it transpired, was inclined to marital intrigue and promiscuity. Hervey married her before a few witnesses late at night on 4 August 1744 in the church at Lainston, near Salisbury. Hervey's finances were totally inadequate to support the marriage. A son was baptized Augustus Henry Hervey at Chelsea on 2 November 1747 but he soon died. By 1749 Hervey, alienated by reports of his wife's misconduct, had finally separated from her, but the marriage, though not widely suspected for many years, ultimately prevented him from acquiring a legitimate heir.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, on 16 September 1746, Hervey was promoted to command the sloop <i>Porcupine</i>, and on 15 January 1747 he was posted, prospectively as Byng's flag captain, to the <i>Princessa</i> (74 guns), which he justly deemed &#145;a glorious ship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hervey's Journal</span>, 47). He sailed for the Mediterranean where Byng finally decided to hoist his flag in the <i>Boyne</i> (80 guns). Byng sent the <i>Princessa</i> on three highly profitable cruises and, by the coming of peace in 1748, Hervey had accumulated prize and freight money to the tune of &pound;9000. He was naturally grateful to Byng and remained steadfastly loyal to him. Visits to various Italian ports allowed Hervey to engage in amorous affairs faithfully recounted in his richly informative, if tendentious, <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Meanwhile, however, at Leghorn in March 1748, he bravely went in his barge and boarded a burning merchantman, heavily laden with gunpowder, which no one else would approach. He cut her free and towed her clear of the mole and the many endangered ships and storehouses. Thereupon she blew up. Hervey's coat was burned but everyone escaped injury. The governor and the merchants thanked him for averting a calamity.<br>
<br>With the war ending Hervey, hoping to remain employed, shifted in May 1748 into the <i>Phoenix</i> (20 guns). However, he was ordered to pay off in England. While on half pay in 1749 he was unduly prominent among the officers who protested against the new <span class="roman">Navy Bill</span>. However, in 1752, thanks to Lord Anson's tolerance, he was reappointed to the <i>Phoenix</i>. In time of peace bullion and coinage still awaited safe transportation, and Hervey did well out of freight money. On the proceeds he much enjoyed himself among the ladies of Genoa, Naples, Leghorn, and Lisbon.<br>
<br>In July 1755 Hervey, while stationed at Genoa, began sending intelligence to the Admiralty of warlike French preparations at Toulon. In September he sailed to Minorca. Already many warnings had been received there of the impending French invasion. In February 1756, as the senior naval officer in Minorca, he tried to energize the governor's council. Then Commodore Edgcumbe arrived and sent him to Villefranche for intelligence. On 12 April he heard that the French had sailed from Toulon. By 16 May Hervey had joined Byng's fleet on its way up to Mahon. From the <i>Phoenix</i> (primed as a fireship) Hervey witnessed the battle of Minorca on 20 May. At Byng's subsequent council of 24 May Hervey alone among the captains argued that, though damaged, the fleet should remain off Minorca and land a reinforcement for the besieged garrison, but he did not persist with his dissent. Notoriously the fleet fell back on Gibraltar with dire consequences for Admiral Byng.<br>
<br>On 2 July Sir Edward Hawke superseded Byng at Gibraltar. Hervey, now in the <i>Hampton Court</i> (64 guns), favourably impressed Hawke during the fleet's unrewarding Minorcan cruise. In the autumn, having returned to England with officers required for Byng's court martial, Hervey wrote several pamphlets on the admiral's behalf and, at his trial, testified warmly in support of his isolated friend. Hervey campaigned in vain against the iniquitous death sentence. His <span class="italic">Journal</span> is enlivened by recurrent shafts of invective aimed at &#145;that prejudiced weak head&#146; Anson, &#145;that wasp of power and snake of ministerial dirt&#146; Lord Barrington, and &#145;that infernal black demon, Mr Fox&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hervey's Journal</span>, 239, 253).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1757 Hervey again commanded the <i>Hampton Court</i> in the Mediterranean, where Vice-Admiral Osborn accepted much of his advice on strategic matters. In July Hervey destroyed the French frigate <i>Nymphe</i> (32 guns) on the rocks of Majorca. In February 1758 his ship's slowness prevented Hervey from reaching the <i>Monmouth</i> (64 guns) before she silenced the mighty <i>Foudroyant</i> (80 guns). Captain Gardiner having died in the fight, Hervey soon afterwards shifted into the faster sailing <i>Monmouth</i>. In July he destroyed the French frigate <i>Rose</i> (36 guns) outside the grand harbour of Malta. By October he was back at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>In December 1758 Hervey went to Ickworth and, at great expense, entertained the corporation of Bury St Edmunds, which had made him a member. In May 1757 he had been elected a member of parliament for that family borough by 11 votes to 10; he took his seat in January 1759.<br>
<br>From May 1759 Hervey, again in the <i>Monmouth</i>, played a notable part in Hawke's all-important blockade of Brest. In July Hawke wished to tighten his blockade of the port and chose Hervey to command the inshore squadron. Hervey displayed great zest, resolution, audacity, and resource. On 22 July he earned Hawke's warm commendation when, by a characteristic bluff, he foiled a French attempt to loosen the British stranglehold. In October Hawke's fleet was blown off station, but Hervey's little squadron clung on. Hervey was now suffering from gout in both feet and, on 3 November, only a fortnight before the crowning triumph at Quiberon Bay, Hawke had to order the <i>Monmouth</i> to return home. &#145;I heartily regret your being obliged to go in&#146;, wrote the admiral  (Mackay, <span class="italic">Admiral Hawke</span>, 235).<br>
<br>In spring 1761, perhaps on account of ill health, Hervey was required to leave his ship, the <i>Dragon</i> (74 guns), and did not participate in the capture of Belle &Icirc;le. However, he resumed command in late August and from December he was with Rear-Admiral Rodney in the Leeward Islands. There he was active at the capture of Martinique and in February 1762 he was detached, as commodore, to take St Lucia. This he did with typical boldness, imagination, and skill. In the same year Hervey took a prominent and distinguished part in the capture of Havana. His attack from seaward on the commanding Morro Castle was a gallant, if unsuccessful, episode. Finally Hervey's share of the enormous prize money was &pound;1600.<br>
<br>His health somewhat impaired, Hervey began to turn away from the sea and seek advancement in politics. His seat at Bury was in the gift of his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13112/', "George Hervey")</script> who had succeeded as the second earl of Bristol in 1751, but Hervey disliked Bristol's political associates, notably Newcastle, Fox, and, until his death in 1762, Lord Anson. Hervey was at first attached to the friends of George III and was, on 6 November 1762, appointed colonel of the Plymouth division of marines, a near-sinecure worth &pound;800 a year. In February 1763 he vacated his seat at Bury but was elected for Saltash, an Admiralty borough, in December. Having been a loyal supporter of George Grenville's (1763&#150;5) ministry, Hervey avoided open opposition to Rockingham, though he did criticize the new administration's proposals for repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1766. Hervey was meanwhile designated commodore to command in the Mediterranean but for political reasons became instead a groom of the bedchamber, a post worth &pound;500 a year. In October 1766 Hervey was appointed secretary to his brother Lord Bristol, the lord lieutenant, and was sworn of the Irish privy council, but he never went to Ireland. In July 1767 he resigned, having quarrelled with his brother over his own continuing attachment to George Grenville. However, in 1767 Hervey moved in the Commons a badly needed increase in the half pay of naval lieutenants, and this was approved. In 1768 he was again elected a member for Bury; he held that seat until, on 18 March 1775, he succeeded his brother as earl of Bristol.<br>
<br>Meanwhile by 1767 Hervey was aiming for a seat on the Board of Admiralty, perhaps as first lord. He had for a long time been a member of Lord Sandwich's convivial set and shared the latter's strong interest in naval policy. At the end of 1770 Hervey encouraged Sandwich in his efforts to replace the ailing Hawke as first lord. In the wake of criticism of the unreadiness of the guardships during the Falklands crisis Hawke resigned in January 1771 and Sandwich was appointed in his stead. On 2 February Hervey became a lord commissioner at the Admiralty. He had a wide and trenchant knowledge of naval personnel and Sandwich openly acknowledged the value of his advice on the key matter of the guardships. Otherwise, however, he appears to have made no great contribution to the first lord's reforms. As the solitary naval lord, Hervey's record of attendance at the board, affected by ill health, was unimpressive. On succeeding to the peerage in 1775, Hervey resigned from the Admiralty. At the time of his ennoblement, Bristol was pilloried in a &#145;T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&#146; pen portrait for his ongoing relationship with the courtesan <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63409/', "Mary Nesbitt (1742/3&#150;1825)")</script> which had begun four years earlier, the couple living together at his properties in St James's Square, Westminster, and at Ickworth. The earl's divorce petition having been dismissed in 1779, he was prevented from marrying Nesbitt, whom in his will (for which she was an executor and legatee) he described as his &#145;dear valuable and best friend&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1059, fols. 98&#150;100).<br>
<br>As earl of Bristol, Hervey now had an income of over &pound;10,000 a year. In politics he veered away from his association with Sandwich and, in a long speech of April 1779 in the House of Lords, he recommended Sandwich's removal from his post. He even had the effrontery to extol the list of guardships bequeathed to Sandwich by Hawke. Meanwhile in 1775 he had been promoted to rear-admiral of the blue and he automatically progressed finally in 1778 to vice-admiral of the blue.<br>
<br>Largely on the strength of his <span class="italic">Journal</span> (covering the years 1746&#150;59 but not composed from his original records until 1767&#150;70) Hervey has emerged as a naval Casanova. Among contemporaries his reputation suffered through his having seemed to collude with his wife when she was declared a spinster, in February 1769, before an ecclesiastical court. In 1776 the House of Lords found her guilty of bigamy in her marriage of 1769 to the duke of Kingston. But it is for his remarkable seagoing record, especially in the Seven Years' War, that Hervey should be remembered.<br>
<br>Though quite small, he was lithe and athletic in appearance. Until gout supervened he loved singing, dancing, and pulling at an oar. His bearing was that of a haughty aristocrat and in most things he lacked moderation.<br>
<br>Hervey died of &#145;gout of the stomach&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hervey's Journal</span>, xi) at St James's Square, London, on 23 December 1779 and was buried at Ickworth five days later. The title and estates passed to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13111/', "Frederick Augustus Hervey (1730&#150;1803)")</script>, but Hervey alienated from him as much wealth as he could. He thus provided for his ultimate mistress, Mary Nesbitt, and for &#145;little&#146; Augustus Henry Hervey (1764?&#150;1782), his natural son by Kitty Hunter (later the wife of Sir Alured Clarke).<br>
