</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Onslow, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1601, <em>d.</em> 1664), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 30 July 1601, the second son of Sir Edward Onslow (<i>d</i>. 1615) of Knoll in Cranleigh, Surrey, and Isabel Shirley (<i>d</i>. 1630), daughter of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex. Richard succeeded to the family estates on the death in December 1616 of his elder brother, Sir Thomas Onslow. He matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1617 and entered Lincoln's Inn on 8 November 1618. In 1620 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter and heir of Arthur Strangways of Holborn Bridge, London; they had six daughters and eight sons. He was knighted on 2 June 1624, was colonel of horse in Surrey by July 1626, a Surrey JP by December of that year, and a deputy lieutenant by the following March.<br>
<br>Onslow served as knight of the shire for Surrey in the parliament of 1628 and in both the Short and Long parliaments. In January 1642 he was one of the commissioners who met at Guildford to determine the bounds of Windsor Forest in Surrey, following representations from local residents who were anxious to free the parishes of north-west Surrey from forest law. The commission, which sat in contravention of an order of the House of Lords for the meeting to be postponed owing to the prevailing conditions of political instability, found that no part of Surrey except Guildford Park lay within the bounds of the forest.<br>
<br>Onslow was removed from the commission of the peace on 19 July 1642, but he attended the assizes at Kingston in August in order to serve parliament's arrest warrant on Justice Mallet. In September and October he was active in raising forces in the county for parliament. His house was plundered when the king's army entered Surrey in November. Following the death in December of Anthony Fane, Onslow emerged as the dominant figure among Surrey's parliamentarians, and was chiefly responsible for the moderate and conciliatory policies adopted by the county's parliamentarian administration. He was later praised by one Surrey royalist for striving &#145;to prevent and stop (to his utmost capacity) the rapines and oppressions of those times of Blood and Violence&#146;  (E. Andrews, <span class="italic">Gratitude in Season</span>, 1661, 6), while the poet George Wither was to accuse him of being &#145;the greatest Favourer of Delinquents, and the most implacable Enemy to them, who are eminently Well-affected to the Parliament, of any man in Surrey&#146;  (G. Wither, <span class="italic">Justitiarius justificatus</span>, 1646, 11). Although Onslow was a committed presbyterian, and was instrumental in attempts to establish a classical system in Surrey, he gained a reputation for protecting ministers who faced ejection, including the rector of Albury, William Oughtred, who dedicated the 1647 edition of his <span class="italic">The Key of the Mathematicks New Forged and Filed</span> to Sir Richard and his son Arthur. Onslow was also active, as a trustee for the earls of Arundel, in protecting the Howards' property interests in Surrey during the civil war.<br>
<br>Onslow's authority in Surrey was challenged in mid-1643 by rival parliamentarians, led by Sir John Maynard, who sought to increase the county's contribution to the war effort. Maynard and his allies gained temporary control of the Surrey county committee in July 1644, while Onslow was absent from the county as commander of the Surrey regiments at the siege of Basing, but their attempt to place George Wither in command of the militia forces of Surrey's east and middle divisions proved unsuccessful. Maynard was removed from the county committee at the end of August, and in March 1645 his kinsman Colonel Samuel Jones was forced to relinquish his command of Farnham Castle. An ordinance of parliament of 1 July 1645 led to the creation of a new committee dominated by Sir Richard and his supporters. The successful outcome of these disputes owed much to the support that Onslow obtained from the earl of Northumberland, the county's lord lieutenant, and from the middle group in parliament.<br>
<br>In April 1646 George Wither's belated attack on Onslow in <span class="italic">Justitiarius justificatus</span> included the accusation that Sir Richard had sought to betray the parliamentarian cause. The pamphlet was voted false and scandalous in the House of Commons on 7 August, and Wither was fined &pound;500 and imprisoned, but a subsidiary charge relating to his claim that Onslow had sent &pound;500 to the king at Oxford went unpunished.<br>
<br>Onslow was named to the revived committee of safety on 11 June 1647, and again on 30 July, but it is doubtful whether he played any significant part in its activities. On 1 June 1648 he was appointed a member of the Derby House committee, and later that month he was nominated by the Commons to the joint committee to consider terms for a personal treaty with the king. He was imprisoned briefly at Pride's Purge, but he remained on the Surrey bench and continued to attend meetings of the county committee. Although he was said in April 1651 to be &#145;fierce upon the Presbyterian score and also upon the King's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.582), he was active as a militia commissioner and commanded the Surrey regiment which was raised in July 1651 to resist the Scottish invasion.<br>
<br>Sir Richard Onslow sat for the county of Surrey in both the first and second protectorate parliaments. In April 1657 he was prominent in moves to persuade Cromwell to accept the crown, arguing that a king was more accountable than a protector, and in December he was made a member of Cromwell's upper house. He withdrew from national affairs following the fall of Richard Cromwell, but remained active as a JP until the autumn. At the recall of the secluded members of the Long Parliament in February 1660 he was appointed a member of the new council of state. He stood with his son Arthur for the county seats at the elections to the Convention Parliament in April, but lost, partly as a result of local hostility to presbyterians and partly, as his kinsman Denzil Holles suggested, &#145;by his owne fault, for he was offred one place, but he desired them both, for himself and his sonne, and so hath lost both&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32679, fol. 9<i>v</i>). The Onslows were able to sit instead for the town of Guildford.<br>
<br>By July 1660 Sir Richard had been removed from the commission of the peace in Surrey, and attempts were made to exclude him from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. The reasons given for this included his involvement in the arrest of Judge Mallet in 1642, his military activities during the civil war and in 1651, and his having compared Charles I to a hedgehog. He succeeded in obtaining a pardon on 5 November 1660. In May 1661 he was elected, again as burgess for Guildford, to the Cavalier Parliament, of which he became an active member. He was restored to the Surrey bench and attended quarter sessions regularly between April 1662 and his death in 1664.<br>
<br>Onslow's great-grandson, Speaker Arthur Onslow, was to describe him as &#145;a man of high spirit, of a large fortune and great parts, knowledge and courage, with the gravity and sobriety of the times&#146;. He &#145;had a sort of art and cunning about him&#146; which could, he suggested, &#145;only be justified by the uncertainty and confusion of the times he lived in, which made it very difficult for a man to act in them, whose principles did not lead him to the extremes of any party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 476, 482). Onslow died on 19 May 1664 at Arundel House, the Strand, Middlesex. Although William Mountague believed that the cause of death was a gangrene brought on &#145;by the relics of an ague, which settled in his thigh&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 1.315), most accounts suggest that he died after being hit by lightning. In his will, which was completed in March 1664, he described himself as of West Clandon, Surrey, where the seat he had purchased from Sir Richard Weston in 1642&#151;subsequently his main residence&#151;was situated. The bequests in his will included &pound;2500 to his unmarried daughter Elizabeth, and &pound;1000 each to his sons Richard and Denzill and granddaughter Mary. He was buried in Cranleigh church and was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur Onslow.<br>
