<span class="headword">Cort,  Henry</span>  (1741?&#150;1800), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was born in Lancaster and is usually assumed to have been the son, or another relation, of Henry Cort (<i>d</i>. 1747), a mercer and former mayor of Kendal. His exact date of birth is not known. According to the ambiguous inscription on his tombstone he died in &#145;the 60th year of his age&#146;, and 1740 has traditionally been accepted as the year of his birth. However, on the occasion of his first marriage, to Elizabeth Brown of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Holborn, whom he married at Crowhurst in Surrey on 21 April 1764, Cort gave his age as twenty-two, suggesting that he was born between 21 April and 23 May 1741. Whatever the circumstances of his birth, by 1757 he was working as a clerk to a naval agent in London, was in partnership as &#145;Batty and Cort&#146;, naval agents, by 1761, and from 1763 practised on his own. Naval agents were responsible for the disbursement of pay, allowances, and prize money to crews in the Royal Navy. His second marriage, in 1768, to Elizabeth Haysham (<i>d</i>. 1816), the daughter of Thomas Haysham, a steward to the duke of Portland, involved him more closely with the provision of naval supplies, and naval ironware in particular. His new wife's uncle, William Attwick of Gosport, Hampshire, owned a forge at Gosport, from where ironwares were supplied to the royal dockyard at Portsmouth. In time, Henry Cort invested in the Attwick business and by May 1776 he took over its management, hoping to aggrandize the lucrative market for naval ironware.<br>
<br>At his mill at Fontley, near Fareham, Cort began to experiment with the techniques of rolling and refining iron for which he was to be renowned. His use of grooved rolls to produce hoops and bars of iron was the subject of his first patent (no. 1351) in 1783. Rolling allowed the production of malleable bar iron with a speed and uniformity of finish that was unattainable with the forge hammers that had previously been employed for the purpose. The process described in his second patent (no. 1420) in 1784 involved the use of coal as fuel in the decarburization of pig iron and its conversion thereby from a brittle material into a malleable iron. This process centred upon the stirring about and turning over of molten metal in the hearth of an air furnace so as to expose the iron evenly to an oxidizing current of air&#151;hence the term &#145;puddling&#146;. The effect of Cort's endeavours was to bring to an end the long search for an effective and expeditious coal-based refining technique, thus freeing the iron trade from its dependence upon charcoal as a source of energy. Together, the puddling and rolling methods made for an enormous increase in forge capacity and established the global supremacy of the British iron industry in the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Cort publicized his patent methods extensively in the mid-1780s, staging demonstrations and tests at ironworks in the midlands and Scotland and in the royal dockyards. In the late 1780s the first large-scale application of puddling and rolling was under way at the Cyfarthfa works of Richard Crawshay in Glamorgan. And when in April 1789 the Navy Board advertised its new bar-iron contracts, it stipulated that only iron manufactured according to Cort's patents would be considered. At this point, however, nemesis struck. His developmental work had been funded by an old associate, Adam Jellicoe, deputy paymaster of the navy, whose son Samuel was Cort's business partner. Jellicoe senior had advanced money from the official balances in his hands to Messrs Cort and Jellicoe. In July 1788 these questionable transfers had been discovered and in August 1789 the treasurer of the navy moved to recover &pound;27,500 from Cort. His property and goods were seized by the crown, leaving him unable to meet the demands of his other creditors. He was gazetted bankrupt in October 1789. The intervention of his friends helped him pay his creditors and he obtained a certificate of conformity from them in April 1790, allowing him to live as though his bankruptcy was discharged. His friends also secured a pension of &pound;200 per annum for him from the government in 1794, but he remained an undischarged bankrupt until his death at lodgings in Devonshire Street, London, on 23 May 1800. He was buried in Hampstead churchyard. His second wife, the mother of his thirteen children, survived him.<br>
<br>Cort's patents were forfeit to the state at the time of his bankruptcy, though the government made little or no effort to collect the royalties due. As a result the British iron industry was able to exploit Cort's processes unhindered; in recognition of this, the leading British ironmasters were persuaded to enter into a subscription for his widow's benefit in 1811. The following year Cort's sons petitioned the House of Commons for some recompense for their father's efforts in developing puddling, which, they asserted, had proved such a vital element of national prosperity. A committee of the house investigated the matter. Several witnesses were examined, the most damaging of whom, Samuel Homfray of Merthyr, had been one of the earliest users of the puddling technique. Homfray denied the novelty and worth of Cort's contribution to metallurgy, and the petition of his sons was rejected accordingly. However, Homfray's testimony was disingenuous. Although it was true that Cort's methods had to a degree relied upon an ingenious adaptation and concatenation of techniques already in experimental use in the iron trade, most of his peers had no doubt of the genuine originality of his contribution. It was puddling and rolling, not one of the rival techniques current in the 1780s, which remained the basis of iron refining for decades afterwards, until wrought iron was superseded by mass-produced steel in the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
