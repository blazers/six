<span class="headword">Tate,  Francis</span>  (1560&#150;1616), <span class="occ">judge and antiquary</span>, was born at Gayton, the eldest son of Bartholomew Tate (<i>d</i>. 1601) of Delapr&eacute;, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of Francis Tanfield of Gayton. He was raised with two brothers and four sisters at nearby Hardingstone, on monastic lands bought by his father. He matriculated as a commoner to Magdalen College, Oxford, on 20 December 1577, but left without a degree. Admitted to Staple Inn by 1579 he entered the Middle Temple with his brother William on 2 June 1579, and was called to the bar on 30 June 1587. An active member, he was never fined for missing a duty or report, and preferred for admission many young men from east midlands families, several of whom became judges. He was patronized in his legal career by the Tanfield family, his sister's having married Sir Laurence Tanfield, chief baron of the exchequer.<br>
<br>A noted scholar at Magdalen, Tate became a famous legal antiquary at the Temple, where he was renowned for his knowledge of Anglo-Saxon and medieval laws and customs. He was elected bencher and Lent reader in 1607, and assisted in drafting the inn's new perpetual charter of 13 August 1608. Active in its parliament he sat on many committees including treasury, library, surveyors, discipline, and house rules and orders, becoming treasurer on 24 November 1615. He constructed a three-storey brick building over the cloisters between the Middle and Inner temples in Vine Court in 1612 at his own expense, keeping three chambers for his library and use. As a resident he was active in moots and readings. Numerous copies exist of his notes on lecturers, and his own reading on tithes was erudite in canon, civil, and common law, history and philology.<br>
<br>Tate was returned to parliament for Northampton in 1601, and served as its legal counsel by 1602. He sat for Shrewsbury 1604&#150;11 even though the borough ordered that it should not elect a non-resident. A scholar of parliamentary history he believed that the three parts of king, Lords, and Commons always had an equal role. He also placed great store in the statutes of the thirteenth century, especially <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. Providing Sir Edward Coke with a volume of abstracts from the rolls of parliament, his views supported the later arguments of Coke on the &#145;high court of parliament&#146;  (Fussner, 83&#150;4) and its antiquity. An active speaker, he sat on several committees including impositions and grievances. For example, in the debate on scutage on 4 December 1606 he gave a history of the divisions of feudal tenures. He gave similar lengthy lectures on the history of impositions. He had observed that privy councillors took the initiative in guiding and controlling the Commons in Elizabeth's reign, and were most effective when they worked through unconnected MPs, using flattery and friendly persuasion.<br>
<br>A judicial career paralleled Tate's time as scholar and parliamentarian. He was a JP in the counties of Brecknockshire, Glamorgan, and Radnor, and a justice of assize for Brecon 1604&#150;16. He also practised in the court of wards, and in king's bench 1610&#150;12. An original member of the Society of Antiquaries he was for some time its secretary. He maintained a collection of the society's papers, including a journal of its activities 1590&#150;1601. Tate was an inveterate collector. He spent many hours in London's Guildhall Library copying legal manuscripts, and took many of them, which were not returned and ended up in Sir Robert Cotton's library with some of his notebooks. He also researched state archives such as the exchequer, where he also borrowed original papers. Working with Cotton, William Lambarde, John Stowe, and John Jones of Gallilyfdy, he acquired the largest private collection of legal manuscripts of his time.<br>
<br>Approximately sixteen original works stemmed from his pen, none of which was printed in his lifetime, although ten were published later by either Thomas Hearne or John Gutch. They dealt with the antiquity and precedents concerning arms, cities and towns, combats, and funerals; with parliament and Star Chamber; with the offices of knights, doctors of civil law, serjeants, high steward, and lord chancellor; with words and names in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> and Northamptonshire; and with the ancient Britons. None of these was substantial apart from his tract on parliament. He was also the translator and / or editor of fourteen works, only one of which has been published. These were primarily medieval, ranging from household and wardrobe accounts to charters, statutes, and legal treatises.<br>
<br>Tate's career might never have blossomed had he not recovered from an illness in 1602 and left Northamptonshire that year for Wales, the ancestral homeland of his grandfather John Tate (<i>d</i>. 1514), mercer, and sheriff of London in 1495. On giving up his post as recorder of Northampton he made his will, on 22 June 1603. He gave praise to his sister Jane in caring for his &#145;illness&#146;  (PROB 11/129), and to his brother-in-law William, Lord Zouche of Harringworth. He had returned, however, by 1604, when he was elected MP for Shrewsbury. There is a significant omission of his name in the <span class="italic">Middle Temple Records</span> from June 1601 to February 1605. Tate died, probably at Middle Temple, on 15 November 1616. He gave most of his books to his nephew Robert Tanfield and many of his manuscripts landed in the Stowe collections, now in the British Library.<br>
