<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Thomas</span>  (1655/6&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born at Gilling in Yorkshire on 24 October 1655 or 1656 and was almost certainly the son of Nicholas Fairfax (1606&#150;1657) and his wife, Isabella Beckwith. After his education at the English College, St Omer, he entered the noviciate of the Jesuits at Watten on 7 September 1675 and was ordained priest on 18 December 1683. In 1685 he was professing Hebrew at the Jesuit college at Li&egrave;ge and preparing himself to teach philosophy. With the accession of James II it was decided to try to obtain a footing for Catholics in Oxford and it was considered essential by the English Jesuit superior, John Keynes, that some who might lecture in the university should obtain academic degrees. Thus Fairfax was sent with one or two others to Tr&egrave;ves, where they obtained doctorates &#145;after due examination and much expense&#146;  (Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu, MS Literae Annuae, Anglia 35, fol. 110<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>At Oxford Obadiah Walker had opened a Catholic chapel in University College and Dean Massey another at Christ Church but it was at Magdalen that the king hoped to obtain admission for Catholics and that they would be able to take degrees there. At the king's insistence, despite the opposition of the fellows, of whom twenty-five were expelled, Samuel Parker, bishop of Oxford, was elected president of the college. Fairfax and other Catholics (some of them priests) were by the king's instructions admitted as fellows on 9 January 1688 and Fairfax was nominated dean of arts. It was reported that he was appointed professor of philosophy and was teaching oriental languages. On the death of Bishop Parker in March 1688 Dr Bonaventure Giffard, one of the newly appointed vicars apostolic, was nominated president by royal mandate.<br>
<br>In 1688 there was printed on Obadiah Walker's press at University College Fairfax's <span class="italic">Some reasons tendred to impartial people, why Dr Henry Maurice, chaplain to his grace of Canterbury, ought not to be traduc'd as a licenser of a pamphlet entitled, A plain answer to a popish priest, &amp;c</span>. It was subjoined to <span class="italic">Twenty-One Questions Further Demonstrating the Schism of the Church of England</span> and was written in reply to the Revd Abednego Seller's <span class="italic">Plain Answer to a Popish Priest, Questioning the Orders of the Church of England</span> (1688). To a second edition of this pamphlet Seller annexed <span class="italic">An Answer to the Oxford Animadverter's Reflections</span> (1688). The revolution brought the controversy to an end.<br>
<br>In July 1688 Fairfax wrote to a correspondent, probably Dr Nathaniel Johnston, of the resistance the expelled fellows had made to the king's demands on the grounds that they were against the statutes of the college. He remarked that in the past the statutes had not been observed in a number of ways. The king, in October, in view of the deterioration of affairs, instructed the bishop of Winchester, the visitor of the college, &#145;to settle that society regularly and statutably&#146;  (Bloxam, 252&#150;3). The expelled fellows were returned at the end of October and Fairfax and his colleagues were removed. Fairfax narrowly escaped being murdered in the streets of Oxford and was imprisoned for about a year. On his release, after visiting his native Yorkshire, he returned to Li&egrave;ge to teach theology. He was professed of the four vows in 1693. For much of the rest of his life he was stationed in London managing the financial business of the English Jesuits. During these years he may have published translations of attacks on Jansenism; certainly his former colleague Bonaventure Giffard was among those who considered him among the first to introduce the controversy to English Catholicism. He may have translated <span class="italic">The Secret Policy of the Jansenists</span> by &Eacute;tienne Agard de Champs (or Deschamps), &#145;one of the most virulent attacks on Jansenism&#146;  (Blom, 6), of which an expanded edition was published in 1702, and <span class="italic">A Case of Conscience</span> (1703). From about 1710 Fairfax was at Wardour Castle in Wiltshire and there, it is believed, he died on 2 March 1716.<br>
