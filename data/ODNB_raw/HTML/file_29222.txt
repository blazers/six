<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitaker,  John</span>  (1735&#150;1808), <span class="occ">historian</span>, son of James Whitaker, innkeeper, was born in Manchester on 27 April 1735. He attended Manchester grammar school from January 1745 until 1752, when he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, with a school exhibition. On 2 March 1753 he was elected a Lancashire scholar of Corpus Christi College and became a fellow on 21 January 1763. He graduated BA on 24 October 1755, MA on 27 February 1759, and BD on 1 July 1767. He was ordained at Oxford in 1760 and acted as curate successively at Newton Heath chapel, near Manchester (1760&#150;61), and at Bray in Berkshire. He was elected FSA on 10 January 1771, and in the same year published the first volume of <span class="italic">The History of Manchester</span>, in quarto, covering the British and Roman periods. A second edition was published in octavo in 1773 with a quarto volume of the &#145;principal corrections&#146; to the original. The second volume, which extended as far as the Saxon period, was published in 1775 in quarto. A copy of Whitaker's manuscript of the continuation to the fifteenth century is in Chetham's Library, Manchester.<br>
<br>Whitaker deliberately took a very broad approach to the history of his native town&#151;he was a stout critic of the limitations and parochialism inherent in the &#145;private and dull annals&#146; of local history  (J. Whitaker, <span class="italic">The History of Manchester</span>, 2nd edn, 4 vols., 1773, 1.ix) and instead placed the history of Manchester within the much broader context of the early history of the British people in general. The history received a mixed reception&#151;some readers welcomed the wide range and accessible prose and recognized the substantial amount of erudition behind it; others cavilled at his extravagant generalizations, his unsubstantiated assertions, contrived reasoning, and the strongly tory flavour of his views. Francis Douce's view of Whitaker, noted on his annotated copy of the <span class="italic">History</span>, now in the British Library, was that he was a &#145;bully, brute and blockhead&#146;  (ibid., 2.1, BL, C. 28.1.6, 7). John Collier (Tim Bobbin) satirized the history in two tracts published in 1771 and 1773.<br>
<br>Whitaker's next publication responded to the current fashionable interest in the early inhabitants of the British Isles that had been fuelled by the Ossian controversy. <span class="italic">The Genuine History of the Ancient History of the Britons Asserted</span> (1772) was written in refutation of James Macpherson's <span class="italic">History of Great Britain and Ireland</span>. This work confirmed Whitaker's reputation as a controversial and provocative polemicist and his penchant for merciless <i>ad hominem</i> attacks on those from whose opinions he differed. From November 1773 to February 1774 he held the morning preachership at Berkeley Chapel, London, but left it following a dispute, concerning which he published a typically intemperate <span class="italic">State of the Case</span>, leading to the threat of a libel suit. While in London he made the acquaintance of Dr Johnson and Edward Gibbon, with whom he continued to correspond after he left London. Gibbon allowed him to read the first volume of <span class="italic">Decline and Fall</span> in manuscript, which Whitaker greeted with great enthusiasm. Gibbon had, however, withheld the chapter on Christianity, which Whitaker later read with high indignation.<br>
<br>From London, Whitaker moved back in 1774 to Manchester, where he became involved in disputes over the proposed improvement of the town; this gave rise to another ill-tempered paper war over the improvement bill in 1776. He endeavoured to persuade Gibbon, at that time MP for Liskeard, to use his influence to secure restraining clauses in the bill. Meanwhile he remained true to his tory principles, composing an ode to promote the formation of the Manchester regiment intended to reduce the American rebels.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1777 Whitaker was presented by Corpus Christi College to the rectory of Ruan Lanyhorn, Cornwall. Soon afterwards he married Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1742, <i>d</i>. 1828), daughter of the Revd John Tregenna, rector of Mawgan in Pyder, Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth; they had three daughters. He was an active parish priest and JP, and a forceful figure within the local community. The first ten years of his rectorship were blighted by disputes with his parishioners, who failed to see eye to eye with him on the divine right of tithes. At length he was victorious, and commented that he had his parish in a better state of subjection and amity towards him than any of his neighbours. For many years Whitaker hankered after the wardenship of Manchester collegiate church&#151;a position in which he believed he would be able to employ his talents to the full, and counteract the spread of heretical dissent and radical opinions in Manchester. Despite endless lobbying of political patrons, including Pitt, his ambitions were never realized. He also struck up a friendship with the bishop of Derry, from whom he similarly had high hopes of preferment in Ireland for a time. He blamed his failure to secure preferment in his native town upon the poor reception which his history of Manchester had received there, but the inhabitants had some cause at least to be grateful to him when, in 1787, he published <span class="italic">The Charter of Manchester Translated, with Explanations and Remarks</span> at the request of a committee engaged in vindicating the rights of the town against the lord of the manor (in return for which he was presented with a silver cup). In the same year he threw himself into historical controversy with his <span class="italic">Mary Queen of Scots Vindicated</span>, in which he denied the authenticity of the casket letters, championed the cause of Mary, and incriminated her enemies, particularly Elizabeth. A second edition was published in 1790. Throughout the rest of his life he compiled material for a &#145;Private life of Mary queen of Scots&#146;, originally begun as commentary to accompany engravings which he had collected of the queen, but it remained unpublished until George Chalmers, a long-time friend and correspondent, used the material (much of which had in any case originally been supplied by him) in his own life of the queen, published in 1818.<br>
<br>Whitaker reacted strongly to the turn of events in France during the 1790s. In 1791 he published the <span class="italic">Origin of Arianism Disclosed</span>, in which he warned his readers against the spread of inflammatory ideas of liberty, and attributed the origins of the Arian heresy to the Jews. Appalled by the course of the riots in Birmingham and in Manchester, which he attributed solely to the spread of libertarian ideas and heresy, he proposed to write a history of the disorders, but found himself pre-empted. There was more in a similar vein in <span class="italic">The Real Origin of Government</span> (1795), originally written as a sermon against the French Revolution. His hopes that this overtly authoritarian pamphlet would secure him preferment from Pitt's government were disappointed. By this time Gibbon's anti-Christian stance had come to seem ever more inimical to Whitaker's extremely orthodox sensibilities, and in 1791 his comments were published in a compilation of reviews from ten issues of the <span class="italic">English Review</span>. As with so much of Whitaker's <i>&#339;uvre</i>, some legitimate criticisms were overshadowed by absurd generalizations and vicious personal invective. On the historical side he made an early attempt at interdisciplinary history, combining a study of history and geography, published as <span class="italic">The Course of Hannibal over the Alps Ascertained</span> (1794). Despite his aversion to the limitations of local history and his low opinion of antiquarian studies in general, in 1804 he issued <span class="italic">The Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall</span>. While purporting to be a study of the church of St Germans, it was, more controversially, a polemic on the history of early Christianity and druidism (with many a criticism hurled at Cornwall's previous historian, William Borlase) and the history of Gothic architecture. Whitaker's views on early British society were idiosyncratic: in both this and the <span class="italic">History of Manchester</span>, he argued that the ancient Britons had already established a feudal system, and under the Romans had been entirely converted to Christianity. The <span class="italic">Life of St Neots</span>, published posthumously in 1809, was similarly intended to challenge traditional orthodoxies in the form of the extant saint's lives. He also published a number of sermons, poems, and articles for Richard Polwhele's <span class="italic">History of Cornwall</span>. He was a prolific reviewer for the <span class="italic">English Review</span>, <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, and <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>, finding this an important means of supplementing his income and paying for the books necessary for his studies. In addition to his published works he had planned or contemplated a number of other projects: a parochial history of Cornwall, a military history of the Romans in Britain, a history of Oxford, one of London, notes on Shakespeare, and illustrations to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was a man of fiery temperament and extreme views, and a fervent belief in all the tenets of &#145;orthodox&#146; Christianity. He was able to inspire considerable friendship and loyalty from those who knew him best. His close friend Richard Polwhele described him as being of a tall, muscular frame, dark featured, and with light greenish eyes. He reputedly had a squint and wore false teeth made of ebony. He died at his rectory on 30 October 1808 and was buried in the parish; his widow, who had long suffered ill health, lived on until 30 December 1828.<br>
