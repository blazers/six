<span class="headword">Cow,  Peter Brusey</span>  (1815&#150;1890), <span class="occ">rubber manufacturer</span>, was born at Deptford on 25 September 1815, the younger son of John Cow, a master boat builder at Woolwich Dockyard. In 1830, at the age of fifteen, he was apprenticed to Charles Gower Collins, a linen draper of Lower Sloane Street, Chelsea. After completing his apprenticeship in 1835 he stayed with Collins until 1837, when he worked for Gainsford and Goods for a year. In 1838 he went to Swan and Edgar at Waterloo House, where he lived in, but was meantime in touch with Samuel Matthews, superintendent of the three London branches of Charles Macintosh &amp; Co., rubber manufacturers, at 46 Cheapside, 66 Broad Street, and 58 Charing Cross. The firm's main activity was the manufacture of waterproof garments made of double-texture cloth. In 1842 Cow opened his own shop in Bishopsgate, selling lace and baby linen.<br>
<br>Cow was made a member of the Loriners' Company in 1843, and on 11 November that year married Sarah Hatfull, a doctor's daughter from Deptford. Matthews had meanwhile bought the Charing Cross branch of Macintosh &amp; Co. and in 1846 offered Cow a joint share in the Cheapside business with his son George, which he accepted. The Cows lived at the Cheapside premises and their first son, Peter Brusey (II), was born there in 1847. A second son, Douglas, followed in 1849, and there were also three daughters of the marriage: Sarah Elizabeth, later wife of Edward Spencer Alexander, Mary Billing, who married Richard Osmond Hearson, and Kate.<br>
<br>In 1850 Matthews took George out of the business and sold his share to Cow for &pound;4000. The firm was now styled P. B. Cow, Rubber Manufacturer. In 1851 a factory was opened at Deptford Creek, and the Cows moved there. That same year, when it was the first to introduce waterproof tweed commercially, the firm won an award at the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace.<br>
<br>In 1852, with William G. Forster, Cow founded the Lonestone Chemical Works at Streatham, and in 1857 moved the manufacturing activity from the Deptford factory, which had become too small, to a former cr&ecirc;pe factory at Streatham. The firm still traded as P. B. Cow, and retained this name in 1861 when Cow took a partner, John Hill, to help at the Cheapside premises. The renamed firm of Cow and Forster resulted when Cow took Thomas Forster as partner in 1863, but when the partnership was renewed in 1868 the old name was reintroduced, in the style P. B. Cow, Hill &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Cow's elder son had now joined the Streatham side of the business and became partner there in 1871. In 1874 Cow senior purchased the Cheapside property and soon after acquired the adjacent premises at no. 47 for the expanding business. In 1874 Cow's grandson, Peter Brusey (III), was born, and that same year his second son, Douglas, became a partner, sharing the management of the Cheapside business with Hill. In 1881 the Cheapside premises were destroyed by fire, and a new building was erected on the site. When Hill retired in 1887, to be succeeded by James Crump, the firm's cashier, the firm once again became P. B. Cow &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Cow senior retired in 1888, by which time his already indifferent health was fast deteriorating. A winter stay in Hastings from November 1889 had no beneficial effect, and he returned gravely ill to Streatham, where he died of heart failure at his home, 15 Streatham Common on 27 March 1890. Cow was actively involved in church work throughout his life, and was on the building committee of St James's, Hatcham. While at Streatham he was churchwarden of Emmanuel Church, Streatham Common, and he donated generously to the building of St Andrew's Church, Lower Streatham.<br>
