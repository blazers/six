<span class="headword">Sturge,  Eliza Mary</span>  (1842&#150;1905), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born on 14 November 1842 in Frederick Street, Edgbaston, the daughter of Charles Sturge (1800&#150;1888), corn factor and sometime mayor of Birmingham, and his wife, Mary Darby, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dickinson. As such, she was a member of the dynasty of midlands Quaker philanthropists: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26746/', "Joseph Sturge")</script> was her uncle, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56584/', "Sophia Sturge (1795&#150;1845)")</script>, the Birmingham anti-slavery activist, her aunt.<br>
<br>Brought up in a reforming atmosphere, Eliza Sturge dedicated her life to liberal causes, in particular &#145;asserting the right of women to work, side by side with men, for the public good&#146;  (<span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>, 122). In 1869 she took up the cause of women's suffrage with fervour, becoming secretary and then vice-president of the Birmingham branch of the Women's Suffrage Association. She became an active suffrage lecturer, on one occasion moving the resolution in favour of women's suffrage in opposition to her family friend John Bright. One of her speeches, given at a meeting in Birmingham town hall on 6 December 1872, was published (as <span class="italic">On Women's Suffrage</span>). The speech ranged over the inability of politicians to suggest practical methods of making a living for women reduced to poverty, the failure of the Liberal Associations to take up the cause of women's suffrage, the undervaluing of women's work and activities, and the demeaning practices of chivalry (&#145;I set a low value upon the surface forms of politeness which we are supposed to receive in lieu of a vote&#146;). Sturge highlighted the fact that class, not gender, frequently dictated the treatment meted out to women, and that women were blamed for being the product of a social and educational system designed to restrict their intellectual and spiritual development (&#145;if [men] will not allow room for the virtues of independence, they must be content with the vices of dependence&#146;). Her rousing conclusion asserted &#145;You may say we have liberty of conscience; liberty of conscience without liberty of action is a mockery&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1873 Eliza Sturge was adopted by the Birmingham Liberal caucus as a candidate for the school board elections; she came third, behind Joseph Chamberlain and George Dixon, and served on the board until 1876. The first woman elected to the Birmingham school board, her work has been assessed as &#145;highly competent&#146;  (Hollis, 140), but she was &#145;rendered virtually voiceless and invisible&#146; at meetings of the board which were dominated by her male Liberal colleagues. She stepped down in 1876 to pursue her interests in the suffrage movement and in temperance reform. She retained an interest in education, however, and from 1902 served on the Worcestershire education committee. In later years she lived at 28 Bank Hill, Bewdley. Eliza Sturge died from cancer of the breast and lungs on 24 November 1905 at 45 Hagley Road, Edgbaston, the home of her niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56586/', "Dr Mary Darby Sturge")</script>, who certified her death and was the sole beneficiary of her will.<br>
