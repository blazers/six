<span class="headword">Plough,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1562), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Christopher Plough of Nottingham. Educated at Oxford, he had presumably graduated by 1538, since on 17 May that year he received dispensation to take all holy orders outside statutory times and two on the same day. He succeeded his uncle John Plough as rector of St Peter's, Nottingham, on 13 February 1539, resigning by June 1550. He supplicated at Oxford for the degree of bachelor of civil law early in 1544 and the same year was instituted to the tiny living of Sarratt in the liberty of St Albans, on the Buckinghamshire&#150;Hertfordshire border, compounding for his first fruits on 3 May. On 7 October 1552 he compounded for the rectory of Bocarde in the marches of Calais, bringing as his two sureties Thomas Plough, barber, and John Hardye, tailor, both of St Albans.<br>
<br>Still listed as vicar of Sarratt in November 1554, when Edmund Bonner, restored as bishop of London at the beginning of Mary's reign, visited the diocese, Plough was conspicuous by his absence. He had probably either retired to Calais or else already departed for Basel, where he is supposed to have engaged in controversy with his fellow protestants William Kethe and Robert Crowley, and certainly did so with the Catholic Miles Huggarde. <span class="italic">An Apology for Protestants</span> (1558 or 1559) was written in reply to Huggarde's <span class="italic">The Displaying of the Protestantes</span> (1556) but no copy is known to survive. Two other tracts ascribed to Plough, <span class="italic">A Treatise Against the Mitred Men in the Popish Kingdom</span> and <span class="italic">The Sound of the Doleful Trumpet</span>, are likewise lost. The only official record of Plough's presence abroad, beyond his listing in John Bale's catalogue of exiles, comes from the account book of the rector of Basel, which after Mary's death records a payment of 2<i>s</i>. from &#145;Joannis Blougk Angli&#146; for letters testimonial, effectively a passport for his return to England.<br>
<br>Plough was granted letters patent, enrolled on 28 December 1559, by Sir Nicholas Bacon, the lord keeper, for the crown living of Long Bredy, Dorset, on the recommendation of &#145;Mr Buggins&#146;. This was presumably the exile John Buggins, &#145;merchant companion&#146; of John Bodley in Geneva. Plough held the living until his death. He was also one of the first of the exiles to be preferred by Edmund Grindal after his consecration as bishop of London. On 18 February 1560 Grindal collated him to the vicarage of East Ham, Essex, close to the city. According to the antiquary William Cole, Plough, George Hody, and John Opynshaw presented Elizabeth with a treatise on protestant doctrine.<br>
<br>Plough probably lived in East Ham rather than Dorset. In January 1561 he was bequeathed 20 shillings by one of his Essex parishioners, and was present as vicar at Grindal's primary visitation of London diocese in April 1561. His successor was collated on 18 November 1562, when the living was void by his death. No will is known and there is no evidence that he married. That he had not done so before departing for Basel is effectively confirmed by the fact that he was not deprived in early 1554, as were the vast majority of London's married clergy.<br>
