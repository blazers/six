<span class="headword">Blachford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tighe]</span>,  Theodosia</span>  (<em>c.</em>1745&#150;<em>c.</em>1817), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was the only daughter of four children born to William Tighe MP and his first wife, Lady Mary Bligh, granddaughter of the first earl of Darnley, of Rosanna, co. Wicklow, Ireland. Her mother died while she was young, and Theodosia spent her youth looking after her father, who suffered from gout. It was through reading to him from his library that she educated herself. In 1770 Theodosia married William Blachford (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1773), a landowner, clergyman of the Church of Ireland, and the librarian of St Patrick's Library in Dublin. She was widowed in 1773, the mother of two children, a boy and a girl. She believed that the education of children was the primary duty of women, and educated her children at home before sending her son to Eton College when he was twelve years old. Her daughter, the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27443/', "Mary Tighe (1772&#150;1810)")</script>, was the author of <span class="italic">Psyche</span> (1805).<br>
<br>About 1761, when Theodosia was almost seventeen, she experienced what she regarded as a spiritual awakening from which she resolved to &#145;renounce the world, leave all&#146;  (Wicklow MS 4810). About 1775 she became interested in Methodism and corresponded with Agnes Smith. John Wesley was to note in correspondence to the Revd Henry Moore in June 1788 that, &#145;Mrs. Blachford is one of our jewels, I love her much&#146;  (Crookshank, 142). Blachford educated poor girls and penned a number of tracts. She translated the <span class="italic">Life</span> of Jeanne de Chantal, founder of the Visitation order, into English. She was influenced by the author and religious mystic William Law, who about 1740 had established a small community in Northamptonshire which was dedicated to pious reflection and to charitable works. For Theodosia philanthropy and faith were inextricably linked. She was associated with a number of charities in Dublin, and was instrumental in establishing the Female Orphan House in 1790 and founding the House of Refuge in Baggot Street, Dublin, in 1802. Theodosia died about 1817, and her burial place remains unrecorded.<br>
