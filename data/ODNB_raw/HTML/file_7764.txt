<span class="headword">Dodwell,  Henry</span>  (1706&#150;1784), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and barrister</span>, was born on 25 November 1706 at Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, the fourth child and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7763/', "Henry Dodwell (1641&#150;1711)")</script>, classical scholar and theologian, and Anne Elliot (<i>d</i>. 1750). Educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 17 April 1723, he proceeded BA on 9 February 1726 and went on to study law. He entered the Middle Temple on 15 January 1731, from where he was called to the bar on 10 February 1738. He later became a bencher (1767) of the Middle Temple and served as reader from Lent 1775 and as treasurer from 1778.<br>
<br>Dodwell was an early participant in the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. However, he is remembered largely because of his satirical assault on the fideism of William Law and other orthodox apologists in a book entitled <span class="italic">Christianity not Founded on Argument</span> (1741). Though it was published anonymously Dodwell was widely known to be the book's author. The supposed thesis of the work is that reason cannot be the foundation of vital Christian faith; Dodwell argued that the notion &#145;that your Assent to Revealed Truths should be founded upon the Conviction of your Understanding&#146; was &#145;false and unwarranted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christianity not Founded on Argument</span>, 7). Rather, belief in Christ must be maintained in opposition to the dictates of fallen reason. Moreover he questioned:<blockquote>whether that Person does not enjoy his Belief with much greater Tranquility and Confidence of Spirit, who never asked himself but one Single Question about it, than he, who by the most elaborate Discussions, and busiest Search, has attained to the utmost Degree of Moral Assurance in the Matter. (ibid., 29)</blockquote>This reasoning parodies the argument contained in William Law's lucid <span class="italic">The Case of Reason</span> (1731), in which the talented and pious Law argues against the general aggrandizement of reason in all areas of human existence.<br>
<br>Though written by a deist and in opposition to Christian apologists <span class="italic">Christianity not Founded on Argument</span> was read by many as a serious and even important defence of the faith. The long battle with deism had taken its toll on public confidence in argument, and less discerning readers found in Dodwell a sensible retreat to a faith not dependent on an individual's capacity as a logician. Methodists in particular were drawn to Dodwell's argument and some recommended it to John Wesley himself. Dodwell's thesis complemented the Wesleyan doctrines of new birth and instantaneous conversion. Dodwell had written:<blockquote>the Holy Ghost irradiates the souls of believers at once with an irresistible light from heaven that flashes conviction in a moment, so that this faith is completed in an instant, and the most perfect and finished creed produced at once without any tedious progress in deductions of our own.</blockquote>Wesley, however, was not taken in by Dodwell's satire:<blockquote>On a careful perusal of that piece, notwithstanding my prejudice in its favour, I could not but perceive that the great design uniformly pursued throughout the work was to render the whole of the Christian institution both odious and contemptible. His point throughout is to prove that Christianity is contrary to reason, or that no man acting according to the principles of reason can possibly be a Christian. (J. Wesley, <span class="italic">Earnest Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion</span>, 1743, 14)</blockquote>Wesley adds the cautionary note that Dodwell's book &#145;is a wonderful proof of the power that smooth words may have even on serious minds that so many have mistook such a writer as this for a friend of Christianity&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Dodwell's most ardent respondent, Philip Doddridge, published three letters in reply to <span class="italic">Christianity not Founded on Argument</span> in 1742&#150;3. Doddridge asked indignantly, in response to Dodwell's charge that faith made no reference to reason:<blockquote>Can anyone indeed seriously think, that the noblest of our powers was intended only to the lowest and meanest purposes; to serve the little offices of moral life, and not to be consulted in the greatest concerns; those of immortality? Strange! (P. Doddridge, <span class="italic">The Perspicuity and Solidity of the Evidences for Christianity</span>, 1742, 10)</blockquote>The most authoritative of the anti-deistic writers, John Leland, wrote an entire work on Dodwell's subject, entitled <span class="italic">Remarks on a Late Pamphlet, Entitled, &#145;Christianity not Founded on Argument&#146;</span> (1744), and devoted a chapter to it in his <span class="italic">View of the Principal Deistical Writers</span> (1757). Dodwell was also answered by George Benson in <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of the Christian Religion as Delivered in the Scriptures</span> (1743) and by Thomas Randolph in <span class="italic">The Christian Faith a Rational Assent</span> (1744). Dodwell's own brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7765/', "William Dodwell")</script> preached two sermons against the book before the University of Oxford. These repudiations notwithstanding, even William Law, apparently one of the objects of Dodwell's satire, maintained the possibility that <span class="italic">Christianity not Founded on Argument</span> had been written by an earnest Christian. Dodwell died in 1784.<br>
