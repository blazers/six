<span class="headword">Wardlaw,  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1320&#150;1387), <span class="occ">bishop of Glasgow and cardinal</span>, was possibly the son of Henry Wardlaw, who possessed half of the barony of Wilton, Roxburghshire; his mother, according to later tradition, was the daughter of Sir James Stewart of Durrisdeer, a cousin of King Robert II. He was also related to Gilbert Wardlaw, an Edinburgh burgess. From the later 1330s until the mid-1350s Wardlaw attended Paris University. He obtained several degrees including a doctorate of theology by 1358. In addition to his studies and teaching responsibilities, Wardlaw served periodically as regent in arts and as proctor of the English nation, and in 1345 as university rector. He has been credited with authorship of works which no longer survive, including a history of his family and others entitled <span class="italic">De fallacia astrologorum</span> and <span class="italic">De inani divinationum vititarum scientia</span>.<br>
<br>Academic prestige did little to augment Wardlaw's financial resources. Among the poorest class of student in 1341, his ecclesiastical advancement was initially limited. He held a canonry of Glasgow by 1344 and, together with this, successively the parishes of Dunino, Fife, by 1349 and Errol, Perthshire, by 1351. It was not until after the conclusion of his university career that more lucrative benefices followed. By 1359 he had been appointed archdeacon of Lothian (the southern part of the diocese of St Andrews), and in 1366 he won Edward III's approval to exercise his office in the English-controlled parts of the archdeaconry. He also obtained canonries in Aberdeen, Moray, and Ross. In part this advancement reflected the patronage of William Landel, bishop of St Andrews, whose family were Roxburghshire neighbours of the Wardlaws of Wilton. Wardlaw presided at Landel's funeral at St Andrews in 1385, which was delayed until his arrival. It was perhaps also Landel's influence which led to Wardlaw's appointment as royal secretary. He held this position from at least May 1363 and probably until 1367. From 1359, but especially when secretary, he regularly witnessed royal charters and served on embassies to England, often with Landel. It was probably with David II's support that Wardlaw was elected bishop of Glasgow, his consecration taking place at Avignon in 1367, probably in April.<br>
<br>Wardlaw's domestic political prominence declined following Robert II's accession in 1371. He assisted in the negotiation of the Franco-Scottish alliance of 1371 but spent the ensuing five years at the papal court, returning to Avignon periodically afterwards, notably in the immediate aftermath of the schism of 1378. It is possible that having been a leading agent of David II, he deliberately chose to distance himself thus from the new king, with whom his relations may have been uneasy. So rarely was he seen in Scotland that rumours of his death in 1374 prompted the seizure of his moveable goods. On 23 December 1383, while Wardlaw was briefly home, Pope Clement VII appointed him a cardinal, the first ever from Scotland. He continued to act as bishop of Glasgow <i>in commendam</i>, but also resumed his diplomatic career, visiting Berwick in 1380 to conclude an Anglo-Scottish truce; Vincennes in 1383 to conclude another Franco-Scottish alliance; and Leulinghen in 1384 to represent Scottish interests at the international conference there. The exact date and place of Wardlaw's death are unknown. He witnessed a charter at Edinburgh on 22 May 1387 and was dead by 20 September following. Sixteenth-century sources place his death on 21 or 23 August.<br>
