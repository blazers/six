<span class="headword">Common,  John William <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1903&#150;1968), <span class="occ">novelist and essayist</span>, was born on 15 August 1903 at 44 Third Avenue, Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne, the only son and second of the four children of John Common, engine driver, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson. He had two younger sisters, Lilian and Jessie; his elder sister died young. After attending Chillingham Road School, Heaton, where he showed a talent for writing and developed a lifelong love of Shelley, he went on in 1917 to Skerry's Commercial College, Newcastle. This, however, led only to an unsatisfying job in a solicitor's office, followed by intermittent casual employment. By 1924 he was a vigorous debater at the Newcastle Socialist Society in the Royal Arcade, then the location of the pioneering People's Theatre, with its stimulating performances of Shaw, O'Casey, and Pirandello. Plans for a degree course at Durham University came to nothing, but Common was by now submitting articles (typed on his old Monarch) to the literary magazines. John Middleton Murry at <span class="italic">The Adelphi</span> gave him encouragement, and in 1928 (against his father's wishes) Common made his way to London to earn a precarious living by freelancing in left-wing literary circles. He rose to be editor of <span class="italic">The Adelphi</span> in 1935&#150;6.<br>
<br>Common's writing was warm, ironic, and intensely political in a non-abstract way, while being occasionally garrulous and couched in a quirky style which strove to combine proletarian directness with intellectual rumination. Without employing dialect, he conveyed something of the cadences of his local speech. He won admirers throughout the 1930s as a writer with a genuine proletarian viewpoint, as distinct from the purveyors of middle-class Marxist fiction. He inspired, prefaced, and edited the compilation <span class="italic">Seven Shifts</span> (1938), in which seven working men told of their experience. In the same year he published a collection of his own essays, <span class="italic">The Freedom of the Streets</span>, which was a continual spur to thought with its wry humanity and subtle analysis of working-class attitudes. Common showed why a propensity for speculative thinking might be a profitable asset to a middle-class child, but led to endless friction at a lower level of society; or why a bright proletarian youth might wilfully fondle his inhibitions, loath to sully his innocence by joining the responsible decision-making class. V. S. Pritchett considered <span class="italic">The Freedom of the Streets</span> to be the most influential book in his life, and George Orwell heard<blockquote>the authentic voice of the ordinary man, the man who might infuse a new decency into the control of affairs if only he could get there, but who in practice never seems to get much further than the trenches, the sweatshop and the jail. (<span class="italic">New English Weekly</span>, 16 June 1938)</blockquote>For his part, the clear-eyed Common saw Orwell, whom he had first met at the <span class="italic">Adelphi</span> offices, as something of a sheep in wolf's clothing (in pubs the barmen always called Orwell &#145;sir&#146;). The two remained friends, however, corresponding and occasionally meeting when Common was running the village shop in Datchworth, Hertfordshire, about 10 miles from Orwell's Wallington cottage. The impractical Orwell asked Common's advice on setting up his own shop. At this time Common and his partner, Mary Anderson (1901&#150;1942), a childhood friend from Newcastle who went south to join him, had a son, Peter; another son, Robert, was born later. Though they never married, touching love letters survive from their courtship. Common was poor enough by now to be subsidized by Orwell on occasion, and when the latter was in Morocco in 1938 Common and Mary Anderson looked after the Wallington cottage.<br>
<br>At some time during the Second World War Common moved to Frating Community Farm in Essex, where pacifists contributed to the war effort by farming. Mary died in 1942 from cancer, and Common began living with Constance Helena (Connie) McConnell-Wood, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sambidge (1902&#150;1979), another Newcastle friend of his youth. Their daughter Caroline Alison (Sally) was born in 1944 (she was sixteen when her parents eventually married, in 1961). Twin daughters, Mary and Charmian, were born in 1946. Meanwhile Common took part in a number of wartime radio broadcasts, including a lively debate, <span class="italic">What Matters?</span>, broadcast on 19 June 1942, which featured two opposing sets of speakers representing, roughly, suburbia and &#145;the streets&#146;. Common remarked: &#145;I like a good argument&#146;  (BBC written archive). After the war he was engaged in writing film scripts including <span class="italic">Good Neighbours</span> (1946), about a community scheme in a Scottish town; he also travelled to Newfoundland on another film assignment. The family changed residence several times, ending up in a council house at 32 Warren Hamlet, Storrington, Sussex, with Common trying to make ends meet by working at a mushroom nursery, while toiling over scripts and reviews at night, and writing for himself in between. He was acutely oppressed by financial insecurity&#151;and the lack of beer and tobacco.<br>
<br>In 1951 Turnstile Press published Common's best-known book, the autobiographical <span class="italic">Kiddar's Luck</span>, in which he vividly described his childhood on the streets of Edwardian Tyneside, as seen through the lens of his adult socialism. There were four chapters on his life before five years of age&#151;a feat of detailed memory&#151;while his mother's alcoholism and the overbearing father whom he at length dramatically defied formed the dark background to the vigorous, at times bravura, narrative. The book found praise as a slice of Geordie naturalism, a convincing depiction of &#145;the other England&#146;, which so beguiled the imagination of contemporary intellectuals. On the other hand, its irony and subtly bitter universality went largely unrecognized. In <span class="italic">The Ampersand</span> (1954) Common took the story further, but his publishers went into liquidation two years later. Neither book was a commercial success, and Common did not complete the trilogy with his long-promised &#145;Riches and Rare&#146;, a novel set in Newcastle at the time of the general strike.<br>
<br>In 1956 Common embarked upon a two-year stint as guide to Chastleton House in the Cotswolds, a position obtained for him through Sir Richard Rees, a friend from <span class="italic">Adelphi</span> days. Predictable disagreements with the owner, Alan Clutton-Brock, put an end to an arrangement whereby Common had been able to get some writing done in the winter months. In 1958 a friend from Frating days, Irene Palmer, was instrumental in obtaining a rented Georgian house at 14 St John Street, in the centre of Newport Pagnell. There Common spent hours working on books for film treatment reviews in the &#145;garden&#146; (a cemetery), walking with Connie in the countryside they both loved, and reading to his children. His daughter Sally later recalled listening to Shelley and &#145;Umar Khayyam in the Fitzgerald translation, whose atheistic stance Common was at pains to emphasize. He had always been interested in astronomy (his Uncle Robin was a flat-earther), and Fred Hoyle's theory of an endlessly self-renewing universe, which dispensed with a creator, was attractive.<br>
<br>Though not a tactile person, Common was not a stern parent and never struck his children. He had small, feminine hands, badly stained with nicotine, and, Geordie-fashion, left domestic work to his wife. He was not a joiner or an activist, nor did he encourage his children to be so. He did, however, blossom in the right setting, often in pubs (his favourite was The Bull in Newport Pagnell), where he enjoyed political arguments with self-taught thinkers like himself. Another favourite haunt was the nearby working men's club on Silver Street, where he took his slippered ease at the bar. He was a connoisseur of beer and was described by his friend Tommy McCulloch as &#145;fairly jolly&#146; at this period, though he retained his hatred of the &#145;bulky bourgeoisie&#146;&#151;and kept his Newcastle accent  (private information). Laurence Bradshaw used Common's brow as a model for his bust of Karl Marx in Highgate cemetery, saying that he found there a similar patience and understanding.<br>
<br>Too old to be an angry young man of the 1950s, Common could not sustain a career in writing. His political attitudes were by now out of fashion, and when he sent the manuscript of <span class="italic">In Whitest Britain</span> (1961) to his friend Eric Warman, Warman replied in a letter of 7 June 1961 that he was sorry such a &#145;bloody good writer&#146; could not achieve success. Nevertheless there was too much &#145;class distinction&#146; in the book, and the downtrodden, golden-hearted workman was a dated &#145;leading clich&eacute;&#146;  (Jack Common MSS). Thus Common, perhaps the finest chronicler of the English working class to follow Robert Tressell, spent his last years in Newport Pagnell writing film treatments at poor rates. He died there of lung cancer on 20 January 1968 and was cremated at Bedford on 24 January. He was survived by his wife and children, and left a mass of unpublished material, now held in the Robinson Library of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
