<span class="headword">Peyton, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Thomas Peyton of Bury St Edmunds, customer of Plymouth, and his wife, Cecilia, daughter of John Bourchier, second earl of Bath. He attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1594. He probably went straight from there to serve in the army of the Dutch republic, though the date and circumstances of his first service in the Netherlands is uncertain. He was given command of a company of foot in 1605, an office which he kept until at least 1614.<br>
<br>Peyton was knighted by James I in 1606 and joined the household of his namesake, Henry, prince of Wales, the same year. Peyton married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1619/20), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset")</script>, and widow of Andrew Rogers of Bryanstone, Dorset, at Long Ditton, Surrey, on 22 September 1607. She must have been more than twenty years older than her new husband. Peyton wrote in his will (which he made in April 1618) of the &#145;singular love which I beare unto &hellip; my wife&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/143, fol. 142).<br>
<br>In 1610 Peyton was given charge of a &#145;kind lettre&#146; from Prince Henry's secretary to Sir Horace Vere, the pre-eminent English commander in Dutch service  (Trim, 347); this marked the beginning of an attempt by the prince to establish a circle of military men. In 1613 Peyton and another English soldier, Sir William Constable, were rivals for a subordinate office in the &#145;cautionary town&#146; of Brill: such posts were prized because they were a foothold in the English establishment, though it did not necessitate surrendering existing commissions in the Dutch army. The following year Peyton served as a captain in Vere's regiment in the Cleves&#150;J&uuml;lich campaign.<br>
<br>Early in 1618 Peyton expanded his horizon when he went to the Adriatic in command of a force of 500 infantry hired by the Venetian republic as part of an Anglo-Dutch force raised to counter the threat posed by the aggression of the Spanish viceroy of Naples. Peyton was, the Venetian ambassador-extraordinary assured his masters, &#145;an English gentleman, one of the good soldiers of Flanders, where he yet has a company in the service of the States&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1617&#150;19</i>, 123). Conceding that Peyton had no experience of naval affairs, the ambassador was convinced that his courage on land would make him worthy of the republic's favour. Peyton was made a colonel to give him the same rank as the senior Dutch officer. Having reached the Adriatic in July 1618 after a hard voyage, Peyton was unable to prevent his troops mutinying over pay. Any breach caused by the ruthless action of the Venetian admiral in hanging the ringleaders was later papered over by the Venetian authorities paying Peyton the money due to him and giving him a gold chain in token of their respect. Peyton's force formed only a small part of the foreign troops aboard the Venetian fleet&#151;a mere 350 men by the summer of 1619 after the depletions of long months at sea, compared with over 3000 Dutchmen&#151;but his three companies were praised by the new captain-general at sea as brave troops under a brave and prudent leader. Peyton had command of his own ship.<br>
<br>In December 1619 Peyton's force went into winter quarters at Zara in Dalmatia; from the following summer they were stationed partly in Venice's mainland territories, partly at sea. Peyton himself seems never to have returned to England, despite his or the English ambassador's suggesting on three occasions&#151;in August 1620, February 1621, and January 1622&#151;that he go back to recruit more men. In March 1621 the Venetian ambassador to England reported to the doge and senate stories that returning officers and soldiers were complaining of the ill treatment that they had received at Peyton's hands. By early 1622 Peyton, when he was stationed at Brescia, was reported as heavily in debt. In July of that year Peyton offered to serve with Venice's allies, the Grisons&#151;the protestant &#145;grey leagues&#146; whose lands which controlled the alpine passes into Italy had recently been partly occupied by Habsburg forces&#151;either openly as an officer of the republic or covertly in a deniable role. The suggestion was turned down.<br>
<br>Peyton's wife, Mary, died in his absence and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 18 January 1620. Later, in Venice, Peyton married a daughter of Vicenzo Gritti, who survived him. He died of a fever on 13 October 1623.<br>
