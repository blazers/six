<span class="headword">Smith,  George Joseph</span>  (1872&#150;1915), <span class="occ">bigamist and murderer</span>, was born on 11 January 1872 at 92 Roman Road, Bethnal Green, London, the son of George Thomas Smith, insurance agent, and his wife, Louisa Gibson. Little is known about his early life. Caroline Thornhill, his first known spouse, maintained that he was sent to a reformatory in Gravesend when he was nine and that when he left, at the age of sixteen, he returned home to live with his mother and began a career of petty theft. Certainly, on 7 February 1891 he was convicted at Lambeth police court of the theft of a bicycle and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Smith's activities between 1891 and 1896 are uncertain. An alleged three-year service with the Northamptonshire regiment during this period has never been substantiated.<br>
<br>As far as is known, Smith's first and only legal wife was Caroline Beatrice (<i>b</i>. 1879), daughter of Edward Thornhill, bootmaker, of Leicester. The two were married there on 17 January 1898, with Smith using the name George Oliver Love. Smith soon led his bride into crime. By providing her with false references he secured positions for her in domestic service in London and on the south coast and then induced her to steal valuables from the households in which she worked. On 9 January 1901, however, he was convicted at Hastings of receiving goods stolen by his wife and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Thereafter Smith became a professional bigamist. His technique was to ensnare lonely and vulnerable women with promises of matrimony and then to desert them, before or after marriage, as soon as he had gained possession of their money. Between the Thornhill marriage and his last arrest in 1915 he married at least seven women. With only one did he maintain a lasting relationship. The exception was Edith Mabel (<i>b</i>. 1878), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pegler, whom Smith married, under his real name, on 30 July 1908 at Bristol. He returned to her between his other marriages, accounting for his long absences by pretending to be an antiques dealer whose business necessitated extended trips around the country and abroad.<br>
<br>Smith murdered three brides. Using the name Henry Williams, he married the first of these, Bessie Constance Annie Mundy (<i>b</i>. 1875), at Weymouth on 26 August 1910. Bessie had inherited a fortune of about &pound;2500 upon the death of her father, George Barclay Mundy, a bank manager at Warminster, but the money was invested in gilt-edged securities and managed for her by a family trust. In May 1912 the couple rented a house at 80 High Street, Herne Bay, in Kent. Smith took legal advice as to how he might secure possession of his wife's legacy and on 8 July he and Bessie executed wills in favour of one another. Two days later Smith brought Bessie to the surgery of Dr F. A. French, a local physician, and told him that she had had a fit. French prescribed bromide of potassium as a sedative. When the doctor last saw Bessie alive, on the afternoon of 12 July 1912, he thought she looked &#145;in perfect health&#146;. But the next morning he was summoned to Smith's house and found her dead in the bath. An inquest was held before Rutley Mowll, coroner for east Kent, on 15 July. Concluding that &#145;Mrs Williams&#146; had drowned in the bath after suffering an epileptic fit, the jury returned a verdict of death by misadventure. Smith obtained probate of his wife's will in September and the securities held in trust for her were paid into his hands.<br>
<br>Neither of the subsequent murder victims had substantial financial resources, so Smith persuaded them to take out life insurance. This apart, his procedure was almost identical to that in the Mundy case. The brides were whisked off to places where they were unknown, their uncertain health was established by visits to local doctors, and then they were drowned in their baths. Under his real name he married Alice Burnham (<i>b</i>. 1888), daughter of Charles Burnham, a fruit grower of Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, on 4 November 1913 at Portsmouth. After she had insured her life for &pound;500 and made a will in Smith's favour, he took her to Blackpool where, on 12 December 1913, he drowned her in the bath at their lodgings at 16 Regent Road. Smith persuaded his last victim, a clergyman's daughter named Margaret Elizabeth Lofty (<i>b</i>. 1876), to insure her life for &pound;700. He married her, under the name John Lloyd, on 17 December 1914 at Bath, and murdered her the very next day, at 14 Bismarck Road, Highgate. Inquest juries returned verdicts of accidental death in both cases. Smith realized &pound;506 from the insurance paid under Alice Burnham's will but was not given the opportunity to benefit from that of Margaret Lofty.<br>
<br>Smith's arrest resulted from a report of the Lofty inquest that appeared in the national press. It was seen by Charles Burnham, Alice's father, and by Joseph Crossley, the son-in-law of her Blackpool landlady, and although the names were different both noted the striking similarity between the two cases and communicated their suspicions to the police. On 22 June 1915 Smith was eventually brought to trial at the central criminal court for the murder of Bessie Mundy and, notwithstanding a spirited defence by Edward Marshall Hall, was convicted and sentenced to death. He was hanged at Maidstone Prison on 13 August 1915 and buried there.<br>
<br>Smith stood 5 feet 9 inches in height and moved in what was described as a &#145;military walk&#146;. He had brown hair and a fair complexion and sometimes sported a ginger moustache. Cruel and unscrupulous, he nevertheless attracted a succession of na&iuml;ve and impressionable women. One of his bigamously married brides spoke of the hypnotic power of his eyes. Much is explained, however, by his genteel appearance, his pretensions to independent means, and his capacity for unctuous flattery.<br>
