</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baillie,  Matthew</span>  (1761&#150;1823), <span class="occ">morbid anatomist and physician</span>, was born on 27 October 1761 at Shotts manse, Lanarkshire, the second but only surviving son of James Baillie (<i>c</i>.1722&#150;1778) and his wife, Dorothea (<i>c</i>.1721&#150;1806). They had an elder daughter, and also one younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1062/', "Joanna Baillie")</script> the poet. James Baillie was successively minister of Shotts, Bothwell, and Hamilton; ultimately he was professor of divinity at the University of Glasgow. Dorothea Baillie's father was John Hunter of Long Calderwood, near East Kilbride, Lanarkshire; the anatomists <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14234/', "William Hunter")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14220/', "John Hunter")</script> were her brothers.<br>
<br>Baillie was educated at the English school (1766&#150;8) and the Latin school (1768&#150;74) in Hamilton and at the University of Glasgow (1774&#150;9), which nominated him to a Snell exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was also appointed to a Warner exhibition through the interest of his uncle William Hunter. He matriculated at Oxford in April 1779, and lived there full time for eighteen months reading classics and English history. Balliol was then at its nadir, but Baillie's tutor, Richard Prosser, later archdeacon of Durham, was a reformer for whom Baillie had great respect; Baillie and Prosser together were the college's elder statesmen as it rose to dominance forty years on. Late in 1780 Baillie went to live with William Hunter in London, thereafter keeping only minimal terms at Oxford, graduating BA in 1783 (MA, 1786). Hunter had established an anatomy school and museum in Great Windmill Street. Baillie attended dissections and lectures there, teaching in the dissecting room himself after one session. He also went to courses in chemistry, medicine, surgery, and obstetrics given by George Fordyce, William Hunter's estranged younger brother John, Thomas Denman, and William Osborne. When William Hunter died in 1783 he left Baillie control of the anatomy school, the eventual freehold of the premises, thirty years use of the museum, and about &pound;5000. The small Hunter family estate of Long Calderwood also passed to Baillie, but he renounced it in favour of John Hunter.<br>
<br>Baillie soon became an established anatomy lecturer, and continued in that role at Great Windmill Street, working in increasingly uneasy partnership with William Hunter's former partner William Cruikshank, until 1799. But he also completed his broader medical training as a pupil at St George's Hospital, where he was appointed physician in 1787. In mid-1788 he made a four-month tour of France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, visiting many hospitals and anatomy schools, recording critical observations on conditions in the former and techniques in the latter. He graduated BM at Oxford in 1786 (DM, 1789), and was elected FRCP (London) in 1790. William Hunter's posthumous <span class="italic">An Anatomical Description of the Human Gravid Uterus and its Contents</span> (1794) was edited for publication by Baillie. Two papers in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1788 and 1789 were followed by his election FRS in 1790 (FRSE, 1799); many medical societies gave him the professional accolade of honorary membership. He was Croonian lecturer of the Royal Society (1791), and of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1796&#150;8), for whom he was also Goulstonian lecturer (1794); he gave the Harveian oration in 1798. In 1805 he was a founder member (and second president, 1808&#150;10) of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, forerunner of the Royal Society of Medicine.<br>
<br>As trustee custodian of William Hunter's museum Baillie had free access to a collection containing many pathological specimens, and as physician to a large hospital he had frequent opportunities of examining diseased corpses. He became aware of the inadequacy of the existing literature of morbid anatomy, and, taking the view that the careful observation and description of diseased structures was an essential prerequisite for the understanding of diseases, wrote <span class="italic">The Morbid Anatomy of some of the most Important Parts of the Human Body</span> (1793). In the preface he acknowledged the stupendous work <span class="italic">De sedibus et causis morborum</span> (&#145;On the sites and causes of disease&#146;), of G. B. Morgagni (1761), which comprised large numbers of case histories and post-mortem investigations, but thought its bulk self-defeating; diseased structures were &#145;often described too generally&#146; and issues were &#145;obscured, by taking notice of smaller collateral circumstances, which had no connection with them or the diseases from whence they arose&#146;. Baillie's book was based on an organ by organ system of normal anatomy, giving terse but precise descriptions of disease-induced changes, with practically no reference to cases or speculation about causes, although it contained the first connection of cirrhosis of the liver with alcoholism. The work was limited to the thoracic and abdominal organs and the brain. Significant additions were made for the second (1797) edition, especially notes on symptoms corresponding to pathological change, including some of seminal importance for cardiology (the idea of rheumatism of the heart was introduced, for example, and hardening of the coronary arteries was linked to angina). The first text of its kind, it was very influential, appearing during the author's lifetime in five British and three American editions, two in French, four in German, and three in Italian; there were four later editions in English (1825&#150;33), and one in Russian (1826). A series of superb drawings by William Clift, with commentaries by Baillie, was engraved to illustrate the <span class="italic">Morbid Anatomy</span>, and it was published in ten parts in 1799&#150;1802. Baillie also wrote numerous journal papers in 1788&#150;1820 (on, for example, pericardial absence, paraplegia, diabetes, and emphysema), which were collected and republished by James Wardrop (1825). In his will Baillie provided for the collection and printing, but not publication, of various writings which were circulated privately as <span class="italic">Lectures and Observations on Medicine</span> (1825).<br>
<br>Baillie's appointment as physician to St George's began a gradual buildup of his practice, and during the following decade it expanded considerably. When his very successful associate David Pitcairn fell ill in 1798 Baillie acquired his patients too, and in 1799 he gave up the teaching of anatomy and his St George's appointment in order to devote all his time to private practice. By 1810 his annual fee income had risen to &pound;10,000, and he was so much in demand that he was regularly working sixteen hours a day. In the same year, following attendance on Princess Amelia, he was appointed physician-extraordinary to George III. He visited the deranged king at Windsor several hundred times during the regency, and was present at his death on 29 January 1820. As physician-in-ordinary to Princess Charlotte, the king's only legitimate grandchild, on whom hopes for the eventual succession were pinned, Baillie had overall responsibility for the management of her confinement in 1817, and was present throughout her fifty-hour labour. His brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6722/', "Sir Richard Croft, sixth baronet (1762&#150;1818)")</script>, was principal accoucheur. It was a triple obstetric disaster. The child, an apparently healthy boy, was stillborn, the mother died a few hours afterwards, and Croft shot himself while depressed about it all three months later. Baillie's famous patients were not all royalty&#151;he attended Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, and Edward Gibbon, and he examined Samuel Johnson's lungs post mortem.<br>
<br>Although London remained the base of his professional practice, in 1806 Baillie bought an estate at Duntisbourne Abbots in Gloucestershire, where he lived to an increasing extent in his later years, consulting by correspondence. In 1821 he made a melodramatic dash from there to Queen Caroline's deathbed at Hammersmith. Edward Jenner was a Gloucestershire neighbour and associate; Baillie was an early supporter of vaccination.<br>
<br>In 1791 Baillie married Sophia Denman (1771&#150;1845), younger twin daughter of the obstetrician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7494/', "Thomas Denman")</script>. They had a daughter and two sons. One of the sons died in infancy, but the other, William Hunter Baillie (1797&#150;1894), survived his father as squire of Duntisbourne Abbots for more than sixty years. Baillie was of somewhat less than average height and build, with a round slightly plump face and prominent nose. Though direct and blunt in manner, and inclined to impatience with distractions and silly patients when overworked, he was of a generous disposition, sometimes waiving his fees. His relations with his family, medical colleagues, and patients were usually cordial. He enjoyed good health until early 1823, when a wasting decline, possibly tuberculosis, which was not arrested by a stay in Tunbridge Wells, set in. Baillie died at Duntisbourne Abbots on 23 September 1823, and was buried in Duntisbourne Abbots church a week later. He was commemorated with a bust and inscription in Westminster Abbey. Most of his estate, which was sworn at under &pound;80,000, he left to his family, but his medical books and the copperplates for his <span class="italic">Morbid Anatomy</span> were left to the Royal College of Physicians of London. His anatomical specimens he had given to the college, with money for their upkeep, in 1818; they were transferred to the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1938, but were destroyed by enemy action in 1941. Shortly after his death his widow gave the Royal College of Physicians of London a gold-headed cane which had belonged in turn to John Radcliffe, Richard Mead, Anthony Askew, William Pitcairn, David Pitcairn, and Baillie. It was engraved with all their arms&#151;a symbol of fame and fortune in medicine which has become legendary. Baillie's arms&#151;which were used without authority&#151;were azure nine estoils (variously mullets), three three two and one or, impaling (for Sophia Denman) argent a chevron between three lion's heads erased gules.<br>
