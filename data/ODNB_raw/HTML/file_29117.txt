<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paris,  Matthew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1200&#150;1259), <span class="occ">historian, Benedictine monk, and polymath</span>, reveals very little about his own life and personal circumstances. This is disappointing as well as ironical, considering his compulsive concern to collect and record information relating to the events and affairs of his own time, and his acute inquisitiveness concerning times past. Even his parentage, nationality, and social origins remain uncertain.<h2>
<a name="ThemonkofStAlbans"></a>The monk of St Albans</h2>His surname, which Matthew Paris usually wrote as Parisiensis, occasionally as de Parisius, might suggest French origins, but Parisiensis was by no means an uncommon patronymic in thirteenth-century England, and there is nothing in his many works, or elsewhere, to indicate that he was anything other than English, especially in view of his characteristically Anglocentric attitude towards the events of his day. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that he studied in the schools of Paris early on in his career. If so, this might account for his surname, his knowledge of French sources for many of his chronicle illustrations, his keen interest in the affairs of the University of Paris and of French affairs generally, and the number of French correspondents and contacts revealed in his works. But Paris himself says only that he became a monk of St Albans, Hertfordshire, on St Agnes's day (21 January) 1217, which suggests that he was born <i>c</i>.1200. The house remained the focus of his life and activities until his death, almost certainly in late May or June 1259. He describes very little about that life, but plainly he was soon attached to the scriptorium, where he worked in some undefined capacity with the first great historian of the abbey, Roger of Wendover, many of whose attitudes profoundly informed those of Paris himself. Upon his mentor's death in 1236 Paris took up the mantle, be it as official historiographer of the house or not, but necessarily with the abbot's licence, and devoted himself largely to his various writings until his own death.<br>
<br>Despite his seclusion, Matthew Paris was by no means isolated from the world. He had access to papal bulls, imperial <i>acta</i>, royal writs and charters, news reports and correspondence from a wide range of sources, English and continental, secular and ecclesiastical; his closest informants, many of whom knew him personally, included Richard, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1272), a number of Henry III's councillors and <i>curiales</i>, and a variety of clerics and nobles, apart from the king himself. Some of these are known to have visited St Albans in this period, a direct and personal means for the transmission of documentary material, as well as gossip and news, which Paris then worked upon for inclusion in his various historical works. Indeed, there are a number of clear indications that it became known to many who mattered that Paris was compiling a vast, universal, contemporary history, the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, and they fed his voracious appetite for information, some naturally hoping that he would repay his debt in appropriate fashion by means of his pen. This expectation certainly lies behind his presence at Westminster for the celebration of the feast of St Edward the Confessor on 13 October 1247, when Henry III presented to his beloved abbey his recent, precious, acquisition of a vase of the holy blood. According to Paris, Henry required him to write an accurate and full account of what had transpired for the enlightenment of posterity. He then invited Paris and his companions to dinner. The event was supremely worthy of record in Henry's mind, and Paris surely attended the ceremony, doubtless at royal command, precisely because the king was already well aware of his abilities as a historical writer and wished to press them into service.<br>
<br>The two men certainly came to know each other well. Henry is known to have visited St Albans on at least nine occasions between 1220 and 1259, and these provided opportunities for discussion between monarch and monk in which Paris, or so he would have his readers believe, was frank in his views. In 1250, for example, he remonstrated with Henry for granting rights contrary to the privileges of St Albans, and for allowing others to do the same. During what was probably their last meeting, in March 1257, the two appear to have spent much time together, at table and in the king's private chamber, discussing current affairs, notably the election of Richard of Cornwall as king of the Romans, and Paris records that he took the opportunity to argue with the king on behalf of the masters of the University of Oxford in their dispute with the bishop of Lincoln. Paris was no sycophant. Indeed, he was highly opinionated, and Henry, in particular among his various informants, would not have been happy if he ever knew of the charges that Paris brought against him on various grounds, even though some were later tempered, toned down, or erased.<h2>
<a name="TravelsinEnglandandabroad"></a>Travels in England and abroad</h2>Paris's monastic routine was interrupted on other occasions, when he travelled beyond St Albans. He records that he attended the king at Winchester in July 1251, and he was most probably present at the dedication of the abbey church of Hailes, Gloucestershire, in November; the founder, Richard of Cornwall, urged him to give a correct account of the event in his chronicle. At Christmas that year he was at York, for the marriage of Henry III's daughter Margaret to Alexander III of Scotland. But the detail and vividness of his descriptions of some other events, along with the long list of contacts and informants that he acknowledges, suggest strongly that he was more frequently absent from St Albans, meeting members of the English social &eacute;lite and attending ceremonial gatherings of the court, than he himself reveals. He was undoubtedly well known to many of the great and the good and respected by them. A precious confirmation of some of his contacts, and the relationships engendered, is provided by the list of the various gifts that he had received and then left to his house, including silks and copes from Henry III, Eleanor of Provence, and H&aacute;kon IV, king of Norway.<br>
<br>King H&aacute;kon had a part to play in Paris's greatest adventure when, in 1248, he was sent by Pope Innocent IV to reform the monastery of St Benet Holm, on the island of Nidarholm in western Norway. Paris had already been involved in the house's affairs in 1246&#150;7 when, for reasons that remain unclear, he was requested by H&aacute;kon to mediate between the monks and their creditors, merchants of Cahors resident in London. He was successful, and this prior contact probably explains why it was Paris who was chosen to go to Norway himself in 1248. He describes himself as visitor to the entire Benedictine order in Norway, but the papal mandate, which he reproduces, indicates that his remit was altogether more modest, for only the abbot and monks of St Benet Holm are mentioned. His arrival in Bergen in early June 1248 occurred at a dramatic time: a great fire was raging through the city, followed by a severe thunderstorm, the lightning shattering the mast of the ship in which he had sailed. He was unharmed and visited King H&aacute;kon, who was in Bergen at the time, and delivered letters to him from Louis IX of France, requesting H&aacute;kon's participation in Louis's projected crusade and granting him victualling rights in France. Why Paris should have acted as letter-bearer and probably as a fully accredited envoy of the French king is a mystery, but if he was previously known to Louis this would strengthen any surmise that he had spent time in the schools of Paris. On completing his mission to Norway he returned home, presumably in 1249.<h2>
<a name="Illustratorandartist"></a>Illustrator and artist</h2>The paucity of detail concerning Matthew Paris's life contrasts sharply with the astonishing volume of information and material that he provides in relation to the events and issues of his contemporary world, and which renders him such an important historian. He will always be known chiefly for his historical writings, but his cultural significance extends far beyond them. As a cartographer, his contribution was considerable. He produced one world map, four versions of an itinerary from London to central or southern Italy, four maps of the Holy Land, a diagram showing the principal Roman roads of Britain, another showing the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy, and four versions of a map of Britain. The maps, in particular, are of the greatest significance, not because they were influential at the time, but because of their originality, since Paris was experimenting with cartographic concepts virtually unknown in his time and when the idea of a map was not generally understood. His interest here is closely linked to his general interest in collecting and recording information of every kind, and the same may be said of his common practice of illustrating his historical texts with paintings of the shields of individuals mentioned in them. His own observations make it plain that he had a keen interest in heraldry, leading him to reproduce nearly 300 devices, coloured and uncoloured, continental as well as English. At a critical moment in the development of heraldry these representations are precious to the historian of heraldry, and Paris was certainly one of the first to perceive the value of systematic collection of coats of arms. His interest, however, stemmed from his artist's eye and the sense of the illustrator, as well as from his awareness of the historical value of heraldry. Most of his representations occur as marginal illustrations to his historical works, the shields of the persons involved in a battle or other event described being painted in the margins of the text, or at the point when the text mentions the individual's death.<br>
<br>This urge to illustrate and extend the text pictorially also underlies the inclusion of the scores of drawings that adorn Paris's works, some 130 in the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> alone. Their attribution was once highly controversial, but on the basis of palaeographical, codicological, and stylistic analysis it is now generally agreed that, with a few exceptions, Paris was solely responsible for these drawings. Comparison between his first tentative efforts, and those more mature and polished drawings executed later in his life, strongly suggests that he was not trained as an artist but was self-taught, taking ideas from models available to him. These included the products of the goldsmiths, led by Walter of Colchester, who are known to have flourished at St Albans in Paris's time, and the illuminated manuscripts then extant in the abbey library. On the basis of these and other influences, some external to his house, Paris came to evolve a highly distinctive and personal style, eclectic, experimental, and innovative, which developed over about twenty-five years. The drawings that resulted are almost all of the same type, either line alone or tinted line. Whether he knew it or not, Paris was following an old Anglo-Saxon tradition which had been revived in England in the first decades of the thirteenth century. But as a result, in particular, of his distinctive use of tints, his extension of the range of colours applied, and his interesting blend of elements of late Romanesque and early Gothic styles, Paris contributed to a notable advance within the genre.<br>
<br>Finally, it is probable that metalworking should be included among his accomplishments, if credence is given to the words of Thomas Walsingham when he wrote his renowned eulogy and summing-up of Paris 150 years later:<blockquote>Matthew Paris, monk of St Albans and an eloquent and famous man full of immeasurable virtues, a magnificent historian and chronicler, an excellent author &hellip; Diligently compiling his chronicle from the earliest times up to the end of his life, he fully recorded the deeds of magnates, both lay and ecclesiastical, as well as various and wonderful events; and left for the notice of posterity a marvellous record of the past. He had such skill in the working of gold and silver and other metal, and in painting pictures, that it is thought that there has been no equal to him since in the Latin world. (<span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, 1.395)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Chronicamajora"></a>Chronica majora</h2>During his forty-two years at the monastery of St Albans, Matthew Paris wrote or supervised five chronicles, six hagiographies, two domestic histories, a cartulary, and a collection of fortune-telling tracts. They amount to well over a million words, most of them penned by Paris himself. Eighteen St Albans manuscripts containing his hand testify to a staggering diligence in the scriptorium. The <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> fuelled Paris's later historical reputation. A universal chronicle, it is the longest of his annalistic works, spanning two and a half manuscript volumes. Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MSS 26 and 16 (conventionally termed A and B), contain the annals from the creation to 1253, with the volume division occurring at the end of the annal for 1188. The remainder of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> (1254&#150;9) is to be found in BL, Royal MS 14 C.vii (R). These volumes comprise the original, complete manuscript of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>, much of which, after the annal for 1213, is autograph. The <span class="italic">Chronica</span>'s entries up until the mid-1230s are culled in the main from Roger of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>. Yet there is some debate as to the precise point at which Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span> ended and Paris's original contribution in the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> began. The argument for July 1235 rests in part on a marginal note occurring in B after the account of Frederick II's marriage on 20 July 1235. The note, written in a hand of <i>c</i>.1300, states that &#145;Master Roger of Wendover, once prior of Belvoir, arranged his chronicle up until this point. Here begins Brother Matthew Paris&#146;  (text B, fol. 95<i>r</i>). The earliest extant manuscripts of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span> (BL, Cotton MS Otho B.v, and Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 207) close after July 1235 with a colophon indicating that Roger of Wendover was author up to this point. However, in a copy of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> supervised by Paris (see below, C), a note similar to that in B occurs in the hand of the original rubricator at the foot of folio 252<i>r</i>, on which events of April&#150;May 1234 are described, and a heading in the Otho manuscript of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span> suggests that the work ends in 1234.<br>
<br>The authorship of the final eight folios of the annal for 1259, which are not in Paris's hand, has been disputed, yet the closing colophon is generally considered supportive of Paris's claims: &#145;Be it known that up to this point wrote the venerable brother Matthew Paris; and although the hand may vary in style, the manner of composition being retained however, the whole shall be ascribed to him&#146;  (text R, fol. 218<i>v</i>). Paris can therefore be credited with the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>'s annals for the period from either May 1234 or July 1235 to May 1259. His sources for the period 1235&#150;59 included royal letters, exchequer records, and papal documents as well as a host of informative personal acquaintances, Bishop Robert Grosseteste (<i>d</i>. 1253), Henry III, and H&aacute;kon IV of Norway among them. The <span class="italic">Chronica</span> was produced over a period of two decades, 1240&#150;59. It was completed as far as the annal for 1250 by February 1251, and the continuation from 1251 through to 1259 was not begun before 1252. Although continued into the fifteenth century, the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> was not a popular work, failing to gain wide circulation. Two copies of the section up to 1188 (A), made after Paris's death, are extant as BL, Cotton MS Nero D.v, part 1 and BL, Harley MS 1620. Paris himself supervised the copying of the section from 1189 to 1250 into BL, Cotton MS Nero D.v (termed C). This was made in or shortly after 1250, before Paris decided to continue the work beyond this year. Partial expurgation of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> in C resulted in the omission of all matters that Paris had considered, in hindsight, to be &#145;offensive&#146; to Henry III. The <span class="italic">Chronica</span> was edited for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> by H. R. Luard between 1872 and 1883, and was translated by J. A. Giles from an inferior edition under the title <span class="italic">Matthew Paris's English History</span> in 1852&#150;4.<h2>
<a name="Otherchronicles"></a>Other chronicles</h2>The <span class="italic">Chronica</span> was the prime source for Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, a selective abridgement of the text, intermingled with additional material derived from the monastic annals of Reading and Southwark. The earliest extant manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Flores</span> are Manchester, Chetham's Library, MS 6712 (Ch) (datable to the mid-thirteenth century) and Eton College, MS 123 (E) (datable to <i>c</i>.1300). A common exemplar is believed to underlie these two manuscripts. Only the annals for 1241&#150;9 in Ch (fols. 173<i>v</i>&#150;202<i>v</i>) are in Paris's hand, yet he is credited with authorship of book 1 (ending at 1066 and datable to <i>c</i>.1240&#150;45) and book 2 up until the annal for 1249 (datable to <i>c</i>.1250&#150;55). The <span class="italic">Flores</span> was previously ascribed to the mythical <a name="cosubject_29117"></a><span class="headword">Matthew  of Westminster</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>1300). The provenance of the Chetham manuscript is disputed. It has been argued that Ch was produced by Paris at St Albans for a Westminster audience and that it did not reach Westminster until after 1265. But a more recent view is that Ch up to folio 170<i>r</i> was compiled at Westminster from an adapted text by Paris. It was returned to St Albans, probably in 1256, so that Paris could insert his revised version of the annals for 1241&#150;9, and then it was sent back to Westminster. The <span class="italic">Flores</span> was edited by Luard for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> in 1890.<br>
<br>There is no doubt as to the provenance of the <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span>. Bound with the third part of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> in BL, Royal MS 14 C.vii, it is written almost exclusively in Paris's hand. Apart from abridging the autograph manuscript of <span class="italic">Chronica</span>, it draws upon Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span> and the epitome of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> in C. It omits matter that Paris had pronounced &#145;impertinent&#146; to English history in the margins of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>, and it tones down passages critical of king and pope. On the first folio of the <span class="italic">Historia</span> Paris declares that 1250 is his time of writing. By 1255 the work was complete as far as the annal for 1253 with which the work ends. Sir Frederick Madden edited the <span class="italic">Historia</span> for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> in the years 1886&#150;9.<br>
<br>Two further abridgements of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> resulted in the <span class="italic">Abbreviatio chronicorum</span> (included in volume 3 of Madden's edition of the <span class="italic">Historia</span>, 159&#150;348) and the <span class="italic">Chronica excerpta a magnis cronicis</span>. The former, covering the years 1000&#150;1255, made additional use of the <span class="italic">Historia</span>, Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span>, and Henry of Huntingdon's <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span>. It probably dates from 1255, and remains unfinished. The <span class="italic">Chronica excerpta</span> is the shortest of Paris's abridged editions of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, extending from 1066 to 1246. It is difficult to prove Paris's authorship of the work, but it was certainly written under his supervision, for he wrote some of the text himself in the unique manuscript BL, Cotton MS Vitellius A.xx (fols. 77<i>r</i>&#150;108<i>v</i>). Datable to approximately 1246&#150;59, it draws upon the <span class="italic">Abbreviatio</span>, Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span>, and the &#145;new material&#146; that Paris added in the margins of his <span class="italic">Chronica</span> (from the annals of Southwark and Reading). Several charters, Henry III's forest charter of 1225 for example, are to be found in the <span class="italic">Chronica excerpta</span>, in a less corrupt and more complete form than in any other of Paris's manuscripts.<h2>
<a name="Localhistories"></a>Local histories</h2>The universal history of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> and its abridgements found its domestic counterpart in Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum monasterii sancti Albani</span>, a work of local history which was edited by H. T. Riley for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> in the years 1867&#150;9. The <span class="italic">Gesta</span> is a history of the abbey of St Albans from 793 to 1255, arranged according to the twenty-three abbacies that spanned the period, beginning with Willegod and ending with John of Hertford. The autograph manuscript is extant as BL, Cotton MS Nero D.i, folios 30<i>r</i>&#150;62<i>r</i>, and 63<i>v</i>&#150;68<i>v</i>. How great a debt Paris owed to a twelfth-century cellarer Adam in his writing of the first eighteen lives of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> has yet to be determined. Opinion has commonly supposed that Paris made considerable use of a lost chronicle roll of Adam the Cellarer for the early section of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> ending in 1166. This belief was spawned by an ambivalent note that Paris wrote at the beginning of the autograph copy of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span>: &#145;According to the ancient roll of Bartholomew the Clerk, who was for a long while with Adam the Cellarer, serving him, and he retained for himself this roll from among his writings, choosing this one alone&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Nero D.i, fol. 30<i>r</i>). Yet the grounds for considering Adam the abbey's first domestic chronicler are not altogether firm. While the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> chronicles in some detail Adam's role in the abbey's quest for royal confirmation of its papal privileges, and his acquisition of land for the monks' kitchen, it makes no reference to his historical endeavours. It even terms him &#145;illiterate&#146;. Adam is praised in later sources for his sanctity and the healing powers of dust from his tomb. Again, there is no mention of a domestic history. Walsingham praised Wendover and Paris for their historical writings but all he could say of Adam was that he was &#145;a Martha in worldly affairs and a Mary in contemplation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales &hellip; Amundesham</span>, 2.304).<br>
<br>It is significant, too, that Wendover betrays no sign in the <span class="italic">Flores</span> that he had used or even knew of a history of St Albans. With the early lives of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> bearing Matthew Paris's stylistic imprint, it seems reasonable to conclude that Paris was responsible for their literary reconstruction of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman St Albans. The dating of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> is less contentious. The portion of the text that ends with the death of Abbot William of Trumpington (1214&#150;35) was penned some time before 1250, since the <span class="italic">Historia</span>, which was begun in this year, refers to it on five occasions. Paris resumed the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> in 1255 for, at the end of this short section, he proclaims the year in which he is writing to be the twentieth year of the abbacy of John of Hertford (1235&#150;63). Although the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> did not pass into general circulation, it was abridged in Paris's lifetime by <a name="cosubject_28565"></a><span class="headword">John  of Wallingford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1258), <span class="occ">infirmarer of St Albans</span> some time between <i>c</i>.1246&#150;7 and his death in 1258. John's historical miscellany (BL, Cotton MS Julius D.vii) was culled chiefly from the works of Paris, whose friend he was; Paris himself executed the portrait of John on folio 42<i>v</i>. The <span class="italic">Gesta</span> was continued at the end of the fourteenth century by Thomas Walsingham.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Vitae duorum Offarum</span> shares the <span class="italic">Gesta</span>'s interest in the early history of St Albans, although it might also be termed a work of hagiography. While ostensibly chronicling the reigns of Offa, a fourth-century king of the Angles, and Offa, king of Mercia (<i>r</i>. 757&#150;96), the <span class="italic">Vitae</span>'s narrative pivots on Offa of Mercia's foundation of the abbey of St Albans in fulfilment of a promise made by his earlier namesake. The antiquity of the abbey is stressed and the character of its royal founder whitewashed. Authorship of the work was once accredited to John de Cella, abbot of St Albans (1195&#150;1214), yet the discovery that it made use of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores</span> as copied into the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> resulted in its reattribution to Paris. The work is littered with stylisms characteristic of his prose. Although it precedes the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> in BL, Cotton MS Nero D.i, the <span class="italic">Vitae</span>'s later date of composition is betrayed by its closing words: &#145;The deeds of all the abbots who presided over the church of St Albans from the time of its founder, King Offa, up until the year 1250, are also described in this volume&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Historia duorum Offarum</span>, 31). The <span class="italic">Vitae</span> thus dates to <i>c</i>.1250. It was last edited by William Wats in 1639.<h2>
<a name="HagiographiesStEdmundandStThomas"></a>Hagiographies: St Edmund and St Thomas</h2>Matthew Paris's literary talents also found an outlet in hagiography. Two Latin saints' lives occupied some of his time in the 1240s and 1250s. The <span class="italic">Vita Stephani archiepiscopi Cantuariensis</span> has survived in three fragments, all written in Paris's hand (BL, Cotton MSS Vespasian B.xiii, fol. 133<i>v</i>, Nero D.i, fols. 196<i>r</i>, and a leaf attached to 196<i>v</i>). They describe the journey to Rome in 1216 of Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury (1207&#150;28), whom Paris charitably declared the equal in theology of Augustine, Gregory, and Ambrose. The fragments also contain accounts of Stephen's meeting with Innocent III, his preaching on the return journey, and the translation of Thomas Becket in 1220. They were edited by F. Liebermann in <span class="italic">Ungedruckte anglo-normannische Geschichtsquellen</span> in 1879. Paris's <span class="italic">Vita beati Edmundi</span> documents the life and sanctity of a later archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Rich (1234&#150;40). It is extant only as a fourteenth-century copy, in BL, Cotton MS Julius D.vi, folios 123&#150;156<i>v</i>. Although initially attributed to Eustace, a monk of Canterbury, the work has lain firmly at Paris's feet since the late 1890s. It was written some time after 1247, for it contains a letter of Richard of Wyche recounting the translation of St Edmund in June 1247, and it must have been completed before 1253 for it refers to the French queen Blanche of Castile as still living. A date nearer 1247 than 1253 would explain the apparent use made of this work by the <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span>. The <span class="italic">Vita</span> is based on a collection of materials made at Pontigny, but it depends also on information supplied by Richard of Wyche, Robert Bacon, and Edmund's brother, Robert of Abingdon. It was published in 1996 in an English translation by C. H. Lawrence.<br>
<br>Paris translated his Latin life of Edmund into Anglo-Norman octosyllabic verse for the <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Edmond</span>, one of his four vernacular saints' lives. A late thirteenth- or early fourteenth-century copy of the work was discovered at Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire, at the beginning of the twentieth century, compensating in part for the loss of another copy of the work (BL, Cotton MS Vitellius D.viii) in the Cottonian fire of 1731. Paris's claim to the authorship of <span class="italic">Edmond</span> rests on three pieces of evidence. First, it is dedicated to Isabel de Warenne, countess of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1282), who had also borrowed Paris's lives of Thomas Becket and Edward the Confessor. Second, the author says that he has written the life of Edmund in two languages and the source for <span class="italic">Edmond</span> is, as stated above, Paris's Latin life of the saint. Third, the author discloses his name&#151;Maheu (Matthew)  (Paris, <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Edmond</span>, 1.1692). A recent suggestion that <span class="italic">Edmond</span> is the work of an anonymous translator has yet to gain acceptance. It was written some time after 1253, for the reference to a living Queen Blanche in the Latin life is lent a posthumous feel in <span class="italic">Edmond</span>. <span class="italic">Edmond</span> was probably the latest of Paris's Anglo-Norman hagiographies. It was edited by A. T. Baker in <span class="italic">Romania</span> in 1929.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Thomas de Cantorb&eacute;ry</span> drew its inspiration from the twelfth-century <span class="italic">Quadrilogus</span>. P. Meyer edited the <span class="italic">Vie</span> for the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Anciens Textes Fran&ccedil;ais in 1885. While there is general agreement that the four extant leaves (BL, Loans MS 88, not in Paris's hand) date from <i>c</i>.1220&#150;30 to 1240, opinion is divided as to their provenance and their author. Some consider them a close, &#145;first&#146; copy of Paris's lost autograph manuscript, executed in the scriptorium of St Albans during Paris's lifetime. Others argue for their production in London by an unknown poet; it is suggested that Paris was not the creator of the first Anglo-Norman version of the <span class="italic">Vie</span>, and that the leaves have nothing to do with him. The evidence for the former position is twofold. In a note on the flyleaf of his <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Auban</span> in TCD, MS 177, Paris mentions &#145;a book about St Thomas the Martyr and St Edward which I translated and illustrated [<i>transtuli et protraxi</i>]&#146;. Over a century later Thomas Walsingham stated that Paris had &#145;written and most elegantly illustrated&#146; (<i>conscripsit et depinxit elegantissime</i>) lives of saints Alban, Amphibalus, and the archbishops Thomas and Edmund  (BL, Cotton MS Claudius E.iv, fol. 331<i>v</i>). Textual and stylistic similarities between <span class="italic">Thomas</span> and these other lives appear to confirm common authorship. The evidence for the view that Paris did not write <span class="italic">Thomas</span> hangs on an interpretation of the word <i>transtuli</i>. It is suggested that Paris may have meant simply that he had &#145;transferred&#146; an existing saint's life into his own manuscript.<h2>
<a name="HagiographiesStEdwardandStAlban"></a>Hagiographies: St Edward and St Alban</h2>If, as seems probable, Matthew Paris was the author of <span class="italic">Thomas</span>, then the implication of Paris's Dublin note is that he wrote it about the same time as his <span class="italic">Estoire de Seint Aedward le Rei</span>, for they were originally in the same book. The <span class="italic">Estoire</span>'s most recent editor, K. Y. Wallace, who edited the text for the Anglo-Norman Text Society in 1983, confines it to the period 1236&#150;45. Attempts to date it to the 1250s have failed to gain support. The <span class="italic">Estoire</span> is a verse hagiography of King Edward the Confessor. He was staunch in his repulsion of foreigners, wise in his dependence on baronial counsel, and his reign was a paradigm of conciliatory kingship&#151;the Edward of the <span class="italic">Estoire</span> was everything Paris wished for in Henry III. Paris's dedication of the work to Henry's queen, Eleanor of Provence, possibly sought to communicate these wishes. The provenance of the earliest extant manuscript of the <span class="italic">Estoire</span>, CUL, MS Ee.iii.59, is debated. It has generally been labelled a close copy and adaptation of the prototype by Paris, executed at St Albans during the 1250s. More recent assessments favour London as its place of origin. The Cambridge manuscript, it is suggested, was a metropolitan copy of between <i>c</i>.1250&#150;55 and 1260, produced perhaps for Eleanor of Castile, daughter-in-law of Henry III, about the time of her marriage to Prince Edward in 1254.<br>
<br>Attitudes regarding the authorship of the text it contains are similarly shifting. A monk of Westminster initially received credit for the work. He was ousted by Matthew Paris in 1920. Paris's authorship of <span class="italic">Edward</span> rests on the documentary foundations shared by <span class="italic">Thomas</span>, namely the Dublin note and the statement by Walsingham. Although the <span class="italic">Estoire</span>'s latest editor has fought Paris's corner, an attempt has also been made to credit the work to an anonymous poet. This poet, it is suggested, may be identified with the poet to whom is dubiously attributed the authorship of <span class="italic">Edmond</span>. A recent resurrection of a theory that Henry d'Avranches (<i>d</i>. 1262/3) was author of the <span class="italic">Estoire</span> rests on a statement in the exchequer liberate rolls of 1244&#150;5 that a certain Henry the Versifier was paid &pound;10 for his writing of the lives of saints Edward and George. Yet the majority rally round Paris, while acknowledging that the extant copy hails from Westminster. For the most part the <span class="italic">Estoire</span> constitutes a free translation of Ailred of Rievaulx's <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi Confessoris</span>, with an introductory section derived from Ailred's <span class="italic">Genealogia regum Anglorum</span>. Yet it also made use of Paris's <span class="italic">Flores</span>, and this may explain the Westminster angle that led earlier commentators to ascribe the <span class="italic">Estoire</span> to a Westminster monk. In addition, Paris sprinkled the text with original material; his detailed description of Edward's church at Westminster probably sprang from firsthand observation of the abbey before it began to be rebuilt in the 1240s.<br>
<br>Paris's <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Auban</span> is his only vernacular saint's life extant in the autograph. Both the text and illustrations of the <span class="italic">Vie</span> in TCD, MS 177 (fols. 29<i>v</i>&#150;50) were executed by Paris himself, at a date that has yet to be firmly established. Scholarship in the 1950s and 1960s settled on the decade 1230&#150;40 for production of <span class="italic">Alban</span> and this was a dating with which the work's only editor, A. R. Harden, concurred  (Paris, <span class="italic">Vie de Seint Auban</span>, xv&#150;xvii). It was argued that <span class="italic">Alban</span> was probably the first of Paris's Anglo-Norman saints' lives, for its handwriting and illustrations were tidy and controlled and it was written in archaic alexandrine <i>laisses</i> instead of the octosyllabic couplets of the other three lives. Recent studies, however, have placed the work a decade or so later, in the 1240s and early 1250s. It is suggested that Paris began <span class="italic">Alban</span> in the 1240s, temporarily suspended work on it when he visited Norway in 1248&#150;9, and finished it on his return. <span class="italic">Alban</span> is a verse hagiography of England's first Christian martyr, who died in the third century. The central theme of conflict between Christian and pagan dictates its epic form. William of St Albans's twelfth-century Latin life of Alban, of which <span class="italic">Alban</span> is a literal, vernacular translation, was written out by Paris himself in the Dublin manuscript. <span class="italic">Alban</span> was produced for a monastic audience and the Dublin manuscript is probably that to which Thomas Walsingham refers when he tells of Paris's Lives of saints Alban and Amphibalus.<h2>
<a name="Subsidiaryworks"></a>Subsidiary works</h2>A short genealogical chronicle, a collection of fortune-telling tracts, and a cartulary comprise the remainder of Matthew Paris's written legacy. His genealogical chronicle, <span class="italic">Cronica sub conpendio abreviata a fratre M. Parisiensi</span>, appears in three different versions on the opening and closing leaves of his manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> and <span class="italic">Abbreviatio</span> (text A, fols. iv<i>v</i> and 285, text B, fol. iii<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>, and BL, Cotton MS Claudius D.vi, fols. 6<i>v</i>&#150;8<i>r</i>). Sketching the reigns of the kings of England from Alfred onwards, this work proved to be popular outside St Albans, for two contemporary copies are known to exist. Paris's collection of fortune-telling tracts is extant in a single autograph manuscript. Decorative portraits of Socrates, Plato, Euclid, and Pythagorus adorn the pages of Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 304, which is datable to 1240&#150;50. Prognostic works, including the <span class="italic">Experimentarius</span> of Bernard of Chartres, constitute the bulk of this volume.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Liber additamentorum</span>  (BL, Cotton MS Nero D.i) was the name by which Paris himself referred to his cartulary. The documents contained therein are those mentioned by Paris in his historical chronicles, and they span the years 1242&#150;59. A number of earlier St Albans charters and papal privileges complete the collection. The <span class="italic">Liber</span> began as a small appendix of documents at the end of the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>'s annal for 1250; after the annal for 1247 Paris no longer wished to clutter his text with documentary transcripts. This appendix, which survives as folios 85&#150;100, was detached <i>c</i>.1251&#150;3 when Paris decided to continue the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> beyond 1250. It became part of a separate volume of miscellaneous material (BL, Cotton MS Nero D.i), which also contains the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> and the <span class="italic">Vitae Offarum</span>. Most of the <span class="italic">Liber</span> was pieced together in the last ten years of Paris's life. B's documentary appendix, however, was produced before 1250, and the series of St Albans charters and privileges which occupy folios 149&#150;61 had an even earlier genesis. Instead of compiling this series himself, as was previously thought, Paris copied it from a twelfth-century St Albans cartulary which is preserved, in a seventeenth-century hand, in the Bollandist manuscript Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS 7965&#150;7973 (3723), folios 151<i>r</i>&#150;216<i>v</i>. The order of charters relating to the abbey's early endowment in the Brussels manuscript is the same as that found in the <span class="italic">Liber</span>. Paris's alterations comprised the omission of vernacular boundary clauses, which suggests that he felt uncomfortable with Old English. Thus the <span class="italic">Liber</span>, which was once considered the abbey's first cartulary, reproduces and extends a cartulary compiled a century earlier.<h2>
<a name="Laterinfluence"></a>Later influence</h2>Beyond St Albans, where his chronicles at any rate were known to Thomas Walsingham, a great admirer, Matthew Paris's works were largely unknown in the later middle ages. Only the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, of which there were a number of continuations, enjoyed some popularity. His reputation began to revive with Polydore Vergil (<i>d</i>. 1555), who set Paris and William of Malmesbury (<i>d</i>. 1142) on a pedestal apart from other medieval chroniclers, but it was the Reformation that led to a notable renewal of interest in his work largely because his acid-sharp anti-papal streak inevitably appealed to protestant scholars. As John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563) commented to Archbishop Matthew Parker (<i>d</i>. 1575), &#145;no chronycle paynteth out the byshopp of Rome in more lively colours, nor more lyvely declareth hys execrable procedynges&#146;  (Levy, 96). It was Parker himself who produced the first printed editions of <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> in 1567, and of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> (from 1066 onwards), in 1571, drawing attention in the process to Paris's exposure of the pride, greed, and tyranny of the pope. A similar position was taken up by such other historians as Edward Hall (<i>d</i>. 1547), John Stow (<i>d</i>. 1605), and John Hayward (<i>d</i>. 1627). The learned puritan controversialist William Prynne (<i>d</i>. 1669), too, clearly knew Matthew Paris's chronicles well, and drew upon them for anti-Roman ammunition. Paris was also important, moreover, for the growing opposition to the Stuart monarchy, as the source for the received text of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, even though he presents a conflation, inherited from Roger of Wendover, of the version of 1215 and the reissues of 1217 and 1225. Only the exceptionally learned John Selden (<i>d</i>. 1654) appears to have noticed this. Against this background of controversy the edition of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> (also from 1066 onwards) which was published in 1640 by William Wats (<i>d</i>. 1649), appears as the epitome of moderation, despite anti-papal invective in the introduction.<br>
<br>Wats's edition was reprinted in 1644 and 1684, and no doubt this was the text used by Sir William Dugdale (<i>d</i>. 1686) and other historians and antiquarians in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. However, Paris fell from sight in the later eighteenth century as medieval scholarship gave way to the Gothicizing antiquarianism of Horace Walpole (<i>d</i>. 1797) and his contemporaries, although a copy of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> in the edition of 1684 was one of the very few medieval English narrative sources recorded in the library of Edward Gibbon at the time of the historian's death in 1791. Another change in literary and historical fashion, identifiable with the influence of Romanticism, seems to have been needed to bring about a renewed interest in Matthew Paris in the nineteenth century. That this was a development led by fashion rather than scholarship, at least initially, is suggested by the fact that English translations of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> and <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> were published in 1852&#150;4 and 1853 respectively, although, remarkably, they were preceded by a French translation published in 1840&#150;41. These works were published before the scholarly editions of Paris's chief historical works appeared in the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. Sir Frederick Madden's edition of the <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span> (1866&#150;9), and H. R. Luard's editions of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> (1872&#150;84) and <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> (1890), provided texts altogether more reliable than those of Wats and Parker, and they remain the standard editions of these works. They also furthered significantly the understanding of Paris and his works through their accompanying editorial apparatuses, and thus helped to make further advances possible, notably in the work of V. H. Galbraith, who elucidated such issues as the transmission of Paris's texts and the relationship of his work to that of Roger of Wendover, and in the comprehensive monograph study of Richard Vaughan (1958), the first to consider Paris's talents, interests, and productions as a whole.<h2>
<a name="Styleandmethod"></a>Style and method</h2>Despite a well-provisioned library, as evidenced by the twelfth-century catalogue of Walter the Chanter, the historiographical flowering of St Albans postdated that of other monastic institutions by several decades. Its successful propagation required a well-equipped scriptorium and creative personalities. St Albans possessed wealth for the former. Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris contributed the latter. For a man who disclosed so few autobiographical details, Paris found intrusion of private thoughts and prejudices upon his works remarkably easy. Monastic humility battled with historical subjectivity. Foreigners riled him. The Savoyards and the Poitevins, he felt, greedily fattened themselves on English revenues and deprived native Englishmen of wealth and rank. The French as a whole he denounced as proud and effeminate. Yet Paris's xenophobia did not feed upon rife patriotism. Although the persistent incursions of the devious Welsh into English territory irritated him, he could admire their bravery, which he considered infinitely preferable to the imbecility and gullibility of the English. The English displayed these characteristics, said Paris, in the face of papal avarice.<br>
<br>Paris's hatred of the papacy spawned many a torrid passage in the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>. He considered its draining of ecclesiastical revenues, and its intrusion of Italians into positions of prominence within the English church, to be evidence of loose morals. Its morals, he said, were those of a prostitute. It practised usury and simony in an endeavour to satisfy its insatiable greed. The secular arm of divine authority fared no better in Paris's hands. Henry III suffered a barrage of criticisms, ranging from poor financial management to cowardice and self-indulgence. He preferred foreign over native counsel, he obstructed abbatial and episcopal elections, and he violated his coronation oaths. He was indecisive, bending one way and another like a reed in the wind. Together, king and papacy comprised the &#145;two millstones&#146; between which England was metaphorically crushed. Paris was fond of such imagery; commenting upon the detrimental effect of pope and foreigner on the material wealth of England, he likened his country to a vineyard without a wall, open to plunder by all.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris's irreverent attitude to authority has been lavishly termed &#145;constitutionalism&#146;, and his <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> labelled an <i>apologia pro baronibus</i>. That constitutional matters held some fascination for Paris is certain. Frenzied assaults on taxation, royal extortion, forest inquisitions, and itinerant justices constitute some of the most vibrant passages in the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>. His constitutional sensitivities also operated in the domestic arena. His support for the convent in the question of an abbot's right to banish monks to distant cells is evidenced by the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>. The latter text, in addition, maps out the procedures of abbatial elections, such as that of John of Hertford in 1235, with painstaking attention to detail. Yet Paris's constitutional interests appear amateur. They give no impression of having coagulated into coherent political theory. He no more conceived of the <i>communitas regni</i> wielding complete power over a monarch than he conceived of monks ruling abbots. Even his thoughts on the events of 1258 and the implications of baronial reform lack complexity. As a Benedictine monk he lived within the constraints of a traditional hierarchy. This, in itself, may serve to explain why his constitutional leanings lack the definition and impetus that characterize his other attitudes and prejudices.<br>
<br>Ardent though Paris's prejudices may have been, they never choked his narratives. Documentary evidence comprised the backbone of his historical methodology. 350 documents are preserved in the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> and <span class="italic">Liber additamentorum</span>. He knew that it was his duty to adhere to the facts. &#145;The lot of historians&#146;, he said, &#145;is hard indeed, for, if they speak the truth, they provoke man, and if they record falsehoods, they offend God&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron.</span>, 5.469&#150;70). Divine displeasure did not prevent him from tampering with documents. Noble intentions floundered beneath his burning desire to communicate a personal vision of the world. He lent an anti-papal slant to a letter of Patriarch Germanos of Constantinople to Pope Gregory IX written in 1232 but included in the <span class="italic">Chronica</span>'s annal for 1237. Germanos laments the tyranny of the papacy, holding it responsible for the disharmony between the Greek and Roman churches. Interpolations provided literary release for Paris's staunch convictions. In describing a dispute over three knights' fees in Horncastle between Hugh Fitzralph and Silvester of Everdon, bishop of Carlisle (<i>d</i>. 1254), he relished attacking the royal absolutism that he felt stamped the actions of the king's agents in the affair, misrepresenting the facts in the process. Furthermore, Paris's ahistorical acquittal of King Offa of Mercia of the murder of &AElig;thelberht of East Anglia in 794, undertaken in the <span class="italic">Vitae Offarum</span>, stemmed from little more than loyalty to the founder of St Albans. On occasion, Paris can be charged with plain carelessness rather than wilful adulteration. His pastiche of the <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> originated in a thoughtless conflation of the version of 1215 with the reissues of 1217 and 1225, inherited from Roger of Wendover. He had failed to question whether the charters of John and Henry were significantly different.<h2>
<a name="Thehistorianandhisoutlook"></a>The historian and his outlook</h2>The scholarly liberties Matthew Paris claimed render his works unreliable in places. Yet he was not consistently inept. Neither was he an obsessive trickster. The accurate transmission of documents was not beyond his technical mastery. His account of Henry III's speech at the exchequer in October 1256 can be checked against the exchequer memoranda rolls and it fares well. Many of the writs and charters that he copied into the <span class="italic">Liber additamentorum</span> from the twelfth-century cartulary of the abbey remain faithful to their originals. He alternated fraudulence with precision, prejudice with impartiality. A recent description of him as &#145;tolerably accurate&#146; captures the duality of his approach. He battled to control his material, shaping and tailoring hundreds of documents and endless amounts of detail into a narrative style. Success could never be unqualified. His historical works as a whole were shifting entities, undergoing endless stages of revision and censorship. They were flighty works, diverse in content. In his sprightly if crude Latin, Paris told of a thunderbolt which struck the queen's bedroom in 1251, crushing her bed to a powder, and a disease that drove cows mad in the autumn of 1252. He wondered sometimes like a child. The sparkling disintegration of a comet in 1239 seemed to him the fiery trail of a dragon.<br>
<br>Paris's fascination with the world probably fed on his uneasy conviction that human history was drawing to a close. For most of his life he laboured under the notion that time would end in 1250. Apocalyptic verses conclude the <span class="italic">Chronica</span> in this year, although Paris had later to resume the work when the last judgment failed to occur. Within Paris's closed historical chronology the wheel, or die, of fortune played havoc with men's lives and tempered human joys with human woes. In maudlin moments he lamented the deceptive and transitory nature of earthly events. Yet melancholia was not his favourite state. His works bear the hallmark of an effervescent imagination partially constrained by scholarly purpose and historical integrity. Together they comprise a spirited and evocative portrayal of political and intellectual life in England and Europe in the first half of the thirteenth century.<br>
