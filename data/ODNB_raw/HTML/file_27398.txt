<span class="headword">Thrupp,  John</span>  (1817&#150;1870), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 5 February 1817 at Spanish Place, Manchester Square, London, the eldest son of John Augustus Thrupp (1785&#150;1844), coach maker, and his wife, Caroline Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cutmore. His father was the eldest son of Joseph Thrupp of Paddington Green and his first wife, Mary Burgon. The sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27397/', "Frederick Thrupp")</script> was his uncle, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27399/', "Joseph Francis Thrupp")</script>, religious writer, was a cousin. Thrupp was baptized on 2 January 1818 at St Marylebone, and was educated at Dr Laing's school at Clapham. He was articled in 1834 and admitted a solicitor in 1838; he practised afterwards at Bell Yard, Doctors' Commons. He married, on 5 October 1843, Mary (1816/17&#150;1852), daughter of Jonas Hall Pope, surgeon.<br>
<br>Thrupp's first book, <span class="italic">Historical Law Tracts</span> (1843), demonstrates his early fascination with both history and the origin and evolution of laws, particularly those relating to marriage and parental authority, but also to slavery, property, and criminal jurisprudence. &#145;The history of a nation&#146;, he contended, &#145;is in its laws&#146;  (p. 5). His book was well received and, after the death in 1844 of his father who left him a competency, he became a regular correspondent on a wide range of historical, judicial, and cultural themes in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Ethnological Society, and wrote for the journal of the latter. Through his interests in chess and the history of civilization he became an associate of the better-known Henry Thomas Buckle.<br>
<br>Thrupp's second book was <span class="italic">The Anglo-Saxon home: a history of the domestic institutions and customs of England from the fifth to the eleventh century</span> (1862), in which he credited the assistance of his friend and fellow historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30063/', "Thomas Wright")</script>. Concerned to &#145;give a true picture of the domestic life of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers&#146;, and &#145;to trace the gradual development among them of the domestic affections and of the morals and manners of private life&#146;  (p. 1), Thrupp reviewed a vast quantity of &#145;laws and legal documents&#146;, which he regarded as &#145;by far the most trustworthy and valuable evidence&#146;  (p. iii), though he also used archaeological sources to underline his conclusion that &#145;the social history of the Anglo-Saxons exhibits a state of moral and domestic improvement, and that this advance may be mainly traced to the influence of the Christian religion, and of Roman laws and literature, and to the adventurous self-reliant spirit of the Anglo-Saxon race&#146;  (p. 407). The work is of its time, and is seldom now consulted.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife Thrupp married Sarah Maria (<i>d</i>. 1856), the younger daughter of Edward Crowley of Lavender Hill, Wandsworth, on 21 September 1854. He married, thirdly, on 26 July 1860, Susan (1820&#150;1912), daughter of William Eley. He had no children. He evidently suffered from illness, possibly of a neurological kind; he gave up chess in 1856 on the advice of his doctor, and ceased professional practice in 1867. He died of &#145;paralysis&#146;  (d. cert.) at his home, Sunnyside, Falkland Road, Dorking, on 20 January 1870. All his personal effects passed to his third wife.<br>
