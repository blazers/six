<span class="headword">Angus,  Joseph</span>  (1816&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and educationist</span>, was born on 16 January 1816 at Bolam, Northumberland, the only son of John Angus, a farmer and later a leather merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Wanless. His first schooling was at the free grammar school, Newcastle, under George Ferris Whidborne Mortimer, who wanted to send him to Cambridge. As a nonconformist and a member of a Baptist church, Angus preferred Edinburgh University, which he entered in 1834, after spending a year at King's College, London. In 1835 he studied for the Baptist ministry at Stepney College (which later became Regent's Park College, Oxford). Returning to Edinburgh with a scholarship he graduated MA with distinction in 1837, and won the gold medal in moral philosophy and the university English essay prize.<br>
<br>Early the next year Angus accepted a call to New Park Street Chapel, Southwark. From 1838 to 1844 he was secretary of Stepney College and negotiated its affiliation with the new University of London. In 1840 he was appointed joint secretary with John Dyer of the Baptist Missionary Society, and became sole secretary on Dyer's death in 1841. He was heavily involved in raising the jubilee fund of some &pound;32,000, which allowed the society to repay its debts, extend mission operations, and construct a new headquarters.<br>
<br>Angus married on 3 March 1841 Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1893), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11777/', "William Brodie Gurney")</script>, treasurer of the Baptist Missionary Society; they had nine surviving children. Amelia Angus served as foreign secretary of the Baptist Zenana Mission from 1869 to 1893. On her death, two of their daughters, Amelia and Edith, filled the office as joint secretaries. Another daughter, Isabel Marion (1858&#150;1939), was a missionary in India for the Baptist Zenana Mission from 1882 to 1907, when she was appointed the society's general secretary in India.<br>
<br>In 1849 Angus was appointed president of Stepney College. During the forty-four years of his presidency, he increased the importance of the college within the denomination and raised a special fund of &pound;30,000 to equip it with new professorial chairs and scholarships. The college moved to palatial premises in Regent's Park in 1856. In connection with his academic work Angus published handbooks to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1853), to the English language (1864), and to English literature (1866), as well as an edition (1855) of Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy</span> and <span class="italic">Sermons</span> and Francis Wayland's <span class="italic">Elements of Moral Science</span> (1858). The handbooks were especially popular. In recognition of his achievements at Regent's Park College, he was elected president of the Baptist Union in 1865.<br>
<br>From 1859 to 1869 Angus was examiner in English to London University, and in 1865 to the civil service commissioners. From 1870 to 1880 he devoted much time to the committee revising the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. He was elected in 1870 for Marylebone to the first London school board, held office for ten years, and was re-elected for the period 1894&#150;7. Along with W. H. Smith MP, he supported non-denominational <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading in schools. He took the greatest interest in the bibliography of Baptist authors; his own collection of such works was unsurpassed, and forms the core of the Angus Library housed at Regent's Park College. His summary account, &#145;Baptist authors and history, 1527&#150;1800&#146;, was printed in the <span class="italic">Baptist Hand-Book</span> in 1894, and was issued separately in 1896. The hallmark of his ministry and educational career was a firm, typically evangelical, reliance on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was the author of several prize essays, and published many of his lectures and sermons. He died at his home, Ellerdale, in Hampstead on 28 August 1902 and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
