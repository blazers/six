<span class="headword">Rackstraw,  Marjorie</span>  (1888&#150;1981), <span class="occ">educationist and social worker</span>, was born in Highgate, Middlesex, on 24 June 1888, the second of five daughters of Matthew Rackstraw and his wife, Fanny (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Blofeld). The early death of his father obliged Matthew Rackstraw to abandon professional ambitions and enter trade. The Blofeld family were dealers in Smithfield; several of them became liverymen of the Butchers' Company. Matthew Rackstraw bought two small shops in Upper Street, Islington, then a fashionable neighbourhood, and with his sister in charge of staff welfare built up a thriving department store. He sold it when trade began to move westwards to new stores such as Selfridge's. The family lived in a handsome house in Cholmondeley Park on Highgate Hill, moving as the girls left home to a smaller but still substantial house in North Grove, Highgate village. Matthew had been a paternalistic employer. He was also a good father of daughters, giving each educational opportunities and a share of his fortune, enabling her to choose her way of life.<br>
<br>During her schooldays at the Grove School, Highgate, Marjorie Rackstraw developed spinal trouble, possibly undiagnosed polio. She was sent to a school for invalids at Margate and spent long periods on her back. A spinal disability remained throughout life but she never accepted it as an impediment to service. Her elder sister Frances (Nancy) went from the Grove School to Somerville College, Oxford. Marjorie, it is said, was offered a place at Somerville on returning from a year in France, but her parents judged that Birmingham was a healthier place than Oxford. In Birmingham, Margery Fry, fourteen years older than Marjorie, was warden of University House, a fine purpose-built residence for women: they became lifelong friends. After studying history, Marjorie in 1912 took the undifferentiated arts degree then available and went for a year to Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania. She returned to Birmingham to assist her friend at University House, but when the older woman left to work with the Friends' War Victims Relief Committee among refugees on the Marne, Marjorie soon followed her. &#145;She is champing to be off&#146;, wrote Margery Fry in July 1915. In 1920 Marjorie volunteered for relief work in Russia and remained there through the famine, beloved, it was said, by both colleagues and Russian peasants.<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1937 Marjorie was warden of Masson Hall, Edinburgh University, and adviser to the women students. She gave advice on accommodation and future careers, and took a close interest in the social life of the women students. It seems that she was hoping to plan a new hall. Proposals for this appear as early as 1931 but the new hall was not opened until 1965, long after she had left. She was a generous contributor: a part of the hall and a bursary bear her name. She had while in Edinburgh joined the Fabian Society.<br>
<br>In 1937 Marjorie bought 1 Keats Grove, Hampstead, her home for the rest of her life. Spare rooms were soon occupied for long or short periods by former students, refugees, and friends from a wide circle. She became involved in voluntary and public work, much of it linked with her local Labour Party. In 1944 she volunteered for work abroad with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and was in the first team to enter Germany from France. But in the following year she was back in Hampstead, having been elected during her absence as a Labour councillor. She served on many committees before she retired from the council in 1951.<br>
<br>Marjorie's special concern for elderly people who, during the war, had lost their homes through bombing in eastern and southern parts of London and had been rehoused in makeshift accommodation in an unfamiliar district, led in 1947 to the foundation of the Hampstead Old People's Housing Trust, of which she remained chair until her eightieth year. Large houses, standing empty, were bought and converted into homes for elderly people. Marjorie, who valued her own garden, insisted that the gardens should be brought back into cultivation, often by the residents themselves. One house was a bequest from a lady who wished it to accommodate &#145;gentlefolk&#146;. The historian of the association says, &#145;No difficulty arose over the interpretation of that phrase.&#146;<br>
<br>After visiting a former housemaid in the newly furbished attic which she had once shared as a bleak bedroom with other servants, Marjorie remarked, &#145;You could hardly find anyone gentler.&#146; The association's first purpose-built block of flats, occupied in 1968, was called Rackstraw House; Marjorie, who had resisted the idea of naming it after her, finally agreed because the family name would die out with her.<br>
<br>Marjorie Rackstraw was tall, and angular in her movements because of her disability. &#145;She peeps out of her house like a good kind witch,&#146; said a child. Her strong features bore a habitual expression of happy benevolence, and she had a memorable ringing laugh. Though she had worked with Quakers, she did not attend their religious meetings. She remained an Anglican, though not a regular churchgoer. She died at home, in her sleep, on 28 April 1981, and was cremated at Golders Green on 5 May.<br>
