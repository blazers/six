<span class="headword">Bonnar,  William</span>  (1800&#150;1853), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of a house-painter. He showed artistic talent at an early age and was apprenticed to one of the leading decorative artists of the day; after some time he became foreman of the business. When George IV visited Edinburgh in 1822 Bonnar helped David Roberts to decorate the Assembly Rooms in George Street for the state ball. Shortly after this Captain Basil Hall recognized the quality of his work, having seen some signboards that Bonnar had painted, and encouraged Bonnar to become a professional artist. This he did in 1824, when he exhibited <span class="italic">The Tinkers</span> at Waterloo Place. This painting was well received and five years later Bonnar was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Academy, which had been founded the previous year, in 1828. He was also presented with the Hope and Cockburn award.<br>
<br>Bonnar specialized in rural scenes, pictures of children, and humorous subjects that show the influence of David Wilkie, such as <span class="italic">Showing the New Dress</span> (1829), <span class="italic">The Blessing</span> (1832), and <span class="italic">The Orphans</span> (1838). He was often inspired by Scottish literary sources such as the life and works of Robert Burns, as in <span class="italic">The Cottar's Saturday Night</span> (1839), Allan Ramsay, as in <span class="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</span>, and the works of Sir Walter Scott, as in <span class="italic">Jessie Deans in the Robber's Barn</span> (1836), <span class="italic">Kilmeny's Return</span> (1838), and <span class="italic">Caleb Balderstone Burnishing the Pewter Flagon</span> (1840). He also painted historical subjects including <span class="italic">The First Sermon of John Knox, in the Castle of St Andrews</span> and <span class="italic">King Robert Bruce and the Spider</span> (1840). Bonnar was a popular and prolific artist and many of his paintings were engraved. Latterly he concentrated on painting portraits, many of which were engraved by his sons. These include <span class="italic">Portrait of John Blackie Senior</span> (Glasgow Art Gallery), <span class="italic">Thomas Chalmers</span>, <span class="italic">William Cunningham</span>, <span class="italic">George Kemp</span>, and <span class="italic">Isabella Begg</span> (all Scot. NPG), and a self-portrait (NG Scot.).<br>
<br>Bonnar died in London Street, Edinburgh, on 27 January 1853. His son William Bonnar junior (<i>fl</i>. 1849) also became a painter.<br>
