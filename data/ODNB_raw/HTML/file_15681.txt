<span class="headword">Kirkwood,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1711<span class="mult">x</span>20), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and grammarian</span>, was a native of Dunbar. At the time that he was first approached to be schoolmaster in Linlithgow, in May 1674, he was acting as tutor, or &#145;governour&#146;, to Lord Bruce at the Old College, Glasgow, where he lodged with Gilbert Burnet, then professor of divinity. Kirkwood accepted the offer from Sir Robert Milne of Barntoun, the provost of Linlithgow, in January 1675 on terms that he maintained involved a fixed annual salary of 400 merks and tenure <i>ad vitam aut culpam</i>. On 1 August of that year he married Gelecina van Beest, with whom he had at least seven children. His school enjoyed a considerable reputation and it was attended by John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair, who also boarded with Kirkwood, presumably after the accident in 1682 in which he shot his brother.<br>
<br>In 1689 Kirkwood found himself at odds with the new town council, apparently because of his continuing adherence to episcopalianism. In taking up the post he had replaced a schoolmaster, David Skeoch, who had been removed for attending presbyterian conventicles. As Kirkwood showed little willingness to adapt to the changed political circumstances his salary was reduced to 300 merks in October 1689 and he lived under the threat of further sanctions. In the following February he, his pregnant wife, and their children were forcibly ejected from their home. Having withdrawn temporarily to Edinburgh, Kirkwood exacted a twin revenge, pursuing his cause against the town council through the courts while at the same time publishing an extensive account of his sufferings; <span class="italic">A short information of the plea betwixt the town council of Lithgow and Mr James Kirkwood, schoolmaster there, whereof a more full account may perhaps come out hereafter</span> appeared in 1690. Kirkwood redeemed his promise in an extended version, <span class="italic">The History of the Twenty Seven Gods of Linlithgow</span> (1711). The title referred to the council's charge that he was a reviler of the gods of the people; Kirkwood interpreted &#145;gods&#146; to mean the twenty-seven members of the town council. The council was fined 4000 merks in 1692 but as late as 1711 Kirkwood complained that he had received nothing by way of reparation.<br>
<br>Initially without employment Kirkwood then set up a private school in Edinburgh before becoming schoolmaster at Kelso at the invitation of the countess of Roxburghe. Kirkwood maintained that he had accepted the offer in preference to other positions, including the professorship of humanity in St Andrews University and a similar post in Virginia. This increased his displeasure when conflicts arose. The position of schoolmaster would normally have been held jointly with the offices of precentor and session clerk; Kirkwood was unacceptable to the kirk session in these roles but without the conjunction of offices his salary was naturally diminished. His dispute with the local minister, William Jack (or Jacque), and the kirk session were chronicled in <span class="italic">Mr Kirkwood's Plea before the Kirk, and Civil Judicatures of Scotland</span> (1698). Wild allegations were made: among other things Kirkwood was accused of trying to force his attentions on a woman servant of Sir John Home of Blackadder and using obscene expressions in explaining Latin words to his scholars. Once again the root of the issue was suspicion of Kirkwood's episcopalian sympathies, although even here the truth remains elusive and Kirkwood denied, for example, that he had served the episcopalian meeting-house as session clerk. Unsuccessful in pursuit of the offices to which he felt himself entitled, he appears to have continued in his role as schoolmaster until succeeded by David Chrystie in 1708.<br>
<br>As a grammarian Kirkwood based his reputation on his <span class="italic">Grammatica facilis</span> (1674). In 1678 he published a <span class="italic">Rhetoricae compendium</span>. Just after his ejection from Linlithgow, and at the suggestion of Lord Stair, he was consulted by the commissioners for colleges and schools as to the best Latin grammar to be used in Scottish schools. When asked his opinion of Despauter's grammar he opined that &#145;if its superfluities were rescinded, the defects supply'd, the intricacies cleared, the errors rectified, and the method amended, it might well pass for an excellent Grammar&#146;  (J. Kirkwood, <span class="italic">The History of the Twenty Seven Gods of Linlithgow</span>, 1711, iii). At the commissioners' direction he published <span class="italic">Grammatica Despauteriana, cum nova novi generis glossa: cui subjunguntur singula primae partis exempla vernacula reddita</span> (1695). This went to further editions in 1700, 1711, and 1720, though by that time it had been superseded by Thomas Ruddiman's <span class="italic">Rudiments of the Latin Tongue</span> (1714). Kirkwood had died by the time of the fourth edition, in 1720, although details of the exact date and place of his death are unknown.<br>
