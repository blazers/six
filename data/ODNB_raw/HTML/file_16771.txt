<span class="headword">Liston, Sir  Robert</span>  (1742&#150;1836), <span class="occ">tutor and diplomat</span>, was born at Overtoun, Kirkliston, Linlithgowshire, on 8 October 1742, the second, and oldest surviving, son of Patrick Liston of Torbanehill (<i>d</i>. 1749) and Christian Dick (<i>d</i>. 1790). He studied for the Church of Scotland at Edinburgh University, but then was offered the post of private tutor to the sons of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Stobs. He was expected to &#145;perfect himself in classics, law and dancing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 1.91) before accompanying the boys&#151;Gilbert, aged twelve, afterwards first earl of Minto, and Hugh, aged ten&#151;to Paris in 1763. There he directed their studies under the general supervision of the historian David Hume, who introduced him to the retired actress Marie-Jeanne Riccoboni. Liston submitted a continuous record of activities and expenses to Elliot, which gives an insight into the life and upbringing abroad of the two young Scottish gentlemen. In 1772 he assisted Gilbert Stuart on the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, contributing letters compiled from the journals of his own travels, mainly in France. Between 1766 and 1782 he maintained a lively and, certainly on her side, intimate correspondence (eighty-three of her letters to &#145;mon cher Bob&#146; survive) with Madame Riccoboni, who was thirty years his senior. The letters remain together among his papers in the National Library of Scotland.<br>
<br>When Hugh Elliot adopted a diplomatic career Liston became his private secretary, and accompanied him on missions to Munich, Regensburg, and Berlin. In March 1783 Lord Mountstewart, later first marquess of Bute, was sent to Madrid as ambassador-extraordinary, and appointed Liston as secretary to the embassy. This, at forty-one years old, was his first diplomatic appointment. He acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires in Mountstewart's absence, and succeeded him as minister-plenipotentiary at Madrid for five years. In May 1785 he was made LLD Edinburgh. From August 1788 to May 1793 he served as envoy-extraordinary at Stockholm. In 1793 he was appointed to the once lucrative position of ambassador-extraordinary to the prestigious embassy of the Sublime Porte in Constantinople during the reign of Selim III. He travelled overland with Dr John Sibthorp among others, and served there just three years. At a time of decreasing trade with the Levant Company (which paid most of his salary) Liston believed that the British in the Ottoman states &#145;flouted Ottoman sovreignty at every turn&#146;  (Cunningham, 85). In February 1796 he was appointed British minister to the United States of America, only thirteen years after the ending of the American War of Independence. On 27 February 1796 he married Henrietta [<a name="cosubject_57469"></a><span class="headword">Henrietta Liston</span>, Lady Liston  (1751&#150;1828)], <span class="occ">botanist</span>, daughter of Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. 1761) and Sarah Marchant of Antigua, at the episcopal chapel, Glasgow; they had no children.<br>
<br>Liston was not eager to accept this post at a crucial period in British&#150;American relations, with the heavy responsibility it carried of &#145;clearing up the debris left behind in 1783: Indian affairs, debt questions and boundary issues&#146;  (Wright, 123). He remained at Philadelphia until December 1800, and, through his actions, the British government agreed that Britain would not intervene in west or south-west America. He acted skilfully as an intermediary between the Canadian and American governments about the upper Mississippi valley, and did much to encourage the informal system whereby Royal Navy ships convoyed American merchantmen. When he handed over, &#145;British-American relations were much more cordial than anyone might have foreseen five years earlier&#146;  (Wright, 127). Henrietta Liston wrote frequent frank letters home, reporting knowledgeably on life and politics in America. Her letters tell of housekeeping, Liston's observation that the planned site for Washington strongly resembled Constantinople, George Washington's favourite occupation of farming, the social life in Philadelphia, freedom of speech, and visiting Niagara Falls.<br>
<br>Liston was next appointed envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Batavian republic. He arrived in The Hague in September 1802, but in June 1803 left on a mission to Copenhagen until May 1804. Then, at the age of sixty-two, he retired on a pension. The Listons built Millburn Tower near Edinburgh. Henrietta Liston created an American garden, and introduced plants from America and the West Indies and later from Constantinople. In 1811, after the renewal of diplomatic relations with Turkey, Liston was reappointed to Constantinople, taking over from Stratford Canning, who had been acting in the senior post for some time. The Listons were accompanied by a large embassy, including Brigadier-General Sir Robert Wilson (as special military commissioner), Bartholomew Frere, and William Turner. Wilson's diary of their journey (BL, Add. MS 30100) was published as the <span class="italic">Private Diary of Sir Robert Wilson</span> in 1861. The mission in Constantinople started unfavourably for, since the treaty of Bucharest, the Turks were &#145;in a state of &hellip; extreme ill-humour with England for having <i>advised</i> the conciliation of the treaty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Diary</span>, 1.395). However, over the years, relations improved, and Liston departed before the start of the Greek War of Independence.<br>
<br>Liston is notable as one of only three commoners to hold the highest diplomatic office at this time. He was sworn of the privy council in 1812, and made GCB (civil) in 1816. He finally retired on a pension at the age of seventy-nine. He died at his residence, Millburn Tower, on 15 July 1836, at the age of ninety-three. He was an accomplished linguist in ten languages. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> recorded that he was &#145;the father of the diplomatic body throughout Europe&#146;. An American admirer summed him up as &#145;sensible&#151;pleasant&#151;easy&#151;an agreeable man&#146;  (Cowan, 190). His wife, Henrietta, had died in 1828, probably at Millburn Tower. Apart from her letters home from their diplomatic appointments, she took a keen interest in botany and collected specimens for Sir Joseph Banks. Sir Robert and Lady Liston were buried near each other in Gogar churchyard.<br>
