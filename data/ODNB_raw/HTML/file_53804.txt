<span class="headword">Downing,  Joseph</span>  (1676&#150;1734), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was born into a family of London printers, the second of four sons of William and Ann Downing. He learned his trade in the family printing shop in Bartholomew Close, near West Smithfield, and took over responsibility for the business on his father's death. Shortly afterwards Downing became free of the Stationers' Company by patrimony, and by 1705 he was binding apprentices in his own right. He took the company's livery in 1706 and held minor office in 1713&#150;14, but never became a member of the court. From 1703 Downing was closely associated with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), later also with the Society for Propagating the Gospel. The former, founded in 1698, had as one of its major aims the dissemination of devotional literature among sections of the population that were losing a formal connection with the church. The association with the SPCK enabled Downing to build up a substantial business, specializing in printing and distributing large quantities of cheap, improving tracts intended to be read by a wide and increasingly literate public.<br>
<br>Downing was not the society's servant. His imprint (unlike those of his successors) does not refer to the SPCK directly, nor do his catalogues make explicit reference to the connection between the titles listed and the society. Although the society distributed only those it selected, publication was probably regarded by Downing almost as having its imprimatur. This explains incidents such as that in December 1703, when Downing was reprimanded by the society's committee for printing a translation from the French that contained &#145;many dangerous points&#146;  (Jefcoate, 321). After this the minutes of the twice-monthly SPCK committee meetings record relatively few signs of dissatisfaction with their printer, though they occasionally sought to advise him on matters such as appropriate binders or advertising. He rarely appeared before the committee in person, often sending a representative if requested to do so. As membership changed with time, the committee sought to establish the society's precise relationship with Downing. On occasion, he was obliged to renounce his right in the society's titles printed by him. Nevertheless, the connection continued, apparently to mutual benefit, for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Downing's achievement was to develop a profitable business in a specialist area of the book trade at a time when the spread of literacy was creating a market for such material. This was based on the printing of large quantities of a relatively small number of tracts on social topics of particular concern to SPCK members&#151;for example swearing, drunkenness, uncleanness, lying, and breaches of the Lord's day. Some were intended for specific groups, such as prisoners, soldiers, or even London boatmen. Downing's interest in spreading literacy took practical expression with his own published <span class="italic">Proposal for Teaching Poor Children to Read</span>, in which he calculates that a child could be taught to read for an investment of only 10<i>s</i>. He was a trustee of London charity schools, and left &pound;50 to the charity school of his own parish.<br>
<br>A catalogue issued in 1707 (wholly revised in 1708) was addressed to &#145;all pious and charitable persons (especially as live in the country) who are religiously disposed to give any number of [books] to their friends, dependents, or others&#146;  (Jefcoate, 322). Prices are supplied for books singly or &#145;by the hundred &amp;c.&#146; Items could be selected to make up parcels of improving tracts on a range of subjects. Nevertheless, Downing's publishing activities were not restricted entirely to mass markets for cheap print, as his long connection with the German pastor Anton Wilhelm B&ouml;hm (1673&#150;1722) demonstrates. This enabled the distribution in the English-speaking world of translations and adaptations of many of the key texts of Lutheran pietism. In addition Downing printed B&ouml;hm's sermons and other works for London's own Lutheran parishes, some of the first examples of printing in London in the German vernacular. Downing died in 1734, after which the business (and SPCK connection) was continued by his widow, Martha, of whom further details are unknown.<br>
