<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  James, of Hopetoun</span>, appointed Lord Hopetoun under the protectorate  (1614&#150;1661), <span class="occ">industrialist and political radical</span>, was born on 4 July 1614, the youngest of six sons (of whom four survived to adulthood) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13736/', "Sir Thomas Hope")</script> of Craighall, lord advocate (1573&#150;1646), and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of John Bennet of Wallyford, Haddingtonshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13728/', "Sir John Hope")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13735/', "Sir Thomas Hope")</script> of Kerse were his brothers. Entering Edinburgh University in 1632, he graduated on 25 July 1635 and continued his studies in law at Orl&eacute;ans from February 1636 to October 1637. On 14 January 1638 he married Anna (<i>d</i>. 1656), daughter of the wealthy Edinburgh merchant and goldsmith Robert Foulis, an heiress through whom he acquired several mining properties in Lanarkshire commonly known as the Leadhills. Hope's mercantile concerns were extensive. He had an abiding interest in mining, trade, shipping, and technology, in many ways anticipating the improvers of the eighteenth century: extensive material survives at Hopetoun House detailing his business interests, including contracts (usually to supply lead ore to Holland), bonds, directives to his factors about building and draining mines, mending the highway leading from the mines to port, and a strikingly wide range of titles, assignations, discharges, translations, declarations, and investments. Given his expertise in metals and technology, it is hardly surprising that the covenanting government appointed him master of the mint in 1641. That year he was also knighted.<br>
<br>Like his father and most of his brothers, Hope was deeply religious and an active participant in the covenanting revolution, but by the late 1640s an apocalyptic spirituality led him and his elder brother John to expectations of far-reaching reform. Both eventually became republicans and ardent supporters of the British Commonwealth that emerged in 1652. James Hope has the unique distinction of being part of what can only be called the &#145;left opposition&#146; in the most radical parliament in Scottish history (the Whiggamores Parliament of 1649) where he became <i>persona non grata</i>, and shortly thereafter a member of the &#145;left opposition&#146; within the most radical parliament in English history (Barebone's Parliament of 1653), from which he was ejected at gunpoint. In both parliaments he served on the centrally important law reform committees. He was directly involved in the administration of the state in both countries, serving on the committee of estates in Scotland, on the council of state in England.<br>
<br>Between 1649 and 1651 both Hopes opposed Scotland's treaty with Charles II, foreseeing rightly that it would lead to a disastrous war with the new English republic. They repeatedly urged the marquess of Argyll and Charles to come to terms with the London government, proposals that very nearly landed the brothers in gaol. Argyll denounced Hope as &#145;a maine enemie to king and kingdom&#146; and a &#145;plotter and contriver, assister and abettor of all the mischiefs that hes befallen the kingdom&#146;, while Charles subsequently threatened to hang the brothers from the other end of the same rope by which he would hang Oliver Cromwell  (<span class="italic">Historical Works of Balfour</span>, 4.173).<br>
<br>It is against this background of self-deception and the political catastrophe deriving from it, that in late December 1651 Hope and John Swinton of Swinton agreed to join John Hope at Craighall, his home in Fife, to consider a new beginning for Scotland. On 1 January 1652 they were joined by major-generals John Lambert and Richard Deane and other leading English officers for &#145;consultations about politique affairs&#146;. It is unfortunate and yet not altogether surprising that the extensive entry in Hope's diary about the Craighall meeting has been mutilated, but it is likely that the matters discussed ranged from the practical (the surrender of Dumbarton Castle which was commanded by Hope's brother-in-law Sir Charles Erskine of Alvath), to the establishment of a new structure of government within Scotland, the tender for union, and the larger aspirations and apocalyptic hopes which all of these people shared  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Commonwealth</span>, 30, 43).<br>
<br>In May 1653 Hope joined his brother on the commission of justice for Scotland&#151;the republic's equivalent to the court of session, the members of which were addressed in the manner of the lords of session. Cromwell, who had met Hope during the Scottish campaign, also wanted him in the new &#145;British&#146; assembly which would now replace the Long Parliament. Hope arrived in London just in time for its opening on 4 July. Shortly thereafter he made what has been described as a &#145;speech for the Jews&#146;&#151;undoubtedly a plea for Jewish readmission into the newly emerging Britain. His remarks clearly spoke to the universal reconciliation expected at the &#145;end of days&#146; and provide an indication of his apocalyptic hopes. Such a speech fitted the mood in Barebone's Parliament and must have shared much with Cromwell's well-known and highly prophetic address to it. It is not surprising then that Hope joined the council of state ten days later. The only Scot on the council and with unique legal expertise, he served, effectively, as the secretary of state for Scotland.<br>
<br>In addition to serving on the controversial committee to codify the law, Hope was extremely active in a broad spectrum of the Commonwealth's administrative matters, ranging from military supply to censorship, mental health, legal procedures, and specialist Scottish business. He and his three Scottish colleagues were inevitably concerned to introduce emergency measures to repair the shattered Scottish economy and &#145;the destitute conditione&#146; of the Scottish people  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>). In all of this there was the central preoccupation of a new Scotland within a new world, and an act of union would naturally be all important. Inescapably, the debates about the Anglo-Scottish union would be protracted and complex, and, as he noted to Erskine on 24 September, he did not expect a bill to emerge before December, if then  (Erskine-Murray MSS, 5155, fol. 151). Such devotion to duty went well beyond the standards of seventeenth-century parliaments; like more radical members (and in contrast to traditional attitudes), Hope appears to have viewed his office as a public trust rather than as property.<br>
<br>Similarly Hope appears to have associated himself consistently with far-reaching reform: he was personally and presumably politically attracted to the Kent radical Thomas St Nicholas. On 1 November 1653 both failed to secure re-election to the council as a result of their radicalism. In the parliament's famous final division, the Scottish votes made the difference (three radicals, one conservative), a circumstance which inevitably provoked considerable comment. In contrast with that of his three colleagues, the forcible dissolution of parliament forever ended Hope's public career. He apparently had a confrontation with Cromwell on the matter, so spectacular that he was immediately disgraced and discharged from all public office. As he commented in a private petition to the protector two years later, he had hoped to find &#145;in my private statione a hydeing place untill the indignation should be overpast&#146;  (Hopetoun House, Linlithgow MSS, bundle 648). More important, as with so many people in Britain, the failure of this parliament had cooled his prophetic vision and qualified his hopes: incremental improvement, not revolution; &#145;present dispensations&#146;, not a new heaven, a new earth. Probably as much as anyone Hope embodies the disappointments and transvaluations of the &#145;British revolution&#146;. He now focused his formidable energies into commercial and industrial activity, and his concern with government was limited to personal matters: securing his family's traditional immunities from lead ore export duties and acquiring government support for new mining ventures. Mineral discoveries at home might compensate for the failure of the republic's &#145;Western Design&#146; at Hispaniola.<br>
<br>Hope was a respected and apparently a genuinely likeable man&#151;even Cromwell continued to like him. His old colleague John Swinton let him know in 1657 that no less a figure than Major-General Lambert had regretted his removal from public office. Not surprisingly, Hope's name came up from time to time as a possible appointment to the Scottish commission&#151;only to be specifically rejected in 1655 by the president of the new Scottish council, the conservative Lord Broghill. By this time Hope avowed he had &#145;no scruple to serve under this or any other power whatsoever in such publict imployments&#146;, an outlook a long way from his earlier stance. Regarded by English republicans as &#145;a knowne Commonwealthes man&#146;, in March 1660 Hope was at last appointed once again to the commission, but neither he nor his fellow appointees ever actually served the rapidly disintegrating regime  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Protectorate</span>, 385).<br>
<br>His first wife having died in 1656, Hope had married on 29 October 1657 Lady Mary, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15278/', "William Keith, sixth Earl Marischal")</script>. On 23 November 1661 he died at the Granton home of his elder brother Alexander from a fever contracted during a trip to Holland, and was buried at Cramond church. His second wife survived him, and his son John (1650&#150;1682) succeeded to the Hopetoun estate.<br>
