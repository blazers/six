<span class="headword">Ward <span class="st"> [Warde]</span>,  William</span>  (1534&#150;1609), <span class="occ">physician and translator</span>, was born at Landbeach, Cambridgeshire, in 1534. He was educated at Eton College, and then was elected a scholar at King's College, Cambridge, on 13 August 1550. On 14 August 1553 he became a fellow. He graduated BA in 1555 and proceeded MA in 1558. On 27 February 1552 the provost of his college requested him to take up the study of medicine, and he became MD in 1567. In 1568 he left his fellowship. His name is attached to the petition signed in 1572 against the new statutes of the university which allowed students to begin their medical training without first undertaking preliminary training in the arts. Ward became regius professor of physic at Cambridge in succession to Thomas Lorkin, who died in 1591. It is probably through his official post at Cambridge that Ward is spoken of as physician to Elizabeth I and James I. Ward was married twice: first, on 26 January 1568, to Margaret Fletcher; second, on 10 February 1584, to Jane Bosom, both times at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge. He had at least three sons, William, Thomas, and Roger.<br>
<br>Ward was translator of <span class="italic">The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis Piemont: Containing Excellent Remedies Against Divers Diseases and other Accidents</span>. The first edition was published in 1558 containing only the first part, and consisting of six books. Another two editions were printed in 1559 and contain a dedicatory letter by Ward to the earl of Bedford, notable for its protest against the folly of &#145;some curious Christians among us nowadays &hellip; which most impudently despise all manner of medicines&#146;, and for its defence of the &#145;heavenly science&#146; of physic. Ward mentions Christopher Plantin's edition of a French translation (Antwerp, 1557) as his original. The work became very popular as a treasury of medical and other knowledge in all the countries of Europe. The identity of Alessio of Piedmont has not been satisfactorily settled. Of this first part numerous editions were published in England. It occurs usually bound up with <span class="italic">The Seconde Parte of the Secrets of Maister Alexis of Piemont</span>, again translated by Ward and published in 1560 and 1563. <span class="italic">The Thyrde and Last Parte of the Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piemont</span> translated by Ward appeared first in 1562. It contains six books, like the first part. Here his work seems to have ended but in many copies of the book a fourth and fifth part are added, translated by R. Androse.<br>
<br>Ward was the translator of other works from French into English: <span class="italic">Thre notable sermones made by the godly and famous clerke, Maister John Calvyn, on thre severall Sondayes in Maye, the yere 1561, upon the Psalm 46. &hellip; Englished by William Warde</span> was published in 1562, while <span class="italic">The most excellent, profitable, and pleasaunt booke of the famous doctor and expert astrologian Arcandam or Aleandrin</span> appeared in 1578 and was sufficiently popular to be reprinted another four times by 1670. Based on an elaborate calculation of the numerical value of letters in a person's name, it was derived from the &#145;spheres of life and death&#146;, and was of a type that went back to the ancient world. It was a work translated into Latin from &#145;a confused and indistinct&#146; original by Richard Roussat, <i>canonicus Lingoniensis</i>, and published at Paris in 1542. There is also a copy of Latin verses by Ward before James Robothum's <span class="italic">Pleausaunt and Wittie Playe of the Cheastes</span> (chess), published in 1562, which Ward may have translated from the French.<br>
<br>William Ward died in 1609 and was buried at Great St Mary's, Cambridge, on 8 August. In 1590 he had given to the same parish 7&frac12; acres of arable land in Howsfield and 2 acres of meadowland in Chesterton.<br>
