<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bain,  Alexander</span>  (1818&#150;1903), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, was born on 11 June 1818, the second child of eight of George Bain, an impoverished Calvinist weaver of Aberdeen, and his wife, Margaret Paul. Bain left school at the age of eleven but, via evening classes at the mechanics' institute and adolescent autodidactic labours, he gained entrance to Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1836, graduating joint top in 1840, his course comprising classics, mathematics, science, and philosophy. A lifelong religious scepticism dated from this period. Until 1845 he remained at Marischal College as assistant in moral philosophy (1841&#150;4) and teacher of natural philosophy (1844&#150;5), but applications for the chairs of natural philosophy and moral philosophy failed through objections to his religious views. A year as Andersonian professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Anderson's University, Glasgow, followed (1845&#150;6), but his progress was still hampered on religious grounds, and he moved to London to take up the post of assistant secretary under Edwin Chadwick at the metropolitan sanitary commission of the Board of Health. Drawn into London's radical intellectual circles, his horizons now broadened. This group included Herbert Spencer, G. H. Lewes, Thomas Carlyle, George and John Grote, Harriet Martineau, George Eliot, and J. S. Mill, whose influence was especially significant; Bain subsequently collaborated with J. S. Mill in editing his father's, James Mill's, <span class="italic">Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind</span> (1873), and in 1882 he published <span class="italic">James Mill: a Biography</span> and <span class="italic">John Stuart Mill: a Criticism with Personal Recollections</span>. Bain began publishing articles in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> in 1840 and contributed to various popular educational series issued by the Edinburgh publisher, Chambers. During these years of struggle up to 1860 there was little upon which Bain declined to write&#151;the physical sciences, the Greeks, travel, and town water supplies being among the topics receiving his attention (though he rejected George Eliot's request for a review of Auguste Comte).<br>
<br>In 1851 Bain resumed his academic career at the all-women Bedford College, London, where he lectured on moral science and geography until 1854. During 1854 he visited Paris, meeting Comte, with whom he was deeply unimpressed. By contrast, F. Longet's <span class="italic">Anatomie et physiologie</span> largely inspired Bain's final approach in <span class="italic">The Senses and the Intellect</span> (1855, a project initiated in 1848) and it was during this period that he prepared this and the companion, <span class="italic">The Emotions and the Will</span> (1859), which were his most influential works. In 1855 he married Frances Anne Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 1892) and in 1856 spent the summer in Germany. He obtained an examinership in the University of London (1857&#150;63) and became examiner in moral science for the Indian Civil Service (1858&#150;70). In 1860 he finally obtained the chair of logic at the University of Aberdeen (following unification of the older King's and Marischal colleges); he was backed by the home secretary, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, against the wishes of the principal, Colin Campbell (who preferred James McCosh), and fellow cabinet member, the duke of Argyll. Bain's teaching duties included English grammar and rhetoric along with mental and moral philosophy.<br>
<br>Bain's reputation rests primarily on his being one of the founders of modern psychology, most crucially by virtue of <span class="italic">The Senses and the Intellect</span> and <span class="italic">The Emotions and the Will</span> (posterity's verdict on <span class="italic">The Study of Character with an Estimate of Phrenology</span>, 1861, being universally uncharitable). Revised editions of these continued in use as textbooks in both Britain and the USA into the 1890s. Alongside these, his founding, in 1876, and funding and editorship, until 1892, of the journal, <span class="italic">Mind</span>, was of considerable significance for psychology's emergence as a formal discipline, providing the primary English language forum for psychological papers until the appearance of more specialist journals in the USA in the 1890s (<span class="italic">Mind</span> becoming devoted to philosophy thereafter). Bain himself contributed numerous papers and notes until 1894 (many of which were later reprinted in the <span class="italic">Dissertations on Leading Philosophical Topics</span>, 1903).<br>
<br>Bain's psychological work was novel in several respects. Most obviously, his approach appeared to transform philosophical questions into empirical &#145;scientific&#146; ones. While elements of the Scottish realist tradition of Thomas Reid, whom he &#145;read over again and again&#146;  (Bain, 234) in the early 1850s, and Dugald Stewart continued to lurk, under J. S. Mill's influence Bain substantially converted to the rival doctrine of associationism. Unlike Mill, however, he wished to found his account on the latest empirical scientific findings, emanating primarily from physiology. (An earlier interest in phrenology had been a harbinger of this orientation.) Essentially his method was to provide a systematic, natural history type of classification of mental states on the basis of the associative mechanisms by which they were lawfully generated. The works resulting from this fusion of associationist theory, physiology, and natural historical method thus bore a fundamentally scientific rather than philosophical character, linking associative mental processes with available knowledge of the nervous system and cerebral functioning. Thus, in learning, the establishment of habits was understood as involving the creation and progressive strengthening of relevant nerve pathways in the brain. Despite being associationist, Bain's account was less passive than those in earlier philosophical versions of this doctrine, the organism being understood as actively striving to make sense of the world, although he proposed nothing as distinct as an ego or self underlying this. Rather than simple, passive associations it was the capacity for active discrimination which constituted the core psychological process. The nervous system was spontaneously active, rather than merely reactive, and Bain's treatment of the role of spontaneous movements in facilitating the development of voluntary behaviour of an increasingly discriminative kind adumbrates modern notions of feedback loops. In adopting this perspective Bain was among the first major writers to incorporate the &#145;energy&#146; concept fully into psychological theorizing and to insist on the firm physiological grounding of all psychological phenomena. While it is routine to credit pioneers with anticipating future developments in their fields, Bain managed this to a remarkable degree which only began to be appreciated from about 1980. Most classic theories of the child's cognitive development (including James Mark Baldwin's, Alfred Binet's, and Jean Piaget's) had important roots in Bain's analysis. His account of habit constituted the point of departure for William James's subsequent treatment of the topic and American learning theory generally (anticipating what E. B. Thorndike called the &#145;law of effect&#146; for example, and introducing the notion of trial and error learning&#151;although he used this rather more broadly than later learning theorists to cover rational as well as random learning). Moreover, C. S. Peirce, founder of the American philosophical school of pragmatism, took his lead from Bain's view of belief as &#145;that upon which a man is prepared to act&#146;.<br>
<br>Bain always stressed psychology's practical importance, particularly for education (notably in <span class="italic">Education as a Science</span>, 1878), and continued publishing works attacking metaphysical idealism (for example, <span class="italic">Mind and Body: the Theories of their Relation</span>, 1872) and promoting the new discipline, most successfully in <span class="italic">Mental and Moral Science: a Compendium of Psychology and Ethics</span> (1868), as well as in <span class="italic">Logic</span> (1870). His educational concerns yielded the two-volume <span class="italic">English Composition and Rhetoric</span> (1867, enlarged 1887) and works on English grammar. His concern with social issues and the applicability of psychology resulted in a further set of anticipations of later disciplinary interests in social norms, occupational psychology, testing, and training, although he never ventured into quantitative psychometrics.<br>
<br>Although psychological rather than philosophical, Bain's system was transitional in two fundamental respects: first, while empirical and physiologically based it remained non-experimental, observational (often introspectionist), and descriptive (unlike contemporary developments in Germany initiated by W. Wundt and G. T. Fechner); second, Bain never fully assimilated the evolutionary vision which provided the unifying theoretical framework within which psychology first crystallized as a scientific discipline after 1870. Regarding the latter, this ironically helped the early success of his books <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Herbert Spencer's rival <span class="italic">Principles of Psychology</span> (1855), the thoroughgoing evolutionism of which many initially found unacceptably radical. While he increasingly ascribed a role to heredity, his explanatory mode remained that of identifying the &#145;bottom-up&#146; assembly of associative connections and discriminations rather than evolutionary functionalism.<br>
<br>Traditionally, historians of psychology located Bain firmly in the associationist camp, but this probably underestimates how far his thinking, especially in the 1850s and 1860s, continued to be influenced by his native Scottish realist philosophical background, and in 1860&#150;61 he was still publishing papers sympathetic to phrenology in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. While abandoning Scottish realism's cruder &#145;faculty&#146; analysis, his own fourfold classification of mental phenomena continued to bear a formal resemblance to this, as the very titles of his two major works indicate, even if he viewed them as dynamically interrelated segments of a single energy distribution process rather than distinct sets of powers.<br>
<br>Besides his own work Bain edited <span class="italic">The Moral Philosophy of Paley</span> (1852), G. Grote's <span class="italic">Aristotle</span> (1872), and G. Croom Robertson's philosophical remains (1894). He received an honorary LLD from the University of Edinburgh (1869) and a civil-list pension of &pound;100 after 1895. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> entry's assessment of his writings as &#145;lucid&#146; would now receive little assent and if conceding his &#145;exceptional gift of methodical exposition&#146; most would consider this a euphemistic way of putting it. Probably reflecting readers' reactions more accurately, E. Valentine, in the <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Psychology</span>, describes his style as &#145;ponderous, verbose and lengthy&#146;.<br>
<br>Bain's work was frostily received by pious Scottish academics and the equally pious American mental and moral philosophers who dominated psychology teaching in the USA until the late 1880s. Yale's president, Noah Porter, attacked his &#145;cerebral&#146; approach vehemently in <span class="italic">The Sciences of Nature versus the Science of Man</span> of 1871 (although he was sympathetic to the German experimentalists who, as he saw it, eschewed Bain's physiological reductionism). In the intellectual context of American-Scottish mental and moral philosophy Bain's was a particularly irritating presence, not least since he was both a native and based in the heartland of that tradition&#151;Thomas Reid himself having been a professor of philosophy at Aberdeen.<br>
<br>After retiring from his chair at Aberdeen in 1880 Bain remained active and was twice elected lord rector of the university, defeating Lord Randolph Churchill on the second occasion. In 1892 he presented a paper on the relationship between introspective and psychophysical experimental methods at the Second International Congress of Experimental Psychology in London. Following his wife's death that year, he married Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1858/9), daughter of John Forbes, sheriff clerk of Banffshire, and his wife, Eliza Young, in a civil ceremony on 14 April 1893. There were no children from either marriage. Bain's health failing, in 1895 he withdrew from the strenuous public life he had so long enjoyed. This had extended to widespread popular lecturing and support for causes such as public libraries and mechanics' institutes. Any image of Bain's personality is now dourly dominated by his daunting capacity for hard work, as a writer, scholar, editor, administrator, committee man, and propagandist for the cause of education. This edifice should not obscure the extent to which he was also a genuinely creative and doggedly independent thinker, and one held in much affection by his contemporaries, many of whom benefited directly from his support. In 1896 his health suffered a temporary breakdown, probably from influenza; however, he resumed work on recasting the curriculi of Aberdeen University and promoting the extension of Marischal College buildings. He had revisited Paris in 1876 (meeting Th&eacute;odule Ribot) and Germany (1885), where he met Wundt, H. Helmholtz, H. Ebbinghaus, E. Haeckel, E. Du Bois-Reymond, and the young American psychologist James McKeen Cattell (who acted as interpreter in his encounter with Wundt). Bain died at his home, Ferryhill Lodge, Polmuir Road, Aberdeen, on 18 September 1903, survived by his second wife. He was buried in Aberdeen. His <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> appeared posthumously in 1904.<br>
