<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Webb,  Matthew</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Captain Webb]</span>  (1848&#150;1883), <span class="occ">swimmer</span>, was born on 18 January 1848 at Dawley, Shropshire, one of a family of twelve children of Matthew Webb (1813&#150;1876), a country doctor, and his wife, Sarah. By the age of eight he had learned to swim in the River Severn below Ironbridge, and shortly afterwards he saved the life of his younger brother, who almost drowned when attempting to swim across the river. At the age of twelve, inspired by W. H. G. Kingston's sea tale <span class="italic">Old Jack</span>, he joined the mercantile training ship <i>Conway</i> in the Mersey. Another cadet there remarked of Webb: &#145;We thought very little of him as a swimmer, but admired his staying powers. He could swim for an hour without putting his foot to the floor, though in a race he was nowhere&#146;  (Elderwick, 8). His first opponent was a Newfoundland dog, whose master boasted of its extraordinary stamina in the water. Webb backed himself against it. He continued floating happily in a choppy sea for over an hour until the dog swam exhausted back to its master's boat.<br>
<br>Webb then entered the merchant navy, where he made his mark and displayed his contempt for danger with some resolute and lone swims in various parts of the world. He submerged into the Suez Canal to release some hawsers, recovered off Natal some wrecked cargo in heavy surf, and dived through huge waves in the Atlantic in a forlorn attempt to rescue a passenger, for which he was awarded the first Stanhope gold medal in 1874. By this time he had grown into a man of herculean build, with a wrestler's body that was particularly strong &#145;in the loins and legs&#146;.<br>
<br>Early in 1875 Webb was briefly captain of the <i>Emerald of Liverpool</i>. A newspaper report of an unsuccessful attempt to swim the English Channel prompted him to abandon the navy and concentrate on swimming it himself. No one had ever succeeded and it was generally considered impossible at the time. Webb trained solidly along the south coast while the journalist Robert Patrick Watson, who accompanied him in a small boat, grew tired of watching his &#145;slow, methodical, but perfect, breaststroke, and the magnificent sweep of his ponderous legs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Robert Patrick Watson</span>, 1899, 113). On 12 August 1875 he made his first attempt, but rough seas forced him to give up at midnight when over half-way there, in consideration not for himself but for those in the boat, as the waves were pouring over the sides.<br>
<br>Twelve days later Webb tried again. At 1 p.m. he dived off the Admiralty pier, Dover, wearing a red silk costume. He kept up a slow and steady pace. The crew of a French steamer came up on deck and gazed in astonishment. When the <i>Maid of Kent</i> passed by at night, the passengers cheered as a red light was held over the stern to enable them to watch the swimmer. They roared him on with some verses of &#145;Rule Britannia&#146;. Seven miles from the French coast the tide changed and he seemed to be driven backwards, but eventually he landed after twenty-two hours in the water. The varying currents had forced him to swim over 40 miles. He quickly recovered, however, and merely felt a peculiar sensation in his limbs &#145;similar to that after the first day of the cricket season&#146;.<br>
<br>Webb's triumphant return to London brought business to a close at the stock exchange, and bonfires illuminated the valleys of his native Shropshire. He then embarked on a lecture tour round the country, but he never made much money, and had the reputation of being generous to a fault. Poverty forced him to return to swimming. He took part in endurance races, and sailed to America to challenge Boynton, a coastguard who had &#145;swum&#146; the channel before him, albeit equipped with a rubber suit and paddle. Although Boynton retained this equipment for the race, Webb still won. On his return to England Webb floated for up to sixty hours in various tanks in front of queuing spectators, but a race with a Dr Jennings at Hollingworth Lake, Lancashire, on 1 October 1881, marked the turning point of his career. After it, Webb was so exhausted that he could hardly be pulled from the water. &#145;His career from now on had a downward tendency&#146;, wrote Watson. &#145;He had almost played his last card&#146;  (Elderwick, 97).<br>
<br>Once again Webb was almost destitute, and he now had a young family to provide for, having married Madeleine Kate Chaddock on 27 April 1880. As a final gesture he resolved to swim downriver below the Niagara Falls, perhaps the most dangerous stretch of water in the world. Three miles below the falls the river rushes violently down a narrow gorge into a deep depression in the cliffside. On emerging from the depression it forms a whirlpool a quarter of a mile wide, surrounded by jagged rocks. Webb was warned by his friends and doctors that he was no longer in his prime, but it was evidently a topic he chose to avoid. Above all, he dreaded a quiet life.<br>
<br>Webb sailed to America in 1883 with his wife, son, and daughter of seven months. He spent some days training off Nantucket beach, while his family remained ignorant of his intentions, then travelled alone to Niagara. He reckoned $10,000 was at stake. The date was fixed for 21 July, but was postponed to enable railway companies to expand their travel arrangements: over ten thousand spectators were expected. At 4 p.m. on 24 July Webb was rowed out into midstream. He dived into the river and was instantly gripped by the force of the current. He was seen heading for the whirlpool, then abruptly he threw up his arms and was drawn under. His last words to the boatman had been: &#145;If I die, they will do something for my wife&#146;  (Williams, 8). Some days later his body was found by fishermen. His skull had been cracked by the submarine rocks around the whirlpool, and the red silk costume that he had worn for his channel swim was torn to shreds. He was buried in the Oakwood cemetery at the edge of the falls, in a heart-shaped plot of ground known as the Stranger's Rest.<br>
