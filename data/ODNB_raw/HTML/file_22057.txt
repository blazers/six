<span class="headword">Pett,  Peter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1589), <span class="occ">shipwright</span>, was the son of Peter Pett of Harwich, Essex (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1554) and Elizabeth Paynter. The details of his life until his appointment as a royal shipwright, from Michaelmas 1543, at a fee of 6<i>d</i>. per day for life &#145;in consideration of good and faithful service done and to be done&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Phineas Pett</span>, xxi) are unknown. However, he may just have been the boy of the same name who was swept up in a press of East Anglian shipwrights in 1523 to work at Portsmouth. In April 1558 he was granted a patent advancing his fee to 1<i>s</i>. per day, which he surrendered in July 1582 for a new patent giving him the title of master shipwright for the first time.<br>
<br>Pett trained Richard Chapman, and probably also Matthew Baker, both of whom eventually joined him as the principal royal master shipwrights. Practically all the important shipbuilding of Elizabeth's reign was carried out by this triumvirate, and it is difficult to establish individual responsibility for the construction of particular vessels. William Borough, comptroller of the navy, held the opinion that, of the three, Baker built the better ships. In 1579 bargains were made between the queen and Sir John Hawkins, treasurer of the navy, and with Pett and Baker, for maintaining twenty-five named vessels in a seaworthy condition. Pett and Baker were to have &pound;1000 a year between them, for which they were regularly to service ships' hulls, repair or replace defective upper spars and masts, provide all materials, and pay the workers. Perhaps in expectation of enhanced status from this arrangement, Pett obtained a grant of arms in 1583, but Hawkins's enforcement of the contract to his own advantage severely reduced the anticipated profit to Pett and Baker. In January 1588 they accused the treasurer of dishonesty. These charges seem not to have damaged Hawkins, nor indeed to have affected the positions of Pett or Baker, both of whom continued in their posts.<br>
<br>Faced with the Armada threat of 1588, the earl of Leicester called Pett to advise on the construction of a defensive barrier across the Thames between Tilbury and Gravesend to prevent Spanish ships reaching London. Pett inspected the site with Leicester on 23 July, and was not impressed by the proposed boom constructed from lighters chained together. He recommended that this should be strengthened with a number of ship's masts, which he would have sent down from Deptford. Leicester reported to Walsingham that the fort at Tilbury was lacking gun platforms, and that Pett had been sent &#145;for provision of such thinges as are most necessary for the platforms, as also touching the defence uppon this water&#146;. That Pett discharged this mission is confirmed by a warrant dated 15 August 1588, ordering the payment of &pound;150 to him, Matthew Baker, and Richard Chapman &#145;or any of them&#146; towards charges incurred at Gravesend and Tilbury, pending detailed examination of their accounts  (Cruden, 237, 247).<br>
<br>Peter Pett married twice. Nothing is known of his first wife, but they had at least five children, of whom William (<i>d</i>. 1587), Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1605), and Peter (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1631) became master shipwrights with their own commercial yards. Joseph also succeeded to his father's post at Deptford. The date of Pett's second marriage, to Elizabeth Thornton (<i>d</i>. 1597), is unknown; there were at least eight children of this union, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22060/', "Phineas Pett (1570&#150;1647)")</script>, yet another royal master shipwright, was the most notable. Through his offspring and their descendants Peter Pett founded a dynasty of shipwrights that dominated both royal and private Thames dockyards throughout most of the seventeenth century. Even eight generations after his death one descendant, Peter Rolt (1798&#150;1882) was chairman of the Thames ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, which in 1912 was destined to launch the last new ship constructed on the Thames. Pett died, still working, at Deptford on or about 6 September 1589.<br>
