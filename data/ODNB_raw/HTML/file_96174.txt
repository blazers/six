<span class="headword">Woof,  Robert Samuel</span>  (1931&#150;2005), <span class="occ">literary scholar and museum director</span>, was born on 20 April 1931 at Royal Albert Farm, Lancaster, the third child of William Woof, a progressive farm manager, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mason. He became head boy at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and in 1950 won an open scholarship to read history at Pembroke College, Oxford; he soon changed to English literature, graduating with a second-class degree in 1953. A Goldsmith's fellowship in the same year took him to the University of Toronto, where his graduate studies were supervised by the distinguished Romantic scholars Kathleen Coburn and J. R. MacGillivray; he began at this time to study manuscripts at the Wordsworth Library, Grasmere. In 1959 he made the first of many contributions to Romantic scholarship when he completed his PhD thesis at Toronto on &#145;The literary relations of Wordsworth and Coleridge&#146;. The previous year he had been appointed a lecturer in English at Toronto and had married Pamela Shirley Moore, who had also read English at Oxford. They had two sons and two daughters. Pamela Woof went on to her own career as a literary scholar, and biographer and editor of Dorothy Wordsworth.<br>
<br>In 1961 Woof resigned his lectureship at Toronto to become Lord Adams of Ennerdale research fellow at King's College, University of Durham (later the University of Newcastle upon Tyne). The following year he was appointed lecturer in English, and from 1971 to 1992 he was reader in English literature. At Newcastle he did not confine himself to teaching: with characteristic energy he played a leading role in many aspects of the city's cultural life. At the university he took charge of creative writing, then not an academic discipline. He acted as a judge in literary competitions, and was assessor for the work of the Morden Tower, a significant poetry venue. He was also instrumental in setting up a two-year poetry fellowship at the universities of Newcastle and Durham; among the poets he helped appoint were Tony Harrison, Basil Bunting, and Fleur Adcock. The theatre was another lifelong passion: he represented the university on the board of the Tyne and Wear Theatre Company, helped student amateur groups, and every spring brought the Royal Shakespeare Company to Newcastle for a six-week season of performances, workshops, and seminars. A confirmed bibliophile, he was chairman of the Friends of the University Library.<br>
<br>Beyond Newcastle, Woof was vice-chairman of Northern Arts from 1974 to 1981, and in the 1980s held a number of positions on the Arts Council of Great Britain, including vice-chairman of drama and chairman of literature. In 1991 he was invited to take over the chairmanship of the Century Theatre in Keswick, which he successfully split into two companies: first, Theatre by the Lake, which remained in Keswick; and second, English Touring Theatre, which became under his leadership one of Britain's leading classical touring companies.<br>
<br>Woof's greatest achievement, however, was his work at the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere; it was there that his combination of erudition, creativity, and practical ingenuity found its fullest expression. Since its foundation in 1891, the trust had preserved Dove Cottage, William Wordsworth's home from 1799 to 1808, for &#145;lovers of English poetry from all over the world&#146;. The trust was also the guardian of some 90 per cent of the poet's manuscripts. When Woof was appointed a trustee in 1970 it had remained essentially the same since the 1930s; he at once saw its hidden potential, and over the next thirty-five years, with rare dedication, he set about transforming it into a centre of international standing. As honorary keeper of collections he sought funding, and oversaw the conservation, first of Dove Cottage itself, and then, personally transporting manuscripts to the Cockerell workshop in Cambridge, of some 15,000 books and manuscripts. Further, thanks to his enlightened approach to acquisition, the collections in Grasmere widened in scope to include rare editions and manuscripts of most of the literary and political figures of the Romantic age; the work of the many artists who visited the lakes, such as Turner, Constable, and Wright of Derby, was included.<br>
<br>The trustees supported Woof's transformation of an old coach house into a museum, which was opened in 1981 with a permanent Wordsworth exhibition and space for changing displays. It also, crucially, had the security and environmental controls needed to persuade both institutions and private collectors to lend priceless treasures to the series of special exhibitions on Romantic themes that Woof created, supported by brilliant catalogues. On top of this there were winter and summer international residential and scholarly conferences held in Grasmere; an award-winning educational programme for schools; and, under Woof's direction, an advanced training in museum studies that helped hundreds of recent graduates to gain an awareness of career possibilities. In return the trainees helped with the trust's activities and responsibilities to the public.<br>
<br>In 1992 Woof resigned from the University of Newcastle to become the first director of the Wordsworth Trust. He encouraged a contemporary as well as a historical creativity, initiating the linking of the art and poetry of the past with that of the present through poet and artist residencies, weekly readings by contemporary writers, and contemporary art exhibitions. He kept the place as well as the trust's activities in mind, and by purchasing a number of nearby properties extended a quiet, unobtrusive protection around Dove Cottage and its garden. The culmination of his work in Grasmere was the planning and construction of a superb new building to house the collections. The Jerwood Centre at the Wordsworth Trust, modern yet sympathetic, was an architectural triumph, a great library, and a repository of Romantic works; it was formally opened in June 2005 by the poet Seamus Heaney.<br>
<br>This development of the Wordsworth Trust was achieved against the odds, and the constant need to raise money was mentally and emotionally demanding. Nevertheless Woof still found time for the scholarship that provided the foundation for all this activity. His memorable lectures (lasting anywhere between an hour and half a morning) embraced literature, art, history, and the Lake District; some exhibitions went on to the New York Public Library, the British Library, and the National Library of Scotland. The interdisciplinary nature of the work enabled Woof to make the surprising intellectual connections in which he delighted and excelled. The many catalogues published by the Wordsworth Trust were indeed books. His edition of T. W. Thompson's <span class="italic">Wordsworth's Hawkshead</span> (1970) was a treasure house of original research. Many articles testified to his scholarship. His magisterial account, from unpublished manuscripts as well as printed works, of Wordsworth criticism, <span class="italic">Wordsworth: the Critical Heritage</span>, was published in 2001. In his last years he brought out an edition of Hazlitt's <span class="italic">Spirit of the Age</span> (2004), with his own essays matching Hazlitt's; in 2005 his <span class="italic">Treasures of the Wordsworth Trust</span> appeared, a historical and scholarly account. Posthumously, in 2007, came his edition of Wordsworth's masterpiece completed in 1805, the thirteen-book <span class="italic">Prelude</span>.<br>
<br>In person Woof was animated, intense, humorous, generous, and immensely and immediately likeable. Blessed with a formidable memory, he drew lightly upon an astonishing range of reference, and in conversation was always persuasive, often inspirational. He was a fine reader of Wordsworth's poetry. His contribution to the artistic life of Britain was recognized in a number of awards and honours: honorary degrees from the universities of Lancaster, Newcastle, and Central Lancashire; the Northern Electric award in 1995; and the Creative Briton award in 1999. He was appointed CBE in 1998.<br>
<br>A non-smoker, Woof died of lung cancer on 7 November 2005 at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne. The funeral was at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere, on 24 November 2005, and a memorial gathering, overwhelmingly attended, was held at the National Portrait Gallery, London, on 28 March 2006. He was survived by his wife, Pamela, and their four children.<br>
