<span class="headword">Denis <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Holdsworth]</span>,  Michaela</span> <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Michaela Lindsay, Lady Lindsay]</span>  (1914&#150;2003), <span class="occ">writer and wildlife film-maker</span>, is thought to have been born in London on 28 August 1914. According to her own account she was an only child, as her father, whom she described as an archaeologist from Yorkshire, was killed in one of the early battles of the First World War, and she was brought up in west London by her White Russian mother and grandmother. She was artistically gifted and set out on a career in fashion; this was very much in keeping with her energetic and dauntless character, which she always attributed to being an only child, doted on by her mother and grandmother. She won a scholarship to a fashion school in London and subsequently trained as a dress designer in Paris, where she lived until the outbreak of the the Second World War. She returned to London and joined the Women's Voluntary Service, adapting the uniform to her own stylish design.<br>
<br>In 1945 Michaela Holdsworth met an American admiral at a party in a Park Lane hotel; he proposed to her over a lavish bouquet of red roses the next day. She recognized that she was not attracted to him and had grave misgivings as he was a widower with young children, but&#151;always the pragmatist&#151;she badly wanted to get away from bombed-out London to America. She accepted his proposal and sailed for New York, but week by week delayed leaving for California to join him. Eventually she told him that she could not marry him as she could never love him. Some weeks later she met the Belgian film-maker Armand Denis (1897&#150;1971) at a New York party. It was a <i>coup de foudre</i> and they soon started an affair. Armand was waiting for his divorce from Leila Roosevelt (of the American political family) to be finalized, and had four children. His and Leila's marriage had been stormy, and his friends were adamant that he would not get married again; but by the time his film unit left for an assignment in South America Michaela was on the trip. They were married by special licence in Potos&iacute; in the high Andes in 1948; the ring was from a Christmas cracker and the start of their honeymoon was spent in gaol after a misunderstanding at a border post.<br>
<br>Michaela Denis's extraordinarily successful film and television career was launched as she gradually emerged from behind the camera as Armand's assistant to become a presenter herself. Her striking blonde looks, confidence, and good humour, together with Armand's heavily accented and slightly lugubrious English, made them an unforgettable partnership from their first radio broadcast on the BBC's <span class="italic">In Town Tonight</span> in 1955 (to promote their feature <span class="italic">Filming Wild Animals</span>). Their first BBC TV series, <span class="italic">Filming in Africa</span> (1955), was followed by <span class="italic">On Safari</span> (1957&#150;9 and 1961&#150;5), which initially ran in fifteen-minute slots but was so popular with viewers that the time slot was extended to half an hour. The combination of Armand's stunning black and white filming, the locations, proximity to wild animals, and the personalities of the Denises was unique, as was Michaela's fearlessness. There were comedic moments too: Michaela's tendency to apply lipstick or comb her hair before confronting an animal earned her much mimicry. Subsequent TV series included <span class="italic">Safari to Asia</span> (1959&#150;61), a series for ATV, <span class="italic">Armand and Michaela Denis</span> (1955&#150;8), several full-length feature films including <span class="italic">Below the Sahara</span> (1954), and the books Michaela based on their experiences: <span class="italic">Leopard in my Lap</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">Ride a Rhino</span> (1959).<br>
<br>The Denises spent much of the 1950s filming in Africa&#151;Armand was technical adviser and Michaela acted as Deborah Kerr's stand-in during the filming of <span class="italic">King Solomon's Mines</span> in 1950&#151;and they spoke passable Swahili and could get by in a few other local languages. By 1958 their dream house built above the Mbagathi river in Langata, on the outskirts of Nairobi, was completed. From then until her death Michaela regarded Kenya as her home although the Denises lived for short periods in New York, Florida, Antwerp, and London, either renting a house in Curzon Street or staying at Claridge's. Her marriage to Armand was an extremely happy one. When he developed Parkinson's disease she nursed him until his death in 1971, setting great store by alternative healing, for which she believed she had an aptitude&#151;indeed, she founded a free Saturday-morning clinic at her home that was open to anybody, including a local witchdoctor's son. A strong believer in extra-terrestrial beings, she would describe in minute detail a sighting she and Armand had of a blue spaceship moving over the Masai reserve, and she had a fascination with crop circles in Britain.<br>
<br>In August 1975 Michaela Denis married in Nairobi, secondly, and as his third wife, Sir William O'Brien Lindsay (1909&#150;1975), a British-born barrister who had retired as chief justice of Sudan in 1955 and founded a law practice in Nairobi. He died in his sleep beside her in October that year. She claimed it was because he had made himself so angry thinking about his previous wife. After his death she stayed on in Kenya, proving herself an able businesswoman, particularly in property development. She had homes in Nairobi and on the coast, and inherited a small house in Ealing, London, where she would escape the African heat in the summer. It was in Ealing that she began work on her autobiography, which remained unfinished. She had a fund of stories and anecdotes, particularly about other white Africans, many of whom frequented the Muthaiga Club (made famous in the book and film <span class="italic">White Mischief</span>), of which she was a member. She was a close friend of Louis Leakey; disliked Karen Blixen, whom she considered wildly promiscuous; and disapproved of the way Joy Adamson (author of <span class="italic">Born Free</span>, and Michaela's rival) treated her servants, having once intervened when Adamson was beating her kitchen boy.<br>
<br>Despite her outdoor life filming before the availability of proper sunscreen, Michaela Denis had beautiful, pale, undamaged skin until the end of her life, albeit having been in a bad car crash in the late 1940s when her face had to be rebuilt by Sir Archibald McIndoe. She was completely untroubled by this. Indeed, because her nose would ache before a rainstorm, she would sometimes use it to good effect during filming, most memorably when she got advance warning of rain at a rain dance in Rwanda starring a female witchdoctor who had predicted rain and was about to be killed when nothing had happened. A vegetarian, Michaela Denis had a lifelong, genuine passion for animals. In 1963 she damaged a picture of a bull wounded in a bullfight that was hanging on the railings in Piccadilly and exclaimed &#145;I bonkered it, I bonkered it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). She represented east Africa at the World Federation for the Protection of Animals in Geneva. She was on the committee of the Kenya Society for the Protection and Care of Animals, and was vice-chairman of the Kenya branch of the Men of Trees, a silvicultural conservation movement. She led a full life right up until her death in Nairobi, Kenya, on 4 May 2003. She had no children.<br>
