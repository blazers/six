<span class="headword">Bowen,  Emanuel</span>  (1693/4&#150;1767), <span class="occ">engraver and map maker</span>, was the son of Owen Bowen (<i>d</i>. 1730), gentleman, of Talley, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1721). On 7 September 1709 he was apprenticed to Charles Price, globe and instrument maker and a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and this date suggests that Bowen was born about 1693/4. Price, also from Carmarthenshire, had been apprenticed to John Seller senior.<br>
<br>Bowen married Elizabeth Boreman on 6 February 1714 and their daughter Sarah was born about 1719. During his apprenticeship he engraved maps for George Willdey's <span class="italic">Atlas of the World</span> (1717). 1720 saw the publication of the <span class="italic">Britannia depicta</span>, a popular reduced version of John Ogilby's road atlas augmented by fifty-four county maps and historical notes by John Owen. Simultaneously, Bowen was engraving and selling prints and in 1722 one of these, a portrait of the bishop of Rochester, a Jacobite sympathizer, led to his being falsely accused of stirring up &#145;the minds of the Vulgar to Disaffection against the Government&#146;.<br>
<br>During this period Bowen became a freemason and in 1723 was listed as senior warden of the Newgate Street Lodge in London. Three years later he appeared as master of a newly established lodge meeting at the Naggshead and Starr in Carmarthen and this continuing link to his home locality is significant in that &#145;A new and accurate map of South Wales &hellip; delineated from an actual survey and admeasurement by Eman. Bowen&#146; appeared in 1729. This six-sheet map, superior to previous ones of the region, contains a decorative baroque dedication panel to George, prince of Wales, and topographical views of five towns. Its 500 subscribers were mostly south Wales gentry whose houses are also indicated on the map. The subscribers' list locates two Bowens in his home area and a number of members of the newly formed Carmarthen Lodge. Large-scale maps of Norfolk and Huntingdonshire and &#145;A new and accurate map of England and Wales&#146; (1734) soon followed. The latter, a large display map with borders containing the coats of arms of 205 MPs who voted against the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> of 1733, is described by Shirley as a &#145;tour de force of its kind&#146;. In 1732 and 1735 Bowen took on two apprentices, Thomas Kitchin and Thomas Jefferys, who also became eminent map makers. It was about this time that his son <a href="#cosubject_3041">Thomas Bowen [<i>see below</i>]</a> was born.<br>
<br>Between 1721 and 1750 Bowen engraved charts for some of the leading hydrographers of his day, including Joseph Avery, Samuel Fearon and John Eyes, Nicholas Dobr&eacute;e, and Murdoch Mackenzie. His prolific output for British periodicals (1736&#150;63), rivalled only by John Lodge and Thomas Kitchin, includes seventy-six British and foreign maps in the <span class="italic">General Magazine of Arts and Sciences</span>, the foreign ones illuminating subjects of contemporary interest. In 1763 Bowen produced &#145;An accurate map of North America describing &hellip; the British, Spanish and French dominions as defined in the treaty of Paris 1763&#146;. This four-sheet map, engraved by John Gibson, was reissued a number of times.<br>
<br>Bowen's contribution to eighteenth-century world and British atlases was substantial. Consulting a wide range of contemporary sources, he drew and newly engraved seventy maps for his <span class="italic">Complete System of Geography</span> (2 vols., 1744&#150;7), most being reissued in his <span class="italic">Complete Atlas</span> (1752) and <span class="italic">The Maps and Charts to the Modern Part of the Universal History</span> (published in 1766 under Thomas Kitchin's name). He produced maps for John Harris's <span class="italic">Navigantium atque itinerantium bibliotheca</span> (1744&#150;8), and all twenty-two new plates in the final edition (1754) of Patrick Gordon's <span class="italic">Geography Anatomized</span> were also his. Over the period 1749&#150;60, together with Kitchin, who had married his daughter Sarah in 1739, Bowen used the most recent surveys to compile and engrave a set of county maps for his <span class="italic">Large English Atlas</span> (1760). The commercial success of this important and influential work, the first to cover England and Wales on a large scale, led to the maps being reduced and modified by Bowen and Kitchin for their <span class="italic">Royal English Atlas</span> (<i>c</i>.1763) and then by Emanuel and Thomas Bowen for <span class="italic">Atlas Anglicanus</span> (1767&#150;8), published after Emanuel Bowen's death by Kitchin. All three works are characterized by detailed texts in the spaces surrounding the maps and by elegant rococo decoration, which became the hallmark of his engraving.<br>
<br>Initially located Next the Stairs in St Katharine's, his address in 1742 was the Progress of the Ship, Clerkenwell. His very active involvement in the affairs of the nearby Barbican Baptist chapel up to a year before his death suggests that he remained in that same area of London. Reporting that he had died in London on 8 May 1767, the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> for July 1767 draws attention to &#145;his reduced circumstances by family extravagances&#146; and reports that he was &#145;almost blind through age&#146;  (July 1767, 372). As a compiler and engraver rather than a publisher of maps, the valuable copperplates he worked would have been owned by others. It is, however, still difficult to understand why he died penniless, since he was industrious and able and had the distinction of being geographer to George II from about 1747 and, according to many sources (particularly Chubb), geographer to Louis XV of France.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_3041"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Bowen</span>  (1732/3&#150;1790), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was indentured on 7 February 1748 to his father, Emanuel Bowen. This suggests that he was born about 1732/3. In the decade following the end of his apprenticeship he engraved a few maps for the <span class="italic">General Magazine of Arts and Sciences</span> but, in general, he was overshadowed by his father. Of five maps he engraved in British periodicals, two were by the elder Bowen and two of the three county maps by Thomas Bowen in <span class="italic">The Royal English Atlas</span> were &#145;revised, corrected and improved by Eman. Bowen&#146;. After his father's death Thomas informed the subscribers of <span class="italic">Atlas Anglicanus</span> that, having worked alongside his father in its preparation, he was competent to complete the task. When it appeared in 1768 most of the maps were attributed jointly to them. The same year saw the publication of Philip Morant's <span class="italic">History of Essex</span>, to which father and son contributed two and four maps respectively. On 25 December of that year Thomas was married to Alice Downes, thought to be from an engraving family, at St John, Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>The next fifteen years, as Bowen became more established as an engraver and compiler of British and foreign maps and charts, were his most productive. Among the British maps he engraved are &#145;A new and correct map of the countries twenty miles round London&#146; (1770); nine, which include five road maps, in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1773&#150;9); eight in the <span class="italic">Survey and Maps of the Roads of North Britain or Scotland</span> (1776) by George Taylor and Andrew Skinner; and &#145;A map of Great Britain&#146; in Charles Burlington's <span class="italic">Modern Universal British Traveller</span> (1779). His substantial foreign map output includes three charts relating to James Cook's voyages, jointly engraved with John Gibson for John Hawkesworth's <span class="italic">An Account of the Voyages Undertaken &hellip; for Making Discoveries</span>; a large single-sheet &#145;Map of the province of South Carolina&#146; and his extension to eleven sheets of the &#145;Chart of part of the West Indies &hellip; by &hellip; Joseph Speer&#146;, all published in 1773. Numerous maps and further charts by Thomas Bowen are also found in Charles Theodore Middleton's <span class="italic">A New and Complete System of Geography</span> (1777&#150;9) and Jonathan Carver's <span class="italic">The New Universal Traveller</span> (1779). Later single works include the three-sheet map of Morea by Peter Bell (1785), and &#145;A new and complete chart of the world&#146;, drawn and engraved by him for <span class="italic">Bankes's New System of Geography</span> (1790).<br>
<br>Although his output was not as extensive as that of his father, Thomas Bowen's maps and charts, with their simpler post-rococo decoration, made a valuable if modest contribution to the cartography of the last part of the eighteenth century. He spent most of his working life in Clerkenwell, his last recorded address being 9 Charterhouse Lane, and died there in the workhouse in early 1790. It is, again, difficult to understand why he, like his father, should have ended his days in poverty, as the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of March 1790 records his death under &#145;Considerable Persons&#146; and refers to him as &#145;an eminent engraver of charts &hellip; the son of Emanuel B. esq. engraver to his late Majesty&#146;  (p. 374).<br>
