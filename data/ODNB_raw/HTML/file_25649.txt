<span class="headword">Sirr,  Henry Charles</span>  (1764?&#150;1841), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, born in Dublin Castle probably on 25 November 1764, was fifth, but eldest surviving, son of Major Joseph Sirr (1715&#150;1799), who, on retiring from the army after twenty years' service, was appointed to the post of chief of the Dublin police or town-major in 1761, and served as high sheriff of the county in 1771. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of William Hall of Skelton Castle, Yorkshire. Sirr entered the army on 6 June 1778 as an ensign in the 68th regiment of foot; subsequently he was lieutenant in the same regiment, which he accompanied in 1782 to Gibraltar. In 1791 he quitted the service, and was engaged as a wine merchant in Dublin, where he lived successively in French Street and at 77 Dame Street. In the same year he married Elizabeth, daughter of James D'Arcy of Hyde Park, co. Westmeath. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1796, upon the formation of yeomanry in Dublin, Sirr volunteered and was appointed acting town-major or head of the police, and thenceforward was the chief agent of the castle authorities. In 1798 he was promoted to the position of town-major, and received a residence in Dublin Castle. He proved very active in political repression, and organized an extensive system of spies and informers. He successfully arrested Peter Finnerty, the editor of <span class="italic">The Press</span>, on 31 October 1797, and was concerned in almost every important capture during the troubled years from 1798 to Emmet's insurrection in 1803. During this period his life was often in serious peril; on no fewer than three occasions in 1798 he barely escaped the attacks of the United Irishmen. The part Sirr played in the capture of Lord Edward Fitzgerald on 19 May 1798 brought him most prominently before the public. In the affray on that occasion Sirr, in coming to the aid of Daniel Frederick Ryan, inflicted on Lord Edward the wound from which he died. In 1802, in the case of <i>Hevey v. Sirr</i>, he was sued for &pound;5000 damages for false imprisonment, and was held up to execration by Curran, the counsel for the plaintiff. The jury found a verdict against him for &pound;150 and 6<i>d</i>. costs, but the government paid Sirr's legal expenses. On 25 August 1803 he was instrumental in the arrest of Robert Emmet and the other insurrectionary leaders. In 1808 Sirr was appointed a police magistrate for the city of Dublin. He continued to discharge his duties as town-major until 1826, when he retired upon full pay, and in consideration of his services was allowed to retain his official residence in Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>Sirr devoted his leisure to collecting curiosities and antiquities. His collection, which included some five hundred paintings, was of considerable value, and was acquired after his death by the Royal Irish Academy. In 1818 he helped to found the Irish Society for Promoting Scriptural Education in the Irish Language. He was an evangelical and an active freemason, and in 1797 joined the Orange order. He died at Dublin Castle on 7 January 1841, and was buried in the graveyard of St Werburgh's, Dublin, in close proximity to Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Sirr transformed the office of town-major from a sinecure into a vital and efficient cog in the Dublin Castle machinery. The authorities came to rely upon him to an extraordinary degree, and he was highly esteemed by them. Robert Peel testified in the House of Commons that Sirr was unswervingly loyal, religious, and humane. Castlereagh also praised &#145;the unceasing activity of Major Sirr&#146;.<br>
<br>Sirr intended to destroy all his correspondence; but a number of documents, many of them of considerable historical interest, were found after his death, and presented by his elder son to the library of Trinity College, Dublin, where they remain.<br>
<br>Sirr's elder son, <a name="cosubject_25650"></a><span class="headword">Joseph D'Arcy Sirr</span>  (1794&#150;1868), a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, rector of Ringwood, and afterwards (1859) of Morstead in Hampshire, was the author of a <span class="italic">Memoir of Power le Poer Trench, Last Archbishop of Tuam</span> (1845), of <span class="italic">Sacrifices, Past, Present, and Future</span> (1862), and of a <span class="italic">Life of Archbishop Usher</span>, prefixed to <span class="italic">The Religion of the Ancient Irish</span> (1835), in addition to some minor religious works. He died at Winchester on 5 April 1868. The younger son, <a name="cosubject_25649"></a><span class="headword">Henry Charles Sirr</span>  (1807&#150;1872), of Lincoln's Inn, <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was successively British vice-consul at Hong Kong (1843) and queen's advocate for the southern circuit of Ceylon; he was the author of two works of interest, <span class="italic">China and the Chinese: their Religion, Character, Customs, and Manufactures</span> (1849), which dealt with the evils of the opium trade, and <span class="italic">Ceylon and the Cingalese: their History, Government, Religion, Antiquities, etc.</span> (1850). He died at his home, 140 Albany Street, Regent's Park, London, on 23 November 1872 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
