<span class="headword">Birch,  Jonathan</span>  (1783&#150;1847), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born in Holborn, London, on 4 July 1783. When young he wanted to become a sculptor, but in October 1798 he was apprenticed to an uncle in the City. In 1803 he entered the house of Johann Argelander, a wealthy timber merchant at Memel, East Prussia; the site of the house has been marked since 1993 by a memorial plaque. He remained there until Argelander's death in 1812, much of his time being employed in travelling in Russia, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. In 1807 the three eldest sons of Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia took refuge with Argelander for eighteen months. They became enduring friends of both Birch and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander, son of the merchant, who became a distinguished astronomer.<br>
<br>In 1812 Birch returned to England and turned to literary pursuits. In 1823 he married Esther Brooke, of Lancaster. They had five children, of whom a boy and a girl survived. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2427/', "Charles Bell Birch (1832&#150;1893)")</script>, became a sculptor. His father's friendship with Friedrich Wilhelm IV secured him several commissions.<br>
<br>After many minor essays in literature Birch published <span class="italic">Fifty-one Original Fables, with Morals and Ethical Index</span>, illustrated by Robert Cruickshank (1833). The preface is signed &#145;Job Crithannah&#146;, an anagram of the author's name. Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm accepted a copy, and renewed the friendship formed at Memel. Birch then produced <span class="italic">Divine Emblems</span> (1838), again illustrated by Robert Cruickshank, under the pseudonym Johann Albricht, A.M. (another anagram of Jonathan Birch). He sent Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm a copy and received in return a gold medal, of which only thirty were struck and which the prince gave to his particular friends.<br>
<br>Birch then undertook a complete verse translation of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>. The first English translation had appeared in 1823, but Birch was the first to attempt part one and part of part two. Part one (1839) was dedicated to the crown prince, who, on coming to the throne in 1840 as Friedrich Wilhelm IV, sent him the &#145;great gold medal of homage&#146;. Others, however, were less favourably impressed. The <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span> (1840) declared that &#145;As a translation it is bad, as a poetic translation it is worse, but as a translation of <span class="italic">Faust</span> it is worst of all.&#146; In 1841 Birch was elected &#145;foreign honorary member of the Literary Society of Berlin&#146;, the only other Englishman thus honoured being Thomas Carlyle. His translation of part of the second part of <span class="italic">Faust</span> was published in 1843 and was dedicated to Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia. Together the two parts of the translation have met near universal condemnation, and are now chiefly remembered for a reissue of 1886 (now very rare: a copy exists in the Beinecke Library, Yale), each page of which carried the boldly printed slogan &#145;Beecham's Pills&#146;. Birch kept alive his attachment to the Prussian royal house with his two translations of Rulemann Friedrich Eylert's works on the domestic and religious life of Friedrich Wilhelm III (1844 and 1845). In 1846 Friedrich Wilhelm IV offered him a choice of apartments in three of his palaces. He chose Bellevue, near Berlin, mainly for the sake of his son's artistic studies. At the end of 1846 Birch settled in Prussia and completed his last work, a verse translation after Carl Lachmann's text of the <span class="italic">Nibelungen Lied</span> (Berlin, 1848). While his work was still in the press he was taken ill, and he died at Bellevue on 8 September 1847.<br>
