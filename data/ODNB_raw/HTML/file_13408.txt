<span class="headword">Hobson,  Richard</span>  (1795&#150;1868), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Whitehaven, Cumberland, the second son of Christopher Hobson, a barrister, of Bootle, Cumberland, and Anna Dixon. After school at St Bees and at Wakefield, he was sent to study medicine at St George's Hospital, London. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and having finally decided to become a physician, went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1820, before migrating to Sidney Sussex College, and finally to Queens' College, where he graduated MB in 1825 and MD in 1830.<br>
<br>In 1826 Hobson settled in Leeds, where he rapidly acquired a large practice, and on 30 September 1833 he was elected physician to the infirmary there, a post which he resigned in June 1843. During this period he published in the <span class="italic">Medical Gazette</span> some notes on diabetes and on the external use of croton oil. He was consulting physician to the Hospital for Women and Children from 1853 to his death.<br>
<br>Hobson was devoted to field sports from his youth, and while in Leeds he belonged to the Harewood coursing club, bred racehorses, and hunted with the Bramham hunt. For a short time he kept a pack of harriers. He had some knowledge of natural history, and built up excellent collections of stuffed birds, mosses, and lichens. In 1836 he became acquainted with the naturalist Charles Waterton, who lived at Walton Hall, about 12 miles from Leeds. Hobson became physician to the family and a frequent visitor, and Waterton often wrote to him. Their friendship ended a few years before Waterton's death. Hobson had written a memoir of Waterton and claimed he had received the naturalist's approval for the work, <span class="italic">Charles Waterton: his Home, Habits, and Handiwork</span>, which was published in 1866. However, abundant internal evidence shows that the statement about Waterton's approval of the manuscript is untrue. Many of the stories in the book appear to be false, and the letters given were altered.<br>
<br>After being injured in a fall from his carriage, Hobson was confined to his house, where he broke his thigh bone, and died unexpectedly on 29 November 1868 at 10 Park Place, Leeds. His wife, a daughter of Peter Rhodes of Leeds, had died some years before. There were no children. Hobson was accounted &#145;one of the oldest and most respected medical men in Leeds&#146; by his contemporaries  (Mayhall, 3.224).<br>
