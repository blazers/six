<span class="headword">Bingley,  William</span>  (1774&#150;1823), <span class="occ">naturalist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Doncaster, Yorkshire, early in January 1774 and baptized there on the 7th. He was orphaned while still very young. He was educated at a school in Doncaster, where his friends urged him to pursue a career in law, but his own inclinations were for a more tranquil life in the church. With this end in mind he matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1795, graduating BA in 1799 and MA in 1803. He was ordained deacon at York in 1799 and became curate at Mirfield in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the same year.<br>
<br>Bingley was a noted writer on botany, topography, and popular zoology. His travels in Wales while still an undergraduate formed the basis of his two-volume, illustrated, <span class="italic">Tour of North Wales</span> (1800; 2nd edn, 1814), which includes a catalogue of Welsh plants. He returned to Wales in 1801 and afterwards issued a topographical account, <span class="italic">North Wales</span> (2 vols., 1804). During the same period he published one of his most popular zoological works, <span class="italic">Animal Biography</span> (1802), which went through multiple editions and was translated into a number of European languages. In a similar vein he published <span class="italic">Memoirs of British Quadrupeds</span> (1809), and <span class="italic">Animated Nature</span> (1814). These works gave an entertaining and palatable introduction to the basic zoological facts: <span class="italic">Animated Nature</span>, a contemporary noted, contained nothing which might &#145;prove offensive to the most delicate female mind&#146;  (Bingley, vii).<br>
<br>Bingley served as curate of the priory in Christchurch, Hampshire, from 1802 to 1816. From 1816 to 1823 he was minister of Fitzroy Chapel (St Saviour's) in Charlotte Street, London. He was married but his wife's name is not known. His son, William Richard Bingley, published (and amended) the third edition of <span class="italic">North Wales</span> (1839). Though Bingley continued to publish on natural history, producing, among other works, <span class="italic">A Practical Introduction to Botany</span> (1817), he also indulged a strong taste for compilation. Among his compilative (and none too critical) works were <span class="italic">Musical Biography</span> (1814), a series of popular biographical compilations on British characters, eminent voyagers, celebrated travellers, and Roman characters, and six volumes of travel writings designed as abridged popular versions of the accounts given by those who actually did the travelling.<br>
<br>Bingley's major projected work was his county history of Hampshire. Though much material was collected he did not live to complete this, and only a small portion of it was ever published (<span class="italic">The Topographical Account of the Hundred of Bosmere</span>, privately published in 1817). He died at his home in Charlotte Street, London, on 11 March 1823 and was buried at St George's Church, Bloomsbury.<br>
