<span class="headword">Pyke,  Geoffrey Nathaniel Joseph</span>  (1893&#150;1948), <span class="occ">educationist and inventor</span>, was born at 19 Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, London, on 10 December 1893, the eldest son of Lionel Edward Pyke QC (1854&#150;1899), a barrister at the Admiralty bar who stood unsuccessfully as a Gladstonian Liberal parliamentary candidate for Wiltshire South in the general election of 1895, and his wife, Mary Rachel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas. The Pykes were a well-established Jewish family in London. His grandfather Joseph Pyke (1824&#150;1902) had been the warden of London's Central Synagogue; the food scientist Magnus Pyke was his cousin.<br>
<br>Following his father's death when he was only five, Pyke was educated for two years at Wellington College (1907&#150;09), where he was very unhappy; this experience shaped the rest of his life. His reaction against the education he received at Wellington turned him into a bohemian character with Marxist leanings and an educational reformer. Wellington's links with the army also made him wary of the military establishment. He then had private tuition, and entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, to study law, but he never took a degree because of the outbreak of the First World War. After a brief spell as Reuter's correspondent in Copenhagen he came up with the audacious idea of becoming the Berlin correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, working undercover. He was soon arrested by the Germans for spying and was detained at the internment camp at Ruhleben on the outskirts of Berlin. He methodically planned his escape from the camp, and in June 1915 he broke out with Edward Falk. They eventually reached the Dutch border and Pyke found himself a hero when he arrived back in Fleet Street. He took advantage of his new-found celebrity to publish <span class="italic">To Ruhleben and Back: a Great Adventure in Three Phases</span> (1916). Unwilling to produce misleading propaganda for the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, he moved to an intellectual review, the <span class="italic">Cambridge Magazine</span>, edited by Charles Kay Ogden.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1918, at the Marylebone register office, Pyke married Margaret Amy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54693/', "Pyke, Margaret Amy")</script>], the daughter of William Lindsay Chubb, a medical practitioner. Soon afterwards the <span class="italic">Cambridge Magazine</span> closed down and he began a new career as an investor in the City, principally in metals. Pyke believed he could use a scientific approach, with the use of charts and data analysis, to make large profits on the metals exchange (where the margins were smaller than the stock exchange) and he used the financial technique of hedging to increase these profits. His methods were, with hindsight, pioneering if also very risky. The Pykes had a son, David (1921&#150;2001), who became a consultant physician at King's College Hospital, London, and an expert on diabetes. Geoffrey was soon preoccupied by the question of his son's education. He wanted to create an education that promoted curiosity and equipped young people to live in the twentieth century. To do this he set up a school in his Cambridge home, The Maltings, in October 1924, funded by his City speculations. He hired the psychologist Susan Isaacs to run the school and promised her that he would not interfere. She created a new type of education based on the theories of the American philosopher and educationist John Dewey, the concept of self-directed learning through playing and a heuristic approach to teaching science. For a short time The Maltings was a critical if not a commercial success; it was visited by many educationists and it was the subject of a film documentary. Pyke had ambitious plans for the school and began to interfere with the day-to-day running, whereupon Susan Isaacs left The Maltings.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, at the end of 1927, the value of Pyke's holdings in metals collapsed. The school was forced to close, Margaret Pyke had to take a job as headmistress's secretary in Kent, and she left Geoffrey although they were never divorced. Already suffering from periodic fits of depression and burdened with huge debts to his brokers, he now withdrew from normal life altogether and existed on donations from his close friends. It was only in 1934 that he began to work on a major project again, proposing the establishment of a research institute in South Africa to meet the intellectual challenge of the Nazis' racial and antisemitic theories. This idea came to nothing, but two years later he set up Voluntary Industrial Aid for Spain, which sent the Spanish republicans a wide variety of goods, ranging from Harley Davidson motorcycles and microscopes to sphagnum moss for wound dressings. In this period Pyke found his true metier as a serial inventor, coming up with ingenious solutions for the various problems created by the Spanish Civil War.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1939 Pyke had the idea of carrying out an undercover opinion poll in Germany, the results of which could be used to dissuade Hitler from going to war. The polling itself was successful but the Second World War broke out before the results could be sent to Hitler. Pyke's efforts to carry out similar polls in occupied Europe brought him to the attention of the politician Leo Amery, who became one of Pyke's strongest supporters. Pyke then developed a plan to pin down large German forces in occupied Norway using small but highly mobile units that would attack remote strategic targets like railway lines and hydroelectric plants. Although outnumbered, these units would defeat the Germans because they would be equipped to attack in the snow, using yet-to-be-invented motorized skis rather like modern skidoos. When Louis Mountbatten was made chief of combined operations in March 1942 Amery recommended Pyke to him. Pyke was just the kind of scientific yet unconventional thinker that Mountbatten wanted, and as director of programmes for combined operations Pyke became one of Mountbatten's scientific advisers alongside the physicist J. D. Bernal and the zoologist Solly Zuckerman. Although his ideas often seemed as bizarre as the way he dressed, Pyke had the knack of presenting the basic solutions to problems but allowing specialists to sort out the details. Pyke's Norway strategy developed into a wide-ranging project based on the study of arctic conditions and ice. It led to the manufacture of the Weasel tracked vehicle by the Studebaker Corporation. Originally planned for use on snow in Norway, it actually became a versatile amphibious craft for crossing marshy terrain.<br>
<br>An even more ambitious concept was Project Habbakuk (the spelling originated in a typing error), the development of an ice-ship. Pyke reasoned that ice was a much better material for large ships than steel. It was readily available, did not cost anything, was lighter than water, and most importantly could absorb the shock of a torpedo attack. Furthermore any breach in the ship could be quickly repaired by making more ice. These ships would be huge, twice as large as the SS <i>Queen Mary</i>, and would be used as mobile airports, freighters, and administration centres. Real icebergs could even be used as decoys. At the suggestion of Bernal, this project was taken up by the Austrian refugee chemist Max Perutz, who soon realized that ice mixed with powdered wood was much stronger than ice and also resisted melting; this composite material was later called &#145;Pykecrete&#146;. Churchill gave his backing to the project and a small prototype was constructed in Canada. Project Habbakuk was abandoned in December 1943, when the U-boat danger to the Atlantic conveys had passed and the site of the allied invasion of France had been switched from the Bay of Biscay to Normandy which would be inaccessible to the large ice-ships.<br>
<br>In 1946 Pyke was invited by the psychologist John Cohen to carry out research for a working party preparing a report on nursing recruitment&#151;which was considered to be the largest problem facing the nascent National Health Service&#151;for the minister of health, Aneurin Bevan. Pyke became obsessed with the question of how much a country should pay for its National Health Service. He realized that this enormously complex question had never been posed before and yet a successful answer was crucial to the long-term viability of an institution he firmly believed in as a socialist. He soon came to the conclusion that the key factor was the selection of the correct time frame for planning healthcare and decided that this was the lifetime of the youngest child of the youngest child now living. Such a long time span raised the question of whether people would be willing to make a sacrifice for future generations and if they would be willing to pay to ensure the health of unrelated others. In Pyke's view it was essential to find a society-wide economic imperative for a health service to supplant the individual imperative to maintain one's good health.<br>
<br>Pyke believed he was getting close to the answers he sought when he took an overdose of barbiturates, probably on the evening of 21 February 1948. He was found dead by the landlady of his home in 30 Steele's Road, Hampstead, London, on the morning of 23 February and a coroner's inquest was held on 26 February. The reasons for his suicide are not clear. Working on his own, the complex calculations he was carrying out clearly imposed a great strain on him. He may have despaired of the economic sustainability of the National Health Service, dependent as it was on mass altruism. He was certainly concerned that Whitehall would never allow his report to be published. From his wartime experience, he had become convinced that government officials were the greatest barrier to scientifically based administration and progress. In a letter he wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> a month before he died Pyke railed against Britain's failure to give financial support to the newly formed United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). He argued that many poorer countries had already contributed and wondered how the humanities-based education of British officials made them so lacking in common humanity. His letter was credited with shaming the British government into becoming a contributor to UNICEF but also exposed his doubts about the ability of contemporary British society to reform itself. Pyke had suffered from depression for many years and this alone may be enough to explain his suicide, given the severe weather conditions prevailing during the winter of 1947&#150;8.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span> opened its obituary of Pyke by saying his death &#145;remove[d] one of the most original if unrecognized figures of the present century&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Feb 1948, 5d). Despite producing numerous memoranda he had not published any of his ideas and as they were known only to a close circle of friends he was quickly forgotten by the public. He is best known for Project Habbakuk, but it is his trading of metals, his educational reforms, and his prophetic unfinished report on the economic sustainability of the National Health Service that mark Pyke out as a man ahead of his time.<br>
