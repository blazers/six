<span class="headword">Pearson,  George William</span>  (1875&#150;1973), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and film director</span>, was born at 1 Manor Street, Kennington, London, on 19 March 1875, the only child of George Pearson, a silk cutter, and his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Voysey. He was educated at Archbishop Sumner School in Kennington, then trained as a teacher at Culham College, Oxfordshire. He took on his first headship at St Mark's School, Old Street, London, in 1896. On 2 August 1902 he married Edith Helen Stacey (1881&#150;1961), daughter of William Stacey, a publican. In 1905 he became headmaster at Hornchurch, Essex, and in 1907 at Staples Road Boys' School, Loughton. A sense of restlessness and unfulfilled ambition then led the 36-year-old Pearson to take an extraordinary leap from headmaster to film director.<br>
<br>It was an off-chance attendance at a local hall to see a travelling showman exhibit films that persuaded Pearson to make this dramatic change in life. He notes in his autobiography, &#145;I went, daringly, for it was not respectable for a schoolmaster to be seen at so vulgar an entertainment as the cinema!&#146;  (Pearson, 22). Indeed the cinema was widely seen as a low-class form of entertainment, with unhealthy venues and unseemly clientele. Yet something in the cinema spoke deeply to the idealist in Pearson, and he was able to communicate such feelings to the British branch of the French film company Path&eacute;, which initially accepted some ideas from scripts by Pearson, then startled him by offering him a position as film director, leading him to resign his post at Loughton and join Path&eacute; at the end of 1912.<br>
<br>Pearson swiftly made his mark with features such as <span class="italic">The Fool</span> (1913; based on Kipling's &#145;The Vampire&#146;) and <span class="italic">Heroes of the Mine</span> (1913) before being poached in 1914 by the energetic producer G. B. Samuelson for his new studios at Worton Hall in Hounslow. Pearson had a notable success with the Sherlock Holmes adventure <span class="italic">A Study in Scarlet</span> (1914), which imaginatively substituted Southport Sands for the Salt Lake desert, and with rapid responses to the onset war in <span class="italic">The Cause of the Great European War</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">The Life of Lord Roberts VC</span> (1914). But he found Samuelson's hyperactive enthusiasm exhausting, and moved to the Gaumont company in 1915.<br>
<br>At Gaumont, Pearson enjoyed a commercial hit with <span class="italic">Ultus, the Man from the Dead</span> (1915) and its successor titles, stylish imitations of the French mystery serials produced by Louis Feuillade, before establishing his own film company in 1918 with T. A. Welsh. With Welsh-Pearson Ltd he hit a creative peak. Following early success with <span class="italic">The Better 'Ole</span> (1918; adapted from Bruce Bairnsfather) Pearson discovered the actress with whom he would make his most popular and characteristic films, Betty Balfour. <span class="italic">Nothing Else Matters</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Mord Em'ly</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Love, Life and Laughter</span> (1923), the <span class="italic">Squibs</span> series, and <span class="italic">Reveille</span> (1924) and other films made with Balfour combined comedy, melodrama, and sentiment amid settings that were half-contemporary, half-Dickensian in a form that reflected Pearson's own mental make-up.<br>
<br>Pearson's films had proved popular with British audiences and moderately successful overseas, but began to look old-fashioned in tone by the end of the 1920s. The arrival of sound to cinema ushered in a stylistic as well as a technical change that those such as Pearson were ill equipped to weather, but he nevertheless played a significant role in early sound film history, brought in to produce <span class="italic">Journey's End</span> (1930; based on the R. C. Sherriff play) in Hollywood when the film looked to be in trouble, and producing a notable <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>.<br>
<br>Pearson's film company was reorganized as Welsh-Pearson-Elder in 1928, but went into liquidation in 1930. He continued to be a figure of note in the industry, becoming president of the Association of British Film Directors in 1927. As a film director, however, he rapidly fell to being given cheap &#145;quota quickies&#146; to make: twopenny titles such as <span class="italic">Murder by Rope</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Midnight at Madame Tussaud's</span> (1936). Of these the poignant <span class="italic">Open All Night</span> (1934), with Frank Vosper playing the wistful elderly manager of a hotel who sees that life belongs to the young, feels like a personal testimony. After a brief period with the GPO Film Unit, Pearson ended his film career working as director-in-chief for the Colonial Film Unit, which he joined in 1940 and with which he remained associated until 1955. Here he trained many young directors from the African nations in the basics of film-making, imparting not just technical knowledge but his abiding idealistic beliefs in the value of film.<br>
<br>Pearson was honoured by the industry for his principles as much as his longevity. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and the British Kinematograph Society and a fellow of the British Film Academy. In 1951 he was appointed OBE for services to the British film industry.<br>
<br>Pearson's autobiography, <span class="italic">Flashback</span>, published in 1957, reveals a man of great integrity and good sense, with a still burning passion for how film should appeal to the heart. Such passion was communicated on set through the homilies that Pearson habitually gave to cast and crew during a read-through of the scenario, reminding them of the purpose of their art. To those about to work on <span class="italic">Reveille</span> on 23 January 1924 he said, &#145;I assert that the function of the Screen is to show the EYE a picture &hellip; through this picture to evoke Emotion, followed by Thought &hellip; Memory &hellip; Imagination &hellip; thus forcing the watcher to give of himself &hellip; the ultimate result being a complex thing, part received, part given &hellip; I want theme &hellip; not Plot &hellip; and Manner more subtle than Matter.&#146;  (Pearson papers, Item 7)<br>
<br>Scholastic, a little fusty, principled but pragmatic, all in all a thoroughly decent man in a frequently disreputable business, there has never been anyone else quite like him in the history of British film. His surviving films may be marked by quaintness, but can still draw a tear from the hardest of hearts.<br>
<br>Pearson died in the Mowbray nursing home, Victoria Road, Malvern, Worcestershire, on 8 February 1973, and was cremated at Worcester crematorium. His wife predeceased him. They had four children: Malcolm (a surgeon), Audrey, Winifred (who followed her father into film, becoming a production manager), and Owen (who followed his father's earlier vocation and became a teacher).<br>
