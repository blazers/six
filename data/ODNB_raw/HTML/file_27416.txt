<span class="headword">Thwaites,  George Henry Kendrick</span>  (1812&#150;1882), <span class="occ">botanist and entomologist</span>, was born at Bristol on 9 July 1812. Nothing is known of his childhood. He worked as an accountant, but devoted his leisure to entomology and the microscopical botany of cryptogams (flowerless plants). In 1839 he became Bristol secretary of the Botanical Society of London, and was soon appointed by Dr William Benjamin Carpenter to revise the second edition of his <span class="italic">General Physiology</span> (1841). An acute observer and expert microscopist, his most important observations at this period were those on the mode of propagation and the algal nature of diatoms, which organisms had been previously regarded as animals. This discovery led J. Fran&ccedil;ois Camille Montagne in 1845 to dedicate to him the algal genus <i>Thwaitesia</i>. Thwaites was so isolated in England in his expertise in microscopical botany that many of his discoveries were overlooked and subsequently attributed to later continental workers.<br>
<br>Thwaites was not solely interested in cryptogams. He contributed to Hewett Watson's <span class="italic">Topographical Botany</span>, listing the flowering plants within a 10 mile radius of Bristol, and was an early contributor to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>. One of the first of his discoveries having a direct bearing on horticulture was the raising of two distinct varieties of fuchsia from the two embryos in a single seed. In 1846 he was lecturer on botany at the Bristol School of Pharmacy and afterwards at the medical school, and in 1847 he applied unsuccessfully for a chair of natural history at the Queen's colleges in Ireland.<br>
<br>In March 1849, on the death of George Gardner, Thwaites was appointed superintendent of the botanical gardens at Peradeniya, Ceylon, where he adopted a programme of progressive clearance and supported both economic and informal ornamental planting. His duties were at first mainly scientific, and, turning his attention to the flowering plants, between 1852 and 1856 he contributed numerous descriptions of Sinhalese plants to Hooker's <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, including twenty-five new genera. However, from 1857, when the title of his post was changed from superintendent to director, he became more and more engrossed by the duties of investigating the application of botany to tropical agriculture. In 1858 he began the printing of his only major work, the <span class="italic">Enumeratio plantarum Zeylaniae</span>, which was published in five fascicles (1858&#150;64). In this he was assisted by J. D. Hooker and William Ferguson. In the preface he announced his adherence to the Darwinian view of the nature of species. On the completion of this work he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, on 1 June 1865, and received the degree of doctor of philosophy from the Imperial Leopoldo-Carolinian Academy, and in 1867 Hooker dedicated to him the beautiful genus of Sinhalese climbing plants <i>Kendrickia</i>.<br>
<br>However, Thwaites himself never considered his work as other than a prologue to a complete flora and a catalogue of the extensive sets of dried plants which he communicated to the chief herbaria. In 1860 he established the cinchona nurseries at Hakgala, the success of the cultivation of these plants in Ceylon being largely due to his efforts. His successive official reports deal also with the cultivation of vanilla, tea, cardamoms, cacao, and Liberian coffee. In 1869 he sent the Revd Miles Joseph Berkeley the first specimens of <i>Hemileia vastatrix</i>, the coffee-leaf fungus, and his reports from 1871 to 1880 deal with it and the suggested preventives. After the completion of the <span class="italic">Enumeratio</span> he returned to the study of cryptogams, sending home more than 1200 fungi, which were described by Berkeley and C. E. Broome  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</span>, 11, 1871, 494&#150;572), besides mosses, which were published by William Mitten in 1872, and lichens, some of which were described by the Revd William Allport Leighton in 1870. Thwaites's health began to fail in 1867; Dr Henry Trimen arrived in 1879 to take his place, and Thwaites resigned in February 1880 and retired on a pension, purchasing a pretty bungalow named Fairieland above Kandy.<br>
<br>Thwaites became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1854, and was made a companion in the Order of St Michael and St George in 1878. He died following a few weeks' illness, unmarried, in Kandy, on 11 September 1882; his funeral took place at the Mahaiyawa cemetery, Kandy, on the following day. In addition to official reports, Thwaites contributed some thirty papers to scientific journals, among others to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Entomological Society</span>, to the <span class="italic">Phytologist</span>, and to the <span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>. He also contributed to Frederick Moore's <span class="italic">Lepidoptera of Ceylon</span> (3 vols., 1880&#150;89). According to his successor, Henry Trimen, Thwaites &#145;suffered all his life under the enormous drawback of a delicate and excitable organisation and constantly feeble health; and continually found it necessary to spare himself fatigue and worry&#146;  (Trimen and others, 79).<br>
