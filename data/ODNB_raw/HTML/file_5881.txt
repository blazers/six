<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Henry James</span>  (1822&#150;1893), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, born in London on 20 September 1822, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5887/', "Sir John Taylor Coleridge (1790&#150;1876)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (1788&#150;1874), the second daughter of the Revd Gilbert Buchanan. Henry was a great-nephew of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5886/', "John Duke Coleridge, Baron Coleridge")</script>. His sister, Alethea, married J. Mackarness, later bishop of Oxford. Henry Coleridge was educated at Eton College and then Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1840, graduating BA in 1845 and MA in 1847. From 1845 until 1852 he was a fellow of Oriel College. He came under the influence of the Tractarian movement and, after receiving Anglican orders, accepted the cure of Ottery St Mary and then that of Alphington in Devon, a part of the country with which his family had long been associated. In 1852 he became a Roman Catholic and went to Rome to make a further study of theology at the Pontifical Jesuit University. Ordained priest in 1855, he received his doctor's degree in 1857, and in September of that year entered the Jesuit noviciate at Beaumont Lodge near Windsor. Two years later he joined the staff of St Beuno's, the Jesuit Theological College in north Wales, to lecture in holy scripture; he held this post for six years.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Coleridge was a prolific writer; his many publications included <span class="italic">Vita vitae nostrae meditantibus proposita</span> (1869), <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of St Francis Xavier</span> (2 vols., 1872), <span class="italic">The Life of our Life</span> (18 vols., 1876&#150;92), <span class="italic">The Prisoners of the King: Thoughts on the Catholic Doctrine of Purgatory</span> (1878), and <span class="italic">The Works and Words of our Saviour Gathered from the Four Gospels</span> (1882, 1897).<br>
<br>In April 1865 Coleridge was appointed the first Jesuit editor of <span class="italic">The Month</span>, a periodical begun by Fanny Margaret Taylor in 1864, which she sold to the Jesuits. Living in Hill Street, at the residence of the Jesuit fathers of Farm Street Church in west London, he remained editor until 1881 and was responsible for the successful launching of <span class="italic">The Month</span> as a Jesuit publication. John Henry Newman, whom he had known at Oxford and who had asked for his help with the Catholic University in Dublin, was one with whom he corresponded on the journal's affairs; Coleridge may be considered to have been Newman's closest friend among the Jesuits. A number of articles by Newman were published in <span class="italic">The Month</span> in the 1860s, both before and after the Jesuits acquired ownership; Newman's &#145;The Dream of Gerontius&#146; appeared in the May and June numbers of 1865. The last article Coleridge wrote for <span class="italic">The Month</span> (October 1890), entitled &#145;A father of souls&#146;, was about Newman. After the issue of the &#145;Syllabus of errors&#146; (condemning certain liberal ideas) by Pius IX in 1864 and the promulgation of the definition of papal infallibility as a dogma by the First Vatican Council of 1870, W. E. Gladstone published his pamphlets <span class="italic">The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance: a Political Expostulation</span> and <span class="italic">Vaticanism</span>. In reply Coleridge preached a sermon, &#145;The abomination of desolation&#146;, in Farm Street Church in November 1874 and sent Gladstone a copy; there followed a correspondence.<br>
<br>From 1881, when Coleridge retired from the editorship of <span class="italic">The Month</span>, he spent the rest of his active life writing and editing the <span class="roman">Quarterly Series</span>. Throughout his years in London he gave himself to the pastoral work of Farm Street Church. In June 1891 he suffered a paralytic stroke and, after two years as an invalid, died at Manresa House, Roehampton, on 13 April 1893. His remains were, at Lord Coleridge's special request, interred in the family vault at Ottery St Mary. Photographs show a handsome man of distinguished appearance.<br>
