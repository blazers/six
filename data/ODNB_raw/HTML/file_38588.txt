<span class="headword">Smedley,  Joseph</span>  (1784&#150;1863), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was baptized on 8 February 1784 at Patrick Brompton, Yorkshire, probably the second child of Abraham Smedley, agent to the Dundas family, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Close. His parents had married at Barton St Cuthbert on 25 August 1772, and a daughter, Elizabeth, was baptized at Hornby by Bedale on 20 February 1774. Smedley was destined for the bar but by 1803 he was married and both he and his wife, Melinda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boleyn or Bullen (1783/4&#150;1870), were members of a stock company which, under the management of Thomas Shaftoe Robinson and Robert Henry Franklin, played in a circuit centred on Lincoln. By 1806, when he began an association with the newly built theatre in Burgess Street, Grimsby, that was to last for some thirty-five years, Smedley was himself the manager of a small company which in 1809&#150;10 numbered twelve players, five of whom were women. In many places he utilized &#145;fit-ups&#146;: at Melton Mowbray performances were in auction rooms and at Gainsborough the &#145;theatre&#146; was the great hall of a fourteenth-century manor house; at Rotherham it was a disused chapel. However, Smedley built theatres himself, at Sleaford (in 1824) and at March, and purchased others, at Southwell in 1814 and at Wakefield in 1836.<br>
<br>Smedley was a freemason, initiated in 1809 into St Matthew's Lodge, Barton upon Humber, and was a petitioner in 1812 for the formation of Apollo Lodge, Grimsby. Letters from fellow mason the Revd Dr George Oliver, covering a period of forty years, indicate the importance of masonic connections in ensuring Smedley's having both a licence to play and patronage for his performances. The correspondence also dwells on the threats from rival managers, the sub-letting of Grimsby theatre to supplement Smedley's income, the prospects for a winter season at Grimsby based on the number of vessels laid up in the docks, Methodist opposition to theatrical entertainment, the effect on Smedley's business of agricultural depression, and arrangements for Smedley to put on&#151;anonymously&#151;plays written by Oliver.<br>
<br>Smedley was praised for his &#145;uniform regularity and good conduct&#146;  (Lincolnshire County Archives, LLHS 38/9/3/2), and for his firm control over the members of his company. He was &#145;a tragedian on stage but off it a dandified gentleman, full of self-confidence and importance&#146;  (Scruton, 128). His playbills regularly included moralizing comments and his evening's entertainment, the conventional double bill of the period, was described in the <span class="italic">Wakefield and West Riding Herald</span> as &#145;unlikely to disturb the most fastidious puritan&#146;  (20 Nov 1835). Financially sound, but never greatly prosperous, he advised others on the money to be made from creating a billiard room under the stage and sub-letting theatre buildings for non-theatrical events.<br>
<br>Six of Smedley's children&#151;four daughters and two sons&#151;joined the company: he had at least two other sons. In the 1830s he concentrated increasingly on the growing towns of the industrial West Riding, including Barnsley, Bradford, Huddersfield, Rotherham, and Wakefield. He rarely engaged stars and had a repertory in which plays by Shakespeare, Sheridan, and Elizabeth Inchbald and adaptations of the novels of Dickens and Scott featured prominently. In 1841 Smedley gave up theatre management and settled in New Sleaford, Lincolnshire, where he set up in business as a printer and bookseller and where, in North Street, he died of typhus on 1 March 1863.<br>
<br>Between 1806 and 1841, in a period when evangelical opposition had a considerable effect on theatre audiences, Smedley had maintained what was perhaps the most extensive (in terms of both distance and the number of places where his companies performed) of provincial itineraries, having in 1833 the management of theatres in at least eighteen towns in Derbyshire, Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Yorkshire.<br>
