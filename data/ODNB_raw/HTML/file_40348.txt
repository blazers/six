<span class="headword">Morrison, Sir  (William) Murray</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">metallurgist and electrical engineer</span>, was born on 7 October 1873 at Birchwood, Lower Drummond, Inverness, the younger child of William Morrison (<i>b</i>. 1841/1844), wood merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Marjory, daughter of Charles Innes, solicitor. Educated at Inverness College in 1889 he went to Edinburgh University to study natural philosophy; in 1892&#150;3 he attended the West of Scotland Technical College, Glasgow. He trained at various engineering works in Glasgow, and then began a career in the aluminium industry.<br>
<br>British Aluminium was established in May 1894 to extract the metal by using electricity generated at the Falls of Foyers, Inverness-shire, through the new Hall&#150;Herrault process, and, at twenty, Morrison, whose maternal grandfather was associated with the company, joined it as its first engineer. Lord Kelvin, later joint technical adviser to British Aluminium with Morrison, who became a personal friend, designed some of the equipment. The process was imperfectly understood, but Morrison improved it by trial and error. On 15 June 1896 Foyers opened, and within a year it was producing one tenth of the world's aluminium. When it closed in 1967 much of the original equipment was still in use, a testimony to the conception and execution of the scheme.<br>
<br>After 1904 Morrison worked on Kinlochleven, six times bigger than Foyers, which involved building a village, a huge reservoir, a power plant, and a smelter. The complex opened in 1908, in a remote Scottish glen, and in that year Morrison became general manager and sole technical adviser. On 13 June 1913 he married, in London (where the company had its headquarters), Marie Vera Markel (<i>b</i>. 1887/8), the daughter of Dr K. E. Markel, a chemist. The Morrisons, who had one daughter, lived in London, in Kent, and later in Norfolk, though Murray remained dedicated to things Scottish: he was a collector, a skating and curling enthusiast, and a member of the Clan Moriston Society.<br>
<br>After 1924 Morrison worked on the great Lochaber scheme. This involved the then longest tunnel of its kind in the world, under the foot of Ben Nevis, which was inaugurated by his wife. The scheme was opened in December 1929, expanded by 1938, and completed in 1943, and involved Canadian troops. Morrison became managing director of British Aluminium in 1927 and deputy chairman in 1934. He was largely responsible for technically innovative, socially ambitious, and, at times, controversial projects, for solving scientific problems and negotiating with the powerful interests affected, and for drafting the acts of parliament which transformed the landscape and economy of the highlands.<br>
<br>Morrison became associated with production in Norway in 1907 when British Aluminium established reduction facilities at Stangfjord and Kristiansand. In recognition of this he was created commander of the order of St Olav in 1933. He was acknowledged as a leading authority in other countries, and at home he gave valuable evidence to government committees investigating hydro-electric power. He was associated with the construction of factories for the production of alumina at Burntisland, Fife, in 1918, which was convenient for the company's operations in both Scotland and Norway, and at Newport, Monmouthshire, in 1938; he also helped to establish a state-of-the-art rolling mill, essential to the war effort, at Falkirk in 1944. He was knighted in 1943.<br>
<br>Morrison had charm, foresight, judgement, and energy. He was essentially a practical man whose expertise spanned several disciplines: he was a founder member of the Institute of Metals, a council member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a vice-president of the Faraday Society, a fellow of the Institute of Physics, and an early advocate of the National Physical Laboratory. When the Institute of Metals honoured him in 1942 with its platinum medal he first paid tribute to his collaborators. Morrison retired in 1947. He died of cancer at his home, 29 Bramham Gardens, Kensington, London, on 21 May 1948, and was cremated. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Through his outstanding scientific and managerial abilities Sir Murray Morrison established the industrial use of hydro-electric power in the highlands and significantly developed economical ways of extracting aluminium, previously a rare metal. According to an obituary, not only was he responsible for the creation of a new Scottish industry, but &#145;The ramifications of that enterprise spread through half the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chemical Age</span>, 5 June 1948).<br>
