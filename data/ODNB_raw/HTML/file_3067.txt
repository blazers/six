<span class="headword">Bowler,  Thomas William</span>  (1812&#150;1869), <span class="occ">landscape painter and printmaker</span>, was born in Tring, Hertfordshire, on 9 December 1812, the son of William Bowler, a labourer, and Sarah Butterfield. He worked for three years in London as a solicitor's clerk, but in 1833, on the recommendation of a local squire, Dr John Lee FRS, who had noticed his talents, he obtained a post as servant and assistant to Thomas Maclear, newly appointed astronomer royal at the Cape of Good Hope. He was employed at the Cape Town observatory from 1834 until July 1835, when he was dismissed. Until 1838 he was tutor to the children of Captain Richard Wolfe, commandant of the prison settlement on Robben Island in Table Bay. He subsequently established himself successfully in Cape Town as a landscape painter and drawing-master; he taught at the South African College (1842&#150;66) and the Diocesan College. He was self-taught as an artist, but in 1854, on a visit to Britain, he studied under James Duffield Harding; in 1857 he published <span class="italic">The Students Hand-Book Intended for those Studying Art, on the System of J. D. Harding</span>, the first book on the subject to be produced in South Africa.<br>
<br>Influenced by the early works of J. M. W. Turner, Bowler painted sea-, land-, and townscapes, notably a panorama of the Cape Town district (1852); many of his works were purchased by visitors to the Cape. He published <span class="italic">Four Views of Cape Town</span> (1844); <span class="italic">South African Sketches</span> (1854), a series of ten lithographs of scenes at the Cape of Good Hope; <span class="italic">The African Sketch Book</span> (1855); and <span class="italic">The Kafir Wars and British Settlers in South Africa</span> (1865), a series of twenty views, with descriptive letterpress by W. R. Thomson. He was a committee member of the Cape Town Exhibitions of Fine Arts (1850&#150;59) and won a gold medal at the first exhibition in 1851; he introduced the Art Union of London to the Cape (1851) and became its first secretary in 1853. He received an honourable mention at the British Institution (1857); he also exhibited a drawing of the Royal Observatory, Cape Town, at the Society of British Artists (1857) and two views of Cape scenery at the Royal Academy (1860). Many of his sketches were published as wood-engravings in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>.<br>
<br>In 1838 Bowler married Jane Hawthorne, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. His wife died in 1849, and on 26 February 1851 he married Maria Jolly; they had four daughters. He travelled widely in the Cape and Natal, and in 1866 and 1868 visited Mauritius, where he made a number of drawings, but the malaria he caught there weakened his health. He died of bronchitis at the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 24 October 1869. Bowler executed some 800 watercolours, a few oils, and numerous lithographs; there are examples of his work in the Africana Museum, Johannesburg, and the William Fehr collection, Cape Town.<br>
