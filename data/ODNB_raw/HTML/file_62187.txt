<span class="headword">Villiers,  Susan Alice</span>  (1863&#150;1945), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 6 September 1863 at Chase Vale, Edmonton, Middlesex, the eighth of the nine children of John Fitzpatrick Villiers (1815/16&#150;1874), barrister-at-law of Gray's Inn, and his wife, Mary Ann(e) (<i>bap</i>. 1825, <i>d</i>. 1899), daughter of William Sharp, a farmer of Upwell, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Mary. The product of a middle class family, she was privately educated. However, the death of her father in 1874 appears to have strained the family's finances. By 1892 she was twenty-eight and perhaps regarded as a confirmed spinster; it was therefore appropriate for her to support herself in a career suitable to her station in life. In May that year she commenced three years of general nurse training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Probably because of her social class she began as a special probationer. However, in November 1892 she became an ordinary probationer, which enabled her to benefit from a wider range of experience. She qualified in April 1895 and was appointed staff nurse at Bart's in May, working in that capacity until she resigned in March 1896.<br>
<br>Various factors are likely to have influenced Susan Villiers's decision to specialize in fever nursing. Infectious diseases were still rife, although mortality rates were mostly declining. The growth of fever (or isolation) hospitals necessitated large numbers of nurses who required leadership. Susan Villiers's comprehensive nurse training, which included work on a diphtheria ward, gave her an insight into the skilled care necessary. She may also have been influenced by her matron at Bart's, Isla Stewart, who believed that employment with the Metropolitan Asylums Board was the best possible school for matrons. She herself had been matron of two asylums board institutions, a tented smallpox camp at Darenth, Dartford, Kent (1885&#150;6), and the Eastern Fever Hospital, Homerton, East London (1886&#150;7). Susan Villiers therefore knew that there was tremendous potential for advancement in asylums board hospitals, and it was within their large fever institutions in London that she spent her whole career and became a leader of the fever nurses. She went on to hold appointments as night superintendent at the South Eastern Hospital (1896&#150;9) and assistant matron at the Brook Hospital (1899&#150;1901) before becoming matron at the Fountain Hospital (1901&#150;10), the Park Hospital (1910&#150;13), and the South Western Hospital (1913&#150;27).<br>
<br>Between 1861 and 1891, 353 new public isolation hospitals were created in England and Wales. Although they varied tremendously in size, they experienced comparable problems of recruitment and retention of nurses. The main solution to this was seen as fever nurse training. A few hospitals had established courses, but they varied in length, content, and clinical experience. This led to the recognition that standardization was necessary. Susan Villiers was a key figure in fever nurse training from 1908 to 1937. In June 1908 she was appointed to the first council of the Fever Nurses' Association, a new body established in January 1908 to provide a unified system of fever nurse training in British hospitals approved by the association. Moreover, she was determined to ensure the rights of fever nurse members in their conditions of work, and in obtaining special recognition for those with both fever and general training under state registration. She was in an ideal position to implement the association scheme after its approval by the asylums board in July 1909. Following the <span class="roman">Nurses Registration Act</span>, 1919, the General Nursing Council for England and Wales was established. A general register of nurses was opened in which she was the seventh entry, while the supplementary register of fever nurses records her name as the 60th entry. As the fever nurse representative to the council, 1920&#150;37, she served on various committees and contributed to its decision to adopt the association scheme virtually unchanged.<br>
<br>Susan Villiers's commitments were wide ranging. She was one of three representatives of the Matrons' Council of Great Britain and Ireland to the National Council of Women of Great Britain, where she served on the public health sectional committee (1926&#150;7). She became a member of the British College of Nursing in 1926. This new organization was established on 29 April that year by Mrs Bedford Fenwick, matron of Bart's (1881&#150;7) and the chief protagonist of state registration. It was intended to be a rival to the College of Nursing set up in 1916; both had similar educational and professional aims. Although not a militant feminist, Susan Villiers quietly supported the interests and rights of women. In 1927, for instance, she represented the British College of Nursing in support of equal suffrage at the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, formerly the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She was a serene, dignified, ladylike person with a charming manner. By conviction she was an Anglican. In 1935 she became the superior of the Guild of St Barnabas, an Anglican organization which gave spiritual support to nurses.<br>
<br>In retirement Susan Villiers, who remained unmarried, lived first at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where she was a county magistrate for Stevenage petty sessional division. Towards the end of her life she moved to Little Nutcombe, Portsmouth Road, Shottermill, Hindhead, Surrey, where she died on 29 March 1945. She was buried on 3 April at St Alban's Church, Hindhead. A very well attended requiem mass on 12 April at St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, London, was organized by the Guild of St Barnabas&#151;a celebration of her life's work and particularly of her contribution to fever nursing.<br>
