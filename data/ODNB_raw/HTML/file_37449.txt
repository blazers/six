<span class="headword">George V</span>  (1819&#150;1878), <span class="occ">king of Hanover</span>, was born George Frederick Alexander Charles Ernest Augustus in Berlin on 27 May 1819, and was thus three days younger than his cousin, Queen Victoria. He was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8840/', "Ernest Augustus")</script> (fifth son of George III), first duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale (1771&#150;1851), and his wife, Friederike Caroline Sophia Alexandrina of Solms-Braunfels (1778&#150;1841). Ernest Augustus succeeded his brother, William IV, as King Ernst August of Hanover in 1837. Most of Prince George's boyhood was spent at Kew where, in March 1833, he lost the sight of both eyes after an unexplained accident. On 18 February 1843 he married Princess Mary Alexandrina (Marie) (1818&#150;1907), daughter of Joseph, duke of Saxe-Altenburg. They had a son, Ernest Augustus William Adolphus George Frederick (1845&#150;1923), and two daughters, of whom the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95950/', "Frederica")</script>, later supported her father's campaign for the restoration of Hanover following its annexation by Prussia. Prince George acceded to the throne of Hanover upon his father's death, on 18 November 1851, whereupon he also became second duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in the British peerage.<br>
<br>Bismarck, received in audience two years later, left a vivid, pitiless account in his memoirs of the blind king's handling of government business, without a minister in attendance, in a study &#145;littered with every imaginable kind of public and private papers&#146;. In 1866 loyalty to the German confederation made George V side with Austria and oppose Prussia in the contest for German primacy. He was present when his troops repelled the Prussians at Langensalza but, within a few days, his kingdom was overrun and he escaped to Austria. From Hietzing he protested in vain at Prussia's annexation of Hanover and the sequestration of his estates. He never abdicated.<br>
<br>The king's last years were spent in Paris, the tedium of exile relieved by the pleasures of music; he died there suddenly on 12 June 1878, after a drive through the Bois de Boulogne. He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 January 1907 at Gmunden, Austria. To avoid political embarrassment Queen Victoria had discouraged her cousin from settling in England but, as a prince of Great Britain, he was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor, where his Garter banner had hung since 1835. His son, Ernest Augustus, resumed the title of duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, as third duke; but as an officer in the Austrian army he was considered to have borne arms against the United Kingdom during the First World War, and lost his peerage in 1919 under the terms of the <span class="roman">Titles Deprivation Act</span> (1917).<br>
