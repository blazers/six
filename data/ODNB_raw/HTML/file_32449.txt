<span class="headword">Clifford,  Frederick</span>  (1828&#150;1904), <span class="occ">journalist and legal writer</span>, was born at Gillingham, Kent, on 22 June 1828, the fifth son of Jesse Clifford and his wife, Mary Pearse. After private schooling he engaged in provincial journalism, but settled in London in 1852, and joined the parliamentary staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, of which his elder brother George was already a member. He retained his connection with the provinces by acting as London correspondent of the <span class="italic">Sheffield Daily Telegraph</span>, and in 1863 he became its joint proprietor with William Christopher Leng (1825&#150;1902). In 1866 he went to Jamaica to report for <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the royal commission of inquiry into the conduct of the governor, Edward Eyre. He helped in 1868 to found the Press Association, an institution formed to supply newspaper proprietors of London and the provinces with home and foreign news, and he acted as chairman of the committee of management during two periods of five years each, finally retiring in 1880. In 1877, owing to the failing health of the editor, John Thaddeus Delane, Clifford was transferred by <span class="italic">The Times</span> from the reporters' gallery of the House of Commons to the central offices at Printing House Square, and he acted as assistant editor until his health obliged him to resign in 1883.<br>
<br>Clifford also pursued a career as a legal writer. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 3 November 1856, and was called to the bar on 10 June 1859. With Pembroke S. Stephens KC, he published <span class="italic">The Practice of the Court of Referees on Private Bills in Parliament</span> (1870), which became the standard textbook on the subject. It also brought him work at the parliamentary bar. The historical aspect of the practice especially interested him, and he later published <span class="italic">The History of Private Bill Legislation</span> (2 vols., 1885&#150;7). This was a valuable and painstaking account, which revealed the largely public aims of private bill legislation over the course of more than three centuries. It remained the most significant work in its field until O. C. William's <span class="italic">Historical Development of Private Bill Procedure</span> (1948). Clifford took silk in 1894, and was elected a bencher of his inn on 18 May 1900.<br>
<br>Early in his career Clifford co-operated with Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Dickens, and other men of letters and artists in forming the Guild of Literature and Art, which was incorporated by private act of parliament in 1858. Clifford was a member of the council. The guild did not succeed in its aims, and Clifford and Sir John Richard Robinson, the last surviving members of the council, wound up its affairs in 1897. Clifford was an active member of the Royal Botanic Society, and a student of agricultural questions, publishing <span class="italic">The Agricultural Lockout of 1874</span> (1875) and a small treatise on the <span class="roman">Agricultural Holdings Act</span> of 1875 (1876). He was also a collector of fans and other works of art.<br>
<br>Clifford married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1900), third daughter of Thomas Mason of Hull, in 1853. He died at his residence, 24 Collingham Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 30 December 1904; four sons and two daughters survived him. His library formed a three days' sale at Sothebys (5&#150;7 May 1905).<br>
