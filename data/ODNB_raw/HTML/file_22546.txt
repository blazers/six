<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pordage,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">religious leader and physician</span>, was baptized on 21 April 1607 in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, London, the eldest son of Samuel Pordage (<i>d</i>. 1627), citizen and grocer, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1657), daughter of Thomas Francknell, citizen and goldsmith. A merchant with contacts in the City, Norfolk, and abroad, Samuel Pordage was, for his diligent action against malefactors, rewarded by the court of aldermen in May 1619.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>John Pordage was admitted a pensioner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 21 April 1623, and matriculated on 3 July. Upon petition to the Grocers' Company his father secured for him an exhibition valued at &pound;5 per annum. Pordage graduated BA in 1626. The previous November, Samuel Pordage was admitted as one of the marshals of the City of London, for which he received an annual salary of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., but his death in an accident in March 1627 reduced his family to poverty. With seven children to support, his widow, Elizabeth, petitioned the court of aldermen and the Grocers' Company for relief. In July 1627 the Grocers' Company granted 5 marks to her son John to buy books but shortly after his father's death he seems to have left his studies at Cambridge. Again following petitions from his mother, in March 1630 he was awarded 20 nobles by the Grocers' Company towards the expenses of attaining his master's degree and later that year he was awarded an exhibition worth &pound;5 a year by the Skinners' Company. However, he left the university before proceeding MA. On 17 January 1633, described as a gentleman of St Dionis Backchurch, London, he was licensed to marry Mary [<a name="cosubject_69335"></a><span class="headword">Mary Pordage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1668)<span class="occ"></span>], widow of William Freeman of St Clement Eastcheap, and daughter of one Lane, probably of Tetbury, Gloucestershire. They were married that day at St Gregory by St Paul's, London. Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22547/', "Samuel Pordage (d. in or after 1691)")</script>, was baptized on 29 December 1633 at St Dionis Backchurch.<h2>
<a name="Unlicensedmedicalpractice"></a>Unlicensed medical practice</h2>In 1634 Samuel Hartlib noted that John Davenport, vicar of St Stephen, Coleman Street, had preached against &#145;one Pordage&#146; who &#145;broches new-fangled opinions concerning the signes, that No Man can trie himself by them, but was to stay by for an over-powring light&#146;  (Sheffield University Library, HP 29/2/40B). It appears that about this time Pordage also began to practise medicine in London without a licence. In June 1637 a complaint was made to the College of Physicians against &#145;one Pordage pretended Dr. of physique&#146; dwelling in Barbican. Pordage, it was alleged, had prescribed harmful medicines to a patient in the form of &#145;powders&#146;  (annals, RCP Lond., 3.170<i>v</i>). In January 1638 he appeared before the college desiring licence to practise, but upon examination he confessed that its statutes already barred him since he was in deacons' orders, was chaplain to Mary, Lady Vere, and had preached on several occasions. Undeterred, Pordage nevertheless applied himself to the study of medicine. On 9 August 1639 he was admitted as a candidate in medicine at Leiden University and allowed to dispute for the degree of doctor of medicine (doubtless to legitimize his calling). On 11 August, the degree of MD was conferred on him. It may have been during his stay in the United Provinces that Pordage became acquainted with John Durie, the Scots ecumenist: Durie was to write from Amsterdam that he had done what Pordage and &#145;Dr Boot [Arnold or Gerard Boate] did require of me in their businesse&#146;  (Sheffield University Library, HP 2/5/5A). After returning to England, Pordage was incorporated MD at Cambridge on 10 October. The following year he was given official reference letters testifying to his degree.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1640 Pordage appeared once again before the College of Physicians and confessed that he had practised medicine for six years and that he was in holy orders. Once again the college denied him licence to practise. The following month, Pordage appeared before the college charged with letting blood in a patient suffering from the final stages of fever. He was further charged with prescribing a vomit made from an infusion of crocus mettalorum, a cordial, and an aperient apozem. The patient responded to this treatment by breaking out into cold sweats, voiding &#145;many stooles&#146;, and dying  (annals, RCP Lond., 3.210<i>r</i>). Pordage was judged guilty of malpractice but had clearly been making a profitable living. In 1642 he invested &pound;100 in Irish land (his name appears in a list of adventurers above that of his brother-in-law, Henry Faldoe, haberdasher of London).<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwar"></a>The civil war</h2>In May 1643 Pordage was appointed physician to Colonel John Venn's regiment. He was stationed at the garrison in Windsor Castle, where Christopher Love (1618&#150;1651) was minister. Pordage's annual salary was to be &pound;60, though by his own account a considerable sum was to remain in arrears; small recompense, perhaps, for frequently venturing his life &#145;by daily visiting the common souldiers that had the plague-sores on them&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 18/97/30 II). Pordage probably served as physician to Venn's regiment until autumn 1644. Thereafter, according to John Etherington, a one-time boxmaker, Pordage went to Reading in expectation of the &#145;chief publike place there&#146;. Etherington, who had himself been denounced as a sectary, added that Pordage had &#145;taught the doctrine&#146; of Henrick Nicleas (1502?&#150;1580?), publicly &#145;in the midst&#146; of London  (Etherington, 10). The charge was to foreshadow accusations that Pordage preached blasphemous tenets.<br>
<br>In autumn 1644 Pordage began officiating at the parish church of St Lawrence, Reading. He was to serve as minister there for more than two years, receiving an annual salary of &pound;50; a payment made to him in November 1646 described him as vicar. Afterwards Pordage was appointed by the committee for plundered ministers to the sequestered rectory of Bradfield, Berkshire, and arrived to find that the parsonage, garden, and outhouses were in a state of disrepair  (TNA: PRO, SP 18/97/30 II). His son Benjamin was baptized in the parish on 1 April 1647.<h2>
<a name="BehmenismandBradfieldBerkshire"></a>Behmenism and Bradfield, Berkshire</h2>In 1649 Giles Calvert issued a work by &#145;M.P.&#146; entitled <span class="italic">The Mystery of the Deity in the Humanity, or, The Mystery of God in Man</span>. The author of this tract wrote vividly of the &#145;burning fiery flames of the Nature of his Godhead&#146;. Elsewhere, the &#145;silly damosel&#146; envisaged the Godhead as &#145;the Fountain, from whence all honor and justice flows into this center man&#146;, suggesting a Behmenist vision of the deity  (sigs. A2<i>v</i>, A4<i>r</i>, p. 12). In the eighteenth century Richard Roach observed that it was from some of the &#145;Inward Mystical way in England&#146; that the Philadelphian Society arose, and he attributed the &#145;fresh Concurence &amp; Holy Gale of a Divine Life &amp; Power&#146;, which accompanied it, as occurring &#145;first &amp; Principally in Mrs Pordage wife of John Pordage Doctor in Physick: who married her for ye Ex[c]ellent Gift of God he found in her&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 833, fols. 63<i>v</i>&#150;64<i>r</i>). It seems that Mary Pordage may have been the author of <span class="italic">The Mystery of the Deity</span>.<br>
<br>About the time of its publication a sermon was delivered by John Pordage at Ilsley, Berkshire, in which Pordage paraphrased <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 9: 24, saying in effect, &#145;That the imputative righteousness of another, was a sapless righteousness to all those that had no right or interest in it&#146;  (Pordage, 6). Among his hearers at Ilsley was John Tickell, who reproved him for maintaining this. Tickell also censured Pordage for declaring that: &#145;the fiery deity of Christ did mingle and mixe it selfe with our flesh, and was in the center of our Soules, burning and consuming&#146;  (Tickell, To the reader). Following the conclusion of his sermon Pordage entered into debate with John Pendarves (1622&#150;1656) concerning the question &#145;whether Christ was a Type or no?&#146;, to which Pordage answered in the affirmative. He also, as he later confessed, said that &#145;the common gifts and graces of the Spirit were but flesh&#146;  (Pordage, 7).<br>
<br>On 16 August 1649 Pordage appeared at Reading before Berkshire county committee charged with blasphemy &#145;against Christ, God the Son&#146;  (Pordage, 6). In the presence of the committee's chairman, Daniel Blagrave, a &#145;hot dispute&#146; ensued between Pordage and Tickell about the nature of blasphemy during which Pordage uttered the &#145;bare&#146; expressions &#145;That Christ is not God, That Christ is not Jehovah&#146; (Fowler, 51; Pordage, 5). After examining witnesses on both sides the committee ordered Pordage to preach at St Lawrence, Reading. In this sermon Pordage attempted to vindicate himself from &#145;the horrid imputation of denying the Godhead of Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Truth Appearing</span>, 2). He was judged &#145;innocent in that particular&#146; and cleared by vote of the committee  (Pordage, 49).<br>
<br>About this time Pordage began receiving a number of visitors at Bradfield. One alleged guest was Richard Coppin, to whose &#145;erroneous and blasphemous&#146; book, <span class="italic">Divine Teachings</span> (1649), Pordage &#145;gave his approbation&#146; (Coppin, 18; Fowler, 61). Other callers included the prophet Elizabeth Poole, and the Baptist preacher Abiezer Coppe whose heterodox opinions became notorious. William Everard, previously an acknowledged leader of the &#145;True Levellers&#146;, was often at Pordage's house and in the summer of 1650 he stayed in Bradfield in the guise of a harvest worker. During this time &#145;many strange and wonderfull apparitions&#146; were seen in Pordage's house  (Pordage, 25). Then on Sunday 1 September 1650 a thirteen-year-old boy named William Snelling &#145;fell into a very strange Fit, foaming at the mouth for the space of two hours&#146;  (<span class="italic">A most Faithful Relation of Two Wonderful Passages</span>, 4). When at last the boy began to speak he recited mysterious verses proclaiming the Great Jehovah. The following Sunday, while preaching in the parish church, Pordage &#145;fell into a Trance, running out of the Church, and bellowing like a Bull, saying that he was called, and must be gon&#146;. After retiring to his parsonage, Pordage found his wife upstairs, &#145;Cloathed all in White Lawne, from the crown of the Head, to the sole of the Foot, with a White Rod in her hand&#146;  (ibid., 2). The next day &#145;a very mournfull cry&#146; was heard in the parsonage, &#145;as if it had been one in extream pains&#146;  (Pordage, 18). It seems likely that Pordage, Everard, and Theaurau John Tany, the self-proclaimed Lord's high priest of the Jews, were all at Bradfield parsonage in early September. Local suspicions, however, pointed to Everard, a reputed &#145;Conjurer&#146;  (ibid., 9), and a man &#145;suspected to be a Sorcerer or Witch&#146;, as the malefic presence in the parsonage. Shortly after, Everard was seen in a &#145;frantick posture&#146; in London, where he was eventually apprehended and committed to Bridewell  (<span class="italic">A most Faithful Relation</span>, 4). As Pordage observed in his sermon on Sunday 29 September, Bradfield had become a place made partly famous, &#145;partly infamous, by reason of the false and lying reports that are abroad&#146;  (Pordage, 28).<br>
<br>However, Everard and Tany were not the only visitors to Bradfield in early September 1650, for inside a horoscope cast on 30 August the astrologer and botanist Elias Ashmole had recorded the time he came to Bradfield. It is suggestive that the next day Ashmole noted the time he first saw Dr William Currer, a Leiden-educated iatrochemical physician. Ashmole was married to Mary, Lady Mainwaring, widowed daughter of Sir William Forster, who held jointure house and lands in Bradfield, but such were Ashmole's difficulties with his wife's relations that in October 1650 he contemplated leasing her estate to Pordage. That the most important witness to the &#145;wonderful&#146; events at Bradfield in early September 1650 was William Forster, a relative of Ashmole's wife, may be more than coincidental.<br>
<br>At an unknown date a number of articles were presented against Pordage before the committee for plundered ministers. Among the allegations were that he preached that Christ was not God, but only a type, that his imputative righteousness was unefficacious, and that &#145;the fiery Deity of Christ mingles and mixeth it self with our flesh&#146;  (Pordage, 5&#150;7). He was further charged with giving a rabbinical interpretation to <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 1: 27, that: &#145;By male we are to understand &hellip; The Deity, by the female, the Humanity&#146;  (ibid., 44). However, on 27 March 1651 the committee for plundered ministers, after a thorough investigation, acquitted him.<br>
<br>Pordage had survived two attempts to remove him from his ministry, yet still he continued to expound his allegorical interpretations of scripture. Some of the sermons he preached at Bradfield during this period concerned Christ's birth (<span class="roman">Matthew</span> 1: 23), the Word made flesh (<span class="roman">John</span> 1: 14), and the &#145;inward&#146; household of Abraham (<span class="roman">Genesis</span> 18: 19). This last was particularly resonant, for Pordage had established a &#145;Family&#146; community at Bradfield whose members adopted biblical names: he was Father Abraham, his wife was Deborah, and a follower named Mary Pocock was Rahab. This community was to be joined by Thomas Bromley (1630&#150;1691) and Edmund Brice (<i>b</i>. 1632, <i>d</i>. in or after 1696), two members of Oxford University who heard Pordage preach a powerful sermon at St Mary's, the university church. Another associate was Philip Herbert, fifth earl of Pembroke (1619&#150;1669). Pordage and his &#145;Family&#146; were said to have cried down &#145;flesh &amp; carnal Relations&#146; and appear to have objected to the lawfulness of marriage  (DWL, Baxter MS, Treatises, III 67, fol. 302<i>v</i>). Theirs was a Behmenist universe, consisting of a dark world (<i>mundus tenebrosus</i>) and a light world (<i>mundus luminosus</i>)&#151;a cosmos populated by good and evil angels visible to the &#145;inward eye&#146;  (Pordage, 75).<h2>
<a name="Ejectionprotestsandsettlement"></a>Ejection, protests, and settlement</h2>On 28 February 1654 Simon Ford, vicar of St Lawrence, Reading, preached a sermon at Reading assizes. Alluding to Pordage he claimed that one of the &#145;most eminent Church-Livings&#146; in Berkshire was &#145;possessed by a blasphemer&#146;  (S. Ford, <span class="italic">Primitiae regiminis Davidici</span>, 1654, 26). The living of Bradfield was indeed lucrative (it was valued at about &pound;300 per annum in 1654) and Ford's sermon seems to have signalled the start of a locally orchestrated campaign to oust Pordage. On 18 September Pordage was issued with a summons to appear before the newly appointed commissioners for ejecting scandalous ministers for the county of Berkshire to answer articles exhibited against him. As the trial progressed over the autumn Pordage's enemies set about tightening the noose. The old charges against him were revived, further articles exhibited, and witnesses examined upon oath. Then on Friday 8 December, after several hearings at Speenhamland and Reading, Pordage was found guilty of &#145;denying the Deity of Christ, and the merit of his bloud and passion&#146;. He was condemned as &#145;Ignorant and very Insufficient for the Work of the Ministry&#146; and ejected out of the rectory of Bradfield  (Pordage, 96).<br>
<br>After his ejection Pordage went to London and petitioned Oliver Cromwell for justice, while his supporters issued a pamphlet &#145;clearly evincing the unjustness and illegality&#146; of his sentence  (<span class="italic">Truth Appearing</span>, title-page). Several weeks later John Sadler, master of requests, delivered Pordage's petition to the lord protector. Cromwell referred the matter to the council of state, which, after some debate, rejected it. Pordage then published a vindication of his conduct, <span class="italic">Innocencie Appearing Through the Dark Mists of Pretended Guilt</span> (1655). At about the same time he petitioned the protector again. The matter was again referred to the council of state, which in turn referred it to a committee. They advised Cromwell to present a new incumbent and recommended that Pordage be allowed &pound;80 per annum out of the profits of the rectory. This arrangement, however, proved to be unsatisfactory, and on 11 May 1655 it was decreed that Pordage and the new incumbent, Gualter Adams, were each to receive &pound;100 a year from the profits of the rectory during their joint lives. Pordage was also to vacate Bradfield parsonage and deliver up the glebe. Yet that was not to be the end of the affair. On 27 July 1655, after Adams had prudently declined to take up the living and Pordage had petitioned the protector yet again, it was further ordered that Pordage be given leave to reap his harvest and gather the arrears due to him before he was ejected.<h2>
<a name="Dissenter"></a>Dissenter</h2>Pordage continued to live at Bradfield for many years, though how long he remained at the parsonage is unknown. According to the antiquary Anthony Wood, Pordage was restored to the living after Charles II returned from exile. This seems doubtful, for the sequestered incumbent, Richard Bayly, was to be restored to the living upon petition. Indeed, a payment made to Pordage in 1663 suggests that he may have reverted to practising medicine. Between 1662 and 1664 Pordage occupied a dwelling in Bradfield assessed at five hearths; perhaps this was Ashmole House, an apparently &#145;old &amp; smoaky&#146; abode where he later resided  (TNA: PRO, C 5/60/15). This property yielded an estimated annual profit of &pound;60 from the produce of the lands and gardens. After some structural repairs Pordage agreed to sell the place for &pound;775. The purchaser, however, reneged on this agreement, obliging Pordage to bring a lawsuit in the court of king's bench, and the purchaser a writ of error in the court of exchequer and a counter-suit in the court of chancery.<br>
<br>In October 1663 Pordage began attending both divine service and sermons at Bradfield. How long he had been absent from church is unknown, but it is clear that he continued to dissent from the Restoration church. In the episcopal returns of 1669 he and Thomas Bromley were suspected of holding a conventicle at Bradfield. Pordage, moreover, was reportedly the teacher of two conventicles in Reading frequented by &#145;tradesmen of every parish of the towne, &amp; neere, w<sup>th</sup> their wives &amp; families&#146;  (G. L. Turner, ed., <span class="italic">Records of Early Nonconformity under Persecution and Indulgence</span>, 3 vols., 1911, 1.113). Nor were his activities confined to Berkshire. During the plague of 1665 Pordage and his &#145;Family&#146; were apparently in London, though in the fire that followed in September 1666 only Pordage &#145;staid to sett his house, and had not remov'd his goods, the greatest part of which were devour'd and involv'd in the common calamity&#146;  (M. Nicolson, ed., <span class="italic">The Conway Letters</span>, revised edn, 1992, 279). 1666 was also the year that Pordage became acquainted with John Sparrow, an Essex gentleman who had translated many of the works of Jacob Boehme from German into English. Another intimate acquaintance was said to have been Oliver Hill (<i>b</i>. 1630?, <i>d</i>. after 1702), who was elected to the Royal Society in 1677 but then elbowed out because of his arcane views.<h2>
<a name="FamiliarfriendshipwithJaneLeadandreputation"></a>Familiar friendship with Jane Lead and reputation</h2>Mary Pordage died in 1668 and was buried at Bradfield on 25 August. Richard Roach remarked that after her decease Pordage was joined in his work by Mistress Jane Lead, &#145;whose Extraordinary gift of Revelatio[n] the Dr gave great Regard to &amp; Attendance upon&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 833, fol. 64<i>v</i>). Her future son-in-law Francis Lee placed the beginning of their &#145;familiar friendship&#146; in August 1673 or 1674, though this seemingly contradicts Lead's own statement that she first became acquainted with Pordage in 1663. Her published testimony may have been incorrectly transcribed.<br>
<br>As a physician now living in London in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn, Pordage drew up his will on 28 November 1681. To Thomas Bromley he bequeathed money for a mourning ring. Elizabeth Douglas, Elizabeth Blagrave, Jane Lead, and Pordage's daughter Sarah were the witnesses. A few days before his death and in some agony, Pordage called for Jane Lead. As a gentleman from Red Lyon Fields he was buried in the parish church of St Andrew's, Holborn, on 11 December. Writing to Anthony Wood in May 1686, Elias Ashmole denied knowledge of Pordage's death and burial, but commended him &#145;for his knowledge in, or at least his great affection to, astronomy&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1100). John Aubrey described Pordage as a &#145;physitian &amp; astrologer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives, Chiefly of Contemporaries, Set Down by John Aubrey</span>, ed. A. Clark, 2 vols., 1898, 2.161). In Richard Baxter's opinion Pordage and his &#145;Family&#146; were the leading Behmenists in England. Pordage was survived by six children: Samuel; John (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;1688), physician and author; William (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1639, <i>d</i>. in or after 1691); Benjamin (1647&#150;1698); Sarah; and Abigail (<i>d</i>. in or after 1697). Two daughters had predeceased him: Mary (<i>d</i>. 1670), wife of Ellis Crispe, citizen and haberdasher of London, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1663).<h2>
<a name="Legacy"></a>Legacy</h2>In his last years Pordage wrote a number of treatises. Although none of the original texts appear to have survived, manuscript copies of some of these works circulated both during and after his lifetime. Shortly after his death and apparently at his behest, Edward Hooker published <span class="italic">The Archetypal Globe</span>, an abbreviated version of Pordage's untitled work, together with Pordage's treatise <span class="italic">Of Eternal Nature</span> (1671) under the title <span class="italic">Theologia mystica, or, The Mystic Divinitie of the Aeternal Invisibles</span> (1683). The following titles by Pordage have also been identified: <span class="italic">Sophia: that is the Lovely Eternal Virgin of the Godly Wisdom</span> (1675), <span class="italic">Of the Spirit of Faith and from the Various Arts and Degrees of Belief</span> (1676), <span class="italic">Experimental Discoveries, Concerning Union of Natures, of Essences, Tinctures, of Bodies, of Persons, and of Spirits</span> (1676), <span class="italic">The Angelical World</span> (no date), <span class="italic">The Dark Fire World</span> (1681), <span class="italic">Of the Paradise</span> (no date), <span class="italic">A Short Abstract and Idea of the Holy English World and of its Spiritual Population</span> (no date), <span class="italic">Of the Newest Birth and Incarnation of Jesus Christ</span> (no date), <span class="italic">Of the Mysticism and Inner Birth and Incarnation of Jesus Christ</span> (no date), <span class="italic">That for so Long a Time Lost but since Rediscovered Secret of History and Revelation</span> (no date), and <span class="italic">A Thorough Philosophical Letter on the Lawful Stones of Wisdom</span> (no date). German translations of many of these treatises, probably by Loth Fischer of Utrecht, were published at Amsterdam between 1698 and 1704, either anonymously or by the Wettstein family. In 1715 a three-volume edition of Pordage's works entitled <span class="italic">G&ouml;ttliche und wahre Metaphysica</span> (<span class="italic">Godly and True Metaphysics</span>) was issued at Frankfurt and Leipzig. Some of Pordage's treatises were also translated into Russian in the early nineteenth century (these manuscripts are in the Russian state library). Pordage, moreover, appears to have collaborated with his son Samuel in the writing of the Behmenist poem <span class="italic">Mundorum explicatio, or, The Explanation of an Hieroglyphical Figure</span> (1661).<br>
