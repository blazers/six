<span class="headword">Ould, Sir  Fielding</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1789), <span class="occ">man-midwife</span>, was born at Galway, Ireland, one of two children of Captain Ould (1689&#150;<i>c</i>.1715) of the Royal regiment of Welch fusiliers and Lettice Shawe, the daughter of the Revd Fielding Shawe, canon of Tagh Saxon. His father, who fought at the battles of the Boyne and Aughrim, was later assassinated in London, and Fielding and his brother, Abraham, were raised in Galway. Beginning about 1729 Ould spent five years as a dissector in the department of anatomy in Trinity College, Dublin, and attended courses in botany, chemistry, and natural philosophy, but left without a degree. He then studied in Paris under Gregoire the elder, the first Frenchman to give private lessons in midwifery. It was there that Ould made his greatest contribution to obstetrics when he was first to observe that in normal labour the foetal head entered the maternal pelvis in the lateral position and then rotated, prior to delivery. Ould married Gracia Walker in 1733, and they had several children. She was related by marriage to the Chamberlen family, who had introduced the obstetric forceps to midwifery practice in the previous century.<br>
<br>On his return to Dublin in 1736 or 1737 Ould resided at 21 Frederick Street South and developed a large midwifery practice in Golden Lane. He was granted a licence in midwifery by the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, on 16 August 1738, as he was found to be &#145;singularly well qualified&#146; in the art of obstetrics. Four years later his famous book, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Midwifery, in Three Parts</span>, was published. Dedicated to the fellows of the College of Physicians, it also carried their imprimatur. Ould recommended the use of opiates in prolonged labour. He may have possessed a pair of obstetric forceps, and he wrote that &#145;The best adapted instrument is the large forceps, which is in general use all over Europe&#146;. He described episiotomy and cautioned against premature extraction of the placenta. He opposed the use of caesarean section, which he argued would necessarily destroy the mother. His sound judgement and moral courage are evidenced by the fact that he advised professional consultation in difficult obstetric cases. His textbook was one of the first important works on obstetrics in English, and contained many new and important observations, including his original studies on the mechanism of normal labour. His caring attitude is evident throughout the book, as is his commitment to improve the quality of care for women in childbirth.<br>
<br>Ould was appointed assistant master of the Dublin Lying-in Hospital in 1745. In 1753 he received the degree of BA, &#145;speciali gratia&#146; from Trinity College, and three years later applied to Trinity and the College of Physicians to be examined for a bachelor's degree in medicine. The College of Physicians refused as it was contrary to their by-laws, which stated that &#145;no man &hellip; shall have a licence to practise midwifery and physic together&#146;. Trinity, however, conferred an honorary degree in medicine on Ould in 1761, causing the indignant physicians to dissolve their links with the university. Some twenty-four years later they relented and Ould was admitted as a licentiate in medicine of the College of Physicians on 3 October 1785.<br>
<br>In 1759 Ould became master of the lying-in hospital after the untimely death of its founder, Bartholomew Mosse, and devoted himself to lowering maternal mortality and improving patients' welfare and facilities. He proceeded with the building of a place of entertainment and fund-raising, known as the Round Rooms, thus giving rise to the hospital's alternative and soon-to-be-adopted name&#151;The Rotunda. This, the first maternity hospital in Ireland and Great Britain, provided excellent facilities and developed a worldwide reputation for patient care, teaching, and clinical research. In May 1760 Ould was knighted by John Russell, the duke of Bedford and lord lieutenant of Ireland. A Dublin wit wrote the following epigram:<blockquote>
<div>Sir Fielding Ould is made a Knight,<br>
</div>
<div>He should have been a lord by right;<br>
</div>
<div>For then each lady's prayer would be,<br>
</div>
<div>O Lord, Good Lord, deliver me!<br>
</div> (Brody, 234&#150;40)</blockquote>During his professional career, which extended from 1736 to 1788, Ould was obstetrician not only to the destitute but also to the nobility, and he attended the countess of Wellesley at the birth of Arthur, duke of Wellington. He enhanced the reputation of the Dublin School of Midwifery and became acknowledged as one of Ireland's foremost obstetricians. Ould died at his home, 21 Frederick Street South, Dublin, of apoplexy on 29 November 1789 and was buried in the nearby St Ann's churchyard, Dawson Street.<br>
