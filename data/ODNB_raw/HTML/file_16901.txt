<span class="headword">Lockhart, Sir  George, of Carnwath</span>, Lord Carnwath  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1689), <span class="occ">advocate and judge</span>, seems to have been the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16903/', "Sir James Lockhart (1588/1599&#150;1674)")</script> of Lee in Lanarkshire, judge, and his second wife, Martha, daughter of Sir George Douglas of Mordington. His early years are obscure. He may have been the George Lockhart who assented for Lanarkshire to the tender for union in February 1652, and who signed the commission for the negotiation of union six months later, but he has frequently been confused with his brother-in-law, George Lockhart of Tarbrax, also in Lanarkshire. His first definite appearance in the record is at his admission to the bar on 8 January 1656. Perhaps at the instigation of his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16907/', "William Lockhart (1621?&#150;1675)")</script>, who had married Oliver Cromwell's niece and was ambassador to France, he was appointed advocate-general to the Commonwealth in June 1658. He was also appointed sheriff of Lanark, and in 1659 he represented Lanarkshire in Richard Cromwell's parliament. After the collapse of the Cromwellian government in Scotland he spent some time in composing a compendium of the law reports of Sir Alexander Gibson of Durie, which came to be widely used by other advocates after the Restoration.<br>
<br>Whether Lockhart shared his brother's enthusiasm for the Commonwealth is unclear, but it was thanks to his royalist father that Charles II accepted his formal apology for serving the usurper before he was readmitted to the bar on 16 July 1661. He rapidly secured a reputation as the finest pleader of his generation. Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh believed that he could be regarded as &#145;another Cicero&#146;, explaining that his technique was to arrange his arguments in such a way that they supported each other like the stones of an arch  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1716, 1.7). Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall maintained that when he spoke before his colleagues in court:<blockquote>he did so chain us, and with his tongue draw us all after him by the ears, in a pleasant gaping amazement and constraint, that the wonderfull effects of Orpheus' harp in moving the stones, seemes not impossible to ane orator on the stupidest spirit. (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, 1.80)</blockquote>Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, thought Lockhart &#145;the most learned lawyer, and the best pleader I have ever yet known in any nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.246). More formal and material recognition of his talents followed. He was knighted in 1663 and was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates in 1672. Involved in most of the major cases of his time, he had made enough money by 1681 to buy the estates of Braidwood, Dryden, and Carnwath, all in Lanarkshire. It was from the third estate that he took his title as a lord of session when he received the ultimate accolade of his profession on 21 December 1685, being appointed president of the college of justice in succession to Sir David Falconer of Newton.<br>
<br>It seems clear that Lockhart rose to the top of his profession more by virtue of his abilities than by any political manoeuvring. He had frequently appeared at the bar to defend religious dissidents, like those who had rebelled at Rullion Green in 1666 or had tried to assassinate the archbishop of St Andrews in 1668, and his performance on their behalf had always been as much fearless as eloquent and ingenious. In 1674 he had advised a client to appeal against a decision of the session to parliament. With the king's support, the affronted judges had disbarred Lockhart and his allies only to find that most of the other advocates were ready to withdraw from practice in sympathy. It had taken over a year for the deadlock to be broken and the administration of justice resumed, after which Lockhart had been admitted to the bar for the third time in his career on 28 January 1676. Three years later he had accepted a commission to appear in opposition to the government of the duke of Lauderdale before the king, and he had continued his forthright criticism of the regime as a member of parliament for Lanarkshire in 1681&#150;2. Yet if James VII had thus been given cause to favour his promotion, he had been given less cause by Lockhart's determined defence of the earl of Argyll in 1682 and by his opposition to the toleration of Catholicism in the parliament of 1685&#150;6. He evidently shared the commitment to the reformed faith that typified his home region, and was equally committed (though less typically among the advocates of his time) to doing his best for his clients.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Lockhart married Barbara Gilmour, possibly the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10756/', "Sir John Gilmour of Craigmillar (d. 1671)")</script>, president of the session. Following her death he married, on 2 September 1679, Philadelphia (<i>b</i>. 1655), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29170/', "Philip Wharton, fourth Baron Wharton (1613&#150;1696)")</script>. They had three children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16902/', "George Lockhart (1681?&#150;1731)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16906/', "Philip Lockhart (1689?&#150;1715)")</script>, and a daughter. On 31 March 1689 Lockhart was emerging from an Easter day service in the church of St Giles, Edinburgh, adjacent to the parliament house in which he had spent much of his professional career, when he was approached by John Chiesly of Dalry, a disgruntled litigant. Lockhart nodded and moved on, but Chiesly produced a pistol and shot him in the back. He died within minutes. His widow subsequently married Captain John Ramsey, and died in or after 1717.<br>
