<span class="headword">Read,  Samuel</span>  (1815&#150;1883), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born at Needham Market, Suffolk, where he was baptized at the Congregational church on 20 December 1815, the eldest of ten children of Thomas Read (1787/8&#150;1878), bootmaker, and his wife, Mary (1789/90&#150;1885). Educated at Theobald's Grammar School in Needham Market, he was articled late in 1830 to John Eddowes Sparrowe, attorney of the Ancient House, Ipswich, and town clerk. Sparrowe was ousted from his borough office for his involvement in bribery during the 1835 parliamentary election, but Read remained in his office until early in 1839, when he moved to that of William Mason, borough surveyor. Between May 1837 and December 1838 Read made eighty pencil portraits of the principal men of Ipswich, mostly drawn during court sessions or at meetings at which he accompanied Sparrowe. It was for Sparrowe, the leading Blue of the town, that he designed several effective anti-Yellow caricatures for publication in 1835&#150;6.<br>
<br>In 1841 Read went to London to learn wood-engraving with Josiah W. Whymper; he also studied with W. C. Smith, the watercolour painter. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1843, showing a drawing, <span class="italic">The Vestibule of the Painted Hall, Greenwich</span>, and he continued to exhibit there annually until 1857. By 1872 he had exhibited eighteen architectural drawings there, mainly interiors of English and Belgian churches, including several in Antwerp. He was the illustrator of several books, the first of which seems to have been <span class="italic">Zoological Studies</span>, published by the SPCK in 1844. In the same year he also began to do sketches for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>: his contributions to this paper included illustrations for stories and a series of large views of English cathedrals. In 1853 he was sent to Constantinople and the Black Sea, just before the outbreak of the Crimean War, as the first special artist for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. In the 1860s architectural sketches from his travels in Europe appeared in the paper; some were republished as <span class="italic">Leaves from a Sketchbook</span> (1875).<br>
<br>Read was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours (the Old Watercolour Society) in 1857, and a member in 1880. He contributed to every exhibition from 1857 onward, showing 210 paintings in all. In the 1870s he painted some landscapes, especially Scottish and Irish coastal views, but these were less successful than his European church interiors. On his way back from a sketching trip on the continent, he narrowly escaped death in the Staplehurst railway disaster of 9 June 1865: part of the train from Folkestone to London rolled off the embankment into a river, and the artist was trapped underwater. Charles Dickens was also a passenger on this train.<br>
<br>Read married, in Inverness on 26 June 1860, Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1831), a daughter of Robert Carruthers, the proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>; the couple had one son and one daughter. During the later years of his life he lived at Parkside, in Bromley, Kent; he was unofficially retained in old age as art editor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. He died on 6 May 1883 at Fort Cottage, Sidmouth, Devon, following a stroke. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, has seven of his watercolours, including <span class="italic">The Corridor, the Brewer's Hall, Antwerp</span> (1860), and the British Museum has several engraved proofs by the Dalziel brothers of his drawings. A characteristic drawing of Read's shows a cathedral, church, or castle, possibly ruined and covered in thick undergrowth, and &#145;delightfully dank and gloomy&#146;  (Houfe, 273).<br>
