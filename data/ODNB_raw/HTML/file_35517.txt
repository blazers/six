<span class="headword">Phillips,  William</span>  (1822&#150;1905), <span class="occ">botanist and antiquary</span>, was born on 4 May 1822 at Presteigne, the ninth of the ten children of Thomas and Elizabeth Phillips. After an elementary education in Presteigne, Phillips moved to Shrewsbury about 1836 to work with his older brothers in their tailor's shop in High Street. On 3 September 1846 he married Sarah Ann Hitchins (1824&#150;1895). The couple later had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After studying photography and astronomy Phillips was encouraged to take up botany by William Allport Leighton (1805&#150;1889) and William Houghton (1828&#150;1895) about 1861, and became interested in fungi about 1869. He achieved a European reputation as an authority on cryptogamic botany and his <span class="italic">Manual of the British Discomycetes</span> (1887) was immediately recognized as the definitive work on the subject. In 1875 he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. A genus of fungi was named <i>Phillipsia</i> in recognition of his work.<br>
<br>Phillips's records of Shropshire fungi, published by the Caradoc and Severn Valley Field Club, constitute the county's most important early mycological work. In 1897 he was elected chairman of a club committee set up to devise a flora of the county, and he was primarily responsible for mapping the county into districts for this project. In 1885 he supervised the transfer of the Shropshire Archaeological Society's collections to the new Shrewsbury Free Public Library and Museum and accepted the honorary duty of curator of botany.<br>
<br>Phillips's interest in local history arose when failing eyesight meant he was no longer able to pursue his microscopic investigations and botanical draughtsmanship. The establishment of the Shropshire Archaeological Society in 1877 provided a focus for much of his research. Between 1877 and 1905 its transactions contained forty-seven articles or notes by Phillips, most notably his edition of the <span class="italic">Ottley Papers</span> (1894&#150;6) which remains a major contribution to Shropshire's civil war history. He also published numerous articles in the antiquarian columns in the Shrewsbury and Oswestry newspapers. He edited and largely wrote the Shropshire notes and queries column in the <span class="italic">Shrewsbury Chronicle</span> and transcribed the registers of four parishes for publication by the Shropshire Parish Register Society.<br>
<br>Phillips was an active magistrate from 1886 and a trustee of local charities which he judiciously administered to the benefit of the town's poor. He played an important role in the establishment of the Shropshire Horticultural Society. In 1903 he was granted the honorary freedom of Shrewsbury for his many services to the town. He was methodical, industrious, generous, and unassuming. He disliked political and theological controversy. Politically he was a Liberal. In religion he was &#145;an old fashioned Methodist&#146;, sometime acting as a local preacher. However, he was well known among the local Anglican clergy and was married and buried according to the rites of the Church of England. Phillips died from heart disease at his home, Aucuba House, Canonbury, Shrewsbury, on 23 October 1905 and was buried in the town's general cemetery three days later. His herbarium was purchased by the Shrewsbury Free Public Library and Museum, as were his local history manuscripts.<br>
