<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Matthews,  Victor Collin</span>, Baron Matthews  (1919&#150;1995), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 5 December 1919 at 14 Cloudesley Square, Islington, London, the son of Abraham Cohen Matthews, a master tailor, and his wife, Jenny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards. His father disappeared soon after his birth, and he was brought up by his mother. Educated at Highbury School, he never lost his cockney accent, or his love of Arsenal football team. He left school at fourteen, and his first job was as an office boy for a tobacco company. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and took part in the evacuation from Dunkirk and in the Dieppe raid; he ended the war with the rank of able seaman. On 7 March 1942 he married Joyce Geraldine (1922/3&#150;1995), a typist, daughter of Alfred Ernest Pilbeam, a builder's foreman; they had one son, Ian.<br>
<br>After demobilization Matthews joined the building firm of Trollope and Colls as a trainee surveyor; he rose to be contracts manager before moving to a small building products firm, Clark and Fenn, as a director. In 1960 he struck out on his own, acquiring the Brixton-based building firm Bridge Walker; within four years he had increased its turnover eightfold, to about &pound;2 million. Among his major clients was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72953/', "Nigel Broackes")</script>. When a take-over bid was launched for Bridge Walker in 1964, Broackes, who was keen to diversify, agreed to take a 49 per cent stake in the company, with an option on the remainder. The partnership worked well, and in 1967 Matthews merged the rest of his company with Trafalgar House and joined the board. In 1968 he became group managing director, and in 1973 deputy chairman.<br>
<br>Under the leadership of Broackes and Matthews, Trafalgar House expanded rapidly into a conglomerate covering construction, leisure, and shipping, with a value at one point estimated to be in excess of &pound;2 billion. Among its major acquisitions were Trollope and Colls in 1966, the Cunard shipping line in 1971, and the Ritz Hotel in 1976. Broackes, shrewd and audacious, provided the brains, while Matthews combined managerial skills with on-site experience. As group managing director (1968&#150;77), deputy chairman (1973&#150;85), and group chief executive (1977&#150;83), Matthews was Broackes's right-hand man, though they were never close socially: in all their years together neither visited the other's home. Matthews, short, dark, and decisive, was a blunt cockney of humble origin. By contrast, the patrician Broackes, educated at Stowe School before national service in the 3rd hussars, was a smooth entrepreneur with a touch of arrogance.<br>
<br>Matthews became a press lord almost by accident when he and Broackes acquired Beaverbrook Newspapers in 1977, at the knock-down price of &pound;15 million. The controlling family interests sold out to forestall the marauding Rupert Murdoch. The group was heavily in debt after years of decline following the death in 1964 of its founder, Lord Beaverbrook, though the fixed assets were worth over &pound;50 million and the three main titles&#151;the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, and the London <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>&#151;still managed to sell 20 million copies a week. Broackes made no secret of the fact that his main consideration in acquiring Beaverbrook Newspapers was to give Matthews a new role away from Trafalgar House. The two were still partners, but there was mounting tension between them. By 1977 the builder was becoming disenchanted with the demands of big business. At one time he was managing nearly 200 companies. Now he was talking of retiring to pursue his hobby, training racehorses with his son Ian. In his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Growing Concern</span> (1979), Broackes described Matthews at this point as &#145;morbid and morose&#146;  (Broackes, 245). Matthews replied with a stinging rebuttal in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>.<br>
<br>In fact, taking on Beaverbrook's mantle perfectly suited Matthews, who felt he still had much to offer at fifty-eight. He was fiercely patriotic and greatly admired the Canadian tycoon's empire crusades. As a young boy delivering newspapers, he had dreamed of becoming a <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> reporter. Shy and quiet, with piercing brown eyes, he swept into Fleet Street in his Rolls-Royce determined to succeed in his new role as chairman and chief executive. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> had been transformed from broadsheet to tabloid&#151;he pronounced it &#145;tab-o-loid&#146;&#151;shortly before his arrival without any discernible improvement in its fortunes. He immediately poached as editor of the <span class="italic">Express</span> the managing editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, Derek Jameson, another fatherless cockney from north London. The satirical magazine <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> immediately dubbed the pair Lord Whelks and Sid Yobbo.<br>
<br>Matthews renamed the group Express Newspapers and got down to tackling the excessive demands of the notoriously difficult print unions. The engineers were first to knock at his door, demanding a 75 per cent pay increase. For once management stood firm and the confrontation turned nasty. There was a publishing room fire and editorial cars were vandalized. The police were called in and barbed wire was erected around the <span class="italic">Express</span>'s black glass headquarters, known as the Black Lubyanka. Faced with Matthews's refusal to yield&#151;he had been outraged by the engineers' demanding twice as much money for half the work they did in the building trade&#151;the union backed off. Matthews subsequently won court injunctions to prevent the unions usurping what he called the right of management to manage. It was the beginning of a new era in Fleet Street. Ultimately Matthews won the reluctant support of the unions, telling the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>: &#145;Fleet Street is not overmanned but under-employed.&#146; In 1978 he decided to use some of the group's excess printing capacity, and in the process secured hundreds of jobs, with the launch of the <span class="italic">Daily Star</span>, Britain's first new national newspaper for 75 years. In 1980 he negotiated a merger between the two loss-making London evening papers, the Express group's <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> and Associated Newspapers' <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, to form a single, profitable <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>; Associated Newspapers subsequently bought full control of the paper.<br>
<br>A natural Thatcherite and reputedly the biggest individual donor to the Conservative Party, Matthews was rewarded with a life peerage, as Baron Matthews, in 1980. (Broackes was knighted in 1984.) Apart from taming the print unions, his other great achievement as chairman of Express Newspapers was to unfreeze the treasure trove locked into Reuters, then a co-operative jointly owned by newspapers. Ironically the revenue raised by the news agency's flotation made Trafalgar's publishing interests, from 1982 demerged into Fleet Holdings, with Matthews as chairman, ripe for take-over. In 1985 the group succumbed to a hostile bid by the rival United Newspapers, headed by David Stevens. Under Matthews's skilful management, the group's value had multiplied more than twentyfold, to &pound;317 million. Matthews's personal stake was worth around &pound;8 million. He severed his remaining links with Trafalgar and retired to Jersey. Lonely and all but forgotten in his last decade, he died at his home, Waverley Farm, Mont Arthur, St Brelades, Jersey, on his seventy-sixth birthday, 5 December 1995, two months after Joyce, his wife of fifty-three years. He was survived by his son Ian.<br>
