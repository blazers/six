<span class="headword">Vaux,  Anne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1562, <em>d.</em> in or after 1637), <span class="occ">recusant</span>, was the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28165/', "William Vaux, third Baron Vaux of Harrowden (1535&#150;1595)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1873/', "John Beaumont")</script>, master of the rolls from 1550 to 1552. Anne was baptized at Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, on 9 July 1562; her mother was buried in the same parish on 12 August that year.<br>
<br>The family was strongly attached to Catholicism. For several years Anne Vaux worked hard and took considerable risks on behalf of the Jesuit provincial, Father Henry Garnett, to whom she was clearly devoted. Anne and her widowed sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69032/', "Eleanor Brooksby")</script>, used their wealth to rent houses where missionary priests might meet in safety. One such property was White Webbs in Enfield Chase. In 1604 Anne Vaux, under the assumed name Mrs Perkins, and Garnett were dwelling in a house at Wandsworth, and both there and at White Webbs they were visited by, among others, her &#145;cousin german removed&#146; Francis Tresham, the final man to be admitted to the Gunpowder Plot in 1605  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/212). Tresham's aunt, Mary, was Anne's stepmother. During the summer of 1605 Anne accompanied Garnett and other prominent English recusants on the much publicized &#145;pilgrimage&#146; to St Winifred's Well (Holywell), Flintshire. Although kept in ignorance of the conspirators' plans Anne certainly had her suspicions: White Webbs was visited by several Gunpowder Plot conspirators that summer and autumn, and on the way to Holywell she had noted the &#145;fine horses&#146; in the stables of Catholic houses, later recalling how she had &#145;feared these wild heads had something in hand, and prayed him [Garnett] for God's sake to talke with Mr Catesbye and to hinder any thinge that possibly he might&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/200).<br>
<br>A theory that Anne Vaux wrote the warning letter to Lord Monteagle which ultimately frustrated the Gunpowder Plot rests solely on perceived similarities between her handwriting and the &#145;disguised hand&#146; used by the author; it lacks credibility  (Nicholls, 214). She was at Coughton Court in late October and early November. When the plot was discovered she was arrested, but swiftly discharged on Lewis Pickering's bond. She concealed the fugitive Garnett in his vain efforts to avoid capture at Hindlip, Worcester, the home of Thomas Abington (or Habington). Garnett was arrested there on 25 January and conveyed to the Tower of London.<br>
<br>The ever-loyal Anne Vaux followed Garnett to the capital and managed to establish a channel of communications through his gaoler, writing to Garnett in an invisible ink at the foot of innocuous messages about spectacles and unpaid bills. Unfortunately, the gaoler passed every letter to the authorities. Anne was arrested in March and joined Garnett in the Tower. Records survive for her examinations on 11 and 24 March, in which she insisted on her innocence from any complicity in treason while admitting to the by now well-documented visits of conspirators to her various residences. She was released in August 1606, and was in part responsible for publicizing &#145;Garnett's straw&#146;, an ear of corn, allegedly from the straw spread around the scaffold at Garnett's execution, which upon magnification appeared to carry a likeness of the dead man.<br>
<br>For many years the two Vaux sisters lived quietly at Shoby on the Brooksbys' Leicestershire estates, harbouring the Jesuit Father William Wright. In 1625 they were convicted of recusancy at Leicester Castle, but neither paid the fine demanded. After Eleanor Brooksby's death that same year, Anne, still with Father Wright in tow, moved to Stanley Grange in Derbyshire. There she kept what amounted to a school for the sons of Catholic gentlefolk: an attempt was made by the ecclesiastical authorities to suppress the establishment in 1635, but this may not have been entirely successful. The last extant reference to Anne Vaux comes in a parish register entry for the death of one of her servants in February 1637. Stanley Grange, however, long remained a centre for Jesuit activities in England.<br>
