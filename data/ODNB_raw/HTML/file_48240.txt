<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas Edward</span>, Baron Williams  (1892&#150;1966), <span class="occ">Co-operative Society administrator and politician</span>, was born on 26 July 1892 at 62 Ynys-hir Road, Ynys-hir, in the Rhondda valley, Glamorgan, the son of William Williams, a colliery timberman at Wattstown collieries, and his wife, Mary Davies. Educated at Ynys-hir Boys' School and Porth county school, Williams began what was to prove a long and illustrious career with the Co-operative Wholesale Society by gaining a post, at the age of fourteen, as a junior clerk in its Ynys-hir branch. The co-operative movement then occupied an important place in working-class community life and, alongside the Labour Party and the trade unions, formed the third pillar of the labour movement. Co-operative retail societies offered low prices and profit-sharing dividends to customers and also played a social and educational role, through the Co-operative Union, within the community. The Co-operative Wholesale Society, to whom the retail societies were federated, was formed in 1863 to offer banking and trading facilities. Although a Co-operative Party was established in 1917, many societies became directly affiliated to Labour at an early date.<br>
<br>After attending evening classes for several years at nearby Tonypandy Williams secured a two-year scholarship to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he obtained diplomas in economics and industrial history. This was a familiar route for many young men from south Wales, some of whom returned home afterwards to take up political office or trade union posts, while others moved on to fresh fields. Williams was one of the latter for, on leaving Ruskin, he entered the Woolwich Arsenal Co-operative Society. However, with the onset of the First World War, he joined the Middlesex regiment pioneer corps where he attained the rank of quartermaster sergeant. While serving in Salonika he contracted malaria and dysentery and spent eighteen months in military hospitals abroad and in Dublin before recovery. On 14 May 1921 he married Lavinia Mary Northam of Plumstead; they had one daughter, Gweneth Mary, in 1927.<br>
<br>Williams resumed his career with the Co-operative Wholesale Society and eventually worked his way up through the ranks to become its national president in 1951. In addition, he became chairman or director of various bodies such as the English and Scottish Joint Co-operative Wholesale Society and the New Zealand Produce Association Limited. His work in this field also brought him international as well as national recognition, not least in the shape of his appointment as a commander of the order of Dannebrog by the government of Denmark.<br>
<br>Williams was prominent in both local and national politics. A member of Woolwich borough council from 1919 to 1922, Williams was also a member of the London county council between 1932 and 1935, becoming chairman of its parliamentary committee and vice-chairman of the public assistance committee. He was also a justice of the peace. On a national level, Williams was a member of the national executive of the Labour Party between 1931 and 1935. He contested the constituency of Finsbury Park for Labour at the general election of 1931 but was defeated by over 7000 votes by the National Labour candidate.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Williams's particular expertise saw him appointed to serve on the Ministry of Food's tea distribution committee. In recognition of his lifelong commitment to the co-operative movement he was awarded a barony in the king's birthday honours list of 1948. He took as his title Baron Williams of Ynyshir to the delight of that village's inhabitants who presented him with an illuminated scroll to mark the event at a ceremony held in Moriah Chapel, Ynys-hir, where he had worshipped as a boy.<br>
<br>Williams's post-war offices included serving as a part-time member of the London Transport executive, as president of the Co-operative Congress in 1953, and as a commissioner for the crown estates from 1956 to 1966. He died at his home, 35 Foxes Dale, Blackheath, London, on 18 February 1966. He was survived by his wife.<br>
