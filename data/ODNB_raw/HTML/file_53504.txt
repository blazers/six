<span class="headword">Lawson,  Thomas George</span>  (1814&#150;1891), <span class="occ">colonial official and Baptist leader</span>, was born in October 1814 in the town of New London, Anecho, in west Africa, the second son of George Acquatay Lawson (<i>c</i>.1778&#150;1856), political leader and merchant, and his wife, Ad&oacute;l&egrave;vi Ap&eacute;, a sister of the king of Anloga (Awuna in British documents). George A. Lawson, born Aku&eacute;t&eacute; Zankli, was the son of Lat&eacute; Awoku (<i>c</i>.1739&#150;1795) and the grandson of Lat&eacute; Bewu, who came from Accra to the kingdom of Glidji about 1730. A few years after his arrival Lat&eacute; Bewu married Adaku, a daughter of Assiongbon Dandj&eacute;, king of Glidji.<br>
<br>The coastal region near Glidji was one centre of European trade with which local African rulers were closely involved. In the 1750s, as a means of becoming better informed, Lat&eacute; Bewu entrusted Lat&eacute; Awoku to the British captain of a merchant ship for education in commerce and the English language. In family documents the captain's name is given as Law or Lawson, and a Captain William Lawson was active along the coast during this period. Lat&eacute; Awoku returned well versed in commerce and was granted land by the ruler of Anecho about 1767. In turn Lat&eacute; Awoku sent Aku&eacute;t&eacute; Zankli &#145;to Britain&#146; to study, but it is likely that he settled for a time in the Sierra Leone colony and may have had a son there who remained in Freetown when Aku&eacute;t&eacute; Zankli returned to Anecho in 1812 or before. There he succeeded his father as an adviser to the king and built a town called Badji, later renamed New London. It was he, or possibly his father, who assumed the family name Lawson.<br>
<br>By 1825 New London was closely allied with the United Kingdom, and following family tradition Thomas George Lawson was entrusted to Captain Isaac Spence from London for further education. Whether or not he was meant to study in London, Lawson disembarked at Freetown and was taken in by John McCormack, a wealthy timber merchant and a chief adviser to the colonial government. He lived in McCormack's large house on Rawdon Street and was educated in colonial schools. He often travelled with McCormack on business and fact-finding tours into the interior north and east of the colony. For several years he was employed by McCormack's timber company as a trading agent in the interior and as an interpreter. Through his extensive contacts he learned several African languages and gained substantial knowledge of Arabic. By about 1840 he was married to a woman from one of the royal houses of Koya kingdom, located about 30 miles east of Freetown. It appears that at least three children came from this liaison: William Thomas George Lawson, who was born about 1840; Thomas George Lawson, who died in 1897; and a daughter, who died in 1878.<br>
<br>McCormack was so favourably impressed by Lawson's knowledge of African cultures and languages and by his skill as an intermediary that he recommended him for the position of the governor's personal messenger to African rulers in the interior. Between 1846 and 1851 Lawson ably fulfilled his mission, and Governor Norman William Macdonald recommended to the Colonial Office that he be appointed as the first official colony messenger and interpreter with an annual salary of &pound;100. He became the principal colonial official responsible for representing British interests in the interior and for receiving African notables who travelled to Freetown.<br>
<br>From Lawson's official appointment on 1 May 1852 until January 1889 he was the director of &#145;native affairs&#146; for the British administration, and was deeply involved in the expansion of the coastal settlement into the colony and protectorate of Sierra Leone which occurred in 1896. Under government auspices he went on dozens of missions to various African kingdoms and towns, he arranged the housing and interpreted for African rulers or their representatives when they came to Freetown, and he presented thousands of pages of reports and memoranda to senior colonial officers. His writings and personal advice to several governors and administrators-in-chief provided the data and analytical basis for colonial policy.<br>
<br>Lawson was a devoted Christian and an outspoken supporter of Queen Victoria and British administration in Africa. His religious proclivities are attested to by his active role in the West African Methodist church between 1840 and 1850. In 1850 he became a Baptist, and in 1853 he assisted John McCormack in founding the Church of God Chapel, an independent Baptist church for which he acted as manager. He married his second wife, Sarian (Sarah Anne in its Anglicized form), in St George's Cathedral in January 1863. They had at least two children. Moses Thomas George and Catherine Sarah Anne, like their older siblings, were educated in colonial schools and married into prominent Sierra Leone families. All Lawson's children and at least one grandson, James Glynn Lawson, became important members of Sierra Leone society.<br>
<br>As a devout Christian and firm exponent of British colonial expansion Lawson took every opportunity to pursue his mission and to exhort African rulers to accept British values and administration. From his experiences with African notables he had developed a strong respect for Islam which he considered to be a &#145;civilizing&#146; influence, and he had good relations with many important Muslim leaders whom he successfully brought into the British colonial administration.<br>
<br>The Colonial Office in London recognized Lawson's essential role in representing British interests and in providing information and analysis that led to a network of treaties with African rulers by granting him British citizenship in 1860, by rewarding him with regular increases in his salary, and by authorizing a grand retirement ceremony for him in 1886. Governor Rowe wrote to the secretary of state in the Colonial Office on 18 May 1886: &#145;I do hope that Your Lordship may be pleased to show some special mark of appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Lawson. They stand, I believe, alone and without equal in the history of Her Majesty's Settlements on this Coast&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 267/363, Dispatch 160). Hundreds of colonial officials and African notables from Freetown and the interior attended the ceremony in September 1886. He did not officially retire until January 1889, as his services were so essential for the smooth running of the administration.<br>
<br>Lawson's salary at retirement was &pound;350, with substantial additional income as a landlord in Freetown and owner of valuable farm lands in the interior. He continued to reside in his large house on Charlotte Street until his death, in Freetown, in June 1891. His funeral was held on 14 June 1891 in Freetown, and services were conducted by the Revd C. Marke at the Church of God Chapel on Regent Street. More than four thousand persons attended the funeral. Among them were all the chief colonial officials, political and professional leaders, merchants, and Muslim and Christian clerics. Lawson was the most significant African officer in the British colonial service during the nineteenth century.<br>
