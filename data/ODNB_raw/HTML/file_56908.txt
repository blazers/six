<span class="headword">Leslie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Oppenheim]</span>,  Doris</span> <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Doris  Fergusson Hannay, Lady Fergusson Hannay]</span>  (1891&#150;1982), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at 66 Westbourne Grove, London, on 9 March 1891 of Jewish descent. Her parents were Samuel Oppenheim, a tobacconist, and his wife, Sarah Elkan. Doris was evasive about her early life. She said she was educated privately in London and Brussels, and then after she showed a gift for drawing her father sent her to a school of art in London. It is certain that at fifteen she decided to become an actress against her father's wishes, and won a scholarship to the drama section of the Guildhall School of Music. Her stage d&eacute;but was as Viola in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> at the Old Vic. She also appeared with the Birmingham repertory theatre. While still in her teens she married John Leslie, another actor. He died shortly after the marriage; she kept his name for the rest of her life. Her second marriage was to R. Vincent Cookes, but she did not publicly acknowledge this marriage for &#145;religious reasons&#146;  (Ashley).<br>
<br>After her first husband's death Doris Leslie lost interest in acting and resumed her art studies, this time in Florence. She kept regular diaries while in Italy and realized that writing was her vocation. On her return to England she wrote her first novel, <span class="italic">The Starling</span> (1927), set in Florence. Its success committed her to writing, although she later dismissed her four subsequent novels, <span class="italic">Fools in Mortar</span> (1928), <span class="italic">The Echoing Green</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Terminus</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Puppets' Parade</span> (1931), as trivial. But <span class="italic">Full Flavour</span> (1934), a fictional account of the long life of a woman who makes a success of her father's business, in the then popular dynasty chronicle genre, established her reputation. It was quickly translated into five languages and adapted for the stage. It was dedicated to her mother, who did not live to see it published. In 1936 Doris Leslie published <span class="italic">Fair Company</span>, another &#145;leisurely&#146; tale, this time spanning four generations of an English family from the Regency up to the 1930s.<br>
<br>Some of the many characters in <span class="italic">Full Flavour</span> and <span class="italic">Fair Company</span> reappear in the crowded pages of the Victorian-to-First World War chronicle of <span class="italic">Concord in Jeopardy</span> (1938), but Leslie's loose style and uninspired plotting were beginning to make readers unhappy with just well crafted historical backgrounds. Moreover she unsuccessfully attempted to psychologize Concord and make him a symbol. <span class="italic">Another Cynthia: the adventures of Cynthia Lady Ffulkes (1780&#150;1850) reconstructed from her hitherto unpublished memoirs</span> (1939), a tale of a Moll Flanders figure who snares titled lovers, was more &#145;lively&#146;. This was a word often used by critics to describe Leslie's work, although the diary format she used in fact renders action as more reported than experienced. On 21 November 1936 she married Walter Fergusson Leisrinck Hannay (1904&#150;1961), a London physician who was knighted in 1951. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Leslie was slightly wounded while serving in civil defence as an air raid warden. The battle of Britain featured in <span class="italic">House in the Dust</span> (1942), in which a bombed house triggers the memories of her central character, Jennifer. However, the twentieth-century anachronisms, in what was largely a tale of Victorian childhood, irritated the critics. Also in the 1940s came a series of &#145;fictional biographies&#146;, first of Chopin in <span class="italic">Polonaise</span> (1943), and then of Lady Arabella Stuart in <span class="italic">A Wreath for Arabella</span> (1948). These were not scholarly works of biography but vivid and colourful portraits designed to entertain. She also produced novels such as <span class="italic">Folly's End</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">The Peverills</span> (1946). In the 1950s Leslie published <span class="italic">The Great Corinthian</span> (1952), an entertaining biography of the prince regent, and novels which included <span class="italic">Peridot flight: a novel reconstructed from the memoirs of Peridot, Lady Mulvarnie, 1872&#150;1955</span> (1956). Hutchinson reprinted <span class="italic">Another Cynthia</span>, <span class="italic">Folly's End</span>, and <span class="italic">The Peverills</span> in 1956 as <span class="italic">Tales of Grace and Favour</span>.<br>
<br>After Sir Walter's death in 1961 Doris Leslie converted to Roman Catholicism, moved to Devon, and began to breed and show English bulldogs. She became a real celebrity when BBC television broadcast her <span class="italic">Peridot</span> series. Over her lifetime she wrote more than sixteen popular novels and seventeen biographies, and while they were not critically esteemed, particularly as historical fiction came under fire in the 1960s, her books were widely enjoyed in Britain and America. Her biographies, which later included works on Fran&ccedil;ois Villon (1962), Elizabeth Chudleigh (1974), and Richard the Lionheart (1977), were often as finely wrought as her best historical novels.<br>
<br>Doris Leslie was a striking woman with very dark eyes and black bobbed hair. Unable to type, she wrote all her books in longhand and had her hand insured for a large amount of money. She had settled near East Grinstead, Sussex, when she died of renal failure on 31 May 1982 at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton.<br>
