<span class="headword">Robertson,  (Charles) Martin</span>  (1911&#150;2004), <span class="occ">archaeologist and poet</span>, was born on 11 September 1911 at Jesmond Hill, Pangbourne, Berkshire, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35777/', "Donald Struan Robertson (1885&#150;1961)")</script>, later regius professor of Greek at Cambridge University, and his wife, Petica Coursolles, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1883&#150;1941), who hosted a literary salon. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 2 Huntingdon Road, Cambridge. His younger brother Giles (1913&#150;1987) became a distinguished historian of Renaissance art at Edinburgh University. Martin (as he was always known) attended the Leys School, Cambridge, and Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he graduated with a first-class degree in classics in 1934. Before and after Cambridge he visited the British School at Athens, to which he was always devoted; he was later a long-serving member of its governing council and its chairman from 1959 to 1968.<br>
<br>In Athens from 1934 to 1936 Robertson studied under Humfry Payne, joined excavations, travelled, and developed his lasting interest in Greek pottery in the company of several other scholars who had been led by Payne in the same direction (including Robert and John Cook, Tom Dunbabin, and Arthur Lane). In 1936 he joined the staff of the department of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum. During the Second World War he served in British intelligence in Egypt and Italy; after the war he returned to the British Museum to help replace the collections which had been in store for the duration of the war. In 1948 he succeeded Bernard Ashmole, his mentor in the museum, as Yates professor of classical art and archaeology at University College, London, a post he held until 1961, when he again succeeded Ashmole, as Lincoln professor of classical archaeology and art at Oxford. He held this post until his retirement in 1978.<br>
<br>Robertson's major contribution to scholarship was in the field of Greek vase painting, especially Athenian, and the processes of attribution to painters' hands pioneered by Sir John Beazley at Oxford. He published on non-Athenian pottery from excavations (Ithaca, al-Mina) but without the devotion he accorded to Athenian pottery of the sixth to fourth centuries <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. This culminated much later in <span class="italic">The Art of Vase Painting in Classical Athens</span> (1992), backed by numerous articles. His connoisseurship extended into all other aspects of the study, iconographic and aesthetic, and he integrated the subject into the general study of Greek art. A related interest was in the evidence for painting in antiquity in any medium, which resulted in a volume for the publishers Skira, <span class="italic">Greek Painting</span> (1959), while his overall interest and experience in Greek art led to his two-volume <span class="italic">A History of Greek Art</span> (1975; abridged edition, 1981). This was in many ways a very personal work, but comprehensive enough to serve as a handbook for many years, and it was notable for Robertson's ability to give proper place to the less well-known or well-preserved arts, such as painting on material other than vases and mosaic. His sense of responsibility to see to publication the works of former friends and colleagues led to considerable editorial labour over the publication of the second volume of the Athens School excavations at Perachora (1962) and John Beazley's <span class="italic">Paralipomena</span> (1971). There was also a duty to collection publication: he collaborated with John Boardman over the Castle Ashby vases for a <span class="italic">Corpus vasorum</span> volume (1978), and published a catalogue of the Greek, Etruscan, and Roman vases in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight (1987). He was presented with a Festschrift, <span class="italic">The Eye of Greece: Studies in the Art of Athens</span> (1982), where there is a list of writings, supplemented in his British Academy memoir.<br>
<br>Robertson was a careful, not enthusiastic lecturer, with a minor voice impediment, but well able to engage the attention of those devoted to his subject. He was attentive to the needs of his graduate students, failing, if at all, only in not being too critical of their work. A generation of classical art historians owed much to him for the inspiration of their studies, either through personal contact or from his writing, and from his sturdy and reasoned championing of traditional scholarly method. His interest in and understanding of Greek literature stood him in good stead with his literary colleagues and in dealing with mythology in art, on which he wrote several articles. His scholarship and authority were widely acknowledged. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1967 and received its Kenyon medal in 1985. Among other honours he was elected an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, Lincoln College, Oxford, and University College, London, and received an honorary doctorate from Queen's University, Belfast. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton, in 1968&#150;9 and at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu, in 1980.<br>
<br>Robertson was a dedicated cyclist perforce, since he never learned to drive a car, but no athlete, although lithe in physique, and he generally had no time for anything mechanical. He was happy to leave administrative matters to others but never shirked his duty as chairman of committees, in the university and for the British School at Athens. In many respects he maintained some of the manners of the aesthete scholar, but he was always approachable and never less than kindly with the faults of others. He had written poetry throughout adulthood, personal, often witty and sensitive, much admired by many, and several volumes were published, notably <span class="italic">A Hot Bath at Bedtime</span> (1977), <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty's Prince</span> (1977), and some translations from Greek.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1942 Robertson married (Theodosia) Cecil, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spring Rice the 21-year-old daughter of Edward Dominick Spring Rice, financier. Cecil lived near Aldeburgh during the war, a town to which they were always drawn, with its festival, and friendship with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears. They had four sons and two daughters. When they moved to Oxford they lived at Sheepstead House, Marcham, from which Robertson cycled daily the ten miles to the university. Upon his retirement from the Oxford chair they moved to Cambridge, near the town centre, in Parker Street. There he continued research and writing. In 1984 Cecil died suddenly. On 19 May 1988 Robertson married Louise Berge, a 50-year-old museum curator who had been one of his graduate students. She was American, the daughter of Chester Holstein, a petty officer in the United States Navy. She was able to help his continuing work and publication, and nursed him, lightening several painful last years (when he suffered from Guillian-Barr&eacute; syndrome, then myasthenia gravis), until his death in their Cambridge home on 26 December 2004, of heart disease and bronchopneumonia. He was buried in Cambridge cemetery on 5 January 2005. He was survived by his second wife, Louise, and the six children of his first marriage, one of whom was the rock musician Thomas Robertson, known as Thomas Dolby.<br>
