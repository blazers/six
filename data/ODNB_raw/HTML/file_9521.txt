<span class="headword">Fitton, Sir  Edward</span>  (1527&#150;1579), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born on 31 March 1527, the eldest son of Sir Edward Fitton (<i>d</i>. 1548) of Gawsworth, Cheshire, and Mary, daughter and coheir of Guicciard Harbottle of Northumberland. He was brother to Thomas, Francis (<i>d</i>. 1608), Anthony, George, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1591), who married Sir Richard Leveson, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1567), who married John Englefield. His formal education is not documented, but he had scholarly interests and translated a text by Martin Luther into English. Fitton married Anne (1527&#150;1574), second daughter of Peter Warburton of Areley, Chester, on 19 January 1540. They were then &#145;in the 12 yere of their age and lyved together in true and lawfull matrymonie just 34 yeres&#146;  (monument, St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin). They had nine sons and six daughters: the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9522/', "Edward Fitton")</script>, was born in 1548 or 1549.<br>
<br>Fitton served as a JP in Cheshire, was a member of parliament for Cheshire in 1553, and was knighted on 19 October 1553. He entered on his Gawsworth lands in May 1557, his mother having died on 2 December 1556. He disposed of his interest in the manor of Moreley in Sussex, and with Robert Tatton paid &pound;2600 for the reversion of the manors of Aldford, Echeles, and Alderley in Cheshire. By August 1568 he was being proposed by Sir William Cecil for the newly created office of president of Connacht and Thomond, and was appointed by patent on 1 June 1569, at an annual fee of &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. sterling.<br>
<br>Fitton arrived in Ireland on 19 May and Sir Henry Sidney accompanied him to Connacht in mid-June. Though appointed as a civil administrator, with the support of just thirty horsemen, twenty footmen, and one lieutenant, he soon fashioned the presidency into a primarily military post. He had completed a circuit of counties Roscommon and Galway by early January 1570, enforcing the common law. At first he had the co-operation of the earl of Clanricarde, already dependent on English support. However, he encountered resistance from the O'Briens in Thomond. Conor O'Brien, third earl of Thomond, went into rebellion in February 1570, and by April Fitton was requesting increased military support. His assistant Ralph Rokeby agreed that &#145;it is not gentleness that will win them nor clemency nor mercy, nor the name of a lord president and council &hellip; it must be fire and sword&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/30, no. 44). Fitton had some success in the summer of 1570, capturing the strategically important castle of Shrule, though being injured himself. Soon afterwards he and his provincial council were virtually besieged by Thomond at Galway. Reporting in March 1571 on an expedition to north Connacht during which he had indicted the Burkes of Mayo, O'Connor Don, and McDermot, he made the wildly optimistic claim that by Easter term the queen might be entitled to half Connacht.<br>
<br>The departure of Sir Henry Sidney as lord deputy in March 1571 left Fitton without influential backing in the Dublin administration. The new deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam, disapproved of provincial presidencies but was impressed by Fitton when they met in Dublin in May 1571 to deal with the earl of Clanricarde. Fitzwilliam reported to Cecil that Fitton &#145;doth bear a good upright and Godly conscience. A wise and sober man he is, and such a one as doth not shew to be moved with passions&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/32, no. 44). From May 1571, however, Fitton repeatedly requested to be recalled from Connacht. He had a clear understanding of the difficulties he faced. He realized that billeting soldiers on the province caused more problems than it solved, yet was unable to envisage how to avoid using force. His soldiers had not been paid since September 1569, and when the earl of Clanricarde's sons went into rebellion in April 1572, Fitton initially did not have the military capacity to deal with them. Fitzwilliam challenged Fitton's handling of the revolt and insisted on releasing Clanricarde from Dublin Castle, thereby forcing the president to concede the superior authority of the earl within the Clanricarde lordship. Discouraged by failure, Fitton departed for England in December 1572, and Sidney's plans for a provincial presidency were temporarily shelved.<br>
<br>The office of president of Connacht was suspended, though Fitton was allowed to retain his lease on Athlone. He was appointed vice-treasurer and treasurer-at-wars, in place of Sir William Fitzwilliam, from January 1573. Returning to Ireland, he was given responsibility for escorting home the earl of Desmond and his brother John, eventually reaching Dublin on 25 March. He had also been entrusted with transporting &pound;4000. Fitton eventually took up office as vice-treasurer in early May 1573. A fresh controversy arose in June when one of his servants was murdered in retaliation for an earlier assault. Fitton disputed Fitzwilliam's handling of the incident. Tension between the lord deputy and the vice-treasurer was such by mid-June that Fitton refused to co-sign any papers bearing Fitzwilliam's signature. Fitton found himself imprisoned in Dublin Castle, charged with contempt. He instructed his son Edward to obtain a copy of any letter the lord deputy wrote concerning him. It soon emerged that the queen favoured Fitton rather than the lord deputy in this dispute, but Fitzwilliam retaliated by requesting that Fitton be removed from the office of treasurer or that a deputy be appointed.<br>
<br>Fitton retained the office of vice-treasurer until his death, and was normally based at Whitefriars, Dublin. One of his five brothers, Anthony, was based in Galway, where he was collector of the customs. He employed another brother, Francis, and his own sons Edward and Alexander in official duties, to the extent that on his death his eldest son regarded it as essential that he take charge of the office of receiver-general. From 1573 Fitton had combined some responsibility for Connacht with his duties as vice-treasurer. He accompanied Fitzwilliam to Kilkenny to deal with Sir Edward Butler, but refused to proceed into Munster to deal with disturbances likely to arise following the escape of the earl of Desmond. He was discharged from his authority for Connacht soon after the return of Sir Henry Sidney as lord deputy in 1575. He accompanied Sidney on his expedition to Carrickfergus in autumn 1575. His journey to Connacht in June 1576 was probably his last, and he had relinquished his interest in Athlone Castle to Sir Nicholas Malby by July 1576.<br>
<br>The years 1573 to 1575 were years of tension between Fitton and the lord deputy, Fitzwilliam, exacerbated by shortage of money to meet the government's debts. The lavish funeral held for his wife on 17 January 1574 depleted Fitton's personal resources as well as prompting a dispute between the Ulster king at arms and the vicars-choral at St Patrick's Cathedral. Nevertheless, Fitton enjoyed the support of William Cecil, whose favours extended to Fitton's family, and he was able to have personal meetings with Queen Elizabeth. William Drury reported Fitton's death on 3 July 1579 &#145;from the disease of the country&#146;, caught during an expedition to Longford. Drury recorded that he was:<blockquote>in many men's opinions over careful of his posterity, and was not without enemies that sought to interpret that to his discredit; but I wish in his successor that temperance, judgment, and ability to speak in her Majesty's causes that was found in him. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/67, no. 25)</blockquote>A summary of his personal accounts signed on 1 July 1579, just two days before his death, indicates that his resources had been reduced by half by his ten years service in Ireland. He had, however, purchased land called Hazelwood to the value of &pound;888 for his eldest son, Edward. His will, made in 1574 and proved on 2 December 1579, left his lands and goods to his son Edward. Under the terms of the will Edward junior was required to pay his father's outstanding debts, provide &pound;400 for each of his unmarried sisters, and provide for the education of his brothers William and Francis.<br>
<br>Fitton was buried on 21 September 1579 in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, beside his wife, Anne. A brass monument in the south choir aisle of the cathedral depicts the couple with their fifteen children all in attitudes of prayer, and contains a brief summary of his career.<br>
