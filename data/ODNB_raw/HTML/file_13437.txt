<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hodgson,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1678?, <em>d.</em> 1755), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, is probably identifiable with the son of James Hodgson (or Hodson) and his wife, Elizabeth, who was baptized at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 25 February 1678. From 1 April 1695 he was assistant to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9669/', "John Flamsteed")</script>, the first astronomer royal, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich; he later claimed that this was the main source of his education. Flamsteed states that he arrived because &#145;Sir Christopher Wren would needs put a relation of his, an ingenious youth, &hellip; into my service&#146;  (Baily, 64); the relationship is confirmed by letters in which Wren's son addressed Hodgson as cousin.<br>
<br>Hodgson was evidently employed by Flamsteed under a seven-year indenture, as on 6 February 1702 he was &#145;nearly out of his time&#146;  (RS, MS 798.1). His handwriting appears frequently among Flamsteed's surviving papers from the intervening period, in observation notes, calculations, tables, copies of letters, and other documents. In 1701 Flamsteed evaluated him in the following words:<blockquote>a Sober Young man about 22 Years of Age. A very good Geometrician and Algebraist [who] Understands the Series and fluxions tho I have not Suffered him to Spend much time in them because I could not Spare him from the calculation work he understands the Latin Tongue indifferently, haveing got [it] since he became my Servant he knows my method and is acquainted with all my Labors and will easily finish and print them If God should call me hence before I shall have perfected them my Self. (Royal Greenwich Observatory papers, RGO 1/33, fol. 173)</blockquote>On 31 October 1702 Hodgson married Ann Heming, Flamsteed's niece (in effect adopted daughter), without first seeking Flamsteed's approval; she continued to live at the observatory (after her husband had left Flamsteed's employment) until October 1706, then moved to London to join her husband. Among their children were Katharine (<i>b</i>. 1706), John (<i>b</i>. 1708), and James (<i>b</i>. 1710), who were baptized at St Peter-le-Poer, St Botolph (Aldersgate) and Christ Church Greyfriars respectively, all in the City of London. On 20 February 1703 Flamsteed wrote of Hodgson &#145;my Elder servant has left me about 4 moneths agone to teach Mathematicks in London&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 36452, fol. 134<i>r</i>); the following August Hodgson could be contacted at Jones's Coffee House in Finch Lane, Cornhill. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1703 and admitted on 15 December following, leading Flamsteed to comment: &#145;they have a limbe of me &hellip; but he is honest and discreet and &hellip; will not serve some mens small designs as they expect he should&#146;  (RS, MS 798.14).<br>
<br>Hodgson not only taught privately but also participated in the growing fashion for coffee-house lecturing. In October 1704 he launched a course &#145;For the Advancement of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy&#146;, held at the Hand and Pen, formerly Ayers' Writing School, in St Paul's Churchyard. A printed advertisement at the end of the first edition of Halley's <span class="italic">Miscellanea curiosa</span> (1705) gives details and states that much of the necessary apparatus was supplied by the elder Francis Hauksbee. The venture seems to have been a success: by December 1705 Flamsteed said Hodgson was &#145;full of business with a book of Navigation in the press. Pretty store of pupills and some business in my Concernes&#146;  (RS, MS 798.40). The book was <span class="italic">The Theory of Navigation Demonstrated</span> (1706), dedicated to Prince George of Denmark. In the following year Hodgson succeeded John Harris as lecturer on mechanics at the Marine Coffee House, near the Royal Exchange.<br>
<br>On 12 January 1709 Hodgson was appointed to run the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, at an annual salary of &pound;100. As one of the most competent of the school's early masters, he had no difficulty retaining the post until his death, and from 1748 he was permitted to employ a deputy on the grounds of old age. He published material designed for his pupils' use as <span class="italic">A System of the Mathematics</span> (1723).<br>
<br>Hodgson's other mathematical publications include <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Fluxions</span> (1736) and several shorter treatises on practical subjects. He also produced <span class="italic">A Theory of Jupiter's Satellites</span> (1750) and papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on astronomical topics. He remained in close touch with Flamsteed, who relied on him as an intermediary in his dealings with the Royal Society and with the &#145;referees&#146; overseeing publication of the <span class="italic">Historia coelestis</span> (1712); he later acted jointly with Flamsteed's widow to ensure that the &#145;authorized&#146; version of this work (1725) and the <span class="italic">Atlas coelestis</span> (1729) were completed. After Mrs Flamsteed's death, Hodgson had custody of Flamsteed's papers and relics from the Royal Observatory; in 1736 and 1737 he gave the Royal Society a clock and object-glass from this source. He died on 25 June 1755, probably at Christ's Hospital, London. His place of burial is likely to have been Christ Church Greyfriars, London, but this has not been confirmed.<br>
