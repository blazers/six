<span class="headword">Balfour <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Arnot]</span>,  Robert</span>, second Lord Balfour of Burleigh  (<em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Sir Robert Arnot of Fernie (<i>d</i>. 1606), chamberlain of Fife, and his wife, Margaret Averie. In September 1606 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1639), daughter of Michael Balfour, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and Margaret, daughter of Lundie of Lundie. Apparently prior to the marriage he took his future father-in-law's surname and, in return for large sums paid over by the elder Robert Arnot, was made joint heir to Lord Balfour with Margaret. Balfour entered local affairs as a JP for Fife and Kinross in 1610 and on 8 July 1613 assumed his father's former position as chamberlain of Fife. He and his wife succeeded her father on 15 March 1619 and by a letter from James VI and I he became second Lord Balfour of Burleigh and as such sat in the parliaments of 1621, 1633, and 1639, and in the 1625 convention of estates. In 1627 he was appointed to the commission for surrenders and teinds, set up to implement Charles I's revocation scheme. He was also named to local government positions, to oversee the highways from Dunfermline to Falkland, and as a Fife member of commissions for warning beacons (1627) and to implement legislation against Jesuits and seminary priests (1629).<br>
<br>Although Burleigh lacked the obvious presbyterian&#150;constitutionalist background of some Fife nobles, his allegiance to those causes quickly became apparent. At the Scottish parliament on 11 June 1640, in the absence of a royal commissioner, the estates appointed the radical Burleigh their president. He sat on the committee for provisioning the army (4 June 1640) and on the committee of estates. In the autumn of 1640 he was fitting out a regiment in Fife for Alexander Leslie's army in Newcastle. He served as a commissioner in London for the treaty of peace with England (1640&#150;41) and in 1641 again held the office of president of parliament. The Scottish parliament appointed Burleigh <i>ad vitam aut culpam</i> to the privy council on 11 November 1641 and he was a constant member of the committee of estates from 1641 to 1647. He continued to support the covenanter military by serving on the committee for standing regiments (November 1641) and on the committees for levying and supplying the army raised for service in Ulster and for funding the army of the solemn league and covenant, raised for service in England (1643&#150;4). On 28 February 1643 he lent &pound;300 for provisioning the Ulster army. During the campaigns against Montrose he energetically supported the covenanter government. His military career, however, though enthusiastically embarked upon, met with signal failure. From April 1644 he was joint colonel of a regiment of Fife foot with his future son-in-law David Wemyss, Lord Elcho. The unit served in Argyll's spring campaign against the north-eastern royalists, and Burleigh took an active role in suppressing them. He served as president of the committee for the north from 16 April 1644. Following orders from the estates, he took command in Aberdeen after the covenanter defeat at Tippermuir. He addressed the inhabitants at Greyfriars Kirk on 26 August, appealing for men to defend the covenant, the Reformation, and their lives, women, children, and goods against the Irish and their highland allies. Montrose defeated him outside Aberdeen on 12 September 1644 when instead of using the burgh defences he marched his forces outside the burgh, then failed to exercise any control of his subordinates. After the battle he fled south. At Kilsyth, on 15 August 1645, he was one of the committee of estates who forced General William Baillie into a disastrous flank advance which resulted in Montrose's greatest victory. Burleigh's regiment ceased to exist some time after 30 January 1646.<br>
<br>As one of ten kirk party nobles, Burleigh unsuccessfully opposed the engagement to rescue the king from the English parliamentarians in 1648 and helped lead the Fife contingent in the whiggamore raid that overthrew the engager regime in late September. In September and October 1648 he was an unofficial member of the committee of estates. In January 1649 Burleigh was one of only sixteen nobles present at parliament. The estates named him a colonel of foot for Fife, though he failed to act on the commission, and in the same year he became one of the commissioners of the treasury and exchequer. In 1650 he served as vice-president of parliament. On 28 June parliament appointed him to the committee set up to purge the army of former royalists and engagers, and on 3 July he received a commission as colonel of foot for the shires of Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peebles. On 13 August he was one of the colonels who presented the anti-royalist West Kirk declaration to the committee of estates. Burleigh's radical sympathies led him to vote against condemning the western remonstrance (critical of Charles II and of alleged breaches of the covenants) in a meeting of the committee of estates in late November 1650. The only reference to activities of his last military command was an order of 24 December to garrison Lochleven Castle. On 31 March 1651 he began his final stint as president of parliament. He became protectorate JP for Fife in 1656. From August to December 1660 he was the only radical noble who regularly attended the committee of estates meetings, and he remained active in politics, attending the 1661&#150;3 parliaments despite the defeat of the covenanters at the Restoration.<br>
<br>Burleigh died at his home, Burleigh Castle, near Kinross, on 10 August 1663, and was buried at Orwell parish church on the 12th. His wife had died before him, at Edinburgh in June 1639, and was also buried at Orwell. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1191/', "John Balfour, third Lord Balfour of Burleigh")</script>, who married Isabel, daughter of Sir William Balfour of Pitcullo, lieutenant of the Tower, in 1649&#151;which marriage his father tried to annul&#151;and four daughters: Anna married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29034/', "David Wemyss, second earl of Wemyss")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29035/', "Wemyss, David, fourth earl of Wemyss")</script>]; Margaret was the wife of Sir James Crawford of Kilbirnie; Isabel married Thomas Ruthven, first Lord Ruthven of Freeland; and Jean seems to have married a cousin, Arnot of Fernie.<br>
