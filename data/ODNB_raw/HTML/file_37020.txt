<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woollard,  Frank George</span>  (1883&#150;1957), <span class="occ">developer of mass production</span>, was born on 22 September 1883 in London, the son of George Woollard, general steward to a firm of private bankers, and his wife, Emily Constance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Powell. He was educated at the City of London School and Goldsmiths and Birkbeck colleges. Between 1900 and 1905 he was apprenticed to Dugald Drummond with the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) at Eastleigh, Hampshire. There he was exposed to two factors that would shape his future career: he was involved in the design of an early motorized vehicle, the Clarkson Steam Omnibus, and he also witnessed the introduction of a crude assembly line in 1904 to manufacture all steel coaches. The cycle time on this line was seven and one-third hours, a factor which encouraged Woollard later in his career to consider flow production techniques in the British automobile industry despite relatively short production runs.<br>
<br>About 1905 Woollard left LSWR to begin a career in the car industry. He worked for a number of years in the design office of Weigel Motors Ltd, which was well known for its car racing successes. In 1911 he married Catherine Elizabeth Richards, daughter of Henry Richards, engraver. They had a son who died in infancy and a daughter, Joan Elizabeth, who became a sculptor and painter. After a brief time with Medhurst and Brewer, consulting engineers, he became chief draughtsman with E. G. Wrigley &amp; Co. in Birmingham, rising to director and chief engineer in 1917 and assistant managing engineer in 1918. During the First World War, he was responsible for the production of tank gearboxes, his first exposure to producing large numbers of standardized products. After the war, he supervised a contract to manufacture front and rear axles, and gearboxes for the Morris Cowley. Production was reorganized along flow lines to meet Morris's demands.<br>
<br>In 1923 Woollard left Wrigley to become director and general manager of the engine branch of Morris Motors Ltd. His first task was to reorganize the old Hotchkiss plant in Coventry. With the use of flow production assembly techniques, within a year output increased from 300 to 1200 engines per week. In early 1924 the machinery used to manufacture engine blocks, the heaviest and most complex component of an engine, was reorganized and placed in order according to the sequence of individual operations. Initially, the machines were linked with hand conveyors and workers manually pushed blocks between production stations. In late 1924 a bold step was taken towards automated production with the introduction of a hydraulic system which automatically moved blocks between stations, clamped them into fixtures, and sequenced the machines.<br>
<br>Woollard had appreciated that such a system offered advantages in the areas of planning and co-ordination, and in the control of labour, giving management more authority to set the pace of work. He believed that such control would be accepted by the workforce if it was accompanied by rising living standards. At the time, this was itself almost as radical a concept as the shift to automated production. Woollard's innovative use of automatic transfer machinery had to be abandoned because of failures in the electric, hydraulic, and pneumatic control mechanisms. However, he paved the way for Ford to implement a similar system in Detroit some twenty years later.<br>
<br>Woollard was a director of Morris Motors from 1926 to 1932, leaving the company in 1932 partly because of personal disagreements with Morris, who retained a firm control of company policy. He moved on to become managing director of Rudge-Whitworth Ltd (1932&#150;6), director of Birmingham Aluminium Casting Company Ltd, and director of the Midland Motor Cylinder Company Ltd (1936&#150;53), after which he retired. His inability to find employment with one of the major British vehicle companies may indicate how little his innovative methods were appreciated by the majority of entrepreneurs in control of the motor industry. He was active, and it would seem respected, within a number of professional associations. Having joined the Institution of Automobile Engineers (IAE) in 1915, he went on to become its president from 1945 to 1947. He arranged the IAE's merger with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) in 1947, becoming the first chairman of the automobile division of the IME. He was also a member of the Institution of Production Engineers, chairman of the executive committee of the Aluminium Development Association (1949&#150;52), and chairman of the Zinc Alloy Die Casting Association (1952&#150;6). He was a founding member of the British Institute of Management and a member of the American Society of Automotive Engineers.<br>
<br>In later life, Woollard became active in educating industrial administrators at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham College of Technology, where he was chairman of the industrial administration group (1951&#150;7). He also returned to writing. His <span class="italic">Principles of Mass and Flow Production</span> (1954) extended the ideas originally presented in a series of papers in 1925. Based on his experiences at Morris Motors, it provides a rare insight into the question of mass production in the pre-1939 British context.<br>
<br>Woollard was known as kind, gifted, and philosophical, someone with a sense of humour, a twinkle in his eyes, and a sincere interest in the welfare of his colleagues and his students. He died of heart failure on 22 December 1957, in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham.<br>
