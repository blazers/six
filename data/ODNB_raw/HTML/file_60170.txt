<span class="headword">Tovey,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Coventry and baptized there on 23 October 1597 in Holy Trinity Church, son of John Tovey (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1614), schoolmaster of the free school in Coventry, who, according to William Dugdale, &#145;had for his habitation the mansion house&#146;. In 1602 John Tovey resigned his post and the following year moved 2 miles to Combe Abbey, Warwickshire, in order to assume the post of tutor to John Harington, the son of Baron Harington of Exton. Nathaniel Tovey lived in the Harington household until 1612, when he matriculated as a sizar at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. The following year John Tovey and the younger Harington travelled to Italy; both died shortly after their return to England. The responsibility for Nathaniel Tovey's education was then assumed by Lucy, countess of Bedford (Harington's sister).<br>
<br>Tovey graduated BA in 1616 and proceeded MA in 1619. In 1621 he was incorporated MA at Oxford and he was ordained, in London, as a deacon and elected to a fellowship and a lectureship in logic at Christ's College, Cambridge. He was dean of the college from 1621 to 1623, and in 1624 served as praelector, so the entries in the admissions book for that year are in his hand. The triers' admission book for 1654 credits Tovey with a BD, but there is no record in the university lists for the relevant period of his receiving this degree.<br>
<br>Probably in Michaelmas term 1627, Tovey became tutor to John Milton on his readmission to college after quarrelling with his original tutor, William Chappell. There may well have been an existing link between them, since the younger Harington's funeral sermon had been preached by Richard Stock, rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, London, where the Miltons worshipped. When Milton's brother Christopher came up to Christ's College in 1631, he too was assigned to Tovey. The Milton brothers left Cambridge in July 1632.<br>
<br>In 1630 Tovey was appointed rector of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and in 1634 he left Cambridge to take up the appointment. In the autumn of 1634 he travelled to London to appear with five other fellows of Christ's before the court of high commission. The nature of the accusations is nowhere specified, though it may have been related to the conduct of services in the Christ's College chapel, but in any case the six fellows were discharged on 19 November, and Tovey returned to Lutterworth.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1636 Tovey married Elizabeth Warner (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Silvester Warner of Wolston Manor and niece of the mathematician Walter Warner. As Wolston Manor was about a mile from Combe Abbey it seems likely that Nathaniel and Elizabeth had known each other for many years. A cache of letters from Tovey to his brother-in-law George Warner in London constitutes a fascinating window into the life of a seventeenth-century Leicestershire rector. Tovey lived quietly in Lutterworth until 1646, when his glebe land was sequestered and a series of charges was laid by the county committee: he was accused of assisting the king's forces in the garrisons at Worcester, Lichfield, and elsewhere, refusing to use the <span class="italic">Directory for the Publique Worship of God</span> instead of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, railing in the altar, and raising the steps in the chancel. Tovey was ejected, and in 1647 an intruder was installed in Lutterworth. Tovey's whereabouts during his ecclesiastical exile are not known, but in 1654 he secured the patronage of John Manners, earl of Rutland, a prominent supporter of the parliamentary cause, and was appointed rector of Aylestone, Leicestershire, where he recorded in the register that the amendment of the <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> in June 1657 restored the right of ministers to conduct weddings.<br>
<br>In 1658 Tovey and his wife both succumbed to a visitation of plague, and were buried in Aylestone on 9 September 1658. Their son, John, had predeceased them, but they were survived by their daughter, Elizabeth Vincent.<br>
