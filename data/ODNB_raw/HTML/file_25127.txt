<span class="headword">Seton, Sir  William, of Pitmedden</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1673, <em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was baptized on 6 March 1673, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25115/', "Alexander Seton of Pitmedden (1639?&#150;1719)")</script>, first baronet and lord of the court of session as Lord Pitmedden, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1723), daughter of William Lauder, one of the clerks of session. Throughout the troubles of the seventeenth century the Setons had proved loyal to the Stuarts, though Lord Pitmedden had found himself unable to accept either James VII's policy of toleration or his subsequent deposition. Unlike his father, William embraced both toleration and the principles of the revolution of 1688, though without breaking definitively from his cavalier heritage. Exposure to his father's magnificent library (though this was sold on Lord Pitmedden's death) and to the precepts of an excellent tutor, William Smith, who in 1693 went on to become a regent at Marischal College, Aberdeen, may account for the erudition and political sophistication of Seton's later pamphleteering.<br>
<br>In the early part of his political career Seton adopted a &#145;country&#146; oppositionist stance, and won immediate notoriety as a reformist pamphleteer of dubious loyalty. His anonymous <span class="italic">Memorial to the Members of Parliament of the Court Party</span> (1700) earned him imprisonment in the toll-booth of Edinburgh, and was burnt by the public hangman on 16 November 1700 for its &#145;high reflections&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 10.210&#150;11) on the king's majesty, the proceedings of parliament, and the government of the church. Apologizing to the parliamentary committee which had authorized his detention, Seton denied any &#145;sinistruous or bad designe&#146;  (ibid., 10.214) and won a prompt release. The <span class="italic">Memorial</span>, written in the traumatic aftermath of the Darien fiasco, advocated various plans for the regeneration of Scotland, criticized the union of the crowns for failing Scotland's interests, and, imprudently, urged suspension of judgement on King William's Scottish church policy &#145;till we have the Honour of seeing him here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorial</span>, 4).<br>
<br>Of more substance was <span class="italic">The Interest of Scotland in Three Essays</span> (1700, with a second edition in 1702), in which Seton set out a political programme whose central planks were to survive his later switch from oppositionist to placeman. Seton had already identified an incorporating union as the best solution to Scotland's ills, though his proposals for full integration of churches and laws as well as parliaments in <span class="italic">The Interest of Scotland</span> went much further than the treaty of union which Seton would help negotiate in 1706. Seton also displayed a commitment to mixed government and to the values of civil liberty and the protection of property rights, which played central roles in his unionist vision of a Scotland liberated within a united Britain from its turbulent magnates. These &#145;whiggish&#146; positions sat awkwardly with his cavalier connections. Yet Seton was a sceptical whig: his Commonwealth-style constitutionalism stood at some remove from uncritical Williamite cheerleading, and his advocacy of presbyterian church government was far from unequivocal.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Interest of Scotland</span> Seton continued the distinctive eirenic ecclesiology associated in the north-east with the Aberdeen doctors. Unconvinced by claims made for the divine right status of any particular form of ecclesiastical polity, Seton wondered which would best conform to the post-revolution constitution. Identifying episcopal hierarchy as a pillar of absolute monarchy, Seton concluded that, were England and Scotland to unite, as he believed they should, their liberties would be best protected by an Erastian union of their churches under either superintendency or presbytery.<br>
<br>The amphibious latitude which Seton displayed in both his politics and churchmanship bewildered his contemporaries as well as historians. In 1706 a Jacobite agent included Seton, elected to the Scottish parliament in 1702, in a list of the &#145;loyal and honest men&#146; returned for Aberdeenshire  (Macpherson, 2.17). On the other hand, Daniel Defoe pigeon-holed him as &#145;an honest whig&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 179). Despite his whiggish political philosophy, Seton's parliamentary career, which included a spell as a commissioner for public accounts in 1703&#150;4, suggests a continuing adherence to the Episcopalian&#150;Jacobite values of his family and region.<br>
<br>Seton endorsed the cavalier campaign for the toleration of Episcopalians in <span class="italic">A continuation of a few brief and modest reflexions persuading a just indulgence to be granted to the episcopal clergy and people in Scotland</span> (1703). In July 1704 he moved a patriot overture in parliament that there be no nomination of a successor to the crown in that session; consideration should be given instead to rectification of Scotland's government. The suspicion of Jacobitism is reinforced by Seton's support at this stage for the programme of the duke of Hamilton. Nevertheless, Seton's position bears some affinity with the scheme of limitations espoused by Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, a salutary reminder of the shared inspiration of Commonwealth politics which explains the surprisingly narrow gap between Seton's commitment to incorporating union and Fletcher's celebrated anti-unionist patriotism. After all, in 1700 Seton had perceived &#145;a necessity for Scotland, either to unite with England, or separate from it&#146;  (W. Seton, <span class="italic">The Interest of Scotland</span>, 1700, 110). But patriotic trouble-making in pre-union Scottish politics was also often the first step to being bought off with office, and Seton's own brand was not without its price. In November 1704 the earl of Seafield, a leading courtier, received this message:<blockquote>Pittmeden younger pretends a great keyndnes to your Lo., and sayes most serieouslie to me that if your Lo. will obtain him a pension of one houndreth pound per annum, he will be your servant and give you a sutable returne. He would have the first termes payment at Candlemas nixt. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 382)</blockquote>Nationalist historians have used this evidence of opportunism to discount the principled conviction behind Seton's subsequent activities to promote the union. Although his partisanship was weak and he enjoyed the rewards of office as a courtier, having become a collector of bishops' rents in 1705 (until 1714) and a commissioner for union in 1706, Seton was a long-standing supporter of incorporating union. He was described as a zealous supporter of union in Sir John Clerk of Penicuik's Latin history of the Union of 1707. Clerk also remarked that Seton was not renowned for eloquence, though he made a number of important parliamentary interventions in the Union debates. His speech of 2 November 1706 on the first article of union was published as a pamphlet, and his speech of 18 November on the third article is given at length in Defoe's <span class="italic">History of the Union</span>. Seton also published <span class="italic">Scotland's Great Advantages by an Union with England</span> (1706). Here Seton set out the easy choice facing Scotland between &#145;Union with Peace and Plenty, or Dis-Union with Slavery and Poverty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Advantages</span>, 8), warned Jacobites not to aim at advancing &#145;the Interest of any Prince, to the disadvantage of their Country&#146;  (ibid., 9), and chided patriots for spouting empty rhetoric about the loss of Scottish nationhood: Scotland's &#145;Sovereignty and Independency&#146; would be asserted to greater effect within the Union than for &#145;a long time&#146;  (ibid., 11).<br>
<br>Seton sat in the British parliament in 1707&#150;8, and sat on the equivalent commission between 1707 and 1717. However, his active political and literary career culminated in the Union. He was described by his friend William Nicolson, bishop of Carlisle, as &#145;an ingenious Gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries</span>, 451). He married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, and they had four sons and five daughters. Seton died in 1744.<br>
