<span class="headword">Lombe <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Beevor]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1798/9&#150;1852), <span class="occ">landowner and philanthropist</span>, was the son of Edward Beevor, a barrister. He succeeded his father in 1847 as tenant for life to the Lombe estate of Melton Hall, Wymondham, Norfolk, both having taken, by act of parliament, the name of Lombe to comply with the conditions of the will of Sir John Lombe (<i>d</i>. 27 May 1817).<br>
<br>Lombe's father, on inheriting the life interest in the Lombe estate, proved to be a resolute, if contrary, individual. Sir John Lombe left a large sum held in trust specifically for the building of &#145;a mansion house&#146; at Bylaugh in Norfolk as the seat of the Lombe estate; Edward Lombe senior resisted the trustees for thirty years. The building fund accumulated inexorably: by 1839 it stood at over &pound;63,000. It was not until Edward Lombe the younger succeeded to the estate that the trustees were able to build Bylaugh Hall. It is ironic that the younger Lombe never saw the long-awaited mansion, for he lived abroad from the late 1820s until his death at Florence in 1852, and after 1830 never returned to England.<br>
<br>In 1826 Lombe was returned as MP for Arundel, a constituency in the gift of the duke of Norfolk. He received the duke's patronage on the understanding that he would vote for Catholic emancipation. Never in robust health, Lombe retired from politics in 1830. In the 1820s, when he had a leg amputated, he was nursed by a Mrs Lydia Emily Howis to whom he subsequently paid an allowance of &pound;200 a year for over twenty years. She claimed that he had promised to provide for her after his death, and in support produced to Lombe's executors an 1828 will of Lombe's. She alleged also that he had driven one of her daughters to the grave through &#145;inconsistent waverings&#146; and broken promises. To her anguish and grief, Lydia Howis was left nothing in Lombe's final will, executed in Florence in October 1851.<br>
<br>It was from Florence that Lombe ran his Norfolk estate on enlightened principles and also contributed to liberal causes in the United Kingdom. He described himself as &#145;ultra-liberal&#146; in all matters of politics, philosophy, and religion. He gave financial support to W. E. Hickson, editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, by paying handsomely for articles commissioned on topics he himself suggested. Lombe's continuing support for the <span class="italic">Review</span> was a crucial factor in John Chapman's acquiring it from Hickson in 1851. George Eliot was Chapman's assistant editor and she attempted to incorporate Lombe's somewhat opaque notion of &#145;organic growth&#146; into the prospectus for the <span class="italic">Review</span>. Lombe was a generous, but sometimes exacting, patron: it was Robert Browning, whom he knew in Florence, who identified the symptoms of &#145;Lombago&#146;. But there were also unconditional offers of help, such as to Thomas Carlyle (via Browning) of &pound;200 a year &#145;without strings&#146;. On hearing that Harriet Martineau hoped to translate Auguste Comte's <span class="italic">Cours de philosophie positive</span>, he immediately arranged for &pound;500 to be forwarded to her.<br>
<br>Lombe financed certain educational projects aimed at improving the economic prospects of the working classes. A firm believer in secular education, he gave financial support to George Combe (1788&#150;1858) and others who were particularly active in promoting this cause. Lombe founded a college in Sheffield, and expended &pound;1000 on the People's College in Norwich.<br>
<br>Lombe married a Frenchwoman, Maria Royer de St Julien. They had no children. He died unexpectedly in Florence on 1 March 1852, aged 53, and was buried in the English cemetery at Florence. His personal property was left to University College Hospital, London, with a life interest to his wife. It is poignant that he may never have met any of the individual beneficiaries of his gifts, nor witnessed the operation of the good causes he supported.<br>
