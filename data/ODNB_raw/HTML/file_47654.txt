<span class="headword">Stock,  Eugene</span>  (1836&#150;1928), <span class="occ">missionary society administrator and journal editor</span>, was born on 26 February 1836 in Duke Street, Westminster, London, the first of three children of &#145;a gentleman of position and wealth&#146;  (Stock, 43&#150;4) named on Stock's second marriage certificate as Edward Bell. Little is known of his father and mother, but he had two sisters, Sarah Geraldina and Caroline. Family circumstances were strained by loss of the family fortune to speculation, so that his mother had to support the family alone from 1846: Stock attended day schools in London and Brighton and Arnold House, Lowestoft (1851&#150;3), but was forced largely to educate himself and was soon employed as a clerk in a London mercantile office. In 1862 he married Eliza Mann (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter of Commander Adrian Mann RN. Stock's evangelical Anglicanism led to Sunday school work in Islington and service from 1867 to 1875 as editor to the Church of England Sunday School Institute. In 1871 he became editor of the penny-weekly newspaper <span class="italic">Church Bells</span>; when his employer went bankrupt in 1873, he was invited to work as an editor (assisted by his sister Sarah) at the Church Missionary Society (CMS), the largest of the British foreign missionary societies. He was successful in popularizing the publications of the society: by the 1890s the <span class="italic">Church Missionary Gleaner</span> had attained a monthly circulation of 80,000 and the annual total production of books, magazines, and pamphlets approached 7 million.<br>
<br>Stock quickly rose in influence at the CMS owing to his diligence, wide knowledge, and clarity of thought. His sympathy to evangelical revivalism drew him successively into the confidence of two CMS chief secretaries, Henry Wright (1872&#150;81) and Frederick Wigram (1881&#150;95), which gave him influence in the evangelical subculture at Cambridge University, and also provided him with the inspiration to create popular lay organizations in Britain such as the CMS Gleaners' Union, which achieved a membership of 80,000 by 1895. Between 1881 and 1906 Stock helped to engineer an unprecedented increase in missionaries at the CMS from 260 to 1000, due largely to strong home organization and the work of single women. Stock and Wigram also emphasized the use of English university graduates to lead overseas missions, sometimes at the expense of removing indigenous church leaders; this new practice at the CMS increased metropolitan authority, although the ultimate goal of independent &#145;native&#146; churches was not abandoned.<br>
<br>Despite his strong evangelical principles, Stock remained a loyal churchman who helped to lead the CMS away from radical forms of protestantism. He was a member of many church organizations, including the London diocesan conference, the house of laymen, and the national church assembly but championed missionary ecumenism with the high-church party and nonconformists. He was also an important supporter of the efforts of university students to increase missionary co-operation that led to the Pan-Anglican Conference of 1908 and the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference of 1910. His most visible achievement was the production of a history of the CMS (4 vols., 1899&#150;1916), which is unique among Victorian missionary histories in its attention to politics, religious parties, and ecclesiastical developments. This work sealed his reputation as &#145;a sort of lay incarnation of the CMS&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Sept 1928).<br>
<br>A breakdown in health led to Stock's resignation as editorial secretary in 1902. He remained a CMS secretary without portfolio until his retirement in 1906, whereupon he was appointed a vice-president to the society, regularly attending the general committee for twelve more years. In his retirement he remained one of the most influential and visible advocates of foreign missions. On 20 August 1902, aged sixty-six, at St Saviour's Church, South Hampstead, London, Stock married the Hon. Isabella Emily Fiennes, the daughter of Charles Francis Gregg, herself fifty-six and a widow. In 1908 he was awarded an honorary degree of DCL by the University of Durham. Following an accident in which he was knocked down by a motor car he died at his home, Melita, 21 Poole Road, Bournemouth, on 7 September 1928 and was buried in Bournemouth cemetery.<br>
<br>In addition to numerous articles appearing in CMS publications and the religious press, Stock published many tracts, pamphlets, and books, including (besides the <span class="italic">History of the Church Missionary Society</span>) <span class="italic">My Recollections</span> (1909); a widely used Sunday school guide, <span class="italic">Lessons on the Life of Our Lord</span> (1871); several works on missions; and a number of commentaries on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
