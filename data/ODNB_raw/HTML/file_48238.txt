<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Steadman,  William Charles</span>  (1851&#150;1911), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 12 July 1851 at 24 Pennyfields in the Poplar district of London, the eldest of the three children of William Daniel Steadman and his wife, Jane Ruth Steadman, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anson. While his father, a shipwright, served in the Royal Navy, he spent part of his boyhood with relatives amid the almost endemic poverty of the East End. Educated at a nearby national school, at the age of eight he began to make a contribution to the family income: he ran errands, sold newspapers, and worked as a pot-boy in a public house. Just before his fifteenth birthday he was apprenticed to the barge-building trade; he improved his education at evening classes. In 1875 he married Jessie Wall; they had four daughters.<br>
<br>On completing his apprenticeship in 1873, Steadman joined the barge builders' trade union, a small craft society formed in the previous year, and was soon an active member; in 1879 he became the union's general secretary, a post he held until 1908. Steadman's leading part in an eighteen-week strike of barge builders in 1890 enhanced his standing in London working-class politics. In March 1892 he successfully contested Hackney as a Progressive for a seat on the London county council (LCC). A few months later he stood with Liberal support as a candidate for Mid Kent in the general election, but was defeated, as he was in 1895 when he contested Hammersmith. By this time he had become a full-time activist, maintained in part by modest payments from his union and a committee of supporters. This gave him the freedom to work with the small Labour group on the LCC which included Ben Tillett, Will Crooks, and John Burns, and to become a poor-law guardian in Mile End. During his membership of the LCC, on which he sat until 1907, he specialized in housing and public health. The Fabian Society was another organization of which he was an active member, and his study entitled <span class="italic">Overcrowding in London and its Remedy</span> was published as Fabian tract 103 in 1900. He was involved with Toynbee Hall and various campaigns on such issues as old-age pensions, unemployment, and the eight-hour day, some of which were organized by the London Trades Council on which he was also prominent. In 1899 he was elected to the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress; he presided over the congress of 1902, which met in London.<br>
<br>Steadman became MP for the Stepney division of Tower Hamlets at a by-election in March 1898. The Liberal Party financed his campaign, a consideration which helped to make him cautious towards independent labour representation. In parliament he asked numerous questions about working conditions, especially those of Post Office employees in whom he took a special interest, and compulsory vaccination which he opposed, but he lost the seat in the general election of 1900. At the inaugural conference of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95367', "Labour Representation Committee (LRC)")</script> in February 1900 he was elected to the chair; whether &#145;they formed a Labour Party or allied themselves to other political parties in the House of Commons&#146;, he told the delegates, &#145;let them be represented by men of character, men who had borne the heat and burden of the day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of the Conference on Labour Representation</span>, 10). He became an approved candidate of the LRC, for the Central Finsbury constituency, only to break away when required not to identify with any other party. He was then president of the Stepney Liberal, Radical, and Progressive Association and financially dependent on the Liberal Party at Central Finsbury, which he won in the general election of 1906. In the House of Commons he often co-operated with the Labour Party, many of whose members had similar origins and attitudes to his. His secretaryship of the parliamentary committee of the TUC&#151;he succeeded Sam Woods in 1904&#151;led to pressure for him to switch to the Labour Party, but he resisted it. The post was a salaried one (&pound;250 a year, &pound;300 from 1907) and so reduced his financial worries, though he was not comfortable with the administrative demands of the office (a factor which influenced the appointment of his successor, C. W. Bowerman, who had a reputation for efficiency).<br>
<br>Steadman went to the poll at Central Finsbury as a Liberal in the general election of January 1910, but was defeated. Not long after intimating his intention to resign as secretary of the parliamentary committee, he died at 29 Wilmington Gardens, Barking, on 20 July 1911. He was buried on 26 July in the East London cemetery. He was survived by his wife. Stockily built and with a ready wit, Steadman was a cockney of cockneys and a London character after the heart of Dickens, according to Ben Tillett. His personal popularity overcame much of the criticism directed at his continued &#145;Lib&#150;Labism&#146;. Frederick Rogers recalled him as a &#145;man distinguished for the simple honesty of his character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Labour, Life and Literature</span>, 219). That he could as leader of only a tiny union take a prominent part in the TUC was another tribute to the force of his personality.<br>
