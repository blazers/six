</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bagford,  John</span>  (1650/51&#150;1716), <span class="occ">bookseller and antiquary</span>, was born in Fetter Lane, London, the son of John Bagford. Very little is known about his early life and family background. He was trained and worked as a shoemaker and wrote a little tract about this trade  (BL, Harley MS 5911), but beyond some schooling he did not receive any academic education. Bagford married his wife, Elizabeth, probably in the early 1670s; their son John was born in 1675. From 1686 Bagford was engaged in the book trade around Holborn, collecting and trading books for the great collectors of his day, such as Bishop John Moore of Ely, Robert and Edward Harley, Samuel Pepys, John Woodward, and Sir Hans Sloane. Bagford enjoyed a reputation as a knowledgeable and reliable book runner and formed important friendships with such scholars as Humfrey Wanley, Thomas Baker, and Thomas Hearne. Thus Bagford developed into one of the pioneer bibliographers of the early eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Bagford played a considerable part in a number of antiquarian pursuits of his day. He contributed, for example, to Edmund Gibson's edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> and John Strype's edition of John Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>. In 1707 Bagford was part of a group together with Wanley, William Stukeley, and others who attempted to refound the Society of Antiquaries. In those years Bagford met the antiquary Thomas Hearne at Oxford, and the two developed a close friendship and collaboration. Bagford also wrote antiquarian studies of his own, among them a well-received essay on London antiquities published by Hearne in his edition of Leland's <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> (1715). Bagford supplied Hearne with a considerable amount of material both for his publications and private collections. Both were involved in John Urry's edition of Chaucer (1721). In his <span class="italic">Robert of Gloucester</span> (1724), Hearne published a letter-essay he had written to Bagford earlier about Chaucer editions.<br>
<br>Bagford collected early printed books and ballads mainly for his planned history of printing and the printed book. In search of books, he made a number of trips to the Dutch towns of Haarlem, Leiden, and Amsterdam, where his friend and agent John Bullord had settled as a bookseller. In 1707 proposals for Bagford's work were published as was his essay on the invention of printing, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> together with Wanley's account of Bagford's collections. Apparently the work itself did not attract enough subscribers and it was never completed. Not all his friends were confident that the autodidact Bagford could produce such a study. Wanley, however, admired Bagford's skills in &#145;the different sorts of Ink, Illumination, Binding, Hands, parchment, Papers, or almost any sort of Workmanship&#146;  (Levine, 139). To Hearne<blockquote>there appeared in him such a plain, unaffected, honest simplicity, &amp; at the same time such an unusual skill in the History of Printing &amp; in our own History &amp; Antiquities, that I immediately concluded him to be a valuable Man, as he most certainly is (<span class="italic">Remarks and Collections</span>, 5.74)</blockquote>Hearne published an account of his friend in <span class="italic">Hemingi chartularium</span> (1723). Eventually Bagford's collections were consulted by Joseph Ames for his <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span> (1749).<br>
<br>Today Bagford is known most as a collector of ballads. A great number of the ballads in the famous Roxburghe collection were originally gathered by Bagford for Robert Harley. The <span class="italic">Bagford Ballads</span>, finally edited and published by J. W. Ebsworth in 1878, represent Bagford's private collection of mainly Restoration ballads. His reputation was tarnished by later critics such as William Blades and T. F. Dibdin, who explained the presence in his collections of great amounts of title-pages, fragments, and scraps by accusing him of &#145;biblioclasm&#146;. None of Bagford's contemporaries commented on Bagford tearing title-pages from books. Important work has been done since to rectify this image and to prove in more than one instance that Bagford preserved important fragments rather than mutilated books and manuscripts.<br>
<br>Bagford possibly remarried in 1703, but in his latter days he lived as a pensioner in the Charterhouse, where a place had been procured for him by Bishop Moore. He died in lodgings at Islington on 5 May 1716, the cause of his death unknown. He was buried on 7 May within the precincts of the Charterhouse. After his death, his collections were bought by Edward Harley and a small part of them came to Hearne.<br>
