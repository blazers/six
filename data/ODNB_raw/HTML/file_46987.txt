<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Falk,  Herman Eugene</span>  (1820&#150;1898), <span class="occ">salt manufacturer</span>, was born on 20 November 1820 in Danzig, the fourth of five children of David Wilhelm Falk (1773&#150;1848), merchant, and his second wife, Julianne Rickert. His parents were both German, though his grandfather, he claimed, was English. In 1839 Falk emigrated to England where since 1829 his half-brother, Eduard, and brother, Robert, had been separately in business. Robert's partnerships failed in 1836 and 1840 but Herman invested family capital in Robert's new scheme trading from Liverpool in coal, iron, grain, silk, guano, and salt. Both brothers married into Liverpool commerce, their wives being the daughters of John Thompson, glazier, painter, and plumber; Herman married Elizabeth in 1844, his brother her sister. Elizabeth Falk died after giving birth to her first child (1851). In 1854 Falk married his daughter's governess, Anne Hadfield. The couple had two sons and three daughters. In 1841 the Falks invested in salt works at Winsford, Cheshire, where Herman, as resident manager, mined at record depths. Herman also founded the industry's standard information bulletin, <span class="italic">Falk's Salt Circular</span>.<br>
<br>In 1843 Herman moved to Hull to organize the import of Baltic timber for railway sleepers commissioned by the engineer Robert Stephenson. Business confidence faltered in 1845. Crucial railway contracts were lost. The brothers faced two crippling actions in chancery, one raised by their half-brother. Their partnership, denuded of capital, was dissolved. While Robert maintained businesses in England, Herman in 1846 took up forestry in New Brunswick, Canada. Returning in 1848 he was forced out of Winsford salt works in 1850 through the actions of the salt traders' association, unimpressed by his vacillating attitude to agreements on prices and production. He was arrested for debt, and costly legal actions came eventually into chancery (1850&#150;53). He overcame difficulties, establishing himself at Meadowbank (Winsford) salt works, with Robert as London agent until the latter's bankruptcy in 1856.<br>
<br>Following an economic recession Falk united the major salt proprietors of Cheshire and Worcestershire in a Salt chamber of commerce (1858), whose committee regulated production and prices. In 1860 he successfully advanced the interests of British salt manufacturers at negotiations for the Anglo-French commercial treaty.<br>
<br>Falk claimed that the industry's stability was threatened by the &#145;proletariat element&#146; of family proprietors reducing prices and expanding production. To outmanoeuvre these firms and destroy the business of independent hauliers, he constructed in his own shipyard, from 1863, the River Weaver's first iron steamboats to tow strings of dumb barges. In 1868 a strike of saltworkers forced proprietors to increase wages and reduce hours. Falk stood firm upon economic grounds, replacing his own workers with Germans, hired for low wages in Liverpool while in transit to America. When the Germans in turn &#145;conspired with rebellious spirit&#146;, Falk recruited &#145;docile&#146; Poles and Hungarians to his 350-strong workforce. Falk determined to counter the &#145;gross materialism&#146; of wage demands by providing schooling and housing, though conditions, particularly for foreign workers&#151;criticized by the press and xenophobic locals&#151;were eventually (inconclusively) investigated by the select committee on the emigration and immigration of foreigners (1888).<br>
<br>Falk travelled widely and published papers on the world's salt. He provided evidence to official inquiries of 1873&#150;81 concerning the environmental impact of his salt works, particularly subsidences and noxious acid emissions. He identified labour obstruction and poor coal as factors, reporting that his own model farm at Catsclough in the heart of the salt districts was, through skilful management, flourishing. His authoritative pronouncements delayed compensation legislation until 1891. From 1873 Cheshire's burgeoning chemical industry boosted Falk's business, though competition from Teesside and manufacturing processes independent of salt limited profits. In 1884 Falk devised the first British joint-stock industrial combination, an attempt legitimized by limited liability, to control production and prices. Falk wrote in his annual report for the Salt chamber of commerce (1886&#150;7), 26: &#145;The tendency of the age is for an amalgamation and co-operation of all manufactures, in order to lay the great bully competition&#146;. In 1888 a syndicate, having purchased the majority of salt works in Britain and Ireland for above their market value, converted itself into a limited company, the Salt Union. Falk, who by now enjoyed the popular title &#145;Father of the salt trade&#146;, refused to serve on the board, though his barrister son did. The inefficient combine tottered through strikes and commercial crises until absorbed into Imperial Chemical Industries in 1937.<br>
<br>Falk retired to his farm, Catsclough, Winsford, Cheshire, where, following the death of his second wife, he married in 1894 an engineer's daughter, Alice Stanley. He died at Catsclough on 19 January 1898, leaving his effects to Alice and directing that his body be cremated without a funeral and that mourning should be limited to six months.<br>
