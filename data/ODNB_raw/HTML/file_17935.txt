<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mangnall,  Richmal</span>  (1769&#150;1820), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, the third daughter of James Mangnall of Hollinhurst, Lancashire, and London, and Richmal, daughter of John Kay of Manchester, was born on 7 March 1769, probably in London. She was the fourth of seven children to survive infancy; of her two brothers, the elder, James, became a London solicitor; the younger, Kay, died in the East Indies in 1801. On the death of her parents about 1781 she was adopted by her uncle, John Kay, solicitor, of Manchester, and was educated at Mrs Wilson's school at Crofton Hall, near Wakefield, Yorkshire. She remained there as a teacher, eventually taking over the school herself and running it successfully until her death there on 1 May 1820. She was able to support two unmarried sisters from her school and publishing earnings, and to provide for them after her death. She was buried in Crofton churchyard.<br>
<br>Crofton Hall was a flourishing school with over seventy pupils. A system of questions and answers allowed teachers or senior pupils to conduct large classes, and Richmal Mangnall's <span class="italic">Historical and Miscellaneous Questions for the Use of Young People</span> was first published anonymously in 1798 to serve her own school. Longmans bought the copyright for 100 guineas; their 1800 edition, still anonymous, is dedicated to John Kay. Successive editions appeared almost annually, with the author's corrections and additions incorporating recent events, including a new section on astronomy in the edition of 1806, dedicated to the astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne. Richmal Mangnall also published <span class="italic">Half an Hour's Lounge, or, Poems</span> (1805), which she described as &#145;trifles&#146;; they treated such themes as nature, the sorrow of parting, Laura and Petrarch, Mrs Opie, and, in a poem entitled &#145;To the Memory of an Officer in the Honorable East-India Company's Service, 1801&#146;, the death of her brother. A <span class="italic">Compendium of Geography for the Use of Schools</span> (1815) had more limited success than her <span class="italic">Questions</span>.<br>
<br>In 1888 a satirical writer wondered how people had learned before the &#145;immortal textbook&#146;, and placed it between the <span class="italic">Lyrical Ballads</span> of 1798 and <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span> in 1802 as ushering in a new era. Certainly, the catechism-type textbook dominated Victorian school-publishing, and Mangnall's <span class="italic">Questions</span> continued to appear until late in the century, albeit revised, corrected, updated, and supplemented by such editors as William Pinnock in mid-century and G. N. Wright in 1875. Richmal Mangnall's declared purpose (Preface, 1806) was that the <span class="italic">Questions</span> should serve to &#145;awaken a spirit of laudible [<i>sic</i>] curiosity&#146;, but it is doubtful whether the formulation of the questions (strictly from a teacher's rather than a learner's perspective) and the finality of the answers achieved this purpose. It is to Mangnall, no doubt, that the contemporary <span class="italic">Blair's Universal Preceptor and Questions</span> refers in contrasting its &#145;intellectual or thinking system&#146; with &#145;popular mechanical systems&#146;; despite these criticisms, the predominant textbook format remained interrogative, and the more mechanical or catechetical systems, incorporating Mangnall, were highly valued where the knowledge of the teacher, whether governess or school monitor, was itself limited.<br>
