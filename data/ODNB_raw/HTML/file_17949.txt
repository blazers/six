<span class="headword">Mann,  William</span>  (1817&#150;1873), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 25 October 1817 at Lewisham, Kent, the third son of Major-General Cornelius Mann RE. He was educated privately and in 1830 went with his family to Gibraltar, where his father had been appointed commander of the Royal Engineers. Regulations prevented him from following an elder brother into the engineers' college, as he had wished, and he obtained the post of second assistant at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, under Thomas Maclear, where he arrived, after preliminary training, on 22 October 1839. Maclear intended to remeasure the meridian arc surveyed by the French astronomer Lacaille in 1751&#150;3, as its accuracy was now in doubt; Mann took out some of the apparatus necessary for this task, which required a base-line to be measured with great precision, from where a series of distant points were to be triangulated along a north&#150;south meridian, its ends astronomically surveyed for latitude. Mann was engaged on this task for six years, often working in remote areas without proper provisions or shelter.<br>
<br>In 1846 Mann was promoted to first assistant in place of Charles Piazzi Smyth, who was appointed astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. A few months later he fell from his horse, suffering head injuries which plagued him for the remainder of his life. After a few months' leave in England to recuperate, he returned to take up the duties of an astronomer. In October 1852 he again travelled to London, where he learned the mechanical details of a new transit circle being constructed by Troughton and Simms and supervised its packing for the journey to the Cape. He arrived back in December 1853. The cases containing the new circle reached the Cape early in 1854, and Mann directed its erection and adjustment. Mann's dedication and efficiency had by this time so impressed Maclear that in 1854 he was permitted to marry Caroline, the Maclears' second daughter.<br>
<br>In 1863 Mann declined the post of government astronomer at Sydney, perhaps hoping that the astronomer royal, George Biddell Airy, would support Maclear's wish that Mann should succeed him at the Cape. But Airy was unwilling to concede what he saw as nepotism, and when Maclear finally resigned, in 1870, Mann was considered too old, and perhaps too unwell, to embark on the long-desired major project, a catalogue of southern stars. He had sought relief from a chest infection in Natal in 1866 and in England in 1867. In 1870 an epidemic of scarlet fever struck the observatory families; two of Mann's children succumbed and Mann himself was grievously ill. He was belatedly elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in March 1871. He retired in 1872 and died at Claremont, near Cape Town, on 30 April 1873. A small civil-list pension, which had been granted shortly before his death, was paid to his widow for three years.<br>
<br>Mann was perhaps unfortunate in not having the opportunity for advancement. Maclear's opinion of him had been voiced during his absence in 1846:<blockquote>His powerful intellect, unflinching integrity, and his industry enable me to trust him with confidence on all occasions and in every department, whether at the observatory or on the triangulation, being certain that whatever is practicable he will accomplish, and that what he does will be sure to be well done. (Warner, 62)</blockquote>
