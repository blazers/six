<span class="headword">Mainwaring, Sir  Philip</span>  (1589&#150;1661), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was born in 1589, probably in Cheshire, the fourth and youngest son of Sir Randall (or Randle) Mainwaring (<i>d</i>. 1612), of Over Peover, Cheshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir Edward Fitton, president of Connaught. In 1609 he was a student of Gray's Inn and on 29 August 1610 he matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford. He may have been the Philip Mainwaring who graduated BA on 8 February 1613. His upbringing and career suggest that his protestant beliefs were mainstream.<br>
<br>Mainwaring appears to have served as a useful contact at court for provincial gentry, being described in 1610 as &#145;my Lord Chancellor's man&#146;  (V. Larminie, <span class="italic">Wealth, Kinship and Culture</span>, 1995, 131). In the second half of the 1610s he worked in the Netherlands as an agent for Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, some of his correspondence with whom on political affairs has been printed. The possibility that he brought the earl Sebastiano del Piombo's painting <span class="italic">Ferry Carondolet and Attendants</span>, purchased in 1617, has been noted, as also that Mainwaring's knowledge of this work might have influenced the style of the Van Dyck portrait of himself and Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, painted in 1639 or 1640  (Howarth, 69). It is possible that his work for Arundel brought him into contact with Wentworth, who was on good terms with the earl during the 1620s and early 1630s, and who brought Philip's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70467/', "Edmund Mainwaring (b. 1579, d. in or after 1643)")</script> on to the council of the north and the northern recusancy commission.<br>
<br>By 1629 Mainwaring had begun to report court news and foreign affairs to Wentworth and to keep him abreast of developments that might concern Wentworth's interests, but a bid in July 1632 to serve under Wentworth in a northern office&#151;apparently an ambitious attempt to gain the vice-presidency of the council of the north&#151;was unsuccessful. Mainwaring spent part of 1633 travelling in France. Wentworth's decision in 1634 to appoint him to the post of Irish secretary as a replacement for the elderly Sir Dudley Norton was very much against the advice of one of his allies, Francis, Lord Cottington. Although willing to approach the king with Wentworth's request, Cottington reminded Wentworth that he had himself been critical of Mainwaring in the past. Wentworth's key ally, Archbishop Laud, was less hostile, but was sufficiently concerned to inform Wentworth of Cottington's words on this matter. Mainwaring's appointment on 16 June 1634 brought him membership of the Irish privy council and a knighthood a few weeks later, on 13 July: he evidently served Wentworth well&#151;their portrait is testimony to a good relationship.<br>
<br>Mainwaring was not returned as MP for Steyning, Sussex, in 1621 and 1624, despite Arundel's best efforts, but he sat for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, in the parliaments of 1624, 1625, and 1626, possibly due to duchy of Lancaster influence, and for Derby in 1628. In 1625 he was a member of a Commons committee handling a bill for the sale and settlement of the late earl of Dorset's estate. He was returned as MP for Clonakilty, co. Cork, in the Irish parliament of 1634 and for Carysfort, co. Wicklow, in 1640. He sat for Morpeth, Northumberland, in the Short Parliament of 1640, and spoke on 23 April, urging the Commons to follow the Irish parliament in its generosity towards the king. He remained in office following Strafford's execution and was resident in Dublin until at least August 1641.<br>
<br>Mainwaring spent the first half of 1642 in London embroiled in a contest with Viscount Mountnorris over the office of secretary and in a dispute with Viscount Loftus regarding land entrusted to Mainwaring, among others, in 1638. He left London in June 1642 and settled in Oxford, where he served Charles I as a receiver of revenue. He claimed to have had no military involvement in the civil war. His entire estate was lost during the rebellion and war in Ireland, but he continued to be pursued by Loftus's heirs until the Restoration. He spent part of 1650 and 1651 in prison following his return to London. In 1660 Mainwaring petitioned Charles II for the mastership of the Charterhouse, but was only awarded the reversion on the death of Sir Ralph Sydenham, the successful candidate. In 1661 he was returned as MP for Newton borough, Lancashire, while living with relatives at Baddiley, Cheshire, but he died in London on 2 August of that year. He never married, although rumour briefly linked him with the widowed countess of Berkshire  (Gruenfelder, 83).<br>
