<span class="headword">Baring,  Evelyn</span>, first earl of Cromer  (1841&#150;1917), <span class="occ">diplomatist and proconsul</span>, was born on 26 February 1841 at Cromer Hall, Norfolk, the ninth son of Henry Baring (1776&#150;1848), banker, and his second wife, Cecilia Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Windham (<i>d</i>. 1874). He was a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1382/', "Sir Francis Baring (1740&#150;1810)")</script>, who, with his brother John, had established Barings Bank in London. The families of both of Henry Baring's elder brothers, Thomas and Alexander, were established in the peerage under the titles of Northbrook and Ashburton. Evelyn Baring was thus born into a large, successful, and well-connected cousinhood. His elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38281/', "Edward Charles Baring (1828&#150;1897)")</script>, who became head of Barings Bank, entered the House of Lords as Lord Revelstoke in 1885. But as the youngest son of a father who died when he was seven, Evelyn was not marked out for a public career and it is interesting that he was not directed towards the family bank. Instead he was sent at the age of eleven to the Ordnance School at Carshalton, in preparation for a military career. At fourteen he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, but only after his mother had used her influence with Lord Raglan, the commander-in-chief, to overcome his rejection on grounds of poor eyesight. In 1858, at the age of seventeen, he was posted to Corfu, then a British protectorate, began learning Greek and Italian, and opened his long acquaintance with the eastern Mediterranean. After a short interval he returned to the island as an aide to the governor, Sir Henry Storks. Baring followed Storks to Malta and then to Jamaica for the inquiry into the insurrection there in 1865.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Without the financial independence required for a sideways move towards a parliamentary or diplomatic career, Baring sought advancement in the army. He entered the Staff College in 1868 and passed out first in 1870. In the War Office topographical department (the forerunner of military intelligence) he studied the military capability of the Prussian, Russian, and Turkish armies. But perhaps the crucial influence on the direction of his subsequent official career was his role in supplying a brief for the abolition of the purchase system to which the Liberal government of 1868&#150;74 was committed. The junior minister at the War Office whom Baring served so loyally, at some risk to his professional prospects, was his cousin Lord Northbrook. When the viceroy of India, Lord Mayo, was murdered in 1872, and Northbrook was rushed out to succeed him, Baring went with him as private secretary.<br>
<br>Baring's four years in India before Northbrook resigned in protest against Disraeli's Afghan policy were an important apprenticeship. As Northbrook's confidant, he saw at first hand the workings of an administrative system notoriously centralized and half drowned in paper. He was exposed to the powerful Anglo-Indian ideology of guardianship towards the rural cultivator, then at a vital stage in its formulation. And, with Northbrook's resignation, he had good reason to reflect upon the cross purposes of British and Indian interests in Asia and the difficulties of dealing with far-away ministers with very different political preoccupations. At the same time &#145;the Vice-Viceroy&#146; (as he was revealingly nicknamed) had begun to display the brusque self-confidence and certainty in opinion which became his trademarks in later life. Professional laurels, close proximity to viceregal power, and a sense of embattled rectitude first in London, then in Simla, had transformed the easy-going youth posted out to Corfu nearly twenty years earlier.<h2>
<a name="FirstmarriageandEgypt"></a>First marriage, and Egypt</h2>Returning to Britain, Baring married, on 28 June 1876, Ethel Stanley (<i>d</i>. 16 Oct 1898), daughter and coheir of Sir Rowland Stanley Errington, eleventh baronet; they had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30585/', "Rowland Thomas Baring (1877&#150;1953)")</script> and Windham. Baring resumed work at the War Office and perhaps intended to settle in London. However, the financial crisis in Egypt brought an unexpected opportunity. In 1876 the ruler of Egypt (known as the khedive or viceroy) had set up a debt commission to reassure the largest foreign lenders, who were mainly British or French, and restore confidence in Egypt's public finances. He had sought the advice of G. J. Goschen, a former Liberal cabinet minister and a recognized expert on international finance. Goschen was asked to recommend a British member to the debt commission. At the suggestion of Sir Louis Mallet, a senior official at the India Office, he recommended Baring&#151;though it is not unlikely that Baring's name added to his appeal from the khedive's point of view. Despite some private reservations Baring accepted the appointment. Once in Cairo he quickly discovered the ambiguous status of the commission's authority and the difficulties of co-operating with the Egyptian government.<br>
<br>The heart of the problem lay in the commission's determination to rein in the extravagance of the khedival court and to reduce public expenditure drastically to help meet the soaring debt charges already incurred. The commission proposed to take half the khedive's vast estates into public ownership, and to halve the army. A policy of savage deflation in 1878&#150;9 aggravated the social effects of a rural famine. Isma&#145;il, the khedive, with a throne to lose, pursued the dangerous tactic of encouraging local opposition to the commission while simultaneously posing as its champion abroad. When in April 1879 he dismissed his ministers and effectively repudiated the commission, Baring resigned and went home. But he was back almost immediately. Isma&#145;il's erratic policy had finally united the great powers against him, and his nominal sovereign, the Ottoman sultan, formally dethroned him in June. Baring returned to Cairo as one of two controllers-general in the second phase of Egypt's financial crisis, the Anglo-French &#145;dual control&#146; of 1879&#150;82.<h2>
<a name="InIndia"></a>In India</h2>But not for long. The &#145;Midlothian election&#146; of 1880 had swept the Conservatives from office, and a Liberal ministry appointed a Liberal viceroy to India: Lord Ripon. Baring's Indian experience, his Egyptian credentials as a zealous champion of sound finance, and his political connections with the Liberal Party&#151;he had briefly thought of standing as a Liberal in East Norfolk&#151;made him an obvious appointment to the post of finance member of the government of India. Like the viceroyalty itself, this post (the equivalent of the chancellorship of the exchequer) was usually filled by a nominee from home rather than by a British career administrator in the Indian Civil Service. The reasoning was plain enough. Indian financial policy was an imperial question: the cost of the 60,000 British troops in India and the interest payable on India's sterling loans were the first charges on Indian revenues. Moreover, the recurrent threat of a revenue tariff to prop up India's rickety finances was anathema to the British commercial interests (especially in cotton manufacture) vociferously represented in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Baring's three-year term as finance member was not, however, an unqualified success. He maintained a regular correspondence with Sir Louis Mallet, the India Office financial expert and one of his patrons. As an outsider in the Anglo-Indian official hierarchy, Baring was contemptuous of its self-interested conservatism. An Indian reform bill was needed, he told Mallet on 19 February 1881:<blockquote>The natives must be admitted to a larger share in their own affairs &hellip; we cannot go on for long governing this huge country through the agency of seven men meeting twice a week around a green baize table and doing practically what they choose. (Mowat, 63)</blockquote>Baring's preferred solution was to reinforce the influence of home opinion against the vested interest of local British officialdom, whom he dismissed as a &#145;clique of third-rate Englishmen&#146;, and to widen Indian participation in government beyond what he called the &#145;Baboos&#146;.<br>
<br>Baring combined these traces of radical Liberalism with devotion to Gladstonian precepts in public finance. In his third budget he swept away the duties on imported cotton goods which offended free trade sentiment in Britain. But when he proposed to replace them by increased direct taxation, including an income tax, the viceroy grew restive. Baring, he complained, was a &#145;doctrinaire&#146; with little sense of how to prepare the ground for his ideas. Faced with Ripon's opposition, Baring performed a rapid volte-face, abandoned the income tax, and now declared himself in favour of gradualist reform in local government. &#145;We shall not subvert the British Empire&#146;, he told Mallet with only a trace of irony, &#145;by allowing the Bengali Baboo to discuss his own schools and drains. Rather shall we afford a safety-valve if we turn his attention to these innocuous subjects&#146;  (Mowat, 83).<br>
<br>These three years in India might be seen as a watershed in Baring's public career and political attitudes. For all his energy, self-confidence, and moral rectitude in the face of Anglo-Indian mediocrity and inertia (as he doubtless saw it), he had made little impression on the system of Indian government. Instead he had earned the reputation of an arrogant doctrinaire. Not for the last time, he had avoided defeat by a timely U-turn. But perhaps the experience left its mark. The great characteristic of Baring's later career in Egypt was his flexibility in dealing with his superiors in London, and his careful avoidance of irretrievable positions. From being a doctrinaire, he became a <i>politique</i>, whose firmness of language rarely closed the door to compromise or retreat. His bruising encounter with the Anglo-Indian official machine may have persuaded him that wide discretion on a smaller stage was preferable to the niggling constraints and perpetual intrigue inseparable from grander authority. Finally, although the transition was gradual, and Baring himself, consciously or otherwise, veiled the change, his second tour in India marked a shift away from an enthusiastic radicalism in imperial attitudes towards a world-weary cynicism about the capacity of &#145;Eastern peoples&#146; to attain the moral and intellectual qualities needed for self-government. It is ironic that for all his declared antipathy to the Anglo-Indian ethos, Baring gradually came to embody, certainly by the last years of his life, all the characteristic prejudices invoked to justify the indefinite prolongation of imperial rule. He was made KCSI in August 1883.<h2>
<a name="Consulgeneral"></a>Consul-general</h2>In these circumstances the offer of the consulship-general in Cairo to Baring early in 1883 may have come as a relief to him, to the viceroy, and to his colleagues. The post was an oddity. Its humble designation reflected Egypt's formal international status as a viceroyalty of the Ottoman empire and not a sovereign state. In substance, however, the consul-general occupied a diplomatic post of acute political sensitivity and importance. Since 1880, when Baring had left for India, Egypt had passed through a double revolution. The attempt by Britain and France to maintain the so-called dual control over Egyptian finance, to restore Egyptian solvency and to ward off intervention by other powers, had finally collapsed in the nationalist revolt led by Arabi Pasha against the discredited authority of the khedive Tawfiq. In a confused situation that appeared to threaten the lives and property of the large (mainly Greek) foreign community, the financial interests of British, French, and other European bondholders, and Britain's strategic interest in the Suez Canal, the Gladstone government had decided on military intervention. In September 1882 a British force under Wolseley dispersed Arabi's army, revived the khedive's authority, and established Britain's &#145;temporary occupation&#146; in Egypt. But when it came to deciding how British supremacy should be used and how long it should last, the Gladstone government was at sixes and sevens. Most ministers, including Gladstone himself, were determined not to be trapped into a permanent occupation, let alone annexation, fearing the financial, military, and diplomatic liabilities this would impose. On the other hand, they could hardly withdraw without making some provision for stable government in Egypt and for a financial recovery programme with better prospects than those which had repeatedly broken down between 1876 and 1882.<br>
<br>The initial reaction of the cabinet was to dispatch an envoy (Lord Dufferin) to draw up a comprehensive scheme of political reform which, once instituted, would permit early British withdrawal. Not surprisingly, a solution conceived in cabinet compromise had little relevance to local conditions, since Egyptian willingness to enact a &#145;British&#146; scheme was unlikely to survive British departure. This was the circle which it was Baring's task to square: to uphold the commitment to an early withdrawal while simultaneously imposing on the Egyptian government the drastic administrative reforms required to reduce the public debt and pay off the foreign bondholders. All this had to be done without recourse to overt political control by annexation or by the creation of a protectorate, and without infringing the diplomatic interests and extra-territorial privileges of other European powers and communities in the country.<br>
<br>Even for an official of Baring's skill and experience, this was an exceptionally difficult hand to play, especially given the inconstancy of cabinet policy in London. His main advantage lay, perhaps, not in previous knowledge of Egypt and the financial expertise recently tested in India, but in the facility with which he adopted the ambivalent attitude required by London's policy. While he became increasingly convinced that reform in Egypt would be a long and arduous process, Baring was careful to speak the language of early and eager withdrawal. At the same time he grasped that while London would reject any commitment to an extended stay, it would accept the logic of forcefully supporting his own influence on the Egyptian government&#151;the prerequisite, Baring insisted, for the very reforms that would liberate the Liberal cabinet from its &#145;bondage in Egypt&#146;. &#145;I am really beginning to think&#146;, he told Northbrook on 23 December 1883, &#145;that the more power we assume temporarily, the better the chance of getting away in the end&#146;  (Mowat, 124). Thus the foreign secretary, Lord Granville, authorized the doctrine in 1884 that no Egyptian minister opposed to Baring's reforms could be allowed to stay in office. With infinite subtlety and reassuring rhetoric, Baring, with his unimpeachable Liberal credentials, drew his political masters steadily deeper into an effective political guarantee that there would be no withdrawal before the reform policy was complete. Precisely when, in Baring's own mind, the ides of March became the Greek calends is uncertain and perhaps unknowable. Perhaps it was only the arrival of Lord Salisbury in office in 1886 that encouraged him to resolve the ambiguities he had carefully cherished.<br>
<br>But before this more settled policy in London took shape Baring had passed through the political ordeal of the Sudan crisis, which culminated in the death of Gordon at Khartoum and Egypt's humiliating expulsion from its colony on the upper Nile. Egypt's own political upheavals after 1875 coincided with and contributed to the upsurge of Sudanese opposition to Egyptian control, which had been fastened on the region since the early nineteenth century. By 1883, the year of Baring's arrival as consul-general, the Mahdist revolt was in full spate. Baring, like the two governments he sought to guide, had to decide whether the Sudan should be retained and if so, how. There can be no doubt that this episode was the most painful and embarrassing of Baring's entire career. In later life he liked to stress that his own preference had been to concentrate on Egypt's financial recovery, which futile expenditure on the Sudanese struggle could only delay and perhaps wreck. But he also knew that to lose the Sudan would be a staggering blow to the khedival regime and threaten its partnership with Britain. Hence his advice to London, and even his attitude to the controversial matter of Gordon's appointment as governor-general with a mandate to save the Sudan, were marked by the vacillation and uncertainty which he liked to condemn in others. Having recommended the evacuation of the Sudan and opposed Gordon's dispatch, he changed his mind and enthusiastically endorsed Gordon's mission. When Gordon was besieged, Baring pressed the Gladstone government to send a relief expedition. Perhaps in reaction to his own involvement in an affair of such public horror and shame, Baring became deeply disillusioned (in a way later echoed in his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Milner) with the defects of party government and especially with Gladstone personally. He came to loathe what he saw as Gladstone's confident omniscience and the facility of speech which gave it full rein. There was scarcely a subject, he remarked later, which did not attract Gladstone's attention and on which he did not seem impelled &#145;to form decided opinions &hellip; and to let the world know what those opinions were&#146;, regardless of whether they were built on a foundation of knowledge  (Zetland, 123). By contrast, the realism, irony, wit, and cynicism which were the trademarks of Salisbury's correspondence would have been welcome to Baring's own declared preference (if not invariable practice) for calling a spade a spade.<h2>
<a name="Egyptianreforms"></a>Egyptian reforms</h2>Indeed, between 1886 and 1892, with the assurance of firmer political support at home, Baring was able to dig the foundations of British control in Egypt rather more deeply. By 1889 the vacillation and uncertainty which had made the duration of the British presence so unpredictable began to clear away with the rise of the new doctrine of British predominance in the Nile valley. Baring's success in restoring Egyptian solvency contributed to the easing of the diplomatic pressure on London; simultaneously it reduced the necessity to negotiate with the other powers for a relaxation of the extra-territorial taxation privileges enjoyed by their subjects&#151;long a source of rankling irritation among British officials. Baring could now set about turning the emergency regime of 1883&#150;6 into something more robust. From the debris of successive experiments in foreign supervision, financial intervention, and dual control since 1875, he fashioned a system in which the form of an autonomous Egyptian government was carefully preserved. But its operations at every important level (including sub-provincial administration) were carefully shadowed by a phalanx of British inspectors and advisers who reported to the Egyptian ministers but also (no doubt in different terms) to him. In certain key departments, such as finance, officials were seconded from Britain to provide bureaucratic &#145;stiffening&#146;; Milner served as under-secretary for finance between 1889 and 1892. The police and legal system were closely watched through the interior adviser, the judicial adviser, and the inspector-general of police. But the ultimate guarantee of British influence, apart from the British garrison of some 6000 men, was firm control of the Egyptian army. The old army which had revolted under Arabi's leadership was dispersed. The new army was organized along Indian lines with (some) British officers and a British <i>sirdar</i> or commander-in-chief. Here, it might be thought, was the best evidence that the &#145;temporary occupation&#146; was indeed a &#145;veiled protectorate&#146;.<br>
<br>But the keystone of this elaborate political edifice was the role of Baring himself. In keeping with the fundamental ambivalence running through his imperial thinking, Baring played two parts. On the one hand, as the diplomatic representative of the dominant European power in the eastern Mediterranean and on the Nile, his progresses through Cairo were of almost viceregal splendour: an elegant carriage accompanied by running grooms with white wands and flying sleeves. Baring himself was a large man of somewhat intimidating mien, and with a notoriously brusque manner: &#145;Well, is there anything else?&#146; signalled the end of an interview. In Egypt, the Vice-Viceroy became &#145;the Lord&#146; or &#145;al-Lurd&#146;. On the other hand, he was at pains to conceal as far as possible the brutal fact of British control over the Egyptian government by insisting that he remain the &#145;whisper behind the throne&#146;, playing no public part in the conduct of Egypt's internal affairs. In reality, of course, Baring intended that the khedive and his ministers should know that he enjoyed the full confidence of the British government and that, in the last resort, he, and they, would not hesitate to remove ministers, or even a ruler, who defied their wishes. To sustain this conjuring trick of interventionist non-intervention required not only close surveillance of every move by the khedive or his ministers, but also a very firm grip upon the British officials in Egypt whose arrogance or exuberance periodically threatened an awkward political breakdown and perhaps even embarrassed disavowal in London.<br>
<br>From this can be seen, in the highly unusual political and diplomatic conditions prevailing in Egypt, the extent to which the successful functioning of the British occupation rested upon Baring's unique assemblage of personal talents and expertise. He had been by turns private secretary, staff officer, diplomat, and finance minister. He had excellent political contacts in London. He was a radical Liberal on the turn with a language to match. He had a forceful temperament and wide administrative experience. Above all, he had a shrewd sense of diplomatic and political realities and a commanding manner essential to his dealings not only with the Egyptian court but also with his own &#145;subordinates&#146;&#151;the British officials in Egypt. Perhaps it was the fact that he had built the occupation regime around himself, and exercised such full control over it, that explains both Baring's indispensability and his reluctance to accept more glamorous appointments with less real power.<h2>
<a name="Difficulties"></a>Difficulties</h2>Even so, the system that Baring had constructed by 1892 was far from invulnerable. In 1893&#150;4 it was plunged into crisis. The circumstances are revealing of the strengths and weaknesses of his regime. Two events signalled the onset of political turbulence. The first was the death in January 1892 of the khedive Tawfiq, placed and re-placed on the throne by the British in 1879 and 1882. Tawfiq was succeeded by Abbas II for whom Baring had initially felt considerable liking. But the change on the Egyptian throne was bound to have an unsettling effect on the triangle of Egyptian politics with its dynastic, landowning, and British components. The long struggle between the ruler and the landowning class for control of land, revenue, and administrative patronage was a political fact of great convenience to the British. But periodically the Egyptian parties sought to readjust the balance, usually by exploiting anti-foreign sentiment. This was Abbas's tactic. The second event may have encouraged him: the replacement of Salisbury by the fourth Gladstone ministry in 1892 and the possibility that Baring's political authority might be undermined by Liberal indecision in London.<br>
<br>Abbas's initial challenge alarmed Baring (who had been raised to the peerage on 20 June 1892 as Baron Cromer of Cromer), but had little success. He defied the unwritten rule of Anglo-Egyptian relations by appointing a new prime minister without consulting Cromer and chose a notorious Anglophobe. Cromer's reaction was predictably severe. He demanded from London permission if necessary to occupy government buildings in Cairo using the British garrison. As Abbas might have suspected, this request had a mixed reception in the Gladstone cabinet, where some ministers, including Sir William Harcourt, feared that Cromer would drag Britain into complications with the other powers. Rosebery, the foreign secretary, was forced to concede that Cromer's attitude was &#145;injudicious&#146;  (Rosebery to Queen Victoria, 18 Jan 1893, Crewe, 419); nevertheless, he secured authority to veto Abbas's choice and to reinforce the British garrison. Cromer had won the first round. But he was full of foreboding that &#145;this foolish boy&#146; had smashed the old system whereby British influence was kept from public view and the proprieties of formal autonomy maintained.<br>
<br>Nor was it long before Abbas made a further attempt to roll back the frontiers of British control. Through a new prime minister, sanctioned by Cromer, he attacked the consul-general's eyes and ears. British advisers were denied information and access to the council of ministers. Resentment at the reforms imposed at British request on the courts and police was turned against the foreign power. &#145;Nine-tenths&#146; of the official class was thoroughly hostile, Cromer warned Rosebery on 25 December 1893  (Mowat, 204). The legislative council, in which the landowning class was largely represented, took its cue and passed a motion calling for British withdrawal. But the climax of Abbas's campaign was his attempt to neutralize the mainspring of British control: the British garrison and British supervision of the Egyptian army. In January 1894, as a clear hint to the Egyptian officer corps, Abbas publicly criticized Kitchener, who was <i>sirdar</i>. This, however, was precisely the open challenge for which Cromer had been waiting. Kitchener resigned, but it was immediately clear that London would treat Abbas's move as a threat of direct confrontation. Abbas drew back, recanted, and Kitchener was reinstated. The crisis gradually subsided.<br>
<br>Thereafter Abbas showed no further inclination to subvert Cromer's authority. But Cromer himself was pessimistic about the survival of his system. He pressed Rosebery unsuccessfully to declare a British protectorate for ten to fifteen years. He gradually increased the number of British officials and established in 1902 a system for their regular recruitment into the Egyptian civil service. Gloomily, he forecast that Britain would have to choose between going &#145;forward&#146;&#151;annexation&#151;or going &#145;back&#146;&#151;evacuation. His view of Egypt's own potential for political progress became harsher. Not unlike the Anglo-Indians he had despised fifteen years earlier, he came to regard the principal fault of &#145;oriental&#146; politicians as their lack of moral character&#151;a failing which could not be remedied by any known curriculum and which was always likely to recur when tested for. As the &#145;temporary occupation&#146; took on some of the features of a more typical colonial regime, it increasingly drew its legitimacy, at least in the eyes of British opinion, from its claim to accomplish improving public works, especially in irrigation and drainage, and to uphold the interests of rural cultivators against the urban, commercial, and educated classes.<br>
<br>In large part, Cromer's extreme sensitivity to any symptom of political unrest in Egypt derived from the fear that it would encourage other European powers to reassert their extra-territorial rights and national interests&#151;rights and interests for which the British claimed to act as a <i>de facto</i> trustee. Serious political unrest would set off not merely a crisis in Anglo-Egyptian relations, but also an international crisis which would test the nerve and resolution of a Liberal ministry at home to their limits. It was this same fear which dictated his often inconsistent approach to the problem of the Sudan, which had been only temporarily shelved by the Mahdist triumph of 1885 and the death of Gordon. Cromer's reluctance to embark on a reconquest is well known: he was fearful of the financial consequences of the effort, and of the political consequences of failure. But he was also acutely concerned with what was to happen when, as was generally expected, the Mahdist regime eventually collapsed. Already by 1889 he had signalled to Salisbury his nervousness that the growing Italian presence in north-east Africa might allow them to reach Khartoum before Britain could react to events on the upper Nile. Salisbury expressed agreement, but it is not clear how seriously he took the warnings of the importunate proconsul. A year later Cromer convinced himself that Mahdist power was about to disintegrate, and gained Salisbury's approval for a limited advance by the Egyptian army. It was a miscalculation, and the advance was halted. But it was the same sequence of pressure from Cromer and grudging agreement in London which led five years later to the establishment of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium in the Sudan.<br>
<br>On that occasion Cromer exploited Salisbury's willingness, partly for reasons of European diplomacy, to make a small gesture in support of Italian difficulties in Ethiopia. In March 1896 he persuaded Salisbury to enlarge the gesture by letting Kitchener invade the Sudan as far as Dongola. At first the omens were favourable: it seemed that Mahdist resistance would crumble quickly if the impetus of the advance was maintained. But a Mahdist counter-attack belied his optimism. In the autumn of 1897 Cromer lost his nerve. The reconquest of Khartoum, he wrote, was &#145;beyond the military and financial resources of the Egyptian Government &hellip; I tear my hair over the hurried decision of March 1896&#146;  (Sanderson, 261). Cromer now wanted to stand pat at Berber and opposed calling for British troops for which Egypt would have to pay and over whose disposition his own control would be limited. Circumstances forced his hand. By December 1897 Kitchener's position at Berber was so alarming that Cromer himself insisted that British reinforcements must be sought. From that moment on the argument for an advance to Khartoum became irresistible, since both strategic and financial reasons dictated the decisive use and swift withdrawal of the imperial contingent. On 2 September 1898, at Omdurman, Kitchener, with a mixed army of British and Egyptian troops, demolished the Mahdist state. The following month, on 16 October, Cromer's wife died.<br>
<br>For Cromer the British hand in the reconquest of the Sudan was a mixed blessing. It was a fixed point in his thinking that his system of covert supremacy in Egypt depended upon his own complete control over all the agencies of British influence. A British-ruled Sudan, with its own governor-general answerable to the colonial secretary in London, was anathema: not only would it undermine his influence in Cairo, but also it was certain to enrage a wide spectrum of Egyptian opinion. The eccentric regime invented for the Sudan in 1899 bore the marks of Cromer's will. It was not annexed but became a condominium&#151;the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan&#151;in which, technically, control was shared between the British and Egyptian governments. Its affairs, like those of Egypt, were supervised in London by the Foreign not the Colonial office. As if to hammer home the peculiar circumstances of its conquest, the British <i>sirdar</i> of the Egyptian army became <i>ex officio</i> the governor-general of Sudan, tying its administration securely into the network of British officials through whom the consul-general exerted his ubiquitous oversight. Thus British rule in the Sudan, like British influence in Egypt, was adapted to the Cromer &#145;system&#146;.<h2>
<a name="SecondmarriageandlastyearsinEgypt"></a>Second marriage and last years in Egypt</h2>Cromer was to spend eight more years as consul-general. Having been made a viscount in January 1899, he was created earl of Cromer on 8 August 1901. In the same year he married on 22 October Lady Katherine Georgiana Louisa (1865&#150;1933), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27422/', "John Alexander Thynne, fourth marquess of Bath (1831&#150;1896)")</script>, and his wife, Frances. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30789/', "(Charles) Evelyn Baring (1903&#150;1973)")</script> became a well-known colonial governor and in 1960 was created first Baron Howick of Glendale.<br>
<br>This was the period in which British predominance in the Nile valley was consolidated administratively and diplomatically. The successful negotiation of the Anglo-French entente in 1904, the details of which required constant reference to Cromer, marked the end of France's prolonged diplomatic campaign to evict the British from Egypt and, from Cromer's point of view, served to puncture any surviving illusion in Egypt politics that a foreign power would help restore its independence. But Cromer did not succeed in abolishing the extra-territorial privileges of the European powers&#151;the great encumbrance which prevented the British from reshaping the political and financial regime in ways that might have widened their choice of local allies. Thus when Cromer retired in 1907 he bequeathed a system of influence which, in its essentials, was still precariously dependent upon the consul-general's ability to exercise a form of personal supremacy over the Egyptian ruler, the leading politicians, the ramifying network of British officialdom, and&#151;not least&#151;his superiors in London. Egypt's subsequent history showed how few of his successors could bend the bow of Ulysses. Indeed Cromer's own retirement took place under a cloud. The savage and disproportionate punishment meted out to the peasants involved in the notorious fracas at Dinshawai in July 1906, in the course of which a British officer had died, created a grim and bitter political atmosphere in Egypt and even aroused official misgivings in Britain. Cromer's insensitivity to this reaction suggests that in the last phase of his career in Egypt he drew his advisers and opinions from a narrow and perhaps sycophantic circle.<h2>
<a name="Publicationsandfinalyears"></a>Publications and final years</h2>Cromer returned home in poor health and a depressed state, though the king had made him a member of the Order of Merit in 1906. Quite soon, however, the literary instincts which he had shown as a young staff officer were revived in a series of books and articles. In 1908 he published his apologia under the magnificent title of <span class="italic">Modern Egypt</span>, one of the classic works of Victorian imperialist writing. In <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Imperialism</span> (1910) he combined his passions for classical literature and contemporary affairs. In his speeches in the House of Lords, and in the articles eventually collected in his <span class="italic">Political and Literary Essays</span> (published in three series in 1913, 1915, and 1916), he revisited the broader themes of imperial rule he had debated energetically with Sir Louis Mallet some thirty years before. Like many of his contemporaries, Cromer was now convinced that the future lay in great political conglomerates of which the British empire must be one: on those grounds he condemned as &#145;suicidal&#146; any weakening of the Anglo-Irish union  (Cromer, &#145;Speech at Unionist Free Trade Club, 2 June 1908&#146;, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 1.275). He was confident that non-Western societies could not withstand the stresses of Western influence and must succumb to Western domination. He rejected what he called &#145;excessive earth-hunger&#146; but insisted that a &#145;sound but reasonable imperialist&#146; should embrace Britain's &#145;manifest destiny&#146; as an imperial power  (Cromer, &#145;The government of subject races&#146;, <span class="italic">Political and Literary Essays</span>, 4&#150;5; first published in January 1908). In what he called the &#145;government of subject races&#146;, Cromer believed that two requirements were paramount. The first was that imperial rule should be conducted according to the code of Christian morality, &#145;the one sure foundation on which the whole of our vast Imperial fabric can be built if it is to be durable&#146;  (ibid., 9). The second was to recognize that the &#145;self-interest of the subject race is the principal basis of the whole Imperial fabric&#146;  (ibid., 46), and that low taxation and careful attention to material conditions were the best means of countering demagogy. The success of this policy in Egypt, he claimed, had reduced Egyptian nationalism to a &#145;splutter&#146;  (Cromer, &#145;The French in Algeria&#146;, <span class="italic">Political and Literary Essays</span>, 253; first published in May 1913). It was the fusion of these two ideas which lent Cromer's imperialism its distinctive quality, for unlike Lord Salisbury or James Fitzjames Stephen, he resisted the grim conclusion that imperial authority must rest chiefly on force. If British rule avoided subservience to &#145;special interests&#146; at home, he argued:<blockquote>though we can never create a patriotism akin to that based on affinity of race or community of language, we may perhaps foster some sort of cosmopolitan allegiance grounded on the respect always accorded to superior talents and unselfish conduct and on the gratitude derived from favours conferred and those to come. (Cromer, &#145;The government of subject races&#146;, <span class="italic">Political and Literary Essays</span>, 13)</blockquote>Cromer's last public service was to assume in August 1916 the chairmanship of the wartime commission to inquire into the Dardanelles expedition. When announced in the House of Commons, his appointment was questioned by a number of members on the grounds of his failing health. Indeed he died before the report was published in February 1917, and the extent of his influence over its conclusions is hard to judge. Cromer died at his home, 36 Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 29 January 1917, and was buried at Bounemouth cemetery, Hampshire, beside his first wife. A memorial tablet, designed by Sir W. Goscombe John, was placed in Westminster Abbey.<br>
