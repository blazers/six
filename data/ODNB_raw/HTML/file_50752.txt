<span class="headword">Phillips <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barron]</span>,  Eliza</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Edward Phillips]</span>  (1822/3&#150;1916), <span class="occ">a founder of the (Royal) Society for the Protection of Birds (SPB)</span>, was the daughter of George Barron (1763?&#150;1852). Little is known about her early life apart from a story noted in her only obituary  (<span class="italic">Bird Notes and News</span>, 7, 1916, 33&#150;4) that Eliza Barron met Samuel Taylor Coleridge when she was a young girl living in Highgate. However, given this fact and what is known about her through her two marriages and her writings, it can be assumed she was well educated, of strong religious sensibilities, and reasonably well connected. According to her obituary she had &#145;a bent of mind perhaps somewhat masculine, and a deep sincerity of purpose&#146;  (ibid.). On 11 November 1847 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18208/', "Robert Montgomery Martin (1800x02&#150;1868)")</script>, the author, whose first marriage was dissolved by act of parliament to facilitate their union. It was after she was widowed in 1868 that her interest in animal welfare began, inspired by witnessing the sufferings of cattle on a sea journey. On 16 May 1874 she married the Revd Edward Phillips (1807&#150;1885), author of a number of books on ecclesiastical matters, with whom she lived at Culverdon Castle, Tunbridge Wells, where she became the central figure in the local branch of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). After the loss of her second husband in 1885 Mrs Phillips left Kent to live in Croydon and it was there that she made a central contribution to the history of the protection of bird life in Britain. The Society for the Protection of Birds (the prefix Royal was added by charter in 1904) came into being as a national organization in 1891. An amalgam of different groups and societies had been coalescing in the second half of the 1880s, such as the Plumage League and the Selbourne Society for the Protection of Birds, Plants, and Pleasant Places. The central focus of these groups was opposition to the use of bird feathers in ladies' fashions and the plumage trade. The founding of the SPB specifically brought together an anti-plumage group based in Didsbury, Manchester, run by Mrs Robert Williamson and the &#145;Fur, Fin and Feather&#146; afternoons that were held at Mrs Phillips's house in Croydon. These groups were mainly composed of women, although the natural history writer W. H. Hudson frequently attended Mrs Phillips's afternoon meetings. Mrs Phillips was the first vice-president of the SPB and was also the first to chair the governing committee during the first year after the society was publicly launched in 1893. It was during the early days of the society that Mrs Phillips's work was most influential. She took charge of publications and wrote the annual reports and the society's first leaflet entitled <span class="italic">Destruction of Ornamental-Plumaged Birds</span> (1890). The success of this work by both her and others can be measured by the fact that by 1897 the society had a full-time office in London and during that year distributed 50,000 leaflets and over 16,000 letters; by 1898 it had 20,000 members. Mrs Phillips wrote five pamphlets in all, including <span class="italic">Bird Food in Winter</span> (1897) which recommended the use of artificial berries for Christmas decorations instead of taking them from the wild. This would also have the added advantage that their manufacture would provide employment for poor women. Her strong religious sensibilities are reflected in her remarks as recorded in the minutes of the society's annual meetings and in a co-authored poem on caring for the animals and birds in God's creation, published in F. H. Suckling's <span class="italic">Humane Educator</span> (1891) entitled &#145;Take courage, all!&#146; Mrs. Phillips's last recorded contribution at the annual meeting of the SPB was in 1902, but she evidently kept up a long correspondence with W. H. Hudson, although only his letters have survived. To a large extent she typifies the articulate and strong-minded middle- and upper-class women who made such an important, and often forgotten, contribution to the animal and bird welfare groups of the later nineteenth century. Eliza Phillips died aged ninety-three at her home, Vaughan House, 22 Morland Road, Croydon, on 18 August 1916.<br>
