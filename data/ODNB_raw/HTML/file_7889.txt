<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Black Douglas]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1330), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7922/', "Sir William Douglas")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49418/', "Douglas family")</script>] and of Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander, the steward of Scotland; she had died by 1289. William Douglas's arrest (1297) and imprisonment and death (1298) allowed Edward I to grant his lands of Douglas to Sir Robert Clifford, leaving James to find his own way in the world.<h2>
<a name="Firstbattles"></a>First battles</h2>About 1301&#150;4 Douglas went to Paris (where he sowed his wild oats), possibly as valet to William Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews, because after the latter's return to Scotland Douglas served him as his carver. Lamberton interceded with Edward I, asking that Douglas have his lands restored to him, but merely angered the king. When Robert I made his bid for the throne in 1306, Douglas soon joined him. He is said to have been present at the battle of Methven on 19 June 1306 and to have shared Robert's subsequent hardships in the highlands, though it is unlikely that he went to Kintyre, Rathlin, and the Isles with the king between September and December 1306.<br>
<br>In 1307 Douglas began his long campaign to recover his heritage. He took Douglas Castle about 1 May 1307, but ingratiatingly sent the garrison back to Clifford (who repaired the castle); he was at Loudoun on 10 May, seeking to negotiate terms with the advancing force of Aymer de Valence, before joining King Robert in halting them. In the following months he harassed the English and, while he was hounded near Paisley in September 1307, defeated the pursuers at &#145;Edirford&#146; near Fenwick, Ayrshire. He remained in Ettrick Forest when Robert went north in September 1307 and on Palm Sunday (7 April) 1308 caught the garrison of Douglas Castle in Douglas kirk, took the undefended castle, and beheaded the prisoners in a cellar, mingling their blood and limbs with emptied sacks of provisions and tuns of wine from the castle stores; the well was polluted with salt and dead horse. The name Douglas Lardner needs no further explanation. Later in the year he joined the king to defeat the men of John of Argyll, whom they sandwiched between their forces on the slopes of Ben Cruachan, and after his return to Ettrick captured a small body of Anglo-Scots including the king's nephew, Thomas Randolph.<br>
<br>Between Douglas's appearance as a baron, though not a knight, at the St Andrews parliament of March 1309 and Bannockburn in 1314, little is heard of him, partly because the war was relatively quiet in 1309&#150;11, and partly because King Robert himself led the incursions into enemy territory thereafter. Douglas is not named at the attacks on Dundee, Berwick, or Perth in 1312&#150;13, but early in 1314, when Randolph, now earl of Moray, was besieging Edinburgh, he again had a signal success from his Ettrick base by taking Roxburgh Castle at night on 27 February 1314, his men creeping close to the walls under cloaks and securing a rope ladder to the wall-head. Later in the year he and his young cousin Walter Stewart were knighted on the eve of Bannockburn&#151;he must have been at least twenty-six years old&#151;and, according to Barbour's <span class="italic">Bruce</span>, he was in command of one of four Scottish divisions there. But all other sources are agreed on three divisions, and it is likely that he served under Edward Bruce. When the English broke and Edward II fled, King Robert allowed Douglas to pursue him, but the Scots dared not send a large enough cavalry force lest the English rally (or so Barbour claims); despite being followed by Douglas all the way, Edward and his men rode by Winchburgh to Dunbar and safety.<h2>
<a name="CampaignsinnorthernEngland"></a>Campaigns in northern England</h2>The victory of Bannockburn, though not complete, established Robert I's rule firmly, and led to an intensification of attacks on northern England, attacks in which the king rarely participated, the leaders being Moray, when not in Ireland, and Douglas. In the summer of 1315 when the Scots invaded co. Durham, the king sent Douglas to Hartlepool, formerly a Bruce possession; Douglas despoiled the town, took men and women prisoner, and rejoined the king to return home. Later in the year, in Cumberland, Douglas ravaged in Copeland, robbing the priory of St Bees of its vestments, before joining the king at the siege of Carlisle. In the final assault, on 30 July, his men seem to have reached the wall-head, but were driven off, and Douglas himself is said to have been wounded; the army withdrew. On 13 January 1316, in an unsuccessful surprise attack on Berwick, Douglas barely escaped with his life in a small boat; according to one source, he was jointly responsible for the taking of the town in April 1318, having bribed a defender to allow Scots to climb the wall:<blockquote>At dawn, with the gates opened, they had James Douglas, who was waiting outside, come in. This James entered the town with such lightness and joy in his heart that he claimed he had come into the city more cheerfully and happily than even paradise. For they despoiled all that they found and killed those who resisted them, throwing the rest into prison. (Stevenson, 5)</blockquote>Barbour gives the credit elsewhere.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in the first half of 1317 the king and Moray diverted their energies to Ireland and Douglas was left in Scotland, according to Barbour, as &#145;Warden&#146; and &#145;Warden of the March&#146;. The former, which implies a regency, is unlikely; the latter is independently attested. Seeking advantage from the king's absence, the English warden, the earl of Arundel, invaded Roxburghshire with a large force in March 1317, and aimed:<blockquote>at Lintalee, where James Douglas was staying in a certain fortified place with 200 men. Hearing of their coming, Douglas took to flight, leaving the place empty, which a noble freebooter called Elias the clerk, with 30 companions entered, eating up the many victuals he found there. But James, having ascertained the sloth of the English, who made little effort to approach the place, recovered his boldness, entered the place, cut off the head of Elias and stuck its face inhumanely in the anus, killing the rest by the sword. Then he violently attacked the army of the English, which conducted itself very carelessly, and killed Sir Thomas Richmond. (Stevenson, 3&#150;4)</blockquote>Barbour has another version, omitting Douglas's initial flight and the fate of Elias's face, but describing how Douglas knocked Richmond to the ground, dismounted, turned him over, and dispatched him with a dagger&#151;no time for taking prisoners in the heat of combat.<br>
<br>When the succession was regulated in 1315, it was laid down that in the event of a child succeeding Robert I, Moray was to be guardian; three years later, in revised provisions after the death of Edward Bruce, Moray was again to serve or, if he had died, Douglas. Although he was not an earl nor any kin of the king and the extent of his comradeship with Robert may well have been overdrawn by Barbour, Douglas's military capacities had nevertheless won him recognition as the outstanding man in the kingdom, and a series of brushes with the enemy in these years confirmed his abilities as a brilliant tactician and ruthless field commander, to whom winning was all. The women of the English borders silenced their children with the threat that mewling would bring the Black Douglas upon them. The name is not derived from his coat of arms, so presumably refers to the colour of his hair.<br>
<br>Douglas with Moray led the force which penetrated to near York in 1319, defeated a local force mustered by the archbishop at the &#145;Chapter of Myton&#146; (because so many clerics were killed), and pulled Edward II away from the siege of Berwick. There was a truce in 1320&#150;21, and in 1322 Douglas was deep in the negotiations between an invalid King Robert and the traitor Thomas, earl of Lancaster. Later in that year, as Edward II withdrew from his vain march to Edinburgh, Douglas caught and destroyed a scouting party at Melrose, then joined his king and Moray in a swift and secret invasion of England which sent the queen fleeing for refuge from York, defeated Edward's force in a brilliant uphill assault near Byland, and almost caught him as he fled from Rievaulx Abbey, abandoning his plate and equipment to the Scots; again Barbour presents Douglas as commander, but it is likely that he served under Moray and the king.<h2>
<a name="Victoryanditsrewards"></a>Victory and its rewards</h2>After the truce of 1323&#150;7 Douglas was a leader either with or, more probably, under Moray of the 1327 campaign in Northumberland which drew Edward III in pursuit. It is brilliantly described by Jean le Bel (who was with Edward) and by Barbour, and if the latter prettifies the planning of the Scots, there can be no doubt that the English stumbled about in a strategic and tactical fog. Barbour ascribes two brilliant moves to Douglas: in Weardale he led a night force round the English and attacked their camp on the far side, cutting tent-ropes to confuse and immobilize them and almost reaching King Edward's tent; and on 6&#150;7 August 1327, silently by night, the Scots evacuated Stanhope Park with no loss other than of horses and equipment&#151;in large amounts, says le Bel. The former enterprise was certainly his.<br>
<br>The English made peace in 1328, and Douglas and Moray were at Berwick for the rumbustious marriage of the young David, earl of Carrick, to Joan of the Tower; the kirkyard wall was knocked down by the revellers. Douglas had been well rewarded by his king with grants of the lands, castle, and forest of Jedworth, of Ettrick Forest, Lauderdale, and Bedrule in the east and the baronies of Staplegordon and Westerkirk in Eskdale in the west, as well as a more generous definition of his lordship of Douglas in Lanarkshire. After the peace the family's English lands (at Fawdon in Northumberland) were restored to him, despite the king's wish not to revive such double loyalties. At Byland he had taken three French knights prisoner; in return for 4400 merks he was persuaded to release these men to his king, who wished to send them home to win over Charles IV of France. As payment of this sum the king, by putting an emerald ring on Douglas's finger, gave him the revenues of criminal justice from all his lands and baronies and freed them from any services due; it was a unique mark of favour, and at the same time a taste of the gravy which dripped from the roast of chivalric warfare.<h2>
<a name="DeathinSpain"></a>Death in Spain</h2>In 1329, as Robert I lay dying, Douglas undertook for his lord, troubled by the murder of Comyn in a church in 1306, the responsibility of carrying the king's heart to the Holy Land &#145;to the help of Christians against Saracens&#146;  (<span class="italic">CDS</span>, vol. 3, nos. 990, 991) and returning it for burial at Melrose Abbey. On 1 February 1330, the day of Douglas's patron, St Brigit, he made a gift to Newbattle Abbey, then set out for the Mediterranean by sea with an English safe conduct. In Spain he joined Alfonso XI of Castile in his war against the Moors of Granada, and was involved in a battle at Turon near the siege of Teba, Malaga province. He seems to have been rash, as he became isolated and was cut down and killed on 25 August 1330. His body was boiled, the flesh buried in Spain and the bones brought back for burial at Douglas, where decades later his illegitimate son, Archibald, provided the tombstone in that kirk. The political consequences of sending Douglas away were catastrophic, for Moray died as guardian a week before the war was renewed in 1332, leaving the Scots without the one leader who might have discouraged Edward III.<br>
<br>Barbour's <span class="italic">Bruce</span> describes Douglas memorably:<blockquote>his face was somewhat grey and he had black hair, as I heard say; but his limbs were well made, with big bones and broad shoulders. His body was well-made and lean, as those who saw him said to me. When he was cheerful he was attractive, meek and sweet in company, but if you saw him in battle, he had another face altogether. He lisped in his speech a little, but that suited him very well. (Barbour, 64)</blockquote>When he was in Spain, an English knight was astonished that so fierce and famous a veteran had no scars on his face. He has left only one known charter as grantor, and most of our knowledge of him comes from <span class="italic">The Bruce</span>, behind which surely lies a life, perhaps by Douglas herald, written not long after his death; such a source is suggested by Barbour's knightly league-table entry: &#145;he was beaten thirteen times, and won victory fifty-seven&#146;  (Barbour, 312).<br>
<br>The name of Douglas's wife is unknown, but they had a son, William, who was killed, childless, at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. James also had an illegitimate son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7861/', "Archibald Douglas")</script>, who, through an entail of 1342, succeeded to the lands and (by then) earldom of Douglas in 1388, and from whom the earls down to 1455 were descended.<br>
