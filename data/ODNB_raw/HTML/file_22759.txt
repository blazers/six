<span class="headword">Price,  Laurence</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1628&#150;1675), <span class="occ">ballad and chapbook writer</span>, is a shadowy figure despite his prolific output. Only three contemporary references to him are known, all from the 1650s and all derogatory. One patronizes his astrological pamphlets, the other two belittle his ballads and verse. In default of information on his origins and life, his bibliography is his biography. However, connections with Bristol have been suggested; and one commentator roundly states that Price was a native of London, adding that &#145;during the civil war he seems to have occasionally been a hanger-on of the parliamentary army&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Internal evidence from successive publications indicates that Price supported Charles I (<span class="italic">Great Britaines Time of Triumph</span>, 1641), then at least sympathized with the Commonwealth (<span class="italic">The Quakers Feare</span>, <span class="italic">The Matchles Sheapard</span>, both 1656) before in due course welcoming the Restoration (<span class="italic">Win at First, Lose at Last</span>, 1660?).<br>
<br>Unlike his royalist ballad-writing rival, Martin Parker, Price did not have a strong ideological commitment; rather he sought to write what would sell in order to make a living. (One of his ballads, &#145;Oh, Gramercy Penny&#146;, <i>c</i>.1628, deals at length with the predicament of those without money.) He therefore trimmed politically while exploring the traditional staples of the cheap literature trade. His thirty-three &#145;small books&#146;&#151;in effect, pamphlets of usually eight or twelve pages, roughly 3 inches by 6, illustrated by (sometimes relevant) woodcuts&#151;cover such topics as crime (<span class="italic">Bloody Actions Performed</span>, 1653), social comment (<span class="italic">Fortune's Lottery</span>, 1657), sensational news (<span class="italic">The Shepherd's Prognostication Foretelling the Sad and Strange Eclipse of the Sun</span>, 1652), and fictional tales (<span class="italic">The Famous History of Valentine and Orson</span>, 1673, Price's version of a tale which originated in fifteenth-century France). Some publications of this kind were miscellanies; for example, he described <span class="italic">Make Roome for Christmas</span> (1657) as &#145;A delightful New Book, full of merry Jests, rare Inventions, pretty Conceits, Christmas Carols, pleasant Tales, and witty Verses&#146;  (title-page).<br>
<br>Price's broadside ballads, of which sixty-two have been identified (though others may be lost), cover much the same ground as his small books, though with greater emphasis on relations between the sexes, as in &#145;Two Fervent Lovers&#146; (1632), &#145;Loves Feirce Desire&#146; (1656), and &#145;Flora's Farewel&#146; (1675). One may not accept C. H. Firth's judgement that, together with Parker, Price &#145;perfected&#146; the ballad as a literary form  (Firth, 28), but Price's success is clearly demonstrated by the frequent reprintings of his ballads and books not only during his lifetime but in some cases well into the nineteenth century, in both London and the provinces. As was normal with broadsides, his work frequently appeared without acknowledgement; unfortunately, this was also the case in compilations by Thomas Percy, Walter Scott, and F. J. Child. Despite his professed dislike of broadsides Child paid Price a singular compliment by admitting three of his ballads to a collection intended to include only traditional material, <span class="italic">The English and Scottish Popular Ballads</span> (5 vols., 1882&#150;98). Of one of these, &#145;Robin Hood's Golden Prize&#146; (1656), Child remarked that his copy &#145;seems to be signed L. P., probably the initials of the versifier&#146;  (Child, no. 147, headnote). The other two, &#145;The Famous Flower of Serving Men&#146; (1656) and &#145;A Warning for Married Women&#146; (1657), were not acknowledged. Nevertheless, they remained in popular favour, with versions continuing in oral tradition long into the twentieth century, in both Britain and North America. Price's &#145;Rocke the Cradle&#146; (1631) enjoyed a similar vogue.<br>
<br>There is no complete and definitive list of Price's publications and their whereabouts; seventeenth-century editions are scattered through a variety of collections such as Douce, Rawlinson, and Wood (Bodl. Oxf.), Euing (Glasgow University), Pepys (Magdalene College, Cambridge), Bagford, Huth, Roxburghe, and Thomason (BL). Selections, sometimes restricted by considerations of perceived indecency, were published in learned volumes by Victorian ballad scholars. A few items resurfaced in anthologies of the late twentieth century. An edition of Price's collected works is long overdue because of their intrinsic qualities, documentary value, and significance in the history of popular culture.<br>
