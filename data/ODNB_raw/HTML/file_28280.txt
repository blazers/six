<span class="headword">Vigf&uacute;sson,  Gu&eth;brandur</span>  (1827&#150;1889), <span class="occ">scholar of Icelandic literature</span>, was born on 13 March 1827 in Galtardalur, Dalas&yacute;sla, western Iceland. He was the son of Vigf&uacute;s G&iacute;slason, of an old and respected Icelandic family, and Halld&oacute;ra G&iacute;slad&oacute;ttir. He was brought up by his foster-mother and great-aunt Krist&iacute;n Vigf&uacute;sd&oacute;ttir, to whom, as he thankfully recorded in his last days, he owed not only that he became a man of letters, but almost everything. He received his early education in the house of his cousin, a clergyman, who prepared him for the Latin high school of Bessasta&eth;ir; he studied there, moving with the school to Reykjav&iacute;k. In 1849 he left the school, and Iceland, for Copenhagen University, which he entered in 1850, holding a bursary at Regentsen College. He was appointed stipendiarius under the Arnamagn&aelig;an trustees, and worked in the Arnamagn&aelig;an Library, under the patronage of J&oacute;n Sigur&eth;sson, leader of the Icelandic independence movement. It was this work that made him familiar with every vellum and paper copy of the classic and popular Icelandic and Old Scandinavian literature, and gave him the material for his future research. For fourteen years he led a life of research interrupted by two visits to Iceland (the second in 1858) and tours in Germany (during which he called on Jakob Grimm) and Norway. His superb travelogue recounting the last tour was published in 1855 by J&oacute;n Sigur&eth;sson in the Icelandic journal he edited.<br>
<br>Vigf&uacute;sson's first printed piece of scholarship was <span class="italic">T&iacute;matal</span> (written between October 1854 and April 1855), a complete chronology of the whole body of classic Icelandic literature, which has not been entirely superseded by subsequent scholarship. His work on editing the sagas began with <span class="italic">Biskupa s&ouml;gur</span> in 1858. In 1860 followed <span class="italic">B&aacute;r&eth;ar saga</span> and <span class="italic">Forns&ouml;gur</span> (in partnership with Theodur M&ouml;bius), and in 1864 <span class="italic">Eyrbyggja saga</span>. In 1868 he finished eight years' work in co-operation with Carl Richard Unger, and published the last volume of his edition of <span class="italic">Flateyjarb&oacute;k</span>. The prefaces to these editions opened a new era of Icelandic scholarship, in which historical method and the results of modern philology were applied with a view to elucidating the whole history of classic Scandinavian literature. During these years Vigf&uacute;sson's chief friends were H. Larpent (the translator of <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>), K. Dahlenborg, Konrad Maurer, M&ouml;bius, Unger, and J&oacute;n &Aacute;rnason. For &Aacute;rnason he sought out folk-tales in Iceland, and he wrote a preface for &Aacute;rnason's collection, which is still of significance in Icelandic folklore. In 1858 Vigf&uacute;sson became engaged to the daughter of an important local government official in Dalas&yacute;sla, an engagement which foundered on the long wait for him to take his final examination. Eventually El&iacute;nborg Kristj&aacute;nsd&oacute;ttir married another. Vigf&uacute;sson never married.<br>
<br>In 1864 Vigf&uacute;sson was approached by Sir George Webbe Dasent, who had been entrusted by the representatives of Richard Cleasby with the task of completing and printing an Icelandic&#150;English dictionary, on which that scholar had been engaged until his death. Konr&aacute;&eth; G&iacute;slason had been supposedly engaged on the work for nearly twenty years, but the heirs, foreseeing no speedy conclusion, asked Dasent to find someone else. Dasent persuaded Vigf&uacute;sson to come to London and take up the work. The Oxford University Press, largely at the instigation of the dean of Christ Church, H. G. Liddell, agreed to publish the book, and, after some months in London, Vigf&uacute;sson moved to Oxford in 1866, where he resided until his death. Without transcribers or assistants, with the help of his own collections of Fritzner's <span class="italic">Icelandic&#150;Danish Dictionary</span>, then appearing in fascicles, and a miserably inadequate mass of materials supplied by Cleasby's Copenhagen employees, Vigf&uacute;sson finished the <span class="italic">Oxford Icelandic&#150;English Dictionary</span> in 1873. During its progress he had the advantage of being able to consult Liddell, whose practical knowledge of lexicography was unrivalled. Liddell obtained for him an honorary MA (1871) and common-room rights at Christ Church. The dictionary was generally well received, though Dasent's insistence on retaining Cleasby's name in the most prominent position on the title-page caused his estrangement from Vigf&uacute;sson.<br>
<br>Vigf&uacute;sson made many firm English friends, though his laborious life left him little time. And, despite his &#145;weird but imposing personality&#146;, he built up a devoted group of students, including W. P. Ker, John Sephton, Charles Plummer, W. A. Craigie, and Joseph Wright. It was during this period that Vigf&uacute;sson became embroiled in a major feud with Britain's other prominent Icelandic scholar, Eir&iacute;kur Magn&uacute;sson, over a new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Icelandic.<br>
<br>In 1874&#150;5 Vigf&uacute;sson went to Copenhagen and to Stockholm to make transcripts for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> editions of <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> and <span class="italic">H&aacute;konar saga</span>, and discovered a fuller text of part of the former than had before been known to exist. These appeared with prefaces in 1887. The next three years, 1875&#150;8, were occupied with <span class="italic">Sturlunga saga</span> (1878), to which was affixed a complete literary history of old northern literature, with a full account of the extant manuscript material. Unfortunately <span class="italic">Sturlunga saga</span> &#145;fell foul of factors as banal as excessive cost price, hopeless advertising and total absence of reviews&#146;  (Wawn, 836). Scarcely a copy reached Iceland, while the prohibitive cost limited purchasers in Scandinavia.<br>
<br>In 1879 Vigf&uacute;sson brought out an <span class="italic">Icelandic Prose Reader</span>. In 1883 the <span class="italic">Corpus poeticum boreale</span> appeared; although, after the dictionary, this represents Vigf&uacute;sson's most lasting memorial, the <span class="italic">Corpus</span>&#151;&#145;so vast, so full of delights, so unbelievably unreliable&#146;  (Dronke, 93)&#151;was innocent of new philological methodology, and today remains a quarry for ideas rather than a model for a text. The <span class="italic">Grimm Centenary Papers</span> (1886), containing many of Vigf&uacute;sson's most original thoughts on Norse history and Germanic literature, may be considered as an appendix to the <span class="italic">Corpus</span>. He also wrote several papers in the Oxford Philological Society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, in the Philological Society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, on philological and historical subjects.<br>
<br>From 1866 to 1889 Vigf&uacute;sson was occupied with his edition of the <span class="italic">Landn&aacute;ma-b&oacute;c</span>, and with the duties of his readership, for he had been appointed reader in Icelandic in the University of Oxford in 1884, a position created for him at the instigation of Liddell and York Powell. He was centenary doctor of Uppsala in 1877, and he received the order of the Dannebrog in 1885. He had a long stay in Copenhagen, working at the Arnamagn&aelig;an Icelandic manuscripts. In 1886 he went to the Isle of Man, and published in the <span class="italic">Manx Note Book</span> his readings of the runic monuments there. In the autumn of 1888 he fell victim to cancer, and he died on 31 January 1889 at the Sarah Acland Home, Wellington Square, Oxford; he was buried on 3 February at St Sepulchre's cemetery in a ceremony attended by every notable philologist in Oxford. <span class="italic">Origines Islandicae</span>, on which he was working until his death, and which York Powell was supposed to complete, was published by the press after the latter's death with a hasty list of corrigenda by W. A. Craigie, but otherwise in a lamentably error-ridden condition.<br>
