<span class="headword">Paget, Lord  Clarence Edward</span>  (1811&#150;1895), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born on 17 June 1811, the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21112/', "Henry William Paget, first marquess of Anglesey (1768&#150;1854)")</script>, and his second wife, Charlotte Cadogan (1781&#150;1853), previously married to Henry Wellesley. His half-brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29006/', "Henry Wellesley, first Earl Cowley")</script>. After attending Westminster School Paget entered the navy on 29 May 1823. As a midshipman he served on board the <i>Asia</i> at the battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827. He passed his examination in 1830 and was promoted lieutenant on 14 May 1831; after a number of flagship appointments he was promoted commander on 25 September 1834, through the intervention of the prime minister, prompted by his father. In 1835 his father took him to Germany to cure venereal disease, and in 1836 he was seriously ill with abscesses on the liver. The former illness permanently damaged his eyesight.<br>
<br>In 1837 Paget commanded the sloop <i>Pearl</i> on the North American station; he paid her off after being promoted captain on 26 March 1839. That summer he accompanied his father to Russia, where he visited the tsar and observed naval and military manoeuvres. The following year he served as flag captain to Admiral Otway at Sheerness. He commanded the <i>Aigle</i> in the Mediterranean between 1841 and 1845. In 1846 he was appointed secretary to the Board of Ordnance by his father, then the master-general, and in 1847 was elected a Liberal MP for the government borough of Sandwich, which he held until 1852. On 7 April 1852 he married Martha Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1895), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20943/', "Admiral Sir Robert Waller Otway")</script>. They had one son and two daughters. In 1852 he left the Board of Ordnance on the retirement of his father. He was not considered to have been a success in this post, giving little indication of his real ability.<br>
<br>In February 1854 Sir James Graham appointed Paget to command the steam battleship <i>Princess Royal</i>. He served in the Baltic during 1854 and, with other aristocratic officers, was openly and unjustifiably critical of the admiral, Sir Charles Napier. Paget's letters to his brother-in-law Lord Sydney were used to discredit Napier in cabinet and at court. Paget had incurred Napier's wrath by poor station keeping and running his ship aground. He was transferred to the Black Sea for the 1855 campaign, during which he developed a system of lights to permit night attacks on Sevastopol from the sea. In July he had to be invalided home with a recurrence of severe eye problems and general ill health. On 4 February 1857 he became a rear-admiral. In March 1857 he regained the seat at Sandwich, this time supported by his business colleague Richard Green, a leading London shipbuilder and shipowner with local influence.<br>
<br>Paget used his seat in the Commons to attack the administration of the navy, and quickly secured an offer of a seat at the Board of Admiralty, which he turned down, as acceptance would have required him to end his links with Green. In this period Paget co-operated with the economic radicals, especially William Schaw Lindsay and Richard Cobden, speaking effectively against the conservative navy estimates of 1859. The combination of radical links, parliamentary talent, and aristocratic origins persuaded Lord Palmerston to appoint him first or political secretary to the Admiralty under Edward Adolphus Seymour, twelfth duke of Somerset, first lord of the Admiralty. He held this post from June 1859 until April 1866, acting as departmental spokesman in the House of Commons. Gradually the members realized that his apparently frank and honest statements were artfully constructed smokescreens. He was an early advocate of the ironclad warship, encouraging and advising Gladstone in his attempt to circumvent the declared policy of the government and the Admiralty that it was necessary to build further wooden warships until the ironclad was proven. His support for smaller ironclads led the controller of the navy, Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker, to leave office. Paget joined Gladstone's attempt to secure a naval arms limitation treaty with France, using Lindsay and Cobden as emissaries, once again in clear opposition to the stated policy of the Admiralty and Palmerston. Having accepted office he was never again trusted by the radicals, a fact that had some influence over his decision to take a seagoing command rather than face a new election.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1865 Paget reached the rank of vice-admiral and resigned from the Admiralty; he accepted the post of commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet on the 28th, took the Chiltern Hundreds on the 30th, and was sworn of the privy council. After a largely uneventful three-year term in the Mediterranean Paget returned home and actively canvassed for the post of first lord under his friend Gladstone, with the proviso that he was to be promoted to the peerage. In this he was unsuccessful. He reached the rank of admiral on 1 April 1870, but had no further employment and retired in 1876. In retirement he devoted his time to the arts, being an accomplished sculptor. He modelled and erected a colossal statue of Nelson on the coast of Anglesey, close to his home. He was made GCB in May 1886. Paget died at 65 Regency Square, Brighton, on 22 March 1895, and his wife died the next day. They were buried at Patcham, near Brighton, on 28 March.<br>
<br>After an early career made by his father's whig connections Paget matured into an ambitious political admiral. Keenly aware of his limited opportunities as a younger son, albeit his father's favourite, Paget exploited his profession for personal advancement. Although an unimpressive sea officer, and an unscrupulous politician, he was, as first secretary, the most effective naval officer in the House of Commons in the nineteenth century.<br>
