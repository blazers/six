<span class="headword">Lambe, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1566&#150;1646), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the first of four children of John Lambe of Northampton and Elizabeth Aylett. He matriculated in 1583 from St John's College, Cambridge, where a novel conformist divinity was developing, and graduated BA in 1587. He then made a pilgrimage to Rome, returning to proceed MA in 1590. His ruthlessly ambitious career began in the Peterborough diocesan courts in 1590, and from 1603 until 1628 he held the office of registrar. By 1607 he was married either to Anne Crompton (<i>d</i>. 1624) or to an unknown first wife; he and Anne had two daughters (born in 1619 and 1621), one of whom, Barbara, married Basil Feilding, later earl of Denbigh.<br>
<br>In Northampton Lambe joined an embattled faction of avant-garde conformists led by John Buckeridge, Richard Butler (a close university friend), and David Owen, whose outlook was characterized by political absolutism, rabid anti-puritanism, anti-sabbatarianism, and an insistence on full ceremonial conformity. Thus in 1604 Lambe wrote to another university friend, Richard Neile, describing the anti-papist panic in Northampton following the recent clerical deprivations for nonconformity as a puritan threat to social order. He lodged with Butler at Spratton from 1605. During 1606 there commenced legal disputes with Lewis Tresham over land at Rothwell and with Jerome Lowe, who had violently interfered with Lambe's collection of tithes from the leased rectory of Yardley Hastings. As a result of the latter, Lambe and his wife were lampooned as papist sympathizers in satirical poems circulating among his puritan enemies around Northampton. In retaliation Lambe in 1607 brought proceedings against his opponents in the Star Chamber by raising, in a letter to James I, the spectre of a popular puritan threat to monarchy in the wake of the midland revolt. After 1608 he moved back to Northampton and at some time before 1615 lived at Tower Close. From 1611 until 1617 Lambe was the surrogate of Christopher Wyvell, the chancellor of Lincoln diocese, and there became associated with John Williams, to whose patronage, according to Williams's biographer, John Hacket, Lambe, who allegedly possessed the mien of a prize-fighter, owed his rise to power.<br>
<br>Between 1615 and 1629 Lambe was chancellor of Peterborough diocese, and supported a clique of like-minded clergymen whom he appointed his surrogates in the church courts&#151;the most zealous being Robert Sibthorpe (his brother-in-law), David Owen, and Samuel Clarke. Lambe now tried to turn the Calvinist evangelical Jacobean church in a conformist direction. The county town bore the brunt of their campaign: ceremonial conformity, particularly lay reception of the communion kneeling, was enforced with a severity and a contempt for puritan equivocation almost unknown in the Jacobean church; the godly practices of holding prayer meetings and gadding to sermons were proscribed, and an abortive attempt was made to enforce the anti-sabbatarian <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> (1618) and the observance of various holy days. In 1616, when his puritan enemies in Northampton and Sir Edward Montague retaliated by bringing articles to Judge Sir Edward Coke's attention charging him with persecuting them in the church courts, Williams persuaded Cambridge University to award Lambe an LLD. This made him eligible for the commissaryship of the archdeaconry of Leicester to which Neile, now bishop of Lincoln, appointed him in 1617. From 1619 until 1640 Lambe served as a JP for Northamptonshire: in 1620 he moved to Rothwell. When his Northampton opponents sought redress for a second time from the 1621 parliament, Williams, now lord keeper, again saved him&#151;Lambe's letter to James I describing a puritan conspiracy to undermine royal authority&#151;by securing a knighthood which was conferred on 26 July 1621 at Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire. The king appointed him the same year to the court of delegates. When Archbishop Abbot accidentally killed a gamekeeper Williams recommended that the duke of Buckingham seek legal advice from Lambe on how to proceed. After 1624 Lambe married Elizabeth Kimbould; there were no children of this union, and she predeceased him. A quarrel arose in 1626 over the registrarship of the archdeaconry of Leicester, Lambe backing his subordinate, Henry Allein, against John Pregion. In an emergent split from Williams, Lambe's party accused the now bishop of Lincoln of stymieing a high commission investigation into Leicester puritanism. Allein (backed by Lambe and Sibthorpe) in 1627 charged Pregion with leniency towards, and sympathy with, puritans. Williams rejected the case, and when Allein appealed to the privy council in 1628 Lambe and Sibthorpe gave evidence against Williams. But unlike his erstwhile patron, Lambe was secure in royal favour: appointed a high commissioner in 1629 he obtained through Neile a royal pardon for Sibthorpe's defence of the royal prerogative (<span class="italic">Apostolike Obedience</span>), which the parliament of that year condemned. Examined by parliament, Lambe was saved by the dissolution. Williams's attempts to oust Lambe from his own Leicester office and replace him with his secretary, Walter Walker, led to a verdict for Walker in the court of king's bench, whose judge, Sir James Whitelocke, claimed Lambe had given &#145;the greatest affront to the Court that ever was&#146;  (Slatter, 55), but Lambe in 1632 persuaded Charles I to issue a royal command halting proceedings at common law. The matter had become part of the continuing Laud / Williams rivalry which climaxed in the latter's suspension from office.<br>
<br>Promoted to dean of the court of arches by his ally Archbishop William Laud in 1633, Lambe enforced as zealously as anyone the conformist policies he had so long preferred. In 1634 he advocated Laud's right to visit the diocese of Lincoln when Williams proved obstructive, and provided legal advice to Sir Thomas Wentworth on the Irish church. Lambe blocked the appeals of provincial parishes against Laudian policies, as in the cases of the churchwardens of All Saints (Northampton) and Upton, who were punished by Sibthorpe and Clarke for opposition to the altar policy: puritan scruples were condemned as seditious. As a high commissioner Lambe participated in the highest profile prosecutions of the personal rule, including those of Henry Burton, John Bastwick, William Prynne, Peter Smart, John Lilburne, and Sir Robert Howard. According to Laud at his trial, Lambe disobeyed the archbishop's order in 1638 to suppress John Cowell's absolutist work <span class="italic">The Interpreter</span>. He reinforced the actions of his Peterborough subordinates by prosecuting Miles Burkit for opposing the altar policy and Sir Richard Samwell for aiding him. The puritan prayer meetings of several Northamptonshire JPs were also targeted. By 1635, as commissary for the archdeaconry of Buckingham, he punished leaders of opposition to the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, while in Leicester archdeaconry he enforced the strictest Laudian altar policy. Lambe was a leading promoter of Laud's metropolitical visitation in Lincoln and Peterborough dioceses, accompanied the archbishop on his visitation of St Paul's Cathedral, successfully upheld the archbishop's right to visit Oxford University, and personally acted as visitor of Merton College. As one of the visitors of Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire archdeaconry, Lambe ordered the raising of an annual levy to support a church organ and organist. He intervened repeatedly in Sibthorpe's many local disputes and shared the view that opposition to the prerogative tax of ship money was the result of puritan sedition. Lambe also brought Sibthorpe's defence of George Plowright against impressment for the bishops' war to the attention of the privy council, where the verdict went against Sibthorpe.<br>
<br>At the zenith of his fortunes Lambe was chancellor to Queen Henrietta Maria from 26 January 1640 until 1642, and played a leading role in convocation's framing of new ecclesiastical canons. In August 1640 he detected a group of London clergy meeting to oppose the &#145;etcetera oath&#146; and proceeded in arches against clergy meeting at Kettering, who refused to swear the oath as illegal and sympathized with Scottish propaganda in the bishops' war. Lambe shared Sibthorpe's view that the conflict was the culmination of a puritan plot to subvert church and state. A flurry of petitions of grievance led in 1641 to his being sent for as a delinquent by the Long Parliament, which declared illegal many of the verdicts in which he had participated, fined him heavily, and sequestrated his property. Parliament even considered impeaching him; scurrilous pamphlet literature and cartoons linked him closely with the archbishop. By 1642 church court activity had ceased. Lambe was named in the commission of array for Northamptonshire, and after the outbreak of civil war he fled to royalist headquarters at Oxford in 1643, was incorporated as a member of the university on 9 December, and remained until the surrender in 1646. On his return to London to compound for his estates he died intestate (leaving a fortune reputedly valued at &pound;5000), probably at The Bell inn, Carter Lane, and was buried at the church of St Andrew by the Wardrobe, London, on 21 November 1646.<br>
