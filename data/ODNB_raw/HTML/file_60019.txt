<span class="headword">Bruce,  Christian</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1356), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was one of the many daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3753/', "Robert (VI) de Brus, earl of Carrick (1243&#150;1304)")</script>, and his wife, Marjorie; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3754/', "Robert I")</script> was her brother. She is supposed to have married Gartnait, earl of Mar, in the 1290s, but a number of objections have been raised against this. In the first place, she is never described as countess of Mar, nor even just &#145;of Mar&#146;. Second, there is no evidence of any communication between her and Donald, earl of Mar, who should have been her son, when both were imprisoned in England after 1306. Abbot Walter Bower (<i>d</i>. 1449) explicitly states that Gartnait married the eldest Bruce daughter, a description never applied to Christian, and made unlikely by the date of her death. Her later holding of Kildrummy Castle, the centre of the earldom of Mar, could point to a connection, but if there was one its nature remains incapable of definition.<br>
<br>Before 1305 Christian undoubtedly married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25118/', "Sir Christopher Seton (c.1278&#150;1306)")</script>, a knight with lands in Annandale and northern England. He was captured at Loch Doon Castle and executed by Edward I in 1306; she kept sacred his sacrifice in her brother's cause as late as 1324, when she founded a chapel in Dumfries to his memory. In 1306 she herself was captured by Edward, along with her sister Mary, her niece Marjorie, Bruce's queen, Elizabeth, and the countess of Buchan, at Tain in Ross-shire, possibly <i>en route</i> for Norway, where another sister, Isabel, was queen. Christian's punishment was captivity in the Gilbertine nunnery of Sixhills in Lincolnshire; her freedom was secured only in 1314 with the exchange of prisoners following the battle of Bannockburn. At some point after her release she was granted the lands of the Garioch, Aberdeenshire, which had come to the Bruces as part of their inheritance from David, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1219).<br>
<br>Although it is possible that she was the sister of King Robert whom English sources rumoured was intended for the hand of Andrew Harclay, earl of Carlisle, when he made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a peace treaty with Scotland early in 1323, Christian did not remarry until 1326. Perhaps the memory of the fate of her first husband was sufficient to deter her from a speedy second marriage, or perhaps her brother, now king, was keen to prevent the arrival of another nephew to complicate the succession so long as he himself remained without an heir. Her second husband was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19590/', "Sir Andrew Murray (1298&#150;1338)")</script>, son of the joint victor of the battle of Stirling Bridge, a man most certainly many years her junior. Being a member of the royal family, Christian took part in the coronation of her nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3726/', "David II")</script> in 1331 and shared a room in the palace at Scone with her nieces, the new king's sisters. When war broke out again shortly afterwards, Murray played a prominent role, as guardian of Scotland, in repulsing the attempts at conquest of Edward Balliol and Edward III of England. To this end he entrusted Christian with the keeping of Kildrummy Castle, and in 1335 she defended it against the earl of Atholl, Balliol's commander in the north. One of two vital defences of castles by women in this period (the other was that of Dunbar by Agnes Dunbar in 1338), her resistance enabled her husband to confront Atholl at Culblean and defeat him. Christian remained in custody of Kildrummy even after the death of Murray in 1338, entertaining her nephew's wife, Queen Joan, there in 1342. King David permitted her to draw an income from a number of sources, including the customs of Aberdeen. The final reference to her in the exchequer rolls suggests that she died, surely at least in her seventies, in 1356.<br>
