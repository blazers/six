<span class="headword">Johns,  John</span>  (1801&#150;1847), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and missionary</span>, was born on 17 March 1801 at Northills, Plymouth, the youngest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14862/', "Ambrose Bowden Johns (1776&#150;1858)")</script>, landscape painter, an artist who painted in the style of Turner, and his wife, Rebekah. Johns attended Plymouth grammar school and Edinburgh University, presumably because of its Presbyterian connection. In 1826 he was appointed minister to the congregation of English Presbyterians of Crediton, Devon, at a salary of &pound;30 p.a. Though he dreamed of becoming a poet in the lakeland tradition he nevertheless devoted himself to the active promotion of schemes for popular improvement. He married Caroline Reynell (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of Henry Reynell of Newton Abbot, on 6 September 1833. They subsequently had eight children, of whom six survived.<br>
<br>In 1836 Johns was appointed minister to the poor at the Domestic Mission in Liverpool. There he lived in Nile Street (now demolished, but then newly built accommodation for the rising middle class) adjacent to St James's Mount, where the Anglican cathedral now stands. Liverpool was at that time a boom city, the decline of the slave trade having been offset by the rapid development of American and colonial commerce. The demand for labour attracted an influx of poor migrants from neighbouring countries, particularly Ireland, who crowded into slums notorious for lacking any civilized amenity. Poverty of both mind and body on such a scale constituted an enormous problem. Inspired by Tuckerman and Channing, the celebrated American ministers who had pioneered the campaign for a mission to the poor, the Unitarians in Liverpool (as the local Presbyterians were by then denominated) set up the Domestic Mission Society in 1836. If the poor refused to come to the gospel, the gospel must be brought to the poor. This would be no task for the charitable amateur; a man of exceptional commitment and skill would be required.<br>
<br>The appointment of Johns was a surprising but perceptive choice. He was variously described as a dreamer of dreams, as if he had no skin, and as a practical mystic. He came with no other purpose than to demonstrate the validity of his own conviction that all men were equal and that none was beyond redemption, points of view then the subject of dissension in both religious and political circles. Confronted by people living lives that struck him as barely human, he undertook conventional missionary work, offering such spiritual and material comfort as was at his command. He made a modest contribution to civic affairs, for which he was respected. The poor regarded him with affection.<br>
<br>Johns achieved no spectacular results. Nevertheless he emerges as a figure of considerable significance. A frustrated poet and an indifferent preacher, he found an alternative outlet in his annual reports to his committee. His skill in the use of words and the sensibility of his powers of observation endow these detailed records with a rare quality of compassion. Issued every year throughout his period of service, the reports constitute a unique running commentary on one man's exploration of the relationship between an urban community and its members, at a point in time when this was undergoing major stress. Johns also published a number of sermons, tracts, and poems.<br>
<br>Johns's testimony inspired the ongoing programme of environmental reforms on which the nonconformist community focused throughout the following years and on which the tradition of &#145;Liverpool firsts&#146; is founded (that is, pioneering social policies such as first medical officer of health, and first slum clearance legislation). This was his legacy to those who had sponsored his mission.<br>
<br>The aftermath of the potato famine in Ireland brought about conditions in Liverpool such as even Johns had never seen before. His faith sorely tried, he toiled on until struck down by typhus while tending the body of a victim whom nobody else&#151;other than a Catholic priest&#151;would touch. He died on 23 June 1847 at 147 Mill Street, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, and was buried at St James's cemetery, Liverpool, two days later. He was survived by his wife, who died on 7 March 1861 in Hobart, Tasmania.<br>
