<span class="headword">Clark, Sir  George Smith</span>, first baronet  (1861&#150;1935), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and politician</span>, was born on 8 November 1861 in Paisley, the second of three children of James Clark (1830&#150;1910), thread manufacturer, and his first wife, Jane, daughter of George Smith, a Glasgow shipowner. His parents were both Scottish. Raised as a Presbyterian, George Clark was educated at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh. He then trained in the Belfast shipyard of Harland and Wolff, where he met Frank Workman, who had established a small shipyard on the Lagan in 1877. In 1880 they entered into a partnership. The incentives for Workman were the infusion of new capital and the establishment of an advantageous connection with a prominent shipowning family. This relationship yielded benefits quickly: Clark's uncle, George Smith, furnished many of the initial orders, especially for the larger ships.<br>
<br>An important step in the firm's growth was taken in 1891, when the partnership became Workman, Clark &amp; Co. Ltd. At this time Charles Allan, a relative of Clark, joined the company. Allan belonged to the Scottish family who owned the Allan Line. His arrival not only created further links with shipowners, but also led, under his directorship, to the establishment of an engineering department to produce engines which previously had been imported. From this point Workman Clark progressed rapidly. By 1902 its yards covered 50 acres. It launched more tonnage that year than any other shipbuilder in the world, a performance repeated in 1909. It pioneered two areas: the development of the turbine engine and the construction of insulated and refrigerated fruit carriers. The firm specialized in medium-sized cargo boats or passenger&#150;cargo combined, establishing useful connections with many of the leading lines in this area, including Alfred Holt &amp; Co. and Ellerman Lines.<br>
<br>During the First World War the firm concentrated on Admiralty work and in 1917 Clark received a baronetcy for his services. By 1920 the company's workforce had risen to 10,000. Clark contributed significantly to this progress as, until its takeover in 1920 by the Northumberland Shipping Company, the firm remained a private limited company and control lay largely with the Workman and Clark families. It is true that the business was operating in an environment of expanding world trade and, consequently, a growing demand for new tonnage, but Workman Clark fared better than most of its competitors, steadily increasing its share of the world market. Considering the briefer timespan of its operations, the company's success bore comparison with that of Harland and Wolff, and in early 1920 it seemed set to achieve greater expansion. By 1927, though, it was practically bankrupt. Its problems stemmed partly from the emergence in the 1920s of the overcapacity which affected all shipbuilding firms, but it was also the result of a financial operation in February 1920 involving Workman Clark's takeover by the Northumberland Shipping Company. A debenture loan for &pound;3 million was floated, professedly to advance the enterprises of Workman Clark in Belfast. Instead the proceeds were used partly to compensate the former shareholders of Workman Clark, and partly to purchase the shares of other companies which the Northumberland Shipping Company had acquired. Clark initially opposed this move and, together with his son, resigned, though the latter rejoined the board between 1924 and 1927. As a result the firm was saddled with huge debts without receiving the injection of capital that the debenture loan had promised. In 1927 the directors, including Clark, who had all been made very rich by the financial manoeuvres which had taken place seven years earlier, were sued on the grounds that the prospectus they had issued in 1920 was fraudulent. The case progressed to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. Effectively the company lost and went into temporary liquidation. It briefly revived as Workman Clark (1928) Ltd, but it could not survive the 1929 world depression, closing in 1935.<br>
<br>Clark's business interests were not confined to shipbuilding. In 1881, through his marriage to Frances Elisabeth Matier (<i>d</i>. 1929), he became a director of Henry Matier &amp; Co., linen manufacturers. He and his wife had two sons. A director of the Bank of Ireland and several shipping companies, he was an active Belfast harbour commissioner.<br>
<br>Clark was also involved politically. Like many Ulster businessmen he was drawn into politics by the home rule question. In 1907 he became MP for North Belfast, retiring in 1910 to devote more attention to his business affairs. He remained, though, a committed unionist. In 1913 he chaired the committee established in Ulster to smuggle guns, using his shipyard as a cover. With Workman and Allan, he helped to finance the Ulster Volunteer Force. Although the war put the &#145;national question&#146; on hold, it re-emerged with increased violence in 1919. Murders of members of the security forces by the IRA were followed by reprisals, and in 1920 the employees of Workman Clark were prominent in the expulsion of Catholics from the shipyards and other major factories in the city. In 1925 Clark became a unionist senator in the Northern Ireland parliament. He retained this position until his death at his home, Dunlambert, Fortwilliam Park, Belfast, on 23 March 1935. He was buried on 26 March in Belfast city cemetery.<br>
