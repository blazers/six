<span class="headword">Herbert,  Philip</span>, first earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke  (1584&#150;1650), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born on 10 October 1584 at Wilton House, Wiltshire, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13028/', "Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke (d. 1601)")</script>, and his third wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13040/', "Mary Herbert, n&#233;e Sidney (1561&#150;1621)")</script>, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13058/', "William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke (1580&#150;1630)")</script>. He was named Philip after his mother's brother, Sir Philip Sidney. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 9 March 1593, but only stayed at the university for three or four months. He first visited court in April 1600; on 27 December 1604 he married Lady Susan De Vere (1587&#150;1629), daughter of Edward De Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford. James I played a prominent part in the elaborate ceremony, and gave the bride &pound;500 in land and the bridegroom lands to the value of &pound;1000 a year.<h2>
<a name="Courtfavourite16031630"></a>Court favourite, 1603&#150;1630</h2>Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, later wrote that the young Philip Herbert:<blockquote>had the good fortune, by the comeliness of his person, his skill, and indefatigable industry in hunting, to be the first who drew the King's eyes towards him with affection &hellip; He pretended to no other qualifications than to understand horses and dogs very well, which his master loved him the better for. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.74)</blockquote>As John Aubrey later wrote, &#145;His Lordship's chiefe delight was in hunting and hawking, both of which he had to the greatest perfection of any peer in the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 304). Honours followed in quick succession: gentleman of the privy chamber (May 1603), knight of the Bath (23 July 1603), gentleman of the bedchamber (1605), Baron Herbert of Shurland, and first earl of Montgomery (4 May 1605). He accompanied James to Oxford in August 1605 and was created MA. He was a prominent participant in court tournaments and masques, and was passionately interested in both hunting and gambling: the king's favour was evident in James's reported willingness in 1606&#150;7 to pay Montgomery's extensive debts.<br>
<br>This royal favour continued despite Montgomery's growing reputation for rough, foul-mouthed, and even violent behaviour. In 1607 at Croydon races he so provoked William Ramsay, a page of the king's bedchamber, that Ramsay hit &#145;him on the face&#146;. In 1610 Montgomery had a quarrel with the earl of Southampton at a game of tennis, but the king mediated a reconciliation. While accompanying James on his journey to Scotland in 1617, Montgomery had a violent altercation with Lord Howard de Walden. Yet the king continued to bestow titles and offices upon him: knight of the Garter (23 April 1608), high steward of Oxford University (10 June 1615), keeper of Westminster Palace, Spring Gardens, and St James's Park (4 December 1617), lord lieutenant of Kent (17 March 1624), and privy councillor (December 1624). According to Clarendon, James recommended Montgomery to Charles &#145;as a man to be relied on in point of honesty and fidelity&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.74&#150;5) and in 1625 the new king appointed him one of the embassy to accompany Henrietta Maria from Paris to England. He carried the spurs at Charles I's coronation on 2 February 1626, and the following August succeeded his elder brother as lord chamberlain of the king's household. In 1628 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Montgomery was on friendly terms with Buckingham, who shared his interests in hunting and gambling, and their relationship was made easier by the fact that Montgomery lacked his elder brother's political interest and ambition. In September 1619 Buckingham became godfather to his son, Lord Charles Herbert (1619&#150;1636). The marriage agreement of 3 August 1626, whereby this boy was betrothed to Buckingham's four-year-old daughter, Mary, cemented a rapprochement between the duke and the Pembroke interest which helps to explain why Pembroke and his allies took a relatively moderate line during the 1628 parliament. Montgomery was at Portsmouth in August 1628 when Buckingham was assassinated.<br>
<br>Montgomery's first wife died in January 1629, and on 3 June 1630 he married Anne (1590&#150;1676) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5641/', "Clifford, Anne")</script>], widow of Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset, and daughter of George Clifford, third earl of Cumberland. On 10 April 1630 Montgomery became fourth earl of Pembroke on the death of his elder brother. This led to a series of further official appointments in which he succeeded his brother: he became lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, an office which he held from 1630 until his death, and he also served as lord lieutenant of Somerset (1630&#150;43) and Cornwall (1630&#150;42). On 12 August 1630 he was appointed high steward of the duchy of Cornwall and lord warden of the Stanneries in succession to his brother. In addition, his inheritance of the earldom of Pembroke brought him an extra income of &pound;14,000 a year, together with a further &pound;6000 a year belonging to his brother's deranged widow during her lifetime (she lived on until early 1650, the year of Pembroke's own death). John Aubrey estimated that his total income was about &pound;30,000 a year.<h2>
<a name="WiltonHouseandpatronageofthearts"></a>Wilton House and patronage of the arts</h2>Such revenue enabled Pembroke to live in lavish style, and he allegedly spent &pound;18,000 a year on hunting. He maintained a household of eighty in London, and another twice as large at his country seat at Wilton House, where he entertained the king every summer during the personal rule. Charles took a great interest in the earl's building operations as well as in his burgeoning art collection. In Aubrey's words, Pembroke:<blockquote>did not delight in books, or poetry: but exceedingly loved painting and building, in which he had singular judgement, and had the best collection of any peer in England, and was the great patron to Sir Anthony Van Dyck: and had most of his painting. (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 304)</blockquote>When in January 1637 a consignment of pictures arrived in London as a present from the pope to the king, Pembroke was among a select group (also comprising Henrietta Maria, the earl of Holland, and Inigo Jones) whom Charles invited to join him in opening the cases. From the early 1630s Pembroke employed Solomon De Caus to design a new palace at Wilton on a grandiose scale, surrounded by a variety of formal and informal gardens planned by his brother Isaac De Caus. The king had initially recommended that Pembroke employ Inigo Jones, and although Jones was too busy at Greenwich to accept the commission, he did provide the De Caus brothers with many suggestions. In 1647 a disastrous fire destroyed most of the house, and shortly afterwards Inigo Jones and John Webb designed a new house, in the Palladian style: this building incorporated those portions that had survived the fire and was completed in 1654.<br>
<br>Although not a man of books, Pembroke was active as a literary patron. During his lifetime he received the dedications of over forty separate publications, and of a further ten jointly with his elder brother. As early as 1619 he was the dedicatee of an English edition of the medieval romance <span class="italic">The Ancient, Famous and Honourable History of Amadis de Gaule</span>. He and his elder brother were the &#145;incomparable pair of brethren&#146; to whom the first folio of Shakespeare's works was dedicated in 1623. Three further examples, chosen almost at random, serve to indicate the remarkably wide range of works that were dedicated to him: Alice Sutcliffe's <span class="italic">Meditations of Man's Mortalitie</span> (1634); Sir Thomas Herbert's <span class="italic">A Relation of some Yeares Travaile, Begunne anno 1626. Into Afrique and the Greater Asia</span> (1634); and Alexander Read's <span class="italic">A Treatise of the First Part of Chirurgerie</span> (1638). He was a patron of his kinsman, the poet and divine George Herbert, and in 1630 he requested Charles I to present Herbert to the rectory of Fugglestone with Bemerton in Wiltshire. Like his mother and brother he was also a loyal patron of Philip Massinger, and after the dramatist's death in 1640 he continued to provide a pension for his widow. That same year he paid for a translation of Gilbert Saulnier's <span class="italic">The Love and Armes of the Greeke Princes</span>.<h2>
<a name="RelationshipwithCharlesI"></a>Relationship with Charles I</h2>Although they shared artistic and architectural interests, in other ways Charles and Pembroke were less in tune. Henrietta Maria disliked him, and in his religious beliefs the earl inclined towards godly protestantism. This was connected with his long-standing interest in colonial enterprises. A member of the council of the Virginia Company from 1612, he became one of the incorporators of the North-West Passage Company on 26 July 1612, and of the Guiana Company on 19 May 1626. He also became a member of the East India Company (1614), and later (February 1628) received a grant of the islands of Trinidad, Tobago, Barbados, and Fonseca. He was not well disposed towards Archbishop Laud, especially after the latter was elected in 1630, by a majority of only nine votes, to the third earl's old office of chancellor of Oxford University. Pembroke's position at court was further complicated by his incorrigibly rough manners: in February 1634, for example, he broke his staff over the back of Thomas May.<br>
<br>Pembroke's ambivalent relationship with the court, together with his religious sympathies, helps to explain why he strongly favoured peace during the campaigns against the Scots in 1639&#150;40. He was a commissioner for the negotiations at both Berwick and Ripon, and some of the Scottish covenanters, such as the earl of Rothes, regarded him as secretly sympathetic to them, a charge which he vigorously denied. Together with the earls of Holland and Salisbury, he urged Charles to accept the Scots' terms in October 1640, whereupon the king ordered him to return to London and to raise &pound;200,000 towards the costs of the campaign.<br>
<br>Thereafter Pembroke became rapidly more alienated from the court. By virtue of his many offices and his extensive estates, especially in Wiltshire and in central and southern Wales, he wielded considerable electoral influence. In the Short and Long parliaments the Commons probably contained about a dozen members who owed their seats directly to his patronage. Perhaps the most prominent member of the Pembroke interest was Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, and other notable figures included the earl's secretary, Michael Oldisworth, Samuel Turner, Sir Robert Pye, Thomas Pury, Sir Richard Wynne, and several of his own relatives. Politically the Pembroke network was rather disparate and never really formed a coherent group, although there is some evidence that in the Long Parliament elections Pembroke tended to support candidates known to be hostile to the exponents of &#145;Thorough&#146;. He subsequently voted in favour of Strafford's attainder, and on 3 May 1641 he greatly offended Charles by telling the anti-Straffordian demonstrators milling outside Westminster Hall that &#145;His Majesty had promised they should have speedy execution of justice to their desires&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Journal of the Daily Proceedings and Transactions in that Memorable Parliament, Begun at Westminster, 3 November, 1640</span>, 1641, 90).<br>
<br>The queen recommended that Pembroke be dismissed as lord chamberlain, and an opportunity soon presented itself. On 19 July he became involved in one of his periodic quarrels, this time with Lord Maltravers in a committee of the Lords: there was a violent altercation which culminated in his striking Maltravers twice with his staff. This episode provided the king with an excuse to demand Pembroke's resignation from his post, and shortly afterwards the earl of Essex was appointed to succeed him. This marked Pembroke's final breach with the court, but at the same time he won growing support from among the king's critics in the Commons. In August 1641 the Commons recommended that he be appointed lord steward when the king departed for Scotland. However, on 29 November Pembroke assured Sir Edward Nicholas, newly appointed as secretary of state, that he would never accept any office &#145;but by his Ma[jes]t[ie]s grace and nominacion&#146;  (Christ Church Muniment Room, Oxford, Evelyn collection, Nicholas letters, unfoliated, Pembroke to Nicholas, 29 Nov 1641), and Charles refused the Commons' request the following month.<h2>
<a name="Allegiancetoparliament16421648"></a>Allegiance to parliament, 1642&#150;1648</h2>Pembroke's subsequent allegiance to parliament was probably grounded on a mixture of personal alienation from the court and an underlying attachment to godly protestantism. Another consideration may well have been the fact that the Herbert family's ancient rivals for local dominance in Wiltshire, the Seymours, chose to become royalists. Clarendon also identified a further motive&#151;Pembroke's:<blockquote>fear, which was the passion always predominant in him above all his choler and rage, prevailed so far over him, that he gave himself up into the hands of the Lord Say to dispose of him as he thought fit. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.540)</blockquote>Pembroke was always a very moderate parliamentarian, and he was one of the peers most regularly involved as a messenger or negotiator between the houses and the king. On 9 March 1642 he and Holland met Charles at Royston where they presented him with a declaration from the houses detailing his misgovernment. In June he ignored the king's summons to York, yet he remained in touch with Edward Hyde and sent assurances of his loyalty to Charles. On 4 July he was one of five peers appointed to the committee of safety comprising members of both houses. Meanwhile, secret contacts between Hyde and Pembroke, with the latter's eldest son, Lord Herbert, acting as go-between, continued until early August. But on 8 August the houses appointed Pembroke governor of the Isle of Wight, and Clarendon later wrote that he &#145;kindly accepted it, as a testimony of their favour; and so got into actual rebellion, which he never intended to do&#146;  (ibid., 2.541). He was among the members of both houses who presented a petition to the king at Colnbrook on 11 November, and in January 1643 he was one of the commissioners sent to Charles at Oxford with peace propositions. He was present at the treaty of Uxbridge (January&#150;February 1645), and one night had a conversation with Hyde in which he allegedly &#145;told him that there was never such a pack of knaves and villains as they who now governed in the Parliament&#146;  (ibid., 3.494). Hyde felt that his adherence to parliament was guided principally by fear of losing Wilton and a desire to be on the winning side.<br>
<br>Certainly throughout the years of civil war Pembroke's political affiliations were highly changeable. He was intermittently associated with the Saye&#150;Northumberland group in the Lords which also included peers such as the earls of Kent, Nottingham, and Salisbury, and Lord Howard of Escrick, Lord North, and Lord Wharton. Like them he supported the self-denying ordinance and the creation of the New Model Army in 1645. In March 1646, along with Saye, Northumberland, Wharton, and Salisbury, he was appointed to the committee of revenue, and thereafter this group wielded considerable influence over the exchequer. Yet from August 1646 he started to distance himself from the Saye&#150;Northumberland group, and by May 1647 he had emerged as one of the army's most outspoken critics and a vigorous advocate of its speedy disbandment. On 3 May he delivered a speech to the common council of the City of London in which he allegedly asserted that the army was &#145;no longer the New Modle for there were 7000 Cavaliers in it&#146;  (DWL, MS 24.50, diary of Thomas Juxon, fol. 107), and that &#145;hee conceived it were high time they were disbanded&#146;  (C. H. Firth, ed., <span class="italic">The Clarke Papers</span>, 4 vols., CS, new ser., 49, 54, 61&#150;2, 1891&#150;1901, 1.26).<br>
<br>Pembroke's speech to the London common council may well have helped to strengthen the growing hostility towards the army felt within the capital. When on 26 July rioters besieged the houses of parliament in support of the presbyterian leaders and their attempts to disband the army, Sir John Maynard alleged that Pembroke &#145;was all for the apprentices, and incouraged them&#146;  (Beinecke Library, Yale University, Osborn MS Fb 155, commonplace book of John Browne, fol. 239). Unlike other peers associated with the Saye&#150;Northumberland group he did not flee to the army and instead continued to attend the house. But when, early in August, the army entered London and reinstated the members of both houses who had fled, Pembroke claimed that he had been acting under duress. He now once again insisted that he was a friend to the army and tried to identify himself with the proposed settlement promoted that summer by such peers as Saye, Northumberland, Wharton, and Salisbury. James Howell attributed this change of heart to Saye's continuing influence over the earl  (<span class="italic">A Letter to the Earle of Pembrooke Concerning the Times, and the Sad Condition both of Prince and People</span>, 1647, 12). Pembroke's manoeuvres prompted the royalist earl of Dorset, in a letter to his son-in-law, the parliamentarian earl of Middlesex, to observe with heavy sarcasm that: &#145;You cannott suffer, while you have soe sure and constant a man amongst you &hellip; Paraselsus himselfe cowld never have fixed the mercuriall spirit thatt predominates in his breast: if hee weere alive to practise on him&#146;  (Dorset to second earl of Middlesex, 1 Aug 1647, Centre for Kentish Studies, Sackville MS, U 269/C248, unfoliated). Likewise, a contemporary satire bitingly applied the phrase &#145;life of loyalty&#146; to Pembroke  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 357, political satires, fol. 37<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Pembroke's religious attitudes were similarly complex. He was clearly unsympathetic towards Laudianism and inclined towards godly protestantism. From 1643 he served as a member of the Westminster assembly. As the 1640s progressed, he emerged as a supporter of moderate episcopacy whose most consistent priority was an Erastian hostility to the more radical demands of both the high presbyterians and the Independents. In November 1644 he and the earl of Warwick went to the Westminster assembly and &#145;chide the Independ[en]ts for retardeinge the worke of Reformation[n]&#146;  (DWL, MS 24.50, fol. 27). He supported Laud's attainder in January 1645, but in March 1646 he voted to reject the high presbyterian petition submitted by the City of London. Evidence of his moderate episcopalianism may be found in his choice of the future bishop of Winchester, George Morley, as his domestic chaplain, as well as in the nature of his ecclesiastical patronage within the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, of which he was a resident.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his changeable political associations, Pembroke remained sufficiently trusted within the houses to be appointed to a range of further offices. In July 1644 he became lord lieutenant of Somerset, and on 1 December 1645 the houses voted him a dukedom. On 27 July 1648 the Lords sought the Commons' agreement to his appointment as constable of Windsor Castle and keeper of Windsor Great Park, although the consent of the lower house was not forthcoming until 19 December. Perhaps most notably, on 6 July 1641, following Laud's imprisonment, he had been elected to the chancellorship of Oxford University. It was indicative of his political alignments that Pembroke nominated Saye to succeed him as high steward of the university. When Oxford became the king's headquarters, the marquess of Hertford displaced Pembroke as chancellor, but on 3 August 1647 the houses issued an ordinance for his restoration. This followed an earlier ordinance (1 May 1647) &#145;for the visitation and reformation of the University of Oxford&#146; and the &#145;due correction of offences, abuses, and disorders, especially of late times, committed there&#146;  (C. H. Firth and R. S. Rait, eds., <span class="italic">Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642&#150;1660</span>, 3 vols., 1911, 1.925&#150;7).<br>
<br>The visitors, led by Sir Nathaniel Brent, began work at Oxford in September 1647, directed by a committee of both houses in London under the chairmanship of Pembroke. Their instruction that all university officers should take the solemn league and covenant encountered so much resistance that the heads of houses were summoned before the committee in November, where Pembroke soundly berated them. In February 1648 he nominated a new vice-chancellor, Dr Reynolds, together with many new heads of houses. A parliamentary order of 8 March instructed him to take possession of his place as chancellor, and the following month he entered Oxford in person and presided in convocation. Thereafter the visitors encountered little resistance and harsh measures were imposed on the recalcitrant. No fewer than eight royalist satires were published in London and Oxford, mercilessly lampooning Pembroke's lack of scholarly pretensions. Among the most mordant was <span class="italic">Newes from Pembroke and Mongomery, or, Oxford Manchester'd</span> (1648), attributed to Sir John Berkenhead, which presented a mock speech by Pembroke as chancellor containing such choice phrases as: &#145;I love the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, though I seldome use it; I say I love it &hellip; I can love it though I cannot read it&#146;; and &#145;my name may be French, for I cannot spell English&#146;  (pp. 2, 5). Anthony Wood later wrote that Pembroke was &#145;so foul-mouthed and so eloquent in swearing that he was thought more fit to preside over a Bedlam than a learned academy&#146;  (Burrows, lxx).<h2>
<a name="Pembrokesresponsetothecrisisof16481649"></a>Pembroke's response to the crisis of 1648&#150;1649</h2>Events on the national scene were meanwhile moving ever more rapidly. In January 1648, believing the king to be indispensable to any settlement, Pembroke opposed the vote of no addresses and resolutely refused to leave Wilton in order to attend the Lords' debates upon it. The fire at Wilton in 1647, together with the depredations of civil war, eroded his finances, and his total income in 1648 was estimated at &pound;20,203, a sum which exceeded his total expenses by only &pound;1064  (Elmhirst MS, Pye deposit, EM 1356, EM 1359). In July 1648 he voted that the duke of Hamilton, who had led the recent Scottish intervention into England, be declared a traitor, and the following month he wished to see those English royalists who had assisted the Scottish invasion declared traitors: he entered his dissent when this proposal was defeated. In the autumn he was among the parliamentarian commissioners appointed to negotiate with the king at the treaty of Newport, and at the beginning of December he accepted the king's concessions as a basis for further talks. After Pride's Purge brought the treaty to an abrupt halt Pembroke, together with Denbigh, Mulgrave, and Lord Grey of Warke, formed a deputation to Fairfax on about 10 December, the main purpose of which appears to have been &#145;to assure him of their support of the Army's position with respect to the House of Lords&#146;  (I. Gentles, <span class="italic">The New Model Army in England, Ireland and Scotland, 1645&#150;1653</span>, 1992, 298). Then, on 19 December, he joined Salisbury and Northumberland in the delegation which Denbigh led to the council of officers in an eleventh-hour attempt to secure a possible compromise by which Charles would abandon his negative voice, consent to the perpetual alienation of bishops' lands, and abjure the Scots.<br>
<br>Although the Denbigh initiative failed, Cromwell and other leading army officers seem to have been keen to cultivate Pembroke's support. On that same day, 19 December, the earl's secretary, Michael Oldisworth, conveyed to the Lords the Commons' consent to an ordinance appointing Pembroke as constable of Windsor Castle, thus making him in effect the king's gaoler. Pembroke promptly appointed as his deputy Bulstrode Whitelocke, whom he appears to have regarded as an ally. On 2 January 1649 Pembroke was appointed to the high court of justice to try the king. However, he reportedly &#145;swore he loved not to meddle with businesses of life and death and (for his part) hee would neither speake against the ordinance nor consent to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, nos. 40&#150;41, 26 Dec 1648&#150;9 Jan 1649, 2 Jan 1649).<h2>
<a name="Pembrokesdeath"></a>Pembroke's death</h2>Despite such prevarication the Rump still wished to secure Pembroke's support, and on 14 February 1649 he was appointed a member of the newly established council of state. The fact that he was one of five peers so nominated, only a week after the abolition of the Lords, is indicative &#145;of the boundaries of the Rump's revolutionary zeal&#146;  (B. Worden, <span class="italic">The Rump Parliament, 1648&#150;1653</span>, 1974, 178). When the Rump decided to permit the election of peers as commoners, Pembroke (like Salisbury and Howard of Escrick, but unlike Saye and Wharton) was among those who stood for election; he was returned on 16 April 1649 as member for Berkshire. However, he appears to have played little further part in public affairs, and the evidence of apothecaries' bills suggests that he began to suffer from his final illness during May. He died at his lodgings in The Cockpit, Westminster, on 23 January 1650. His body was embalmed at a cost of &pound;118 17<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and he was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 9 February. The council of state ordered all members of parliament to accompany his cort&egrave;ge for 2 or 3 miles on the journey out of London.<h2>
<a name="Thefifthearl"></a>The fifth earl</h2>Pembroke's fourth, and eldest surviving, son from his first marriage, <a name="cosubject_13043"></a><span class="headword">Philip Herbert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1621, <em>d.</em> 1669)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded him as fifth earl of Pembroke. He was baptized at Enfield on 21 February 1621 and educated at Westminster School and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 20 April 1632. From 1636 onwards he was styled Lord Herbert, and between 1635 and 1637 he travelled in France and Italy. On 28 March 1639 he married Sir Robert Naunton's daughter Penelope (<i>b</i>. 1620), the widow of Viscount Bayning. That year he also served with the king as a captain during the first bishops' war.<br>
<br>The fifth earl sat for Wiltshire in the Short Parliament, and for Glamorgan in the Long Parliament. Like his father he sided with the parliamentarians in the civil wars, and on his father's death he took over his seat for Berkshire in the Rump Parliament. His first wife had died by 1647 and in or before 1649 he married Katherine Villiers (<i>d</i>. 1678), daughter of Sir William Villiers and Rebecca Roper. Pembroke was elected a member of the council of state on 1 December 1651, and briefly served as president of the council from 3 June to 13 July 1652. In 1655 he was appointed a militia commissioner for south Wales, and in 1659 the council of state accepted his offer to raise a regiment of horse at his own charge.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Pembroke made his peace with Charles II and was appointed a councillor for trade and navigation on 7 November 1660. He bore the spurs and acted as cupbearer at Charles II's coronation on 23 April 1661. According to Aubrey, the fifth earl &#145;had an admirable witt, and was contemplative but did not much care for reading. His chiefest diversion was Chymistrie, which his Lordship did understand very well and he made Medicines, that did great cures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 304) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107538/', "Society of Chemical Physicians")</script>]. He died on 11 December 1669 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 24 December.<br>
<br>The only son of his first marriage, William Herbert (1640&#150;1674), succeeded him as sixth earl of Pembroke. He was granted a pass to travel overseas in September 1658. He was member for Glamorgan between 1661 and 1669, and he died unmarried on 8 July 1674. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 1 August 1674.<h2>
<a name="TheinfamousseventhearlofPembroke16531683"></a>The infamous seventh earl of Pembroke, 1653&#150;1683</h2>The eldest son of the fifth earl's second marriage, <a name="cosubject_13044"></a><span class="headword">Philip Herbert</span>  (1653&#150;1683)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded William Herbert as seventh earl of Pembroke. In character, he was in many ways a throwback to his paternal grandfather and namesake, only in a more extreme form. Aubrey observed in 1680 that Pembroke had &#145;at Wilton 52 mastives and 30 grey-hounds, some beares, and a lyon, and a matter of 60 fellowes more bestial then they&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 305). The earl quickly acquired an unenviable reputation for barbarous and violent behaviour. He nearly killed a man in a duel in November 1677. On 28 January 1678 the lord chancellor informed the House of Lords that the king had committed Pembroke to the Tower &#145;for uttering such horrid and blasphemous words, and other actions proved upon oath, as are not fit to be repeated in any Christian assembly&#146;. Pembroke submitted a petition to his fellow peers, claiming to &#145;detest and abhor&#146; the words of which he stood accused, and hoping that, as he was accused by only one witness, the peers &#145;will not believe the accusation, or your petitioner capable of so horrid a crime&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 13.131&#150;2). The house thereupon resolved (with seven bishops, Lord Berkeley, and the duke of York entering their dissents) to petition the king for Pembroke's release, which Charles granted on 30 January.<br>
<br>However, only a few days later, on 5 February 1678, Philip Rycaut complained to the Lords that Pembroke had assaulted him in the Strand on 2 February. The Lords responded by ordering the earl to give security by a recognizance of &pound;2000 to keep the peace towards Rycaut and all the king's other subjects. Meanwhile, on 4 February Pembroke had killed Nathaniel Cony in a drunken scuffle in a Haymarket tavern; one week later the Middlesex grand jury convicted him of murder. He submitted another petition to the Lords, and was tried by his peers on 4 April: six found him guilty of murder, eighteen not guilty, and forty guilty of manslaughter. He then &#145;prayed that he might have his privilege of peerage&#146;: this was granted and he was discharged upon payment of his fees  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 13.200).<br>
<br>The rake's progress continued thereafter, and on 18 August 1680 Pembroke killed an officer of the watch, William Smeeth, while returning from a drinking binge at Turnham Green. The Middlesex grand jury tried him on 21 June 1681 and found him guilty of murder. He could not claim privilege of peerage a second time, but on this occasion, following a petition on his behalf to the king signed by twenty-four peers, he was granted a royal pardon and discharged. He died on 29 August 1683, aged only thirty, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 10 September. On 17 December 1674 he had married Henrietta de K&eacute;roualle (<i>d</i>. 1728), sister of Charles II's mistress, Louise de K&eacute;roualle, duchess of Portsmouth. They had one daughter, Catherine, who married, first, John Jeffreys, second Baron Jeffreys of Wem, and second, Thomas Windsor, first Viscount Windsor. Pembroke was succeeded by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13050/', "Thomas Herbert (1656/7&#150;1733)")</script>, who became eighth earl of Pembroke.<br>
