<span class="headword">O'Healy <span class="st"> [O'Hely]</span>,  Patrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1579), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Mayo and martyr</span>, may have been from Dromahair, co. Leitrim, or have been a member of the friary there. Having already taken his vows as a Franciscan, he arrived in Rome from Ireland in 1562, where he impressed the minister-general of the Observant Franciscans with his piety and intelligence. O'Healy was sent to Spain, where he studied grammar for two years at the friary of St Francis in Molina de Aragon, philosophy for four years in the friary in San Clemente, and theology in the University of Alcal&aacute;. He became fluent in Catalan and was described as a good preacher.<br>
<br>About 1574&#150;5, O'Healy became associated with a circle of exiled Irish who were urging Spanish military intervention in Ireland. He arrived in Rome on 16 June 1575, with letters of accreditation from Philip II and began canvassing support for James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, a charismatic adventurer who wanted to lead a papal-sponsored crusade to Ireland. Frequently in contact with the Spanish papal ambassador, O'Healy spoke with Pope Gregory XIII about the persecution suffered by Irish Catholics. During his stay in Rome, he made enough of an impression to be consecrated as bishop of Mayo on 4 July 1576. In late 1576 he left for Madrid to bring the pope's invasion plan before Philip. Preparations gradually came to fruition, and on 18 November 1577 he set sail with Fitzgerald for Ireland as part of a small invasion force. However, severe storms caused them to put to harbour at Corunna in Galicia. There, the Breton captain and his crew refused to honour their contract by proceeding and were imprisoned, but on 5 January 1578 they escaped and made off with the ship.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald followed the crew to Brittany, while O'Healy journeyed to Paris, where on 7 April he secured a royal warrant for restitution of the stolen goods. At this point, O'Healy appears to have lost interest in Fitzgerald's crusade and did not play any part in the latter's renewed efforts to head an invasion of Ireland. O'Healy remained in Paris for about nine months, living in the Franciscan friary and engaging in academic disputations. In early 1579 he left Paris for Brittany, from where he took ship for Ireland.<br>
<br>O'Healy and his travelling companion, Conn O'Rourke, a friar and the son of an Irish chieftain, landed at Smerwick, co. Kerry, shortly before Fitzgerald's forces landed at the same harbour on 18 June 1579. O'Healy and O'Rourke hastened to the seat of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, at Askeaton, co. Limerick, probably to encourage him to rebel. Desmond was absent, but his wife entertained them for three days. The earl's relationship with the government was tense at best and the actions of fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, his cousin, placed him in a very dangerous position. Either on her own initiative or at her husband's behest, the countess of Desmond sent a messenger to the mayor of Limerick informing him of O'Healy's presence. On leaving Askeaton, O'Healy and O'Rourke headed north towards Limerick, probably on their way to Connaught, but the forewarned authorities captured them <i>en route</i>.<br>
<br>O'Healy and O'Rourke were imprisoned in Limerick and tried under martial law by the lord president of Munster, Sir William Drury. O'Healy was tortured in an unsuccessful attempt to gain details of fitz Maurice Fitzgerald's plans. As part of this process, spikes were driven through his hands, severing his fingers. Drury then offered O'Healy the peaceful possession of his see, if he would renounce his faith, but he refused. Sentenced to death, O'Healy and O'Rourke were hanged about 13 August 1579 outside Kilmallock, co. Limerick. A woodcut of the hanging bodies was made and appears in Richard Verstegan's <span class="italic">Theatrum crudelitatum haereticorum nostri temporis</span> (1587). The bodies were left hanging for a week, before John fitz Edmund Fitzgerald of Desmond arranged for their burial on 27 August at Clonmel, co. Tipperary. In 1647 the bodies were transferred to the Franciscan house at Askeaton. O'Healy was the first Catholic bishop to be executed in Ireland since the advent of the Reformation and he quickly became the subject of a number of martyrologies. He was beatified in 1992.<br>
