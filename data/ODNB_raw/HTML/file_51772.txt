<span class="headword">Bunker,  Henry James</span>  (1897&#150;1975), <span class="occ">microbiologist</span>, was born in London on 27 April 1897, younger son and third child of Charles James Garibaldi Bunker (1864&#150;1916), a pharmacist, and his wife, Kate Waterfield (1862&#150;1944). He was educated at St Olave's Grammar School, London, from 1906. His schooling completed in 1915, he served in the First World War as an NCO and later a commissioned officer of the South Wales Borderers. Following demobilization in 1919 he went up to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and took a degree in natural sciences with botany as his principal subject.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1922 Bunker married Pauline Rosemary (Pearl) Delahunty (<i>d</i>. 1950); they later had two sons and two daughters. It was also in 1922 that Bunker became assistant bacteriologist in a microbiology research group led by A. C. Thaysen at the Royal Naval cordite factory at Holton Heath, where he studied such practical problems as the fermentation of vegetable matter to produce fuel alcohol, and the microbial degradation of textiles and rope. Together with Thaysen he published a standard work on microbes. When the tomb of Tutankhamen at Karnak was opened by Howard Carter in 1924 Bunker was sent samples of the mummy's wrappings and other materials from the tomb, and he showed that, as far as current techniques could detect, no microbes survived.<br>
<br>In 1933 Thaysen's research group was transferred to the Chemical Research Laboratory, Teddington; its research interests had expanded. Bunker had now become interested in damage to materials caused by sulphur bacteria, especially the sulphate reducing bacteria. His 1936 review of these organisms was a seminal contribution to subsequent research. Nevertheless, he regularly attended to <i>ad hoc</i> problems involving microbes, such as the blackening of paint by fungi, taint in fish caused by bacteria, and microbial degradation of stored ropes. During the blitzkrieg of 1940&#150;41 damage to wet fire hoses became a serious problem; Bunker showed that it was caused by sulphur bacteria forming acid from sulphur, a vulcanizing agent in the rubber, and was able to prescribe remedies. But during the Second World War the group's major project, to make edible yeast from waste molasses as a protein rich food supplement, largely displaced other research themes. It kindled in Bunker a long-lasting interest in yeast and food microbiology. At the end of the war he was one of many British scientists sent to defeated Germany to assess the state of its science and technology.<br>
<br>In 1944 Bunker left the Teddington group to set up and direct a research department for a London brewer, Barclay-Perkins. He found the practical microbiological problems of the industry, ranging from the fermentation process itself to washing-up glassware in public houses, of absorbing interest, and he published widely. However, in 1956 Barclay-Perkins was taken over by a larger firm and Bunker's laboratory was closed. Although of an age at which many might have retired, he used his wide professional experience to embark upon a new and highly successful career as a freelance consultant on microbiological problems in industry.<br>
<br>Bunker was one of the first British experts on microbial activities in non-medical contexts. Although he himself was mainly concerned with practical problems, he was a firm believer in the need for fundamental research. He played an important role in bringing about the recognition of microbiology as a distinctive discipline within biology. He became an influential figure in learned organizations concerned with both basic and applied microbiology; in 1945 he helped found the Society for General Microbiology; he became its first treasurer and was its president during 1952&#150;5; he was also president of the Society for Applied Bacteriology, 1946&#150;9. He represented microbiology at the inception of the Institute of Biology in 1950, was elected a fellow, and was president, 1967&#150;9; he was also a fellow of the Institute of Food Science and Technology. He held forty-eight distinguished and honorific positions; he was especially pleased by a DTech conferred upon him in 1969 by Brunel University, and a DSc conferred by the Bath University of Technology in 1970. In all his offices he was notable for his tact, friendliness, and self-deprecating humour, yet as a chairman would display a firm and businesslike grasp of the discussion.<br>
<br>A popular after-dinner speaker who could draw upon a fund of comic anecdotes, Bunker was an outgoing and engaging man who enjoyed good food, drink, sociability, and travel. His cheerful personality sustained him through a persistent nephritis which, over the last thirty years of his life, resulted in his needing a number of quite serious kidney operations. On 21 April 1970, twenty years after the death of his first wife, Bunker married his companion, secretary, and friend, Marie Travers 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Currivan; <i>d</i>. 1992)
  . He continued his consultancy work until his death from pancreatic cancer on 8 August 1975 at Teddington Memorial Hospital. He was cremated at south-west Middlesex crematorium on 13 August.<br>
