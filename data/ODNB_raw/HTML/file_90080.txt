<span class="headword">Box,  Henry</span>  (1585&#150;1662), <span class="occ">educational benefactor</span>, was born on 25 July 1585, the second son of Thomas Box (<i>bap</i>. 1552), fuller and farmer of Witney, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Rankell; he had at least two brothers and two sisters. The Box family had been settled in Witney by about 1450. Both Henry's grandfathers were substantial clothiers, while his father earned &pound;100 per annum from dressing cloth at a mill that he built in the 1580s.<br>
<br>Henry Box matriculated as a plebeian from Oriel College, Oxford, on 24 October 1600. Although he did not graduate, he showed his loyalty to his college in 1641 when he gave communion plate to its newly rebuilt chapel. In 1604 he was apprenticed to the London Grocers' Company, in which his kinsmen had served as master and warden under Elizabeth I. Having become free of the company in 1612 he was elected to its livery in 1621 and to its court in 1638. Box married twice. His first wife was the daughter of one Thompson: they had one daughter, Sarah, who married a Leghorn merchant. Henry's second wife, whom he had married by 1623, was <a name="cosubject_95021"></a><span class="headword">Mary Box <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Allen]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">educational benefactor</span>, the daughter of Ralph Allen (<i>b</i>. 1556) and his wife, Alice Long. Her father was the second son of Sir William Allen, lord mayor of London in 1572; her mother was the daughter of Henry Long (<i>d</i>. 1611) of Whaddon, Wiltshire, and aunt of the politician Walter Long. Henry and Mary had four sons (the eldest was baptized in June 1623) and three daughters, of whom one son, Ralph, and one daughter, Alice, who married the exchequer auditor William Hill, survived their father. From 1616 until his death Box leased a large house, with shop and warehouse attached, on Cheapside, in the parish of St Mary Colechurch. He lived there until he moved to Hammersmith, Middlesex, probably in the 1650s.<br>
<br>Box was by trade a druggist, &#145;one of the best in all Europe&#146;, Samuel Hartlib noted in 1649; the following year he recorded that Box had a good stock of Virginia snakeroot  (Hartlib papers, 28/1/2B). Box's clientele went beyond Hartlib's reforming circle. In 1649 the agent of Edward Conway, second Viscount Conway, wrote to his master of a three-year-old bill owed to Box. His business involved strong links with Norwich, where at the time of his death he owned a warehouse, and he also had important connections with Amsterdam, dealing in goods that, as he explained in 1651, &#145;are here much wanting both in the use of Phisick and Surgery&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34326, fol. 14<i>r</i>). He was describing a consignment of commodities valued at almost &pound;3000, one that witnesses both to the scale of Box's dealings and to the range of his imports: as well as drugs, he was importing verdigris worth &pound;533, while &#145;Dutch hard barley&#146; made up almost half the value of the cargo  (ibid., fol. 15<i>r</i>). It also included clover seed worth &pound;100, a highly profitable import at a time when demand from agricultural improvers, stimulated by the Hartlib circle's propaganda, was outrunning supply.<br>
<br>Box was elected master of the Grocers' Company on 15 July 1640 but declined to serve for a fine of 100 marks, citing &#145;many infirmities&#146;  (Wales and Hartley, 2.426). He was as reluctant to serve in prominent civic offices. In 1639 he paid a fine to avoid serving as sheriff of London and Middlesex, and was equally unwilling when elected alderman of Bridge Within ward on 14 March 1650. He was committed to Newgate a week later for refusing to accept the office. When he was finally sworn on 15 August, he was discharged the same day upon a fine of &pound;500. It is not clear how far these evasions of office were a matter of political prudence, or indeed, by 1650, alienation from the regime. A similar uncertainty attaches to the permission he received from the council of state in 1651 to send &pound;25 to a Scottish colonel captured at the battle of Worcester and imprisoned in Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>Box died, probably at Hammersmith, in 1662, between 13 February, when he made his will, and 7 July, when his widow, appointed sole executor, proved it. As he wished, he was buried in Witney church. The inventory of his house at Hammersmith valued his personal estate at &pound;646 13<i>s</i>. He had evidently not entirely withdrawn from his business: the inventory noted a warehouse, and in a loft hartshorn worth &pound;100. By the time of his death he held property in London, Middlesex, Berkshire, Norfolk, and in Oxfordshire, where he leased half the fulling mill built by his father in Witney and, from September 1661, the manor of Dean and Chalford.<br>
<br>Box's will included a range of charitable gifts: he left &pound;20 to the poor of Witney and &pound;10 to those of Hammersmith and &pound;30 to the parish of St Mary Colechurch, and he gave the Grocers' Company &pound;100, which was to be lent interest-free in succession to young freemen who were druggists, with preference to those who had been servants to Box or his late master. His most significant benefaction, however, was the grammar school that he endowed at Witney. In 1660 he built a schoolhouse on a site that he had bought adjoining the rectory. He had also probably acquired many of the books that became the core of the school's impressive library by the time of his death. His inventory records his ownership of &#145;12 Tomes of the new translated bibles in the Orientall Tongues&#146;, suggesting that he possessed two copies of Brian Walton's six-volume polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1654&#150;7), one of which became part of the school library  (TNA: PRO, PROB 4/13489).<br>
<br>Box died before he could finish setting up the school, but he left an endowment of &pound;50 per annum for its maintenance, and committed the school to the charge of his widow. In 1663 Mary Box procured an act of parliament establishing the school as the Witney Free Grammar School, with the four wardens of the Grocers' Company being appointed its governors and the provost and four senior fellows of Oriel College its visitors. However, Mary's influence over the school remained extensive. By the act she retained full control over the school, and in accordance with Henry's expressed wishes was authorized to draw up the school's statutes, which she signed in December 1674, and which were so detailed as to ordain the weekly dusting of the books in the library. To the master and usher who were to teach &#145;the originall and learned languages&#146; (Latin, Greek, and, in theory, Hebrew) she added a master to teach the scholars to write and cast accounts, funded from an additional rent-charge of &pound;13 per annum  (Fleming, 4). She seems to have attended the annual meetings on the anniversary of Henry's birth when the Oriel fellows visited the school. On such days her statutes required that the boys were to pray for both Henry and herself as the school's founders.<br>
<br>Mary Box's statutes provided for thirty foundation scholars, from the descendants of Henry Box or from the town or outlying hamlets of Witney, for whom the entrance fee was 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. (reduced to 1<i>s</i>. where the parents were poor). The master and usher could take on a larger number of non-foundation scholars, with whom they negotiated the fees: early pupils included one of Henry and Mary's grandsons. Mary Box also shaped the school through her choice of the first two masters of the school. Both were strong loyalist Anglicans of academic distinction: Francis Gregory, formerly master of Woodstock School and the author of a Greek&#150;Latin dictionary, and Edward Hinton, later master of Kilkenny College.<br>
<br>Mary Box remained an active manager of the family property. She renegotiated several of Henry's leases as they came due and invested heavily in restocking the demesne at Dean and Chalford. She bought land in Twickenham, Middlesex, and the manor and advowson of Iping, Sussex. For some years of her widowhood she lived in Teddington, Middlesex, with or near her daughter Alice, but by the time that she made her will on 1 June 1678 she was living in London. She died in December 1679 and was buried beside her husband in Witney church. Her third-born but only surviving son, Sir Ralph Box (1627&#150;1694), followed his father as a druggist and was three times warden of the Grocers' Company. In the early 1680s he was caught up in the contest for the control of London between the crown and its whig adversaries, culminating in a bitterly fought election to the shrievalty in 1682. He and his tory colleague were declared the winners, but Box felt unable to continue and withdrew. He had necessarily been involved in securing the future of Witney school, but directed his own beneficence to the church and the City, contributing to the rebuilding of St Mildred Poultry after the great fire, and in his will making substantial bequests to Christ's Hospital, St Thomas's Hospital, Bridewell, and Bedlam (Bethlem Hospital).<br>
<br>The school founded by Sir Ralph's parents still flourishes. In 1969, by now the Witney grammar and technical school, it was reorganized and renamed as the Henry Box comprehensive school. The original schoolhouse is now the Mary Box building.<br>
