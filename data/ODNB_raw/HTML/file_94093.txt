<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elis,  Islwyn Ffowc</span>  (1924&#150;2004), <span class="occ">Welsh-language writer</span>, was born Islwyn Foulkes Ellis on 17 November 1924 at 12 The Beeches, Acton Park, his aunt's home in Wrexham, Denbighshire, the elder son of Edward Ivor Ellis (1887&#150;1964), a tenant farmer of Glynceiriog, Denbighshire, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kenrick (1892&#150;1963), who was the ninth of the eleven children of Samuel Kenrick, a tenant farmer of Ruabon in the same county. Named after the mystic poet Islwyn 
    (William Thomas; 1832&#150;1878)
  , he was raised first in Glynceiriog and then, from the age of five, at the family farm, Aberwiel, just outside the village. Although his mother's first language was English, and notwithstanding the fact that the border with England was less than two miles to the east, the Ellis home was cultured and staunchly Welsh-speaking; like most country children at that time, Ellis spoke no English until the age of ten. He was to make much of the differences between his people and their English neighbours: &#145;We in our mountain valley spoke Welsh. They on the plain spoke English. We could sing spontaneously in harmony. They could not. We talked of preachers and poets, they of footballers and racehorses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Artists in Wales</span>, 144).<br>
<br>At grammar school in Llangollen, some twenty-six miles distant from his home, Ellis was taunted by teachers on account of his patriotism (he had begun to use the Welsh forms of his surname) but distinguished himself academically and went to the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in 1942. There he began writing verse, stories, and essays, won the crown at the University of Wales inter-college eisteddfod, and joined Plaid Cymru&#151;the start of his lifelong commitment to the cause of political nationalism. (He stood as the party's candidate in Montgomeryshire, a bastion of Liberalism, in 1962 and 1964, did a stint as editor of its newspaper, and played a key role as press and publications officer in the Carmarthen by-election of 1966 at which Gwynfor Evans won the party's first seat at Westminster.) After taking a degree in Welsh and philosophy at Bangor he spent two years at the theological college in Aberystwyth, followed by a year's pre-ordination training at Bala, before realizing his father's ambition for him to be a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Wales. During the Second World War he had been a conscientious objector on Christian pacifist grounds.<br>
<br>In 1950 Elis (as he was now known) became a minister of the Calvinistic Methodists in Llanfair Caereinion, in northern Montgomeryshire. On 28 October the same year he married Eirlys Rees Owen (<i>d</i>. 2007), the 23-year-old daughter of Lewis Rees Owen, farmer, of Tywyn, Merioneth. They had one daughter. Despite a friendship with the poet R. S. Thomas, who held the living of nearby Manafon and whom he helped to master Welsh, Elis was unhappy in Montgomeryshire, mainly because he did not feel himself suited to pastoral work but also because he was suffering a deep crisis of conscience that brought him close to complete breakdown. In three articles for <span class="italic">Y Drysorfa</span>, the denomination's magazine, in February, May, and August 1955, he questioned the contemporary relevance of the church, criticized its constitution, proposed the closure of all places of worship in favour of house meetings, and claimed that church allegiance was little more than &#145;the instinctive attachment of human nature to what is familiar and customary&#146;. His already nervous disposition was exacerbated by what he considered his &#145;utter failure&#146; as a man of the cloth, and he left the ministry in 1956 to return to Bangor, where for the next seven years he worked as a producer of radio programmes for the BBC and by writing.<br>
<br>It is ironic that Montgomeryshire, the county where he had been so cast down by his own sense of inadequacy and inaptitude as a clergyman, was the setting of two of Elis's sunniest and most popular novels: <span class="italic">Cysgod y cryman</span> (1953), and its sequel, <span class="italic">Yn &ocirc;l i Lleifior</span> (1956). They tell the story of the Vaughans of Lleifior, a prosperous farm in upland Montgomeryshire, and the pressures brought upon Edward Vaughan, the father, by the changing social conditions of the post-war years. His son Harri rebels against the old Liberal values of Edwardian Wales and, embracing communism, resolves to run the farm on co-operative lines. The Lleifior books were a milestone in the history of the Welsh novel by virtue of their contemporaneity and inventiveness, which, after decades of heavily didactic writing in stiff and often archaic language, delighted younger readers. Among a host of memorable characters are two nonconformist ministers, one doctrinally old-fashioned and socially inept, the other well-read, open-minded, and ready to meet the world in all its challenging complexity, even to treat Harri Vaughan's atheism seriously; the author left no doubt as to which kind he preferred and had tried to be. One of the bravest things the novels did was to present a sympathetic portrait of &#145;the good German&#146;, the saintly Karl Weissman, who, after working on the Lleifior land as a prisoner of war, chooses to stay on after 1945, learns Welsh, and eventually, after much tribulation and on the very last page of the latter novel, becomes engaged to Greta Vaughan, Harri's vivacious sister. The books sold in their thousands and remained in print throughout Elis's lifetime. Translated, abridged for Welsh learners, adapted for radio and television, and put on the syllabus of the Welsh Joint Education Committee, they became classics of modern Welsh literature. There was no dissent when, in 1999, <span class="italic">Cysgod y cryman</span> was chosen as &#145;Welsh book of the century&#146; alongside its English-language counterpart, the <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> of R. S. Thomas.<br>
<br>In 1963 Elis joined the staff of Trinity College, Carmarthen, as a lecturer in Welsh and drama, but he remained in the post for only five years. He then worked as an editor and translator with the Welsh Books Council in Aberystwyth, where he used his French, Italian, and German, but found that having to deal with other writers' manuscripts had a baneful effect on his own work and temperament. After four more years as a freelance writer in Wrexham he took a lecturer's post at St David's University College, Lampeter, where he was appointed reader in 1984 and where he remained until his retirement in 1988. His students at Lampeter found him a conscientious and inspiring teacher, happiest when encouraging young people to write.<br>
<br>Although he was never again to produce anything as good as the Lleifior novels, Elis published a number of books in which he continued to demonstrate a mastery of style and range of subjects which won him many more admirers. For his essays, <span class="italic">Cyn oeri'r gwaed</span> (&#145;Before the blood runs cold&#146;, 1952), he was awarded the prose medal at the national eisteddfod. His second novel, <span class="italic">Ffenestri tua'r gwyll</span> (&#145;Windows towards the twilight&#146;, 1953), was set in the world of the arts and is a study of a wealthy, sophisticated, neurotic, sexually frustrated, middle-aged woman who dominates and exploits the writers and painters who rely on her patronage. Other novels followed in quick succession. <span class="italic">Wythnos yng Nghymru fydd</span> (&#145;A week in the Wales of the future&#146;, 1957), published by Plaid Cymru, is a polemic in its depiction of, first, a utopian society enjoying full self-government and, secondly, a region known as &#145;West England&#146; in which all traces of Welsh culture have been obliterated by a totalitarian regime. <span class="italic">Blas y cynfyd</span> (&#145;A taste of the old world&#146;, 1958) is a satire on the pettiness and hypocrisy that Elis found all about him in his own country. In <span class="italic">Tabyrddau'r Babongo</span> (&#145;Drums of the Babongo&#146;, 1961) he turned to the colonization of Africa and its implications for other oppressed cultures, and, always ready to bend the genres, in <span class="italic">Y blaned dirion</span> (&#145;The fair planet&#146;, 1968) he wrote the first science fiction in Welsh. He also persevered with his short stories, bringing out a selection under the title <span class="italic">Marwydos</span> (&#145;Embers&#146;, 1974), wrote a play about Howell Harris (leader of the Methodist revival in Wales), made a charming Welsh translation of <span class="italic">Arabian Nights</span>, and published a collection of his highly polished essays and radio talks under the title <span class="italic">Naddion</span> (&#145;Shavings&#146;, 1998). With Gwyn Jones he edited an anthology of Welsh short stories for Oxford University Press in 1971; this included a translation of his story &#145;Song of a Pole&#146;. His Lleifior books were translated by Meic Stephens as <span class="italic">Shadow of the Sickle</span> (1998) and <span class="italic">Return to Lleifior</span> (1999).<br>
<br>A diffident man, who could be prickly towards even his mildest critics, Islwyn Ffowc Elis was nevertheless unperturbed by the view that, in his attempt to create a younger and wider audience for the Welsh novel by making his work more accessible, he had set limits on the literary quality of his writing. He was fond of pointing to the English writer Graham Greene as a writer of &#145;entertainments&#146; that beguiled the reader with their plots and characterization, as he had undoubtedly done in Welsh. For his services to the literature of his country he was awarded the degree of DLitt by the University of Wales in 1993. He died at the West Wales General Hospital, Carmarthen, on 22 January 2004, of bronchopneumonia and heart failure, and his remains were cremated six days later in Aberystwyth. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
