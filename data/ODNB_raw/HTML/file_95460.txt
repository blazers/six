<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barker,  Ronald William George <span class="st"> [Ronnie]</span></span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, was born on 25 September 1929 at 70 Garfield Street, Bedford, the only son and second of the three children of Leonard William Barker, a clerk for Shell, and his wife, Edith Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter. His father's work took the family to Ilford and eventually to Oxford, where Barker attended Donnington junior school and the City of Oxford High School. On leaving school he began to train as an architect but after a few months abandoned his studies and took a job at the local Westminster Bank. A childhood bout of nephritis and surgery for a tubercular gland ensured his rejection for national service.<br>
<br>While working at the bank Barker joined a local amateur dramatics group, where he caught the attention of the director, Margarethe Bayliss, who suggested that he might become a professional actor. His audition for the Young Vic school in London in 1947 was unsuccessful; but in 1948 he auditioned for the Manchester Repertory Company, at that time located in Aylesbury, and was taken on as assistant stage manager. After serving a week's notice at the bank, on 8 November 1948 he entered the hectic world of weekly repertory, and a week later made his professional stage d&eacute;but as Lieutenant Spicer in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Quality Street</span>. He recalled playing mostly &#145;upper-class idiots&#146; but, intoxicated by the sound of an audience's laughter, he realized that his natural instinct was for comic roles: &#145;This is what I want to do, I thought. I want to make people laugh. Never mind Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charley's Aunt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dancing in the Moonlight</span>, 38). He would later commemorate his early stage career, together with his offstage sexual conquests, in a lively memoir.<br>
<br>In time the company left Aylesbury for Rhyl, and Barker went with it; but the company's days were numbered, and Barker soon found himself back home in Oxford. He worked as a hospital porter until, in January 1950, he joined Clifford Williams's touring mime company. After a few weeks of &#145;misery and despair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dancing in the Moonlight</span>, 72) the tour collapsed in Cornwall without even enough money for everyone's train fare, and Barker was left to walk home to Oxford. He then joined Frank H. Fortescue's Famous Players in Bramhall, Cheshire, where he was influenced by Glenn Melvyn, &#145;who was to teach me everything I ever learned about comedy&#146;  (ibid., 80)&#151;including how to stutter. While still in Bramhall, Barker applied to the Oxford Playhouse and was taken on, albeit initially in the publicity department. His young contemporaries included Maggie Smith, whom Barker advised to give up acting. Fortunately she took no notice.<br>
<br>The first major turning point in Barker's career came with the arrival of Peter Hall as the new director of the Oxford Playhouse. He recognized Barker's talent, and when he left Oxford for London to become director of the Arts Theatre he invited Barker to join him for a production of Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">Mourning Becomes Electra</span> (1955). This marked the beginning of Barker's career on the West End stage, which would include a role in Peter Brook's production of <span class="italic">Irma La Douce</span> (1958)&#151;an unhappy experience that left Barker with an aversion to long runs&#151;and perhaps reached its high point when he played two characters in two plays in different theatres on the same evening. On 8 July 1957, at All Saints, Harrow Weald, Barker married Beryl Joyce (Joy) Tubb, a 24-year-old actress, and daughter of George Tubb, painter and decorator. They had two sons, Laurence 
    (Larry; <i>b</i>. 1960)
   and Adam (<i>b</i>. 1967), and a daughter, Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1963).<br>
<br>Barker also began to find work in radio and television. The long-running series <span class="italic">The Navy Lark</span>, in which he played the malcontent Able Seaman Johnson, made him a distinctive radio personality; he stayed with the show for seven years (1959&#150;67). His television career took a decisive turn in 1966 when the BBC producer Jimmy Gilbert proposed that he should join Ronnie Corbett and John Cleese in <span class="italic">The Frost Report</span>, David Frost's new series of themed satirical shows on various aspects of contemporary British society. The series, which would make television stars of all three men, was memorable mainly for its comic visual representation of the British class structure, with Barker standing between the tall Cleese and the diminutive Corbett to speak for the middle class. The show later moved to ITV as <span class="italic">Frost on Sunday</span> (1968&#150;70). <span class="italic">The Frost Report</span> also saw the emergence of Barker as a prolific comedy writer. He began to submit material under assumed names, ostensibly so that his colleagues would judge the material on its own merits. His favourite <i>nom de plume</i> was Gerald Wiley.<br>
<br>In 1968 Barker was given his own show, <span class="italic">The Ronnie Barker Playhouse</span>, a series of six individual comedies. He had gained his first experience of the &#145;playhouse&#146; format, presenting different characters and situations in each episode, when he had appeared with the comedian Jimmy Edwards in <span class="italic">The Seven Faces of Jim</span> (1961) and its two sequels, and such series would prove particularly fruitful in Barker's career: <span class="italic">Hark at Barker</span> (1969, 1970), <span class="italic">Six Dates with Barker</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">Seven of One</span> (1973) would yield characters and ideas that Barker was later able to develop.<br>
<br>Barker enjoyed only a modest film career, making little impact, and came to realize that his future lay in television; but with <span class="italic">Futtock's End</span> (1970), which he wrote himself, he discovered the genre of the &#145;almost silent&#146; film. He made two others, also starring Ronnie Corbett: <span class="italic">The Picnic</span> (1976) and <span class="italic">By the Sea</span> (1982), which reflected Barker's love of seaside postcards. He had become an avid collector of printed ephemera, and in 1974 he published his <span class="italic">Book of Bathing Beauties</span>, the first of several such volumes derived entirely from his own collection.<br>
<br>The next major development in the career of Ronnie Barker&#151;and of Ronnie Corbett&#151;came about by accident. When a live broadcast of an awards ceremony from the London Palladium was interrupted by a technical problem, the two Ronnies gave an impromptu performance to entertain the audience. The BBC's head of light entertainment, Bill Cotton, was so impressed that he suggested that the two men be brought together for their own series. <span class="italic">The Two Ronnies</span> ran from 1971 to 1986. The format never changed. Opening and closing with spoof announcements and news items, each show contained sketches, monologues, a comedy drama serial, and a musical finale, with the sign-off line, &#145;It's goodnight from me&#151;and it's goodnight from him&#146;. The stand-up comedian Corbett delivered his monologues directly to the audience, but Barker the actor was invariably in character, usually a spokesman for some fictitious organization or government department. The serials, all written by Barker, included &#145;The Worm that Turned&#146;, portraying a future Britain ruled by women and with the men wearing women's clothes; &#145;The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town&#146;, elaborating an episode contributed by Spike Milligan to <span class="italic">Six Dates with Barker</span>; and &#145;Death can be Fatal&#146;, featuring the two clueless detectives Piggy Malone (Barker) and Charley Farley (Corbett). The sketches frequently displayed Barker's love of wordplay, most notably in &#145;Four Candles/Fork Handles&#146;, which became an established favourite and which the two Ronnies later performed live (with a new ending) during their season at the Palladium in 1978. In the same year Barker and Corbett were appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Two situation comedies in the 1970s, <span class="italic">Porridge</span> and <span class="italic">Open All Hours</span>, confirmed Barker as the country's foremost comedy actor. <span class="italic">Porridge</span> (1974&#150;7), written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, retrieved Norman Stanley Fletcher, a convicted criminal, from <span class="italic">Seven of One</span>, and captured the tedium of daily prison life and the sweetness of little victories over authority. A feature film with the same title followed in 1979; but <span class="italic">Going Straight</span> (1978), a series tracing Fletcher's life after his release, was less successful. <span class="italic">Open All Hours</span> (1976 and 1981&#150;5) saw the revival of another character from <span class="italic">Seven of One</span>: the stuttering, miserly grocer Arkwright, who exploited the good nature of his downtrodden nephew Granville and lusted after the buxom nurse Gladys Emmanuel. <span class="italic">Open All Hours</span> was written by Roy Clarke, whose next series, <span class="italic">The Magnificent Evans</span> (1984), about a flamboyant Welsh photographer, gave Barker his first real taste of failure. A similar fate would befall <span class="italic">Clarence</span> (1988), his last series, written by Barker himself. Revived from <span class="italic">Six Dates with Barker</span>, Clarence the short-sighted removal man also failed to impress.<br>
<br>In late 1985 Barker decided to retire. He had begun to find writing difficult but had also developed heart disease (he underwent surgery in 1996). He planned his retirement carefully and finally stopped working at the end of 1987, walking away from show business to open an antique shop in Chipping Norton. &#145;I lose money every week, but it's a hobby&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, 23 Dec 2003). Fortunately his retirement was not absolute. In 1988 his daughter, Charlotte, opened at London's King's Head Theatre in <span class="italic">Mum</span>, a play he had written for her. It received a cool reception from the critics. He returned to film acting in <span class="italic">The Gathering Storm</span> (2002), playing Churchill's butler, David Inches, and in <span class="italic">My House in Umbria</span> (2003), in which he was reunited with Maggie Smith. In 2004 he suggested that some <span class="italic">Two Ronnies</span> material might be shown again; and the popularity of <span class="italic">The Two Ronnies Sketchbook</span> (2005), in which Corbett and Barker presented a personal selection, demonstrated that the shows had retained their appeal. Barker was visibly frail, and the Christmas special, recorded in July 2005, marked his final television appearance.<br>
<br>Secure in his own talent&#151;he knew what he could do and knew that he was good at it&#151;Barker was spared the anxieties that haunted the careers of many of his comedy contemporaries. Peter Hall, whose early admiration for Barker had only grown over the years, identified Barker's &#145;gift of total relaxation&#146;, and praised his &#145;immaculate comic timing&#146; and the way in which he &#145;completely inhabited what it was he was being, even if it was a north country charlady&#146;  (McCabe, 36). In the late 1980s Hall invited Barker to play Falstaff at the National Theatre. (In the mid-1960s Barker had appeared on Caedmon recordings of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> as Launcelot Gobbo and <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> as Barnardine. These performances suggest that he could have justified Hall's belief in him.) Barker cited Hall's remarkable offer, or more particularly the summary fashion in which he rejected it, as the immediate cause of his decision to retire; but the truth is that Hall's invitation had simply come too late&#151;failing health and loss of motivation had already made Barker's decision for him. He died of heart disease at Katharine House Hospice, Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on 3 October 2005. He was cremated after a humanist funeral service at Banbury crematorium on 13 October. A service of thanksgiving for his life and work was held at Westminster Abbey on 3 March 2006. He was survived by his wife, Joy, and their children Laurence, Charlotte, and Adam. In a late interview with Terry Wogan, Ronnie Barker had composed his own epitaph: &#145;I suppose I would like to be remembered as one of the funniest men people have seen on TV. &#147;He did make us laugh. God bless him&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 4 March 2006). It was an assessment with which few would have disagreed.<br>
