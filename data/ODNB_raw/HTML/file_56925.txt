<span class="headword">Fisher,  Osmond</span>  (1817&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and geologist</span>, was born at the vicarage, Osmington, Dorset, on 17 November 1817. His father, John Fisher (1788&#150;1832), was archdeacon of Berkshire and canon of Salisbury, but is chiefly remembered as the friend and painting companion of John Constable (1776&#150;1837). His mother, Mary, was the daughter of Canon William Cookson, a dean of Windsor, and was a cousin of the poet William Wordsworth. John Fisher died when Osmond was fifteen, and the boy, who had been a pupil at Eton College in 1828&#150;30, went to live with his uncle, Canon William Fisher, at Poulshot, Wiltshire, where he pursued his scientific interests. The following year he was sent to the newly opened King's College, London. His principal at King's, William Otter (1768&#150;1840), later bishop of Chichester, encouraged him to go to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he entered for the mathematical tripos. He graduated in 1841 as eighteenth wrangler and was elected a fellow in 1844.<br>
<br>In 1845 Fisher was ordained priest and became curate-in-charge of All Saints, Dorchester, where he quickly became involved in the founding of the Dorset County Museum. Here he made several donations of geological material and gave the first public lectures on geology. In 1853 he returned to Jesus College as a tutor.<br>
<br>Fisher's early years at Cambridge produced some important contributions to geological science, including his papers on the Purbeck strata of Dorset  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society</span>, 9, 1856, 555&#150;81) and on the Bracklesham beds of the Isle of Wight basin  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span>, 18, 1862, 65&#150;93). He married Maria Louisa Middleton (1837&#150;1867) in 1857, and was given the college living of Elmstead, near Colchester, which gave him the opportunity to work on many of the Tertiary deposits of East Anglia. In 1867 he was left a widower with five sons to bring up, a few weeks after moving to another college living at Harlton, near Cambridge.<br>
<br>At a time when there was much speculation on the nature of the earth's interior, but no effective geophysical hardware for investigation, Fisher used mathematics in an attempt to provide some answers to the problem. He countered the deduction of William Thomson (1824&#150;1907), later Lord Kelvin, that the earth is completely solid, by showing that a shrunken solid earth would not have the observed range of mountain elevations, research published as &#145;On the formation of mountains viewed in connection with the secular cooling of the earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>, new ser., 2nd decade, 1, 1874, 60&#150;63). His work in this direction culminated in what is certainly the first textbook of geophysics, <span class="italic">Physics of the Earth's Crust</span> (1881). He produced a revised edition in 1889 and an appendix in 1891. His geophysical work continued almost to the end of his long life, with his final paper, &#145;On the rigidity of the earth and on Colonel Burrard's theory of the Himalayas&#146;, being published in the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span> in 1913. Indeed, his work anticipated many of the findings of modern plate tectonics.<br>
<br>Fisher was greatly respected in his lifetime. He received honorary fellowships from King's College, London, in 1882, and from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1892. The Geological Society awarded him the proceeds of the Lyell fund in 1887, the Murchison medal in 1893, and the Wollaston medal in 1913. He resigned his Harlton living in 1906 and went to live with his eldest son, the Revd Osmond P. Fisher, at the rectory in Gravely, near Huntingdon, where he died on 12 July 1914. He was buried beside his wife at Harlton churchyard, Cambridge, on 15 July.<br>
