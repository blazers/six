<span class="headword">&Oacute; h&Eacute;anna,  Muirgheas</span> <span class="st"> [Matthew O'Heney]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1206), <span class="occ">archbishop of Cashel and papal legate for Ireland</span>, was a monk of the Cistercian abbey of Holy Cross, Tipperary. He became archbishop of Cashel before 1186, when, according to Gerald of Wales, he was present at the provincial synod summoned by Archbishop John Cumin to meet in Dublin during Lent; and Gerald attributes to him the famous remark regarding the propensity of the English race for making martyrs. About 1190 &Oacute; h&Eacute;anna wrote two letters to Pope Clement III enquiring about points of canon law and it was this pontiff or his successor Celestine III who appointed the archbishop papal legate for Ireland in 1191&#150;2. The annals of Inisfallen reported that the new legate held a great synod in Dublin in 1192 and Dublin ecclesiastical records testify to the presence in Dublin that year of the legate and other prominent Irish churchmen. During this period &Oacute; h&Eacute;anna negotiated a settlement between the archbishop of Dublin and the Cistercian monks of St Mary's Abbey. He was in England <i>c</i>.1192&#150;3 when John, lord of Ireland, granted a charter in his favour at Ludgershall, Wiltshire. In 1195 he is mentioned as one of the prelates who brought the body of Hugh de Lacy, first lord of Meath, to the abbey of Bective in Meath for re-interment.<br>
<br>Although &Oacute; h&Eacute;anna's appointment as papal legate lapsed in 1198, he is described as legate by the annals of Inisfallen when in 1201 he acted as peace broker in Munster between the local Irish and William de Burgh. He incurred the displeasure of Pope Innocent III both for his refusal to consecrate a new bishop for Ardfert and for his involvement in the dispute between Archbishop John Cumin of Dublin and King John. &Oacute; h&Eacute;anna apparently administered the Dublin spiritualities while Cumin was in exile. These offences resulted in his suspension by Innocent III's new legate in Ireland, Cardinal John of Salerno. It was reported to the pope in 1202 that because of his advanced age &Oacute; h&Eacute;anna could not come to seek the pope's absolution in person. It is not known when the suspension was lifted but by 1205 he was functioning again as archbishop. He died in Holy Cross Abbey in 1206 and was buried there. His obit in the annals of Ireland states that he was an able and religious man, the founder of many churches and religious beyond his fellow countrymen.<br>
