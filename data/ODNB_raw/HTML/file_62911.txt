<span class="headword">Morgan,  Griffith</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Guto Nyth-br&acirc;n]</span>  (1700&#150;1737), <span class="occ">long-distance runner</span>, was a celebrated athlete of phenomenal speed and stamina. Guto is the Welsh diminutive of Griffith, and Nyth-br&acirc;n (&#145;crow's nest&#146;) was the name of the farm where he lived, in the parish of Llanwynno, in the Glamorgan hills between Porth and Mountain Ash. Nothing is known of his upbringing beyond the fact that his parents moved to Nyth-br&acirc;n Farm from his birthplace in neighbouring Llwyncelyn when he was little more than a year old.<br>
<br>Foot-racing and pedestrian contests, like prize-fighting and wrestling matches, were regular features of pre-industrial sporting life; arranged locally by publicans or local shopkeepers in the absence of more professional promoters, they were invariably an outlet for gambling and the expression of parochial pride. Little celebrated in his own day, Guto's remarkable feats were revived for posterity by the Revd William Thomas 
    (Glanffrwd; 1843&#150;1890)
  , whose history of the parish of Llanwynno appeared in 1888 at a time of emerging Welsh national consciousness. Guto, it appears, was a fleet-footed, multi-terrain specialist who could round up sheep without the help of a dog, chase hares until they were reduced to exhaustion, and outrun horses. His mother once sent him on an errand to Aberd&acirc;r, more than 3 miles away, and was amazed to find he had completed the 7 mile round trip before the kettle had boiled. Only a cynic would query the capacity of the kettle or the intensity of the flames which heated it.<br>
<br>Capable of covering 50 yards in four seconds and 10 miles in forty-five minutes, this Welsh Olympian attracted backers whose wagers were taken by the formidable Si&acirc;n o'r Siop (&#145;Jane of the shop&#146;), a local admirer who became Guto's lover as well as his manager. Having seen off numerous opponents from near and far, in 1737 Guto, despite not having run competitively for four years, accepted the challenge of an Englishman, Prince, to a 12 mile race from Newport to Bedwas church, near Caerphilly, for a large money prize. Si&acirc;n wagered a thousand sovereigns, and the life savings of every resident in the parish of Llanwynno were said to have been placed on Guto. The race took place on 6 September, and after adopting his usual malodorous pre-match practice of sleeping in warm manure, as much to deter any opponent from getting too close to him as to loosen his limbs&#151;which according to Glanffrwd were &#145;like whipcord and as flexible as whalebones&#146;  (Glanffrwd, 92)&#151;Guto felt confident enough during the race to chat with spectators along the route, thereby enabling Prince to open up a large gap. Guto eventually overhauled him, ran alongside for a short while dispensing advice and then, with fine but foolhardy bravado, sprinted up the steep mile-long gradient to the church to win in the astounding time of fifty-three minutes. An ecstatic Si&acirc;n collected two full aprons of winnings and thumped the back of her triumphant but exhausted champion, who promptly fell dead at her feet.<br>
<br>Guto was buried in St Gwynno's churchyard, Llanwynno, on 18 September 1737. His original gravestone still lies under the south wall of the churchyard, while another was erected in 1866, bearing two verses in Welsh, one of them by Glanffrwd, whose subsequent history of the parish did most to revive the reputation of this remarkable athlete.<br>
