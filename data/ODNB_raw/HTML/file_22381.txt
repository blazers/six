<span class="headword">Plessington <span class="st"> [Plesyngton]</span>, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1393), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was born into a family of minor Lancashire freeholders, presumably named from Pleasington in that county. He was married in 1369, but his wife died before 6 February 1380, when he was married to Agnes (surname unknown), who survived him. From November 1376 he was a keeper of the peace in the West Riding of Yorkshire (later in the East Riding also), while during the 1370s he was also attorney of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, in the royal exchequer, until in November 1377 he was appointed chief baron of the exchequer for the duchy of Lancaster. By 19 March 1380 he was the duke's steward in Lancashire, and a justice at Lancaster. In 1374 Gaunt had leased to him the lordship of Staincliffe in the West Riding for twenty years. On 6 December 1380 he was appointed chief baron of the king's exchequer, and before 8 December 1382 he had relinquished all his Lancastrian offices. Plessington left office under something of a cloud, charged with the erasure and embezzlement of records, but on 1 May 1383 he received a ducal pardon for any offences committed in office, and in the parliament of October 1383 the king publicly ratified, at its beneficiary's request, the general pardon which he had earlier granted to Plessington. The latter had long profited from ducal service&#151;on 20 October 1375 he could afford to lend Hugh, Lord Dacre, 1100 marks (&pound;733 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.).<br>
<br>By 16 November 1383 Plessington, who had been knighted by July 1382, had found a new patron, for he had become chief steward of Thomas (I) Mowbray, earl of Nottingham, a rising star at court who was to be among Gaunt's opponents. On 7 July 1384, at Mowbray's supplication, Plessington was granted the stewardship of Richmondshire. However, Mowbray's influence at court failed Plessington in a case where the king's chief favourite, Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1392), was concerned: the latter prevented Plessington from occupying the stewardship of Kendal, Westmorland, granted him by the crown in 1382. During the parliament of 1386, before 5 November, Plessington was dismissed from his post as chief baron of the exchequer. A schedule of charges was drawn up against him alleging misconduct in office, though the offences named were relatively trivial. Clearly he had angered the king, perhaps by siding with the critics of royal policy in the parliament of 1386. In November 1387 Plessington compounded his offences in Richard's eyes by reading publicly in the king's presence in Westminster Hall the charges against the royal favourites made by the lords appellant (who included the earl of Nottingham); moreover, he acted as their spokesman in the Merciless Parliament of 1388.<br>
<br>Despite, or perhaps because of, the uniquely high profile of Plessington's services to the appellants, the latter did not procure his restoration to royal office. Instead, their leader, the king's uncle Thomas, duke of Gloucester, became his appreciative patron. He was a member of Gloucester's council on 2 November 1391, and his chief councillor on 14 February 1392; Plessington had also become a ducal steward by the time of his death, on 27 July 1393. He purchased a great deal of property, especially in his native Lancashire&#151;Pleasington Manor, part of Ellal and lands in Lancaster, Comberhall, Kirkham, and Penwortham. In 1381/2 he bought Healaugh Manor and an estate in Swaledale, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The purchase of Burley, Rutland, in 1383 gave his family a landed stake in southern English society. He also acquired tenements in Holborn, Middlesex. In the parliament of 1397/8 Plessington was posthumously accused of having aided Gloucester in his treasons of ten years earlier; in March 1398 he was declared to have been a traitor, and his son and heir, Robert (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1369), was forfeited. The judgment was reversed in Henry IV's first parliament, in 1399.<br>
