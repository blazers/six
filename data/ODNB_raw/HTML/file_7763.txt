</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dodwell,  Henry</span>  (1641&#150;1711), <span class="occ">scholar and theologian</span>, was born in late October 1641 in the parish of St Warburgh, Dublin, the only surviving son of William Dodwell (<i>d</i>. 1650), army officer, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1651), daughter of Sir Francis Slingsby of Yorkshire. Dodwell was born a few days after the Irish rising of 1641 broke out. He spent his early years with his mother in Dublin while his father's estate in Connaught was possessed by the rebels. In 1648 the family left for London and thence to York where their relatives lived. Dodwell spent five years at the &#145;Free School in the Horsefair&#146; (St Peter's School), where Christopher Wallis was his teacher. In 1650 his father died of the plague at Waterford on his way back to his estate. His mother died of consumption soon after, and Dodwell was left an orphan. He spent about a year in his uncle Henry Dodwell's house in Suffolk before continuing his education in Ireland. In 1656 he was admitted a pensioner to Trinity College, Dublin, where the eminent physician and scholar John Stearne was his tutor. Dodwell obtained a fellowship in 1662, when a bachelor of arts, and proceeded MA in 1663. He resigned the fellowship in 1666 because he did not wish to take orders when this was required by the statutes of the college. Though he always revered the priesthood, he felt personally insecure about ordination and more confident about serving the church as a lay scholar.<h2>
<a name="Earlyscholarship"></a>Early scholarship</h2>From his days of study under Stearne, whom he admired as a philosophical thinker and a theologian, Dodwell developed a strong interest in philology, classical, biblical, and patristic history, and especially chronology. In his view these were the disciplines with which to acquire knowledge useful to the church of his own day. After Stearne's death in 1669 Dodwell as his literary executor published <span class="italic">De obstinatione</span> (1672), together with a preface of his own. That same year saw the publication of <span class="italic">Two Letters of Advice</span>, a work which among other things emphasized the importance of historical and philological studies for students of divinity. The following year, he published anonymously <span class="italic">Introduction to a Devout Life</span>, an edition of St Francis of Sales's work adapted for protestant use. Dodwell had paid brief visits to England to study in the libraries but finally moved to London in 1674 in pursuit of learning and of contacts with English scholars. In 1675 he went to live and work with William Lloyd, then dean of Bangor, and from 1680 bishop of St Asaph. Lloyd had a reputation as a chronologist and asked Dodwell to join him in his studies. Dodwell accompanied Lloyd on his journeys in these years, and began publishing his own controversial works against Catholicism and nonconformity, for example his <span class="italic">A reply to Mr [Richard] Baxter's pretended confutation of &hellip; Separation of churches from episcopal government &hellip; proved schismatical</span> (1681). Tensions developed between the men because of the 1688 revolution, Lloyd being a latitudinarian whig and Dodwell a high-church tory. Nevertheless, their literary and personal friendship survived these differences.<br>
<br>In the early 1680s Dodwell's ambition to defend the Restoration church and episcopacy also led to a number of scholarly publications. At Oxford, which he visited regularly during this period, Dodwell found a congenial conservative climate and important patristic scholars who enlisted his help, such as John Fell, dean of Christ Church and bishop of Oxford, John Pearson, bishop of Chester, and Edward Bernard. Dodwell wrote <span class="italic">Dissertationes Cyprianicae</span> (1682) at Fell's request. The work was also bound with copies of Fell's famous edition of St Cyprian that came out the same year. The several works of this patristic revival argued the close relationship between the church of primitive Christianity and the Anglican episcopal church. After Pearson's death (1686), Dodwell published his friend's posthumous works together with several essays of his own in 1688.<br>
<br>All this time Dodwell held no university position, but his reputation for learning was growing. He was known to frequent the coffee houses in London and Oxford where he engaged in lively and learned debates on the religious and political issues of his time. With the support of William Lloyd, the biblical scholar John Mill and others at Oxford, Dodwell was elected to the Camden chair of history on 2 April 1688. He was incorporated MA at Hart Hall on 21 May and on 25 May gave a successful inaugural lecture on ancient chronology. This was followed by six lectures on the <span class="italic">Historia Augusta</span>, and a further series of sixteen on Hadrian, until 6 November 1691. Altogether nineteen lectures were published in 1692 as <span class="italic">Praelectiones academicae in schola rhetorices Camdeniana</span>, with which Dodwell impressed his contemporaries as a sophisticated humanist scholar.<h2>
<a name="Nonjuror"></a>Nonjuror</h2>Dodwell's public career, however, was not to last much beyond the revolution of 1688. He published anonymously his <span class="italic">Concerning the Case of Taking the New Oath of Fealty and Allegiance</span> in 1689, himself intending to refuse to take the oath to William and Mary. It was argued at the time that refusing the oath might not endanger his praelectorship, but as Dodwell wrote to Arthur Charlett on 11 March 1690, &#145;If I may not keep my place without Sin or Scandal, I desire not to keep it at all&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ballard 34, fols. 2&#150;10). When his lectures had been stopped, Dodwell felt he was being forced to resign by the institution of the new oath. Therefore, he made sure to receive a certificate from the vice-chancellor of the university stating that his dismissal was on the grounds of nonjuring. This certificate, dated 19 November 1691, confirmed to Dodwell and his nonjuring friends that he had not resigned voluntarily.<br>
<br>Dodwell developed his theology to justify the separation, becoming one of the first leaders of the nonjuring movement. <span class="italic">A Cautionary Discourse of Schism</span> (1691) after the suspension of the bishops was soon followed by <span class="italic">A vindication of the deprived bishops, asserting their spiritual rights against a lay-deprivation</span> (1692). This work answered Humphrey Hody's <span class="italic">Anglicani novi schismatis</span>, published in English as <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of a Separation from the New Bishops</span> (1691). Both Hody and Dodwell argued their cases by examining historical precedents. Hody presented an ancient Greek manuscript in the Bodleian  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Baroccian 142), but Dodwell proved Hody's scholarship flawed. In order to defend the deprivation of the nonjuring bishops, Hody had repressed part of the manuscript which contained canons requiring a synod to validate a deprivation. Dodwell's point that the new bishops were schismatical was based on the writings of St Cyprian. In Dodwell's patristic theology the secular ruler could not replace bishops who had been canonically appointed. The church was envisioned as a divine society with independent jurisdiction in spiritual matters, separate from the state and its temporal affairs. Dodwell's fight against Erastianism in these and following publications considerably influenced the high-church Anglicanism of his time.<h2>
<a name="Domesticandscholarlycircle"></a>Domestic and scholarly circle</h2>After his deprivation in 1691 Dodwell wished to live in retirement and moved to Cookham, a village in Berkshire. He came to know Francis Cherry, a Jacobite squire from nearby Shottesbrooke, and the two met regularly in a Maidenhead coffee house, discussing religion and politics. Becoming close friends, Cherry desired Dodwell to move closer to a manor house he owned in White Waltham. On 29 June 1694 Dodwell married Anne Elliot (<i>d</i>. 1750), the daughter of his landlord from Cookham. Upon their marriage Dodwell and his wife moved to Shottesbrooke where Cherry fitted them up with a house. They had ten children, of whom two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7764/', "Henry Dodwell (1706&#150;1784)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7765/', "William Dodwell (1709&#150;1785)")</script>, and four daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Shottesbrooke developed into an important centre for nonjurors and scholars, with regular visitors such as Thomas Ken, Charles Leslie, Robert Nelson, George Hickes, Edmund Gibson, and White Kennett. Francis Brokesby functioned as nonjuror family chaplain and was to become Dodwell's biographer. Cherry had taken the promising student Thomas Hearne into his house and Dodwell introduced the boy to the discipline of classical philology. While pursuing his own career as Oxford antiquary a decade later, a grateful and admiring Hearne filled his diaries with detailed biographical information about Dodwell. Shottesbrooke was also visited by scholars from abroad. Dodwell came to know a group of German scholars, among them Gottlieb Schelwig, C. M. Pfaff, and J. C. Wolf, who visited Oxford to work in the Bodleian Library and afterwards kept up a correspondence with Dodwell and Hearne.<h2>
<a name="ReturntotheChurchofEngland"></a>Return to the Church of England</h2>Dodwell continued to defend the Church of England and episcopacy in scholarly and theological writings, but he could not be happy with the schism as a permanent situation in the church. As early as 1700, and unknown to the nonjuror bishops, he tried unsuccessfully to come to an understanding with Archbishop Tenison. Dodwell foresaw another opportunity to heal the breach when, eventually, all deprived nonjuror bishops would have either died or relinquished their sees. In his view, the schism could not be maintained once the situation of two bishops to one see or &#145;altar against altar&#146; no longer existed, even though the deprivations had been invalid. Dodwell explained his position in <span class="italic">A case in view considered &hellip; proving that (in case our present invalidly deprived fathers shall leave all their sees vacant, either by death or resignation) we shall not then be obliged to keep up our separation from those bishops, who are as yet involved in the guilt of the present unhappy schism</span> (1705). The Anglican doctrines of non-resistance and passive obedience were to be heeded, despite remaining irreconcilable differences concerning liturgy and prayers. In January 1710, when Bishop Lloyd of Norwich died and Thomas Ken, the last surviving deprived bishop, ceded his claim to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, Dodwell and the Shottesbrooke group returned to the Church of England. <span class="italic">The Case in View now in Fact</span> (1711) confirmed the end of the schism. Other nonjurors followed, though it is not known how many.<br>
<br>Dodwell's leadership of the nonjurors, however, was no longer undisputed by this time. His tendency to present himself as the champion of Anglican religion provoked bad feelings and jealousies. Increasingly, friends had come to criticize his scholarship and theological speculations. Some, like fellow nonjuror Henry Gandy in <span class="italic">A Conference between Gerontius and Junius</span> (1711), argued that Dodwell's ideas about ending the schism were inconsistent with his earlier writings. Gandy and others were especially baffled by his ideas about the mortality of the soul in <span class="italic">An epistolary discourse, proving, from the scriptures and the first fathers, that the soul is a principle naturally mortal</span> (1706). Immortality, Dodwell maintained, was a gift of God through baptism by episcopally ordained clergy only. Though published in times of heated party debates about the constitution of the church, some of Dodwell's friends considered that his theological speculations were damaging their cause. During the next three years, attacks in sermon and pamphlet, including Edmund Chishull's charge of heresy, left Dodwell a bitter man.<br>
<br>Nonjurors such as George Hickes, Thomas Wagstaffe, Henry Gandy, Thomas Smith, and even Thomas Hearne among others, though supporting Dodwell's arguments against nonconformity, did not follow him in his return to the church. In fact the first two nonjuror bishops (Hickes and Wagstaffe) had been newly consecrated in secret in 1694 in order to maintain the schism. The remaining group of nonjurors led by Hickes saw no reason to end the separation on the basis of Dodwell's Cyprianic principles. With Hickes the nonjurors developed into a sect outside the Church of England, though still claiming to represent the remnant of the only true Catholic church.<h2>
<a name="Laterscholarship"></a>Later scholarship</h2>Dodwell wished his scholarship to serve the causes of the established church. Nevertheless, his vast output of philological and historical studies remains valuable regardless of their possible application to the religious or political issues of his day. His great passion was the study of chronology and historiography of the ancient world. He produced numerous series of treatises on classical authors such as Lactantius, Irenaeus, Cicero, Thucydides, Xenophon, Velleius Paterculus, Quintilian, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Some were published in the classical editions of other scholars. For Bodley's librarian John Hudson, for example, Dodwell wrote introductions to the Greek geographers (published in four volumes 1698&#150;1712) and he advised Hearne on his editions of Livy and Eutropius. Dodwell's first truly antiquarian publication was <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Sanchoniathon's Phoenician History</span> (1681), which showed his independent critical spirit and approach in proving the then much cited work a forgery. Dodwell was involved in the scholarly debates of the eighteenth-century &#145;Battle of the books&#146; between the ancients and the moderns. He contributed &#145;An invitation to gentlemen to acquaint themselves with ancient history&#146; to a new edition of Degory Wheare's <span class="italic">Method and Order of Reading &hellip; Histories</span> (1694), and corresponded with Richard Bentley and William Lloyd about the epistles of Phalaris, trying to defend them as authentic historical documents. However, in his rather delayed publication of <span class="italic">Exercitationes duae</span> (1704), the two dissertations on the age of Phalaris and Pythagoras, Dodwell had to content himself with the discussion of minor chronological problems, tacitly granting Bentley's main point on the forgery.<br>
<br>Dodwell's great chronological study and life's work was <span class="italic">De veteribus Graecorum Romanorumque cyclis</span> (1701), an impressive and well-received study of all the chronological systems of the classical world. An abridged version was published by Edmond Halley and reprinted in Brokesby's <span class="italic">Life of Dodwell</span>. Other antiquarian studies, especially those on recently unearthed ancient objects, were undertaken by Dodwell when such antiquary friends as William Musgrave, Thomas Hearne, and John Woodward aroused his enthusiasm for the chronological problems involved. Thus Dodwell worked on the dating of a Latin inscription for a study of Roman Britain, <span class="italic">Julii Vitalis epitaphium</span> (1711), and on the interpretation of a relief representing the sacking of Rome on a supposedly genuine Roman shield in Woodward's possession. Woodward's shield caused a stir in the international scholarly world. Dodwell's learned and minutely detailed contribution was left unfinished at his death but published by Hearne as <span class="italic">Henrici Dodwelli de parma equestri Woodwardiana dissertatio</span> (1713).<br>
<br>As a scholar Dodwell was renowned for his erudition, piety, and integrity, both at home and abroad. Dodwell corresponded with important foreign scholars such as J. G. Graevius, Antonio Magliabecchi, Cardinal Noris, and Jacob Perizonius, and his works were given respectful attention in English and continental journals. He was also criticized for his obscure and digressive style, something he felt insecure about himself. Brokesby ascribed Dodwell's obscurity to his not being among people enough to know how to communicate his learning. The less charitable opinions of contemporaries such as the bishops Burnet, Kennett, and Nicolson were often coloured by political and religious prejudice. Later in the century, Edward Gibbon appreciated Dodwell's erudition but was also critical: the &#145;worst of this author is his method and style, the one perplexed beyond imagination, the other negligent to a degree of barbarism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gibbon's Journal</span>, 82). Dodwell indeed presents the modern reader with intricate and at times unintelligible arguments, and scholars today agree that his conclusions were not always right (and often could not be, considering the complexity of the problems). Yet his work contains a variety and an abundance of historical detail and original observations about events in classical history. Most important was his effort, through elaborate chronological studies, to recover and reconstruct the ancient past and its historical sources. According to Joseph Levine,<blockquote>Dodwell's criticism, like that of the best of his contemporaries, had advanced beyond the possibilities of Renaissance philology. Scholars of 1700 were no longer content to discover and to expose legend and forgery; they had begun the task of reconstruction as well. (Levine, <span class="italic">Woodward's Shield</span>, 210)</blockquote>Dodwell struggled with deteriorating eyesight in the last years of his life. He died of a consumption on 7 June 1711 after a brief period of illness. He was buried on 9 June in the chancel of his parish church at Shottesbrooke in Berkshire.<br>
