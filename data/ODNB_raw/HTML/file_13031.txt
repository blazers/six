<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry</span>, first Baron Herbert of Cherbury  (1654&#150;1709), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 July 1654 at the house of his uncle George Evelyn (brother of the diarist John Evelyn) in King Street, Covent Garden, London. He was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13029/', "Sir Henry Herbert (bap. 1594, d. 1673)")</script>, politician and royal household official, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1698), daughter of Sir Robert Offley of Dalby, Leicestershire. He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1670, at the Inner Temple in 1671 and Lincoln's Inn in 1672. On 12 February 1678 he married Anne (<i>c</i>.1661&#150;1716), daughter of the London alderman John Ramsey, who brought him a dowry of &pound;8000. In addition to inheriting estates at Ribbesford, Worcestershire, and Dowles (then in Shropshire) from his father, Herbert maintained a residence at Leicester Fields, in Soho, London.<br>
<br>Obeying his father's dying wish Herbert contested the parliamentary seat for the borough of Bewdley, Worcestershire, left vacant by his father's death in April 1673, but lost the vote to Thomas Foley, the Stourbridge ironmaster. The defeat may well have reflected local resentment at an inexperienced nineteen-year-old presuming to sit in parliament as a matter of inheritance. He successfully petitioned parliament in March 1676 to have the result overturned, complaining that &#145;exceptions were taken to most of Mr. Foley's electors, but the Deputy Recorder being Mr. Foley's friend admitted them anyway&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Case of Henry Herbert</span>). Curiously, and despite the warnings from his London agent that &#145;some will make no good construction of your absence&#146;  (Warner, <span class="italic">Epistolary Curiousities, Series the First</span>, 112), he avoided attending parliament in October and November 1678 during the time that Titus Oates was &#145;revealing&#146; the Popish Plot. Herbert was defeated by Philip Foley, Thomas's son, in the first general election of 1679 but obtained a seat for the city of Worcester in the third Exclusion Parliament of 1681. Later that year he sat on the Middlesex grand jury which indicted the earl of Danby for complicity in the Popish Plot.<br>
<br>Herbert's differences with his political rivals at Bewdley seem at first to have been personal rather than ideological, but later took on the contours of a whig&#150;tory struggle. Salwey Winnington, the heir to the Foley interest in Bewdley, became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Robert Harley. Herbert, meanwhile, developed into a staunch whig whose &#145;actions and opinions&#146;, as his son put it, &#145;have always showed against passive obedience&#146;  (Warner, <span class="italic">Epistolary Curiousities, Series the Second</span>, 36). He participated actively in the revolution of 1688, going over to the Netherlands and returning with William's invasion force, and being appointed one of William's commissioners for managing the revenues while in Exeter. He was elected to the Convention and then again to parliament in 1690. As a member of the House of Commons and, after 1694, the House of Lords, Herbert rarely spoke but served as teller many times and chaired numerous committees, showing a particular interest in matters of naval preparedness and the prevention of commercial fraud.<br>
<br>On constitutional matters Herbert was sufficiently committed to English liberties to support the <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span> with the pithy declaration, &#145;I would rather have a standing army than a standing parliament&#146;  (Grey, 10.301). On the other hand he obstructed &#145;country&#146; efforts to extract from the king a more explicit promise to respect the constitution after his veto of the place bill in 1694  (Grey, 10.384). He further expressed his loyalty to the crown in an address of 11 October 1701 from the county of Worcester declaring that &#145;if their representatives do not comply with his [William's] just desires they will upon calling a new parliament elect such as shall&#146;  (Luttrell, 5.99). His unwavering support of William's government was the subject of an impassioned letter to Lord Chancellor Somers in 1700, wherein he described himself as having &#145;continued in the same warmth for this government as I brought over at the P[rince] of O[range's] landing, without any personal profit&#146;  (Warner, <span class="italic">Epistolary Curiousities, Series the Second</span>, 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>None the less Herbert felt his services were under appreciated; as he told William in 1691, &#145;I fear I've labored under some misrepresentations to your majesty&#146;  (Warner, <span class="italic">Epistolary Curiousities, Series the First</span>, 147). The letter to Somers was in fact a plea &#145;if Lord Montagu lays down the treasury to recommend me there&#146;, and Herbert made many such requests for office during the reigns of William and Anne. Although he was created Baron Herbert of Cherbury in 1694 (the title having fallen vacant upon the death of his cousin the fourth Baron Herbert of Cherbury in 1691), Herbert's place seeking was generally unsuccessful. Only in 1707 was he made one of the commissioners of trade and plantations. The post carried a salary of &pound;1000 per annum and was desirable enough that Sidney Godolphin told the duke of Marlborough at Herbert's death, &#145;I could send you a list, I dare say, of about fifty people that have asked for the vacancy in the council of Trade&#146;  (Snyder, 3.1212).<br>
<br>Despite his commitment to preserving the revolution of 1688 Herbert's career exemplifies the less democratic aspects of unreformed politics. He is best remembered for his cynical attempts to control Bewdley's parliamentary representation by manipulating the composition of its tiny electorate. Having complained in his petition of 1676 that Bewdley had too many voters, he complained to parliament in 1679 (after losing to Philip Foley) that Bewdley had too few; his about face had little to do with a newfound commitment to wider suffrage but to the hope of drowning out Foley's majority by the addition of new voters. In 1699 Herbert initiated a legal campaign to invalidate the charter that Bewdley had been given during Charles II's 1684&#150;5 <i>quo warranto</i> campaign and (most controversially) to allow the crown to choose a new corporation (rather than recognize the tory dominated body already sitting). Herbert's efforts harnessed popular resentment of a narrow oligarchy, but also (as tory critics loudly made plain) represented an outrageous instance of ministerial tyranny, giving the crown in effect the right to pick an MP. Herbert won the fight in 1707, when Bewdley was given a new charter and in an election the same year the new corporation duly elected Herbert's son, <a href="#cosubject_13032">Henry Herbert [<i>see below</i>]</a>; in 1710, however, that result was invalidated by a now tory dominated parliament. By that time Herbert was dead, having succumbed to a fever on 22 January 1709. He was buried on 25 January at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden. His wife survived him and died on 24 April 1716.<br>
<br>Herbert's only child, <a name="cosubject_13032"></a><span class="headword">Henry Herbert</span>, second Baron Herbert of Cherbury  (<em>d.</em> 1738), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was educated at Westminster School in 1696 by Thomas Knipe, who was unimpressed by his &#145;insufferable negligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Westminsters</span>, 1.449). He was tutored by Abel Boyer in 1699, who also found him an unwilling student. In 1705 Herbert stood unsuccessfully for his father's seat at Bewdley but was returned at a by-election in May 1707, being again defeated at the 1708 elections. Having succeeded his father as Lord Herbert in January 1709, on 12 December 1709 Herbert married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1770), daughter of John Wallop of Farley, Southampton, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28582/', "John Wallop, first earl of Portsmouth")</script>. They had no children. Herbert followed his father's whig politics, but was not appointed to any government office. He died, his debts greatly increased, at Ribbesford on 19 April 1738, possibly by suicide. His main property at Ribbesford was inherited by a cousin, Henry Morley. His widow became lady of the bedchamber to Princess Anne, daughter of George II, and died on 19 October 1770.<br>
