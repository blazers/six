<span class="headword">Orme,  Stanley <span class="st"> [Stan]</span></span>, Baron Orme  (1923&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 5 April 1923 at Sale Memorial Hospital, Sale, Cheshire, the son of Sherwood Orme, corn miller's bookkeeper, and later clerk at a cotton mill, and his wife, Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drew. He was brought up in difficult financial circumstances. He left elementary school at fourteen, and worked as an instrument maker's apprentice at the Metropolitan&#150;Vickers plant in Trafford Park industrial estate. In 1942 he enlisted in RAF Bomber Command as a warrant officer and navigator. His fellow airmen had a great regard for his skill as a Pathfinder navigator, and his sheer courage as an aircrew leader. Throughout his life he felt that in view of the number of sorties that he undertook, and his repeated postings, he was lucky to be alive, and to have survived the war.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1947, Orme returned to the Metropolitan&#150;Vickers factory at Trafford Park. Having joined the Labour Party in 1944, he worked hard to improve his education in classes at the National Council of Labour Colleges and in night classes organized by the Workers' Educational Association. He became a powerful convener of shop stewards for the Amalgamated Engineering Union (working closely with Hugh Scanlon) and sat on Sale borough council from 1958 to 1965. On 20 January 1951 he married Irene Mary Harris, a 27-year-old solicitor's clerk, of Sale, and daughter of Vernon Fletcher Harris, musician. It was a close marriage, but there were no children.<br>
<br>Orme was disappointed to be defeated in his attempt to win Stockport South in the 1959 general election. He won Salford West in 1964, and worked closely with a political soul-mate, the Labour MP for Salford East, Frank Allaun. His maiden speech, devoted to industrial issues from the point of view of a skilled engineer, instantly identified him as a politician to watch. As a back-bencher he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized Harold Wilson's refusal to condemn America over the Vietnam war and his dithering over Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence in Rhodesia, and opposed Barbara Castle's white paper <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span> of 1969. He was firmly identified with the Labour left and occasionally made a great deal of trouble for the government, but most ministers realized that he never made trouble for the sake of it: he was far too intense and serious about his politics and the interests of working-class people.<br>
<br>Increasingly concerned by the civil rights situation and then the outbreak of the &#145;troubles&#146; in Northern Ireland, Orme was made a junior spokesman on the province by Wilson in 1972. Along with Jock Stallard and Kevin McNamara, he organized the vote against internment in the Commons. However, when he became minister of state for Northern Ireland following the first general election of 1974, under Merlyn Rees, he started by signing detention orders, which caused a breakdown in relations with some of his former allies without fully endearing him to the Unionist leadership. He subsequently felt humiliated by the protestant working class spurning the attempts by the general secretary of the TUC, Len Murray, and others to reach a compromise. He was loyal to Rees, but perhaps misread the situation. Nevertheless he did do a considerable amount of good work at the Northern Ireland Office, in particular by piloting through a bill outlawing religious discrimination in employment, and by arranging subsidies to keep the great shipyard of Harland and Wolff in existence.<br>
<br>Orme was no doubt thankful to wash his hands of Northern Ireland and move on to being minister of state at the Department of Health and Social Security in April 1976, in Jim Callaghan's government. Five months later he was promoted to be minister for social security and a member of the cabinet, but his time in that post was again unhappy, given the need for tight curbs on government expenditure. Following Labour's defeat in the 1979 election he served successively as opposition spokesman on health and social services (1979&#150;80), industry (1980&#150;83), and finally energy (1983&#150;7). He held the latter post through the miners' strike of 1984&#150;5, when he publicly supported but privately criticized the intransigent leader of the miners, Arthur Scargill, and then through the subsequent decimation of the British coal industry and the privatization of the gas industry. Complex, deep-thinking, more than a little secretive, often suspicious of his colleagues, prone to respond to questions by posing another question in reply, he was a fair-minded if sometimes irascible chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, basically loyal to but not uncritical of Neil Kinnock, from 1987 until 1992.<br>
<br>Orme, who had held Salford West until the 1983 election, and Salford East thereafter, retired from the House of Commons at the 1997 election, and was immediately made a life peer, as Baron Orme, of Salford. A keen and lifelong supporter of Manchester United Football Club and of the Lancashire cricket team, he lived his final years in Northwood Grove, Sale. He died on 28 April 2005 at Trafford General Hospital, Davyhulme, following a stroke, and was survived by his wife, Irene.<br>
