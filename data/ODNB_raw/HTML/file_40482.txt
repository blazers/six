<span class="headword">Taylor,  Cecil Philip</span>  (1929&#150;1981), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 6 November 1929 at 10 Burnbank Terrace, Glasgow, the only son of Max Taylor (<i>b</i>. 20 March 1898), a commercial traveller, and Fay, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leventhal (<i>b</i>. 1901). Both parents were Jewish and born in Russia. Max, who was born Max Girschovitz, became a naturalized British citizen in February 1920. Cecil Taylor left Queen's Park secondary school, Glasgow, in 1943 at the age of fourteen and had no other formal education. He began a succession of jobs, including electrician, television engineer, and record salesman, while writing stories and poems in his spare time. In 1954 he won a prize from the Jewish Congress for his play <span class="italic">Mister David</span>, which eventually received its premi&egrave;re production at the Jewish State Theatre, Warsaw, thirteen years later. On 8 March 1956 C. P. Taylor, as he was known professionally, married his first wife, Irene Rebecca Diamond (<i>b</i>. 30 April 1931), with whom he had two children, Avram and Clare. In 1957 he left Glasgow for Northumberland, where he lived for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1962 Taylor's first professional production, <span class="italic">Aa Went to Blaydon Races</span>, was staged in Newcastle upon Tyne. He started his long association with the newly formed Traverse Theatre Club in Edinburgh in 1965 with <span class="italic">Happy Days are Here Again</span>, which played to packed houses. At this time Taylor met Elizabeth Anne Screen (<i>b</i>. 6 Dec 1945), with whom he lived from 1966 and had two children, David and Cathryn. His divorce from Irene was achieved in February 1973 and he married Liz on 9 April 1973.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Taylor had become, and was to remain until the end of his life, among the most prolific dramatists of his, or any other, generation. He battered out an extraordinary profusion of scripts for stage and television, and for amateur and professional performance, on a series of manual typewriters in a wooden shed in his garden. Since there is no precise audit of his lifetime's work, it is difficult to put a final figure on the number of plays he wrote. His conviction that playwrights should contribute usefully to the community in which they lived compelled him to write prolifically for youth theatres, especially the Northumberland Experimental Youth Theatre at Backworth Drama Centre, and for schools, including Northgate special school, near Morpeth, where he worked regularly with disabled children. At the same time Taylor was literary adviser to the Tyneside Theatre Company in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Liverpool Everyman Theatre. He was also a willing mentor to every aspiring playwright who sought his support and advice, and was a founding member of both the Scottish Society of Playwrights and the Northern Playwrights' Society.<br>
<br>Taylor's small Northumberland homes, first at Capheaton and later in Longhorsley, were always full of children and animals (he was an enthusiastic naturalist) and marked by the sound of the constantly ringing telephone. In the relative peace of his garden shed he worked at white heat, knowing that he would edit or discard most of what he wrote. At a time before word processing, he would always reckon to produce at least ten drafts of every play. While producing scripts did not seem to be a problem to him, shaping and structuring what he wrote certainly was. He needed to work with actors and a director he could trust, and produced his performing drafts out of the experience of the rehearsal room. For this reason his working relationships with the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, the Live Theatre Company in Newcastle upon Tyne, and, towards the end of his life, with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), were especially productive. The eccentricity of his method was demonstrated while he was working on his two full-length Walter plays, <span class="italic">Getting By</span> and <span class="italic">Going Home</span> (Traverse, 1977), in which a dying Glaswegian music hall comedian reviews his complicated domestic and sexual relationships and his lifelong commitment to revolutionary socialism. The two plays were to be performed on consecutive evenings, and Taylor astounded the company after the first read-through by withdrawing the second play in its entirety, returning two days later with a new second script. His hyperactive working method, coupled with his inability to file his various drafts in any sort of order, continue to make the jobs of publisher and producer especially difficult. Typically, the success of <span class="italic">Good</span> (RSC, 1981), which tells the story of how an apparently good man ends up running a Nazi extermination camp, owes a great deal to the work of the original director, Howard Davies, and to the RSC actors.<br>
<br>At the outset of his career Taylor was convinced that his plays would inspire the working classes to demand social justice, taking to the streets if necessary. Experience caused him to scale down this headstrong ambition and one of the resultant dilemmas faced throughout his work is seen in the idealist's attempt to affect the course of history contrasted with his seeming inability to control his own private and personal life. In addition to <span class="italic">Good</span>, essential reading in Taylor's <i>&#339;uvre</i> includes <span class="italic">Allergy</span> (Traverse Theatre Club, 1966; published by Penguin, 1966), in which Jim, the editor of <i>Socialist Reflection</i> (circulation 150 copies) erupts in a skin rash every time he seeks sex and political enlightenment from Barbara; <span class="italic">Bread and Butter</span> (Traverse Theatre Club, 1966; published by Penguin, 1967), which traces the lives of two Scottish-Jewish couples from 1931 to 1965 and examines the way in which the great events of history affect their domestic relationships and political views; and <span class="italic">Lies about Vietnam</span> (Traverse Theatre Club, 1969; published in <span class="roman">Methuen Gay Plays</span>, 2, 1985), in which two gay anti-Vietnam War activists are harassed by a homophobic hotel manager.<br>
<br>Taylor's death was sudden and unexpected. He returned home from London after the opening of <span class="italic">Good</span> on 9 December 1981 in a state of exhaustion and was eventually taken to Morpeth General Hospital, where he died hours later from heart failure. With cruel irony <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> had announced his new play thus: &#145;Goodbye, C. P. Taylor&#146;. He left no will and his estate was shared between his widow and his four children. He was buried on 15 December in St Helen's churchyard, Longhorsley, Northumberland.<br>
