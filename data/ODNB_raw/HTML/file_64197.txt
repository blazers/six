<span class="headword">Beauclerk,  James</span>  (1709&#150;1787), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was born at Windsor, the seventh surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1847/', "Charles Beauclerk, first duke of St Albans (1670&#150;1726)")</script>, illegitimate offspring of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11816/', "Nell Gwyn")</script>. Some say his facial characteristics resembled those of his royal grandfather. His mother, Lady Diana de Vere (<i>d</i>. 1742), being the only surviving child of the last earl of Oxford was heraldic heir of England's oldest noble family. Three brothers were at court and others included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64848/', "Vere Beauclerk")</script>, admiral of the blue, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1846/', "Aubrey Beauclerk")</script>, a courageous naval commander, who was killed in action in 1741. Thus well connected, James Beauclerk's ecclesiastical ascent was predictably rapid.<br>
<br>Beauclerk was educated at Oxford, not at Christ Church, by then more popular with the aristocracy, but at Queen's College, which he entered in 1727. From there he graduated BA (1730), MA (1733), and BD and DD (1744). Nothing is known of his early career, except that in 1743/4&#150;1746 he was canon of Windsor. In 1746 he was consecrated bishop of Hereford at the early age of thirty-six. He remained bishop of Hereford until his death there forty-one years later. With a royal and aristocratic lineage such as his, historians might characterize Beauclerk as the archetypal absentee, lacklustre prelate, neglectful of his distant diocese and living at ease in London. This was not the case. Certainly he tried to use his connections to gain more preferment, but without success. Twice, in 1747 and 1752, he schemed for the clerkship of the closet, a valued court post, and then in 1763 for the deanery of Windsor, an aristocratic perquisite which he hoped to hold <i>in commendam</i> with his Hereford bishopric. In 1764, without his overt connivance, his brother Admiral Lord Vere sought to have him preferred to the senior diocese of London. All these approaches met with rebuff.<br>
<br>Despite all these manoeuvrings Beauclerk's activities as bishop suggest that he was clearly no political crony. His House of Lords attendance record, which averaged eight sittings per year, was scant compared with most of his Hereford predecessors. Philip Bisse, for instance, achieved an annual average of thirty-six, and the aristocratic Henry Egerton almost forty-eight. Nor was Beauclerk careless of his flock; throughout his long episcopate records reveal his outstanding conscientiousness and persistent determination to raise diocesan standards. Until a year before his death, at the age of seventy-eight, he personally conducted almost every diocesan ordination, not in London but in his cathedral, and usually as often as four times a year, the greatest frequency in the Hereford diocese since before the civil war. He demanded the highest standards from his ordinands. Candidates for the diaconate found him an unusual stickler over the required canonical age for ordination while non-graduates learned to fear the tests that he demanded. Even his officials had to meet his exacting standards. For instance he insisted that the required ordination documents were presented to him at least three weeks before the ceremony, because &#145;his lordship requires them in proper time&#146;  (ordination papers, 1757). He was also prepared to break with custom, for instance by signing schoolmasters' licences personally and by taking his chancellor's place in court proceedings over an incumbent's neglect of duty. Undoubtedly he was one of three Hereford bishops, with Herbert Croft and Bisse, to make the most conspicuous impact on diocesan life between 1660 and 1800.<br>
<br>Beauclerk never married but kept contact with his family. On 23 December 1752 he performed the marriage, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, of his nephew George Beauclerk, third duke of St Albans; in 1760 he temporarily took St Albans's place as registrar of the court of chancery during the duke's absence abroad. But at his death he left most of his possessions not to his family but to his secretary, Richard Jones. He died in Hereford on 20 October 1787 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral. His only extant publication is one sermon, preached to parliament on 30 January 1752, the anniversary of Charles I's execution. Despite his royal and aristocratic background here was a prelate devoted to his diocese.<br>
