<span class="headword">Booth,  Alfred</span>  (1834&#150;1914), <span class="occ">merchant and shipowner</span>, was born on 3 September 1834 in Liverpool, the eldest son of Charles Booth (1799&#150;1860) of the same city and Emily Fletcher (1803&#150;1853). His father's family ran a corn-factoring business and his mother's side was descended from West Indies merchants. He was educated at Edgbaston proprietary school and at the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute. In 1867 he married Lydia Allen Butler; they raised six children, two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Booth did not enter the family business but from 1850 worked for Lamport and Holt, shipping agents. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31966/', "Charles Booth (1840&#150;1916)")</script>, subsequently famous for his pioneering social investigations, joined him, but Alfred Booth left in 1857 for a brief appointment with Rathbones in New York, where he gained valuable experience in transatlantic trading. In 1860 he formed a partnership with Charles, and an American named Walden, to act as commission agents. More by chance than design they found themselves exporting skins to the United States, a small specialist business which exploited Booth's detailed knowledge and contacts but which did not compete with established trading. On Walden's retirement in 1863, the partnership was reconstituted as Alfred Booth &amp; Co. of Liverpool and Booth &amp; Co. of New York, with the brothers as principals, Alfred in the United States and Charles in Britain. Although supplemented by agency work and produce handling, the business was slow to prosper. Commission work brought only modest returns and the usual problems of price and seasonal fluctuations and the remittance of funds dogged the enterprise. However, improving American prospects after the civil war and investment in leather manufacturing on both sides of the Atlantic did increase profitability.<br>
<br>Encouraged perhaps by Charles Booth's fascination with steam shipping at a time when the compound engine was revolutionizing cargo traffic, and drawing upon their experience with Lamport and Holt, the brothers formed a shipping company to trade with northern Brazil. This market avoided competition with the established carriers to the east coast of Latin America but the new company could not afford a prolonged clash with R. Singlehurst &amp; Co., which was already exploiting the Amazon business. Since cargo volumes were still small and sailing ships undercut steamers, profits eluded the Booths until they created commercial stability through agreements with their competitors. Booths integrated leather and shipping into mutually supportive activities as Brazilian skins were exchanged for American produce, with the parent firm acting as a holding company. By 1914 Booths dominated the Amazon trade, operating one of Liverpool's largest fleets, and owned the Surpass Tanning Company in America, which obtained international status in kid leather.<br>
<br>Booth's contribution to the success of the firm which bore his name is hard to evaluate. He certainly possessed qualities crucial for business success&#151;sound judgement, an inability to suffer fools gladly, composure during commercial crises, and a methodical approach to administration. His tactical awareness complemented his brother's longer-term strategic sense. But Booth regarded business as a means to secure the financial independence required for the pursuit of life as a country gentleman, in complete contrast to his brother. He retired early, in 1887, before the firm's conspicuous success. Moreover, his experience and sources of funds, even the survival of the business in moments of crisis, owed much to the family alliances with the pillars of Liverpool's commercial &eacute;lite, the Holts, the Lamports, and the Rathbones. Luck, hard work, and adaptability enabled Booth to learn from past mistakes and to seize opportunities when they arose.<br>
<br>In his private life Booth, though reserved, inspired loyalty and affection. In the best traditions of Liverpool merchants he gave generously of his time and money to public and philanthropic activities, both as a magistrate and as a devout Unitarian. Politically, he supported the Liberal cause. He died at his home, 46 Ullet Road, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 2 November 1914, of pneumonia and heart failure.<br>
