<span class="headword">Lisle,  John</span>, appointed Lord Lisle under the protectorate  (1609/10&#150;1664), <span class="occ">regicide</span>, was the second, but eldest surviving, son of Sir William Lisle (<i>d</i>. 1648) of Wootton, Isle of Wight, and Bridget, daughter of Sir John Hungerford of Down Ampney, Gloucestershire. On 25 January 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, graduated BA in February, and proceeded to the Middle Temple in May, aged sixteen. He was called to the bar in 1633, becoming a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1649. On 15 February 1632 he married Elizabeth Mary Hobart (<i>d</i>. 1633), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13391/', "Sir Henry Hobart")</script>, lord chief justice, with a massive dowry of &pound;4000. An anonymous poet wrote that Elizabeth was:<blockquote>
<div>Neither well-proportioned, fair nor wise<br>
</div>
<div>All these defects four thousand pounds supplies.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The dowry, said to have been the largest ever in the Isle of Wight, helped to offset Sir William's feckless extravagance, and after Elizabeth died in childbirth Lisle acquired another heiress, Alice Beconshaw (<i>c</i>.1614&#150;1685) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16754/', "Lisle, Lady Alice")</script>], daughter of Sir White Beconshaw of Moyle's Court near Fordingbridge, whom he married in 1636. According to the arrangements Lisle took over his father's estate at this juncture, giving him &pound;150 p.a. allowance; on Beconshaw's death Alice brought him Moyle's Court and half the estate of Ellingham.<br>
<br>Lisle was chosen as MP for Winchester in March and October 1640, and as an energetic civil war parliamentarian took a leading role on county committees to fund the war effort and defend Hampshire, Portsmouth, and Wight. On the eviction of Dr William Lewis in November 1644 he was made master of St Cross Hospital, Winchester. In parliament he chaired the committee investigating Cromwell's allegations against the earl of Manchester in December 1644, and that in January 1645 appointed to frame the ordinance creating the New Model Army. He displayed hostility to the king right from 1642, condemning him in a 1645 speech to the lord mayor and citizens of London after the capture of royal correspondence at the battle of Naseby. He was one of the parliamentary commissioners chosen to take Charles the four bills, parliament's latest terms for a settlement, in December 1647. His growing national prominence was offset by local concern at his niggardly treatment of his father. Lisle's godfather, Sir John Oglander, who claimed that Lisle had grown up with maternal neglect and paternal alcoholic excess, complained that Sir William was allowed but &#145;one nasty chamber&#146; for all his possessions and animals. Sir William's extravagance may have made his son over concerned to protect his inheritance. When Sir William died in 1648, refusing to see his children, Lisle arranged a cheap evening funeral.<br>
<br>Voting against negotiations with Charles in November to December 1648, Lisle was selected as a commissioner for his trial and took a leading role, sitting next to the president to advise him on legal matters. He helped to draw up the sentence, along with the new republican form of the constitution and legal procedure, and had his reward with his appointment as commissioner of the great seal from 8 February 1649 at a salary of &pound;1000 p.a [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He was one of the committee of five trusted to select councillors of state and vet MPs, and pressed for legal reform particularly of chancery. He was, however, keen to acquire the fruits of office, leasing Beaufort House, Chelsea, and persuading his fellow commissioner Bulstrode Whitelocke to join him there to seem less ostentatious. Whitelocke accused him of fixing their lots for which lodgings to occupy to avoid those needing repair, further indication of miserliness. When the commissioners borrowed Sion House in August 1649 Lisle invited the earl of Mulgrave to move in without asking Whitelocke.<br>
<br>Despite his republicanism Lisle had no hesitation in retaining office under Cromwell, to whom he administered the oath of office. Elected to parliament on 12 July 1654 for Southampton, where he was recorder from 1651&#150;9, and the Isle of Wight, he chose to sit for the former. He presided over the high court trying royalist plotters in 1654, 1655, and 1658, became a commissioner of the exchequer in 1655, and was retained as commissioner of the great seal when his colleagues were dismissed on 15 June 1655. He supported Cromwell's becoming king, and took a seat in the other house in December 1657. He was eventually dismissed by the restored Rump on 14 May 1659, but unlike most Cromwellians he was sufficiently trusted to become a commissioner for the admiralty and navy in January 1660 and a local militia commissioner.<br>
<br>Lisle was a prime target at the Restoration for his role in the king's trial, and fled abroad just before a parliamentary vote on 6 June 1660 exempting him from pardon and requiring his surrender. His lands were seized. His exiled younger brother, Sir William, a royalist, regained Wootton; Alice retained Moyle's Court but not Ellingham. Lisle's younger son William's mother-in-law, Lady Katherine Hyde, petitioned for land to support William, disinherited for his royalist sympathies. Lisle settled by May 1663 in Lausanne with other republicans including Ludlow, Whalley, and Goffe, and was said to &#145;much charm&#146; the Swiss with his religious devotion. Already fearing assassination, he was shot at a church door in Lausanne by an Irish royalist known as Thomas Macdonnell (allegedly shouting &#145;Vive le roi&#146;) on 11 August 1664 and was buried in the church; the murder was greeted with pleasure in London. His fellow exile Edmund Ludlow incorporated some of his papers into his MS, &#145;Voyce from the watch tower&#146;.<br>
<br>Lisle's second wife, Alice, was executed by Judge Jeffreys in 1685. As well as two sons, John (<i>d</i>. 1709) of Dibden, Hampshire, and William, he had at least three daughters, including Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1723), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13380/', "Leonard Hoar")</script>. An efficient constitutional lawyer and genuine reformer capable of putting principle above safety, he cannot be dismissed as just a Cromwellian timeserver. But his ability was countered by acquisitiveness, a reputation for intrigue, a personal harshness, and resort to sharp practice. Loathed by royalists, as the events of 1664 showed, harsh criticism came too from among family and friends.<br>
