<span class="headword">Stanhope, Sir  Michael</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1508, <em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the second son of Sir Edward Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1511), knight of the body to Henry VII, and Adelina, daughter of Sir Gervase Clifton of Clifton, Nottinghamshire. In January 1529, following the death of his elder brother, Richard, without male children, he became head of the Stanhope family; by November 1537 he had married Anne (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1588), daughter of Nicholas Rawson of Aveley, Essex, and they had seven sons and four daughters. Among his sons were the lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26244/', "Sir Edward Stanhope")</script> and the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26249/', "John Stanhope")</script>.<br>
<br>Although Stanhope was in the service of Thomas Manners, first earl of Rutland, by 1532, it was his part in preventing the rebellion in Lincolnshire spreading to neighbouring counties in the autumn of 1536 that brought him significant provincial advancement. In Nottinghamshire he served as a justice of the peace from 1537, and as bailiff of the lordship of Knessall and keeper of the park there from 1538, while in 1545 and 1547 he was returned to parliament as knight of the shire for the county. Stanhope also secured much former monastic property in Nottinghamshire: most importantly, he purchased Shelford Priory and several neighbouring manors in November 1537; in 1539 he obtained the lease of Lenton Priory and appointment as bailiff of the lordship; and, in 1540, he bought Shelford Manor and lands nearby. During the early 1540s he also obtained office in Yorkshire: as lieutenant of the garrison of Kingston upon Hull in February 1542; as a commissioner of the peace in the West Riding from 1543, and in the East and North ridings from 1544; and, by September 1544, he had become governor of Hull. His responsibilities at Hull, moreover, involved not only maintaining the town's defences and guarding its vital armoury but also an important role in Anglo-Scottish relations, supplying provisions, men, and ships for Berwick, border campaigns, and English expeditions into Scotland. Apparently, though, his high-handedness provoked resentment among the townsmen of Hull, while he himself complained to the privy council in 1546 about their &#145;lewd behaviour&#146; towards him.<br>
<br>Stanhope's sister Anne had by 1535 married Sir Edward Seymour as his second wife. Already a courtier and favourite of Henry VIII, Seymour was probably instrumental in bringing Stanhope to prominence at national level. First securing a modest post in the royal stables in 1538, he became an esquire of the body in 1540, and by February 1546 he had been knighted. Once his patron, newly created duke of Somerset, had overthrown Henry VIII's will and obtained effective regency powers for himself as protector to the young Edward VI, Stanhope's career took off with a vengeance. Somerset appointed him groom of the stool in August 1547 (an office that gave him control of the king's privy purse) and master of the king's harriers in July 1548, while by 1549 he had become chief gentleman of the privy chamber. His office made him effectively Edward's keeper. Soon acknowledged as both a highly influential member of Somerset's household and a leading figure in the royal entourage, Stanhope's identification with his patron became even more blatant when he accompanied Somerset to Windsor during the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> by the London lords in the autumn of 1549. Once they had successfully taken possession of Edward VI's person, Somerset found himself incarcerated in Windsor Castle and Stanhope was placed under house arrest; and when Somerset was transferred to the Tower of London in mid-October, Stanhope was among those accompanying him to imprisonment.<br>
<br>Released in February 1550, after entering into a bond of &pound;3000 to &#145;be from day to day furthcumyng and to abyde all orders&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1547&#150;50</i>, 398), Stanhope was once more a prisoner in the Tower by the end of October 1551, this time on a charge of involvement in Somerset's conspiracy against the now all-powerful duke of Northumberland. In January 1552 he was brought to trial for having &#145;feloniously&#146; instigated Somerset to insurrection and &#145;holding rebellious assemblies, for the purpose of taking, imprisoning and murdering&#146; the duke of Northumberland, the marquess of Northampton, and the earl of Pembroke  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.369). Pleading not guilty and asserting that he had &#145;never offended against the King's Majestie nor against any of his Counsell&#146;  (Wriothesley, 2.67), Stanhope was nevertheless convicted of felony and sentenced to be hanged. In the event he was beheaded on Tower Hill on 26 February 1552. An act confirming his attainder was passed by parliament in April 1552 but reversed early in Queen Mary's reign, when his son and heir, Thomas, took possession of the family lands. His widow, Anne, it was reported, &#145;brought up all her yonger children in vertue and learninge&#146; at Lenton Priory and &#145;kept contynewallie a worshipfull house&#146; there until her death in 1587  (<span class="italic">Revd J. Standish's paper</span>, 46).<br>
