<span class="headword">Loring, Sir  John Wentworth</span>  (1775&#150;1852), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in America on 13 October 1775, was the grandson of Commodore Joshua Loring (<i>d</i>. 1781), who commanded the flotilla employed on the North American lakes in the Seven Years' War. His father, Joshua Loring, was high sheriff of Massachusetts before the American War of Independence; he moved to England and settled in Berkshire.<br>
<br>John Loring entered the navy in June 1789 on the <i>Salisbury</i>, flagship of Vice-Admiral Milbanke on the Newfoundland station. He returned to England in 1791, continued on the home station and in the Mediterranean, and as midshipman of the <i>Victory</i> was severely wounded at the evacuation of Toulon on 17 December 1793. He commanded a gunboat at the siege of Bastia. On 24 May 1794 he was promoted lieutenant of the sloop <i>Fl&ecirc;che</i> and was shortly afterwards moved to the <i>St George</i>, flagship of Sir Hyde Parker. In her he was present in the two actions off Toulon on 13&#150;14 March and 13 July 1795. At the beginning of 1796 he followed Parker to the <i>Britannia</i>, in which he returned to England, and towards the end of the year went out to the West Indies in the fireship <i>Comet</i> to rejoin Parker, then commander-in-chief at Jamaica.<br>
<br>In June 1798 Loring was appointed acting commander of the sloop <i>Rattler</i> (16 guns), and in September of the <i>Lark</i> (18 guns), to which he was confirmed on 3 January 1799. In the <i>Lark</i> he cruised successfully against enemy privateers and merchant ships, for which he was publicly thanked by Sir Hugh Seymour, and appointed acting captain of the <i>Abergavenny</i> (54 guns) in April 1801. In October 1801 he was moved to the frigate <i>Syren</i> (32 guns), and in March 1802, while cruising off Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, suppressed a dangerous mutiny with a coolness that drew the praise of Sir John Duckworth. On Duckworth's recommendation the Admiralty confirmed Loring's post rank to 28 April 1802, the day before the general promotion in honour of the peace. Loring married on 18 July 1804 Anna, daughter of Vice-Admiral Patton, then a lord of the Admiralty. They had three daughters and three sons, the second of whom was Admiral Sir William Loring KCB (<i>d</i>. 1895).<br>
<br>In 1803&#150;4 Loring commanded the <i>Utrecht</i> (64 guns), flagship of successive admirals in the Downs, and in 1805 the <i>Aurora</i>, in a voyage to Bermuda and back; but his war service was chiefly identified with the <i>Niobe</i>, a 38-gun frigate, which he commanded on the coast of France from November 1805 until 1813. On the dark night of 28 March 1806 he pursued and took silent possession of the brig <i>N&eacute;arque</i> (16 guns) out of a squadron of three frigates of equal or superior force. On 13 November 1810 he took part with Captain Grant of the <i>Diana</i> (38 guns) in driving under the batteries of La Hougue two 40-gun French frigates, one of which got on the rocks and was burnt by her own people, while the other escaped, only to be driven on shore and burnt at Cape Barfleur on 24 March 1811, by a British squadron, of which the <i>Niobe</i> was one. Thirteen days previously the <i>Niobe</i>, while watching the port of Le Havre, had captured the privateer <i>Loup Marin</i> (16 guns).<br>
<br>In 1813&#150;14 Loring commanded the <i>Impregnable</i> as flag captain to Admiral William Young in the North Sea. On 4 June 1815 he was made CB. From 1816 to 1819 he was superintendent of the ordinary at Sheerness, and from 4 November 1819 lieutenant-governor of the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, until his promotion to flag rank on 10 January 1837. He was made KCH on 30 April 1837, KCB on 4 July 1840, became vice-admiral on 9 November 1846, and admiral on 8 July 1851. He settled in 1837 at Ryde in the Isle of Wight, where he died on 29 July 1852.<br>
