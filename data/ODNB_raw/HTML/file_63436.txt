<span class="headword">Scott,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1631), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish and Danish services and military inventor</span>, is a man of whom nothing is known before 1623, when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden granted the Scot James Spens, son of the Stuart ambassador in Stockholm, Sir James Spens, authority to levy a body of Scottish soldiers for Swedish service. In the same year Scott levied 200 men for the king of Sweden, presumably as part of Spens's recruitment drive. For the next five years Scott served in the Swedish army, eventually acting as the army's quartermaster-general. Scott was mentioned in royal correspondence to the Danish Court by Erik Krabbe, the Danish resident in Stockholm, in connection with Gustavus Adolphus's impending campaign in western Prussia in 1628. The Danes were interested in Scott because of his development of light artillery.<br>
<br>While in Swedish service Scott developed a type of leather-covered cannon, also known as the leather gun, in competition with that of Melchior von Wurmbrand. These cannon were revolutionary in that they were light enough to be carried by two men, they fired the same size shot as conventional cannon with half the powder, and they could fire up to a hundred times without having to be left to cool down. Scott used different proportions to Wurmbrand in the construction of his cannon. He also told the king that he had contrived a way of reloading his cannon ten times before a soldier could reload his musket once. Some Danish noblemen witnessed a demonstration of the leather cannon in Stockholm at which the Swedish king was said to have been suitably impressed. However, Scott wished payment of 20,000 Swedish riksdaler for his invention, a sum which Gustavus Adolphus refused to pay.<br>
<br>The Danes successfully recruited Scott from Swedish service in 1628 and he received his appointment as the master-general of artillery on 6 September. This appointment has caused some historical debate since such a military rank had not previously existed within the Danish army. None the less a record exists in the Copenhagen archive of Scott's appointment as &#145;General Artillerimeister&#146; with a salary of 400 Danish rigsdaler per month, four times that of other officers of artillery. Scott's service for the Danish crown was short, and had ended by the time Denmark pulled out of the Thirty Years' War. Scott left the service of Christian IV to return to England. The exact date of his departure is unclear, some sources suggesting October or November 1628 and others placing his leaving some time after the treaty of L&uuml;beck in 1629. He was certainly in Stuart service by September 1629. There he acted as a gentleman of the bedchamber to Charles I.<br>
<br>As part of his Stuart service Scott received new accommodation from the crown. Charles I wrote to Attorney-General Heath on 3 September 1629 ordering him to purchase a house in Lambeth, which came with 8 acres of land. For this purpose Heath was ordered to contract himself to the chancellor of the exchequer for the sum of &pound;1400. Five months later, on 15 February 1630, Scott and his family were issued with a grant of denization. This document notes that Scott had a wife named Anne and two children, Charles and Anne, as well as a nephew also called Robert Scott. According to Sir James Balfour Paul  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 2.282), Scott's other nephew, James Wemyss, was also included in an act of denization issued to Scott in 1630, although no mention of this appears in the <span class="italic">Calendar of State Papers, Domestic</span>.<br>
<br>Within only a few days of the grant of denization being issued, on 20 February 1630, it was ordered that Scott should receive &pound;600 per annum in wages. During this brief time in the service of Charles I, Scott managed to introduce the leather cannon into the British Isles, but he did not live to see the deployment of his weapon. He died in 1631 and was buried in St Mary, Lambeth, in Surrey where an epitaph to his artillery invention can be found.<br>
<br>The effectiveness of the leather cannon has been doubted  (G. Parker, <span class="italic">The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West, 1500&#150;1800</span>, 1996, 33&#150;35), but there is ample evidence of its being regarded as an excellent weapon during the wars in the three Stuart kingdoms between 1638 and 1651. It first saw service with the Scottish covenanters in the version developed by General Alexander Hamilton, known as &#145;Dear Sandy's stoup&#146;. Later, leather cannon could be found in the English parliamentarian and Cromwellian service in the Scott model, as developed and refined by his nephew Wemyss. Many of these guns also ended up in royalist service after the capture of Wemyss and his artillery train in 1644.<br>
