<span class="headword">Gisleham, Sir  William  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1230&#150;1293), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born <i>c</i>.1230 in the village of Gisleham in north-east Suffolk. He was the son of a minor landowner, Richard son of Moses of Gisleham, and his first known appearance in surviving records is an appointment in 1259 to act as his father's attorney. The pattern of his appointments to act as an attorney for other litigants suggests that he may have become a professional lawyer by 1260. He had almost certainly entered the small &eacute;lite of professional serjeants by 1271. During the 1270s he may have been a serjeant in the common bench and may also have regularly appeared for litigants at local assize sessions.<br>
<br>There was a major reorganization of the general eyre in the summer of 1278. This established what were intended to be two permanent eyre circuits, and added to their jurisdiction the receipt of claims to franchises in each of the counties they visited, and the determination of royal challenges to such claims. There is no evidence that Gisleham attended the first eyre on the &#145;southern&#146; eyre circuit held in Hertfordshire in the autumn of 1278, but he did act as the king's serjeant on the circuit's second eyre, which opened in Kent in January 1279. Thereafter he acted either on his own or sometimes with a junior colleague in each eyre of the &#145;southern&#146; circuit before the Wiltshire eyre of 1289, aggressively challenging claims to franchises on behalf of the king, and also making property claims on the king's behalf. During the same decade he seems also to have regularly acted for private clients on the same eyres, and to have managed to fit in a number of appearances in the common bench, on behalf both of private clients and of the crown. He was appointed one of the justices of the common bench in mid-January 1290, as one of the replacements for the justices who had been disgraced during the &#145;state trials&#146; which began in 1289. From the summer of 1290 he also served as a regular assize justice in East Anglia. A number of surviving law reports of the period show him at work in the common bench, most often by himself but sometimes with his senior colleague, John of Mettingham (<i>d</i>. 1301), and less commonly with his fellow justice, Robert of Hartforth. Knighted by January 1292, Gisleham served as a royal justice for just three years before dying suddenly in a boat, perhaps one carrying him from Westminster to his home in London, in mid-February 1293.<br>
<br>Gisleham's first wife, Agnes, was the daughter and one of the heirs of the London merchant and alderman, Walter of Winchester, and the widow of Adrian Eswy, who had also belonged to London's mercantile &eacute;lite. They were married by 1260, and she brought him property in London and a claim to dower lands in Surrey and Middlesex. By 1285 he was married to a second wife, Alice, who may have brought him property at Barking and Dagenham in Essex. Gisleham left no sons and the manor he had reassembled in Kessingland, the next village to Gisleham, and a second major holding at Ilketshall and three other Suffolk villages, passed to his heirs. They were his daughter Clemencia and another Clemencia, the daughter of Agnes, probably his granddaughter, who later married William Tivetshall.<br>
