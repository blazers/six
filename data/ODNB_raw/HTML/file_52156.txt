<span class="headword">Spinola,  Benedict</span>  (1519/20&#150;1580), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was one of the six children, the second son, of Battista Spinola of Genoa and his wife, Elisabetta, daughter of Giacomo Spinola. The Spinolas had long been prominent in Genoa (in 1556 Battista would decline the dogeship), and Benedict was born there. His early history is unknown but he appears in London in 1541, employed by Bastian Bony, postmaster, as a clerk at &pound;2 a year: working for the postal service of London's foreign merchants gave Spinola ready access to the world of commerce and finance. He resided in St Gabriel Fenchurch parish (where he remained until he died) with his nephews Hannibal and Ascaneo Spinola. His property in Shoreditch, Middlesex, was popularly known as &#145;Spinola's pleasure&#146;. During 1544&#150;52, at least, he was associated with Acelin Salvago, a Genoese merchant.<br>
<br>Unusually, Spinola was granted full denization in 1552, a privilege allowing him to pay taxes and customs dues at the Englishman's rates. By 1559 he was exporting woollen cloth at customs dues up to &pound;200, and importing sweet wines to &pound;40, a year. Illegally, he exported another's goods on his own licence (1561), and his signed confession survives; but his 1566 grant permitted this, and raised his limits to &pound;2000 and &pound;400 over a longer period. He had shipped his full quota of 4800 cloths by the end of 1569 but imported only 3845&#151;out of 5342&#151;butts of wine by Michaelmas 1570. Moreover, important communities of Italian merchants had been established in Antwerp and London, largely because of the luxury textiles and other wares carried from Italy overland to &#145;Flanders&#146; (mostly Brabant), often for trans-shipment: hence, while his brothers Francisco, Pasquale, and Giacomo resided in Antwerp, Spinola himself lived in London, where he was in the very top rank of merchants. Requiring hangings for the dining chamber at Kenilworth Castle, the earl of Leicester told his man to &#145;deal with Mr Spinola&#146;, who was &#145;able to get such stuff better cheap than any man&#146;  (Jackson, 92). In 1572 Leicester asked Francis Walsingham, then in France, to favour Spinola in his (unspecified) &#145;great cause&#146;, as &#145;he is my dear friend and the best Italian I know in England&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 260, fol. 363).<br>
<br>Spinola objected when, about 1550, Michael Angelo Florio, the minister of the (Calvinist) Italian church, preached against &#145;Popish&#146; doctrines; but in 1566 the Spanish ambassador reported to Philip II that Spinola was now confirmed in his Anglicanism. Inclusion of his name in a list of suspected &#145;papists&#146; (1578) was doubtless an error. By 1568 he and his household, inclusive of the French cook, were attending their parish church. Spinola's growing affluence is evident from his assessments for subsidy: in 1544, on &pound;5; 1549, &pound;20; in 1559, Spinola &#145;and his company&#146; were assessed on &pound;500; in 1564, &pound;200; and in 1576, &pound;100. The later reductions hint at his improved, favoured, status as an adviser to the government, gathering intelligence through his foreign correspondents and as an important negotiator in political and financial matters, as in the settlement of the Antwerp embargo, 1564&#150;5. By virtue of his state and business interests, he often handled immense sums, so that, on 24 June 1574, he was owed amounts totalling &pound;27, 879 9<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>In 1568 the ships carrying the money for paying the duke of Alva's troops were forced into English ports by Huguenot raiders. For safety, the silver was conveyed ashore, whereupon Alva denounced this as an English plot for stealing the money, at Spinola's suggestion. When the government repaid the Genoese lenders, Spinola acted for it. In 1578 Spinola, with Horatio Palavicino, was an agent for arranging the loan to the Union of Brussels. On his eventual return from the Netherlands he made his Italian will on 6 July 1580. He was then somewhat infirm, <i>alquanto indisposto del corpo</i>: in fact he died of plague, and was buried in the choir&#151;a mark of his high standing locally&#151;of St Gabriel's Church on 15 August 1580. He had never married, and probate was granted to his nephew, Giacomo Spinola, on 29 October.<br>
