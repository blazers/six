<span class="headword">Shirley,  Laurence</span>, fourth Earl Ferrers  (1720&#150;1760), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born on 18 August 1720, the eldest son of Laurence Shirley (1693&#150;1743) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1782), fourth daughter of Sir Walter Clarges, first baronet. His father was the fourth son of Robert Shirley, first Earl Ferrers. Laurence matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1737, but did not take a degree. He succeeded to the peerage and estates on the death in 1745 of his uncle Henry, third Earl Ferrers, who had been confined as a lunatic. He was inactive in the Lords, but did enter a protest against the war in Flanders on 2 May 1746, and another against the bill for the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in Scotland on 21 May 1747. On 16 September 1752 he married Mary (1737/8?&#150;1807), fifth daughter of Amos Meredith, of Henbury, Cheshire, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18580/', "Sir William Meredith, third baronet")</script>. The marriage was childless. He was an aggressive husband who imprisoned his wife in his house at Staunton Harold in Leicestershire until the king's bench with difficulty obtained her release. The London consistory court took the severe step of excommunicating him for contempt in 1757 after his wife had initiated a separation suit in that court. She separated from him on the grounds of his cruelty, by act of parliament, in 1758. Thereafter he lived at Staunton Harold with his mistress, &#145;Mrs&#146; Margaret Clifford, whose father, Richard Clifford, farmed nearby at Breedon. Ferrers and his mistress had four daughters.<br>
<br>Although often lucid and businesslike, Ferrers had phases during which he was distracted or ungovernably excited. In these fits his gesticulation, grimacing, and suspicion of secret plots were wild. He became so overwrought after quarrelling with Sir Thomas Stapleton in 1758 that his family considered taking out a commission of lunacy against him. In addition to his brutal temper, he was prone to other freaks of behaviour. Under the act of separation of 1758 Ferrers's estates were vested in trustees, and John Johnson, who had been in the service of the Shirleys for many years, was appointed receiver of the rents. Ferrers developed an obsessive resentment of his steward, and on 18 January 1760 shot him with a pistol in a locked room at Staunton Harold. Johnson languished for a day before dying. The crime was premeditated, and afterwards Ferrers, both sober and drunk, upbraided Johnson as a villain. On 19 January the earl was spotted crossing his bowling green, armed with a blunderbuss, dagger, and pistols, trying to escape the crowd of colliers that had come to detain him. He was apprehended, and after examination at the bar of the House of Lords (13 February) was committed as a prisoner in the Tower of London.<br>
<br>Ferrers's trial by his peers began on 16 April in Westminster Hall. At his brothers' prompting, he tried to escape a capital sentence by arguing that he was periodically insane, and not responsible for his actions at the time of the murder. He called the Bethlem doctor John Monro as an expert witness, whose testimony raised important issues of criminal responsibility and lunacy. Horace Walpole, who attended the trial, described its &#145;pomp and awfulness&#146; to George Montagu.<blockquote>In general he behaved rationally and coolly; though it was a strange contradiction to see a man trying by his own sense to prove himself out of his senses. It was more shocking to see his two brothers brought to prove the lunacy in their own blood, in order to save their brother's life. Both are almost as ill-looking men as the Earl. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.279)</blockquote>Despite his efforts, on 17 April the Lords unanimously found Ferrers guilty of felony and murder. The next day the lord keeper, Robert Henley, first Baron Henley, acting as lord high steward, sentenced him to death. The grandeur and solemnity of the occasion were impressive despite the &#145;modish&#146; nature of some spectators. According to Elizabeth Montagu, &#145;ladies crowded to the House of Lords to see a wretch brought loaded with crime and shame to the bar, to hear sentence of a cruel and ignominious death; which, considering only this world, cast shame back on his ancestors, and all his succeeding family&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.261&#150;2). During the trial and after his conviction he was regularly visited by his cousin Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, the prominent Methodist, who concerned herself with his spiritual welfare, and prevented him from seeing his mistress before his execution.<br>
<br>Ferrers was hanged on 5 May at Tyburn gallows. William Hickey attended the execution:<blockquote>His lordship was conveyed to Tyburn in his own landau, dressed in a superb suit of white and silver, being the clothes in which he was married, his reason for wearing which was that they had been his first step towards ruin, and should attend his exit. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of William Hickey</span>, 1.20)</blockquote>According to Walpole, &#145;this horrid lunatic &hellip; shamed heroes&#146; in his final comportment. &#145;He was stopped at the gallows by the vast crowd, but got out of his coach as soon as he could, and was but seven minutes on the scaffold, which was hung with black &hellip; The mob was decent, admired him, and almost pitied him&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.283). The tradition that Ferrers was hanged by a silk cord instead of a hemp rope was denied by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and is not mentioned by any of the eyewitness accounts, but has become part of the mythologized story of the execution. His remains were dissected by anatomists before burial under the belfry at St Pancras, but were reinterred at Staunton Harold on 3 June 1782.<br>
<br>Ferrers was said to have left &pound;4000 in East India Company bonds for the benefit of his mistress, Margaret Clifford, and their children, and to the family of his victim, Johnson. Johnson's family were also made the beneficiaries of &pound;6000 raised from Ferrers's estate and held in trust for their use. Ferrers's wife married, on 28 March 1769, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4495/', "Lord Frederick Campbell (1729&#150;1816)")</script>, and was killed in a fire, supposedly caused by an accident with a light while she was reading in bed, at Coombe Bank, Kent, on 26 July 1807.<br>
<br>Ferrers's brother <a name="cosubject_25441"></a><span class="headword">Washington Shirley</span>, fifth Earl Ferrers  (1722&#150;1778), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 26 May 1722, and entered the navy around 1738. He was made second lieutenant on 6 January 1741, promoted first lieutenant on 9 January 1746, and post captain on 19 April 1746. On 1 December 1747 he married Anne (1722/3&#150;1791), daughter of John Elliot, of Plymouth, Devon, at St George's, East Stonehouse, Devon. He took his seat in the House of Lords a fortnight after his brother's execution (19 May 1760), and by a patent of 6 December 1763 George III granted to him the family estates which had been forfeited by his brother as a felon. This patent was confirmed by act of parliament in 1771. Ferrers was promoted rear-admiral of the white on 31 March, vice-admiral of the blue on 7 December 1775, and vice-admiral of the white on 29 January 1778. Casanova, visiting London, was surprised that he was not &#145;dishonoured&#146;  (Casanova, 5.203), or ostracized, as a result of his brother's crime.<br>
<br>In 1763 Ferrers began to transform his seat at Staunton Harold, which in its location and surroundings is an exceptionally pure example of rural England. The Shirley family had lived there since the fifteenth century. He remodelled the north front, extended the east front, and added a south front. The exterior style of the house is Palladian, with widely spaced windows and Doric columns, but the interior has many neo-classical features. He retained the Gothic chapel, built during the Commonwealth, standing at an angle to the house on the south-east, adding to the air of calm and measured beauty. The overall effect is highly accomplished if, as seems likely, Ferrers was his own architect. At the time of his death these alterations were almost complete. The old formal gardens, with basins and canals, were also replaced by fashionable landscaping with two lakes. These improvements were partly financed by sales during the mid-1760s and in 1775 of ancestral properties in Northamptonshire and Derbyshire.<br>
<br>Ferrers was evidently a virtuoso among admirals, for he was elected FRS in 1761 as recognition of his observations on the transit of Venus and for other mathematical investigations. He was grand master of the freemasons (1762&#150;4). He died on 1 October 1778 at Chartley Manor Place, Staffordshire, the ancient home of the Ferrers family, and was buried on 11 October at Staunton Harold. His wife died at Hampton Court, Middlesex, on 26 March 1791. They had no children, and Ferrers was succeeded in the earldom and estates by his brother Robert (1723&#150;1787). Another brother was the Methodist preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25438/', "Walter Shirley (1725&#150;1786)")</script>.<br>
