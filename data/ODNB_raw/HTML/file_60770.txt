<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cobb,  Richard Charles</span>  (1917&#150;1996), <span class="occ">historian and essayist</span>, was born on 20 May 1917 at Hurstlyn, Fourth Avenue, Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, the only son of Francis Hills Cobb, a civil engineer in the Sudan civil service, and his wife, Dora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Swindale. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and went to Merton College, Oxford, in 1935 with a postmastership to read modern history. He graduated in 1938 with a second-class degree. He immediately went to Paris to do research, but returned to England in September 1939 at the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>After failing the medical test, Cobb went into the Air Ministry in a civilian post until 1941. His ambition, however, was to work either in France or with the Free French. Unsuccessful in his attempts to achieve this, he became somewhat agitated and was only rescued from difficulty by the intervention of his mother through a military acquaintance. He was sent to work as liaison with the Czechoslovak independent brigade group, which he always saw as a compromise between himself and the government. Here he helped to prepare the assassination of Heydrich, the <i>gauleiter</i> of Bohemia. He was later attached to the Polish military authorities. Between 1944 and 1946 he served as an interpreter in France and Belgium.<br>
<br>Demobilized in France, he remained there until 1955 doing research in French national and local archives. He worked under Georges Lefebvre, the professor of the history of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne, with whom he began a monumental doctoral thesis, <span class="italic">Les arm&eacute;es r&eacute;volutionnaires: instrument de la Terreur dans les d&eacute;partements, avril 1793 &#150; flor&eacute;al an II</span> (2 vols., 1961&#150;3). He did not in fact gain the doctoral degree in France since he did not write the <i>th&egrave;se suppl&eacute;mentaire</i> which was then a requirement.<br>
<br>Cobb's abiding passion for France and for the radical phase of the French Revolution was ignited during the year he spent in Paris, staying with a French family near the Porte St Martin and working on a never-completed Oxford thesis on the H&eacute;bertiste faction. During his post-war years he became completely assimilated into the world of French, mostly communist historians in this field. Although not the only foreigner in the group, he was certainly the dominant one, both by the length of his stay and by the degree of his integration. Possessed of perfect French (<span class="italic">Les arm&eacute;es r&eacute;volutionnaires</span> was written directly in French), he was sustained through years of real penury by a mixture of small jobs and free food brought to him by a network which was based on politically tinged camaraderie, admiration for his real gifts, and affection.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1952 Cobb married Fran&ccedil;oise Suzanne Marguerite Richard (1914&#150;1994), daughter of a French army officer; she was then working for the French national railways, SNCF. They had one son, but the marriage was dissolved in 1957. His second marriage took place at Tonbridge, Kent, on 6 March 1963 to Margaret Goggin, daughter of James Goggin, a quantity surveyor. She was then a student at Leeds University. Three sons and a daughter were born to the marriage, which lasted until his death.<br>
<br>Cobb had returned to the United Kingdom in 1955 in order to take up a lectureship at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. By his own account, Georges Lefebvre, in receipt of a letter from the head of department there seeking advice on filling a post in the field, dispatched Cobb with words to the effect that he had been too long in France and needed a proper job. It is evident that the move to Aberystwyth was an enormous rupture for him. He later wrote some compelling sketches of the sense of isolation and claustrophobia in a small university town, where the most comforting event was a weekly walk to the railway station in order to check that it was still there and escape thus possible.<br>
<br>He spent the year 1959&#150;60 as a Simon senior research fellow at Manchester University and moved to a lectureship at Leeds University in 1961. In 1962 he became a tutorial fellow at Balliol College, Oxford. It was during his ten years there that his historical writing developed a broad sweep and compelling maturity. At the same time his idiosyncratic character, unrestrained opinions, strong likes and dislikes, and fondness for liberal, noisy entertainment gave him something of a legendary reputation among students and colleagues. Many undergraduates and postgraduates found him inspirational; many people were attracted to him; few could be indifferent.<br>
<br>He was elected fellow of the British Academy in 1967. In 1969 he was appointed reader in French Revolutionary history at Oxford and then, in 1972, he took the chair of modern history, which was attached to a fellowship of Worcester College. He retired in 1984. He won the Wolfson prize for history in 1979. He was an honorary fellow of Balliol College (1977) and of Merton College (1980) and held honorary doctorates from Essex, Leeds, and Cambridge (1981, 1988, 1989). He was awarded the CBE in 1978 and created officier de l'ordre national du m&eacute;rite (1977) and chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1986). He died at his home, 18 Wintenbourne Road, Abingdon, on 15 January 1996.<br>
<br>The quality and the influence of Cobb's historical writing&#151;principally <span class="italic">Les arm&eacute;es r&eacute;volutionnaires</span> (1961&#150;3), <span class="italic">Terreur et subsistances</span> (1965), <span class="italic">The Police and the People</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Reactions to the French Revolution</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Paris and its Provinces</span> (1975), <span class="italic">Death in Paris</span> (1978)&#151;resided, first, in his exceptional and intimate knowledge of the French archives. The range of his experience in all types of national and local collections surpassed that of any contemporary French historian, let alone any foreigner. This was largely acquired during his long years in France and refreshed by visits at every opportunity subsequently. There was a long tradition of local erudition by local worthies in France; there had also been substantial scholarly monographs devoted to a department or particular region. It was Cobb who first brought this local perspective to underpin a broad sweep of national history across France.<br>
<br>The theme of Cobb's writing was popular history. He belonged to the group of historians at the time in Europe who were concerned with &#145;history from the bottom up&#146;. However, he was clearly distinguished from them. He was a historian of the people by temperament and not by ideology. Indeed, it is extremely difficult to discover any theoretical basis to any of his writing. He was simply not interested in the debates about the social interpretation of the French Revolution or mentalities or political culture that divided historians in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.<br>
<br>What shines through Cobb's historical writing is an intense intimacy with the individuals who form his subject matter. He had no particular historical method other than to listen to the voices of people through a great quantity of manuscript records, often police reports and interrogations, that he read assiduously. He had an exceptional empathy with the poor and the marginal in society; he had an exceptional ability to understand and capture their angers, their derision, their private concerns and rhythms of life, their personal joys and tragedies. Unlike others writing on this subject, he understood that the Revolution was not necessarily the most important event in their lives. Finally, he wrote with strong directness, full of the voices of his subjects who were given a vivid physical context. Cobb had a strong and detailed sense of place, a gift for atmosphere, and a talent for prose.<br>
<br>Cobb's greatest influence was upon a generation of postgraduate students from the United Kingdom and North America at Oxford. They learned the value of the provincial history of the period, the importance of large-scale reading of manuscript archives at all levels, and the necessity of a real enthusiasm for France. This was a new direction in the historiography of the French Revolution. It cannot be said that Cobb created a school of history. His work was basically unrepeatable, given life by his own intimate relationship with it, too devoid of engagement with matters of interpretation.<br>
<br>Cobb's most formal scholarly work (<span class="italic">Les arm&eacute;es r&eacute;volutionnaires</span>) was devoted to the most insubordinate and temporary of all the institutions of the French Revolution (the popular political armies of the interior). His work moved increasingly towards a concern with marginal individuals or groups and those outside society. Such figures are the least documented, only momentarily visible. This must have contributed to an apparently growing frustration with the contradiction between the essential unknowability of individuals in the past and his desire for intimacy with his subjects. These preoccupations are evident and unresolved in his last monograph, based on the inventories of Paris suicides in the 1790s (<span class="italic">Death in Paris</span>).<br>
<br>It is perhaps for this reason that Cobb turned to writing autobiographical essays and memoirs&#151;principally <span class="italic">Still Life</span> (1983), <span class="italic">A Classical Education</span> (1985), <span class="italic">Something to Hold on to</span> (1988), and <span class="italic">The End of the Line</span> (1997). This genre allowed him to display to a high level all his talents for detail, sense of place and atmosphere, his quick sense of the absurd, and his capacity for compassion allied to derision in the face of pomposity and self-importance. These books brought him a considerable general readership. Certainly, <span class="italic">Still Life</span> is an enduring classic among middle-class memoirs.<br>
<br>Much of the power of Cobb's writing, whether historical or other, derived from the force and complexity of his personality. It is impossible to situate him in any political terms. He belonged essentially to the long tradition of English radical individualism. Temperamentally, he was insubordinate and had a quick dislike of authority, particularly that assumed with rank or office. Yet, at the same time, he had great respect for institutions, especially venerable ones, and enthusiasm for membership of them. He had also a liking for badges of rank. He delighted in the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and was always disappointed when someone else wearing the distinctive red ribbon in the lapel did not give a sign of recognition of their mutual distinction.<br>
<br>Indeed, Cobb saw the world very much in terms of persons, not of hierarchies or social bonds or ideas. He was curious, inquisitive, and quick to judge. Dismissive of cant, pomposity, and moralizing (he was deeply antagonistic to Robespierre&#151;and, hence, to dogs which Robespierre liked), he gave himself to numerous, diverse, and enduring friendships. His correspondence with friends was voluminous and a direct, vivid outpouring of opinions and narratives of the moment. He prized fidelity in friendship. Yet, he could on occasion rupture relationships irrevocably in one burst of passionate anger. Cobb lived an intensely sociable life, though it was never allowed to interfere with regular daily habits of research and writing. He loved rather schoolboy pranks and the company of students, as well as of like-minded colleagues. Lavish and prolonged evenings in common room and pub echoed similar releases of high spirits in Paris.<br>
<br>The French saw Cobb as a Jacobin. However, his very English individualism did not translate into such institutionalized radicalism. He was not much concerned with the approval or disapproval of anyone. Indeed, this tension of cultures ran beneath his apparently complete absorption into France. France provided him with a second identity, as the title of one of his books put it. Revealed first perhaps by his choice of long-distance running as a means of securing a secret life at boarding-school, Cobb needed a separate world to step into. History certainly provided this for him. He lived with an imaginative landscape activated by memories, people, situations, history, and even place names. It was not the least of his complexities that such a sociable temperament should have co-existed with such a private other world of imagination.<br>
