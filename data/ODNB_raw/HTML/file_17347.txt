<span class="headword">Macaulay,  Zachary</span>  (1768&#150;1838), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 2 May 1768 in Inveraray, the third son of the twelve children of <a name="cosubject_17347"></a><span class="headword">John Macaulay</span>  (1720&#150;1789), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, and his second wife, Margaret(<i>d</i>. 1790), daughter of Colin Campbell of Inveresragan. John Macaulay was the eldest son of Angus Macaulay, and was minister successively of South Uist (1746), Lismore (1756), Inveraray (1765), and Cardross (1775). He dined with Samuel Johnson and suffered his anger during Boswell and Johnson's journey to Scotland in October 1773. Aside from Zachary, the other children from his second marriage included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17343/', "Aulay Macaulay")</script> and Colin (1760&#150;1836), who served in the Indian army and at Seringapatam, was imprisoned along with Sir David Baird by Haidar Ali, and served as MP for Saltash from 1828 to 1830. Promoted to the rank of major-general in August 1830 and subsequently lieutenant-general, Colin Macaulay died at Clifton on 20 February 1836. John Macaulay died on 30 March 1789.<br>
<br>Given only a rudimentary education, Zachary Macaulay taught himself Latin and Greek and read the English classics voraciously. At fourteen he went to work in a merchant's office in Glasgow. Here, according to an autobiographical fragment which he wrote in 1797, he fell in with a group of university students who undermined his faith and indulged his passion for conversation and debate. Urged on by his colleagues at the counting-house, he also started to drink excessively.<br>
<br>At the end of 1784 Macaulay obviously suffered some kind of personal embarrassment, although the precise details are unclear. To escape the &#145;labyrinth&#146; in which he found himself he determined to go abroad. Not yet seventeen, he took up a position as an under-manager or bookkeeper on a sugar plantation in Jamaica. Initially repulsed by the sights he saw around him, not least the violence of the slave system, he soon adapted to his new surroundings and by his own account became &#145;callous and indifferent&#146;. Nevertheless, he kept up his languages (Horace, he said, was his constant companion), moderated his drinking, and, as he had in Glasgow, proved himself to be a more than capable worker. In fact, he became a &#145;prodigy&#146; among bookkeepers. Despite his protestations, he also took an interest in the welfare of the slaves.<br>
<br>Macaulay returned to Britain in 1789, lured by the offer of a position from an uncle in London. Soon after his arrival he went to stay with his sister Jean, who in 1787 had married Thomas Babington, a country gentleman who owned Rothley Temple in Leicestershire. The visit was to change his life. Babington was a young man of strong evangelical views, and under his influence Macaulay's better nature began to assert itself. At some point during his time at Rothley Temple he underwent a conversion experience and, as a result, he became an intimate of Babington and his circle, which included Henry Thornton and William Wilberforce.<br>
<br>Through his association with Babington, Macaulay was invited to visit Sierra Leone, the west African colony founded in 1787 to provide a home for emancipated slaves. Setting sail at the end of 1790 he did not see his friends again until the spring of 1792. No sooner had he returned to Britain than he was sent out again to Sierra Leone, this time as one of the council members. In March 1794 he became governor. A tireless and painstaking administrator, Macaulay steered the colony through a difficult period in its short history. Undeterred by a hostile environment and disputes among the settlers, he opened trade negotiations with the Fula kingdom and in September 1794 successfully resisted an invasion by French revolutionary forces. When he handed over the governorship in 1799 the capital, Freetown, was a bustling settlement of some 1200 inhabitants and the centre of a considerable trade with the interior.<br>
<br>On 26 August 1799 Macaulay married Selina Mills (<i>d</i>. 1831), the daughter of Thomas Mills, a Bristol bookseller. The couple, who had been introduced by their mutual friend Hannah More, eventually settled in Clapham, Surrey, where they raised their nine children, five daughters and four sons born between 1800 and 1814. To support himself Macaulay became secretary to the Sierra Leone Company, a position he held until 1808, when the colony was transferred to the British crown. It was not long, however, before he became absorbed in philanthropic endeavours, chief among them being the campaign to abolish the slave trade. Macaulay, of course, had direct personal experience of the trade, both in the West Indies and on the west coast of Africa, and it was this experience that he brought to bear on the early nineteenth-century abolitionist movement.<br>
<br>In 1804 Macaulay was elected a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which had only recently been revived by William Wilberforce. He quickly emerged as a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign which in 1807 resulted in victory for Wilberforce and his supporters. Throughout these proceedings Macaulay worked in the background, collecting information, drafting reports, and assisting his friends in the House of Commons. A brilliant statistician blessed with a prodigious memory, Macaulay had a rare gift for being able to master and abridge the most intractable sources. He was also scrupulously fair and accurate. When information was required Wilberforce would say, &#145;Look it out in Macaulay&#146;  (Booth, 65).<br>
<br>After 1807 Macaulay played a major part in trying to ensure that the new legislation was enforced and that other European countries followed Britain's example. He became honorary secretary of the African Institution, which replaced the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and, following his resignation in 1812, continued to serve on the committee. In 1814, during the temporary peace in Europe, he travelled to Paris to present the British case for abolition of the slave trade by the continental powers. Macaulay was also in regular contact with the duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh at the congress of Vienna (1815), and with them fought unsuccessfully to block French efforts to revive the slave trade in those parts of Africa where it had already been suppressed. It was later said that Macaulay was the only one of the &#145;saints&#146; whom Wellington liked.<br>
<br>By the early 1820s Macaulay was contemplating a more direct attack on West Indian planters, namely the gradual abolition of slavery itself. In 1823 he helped to organize the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96359', "Anti-Slavery Society")</script> and became editor of its monthly publication, the <span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Reporter</span>. Through the pages of the <span class="italic">Reporter</span> and pamphlets such as <span class="italic">East and West India Sugar</span> (1823) and <span class="italic">Negro Slavery</span> (1824), both of which were published anonymously, Macaulay sought to reveal the true enormities of the slave system and to counter claims that conditions in the West Indies had actually improved. In doing so, he provided Thomas Foxwell Buxton and his colleagues with the evidence on which they could take their stand in the Commons. For the most part Macaulay preferred to work behind the scenes. Even so, he was frequently the target of scurrilous attacks by pro-slavery interests, notably in the periodical <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, all of which he resisted with patience and great courage.<br>
<br>Macaulay and his colleagues focused their attention on working through parliament. As time went on, however, the ideas and methods of the Anti-Slavery Society came under increasing pressure from young men like George Stephen who favoured taking the campaign out into the country. The result was the agency committee, organized in 1831. Like many conservatives within the movement, Macaulay looked askance at the populist appeal of the committee, its revivalist tone, and its support for the immediate abolition of slavery. Nevertheless, he assisted the new organization and gave it his tacit support.<br>
<br>Macaulay was also involved in a number of other philanthropic endeavours. He helped to start the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, the official organ of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42140', "Clapham Sect")</script>, and served as its editor from 1802 to 1816. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and an active member of the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Church Missionary Society, and the Society for the Suppression of Vice. He also found time to promote Sunday and infant schools. Macaulay took a keen interest in educational movements; he supported Andrew Bell's claim to be the originator of the monitorial system, for instance, and was one of the principal founders of the University of London.<br>
<br>These various activities, and the many demands on his time, undoubtedly had an adverse effect on Macaulay's business interests. Soon after he stepped down as secretary of the Sierra Leone Company he started a business of his own, trading with Africa and the East Indies. He also acted as an agent for captains and shipowners seeking compensation, usually in the form of prize money, for their part in the suppression of the slave trade. By 1818 Macaulay was reputed to be worth &pound;100,000. But then disaster struck. In 1823 he handed over control of his trading company to his nephew, Thomas Babington, who proved unequal to the task. It soon became apparent that what had once been a thriving business was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1828 the family was forced to move from Cadogan Place into smaller premises in Great Ormond Street. Macaulay's financial circumstances steadily worsened, so much so that in 1834 he was exiled to Paris. With the help of his son Henry all of his debts were liquidated but the business was wound up and Macaulay spent the last years of his life in lodgings in Clarges Street, London.<br>
<br>Macaulay had been born with a defect in one eye and as a boy suffered a serious accident to his right arm which required extensive surgery. He was repeatedly ill in Jamaica and his health broke down again in Sierra Leone, probably from overwork. In later life his financial embarrassments also took their toll. Macaulay died at Clarges Street on 13 May 1838 and was buried in Mecklenburgh Square, London. At a meeting held on 30 July 1838, with Sir Thomas Foxwell Buxton in the chair, it was agreed to erect a memorial to Macaulay in Westminster Abbey. The bust, which was designed and executed by Henry Weekes, incorporates a figure of a kneeling slave together with the motto &#145;Am I not a Man and a Brother?&#146;<br>
<br>An intense, tenacious, and imperturbable man, Macaulay holds an important place in the history of British anti-slavery. His was not a particularly glamorous role. But through calm and reasoned argument Macaulay laid the foundations for the campaign that would lead in 1834 to the abolition of slavery throughout Britain's colonial possessions. Nothing escaped his notice. He was the perfect foil to firebrands like James Stephen and did as much as anyone to give the anti-slavery movement intellectual respectability. Macaulay was a demanding husband and parent, whose stern moralism inevitably caused friction, not least with his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17349/', "Thomas Babington Macaulay")</script>. Nevertheless, the family remained close-knit.<br>
