<span class="headword">Stone,  George</span>  (1708&#150;1764), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born on 7 January 1708 at his father's house, the Grasshopper, 68 Lombard Street, London, and baptized on 11 February at St Mary Woolnoth, the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48246/', "Andrew Stone (d. 1711)")</script>, an eminent banker, and his wife, Anne Holbrooke (<i>d</i>. 1725). He had three sisters; his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26565/', "Andrew Stone (1703&#150;1773)")</script> was later tutor to the future George III. From 1720 he was educated at Westminster School, where at thirteen he was elected a king's scholar at Whitsuntide 1721. On 2 June 1725 he obtained a Westminster studentship at Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated BA on 7 May 1729, MA on 10 May 1732, and DD (by diploma) on 20 May 1740. It was either the army or the church for Stone, and while at Oxford he took holy orders.<br>
<br>On the appointment, in June 1730, of the duke of Dorset as lord lieutenant of Ireland, Stone went over to Dublin as one of his chaplains. His rise in the church was remarkably rapid. He was appointed dean of Ferns, by patent dated 22 August 1733. On 11 March 1734 he was promoted to the deanery of Derry and was installed on the following 3 April. On 3 August 1740 he was consecrated bishop of Ferns and Leighlin by the archbishop of Dublin, assisted by the bishops of Meath and Derry, in the parish church of Chapelizod, near Dublin. He took his seat in the House of Lords, for the first time, on 6 October 1741. He was translated to the bishopric of Kildare, by patent dated 19 March 1743, and in the same month was installed dean of Christ Church, Dublin. On 11 May 1745 he was translated to the bishopric of Derry, whereupon he resigned the deanery of Christ Church. He was appointed archbishop of Armagh, by patent dated 13 March 1747, and took his seat on the archbishops' bench in the Irish House of Lords on the following 6 October, but he was not enthroned until 26 September 1752.<br>
<br>Stone's career within the Church of Ireland did not take precedence over his more controversial political life. He owed his rise to political and not religious figures, like the dukes of Dorset and Newcastle. Nor did he reside much in Armagh, with the exception of irregular visitations, though he was archbishop there for seventeen years. He was not an evangelical prelate but he did preach to the Charter School society three times during the 1740s. His views on Catholics are not easy to read from his correspondence or from the four printed anniversary sermons (1741, 1742, 1751, and 1760). His opposition in 1756 and 1757 to the bills that were proposed for registering Catholic clergy could be a sign of dislike of persecution or of concern about legally recognizing the priests. Similarly, with regard to Irish dissenters Stone has not left convincing evidence of his views. It might be safe to assume that he was a bishop in touch with Erastian whig ideas of the time, much more so than earlier Church of Ireland primates like archbishops William King or Hugh Boulter. Stone's political prelacy was not that unusual for Ireland, and the attacks on this new Wolsey could as easily have been made about King or Boulter.<br>
<br>Stone was sworn of the Irish privy council on 10 April 1747 and on the same day was appointed a lord justice, for the first of many times, with Robert Jocelyn, Baron Newport, the lord chancellor, and Henry Boyle, speaker of the House of Commons. Though Stone had already on several occasions &#145;signalised himself by a most determined opposition to the Irish interest&#146;  (F. Plowden, <span class="italic">An Historical Review of the State of Ireland</span>, 1803, 1.304) he was careful not to express openly his political ambitions during the viceroyalty of Lord Harrington. A rivalry, however, soon sprang up between the young primate and Boyle, who had been for a long time one of the most powerful men in Ireland. Stone was cultivating a majority in the Irish parliament, based on the Ponsonby following, government officials, and ambitious MPs, to challenge Boyle's ascendancy. The hope was that the old speaker would quietly retire. On the reappointment of his former patron, the first duke of Dorset, as lord lieutenant in 1751 Stone allied himself with Lord George Sackville, the new chief secretary. This alliance, combined with the influence of his elder brother Andrew Stone at court in London, enabled him more effectually to contest the supremacy of his rivals in Ireland. The contest between Stone and Boyle was not merely for power but soon involved a wider constitutional question about the powers and status of the Irish House of Commons. The issue that focused minds was whether the house had or had not the right to dispose of the surplus revenues of the country. Stone supported the claim of the crown, while Boyle, who had been driven into opposition by Lord George Sackville's attempt to induce him to resign the speakership in favour of John Ponsonby, took the patriot side. In the session of 1749 heads of a bill for the appropriation of the surplus were sent over to England, but while the English ministers insisted that the surplus belonged to the crown they did not force the issue, to avoid embarrassing the viceroy, Lord Harrington. In order to establish the ministerial position Dorset, at the opening of the session in 1751, declared the royal consent to the proposed measure. The house, however, passed the bill without taking any notice of this consent. When the bill was returned from England with an alteration in the preamble signifying that the royal consent had been given the Irish parliament gave way and the bill was passed in its altered form. The struggle was renewed in the session of 1753, and the money bill was returned from England with the same alteration as before. By this time the opposition to Dorset's administration had grown stronger and the bill was rejected by the Irish House of Commons, on account of the alteration, by a majority of 122 votes against 117. Hereupon strong measures were taken by the government; Anthony Malone, Boyle, and other servants of the crown who had voted with the majority were dismissed from their places, and a portion of the surplus was by royal authority applied to the liquidation of the national debt.<br>
<br>With Boyle's dismissal Stone and his Ponsonby allies took up the reins of power in early 1754. The next twelve months saw perhaps the most savage personal abuse to be aimed at a public figure in Ireland during the Georgian era. Stone became the target of vicious patriot attacks for being a representative of the &#145;English interest&#146;, which the patriots believed was designed to destroy Ireland and its parliament; for his political ambition, which was seen as worse than that of Laud or Wolsey; and for his alleged homosexuality. The last accusation gave the struggle between Dublin Castle and the patriots a distinctly personal edge, which often hid the constitutional and political issues involved. Worse for Stone was that by the spring of 1755 the patriots seemed to be gaining ground, despite their lack of power or government patronage. With the prospect of war with France and the death of Henry Pelham, Dorset's removal became inevitable and he was dismissed in February 1755. His replacement, William Cavendish, soon to become fourth duke of Devonshire, turned the tables on Stone. Boyle was created earl of Shannon, and several members of the opposition received places or pensions, while Stone lost his central role in the Irish government; however, though he was excluded from the regency in May 1756 he was not struck off the list of Irish privy councillors.<br>
<br>Aiming to regain power Stone now entered into an alliance with John Ponsonby in opposition to the government of the duke of Bedford. The House of Commons was at this time divided into four parties, led respectively by Stone, John Ponsonby, the earl of Shannon, and the earl of Kildare. Despite his wish to favour Kildare, in the session of 1757 Bedford was to find that he could not rule through one party alone. The rump of the patriot opposition was also able to find enough willing allies among the discontented followers of Stone and Ponsonby to embarrass the government. In addition Stone had spent much of early 1757 in London and had become the architect of the Pitt&#150;Newcastle coalition, which created the first stable ministry since 1754. Thus the primate's star was in the ascendant, and in January 1758 Bedford totally reversed his earlier plans and made Stone, Ponsonby, and Shannon his lords justices. By the end of the parliamentary session it was clear that Stone's return to government had ensured a working majority in the Commons. This continued for the next three sessions, with Stone clearly the leading undertaker of Dublin Castle's legislation. Successive viceroys after 1758 had to rely on Stone's advice about proposed legislation. He was also to become the main channel of patronage from the castle, not only in the church but in the army and judiciary as well. The secret of his success after his return to power was his total abandonment of earlier political ideas and tactics. Gone were his complaints that the Irish government was being undermined by a cabal of undertakers and that the &#145;English interest&#146; needed to be reinforced. Instead Stone was a careful negotiator between Irish expectations (on economic, patronage, and constitutional issues) and what the ministry in London would tolerate. In one case, during a crisis over a money bill in December 1760, he stood on the brink of dismissal before ministers chose to side with him rather than the viceroy, Bedford. In terms of tactics Stone never sought to alienate the other Irish politicians as he had done in 1747&#150;54. After 1758 he co-operated closely with Ponsonby and Shannon and did not even seek to marginalize his old enemy Kildare. Patronage was shared more evenly and Stone's ascendancy was more that of first among equals.<br>
<br>Stone, who never married, died of gout at his brother's house in Privy Garden (now known as Whitehall Gardens), London, on 19 December 1764, aged fifty-six. After lying in state in the Jerusalem chamber he was buried in Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey on 28 December.<br>
