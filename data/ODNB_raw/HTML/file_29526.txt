<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  John Bickerton</span>  (1792&#150;1855), <span class="occ">nonconformist memorialist</span>, son of William Williams of Broseley, Shropshire, and his wife, Hannah, daughter of John Bickerton, was born on 4 March 1792 at Sandford Hall, West Felton, Shropshire; he was a collateral relative of the family of the seventeenth-century nonconformist divines Philip and Matthew Henry. His parents moved to Wem, Shropshire, early in his life, and there he was educated and articled to an attorney. Between 1811 and 1815 he lived in Liverpool, and in 1816 was admitted an attorney at Shrewsbury, where he went into practice. On 31 August 1819 he was admitted a burgess. On 27 December 1813 he married at Aston, near Birmingham, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of Josiah Robins of Birmingham. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From an early age Williams was deeply religious and became a member of the Wem Congregational Church in 1809. He began to form a collection of manuscripts by the Henrys and other theologians of their school, and devoted his leisure to writing. His first publication was <span class="italic">Eighteen Sermons of the Rev. Philip Henry, M.A., from Original Manuscripts</span> (1816). This was followed in 1818 by a memoir of Henry's daughter Sarah Savage, which, in its 1821 edition, included a memoir of her sister, Ann Hulton. Memoirs of Philip Henry (1825) and Matthew Henry (1828) followed&#151;the latter was frequently reprinted&#151;along with several other works on the Henry family. A regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Congregational Magazine</span>, Williams also published a memoir of Sir Matthew Hale (1835) and two series of <span class="italic">Letters on Puritanism and Nonconformity</span> (1843 and 1846).<br>
<br>After the passing of the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> of 1835, Williams was elected an alderman of Shrewsbury, and in November 1836 became mayor, the first dissenter so appointed. In this capacity he presented an address to the duke of Sussex, and this introduction to the duke led to a friendship based on their mutual literary interests. To this friendship he owed the knighthood bestowed on 19 July 1837 by Queen Victoria, the first of her reign. He was elected FSA in 1824 and a fellow of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838. In 1831 he received the degree of LLD from Middleburg College, Vermont.<br>
<br>Williams retired from his legal practice in March 1841 and went to reside at The Hall, Wem, where he died on 21 October 1855. He was buried in the cemetery in Chapel Street, Wem, on 27 October; his funeral sermon was preached by John Angell James on 4 November.<br>
