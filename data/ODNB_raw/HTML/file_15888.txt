<span class="headword">Laing,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1483), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Glasgow</span>, came of the family of Laing of Redhouse, Edinburghshire. He was appointed rector of Tannadice in Angus and vicar of Linlithgow, and by the beginning of 1474 he was rector of Newlands in the diocese of Glasgow. He was also involved in secular government. Described in a charter of 1463 as secretary to Mary of Gueldres, the widowed queen of James II, he had become royal treasurer by 17 September 1470 and held that office at least until his provision to Glasgow, and probably afterwards&#151;he cannot be shown to have been replaced until 29 May 1476. In addition he was clerk register in 1473. Following the death of Andrew Durisdeer, bishop of Glasgow, on 20 November 1473 Laing was provided to the see on 28 January 1474, when Sixtus IV referred to him as councillor to the king of Scots. Laing may earlier have shared in the disquiet created in the Scottish church by the elevation of Patrick Graham to metropolitan status at St Andrews in 1472, particularly since one of his own benefices was granted for the maintenance of the archbishop's household.<br>
<br>In 1476 Laing founded a Franciscan friary in Glasgow. Two years later James III confirmed Laing's grants of land and tenements in Edinburgh to St Kentigern, Glasgow Cathedral, and the altar of St Duthac in the church of St Giles, Edinburgh. A further grant, made on 9 February 1482, gave the rent from two booths in Edinburgh to pay for 6 stones of wax yearly for candles for the choir of Glasgow Cathedral. The crisis precipitated by the seizure of James III by members of the Scottish nobility in July 1482 led to abrupt changes in government, and Laing had replaced Andrew Stewart, Lord Avondale, as chancellor by 25 August. Laing's long record of service to the crown as a councillor, witnessing royal charters from 1470 onwards, meant that he was not too closely identified with the unpopular James III, and consequently his appointment as chancellor would seem to have been acceptable to both the king and his opponents. During the crisis of 1482&#150;3 he was the nominal head of an administration which rejected William Scheves, archbishop of St Andrews; as a particular favourite of James III, Scheves was resented by the wider political community, frustrated by what it saw as its exclusion from royal policy making. Laing held the position of chancellor of Scotland until his death on 11 January 1483, when he was succeeded in office by Bishop James Livingston of Dunkeld.<br>
