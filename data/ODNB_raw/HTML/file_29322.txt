<span class="headword">Whitson,  John</span>  (1553<span class="mult">x</span>5?&#150;1629), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born at Clearwell in the parish of Newland, Gloucestershire. Described by his godson John Aubrey as &#145;a handsome young fellow&#146; and an early riser who transacted all business before noon, he was a keen falconer  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 317). In 1570 he was apprenticed to the wealthy Bristol vintner Nicholas Cutt, whose young widow, Bridget, he later allegedly seduced in a wine cellar; he married her on 12 April 1585. Admitted a freeman of Bristol in that same year, Whitson soon became an important merchant, trading mainly to France, Spain, and the Mediterranean, principally in lead, cloth, and leather in return for wine, currants, and alum. During the 1590s he was a member of a syndicate which fitted out two privateers, apparently donating the proceeds from his share of two enemy prizes to various Bristol almshouses. He was accused of customs fraud in 1600, and in 1623 was found guilty by the exchequer of failing to pay prisage on wine. In 1603 he provided much of the financial backing for Martin Pring's voyage to North America. Along with other Bristol merchants he seceded from the newly revived Spanish Company in December 1605 in order to resuscitate the town's Society of Merchant Venturers, which he served as warden in 1605&#150;6 and master in 1606&#150;7 and 1611&#150;12. Between 1611 and 1622 he also acted as a deputy's deputy in the farm of the wine customs, but confusion over the payment of his annual rent of &pound;1400 led to a lengthy exchequer suit.<br>
<br>According to Aubrey, Whitson &#145;lived nobly; kept a plentiful table; and was the most popular magistrate&#146; in Bristol  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 317); his house in St Nicholas Street allegedly boasted &#145;the stateliest dining room in the city&#146;. Sheriff of Bristol in 1589&#150;90, he was elected alderman of All Saints' ward in 1600, and served as mayor in 1603&#150;4 and 1615&#150;16, an auditor in 1628, constable of the staple on six occasions, and colonel of the local militia. During his first term as mayor, he was prosecuted by the collector of sums paid to compound for purveyance in Bristol, but escaped punishment by the board of greencloth because his presence in Bristol during time of plague could not be spared. In November 1605 he was returned to parliament for Bristol at a by-election, subsequently representing the town in the assemblies of 1614, 1621, 1625, and 1626, but playing a minor role in proceedings.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, Bridget, in 1608, Whitson married on 21 April 1609 Magdalen Hynde, the beautiful but near penniless widow of a London salter, William Hynde; she died in 1615. He married his third wife, Rachel Aubrey (<i>d</i>. 1654), on 18 May 1617. The widow of a Herefordshire gentleman, John Aubrey, her dowry is said to have amounted to &pound;2000. In November 1626 Whitson was stabbed by a litigant while dispensing justice in Bristol, leaving a scar on his cheek. He subsequently wrote <span class="italic">The Aged Christian's Final Farewell to the World</span>, first published in 1829, in which he condemned the amassing of wealth as &#145;the idols of earthly minds&#146;. He died in Bristol on 27 February 1629, after falling from his horse, &#145;his head pitching on a nail that stood on its head by a smith's shop&#146;, and was buried with full military honours at a cost of &pound;377 on 9 March in St Nicholas's, Bristol. He left no direct heirs; his three daughters from his first marriage had all predeceased him, and his second and third marriages had proved childless. He therefore left a considerable part of his estate for charitable purposes, which included the foundation of the Red Maids' School in Bristol. After discounting debts amounting to &pound;3000, an inventory made on 1 June 1629 valued his estate at more than &pound;5400, though subsequent litigation demonstrated that a number of properties had not been included in this valuation.<br>
