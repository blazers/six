<span class="headword">Pratt, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 2 November 1620, at Marsworth, Buckinghamshire, the son of the lawyer Gregory Pratt (<i>d</i>. 1640) and his wife, Theodosia West (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Tyrell). He was the nephew of Francis, the holder of the family seat at Ryston, near Downham, Norfolk. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 12 May 1637, and entered the Inner Temple in 1639. His father died in 1640, leaving him an estate which produced a small income which enabled him to travel from 1643 until 1649 in France, Italy (where he met John Evelyn, the diarist), Flanders, and the Netherlands, avoiding the civil war and to &#145;give myself some convenient education&#146;  (Gunther, 3). Although he matriculated in the faculty of law at Padua in 1645 and upon his return to Britain kept chambers at the Inner Temple until 1672, his travels laid the foundation not for a legal but for an architectural career, for which he was rewarded by a knighthood in 1668.<br>
<br>Although Roger Pratt has been characterized as a gentleman architect, which suggests to the modern reader an element of the dilettante, his approach, in the early days of the development of the architectural profession, was analytical, practical, and systematic. His essays on architecture and building, drawing on both continental and English experience and unpublished in his own day, were written principally in 1660 and 1665, possibly with the intention of publication as a treatise. They show him taking pains to master all aspects of the design process and building practice, as well as advertising his own experience. He advises prospective builders first to<blockquote>resolve with yourself what house will be answerable to your purse and estate &hellip; then if you be not able to handsomely contrive it yourself, get some ingenious gentleman who has seen much of that kind abroad and been somewhat versed in the best authors of Architecture: viz. Palladio, Scamozzi, Serlio etc. to do it for you, and to give you a design of it in paper. (Gunther, 60)</blockquote>Pratt's particular interest lay in planning and the organization of circulation. In his five known houses, built over a period of only fifteen years, he sought to effect a balance between large and small rooms, grand staircases and discreet backstairs, public display and private function, within an arrangement both symmetrical and hierarchical. Coleshill, Berkshire (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;62; dem. 1952), astonishing in its assurance and repose as the first known work of the architect, represents the supreme example of the double-pile house, two ranges deep, a form which had been popular in England throughout the seventeenth century, which Pratt particularly recommended as convenient and economical since &#145;it seems of all others to be the most useful &hellip; for that we have there much room in a little compass &hellip; and there may be a great spare of walling&#146;  (Gunther, 24). But Coleshill was never an exemplar, and in a house of this size economy was a relative concept: this was a pre-eminent and inimitable work of art. Pratt did not invent features at Coleshill but brought together elements which were already part of the currency of European domestic architecture: the rooftop platform and cupola, dormered attics, half-sunk basement, astylar elevation, and symmetrically placed apartments. The house was the more remarkable for the beauty of its fa&ccedil;ade, the grandeur of its two-storey staircase hall and the provision of central corridors on all floors which enabled rapid and effective progress, separating suites of apartments from each other and avoiding the use of private rooms as through-rooms.<br>
<br>Coleshill's answer to the problem of preventing accidental contact between family, visitors, and servants, a matter of some concern to architects of the later seventeenth century, was atypical: Pratt did not repeat his uncompromising corridors. His three principal later houses presented different planning solutions. Kingston Lacy, Dorset (1663&#150;5; altered 1835&#150;41), and Horseheath Hall, Cambridgeshire (1663&#150;5; dem. 1792), had tripartite plans with a central two-storey hall, large stair compartments to each end, and self-contained apartments at the angles. At Horseheath the circulation was severely restricted by the inclusion of a chapel in one corner. Clarendon House, Piccadilly, London (1664&#150;7; dem. 1683), built for Edward Hyde, was Pratt's greatest commission and his most influential and copyable design. This larger house represented a summation of the planning developments of the previous fifty years. Here Pratt combined aspects of his own earlier plans, a central double-pile with grand staircases at each end, and pavilions at each corner disposed in a manner premonitory of the grander houses of the later seventeenth century: Belton House, Lincolnshire, is the most notable of the Clarendon derivatives. John Evelyn, who referred to Pratt as &#145;my old acquaintance at Rome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 360), expressed qualified approval, finding &#145;my L:Chancellors new Palace&#146;  (ibid., 488), when almost complete, &#145;a goodly pile to see &hellip; but had many defects as to the Architecture&#146;  (ibid., 503). Evelyn does not specify the problems, but one of them may have been the increase in size without a commensurate increase in scale. Clarendon, with a single-storey hall, was internally less inventive and spatially complex than the earlier houses in which Pratt had fitted single-storey rooms around a two-storey hall, and in adding the pavilions he risked monotony by increasing the frontage from nine to fifteen equally spaced bays. Clarendon was a handsome and important house, but its fa&ccedil;ade bore no comparison with the rhythms of Coleshill, and its plan offered few surprises. In the opinion of Roger North, it was &#145;without one large or good room, as one would expect in so great a fabrick&#146;  (Colvin and Newman, 77).<br>
<br>While engaged in private practice, Pratt was involved in an official capacity in advising the commissioners for the repair of St Paul's Cathedral, shortly before the great fire of 1666. After the fire he was (with Sir Christopher Wren and Hugh May) one of the three commissioners appointed by the king to supervise the rebuilding of the City, in which capacity he urged the formation of wider streets. In 1668 he married Ann (1643&#150;1706), daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Monins bt, of Waldershare in Kent, and the following year began for himself the rebuilding of Ryston Hall, Norfolk, on the estate which he had inherited from his cousin Edward, who had died in 1664. This, his last recorded house (1669&#150;72; remodelled 1787&#150;8), built to a double-pile plan, was distinguished by a whimsical, segmentally pedimented centrepiece of French derivation, crowned by a small turret.<br>
<br>Pratt's later years were spent in leading the life of a country gentleman. He died at Ryston on 20 February 1685 and was buried in the parish church. His three sons, Roger, Monins, and Theodore, all predeceased him and the estate passed to Edward Pratt, a descendant of Sir Roger's great-grandfather. His widow then married Sigismund Trafford of Lincolnshire, who erected a monument at Ryston to her memory upon her death in 1706.<br>
<br>Pratt's portrait by Sir Peter Lely is preserved at Ryston along with his manuscript notebooks, not only on architecture, which were published by R. T. Gunther in 1928, but also on his later enthusiasms, farming and estate management. Although he did not leave a school of architecture behind him, Sir Roger Pratt has a significant place in English architectural history as the author of the notebooks which, together with those of Roger North, provide us with the most informed commentary on the domestic architecture of the period; as the designer of the short-lived but influential Clarendon House, a building of great typological significance in the development of the English country house; and as the architect of one unique masterpiece, Coleshill.<br>
