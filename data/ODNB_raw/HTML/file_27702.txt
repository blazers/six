</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trench,  Richard Chenevix</span>  (1807&#150;1886), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born on 9 September 1807 at North Frederick Street, Dublin, the third son of Richard Trench (1774&#150;1860), barrister-at-law (brother of Frederic Trench, first Baron Ashtown) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27700/', "Melesina Trench (1768&#150;1827)")</script>, granddaughter of Richard Chenevix, bishop of Waterford. His childhood was spent at Elm Lodge, Burlesdon, near Southampton, purchased by his father in 1810. He attended Twyford School (1816&#150;19) and Harrow School (1819&#150;25), proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1825. He took pride in his membership of the Apostles there, and came under the influence of F. D. Maurice and a distinguished group of undergraduates that included Tennyson and Arthur Hallam. While at Trinity he edited and printed a periodical, <span class="italic">The Translator</span>. He graduated BA in 1829, and proceeded MA in 1833 and BD in 1850.<br>
<br>Trench spent the period immediately following graduation travelling in Europe, much of it in Spain, for whose literature he had developed a passion. He returned home in mid-1830, only to return to Spain within months as part of the somewhat quixotic Torrijos expedition, a group of idealistic volunteers who set out to attack Cadiz in support of the ill-conceived and ineptly executed liberal revolution of Jos&eacute; Torrijos, and from which Trench returned unscathed if somewhat embarrassed.<br>
<br>By 1831 his father had taken up residence at Bockley Park, near Stradbally, in Queen's county (co. Laois), where Trench spent much time. On 31 May 1832 he married his cousin Frances Mary Trench (1809&#150;1890), daughter of Francis Trench of Sopwell Hall in co. Tipperary and Mary, daughter of Henry Mason of Shrewsbury. They had seven sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Trench was ordained deacon in Norwich Cathedral on 7 October 1832, and in 1833 took up the curacy of Hadleigh in Suffolk, under the Tractarian Hugh James Rose, expressing himself glad &#145;to be quit of Ireland&#146;, which was experiencing a period of particular turbulence, largely to do with popular resistance to the payment of tithes to the established church. None the less, in 1847, when the great Irish famine was at its worst, he joined his cousin Frederic Fitzwilliam Trench, rector of Cloughjordan, in relief work, succumbing to fever immediately on his return to England. Years later, as archbishop of Dublin, he was to show himself equally compassionate and energetic during an economic crisis caused by the harvest failure of 1879&#150;80. During the time of Trench's curacy, the Hadleigh conference took place in the parish, attended by Froude and other Tractarian clergy, and convened by Rose to consider the threat that he perceived to lie in the <span class="roman">(Irish) Church Temporalities Bill</span>, famously condemned in Keble's &#145;assize sermon&#146; of 1833.<br>
<br>Rose left that same year for the professorship of divinity at the newly founded University of Durham, and some months later (1834) Trench became curate of St Peter's, Colchester. Ill health soon compelled him to resign. He, his wife, and their daughter (Melesina Mary, who later married Cholmeley Austen-Leigh and was the mother of the printer Richard Austen-Leigh) spent much of 1834&#150;5 in Italy. His health restored, he returned to England and was ordained priest on 5 July 1835 and in September was made perpetual curate of the newly instituted parish of Curbridge (Winchester).<br>
<br>Trench's six years at Curbridge (his house had once been William Cobbett's) saw the growth of his reputation as a scholar and, equally significant, the development of his friendship with Samuel Wilberforce. His first theological work, <span class="italic">Notes on the Parables of Our Lord</span> (1841) was a substantial work of exegesis, 467 pages in all. It was well received and, running to fourteen revised editions, his most popular work. It was claimed by his biographer to mark the beginning of &#145;that other &#147;Cambridge Movement&#148; which reached its zenith and glory in the work of the great <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scholars Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort&#146;  (Bromley, 70). These years also saw the publication of volumes of poetry that included <span class="italic">Sabbation; Honor Neale; and other Poems</span> (1838). <span class="italic">Elegiac Poems</span> (1843) was much influenced by the death of his eight-year-old son, Francis William, in 1841:<blockquote>
<div>in my hand I feel the grasp<br>
</div>
<div>of that small hand, whose tender clasp<br>
</div>
<div>I shall not feel, oh! any more.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In 1841 Trench was appointed curate to Wilberforce at Alverstoke and although three years later he moved to be rector of Itchen Stoke (1844), Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford from 1845, made him his examining chaplain. He continued to publish theology and poetry and was special preacher at Cambridge (1843) and Hulsean lecturer (1845 and 1846). Evincing a considerable interest in philology, he delivered a series of lectures which he published (1851) as <span class="italic">Study of Words</span>, which ran into many editions. He followed this with <span class="italic">English Past and Present</span> (1855) and <span class="italic">A Select Glossary</span> (1859). These works constituted an important impetus toward the study of the English language. In 1857 he joined the Philological Society, energetically championing the cause of producing a new English dictionary. He read papers on the subject to the society, published as <span class="italic">On some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries</span> (1857, 2nd edn 1860) and a resolution of his, put to the society on 7 January 1858, is commonly regarded as having provided the impetus that, the Clarendon Press having been interested in the enterprise, led to the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>. His seminal role is recorded in the &#145;Historical introduction&#146; to the work. His reputation was further enhanced by the publication of his second major book, <span class="italic">Notes on the Miracles of Our Lord</span>, in 1846. In the following year he was appointed professor of divinity at King's College, London, a chair that he held until 1856, when he became dean of Westminster.<br>
<br>Trench was responsible for some innovations, including a Sunday evening service, of which the sermon was a popular component. In 1860 he published his <span class="italic">Sermons Preached in Westminster Abbey</span> (as in 1873 he would publish <span class="italic">Sermons Preached for the most Part in Ireland</span>), but he was not regarded as an especially accomplished preacher. It was during his time at Westminster that two of his sons died abroad, Arthur in 1860 and Richard in 1861.<br>
<br>Trench was appointed, not without opposition, in 1863 to succeed Richard Whately as archbishop of Dublin, his consecration taking place on 1 January 1864. His friend F. D. Maurice described the move as &#145;an awful thing&#146;, and indeed the new archbishop came to a church that was entering a particularly turbulent period in its history, in which he was to play a vital, and frequently uncongenial, part. The Established Church of Ireland had already, in the early decades of the century, experienced considerable administrative reform, and continued to be the object of public scrutiny, partly because of its relative wealth, partly because of its minority position. The census of 1861 revealed that of an Irish population of some four and a quarter million, less than three-quarters of a million belonged to the established church. Gladstone identified the Irish church establishment as a major Irish grievance and, in the face of fierce resistance and non-co-operation from its leadership, effected disendowment and disestablishment by the <span class="roman">Irish Church Act</span> (1869). None had been more intransigent opponents than Trench, described by the prime minister as &#145;a dreamer of dreams&#146;  (Gladstone, 7.14&#150;15), who &#145;talks of negotiating at a time when all negotiation will have gone by&#146;, though some years later Gladstone's sense of justice caused him to dub Trench &#145;this excellent man&#146;  (Gladstone, 9.264).<br>
<br>It was in the immediate aftermath of disestablishment, when controversy raged about the formulation of a constitution for the Church of Ireland and prayer book revision, that Trench proved to be a highly significant figure. He feared for the catholicity of the newly disestablished church, and that either by its form of government or by liturgical change (the motivation for which had a strongly protestant and anti-ritualist strand) it might cut itself off from the wider Anglican world, or be torn by schism.<br>
<br>In the general convention that met in 1870 to draw up a constitution, Trench argued (successfully) for the bishops to have what amounted to a veto in the general synod. In matters doctrinal and liturgical he had already given opponents in his diocese occasion to attack &#145;Puseyite Trench&#146;, and he fought tenaciously, if not always tactfully&#151;he has been described by a modern though sympathetic commentator as &#145;the figure who most exacerbated the situation&#146;  (Clarke, 284)&#151;in the face of bitter and sometimes ill-informed criticism, for what he believed vital to the survival of the Church of Ireland as part of catholic Christendom. Though an awkward ally at times, he was a key figure among those who ensured that the Irish <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> of 1878 to all intents and purposes retained the integrity of its predecessors.<br>
<br>It can be said with some conviction that Trench's work in Dublin has been more enduring than his theological writing and his poetry, neither of which, however highly rated in their day, can be said to have stood the test of time (though several lines of his kept their place in the second edition of <span class="italic">The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</span>, and one survived to the third). But his <span class="italic">On the Study of Words</span> came out in the <span class="roman">Everyman Library</span> in 1927, and in 1994 was included in the series <span class="roman">History of Linguistics: British Linguistics in the Nineteenth Century</span>, Trench being described in the introduction to this edition as &#145;father of the world's best dictionary&#146; and &#145;one of the foremost advocates of &#147;scientific&#148; [historical] lexicography in Victorian England&#146;  (p. ix).<br>
<br>Also of lasting importance was the archbishop's active support for the founding of Alexandra College, Dublin (1866), which pioneered in Ireland the education of women, not only for university courses, but also, from 1880 to 1904, for the degrees of the Royal University of Ireland.<br>
<br>The years of disestablishment and liturgical revision were, for Trench, a time of spiritual and intellectual anguish. To this was added physical suffering when he broke both his legs in a fall on board ship in 1875 when returning from one of his many visits to England. He felt compelled by failing health to resign in November 1884 (waiving his pension rights), and died on 28 March 1886 at 23 Eaton Square, London, where he had spent the winter. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 2 April, his epitaph composed by Dean Church.<br>
<br>Trench's eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_27698"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Chenevix Trench</span>  (1837&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 10 October 1837, was commissioned in the 20th hussars on 20 January 1857 and was made a lieutenant on 30 April 1858. He had a distinguished military career, being decorated for his service in India (he was present at the capture of Lucknow in 1858) and was made captain in 1867, lieutenant-colonel in 1880, and colonel in 1884. On 17 July 1873 he married Mary Frederica Blanche, the only daughter of Charles Mulville, captain in the 3rd dragoon guards. They had two sons and three daughters. Military attach&eacute; at St Petersburg from 1881 to 1886, he retired in the following year with the honorary rank of major-general and died at Braemar on 8 August 1894. He was author of several military works.<br>
