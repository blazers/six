<span class="headword">Fox <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Henderson]</span>,  Aileen Mary</span>, Lady Fox  (1907&#150;2005), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 29 July 1907 at 12 Kensington Square, London, the eldest of three daughters of Walter Scott Henderson (1871&#150;1945), a solicitor, and his wife, Alice Livingstone, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McClean (<i>d</i>. 1966). She was educated at Downe House School, Berkshire (1921&#150;5), and, after a court presentation, read English at Newnham College, Cambridge (1926&#150;9). Early continental travels with her father had sparked her interest in archaeology. After graduation she obtained an introduction to the inspector of ancient monuments, J. P. Bushe-Fox, and started unpaid work at the Roman site at Richborough: in the 1930s there was no formal archaeological training in Britain. She gradually became well known among the rising generation of archaeologists and on 6 July 1933 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33230/', "Cyril Fred Fox (1882&#150;1967)")</script>, director of the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff, who was knighted in 1935. They had three sons. She collaborated in her husband's fieldwork in south Wales and initiated her own projects, notably excavations at Caerleon Roman fortress, published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> (1940). These experiences established her interest and expertise in later British prehistory and the Roman occupation of Britain. During the Second World War she lectured in archaeology at University College, Cardiff.<br>
<br>In 1945 Aileen Fox was invited to undertake rescue excavation on bombed sites in the Roman city of Exeter, in which she used a range of pioneering open area methods. This led to <span class="italic">Roman Exeter: Excavations in War-Damaged Areas, 1945&#150;7</span> (1952). She became lecturer in archaeology at the University College of the South West at Exeter in 1947. On her husband's retirement in 1948 the family moved to Exeter, where she remained as senior lecturer until her retirement in 1972, five years after her husband's death. Throughout her time at Exeter (which obtained university status in 1955) she promoted the teaching of archaeology with a strong practical bias.<br>
<br>South-west England in the late 1940s was an open research field to a dynamic archaeologist, and Aileen Fox was known for her energy. On Dartmoor there had been no systematic research for decades and her excavations of settlements at Kestor and Dean Moor, published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Devonshire Association</span>, remain classics. A series of papers established significant regional variations among Iron Age hillforts. With William Ravenhill, she investigated a range of Roman military sites, and produced the first evidence of the Roman army's presence in Cornwall, at the fort of Nanstallon near Bodmin. She drew all this research together in her significant synthesis <span class="italic">South West England</span> (1964), written in her distinctive, clear and definite style. She continued rescue work in Exeter but by the late 1960s the scale of archaeological work was changing. She was instrumental in setting up the Exeter Archaeological Field Unit, later Exeter Archaeology, which in 1971 produced dramatic proof of the presence of Legio II Augusta in the cathedral close. The publication <span class="italic">The Legionary Bath-House and Basilica and Forum</span> was both dedicated to, and prefaced by, her. Successive directors of the unit owed much to her practical help and encouragement. She helped revitalize the Devon Archaeological Society and was elected its president for 1963&#150;4. She also served as a vice-president of the Council for British Archaeology.<br>
<br>By Fox's retirement in 1972 local archaeological provision was much expanded, largely due to her efforts. She felt the need for a new arena for research and moved to Auckland, New Zealand, and left her local successors, mainly in positions she had helped establish, to &#145;get on with things&#146; (in her own words). In New Zealand she found a small but thriving archaeological community to which she could make a major contribution. She remained for ten years, first as visiting lecturer at the university, then as acting archaeologist at Auckland Museum, and finally in a voluntary capacity. Her research in New Zealand ranged from excavations on Maori pas&#151;in some ways similar to British hillforts&#151;to studies of artefacts. Significant publications were <span class="italic">Prehistoric Maori Fortifications</span> (1976) and <span class="italic">Carved Maori Burial Chests</span> (1983). Her colleagues contributed to an affectionate Festschrift, <span class="italic">A Lot of Spadework to be Done</span>, on her return to England in 1983.<br>
<br>Aileen Fox was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1944. A highlight of her later years in England was the award by Exeter University of an honorary doctorate of letters in 1985. Another valued award was honorary membership of the Prehistoric Society in 1998. She remained active in archaeological life in Devon, publishing papers well into her late eighties. She suffered from ill health in her last years and died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter on 21 November 2005, following a stroke. Her body was cremated on 29 November at the Devon and Exeter crematorium, Topsham, Exeter. Her final work was her delightfully readable autobiography, <span class="italic">Aileen: a Pioneering Archaeologist</span> (2000). This is a graphic inside portrait of a career that brought about major developments in the understanding and organization of archaeology in two very different areas, south-west England and New Zealand, and made her a valued influence on scholars and amateurs in both areas. She was survived by her three sons.<br>
