<span class="headword">Golding,  Louis</span>  (1895&#150;1958), <span class="occ">writer</span>, the second son of the four children of Philip Golding (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1916), religious orator and teacher, and his wife, Yetta (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1913), was born at Red Bank, Manchester, on 19 November 1895. His parents were Orthodox Jews who had immigrated to Manchester from Cherkassy on the Dnieper River a year or two prior to Golding's birth. Educated at the Waterloo Road elementary school, he won a scholarship to Manchester grammar school, wrote for the school magazine, and gained awards for his poetry. In November 1913 Golding won a scholarship to read history at Queen's College, Oxford, matriculating in October 1914. When the First World War broke out, rather than studying he attempted to enlist in the Officers' Training Corps. Rejected because, as he wrote in his autobiographical <span class="italic">The World I Knew</span> (1940), &#145;The authorities disliked my eyes, my tonsils, and my lungs&#146;  (Golding, 22), he became a hospital orderly and then a YMCA worker engaged in hospital duties serving in the Fifth Canadian Hospital in Salonika, Greece. After returning to Oxford in the autumn of 1919, he changed to English literature but illness prevented him taking his final examinations in 1921.<br>
<br>In 1919 a book of poems, <span class="italic">Sorrows of War</span>, based on the war and Golding's war experiences was published. <span class="italic">Forward from Babylon</span>, an autobiographical novel set in the north of England and at Manchester grammar school, appeared in 1921. From 1919 to 1921 Golding contributed upwards of sixty pieces including poems, short stories, and review essays to <span class="italic">Voices</span>, a Manchester-based literary magazine. Subsequently he received a grant from the Royal Literary Fund. Advised by doctors to seek warmer climates rather than to risk a somewhat delicate constitution, he began his travels abroad and the life of a professional writer. He also sold books. <span class="italic">Seacoast of Bohemia</span> (1923) was a satirical novel based upon his early travels. For the travel narratives <span class="italic">Sunward</span> (1924), and <span class="italic">Sicilian Noon</span> (1925), Golding drew upon his travels in Italy; Capri and Sicily, with its Homeric landscape, especially appealed to him. <span class="italic">Sunward</span> in particular received high critical praise, A. E. Coppard writing in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (11 October 1924), &#145;there is wit, whimsical fancy, a deal of impertinence, and some beautiful writing&#146;  (p. 514).<br>
<br>Golding used his Jewish inheritance for his <span class="italic">Three Ancient Lands: being a Journey to Palestine</span> (1928), an account of his journey from Port Said to Palestine. The book is noteworthy for its powerful descriptive travel narrative and photographs of early Jewish settlements including the early kibbutzim (collective farms). Golding's semi-autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Day of Atonement</span> (1925), set in Russia, the north of England, and Sicily, drew upon his family experiences. In the summer of 1928 Golding was in Morocco. In 1929 and 1930 he visited Spain and Paris where he wrote <span class="italic">The Prince or Somebody</span> (1929) and <span class="italic">Give up your Lovers</span> (1930), which uses the theme of his earlier works&#151;the love between Jew and gentile.<br>
<br>Golding's fame rests upon his best-selling novel <span class="italic">Magnolia Street</span>, published early in 1932. The novel concentrated on the relationships between Jews and non-Jews in a district of Manchester during the 1910&#150;30 period. Translated into twenty-seven languages, and selling more than a million copies, banned by Hitler and Mussolini, serialized in the London <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, a new edition appeared as late as 1958&#151;the year of Golding's death. Golding dramatized the novel and C. B. Cochran produced it at the Adelphi Theatre, London, in 1934. Writing in the <span class="italic">New Statesman and Nation</span>, Gerald Bullett described the novel as &#145;a magnificent achievement: copious, humorous, romantic, tragic, genial, ironical, angry, wise; alive with action in every part, and crammed with the rich stuff of humanity&#146;  (23 Jan 1932, 96).<br>
<br>During the writing of <span class="italic">Magnolia Street</span> Golding spent time in 1931 in Berlin. In the summer of 1932 he went to Russia. In 1935 he accepted the suggestion of the London publishers Rich and Cowan that he follow Moses's ancient journey from the Nile bullrushes to Mount Pisgah. This trip formed the foundation for <span class="italic">In the Steps of Moses the Conqueror</span> (1943). During the 1930s Golding also travelled widely in the United States. Golding wrote short stories, anti-fascist propaganda, Jewish history, radio drama, and literary criticism. Film scripts included <span class="italic">Theirs is the Glory</span> about the Arnhem operation during the Second World War. He wrote three books on boxing: <span class="italic">Boxing Tales: a Collection of Thrilling Stories</span> (1948), and in the same year <span class="italic">My Sporting Days and Nights</span>. This was followed in 1952 by <span class="italic">The Bare-Knuckle Breed</span>. His monograph <span class="italic">James Joyce</span> (1933) was one of the first books to be devoted to the great writer. His versatility is further demonstrated by <span class="italic">We Shall Eat and Drink Again: a Wine and Food Anthology</span>, which he edited with Andr&eacute; L. Simon (1944).<br>
<br>Golding was included on George Orwell's 1948&#150;9 listing of &#145;Crypto-communists and fellow travellers&#146;. Orwell describes Golding as &#145;only a vague sympathizer&#146;  (Orwell, 247). Golding's work by no means focused on Jewish themes. Black magic and the Sicilian Mafia provide the background for the ironically titled <span class="italic">The Camberwell Beauty</span> (1935). <span class="italic">The Loving Brothers</span> (1952) focuses upon two very contrasting brothers. <span class="italic">Good-bye to Ithaca</span> (1955), his final travel narrative, &#145;details the differences between a modern traveller going on an odyssey and the hardships that the ancients must have encountered&#146;  (Reed, 130).<br>
<br>Sequels to <span class="italic">Magnolia Street</span> include <span class="italic">Five Silver Daughters</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Mr. Emmanuel</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Glory of Elsie Silver</span> (1946). <span class="italic">Five Silver Daughters</span> goes beyond Manchester to encompass a European canvas. The Nazi persecutions become the theme of <span class="italic">Mr. Emmanuel</span>. The heroic but tragic Warsaw ghetto uprising preoccupies <span class="italic">The Glory of Elsie Silver</span>. This was the first western European novel to focus on this important resistance to oppression. <span class="italic">Mr. Emmanuel</span>, according to Kushner, &#145;was the only one of 20 Golding novels converted into film&#146; and &#145;was the only major British anti-Nazi film produced&#146; during the Second World War  (Kushner, 219).<br>
<br>Critics spoke of Golding's over-production. Rumours circulated in literary circles that his later works were ghosted by writers such as Emanuel Litvinoff, and this may possibly have been the case with the posthumously published <span class="italic">The Frightening Tale</span> (1973). Known to be homosexual  (private information), Golding lived in the last years of his life in a &#145;large, tall house in St. John's Wood&#146; (16 Hamilton Terrace) with a &#145;large, book-lined study&#146;  (Simons, 112). He married on 12 March 1956 a childhood friend, Mrs Annie Carrie Weintrobe, daughter of Abraham Sugarman, a commercial traveller; her previous marriage had been dissolved. She had been the inspiration in 1932 for the character of Bella in <span class="italic">Magnolia Street</span>.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1958 Golding died of carcinoma of the pancreas in St George's Hospital, London, three weeks after an operation. He was cremated at the Golders Green crematorium in Middlesex on 13 August. For the Anglo-Jewish novelist Alexander Baron, Golding was the last &#145;link with the past &hellip; he was still at home in that old world of <i>Yiddishkeit</i> that such writers as Sholem Asch and Zangwill represented in their different ways&#146;. Although as a man emotionally reticent, his writings &#145;achieved moments of real power and &hellip; represent their only consistent treatment of their subject in modern British literature &hellip; the larger drama of the Jewish people&#146;  (Baron). Jacob Sonntag, the editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly</span>, observed that &#145;he accepted his own Jewishness without any doubt or reservation, considering it real enough in a historical and personal (though not in a religious) sense&#146;  (Sonntag).<br>
