</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Still, Dame  Alicia Frances Jane  Lloyd-</span>  (1869&#150;1944), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 4 November 1869 in Colombo, Ceylon, the eldest child of Henry Lloyd Still (<i>fl</i>. 1869&#150;1893) of the Ceylon civil service and his wife, Isabel Clements (<i>fl</i>. 1869&#150;1893); two sons and another daughter were born after their return to England. Alicia grew up in Walton, near Clevedon in Somerset, and was educated at home, mainly by her father. Later in life she regretted her want of formal education, complaining that she was &#145;never really educated&#146;, but though she lacked literary and linguistic skills she had read widely.<br>
<br>In 1893 Lloyd-Still persuaded her parents to let her go to the Warminster Cottage Hospital in Wiltshire for a year's nursing experience; she was then eligible to apply for training in a London teaching hospital at the age of twenty-five. At Warminster she showed considerable aptitude, and the matron thought highly of her potential capabilities. In 1894 she was accepted as a paying probationer at St Thomas's Hospital under the matronship of Louise Gordon, who had been appointed in 1889. After she completed her training and received her certificate, Lloyd-Still was appointed sister of Charity ward; she was the last Nightingale nurse to be sent to South Street to receive her commission &#145;from the hands of the Foundress herself&#146;, as she described it. In later years she made much of this encounter, seeing herself in the direct line of succession, which impressed would-be candidates and their parents.<br>
<br>Although weak on theory and written work, Lloyd-Still showed considerable aptitude for administration and teaching, and she was remembered by her nurses for her attention to detail and for her &#145;single-minded purpose of benefiting her patients&#146;. Some twenty years earlier St Thomas's had opened St Thomas's Home for paying patients, and in 1903 Lloyd-Still was made sister-in-charge of the home. This brought her into contact with a wide range of physicians and surgeons who were impressed by her organizing ability and championed her promotion. In 1904 Lloyd-Still became the matron of the Brompton Hospital, which was employing a new regime for the treatment of tuberculosis. This involved fresh air, rest, and special diets, which required of the nurses different training, which Lloyd-Still organized, giving the lectures herself and helping to establish a sanatorium at Frimley.<br>
<br>After five happy years at Brompton, Lloyd-Still left for the greater prize of lady superintendent of the Middlesex Hospital, which already had a well-established system for training nurses, with particular emphasis on the ward sisters as instructors of the probationers. With her conviction that nurses needed a better foundation in theory Lloyd-Still persuaded the governors to appoint a specially designated sister tutor, who would have no ward duties but devote herself entirely to the teaching of nurses, and it was agreed to appoint Marion Gullan from University College Hospital, with which the Middlesex had close ties.<br>
<br>Lucy Seymer, in her memoir of Dame Alicia, which was virtually a eulogy published privately a few years after Lloyd-Still's death, states that she &#145;made remarkable improvements in the nursing at the Middlesex&#146;. However, researching the nursing records for the first years of the century one cannot but be struck by the clarity and apparent perspicacity of the comments on probationers made by her predecessor, and the rather perfunctory and almost indecipherable notes left by Lloyd-Still; she may have had a &#145;forceful personality&#146; but it does not come over on paper. She was 5 feet 10 inches tall, slender, and always erect, even in old age; nurses described her as &#145;gliding down the ward&#146;. Her most conspicuous feature, one often remarked upon, was her mass of unruly red-gold hair turning to grey as she grew older, which she confessed she never mastered&#151;it mastered her. Since she placed much emphasis on the importance of neatness in the Nightingale young ladies and particularly in a demure coiffure, her own unmanageable hair was the subject of ironic comment. Later probationers likened her to Queen Mary, with whom she was on friendly terms and who was an occasional visitor, with Lambeth Palace and the archbishop conveniently next door.<h2>
<a name="MatronofStThomassHospital"></a>Matron of St Thomas's Hospital</h2>In 1913, after an absence of nine years, Lloyd-Still returned to St Thomas's as its matron. By now the Nightingale School was no longer unique: almost all teaching hospitals had a school of nursing and in some ways the Nightingale School was behind the times. The so-called Nightingale tradition was a two-edged sword. Florence Nightingale herself had been ambivalent about the amount of medical and theoretical knowledge nurses needed, not because she thought them incapable of acquiring such knowledge, but because she did not see nurses as doctors' assistants, but rather as promoters of &#145;Sanitary Science&#146; and preventive medicine&#151;a skill in which she thought, with some justification, that doctors were deficient. With missionary zeal she saw sanitary science as the key to the abolition of ill health, with hospitals as an intermediary stage of civilization. As far as the &#145;handicraft of Nursing&#146; was concerned, this, she maintained, could only be taught on the wards. For this reason she had opposed the idea of a preliminary training school where probationers were given a course of theoretical lectures before going on the wards, saying that it was like trying to teach Greek before English. However, in the intervening years the new-style nurses, for better or for worse, were indeed becoming doctors' assistants, and nursing schools were adopting the system of giving preliminary instruction to nurses before they set foot in the wards. This arrangement had an attraction for administrators: it weeded out the unsuitable and reduced the high drop-out rate and it was a privilege for which the candidate herself paid. St Thomas's had to wait until after Nightingale's death in 1910 before such a system was introduced. At the same time, in the competition for candidates, other teaching hospitals were offering better living conditions and amenities, while the Nightingale School rested on its laurels.<br>
<br>In spite of her veneration of the Nightingale tradition Lloyd-Still set in train a number of changes that would have been anathema to &#145;the foundress&#146;. First, she appointed a sister to be in charge of the preliminary school and extended the course, then she brought Gullan from the Middlesex to be a sister tutor with no ward responsibilities. Given the problems involved in teaching in the apprenticeship system, this was probably Lloyd-Still's most important contribution. In 1916 she inaugurated the award of medals to the most successful candidates, and in 1925 she introduced the Nightingale badge, to be worn by nurses who had received their certificate. The Nightingale School was becoming like a public school in more ways than one. Florence Nightingale had been against medals and badges; apart from the fact that they were pretentious, when worn on uniform she considered them unhygienic.<br>
<br>On the other hand, Lloyd-Still did little to mitigate Florence Nightingale's main complaint that probationers were doing half the hospital's work. Comparing the tasks performed by the probationers in the 1880s and in the 1920s, they were latterly spending more time on what Nightingale described as menial tasks. In the fifty or so years since the founding of the school nursing had been caught in the web of its own success. In the absence of many opportunities for women elsewhere, nursing had become fashionable. To debt-ridden hospitals there was an unending stream of suitable candidates who were biddable and cheap, and if young and attractive they added prestige; hospitals now had a vested interest in large numbers of probationers doing the longest possible course. At the same time nurse leaders saw a long and arduous training as a way of raising the status of the profession.<br>
<br>Lloyd-Still's plans were soon interrupted by the outbreak of war, when St Thomas's Hospital became the 5th London General, with huts erected between the blocks to accommodate 400 officers and men; she herself became a territorial matron. Finding nursing staff was a formidable administrative task, former nurses were recalled and volunteers recruited, and there was an influx of young women of whom many would not have thought of nursing as a career before the war. However, the new candidates in the post-war world of women's emancipation had a different attitude to the strict discipline and rules. Addressing a conference in Manchester in 1919, reported in the <span class="italic">Nursing Times</span>, Lloyd-Still noted regretfully &#145;The sense of service is already weakened. It goes hand in hand with personal responsibility and that, alas! is seldom brought home to the modern girl. She is naturally pleasure-loving and heedless and therefore difficult material to train.&#146;<br>
<br>The withdrawal of government subsidy after the war, and rising costs and demands put the survival of the voluntary hospitals in doubt. The prospect of state control hung like the sword of Damocles throughout the inter-war years and encouraged the rationalization of low pay and long hours of work. Lloyd-Still declared that the matrons had striven for better pay for trained staff, but hospital funds had other claims: as for the probationers, they should be grateful for the valuable training they received, which formed good habits of mind and body. Apparently untroubled by the high sickness and wastage rate in the mid-1930s, Dame Alicia&#151;the title of DBE was conferred on her in 1934&#151;continued to impress on probationers that the &#145;discipline of St Thomas's was the discipline of the Guards&#146;, and that Nightingale gentlewomen were known throughout the British empire. When off duty their dress must be subdued and they must never be without hat and gloves; only shop girls wore coloured jackets. When Dame Alicia retired in 1937 at the age of sixty-eight she appeared to probationers, who were still exhorted to &#145;polish their brasses to the glory of God&#146;, as one for whom time had stood still. A probationer who trained in the 1920s wrote: &#145;She was a good matron, she inspired awe. She had no sense of humour but she was just, she looked the part&#151;large and imperial. No one who worked under her would ever forget her.&#146;<h2>
<a name="Workforthenursingprofession"></a>Work for the nursing profession</h2>By virtue of her position as head of the Nightingale School, Lloyd-Still was consulted on the wider issues concerning nursing. In spite of her lack of oratorial skill her contribution was considerable, though sometimes at odds with her policy for her own hospital. During the war she had come into contact with Arthur Stanley and Dame Sarah Swift, who had the task of sorting out the disputes between the various nursing factions arguing about state registration for nurses. Stanley conceived the idea of a college of nursing analogous with the medical royal colleges, which would act as a forum and whose members would be elected by nurses themselves. The College of Nursing was founded in 1916 and the first meeting was held at St Thomas's by invitation of Lloyd-Still, who became a founder member and then a member of council (1920&#150;38); she was a vice-president from 1938 until her death.<br>
<br>The acrimonious dispute about state registration was resolved by the new minister of health in 1919, when a separate statutory body&#151;the General Nursing Council&#151;was set up. Lloyd-Still was elected to the first council and became chairman of the education and examination committee. She was a prime mover in negotiations for diploma courses for nurses under the aegis of the University of London. Always interested in military nursing, Lloyd-Still was invited to serve on the board of Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, which she did until 1935; she was retained in an advisory capacity after her retirement.<h2>
<a name="Workintheinternationalarena"></a>Work in the international arena</h2>In 1919 Lloyd-Still went to Cannes as the nursing delegate at a medical conference, the purpose of which was to help countries devastated by war to solve their health-care problems. The outcome was the foundation of the League of Red Cross Societies, which led to the establishment of post-registration courses for nurses. Some of these were held at London University, and Lloyd-Still gave practical assistance to the project. In 1925 she spent some time in America and attended the International Council of Nurses Congress in Montreal, which discussed the foundation of a Florence Nightingale memorial. A committee was set up with Lloyd-Still as one of its guiding spirits. In 1933 delegates from twelve countries met in London to inaugurate the Florence Nightingale Memorial Foundation, with Lloyd-Still as president. For the rest of her life she took an interest in the international students and watched the growth of the Old Internationals Association. The same year, in Paris, she was elected president of the International Council of Nurses Congress, an honour that she held for the next quadrennial period, which ended as she retired.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandlateryears"></a>Reputation and later years</h2>The abiding impression of Lloyd-Still is of a woman of striking appearance and strong personality imbued with a firm religious conviction, to whom the care of the sick was &#145;a sacred trust&#146;. A child of the late Victorian era, she grew up inculcated with its social values and mores, which served her well when nursing was still striving to be a profession and a worthy occupation for respectable women. After the First World War, as women became more emancipated and society more egalitarian, those values began to look anachronistic, and by the 1930s the emphasis on the right background and breeding, rather than competence, began to look like social snobbery. In <span class="italic">A Bride for St Thomas</span>, Christine Nolan, describing her years as a lady probationer immediately prior to the Second World War, recalled how, at her interview, Dame Alicia swept into a convenient waste-paper basket the documents she had brought testifying to her nursing experience in America, saying &#145;Well child, you don't of course expect me to take this American nonsense seriously do you?&#146; Dame Alicia then gave Nolan her advice to candidates without the right background: &#145;run along dear, and join one of the County Council Hospitals, they will be pleased to have you&#146;.<br>
<br>Dame Alicia was a woman of paradoxes. A non-intellectual, she became an international campaigner for better education and university courses for nurses. At the same time she was telling applicants that she had no time for certificates of matriculation; she was looking for gentlewomen who were known throughout the British empire for what they were. However, while she was apparently unmoved by the miseries of probationers in tears because of their inability to achieve perfection in the alignment of bed castors, she could be unexpectedly kind to nurses in trouble. She was a council member of the College of Nursing in the late 1930s when it was campaigning for better salaries and a shorter working week for nurses, but when the Nightingale nurses were found to be involved in an association with similar modest aims they were told that such organizations &#145;were financed by Moscow gold to destroy the British voluntary system&#146;. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross in 1917 and made a commander of the British empire the same year. Her other honours included being made lady of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem (1922), the Florence Nightingale medal (1933), and the medaille d'honneur de assistance publique (1933).<br>
<br>Dame Alicia's final years were clouded by the war. She retired to property in Curry Rivel at Sedgemoor in Somerset, and was cut off from friends because of the difficulties in travelling. Then terminal illness forced her to seek refuge with her younger sister in Buckfast, Devon, where she was nursed by two Nightingale nurses. She died at Buckfast on 23 July 1944, and after a funeral service in the chapel at St Thomas's Hospital, she was buried on 26 July in Brookwood cemetery, Woking, Surrey, in ground that she had acquired for Nightingale nurses. A memorial service was held at St Margaret's, Westminster, London, on 28 July.<br>
