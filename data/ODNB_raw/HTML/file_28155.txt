<span class="headword">Vaughan,  William</span>  (1752&#150;1850), <span class="occ">promoter of the London docks</span>, was born in London on 22 September 1752, the second son of Samuel Vaughan (1720&#150;1802), a London merchant, and his wife, Sarah (1727&#150;1809), daughter of Benjamin Hallowell of Boston, Massachusetts. He received a good education, first at Newcome's school at Hackney, Middlesex, then at the academy at Warrington in Lancashire, where he and his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28123/', "Benjamin Vaughan")</script> resided with the eminent Dr Joseph Priestley. His studies were much directed to geography, history, travels, and voyages of discovery. After leaving school he entered his father's business, and soon became prominent in mercantile and commercial affairs. In 1783 he was elected a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation, and continued in it, as director, sub-governor, and governor, until 1829.<br>
<br>In 1791 Vaughan endeavoured to form a society for the promotion of English canals, and, with this end in view, made a collection, in three folio volumes, of plans and descriptions relating to the subject. Failing in his objective, he turned his attention to docks, on which he became one of the first authorities. From 1793 to 1797 he published a series of pamphlets and tracts advocating the construction of docks for the port of London, and on 22 April 1796 he gave evidence before a parliamentary committee in favour of the bill for establishing wet docks. In 1839 he published many of these papers, prefaced by a memoir of his own life. The great development of London as a port must be regarded as partly due to his unceasing exertions.<br>
<br>During the naval mutiny at the Nore in 1797 Vaughan formed one of the committee of London merchants convened to meet at the Royal Exchange to take prompt measures to restore tranquillity. He proved extremely active, and independently drew up a short address to the seamen which was put in circulation by the naval authorities.<br>
<br>Vaughan was for many years a fellow of the Royal Society, the Linnean Society, and the Royal Astronomical Society, and a member of numerous societies dedicated to the physical and moral welfare of various groups in England and North America. He was a member of the New England corporation, and filled the office of governor until 1829. As a member of the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, he was involved in 1815 in establishing the first savings bank in London, at Leicester Place, Westminster. He was a governor of Christ's Hospital and an honorary member of the Society of Civil Engineers. Beset by failing sight in old age, and apparently unmarried, Vaughan died in London on 5 May 1850, at his residence, 70 Fenchurch Street.<br>
