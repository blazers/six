<span class="headword">Knott,  Cargill Gilston</span>  (1856&#150;1922), <span class="occ">physicist and seismologist</span>, was born on 30 June 1856 in Valleyfield, Midlothian, the sixth son in the family of seven sons and one daughter of Pelham Knott (1818&#150;1864), clerk in a paper mill and later paper (commission) agent of Penicuik, and his wife, Helen Macintyre (1817&#150;1894), daughter of Patrick McOmish, writer of Edinburgh, and his wife, Elizabeth Arrott. The family, though originally English, had been settled in Scotland for several generations. Maternally, Knott was descended from the brother of Donald Cargill the Martyr. Following the death of his father Knott was brought up by an aunt and uncle in Edinburgh and he attended Arbroath high school (1864&#150;72). He went on to Edinburgh University in October 1872. After gaining his BSc in 1876 he became a research assistant to P. G. Tait, professor of natural philosophy. Knott worked in his laboratory&#151;an ill-equipped attic&#151;until 1883, after obtaining his DSc with a thesis on researches in contact electricity in 1879.<br>
<br>In 1883 Knott travelled to Japan to succeed J. A. Ewing as professor of physics in the Imperial College of Engineering (later the Imperial University of Japan). In June 1885 at the British legation in Tokyo he married Mary (formerly Jane) Gray Dixon (1860&#150;1934), eldest daughter of the Revd James Main Dixon, minister of Free Martyrs Church, Paisley, and his wife, Jane Gray; they had one son and three daughters. In Tokyo Knott worked closely with J. Milne, T. Gray, and F. Omori to develop the new science of seismology. He applied Fourier analysis to investigate annual periodicity of earthquake shocks (1886) and developed a theory to explain the reflection and refraction of earthquake waves at the boundary between rock and water (1888). In 1887 he and A. Tanakadate conducted the first magnetic survey of Japan, for which Knott had the unusual distinction of being decorated by the emperor in 1891 with the order of the Rising Sun (class 4). On his return to Scotland that same year Knott was appointed lecturer in mathematics and in 1892 reader in applied mathematics at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>In 1899 Knott extended his earlier theory to wave behaviour at the interface between two different types of rock. This work laid the foundation for the later unravelling of the interior structure of the earth through observation of the behaviour of seismic waves as they are transmitted through it from distant earthquakes.<br>
<br>Knott became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880 and its general secretary in 1912, and was a principal founder of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society. He was Thompson lecturer, United Free Church college, Aberdeen, in 1905&#150;6 and 1913&#150;14. His 113 publications include the books: <span class="italic">Electricity and Magnetism</span> (1893), <span class="italic">The Physics of Earthquake Phenomena</span> (1908), and the <span class="italic">Life and Scientific Work of Peter Guthrie Tait</span> (1911). He received the Keith prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for work on the magnetic properties of iron and nickel in 1897. He held an honorary LLD of the University of St Andrews (1916) and was elected FRS in 1920.<br>
<br>His contemporaries remembered Knott as kindly, painstaking, cheerful, and imperturbably good-natured. He enjoyed golf and chess and held office in the United Free Church of Scotland. Knott died of aortic heart disease on 26 October 1922 at 42 Upper Gray Street, Edinburgh, where he had lived since 1891. He was buried on 28 October at Newington cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
