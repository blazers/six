<span class="headword">Braddock <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bamber]</span>,  Elizabeth Margaret <span class="st"> [Bessie]</span></span>  (1899&#150;1970), <span class="occ">trade union activist and politician</span>, was born at Zante Street, Liverpool, on 24 September 1899, the elder daughter of Hugh Bamber, bookbinder, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Andrew Little, an Edinburgh lawyer. Mary Bamber became national organizer of the Union of Distributive and Allied Workers and was a passionate socialist, once described by E. Sylvia Pankhurst as the finest fighting platform speaker in the country.<br>
<br>Bessie Bamber left elementary school at fourteen to take a job filling seed packets for 5<i>s</i>. a week; later she worked for a draper and subsequently for the Co-op, where she joined the union movement of which she was to be a lifelong member. Her main interest, however, was in politics. From socialist Sunday school she moved to the Independent Labour Party, leaving this in 1920 because she found it insufficiently radical, and going on to join the recently formed Communist Party of Great Britain instead. In 1924 she repudiated communism and returned to the labour movement.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1922 Bessie married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65629/', "John Braddock")</script> (known as Jack; 1892&#150;1963) who shared her political and social interests. They had no children. Their marriage, which was very close, lasted until Jack's death in 1963: by then the Braddocks had become legendary in the politics of Merseyside. He became leader of the Liverpool city council; she was a member of the city council from 1930 to 1961, for the last six years as an alderman.<br>
<br>In 1936 Bessie Braddock was adopted as the prospective parliamentary candidate for the Exchange division of Liverpool. Because of the extension of the life of the 1935 parliament as a consequence of the war, she had to wait until 1945 to fight an election, which she won with a majority of 665. She was the first Labour candidate to be returned for that constituency and the first woman MP for a Liverpool seat. She was elected to the Labour Party national executive committee in 1947 and remained an MP until 1970, despite an attempt by her local party to oust her in 1955 because of her right-wing position.<br>
<br>Bessie Braddock became one of the notable personalities of the House of Commons, and in 1952 she was the first woman MP to be suspended from a sitting. Always outspoken&#151;and there were some who found her language over-rich for the Palace of Westminster&#151;she was defiant in her support of working people. She argued passionately for better housing, education, and welfare services for the poor, and was a particularly strong advocate of the National Health Service, making herself an expert on mental health. She was also a defender of the sport of boxing. A large woman, who confessed to weighing 15 stone, she championed the manufacture of outsize clothes at modest prices. She was not gracious to those whose arguments she rejected, whether they came from the opposition or her own party, as Aneurin Bevan and Michael Foot were both, at different times, to discover. Deeply antagonistic towards the left, she opposed Bevanism. When offered a post in the Labour government of 1964 she refused, saying that she could do more fighting for the government in Liverpool. Thus she stayed on the back benches, retained her roots in Merseyside, and fought for the people and ideals which she had always supported. She died in Liverpool on 13 November 1970.<br>
