</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobson, Sir  Richard Portway</span>  (1914&#150;1993), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 11 February 1914, at 64 Coldharbour Road, Bristol, in a family of four sons and one daughter of John Frederic Dobson (1875&#150;1947), professor of Greek at Bristol University, and his wife, Dina, elder daughter of Harry Harvey Portway, gentleman, of Bois Hall, Halstead, Essex. Dobson was educated at Clifton College and at King's College, Cambridge. On graduating he joined the British&#150;American Tobacco Company (BAT), in which he was to spend the greater part of his life as a businessman. He went almost immediately to China, which was at that time the most lucrative market for the company, and he remained there until late 1940.<br>
<br>BAT had been formed in 1902, to achieve a division of world markets between Imperial Tobacco and American Tobacco. The American James Buchanan Duke was chairman of BAT from its formation to 1923, when he was succeeded by Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, who remained in that post until 1945, when he became titular president. A Supreme Court judgment in 1911 had forced American Tobacco to sell its interest in BAT and by 1915 British interests held a majority of BAT shares. Cunliffe-Owen visited China in 1923 and created autonomous regional units of BAT (China) Ltd, designed to isolate the effects of localized difficulties from the business as a whole. He also negotiated at ministerial level on taxation and trading matters. After the communist takeover in 1949 BAT's Chinese interests were nationalized, having incurred strong nationalist criticism.<br>
<br>Dobson gave a breathless and at times rather jejune account of his time in China in <span class="italic">China Cycle</span>, published in 1946 by Macmillan in their <span class="roman">Centenary Books</span> series and awarded a supplementary prize of &pound;100 in the non-fiction category. The dust-wrapper referred to Dobson's &#145;robust, cheerful and friendly personality&#146; and these qualities would have been essential to endure the hardships and dangers of &#145;getting out in the field&#146; in a territory as vast and diverse as China, with an infrastructure at that time so incomplete as to render travel over long distances a dangerous as well as unpredictable activity. To these inherent problems were added those created by the Sino-Japanese War, but even in that context BAT's target was always &#145;business as usual&#146;  (Dobson, 56). Dobson described the cigarette trade in China as very active and complex  (ibid., 14), highly competitive, and only marginally profitable for its participants, from the supplying company down to the street-hawker, selling single cigarettes. Something of Dobson's boisterousness, which led to the famous gaffe which marked his later departure from British Leyland, will be found in <span class="italic">China Cycle</span>, although it has to be read in the context of its times: 1930s attitudes expressed in the subsequent wartime situation. Strongly critical of what he called the Asiatic &#145;disease of resignation&#146;  (ibid., 50), he advised the foreigner &#145;never [to] go further [towards the Chinese] than a bow and a smile and a shake of the hand&#146;  (ibid., 49), although his own account shows him to have been less remote than his advice suggests. Dobson considered that such Eurasians as those of Portuguese origin &#145;drift with the stream&#146;, although he was sufficiently fair to mention a few exceptions.<br>
<br>At the end of October 1940 Dobson prevailed on BAT to allow him to enlist, and after a voyage of eleven weeks he reached the United Kingdom. The process of acceptance as a trainee pilot in the RAF was lengthy, but in November 1941 Dobson departed for South Africa, for the training overseas for which he had opted. While there, he was critical of the treatment of the African population by the white community, but came to consider that &#145;the South African native in general cannot be compared, for intelligence, industry and virility, with the Chinese&#146;  (Dobson, 214). Active service finally came for Dobson as a Spitfire pilot with the rank of flight lieutenant, in the Italian campaign and then in the Far East. After the war, he rejected the idea of joining the Indian Civil Service and returned to BAT in 1946. On 3 May the same year, at Holy Trinity Church, Kensington, he married Emily Margaret (Betty) Carver, widow, the daughter of James Russell Herridge, chartered accountant; there was one daughter from her previous marriage.<br>
<br>Dobson worked for BAT in China and Rhodesia, and then at its London head office, where he rose to board level in 1955. He became deputy chairman in 1962, vice-chairman in 1968, and chairman in 1970, completing his life's work with BAT as president from 1976 to 1979. During these three decades, as Dobson rose to, and wielded, power, BAT prospered, often in a difficult economic and political climate. Not only was it necessary to adjust to such a major loss as that of the company's China business, but diversification of activity had to be embraced. BAT was over-dependent on a single product, especially as opposition to smoking on health grounds became a force to be reckoned with. Dobson himself made a point of posing for the camera with cigarette or pipe prominently in view and he had little time for medical or other criticism of BAT's activity. His management style as board chairman has been described as &#145;essentially that of a team leader, practising an &#147;open-door&#148; policy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Oct 1993). Criticism of BAT's activity, however, would not be tolerated by Dobson, whose reaction could be &#145;testy&#146;  (ibid.), and he firmly adhered to any course of action he had decided on. As Dobson had risen in the BAT hierarchy, the company took steps to reduce its heavy reliance on tobacco. In the 1960s and 1970s it acquired paper and packaging companies, such as Wiggins Teape, perfume and fragrance houses, such as Lenth&eacute;ric, and department stores. This diversity of interests led to a change of name to BAT Industries in 1976.<br>
<br>In February 1976, following the death of Sir Ronald Edwards, the non-executive chairman of the ailing vehicle manufacturer British Leyland (BL), Dobson, who had been awarded a knighthood in the new year's honours, accepted an invitation to take on the post. His eventual successor at BL, Michael Edwardes, chairman of Chloride, warned him at the time that the post as constituted was unlikely to work, and so it proved. Dobson's resignation eighteen months later appeared to be the result of some injudicious remarks of a racist nature made by him, which received unexpected publicity. At a businessmen's supper club at the Dorchester Hotel his speech was secretly recorded, and appeared in the International Marxist Group's <span class="italic">Socialist Challenge</span>. The adverse publicity for Dobson was, however, the pretext rather than the cause of his replacement by Michael Edwardes, for Edwardes had already been offered the post of chief executive at BL and had insisted on the combined role of chairman and chief executive. The robustness of character and bluntness of expression, marked already in the <span class="italic">China Cycle</span> and necessary for the head of a major international company in an era of change, was a precipitant of this unfortunate episode, which clouded the final stage of Dobson's business life. In the event Dobson resigned on 21 October 1977, the reputation of his long and successful career at BAT tarnished at least for a time by his unwise and unsuccessful venture into a very difficult industry at a time of crisis, and by an indiscretion which did less than justice to an articulate and capable businessman. However, Dobson continued to hold other directorships, including those of the American oil company Exxon and Lloyds Bank International. He also continued his interest in writing; at his memorial service readings were given from his poems. He died of respiratory failure and pneumonia, on 24 October 1993, at 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster.<br>
