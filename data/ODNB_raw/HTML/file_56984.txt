<span class="headword">Howard,  Peter Dunsmore</span>  (1908&#150;1965), <span class="occ">journalist and leader of Moral Re-Armament</span>, was born at 8 Laburnham Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire, on 20 December 1908, when his forenames were registered as Hereward Peter. He was the elder of two sons of Ebenezer Cecil Howard (1881&#150;1960), a preparatory school teacher who was also a non-practising barrister, and his wife, Evangeline Bohm (<i>d</i>. 1953), who was of Austrian descent. He was educated from 1916 at Crescent House School, Cliftonville, Brighton, of which his father was headmaster and part owner, and from 1922 at Mill Hill School, north London. In 1928 he entered Wadham College, Oxford, where much of his time was devoted to writing for <span class="italic">Isis</span>, the student newspaper, and especially, against considerable difficulties, to achieving success in rugby union. Howard had been born with a deformed left leg, which though straightened by an operation when a baby remained so thin that as a child he wore iron leg supports, and which left him with some lameness and a lopsided run. Nevertheless, assisted by being otherwise strong and over 6 feet in height, he drove himself to become a good back-row forward, playing for his school, then for Old Millhillians, Sussex, Oxford University (against Cambridge in 1929 and 1930), and England, winning eight caps during 1930&#150;31 and once acting as captain, and later for the Barbarians and Middlesex.<br>
<br>Having neglected his studies and with large debts, in early 1931 Howard left the university without taking a degree. While working as a private tutor in Switzerland he met Doris (Do&euml;) Metaxa (<i>b</i>. 1911), a leading French lawn tennis player, who in June 1932 shared the Wimbledon women's doubles title. They were married in Marseilles on 17 December 1932, and had two sons and a daughter. As Mrs P. D. Howard, Do&euml; continued to compete in international tennis tournaments until 1939. In that year her husband briefly returned to sport at the bobsleigh world championships at Cortina, in the British four-man team that broke the course record but came second overall.<br>
<br>Early in 1931 Howard joined Oswald Mosley's New Party, more for its energetic and youthful appeal than any formed political opinions, and in September Mosley employed him as secretary of its youth movement. He wrote for the party newspaper, <span class="italic">Action</span>, and during the October 1931 general election worked on Mosley's campaign tours as organizer of the stewards recruited to deal with left-wing counter-demonstrations, some of which led to violent scuffles in which Howard was involved. After the defeat of all New Party candidates, the party organization was reduced but Howard retained his post until its final disbandment in April 1932, on Mosley's turning definitely to fascism. Howard himself was never a blackshirt.<br>
<br>While training as a solicitor and supplementing his income as a rugby reporter for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, Howard came to the attention of the newspaper's owner, Lord Beaverbrook. From the summer of 1934 Beaverbrook employed him full-time as a political columnist, teaching him a distinctively terse, pungent, and populist prose style, and becoming a leading influence on Howard's life. Beaverbrook reinforced what Howard had learned from Mosley and visits to Glasgow slums during the 1931 election campaign: disrespect towards established politicians of all parties. His political journalism was &#145;of the most bludgeoning character&#146;  (Howard, 16), sardonic, contrary, and amusing, exposing the private personalities behind the public reputations. He also acted as Beaverbrook's voice, upholding his causes and expressing his enmities, especially towards the Conservative leader, Stanley Baldwin. Howard became feared, admired, and very successful, from 1937 writing also for Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> on a wide variety of subjects and under various pseudonyms. By 1939 he was among the highest paid journalists in Fleet Street and able to buy a farm near Brent Eleigh in Suffolk. From May 1940, however, Beaverbrook's appointment in Churchill's wartime coalition government placed pressure on Howard and his colleagues to curb their political polemics. This became particularly irksome after the British army's defeat and evacuation from Dunkirk. Sharing a widespread dismay at the defence and foreign policies which seemed to have produced this military disaster, in July 1940 three <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> leader writers&#151;Frank Owen, Michael Foot, and Howard&#151;under the pseudonym Cato published <span class="italic">Guilty Men</span>, a diatribe against the 1930s governments of Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain. Reprinted many times, it helped to crystallize a wartime disillusionment with the Conservative Party and to establish an enduring popular myth of the National Government's &#145;failure&#146; to recognize and rearm against the threat from Nazi Germany [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/70401', "Guilty men")</script>].<br>
<br>Still unhappy with restraints on his political journalism, later in 1940 Howard was introduced to members of the Oxford Group, the Christian renewal movement. Considering himself an atheist, he intended to write an expos&eacute; of an organization suspected by most journalists of pacifism or pro-Nazi sympathies; but he not only became convinced that the suspicions were false but underwent a form of religious and moral conversion. In disputed circumstances, in April 1941 he resigned from the Express newspapers in order to publish a defence of the Oxford Group, or <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96078', "Moral Re-Armament (MRA)")</script> as it became more widely known. This book, <span class="italic">Innocent Men</span>, also promoted its cause of personal transformation by &#145;listening&#146; to and &#145;surrendering&#146; to God, and by adherence to four &#145;absolutes&#146; of honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love. In characteristic Oxford Group style he apologized to his family and associates for past unkindnesses, in August 1941 even travelling to Worcestershire to apologize to Baldwin. He also sought Baldwin's aid, unsuccessfully, for a campaign to exempt the group's workers from military conscription, which prompted him to write a further defence of the movement, <span class="italic">Fighters Ever</span> (1942). Howard's main occupation and source of income was now farming, but as the war ended he resumed his writing, though from 1941 all his royalties went to MRA. <span class="italic">Men on Trial</span> (1945) was a collection of political sketches, but <span class="italic">Ideas on Legs</span> (also 1945) took up MRA's widest themes: moral renewal of individuals as the means to resist the &#145;organised, militant Materialism&#146; that lay at the root of both fascism and communism, and to create a new social order under &#145;God control&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1946 Howard travelled to the United States to meet the MRA leader, Frank Buchman, the second and greatest influence on his career. He joined an MRA mission that over six months visited some twenty North American cities, and for the rest of his life toured the world as an MRA evangelist, often working in the USA but also visiting many western European countries and various Asian and African nations, as MRA widened its appeal to members of other religious faiths. Howard also became the leading MRA publicist, not just with further books (including two on Buchman), but also from 1954 as author of fifteen plays and musicals. These were overtly propaganda pieces, dramatizing MRA's values and appeals, and often the focus of its campaigns: <span class="italic">Vanishing Island</span> (1955) was part of a &#145;world mission&#146;, performed in eighteen countries. Many thousands of people across the world bought Howard's books and saw his plays, as during the cold war MRA offered an ideology to resist communism and preserve democracy, an appeal that won attention from political leaders in many countries, including the USA. In Britain it remained controversial and attracted little political interest, but had substantial numbers of supporters and was an important influence over Mary Whitehouse and her Clean-Up TV campaign and National Viewers' and Listeners' Association. Howard anticipated some of the Whitehouse criticisms in <span class="italic">Britain and the Beast</span> (1963), attacking more permissive sexual attitudes as a dangerous immorality that corrupted the nation's public life. His last book was a study of Beaverbrook (1964), with whom he had resumed his friendship and who contributed to and revised the text: Howard gave it the unlikely implication that Beaverbrook might yet &#145;become an Oxford Grouper&#146;  (Taylor, 677).<br>
<br>After Buchman's death in August 1961 Howard became the international leader of MRA. In early 1962 his daughter Anne's engagement to Patrick Wolrige-Gordon, the MP for East Aberdeen, attracted much political attention, because it precipitated an unsuccessful attempt by the constituency's Unionist association, already critical of the time Wolrige-Gordon spent on MRA activities, to have him deselected as their candidate at the next election. Howard's last tour for MRA was to South America, where he died of viral pneumonia on 25 February 1965 in Lima, Peru. After a funeral service on 4 March 1965 at St Peter and St Paul's Church, Lavenham, he was buried in Brent Eleigh churchyard. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 12 April 1965.<br>
