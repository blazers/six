<span class="headword">Das, Chittaranjan</span>  (1870&#150;1925), <span class="occ">Indian nationalist and barrister</span>, was born on 5 November 1870 in Calcutta, the second child and eldest son of Bhuban Mohan Das, a solicitor of the Calcutta high court, and his wife, Nistarini Devi. His youngest brother, P. R. Das, became a judge of the Patna high court.<br>
<br>Das was educated at the London Missionary Society Institution, Bhowanipore, Calcutta, and then at Presidency College, Calcutta, one of the foremost colleges of India. He sailed to England in 1890 to take the Indian Civil Service examination. However, he failed in this effort, and changed course and entered the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar in 1893 and upon his return to India enrolled as a barrister at the Calcutta high court. After paying off large debts left by his father he gradually became one of the highest-paid Indian barristers, and amassed considerable wealth.<br>
<br>In 1897 he married Basanti Devi, the daughter of Barada Nath Haldar, diwan of Bijni estate in Assam. Basanti Devi played some part in nationalist politics and she, along with her son Chitta Ranjan Das, her husband, and many political activists, was arrested during the 1921 non-co-operation movement. Basanti Devi lived until May 1974.<br>
<br>As a lawyer Das made his early successes in the <i>mofussil</i>, or local courts, outside Calcutta. He took up civil and criminal cases, but became famous in India at first for his passionate and shrewd defences of Indian nationalists charged with terrorism in political cases, the most famous of which was the Alipore bomb case of 1908. In this case he defended Aurobindo Ghose, public political leader and secret revolutionary theorist. Das gained an acquittal for Ghose, who two years later flew to Pondicherry and later became known as the guru and philosopher Sri Aurobindo.<br>
<br>Das participated in politics from his student days in England and was linked to the extremist party in the Indian National Congress from 1905 onwards. However, the moderate group was more successful in outlasting the extremists, who fell into disarray from about 1910. Das continued his legal work and sporadic political participation and re-emerged in 1917 as a leader of a revitalized Indian National Congress in Bengal.<br>
<br>By 1919 he became the foremost nationalist in the Bengal Congress at about the time that M. K. Gandhi came to the leadership of the national Congress. Das at first opposed Gandhi's call for non-co-operation, but then, as Gandhi demonstrated his political skill and wide support, Das joined with him in energizing the national non-co-operation campaign of 1920 to 1922. Das was arrested in 1921 and was in gaol when Gandhi called off the campaign because of acts of violence by Indian nationalists.<br>
<br>Angered by what he believed was short-sightedness and incorrect strategy by Gandhi, Das, together with Motilal Nehru, father of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, founded the Swaraj party. This party operated within the Congress as an opposition group to Gandhi's loyal supporters, and outside the Congress as a party participating in the elections to the provincial legislative councils and the central legislative assembly from 1923. Their strategy was to deadlock the councils from within, and both Das in the Bengal legislative council and the elder Nehru in the central legislative assembly had considerable success.<br>
<br>Das was also elected mayor of Calcutta in 1924 under the revised <span class="roman">Calcutta Municipal Act</span>. He flourished from 1923 to 1925 as leader of the Bengal Congress, leader of the opposition in the Bengal legislative council, mayor of the second city of the British empire, and national president of the Swaraj party. Part of his effort in all these roles was to have Hindus and Muslims work together and to this end he had formulated the Bengal pact of December 1923. The pact specified how this co-operation was to be achieved, <i>inter alia</i>, through additional places for Muslims in public employment. It was utilized in Bengal, but not accepted by the national Congress. As the political leader of a province in which Muslims had a slight majority, Das believed he needed Muslim help to achieve the goals he sought, and for this brief period he had a good deal of Muslim support.<br>
<br>At the height of his political success his health began to fail and he retreated to his mountain home in Darjeeling in May 1925. Gandhi visited him there. On 16 June 1925, succumbing to severe fever, he died. Gandhi led the enormous funeral procession in Calcutta, and said:<blockquote>Deshbandhu [friend of the country] was one of the greatest of men &hellip; He dreamed &hellip; and talked of freedom of India and of nothing else &hellip; His heart knew no difference between Hindus and Mussalmans and I should like to tell Englishmen, too, that he bore no ill-will to them. (Gandhi, <span class="italic">Collected Works</span> 27.250)</blockquote>Throughout his life Das was religious, and was attracted to the emotional Vaishnava Hinduism of Bengal which stressed the centrality of the principle of love. He wrote several books of religious poetry in Bengali, one of which was translated into English by Aurobindo Ghose as <span class="italic">Songs of the Sea</span> (1920). As a passionate Bengali who loved his country and was himself non-violent, he opposed, but did not disown, some of the Bengalis who turned to acts of violence. He preferred open political work inside and outside government institutions aiming for the independence of his country.<br>
