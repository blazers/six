<span class="headword">Petre, Sir  Edward</span>, third baronet  (1630<span class="mult">x</span>33&#150;1699), <span class="occ">Jesuit and courtier</span>, was born in London, possibly on 4 March 1633, the second son of Sir Francis Petre (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;1658), first baronet, of Cranham Hall, Essex, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1655), daughter of Sir John Gage, first baronet, of Firle Place, Sussex. However, his apparent age at death suggests that he may have been born in 1630/31. His great-grandfather was John, first Baron Petre (1549&#150;1613). Petre was educated at the college at St Omer from about 1644 until 1652. He entered the Society of Jesus at Watten on 1 March 1653 under the name of Spencer. He then studied philosophy and theology at Li&egrave;ge, 1655&#150;64, during which time he was ordained a priest, on 22 October 1662. After spending some time in England he professed the four vows on 2 February 1671. He seems to have returned to England in 1672, and served as rector of the Hampshire district in 1678&#150;9.<br>
<br>At this point Petre became embroiled in the Popish Plot. It was a letter from Petre which gave credence to the claim made by Titus Oates that a Jesuit consult had been held in London in April 1678. Petre was arrested, brought before the privy council, and committed to Newgate in September 1678. By January 1679 Petre had succeeded his elder brother, Francis, to the baronetcy. Petre was not tried with other alleged conspirators in June 1679, some people later claiming that he was under the protection of the duke of York, possibly for services rendered in the upbringing of York's illegitimate children, but it was probably because Petre was slated for trial with the Staffordshire plotters which had been delayed as there was only a single witness against Lord Aston. Petre was released on bail in June 1680. In August 1680 he became rector of the London district and vice-provincial of England until a new one could safely be appointed, but in October 1680 he again found himself in prison, being released on 6 February 1683.<br>
<br>The accession of James II in February 1685 transformed Petre's situation. He was called to court and appointed dean of the new Chapel Royal in St James's Palace. Petre possessed &#145;a fair smooth tongue, and a very affable way of flattery&#146;, both attributes useful at court  (Marshall, 144). However, Petre had no experience of court politics and was &#145;to state affairs a perfect novice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.128). This made him an easy target for the machinations of a shrewd political operator like Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, who used Petre as an ally in his pursuit of power and more specifically the dismissal from office of his rivals the Hyde brothers. Further, Petre was &#145;puffed up with &hellip; vanity and ambition&#146;, which made him yearn for recognition within the church  (Marshall, 144). Initially Petre wanted James II to procure him a bishopric but in November 1685 Pope Innocent XI refused the king's request, noting that Jesuits were not allowed to hold high office. Not that this rebuff deterred James as he continued to instruct his representative in Rome, Roger Palmer, first earl of Castlemaine, to press the pope in the matter. Eventually in June 1687 James accepted that a bishopric was out of the question and changed his request to ask for a cardinal's hat for Petre instead. Again he met without success.<br>
<br>Petre's perceived influence at court was evinced by the number of requests for patronage he received. One observer noted that Petre's &#145;antechambers were crowded with petitioners, for they found by experience if he undertook their business it seldom failed to prosper&#146;  (Marshall, 145). More formal recognition followed when on 5 November 1687 Petre was named to succeed Thomas Sprat as clerk of the closet. On 11 November he was sworn a member of the privy council. However, this merely regularized his position as an adviser and did not enhance his influence. Petre was also a member of the commission charged with regulating the corporations of the parliamentary boroughs in order to influence the composition of any new parliament. Gradually he moved beyond Sunderland's influence and supported the court faction grouped around the more extreme Catholics such as the earl of Melfort. Petre was a proponent of severe measures being taken against the fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1687&#150;8.<br>
<br>The birth of the prince of Wales in June 1688 led to a host of scurrilous diatribes accusing Petre of involvement in a plot to switch babies in order to produce a male heir for the king. Petre advised a conciliatory approach to the petition of the seven bishops as he foresaw that punitive action would rebound against the government. With a Dutch invasion expected James refused to banish Petre from court, and as late as 22 October 1688 the king told the earls of Clarendon and Nottingham that should they return to the privy council he would ensure that Petre would not attend its meetings, but would not dismiss him. By the end of November 1688 Narcissus Luttrell reported that Petre had sent &#145;several great chests from Whitehall&#146; ready for his departure  (Luttrell, 1.480). He soon made his escape from London and fled to France. He never saw James II again.<br>
<br>Petre soon left France, for he was reported to be in Rome in December 1689, &#145;but is not much looked on there&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.616). In both 1691 and 1692 he was back in France, at Abbeville. In 1693 he was appointed rector at St Omer. In 1697 he retired to Watten, where he died on 15 May 1699, apparently aged sixty-eight. His sister, Mary Petre, took out administration of his will on 17 May 1699. As baronet Petre was succeeded in turn by his brothers Thomas and William; following the death of the latter in 1722 the baronetcy became extinct. His younger brother Charles (1644&#150;1712) had most closely followed Petre's career, being educated at St Omer and serving the Jesuits in the English mission.<br>
<br>Petre's importance at the court of James II arose from his closeness to the king. The earl of Sunderland was able to utilize Petre's influence in order to manoeuvre the Anglican earl of Rochester from office. Gradually Petre moved free from Sunderland's influence, particularly as he felt that the earl was responsible for his failure to secure that which he coveted the most: preferment in the church. Indeed the earl of Ailesbury characterized him as &#145;a hot-headed ignorant churchman&#146;, who &#145;had nothing in view but a cardinal's hat&#146;  (Miller, <span class="italic">Popery</span>, 235&#150;6). For the English he remained a &#145;bogey-man&#146;, commonly being burnt in effigy on 5 November each year. His papers were transferred from St Omer to Bruges but were lost in October 1773 when the Austrian government suppressed the Jesuits.<br>
