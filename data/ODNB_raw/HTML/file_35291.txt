<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Patrick</span> <span class="st"> [P&aacute;draic Ua Domhnaill]</span>  (1856&#150;1927), <span class="occ">cardinal</span>, was born on 28 November 1856 at Kilraine, near Glenties, co. Donegal, the second son of nine children of Daniel O'Donnell, tenant farmer, and Mary Breslin, of Gortlosk, co. Donegal. He was educated at the local national school and the high school at Letterkenny. He was nominated for a place at the Pontificio Collegio Irlandese, Rome, but was sent instead in 1873 to the faculty of arts and science in the Catholic University, Dublin. In 1875 he entered St Patrick's College, Maynooth, and in 1879 became a student of the Dunboyne Establishment. In 1880 he was ordained and was appointed to a chair in theology. During his time at Maynooth he contributed a number of articles to the <span class="italic">Irish Ecclesiastical Record</span>. In 1884 he was appointed prefect of the Dunboyne Establishment. In 1888, at the unusually young age of thirty-two, he was appointed to the see of Raphoe, comprising most of co. Donegal.<br>
<br>As bishop of Raphoe, O'Donnell was energetic in both religious and secular affairs. During his episcopate the ancient cathedral chapter was re-established by Pope Leo XIII in 1901 and St Eunan (St Adomn&aacute;n) was declared joint patron saint of the diocese with St Columba. The cathedral was opened in 1901, and new schools and churches were built. On 28 April 1922 he was installed as coadjutor, with the title archbishop of Attalia, to Cardinal Michael Logue, whom he succeeded as primate in November 1924. In December 1925 he was created cardinal and took the title Santa Maria Della Pace. On his return to Ireland from Rome he was greeted by President Cosgrave, two government ministers, a guard of honour of fifty men, and a pipe band. As he travelled north to Armagh he was welcomed by groups ranging from the Gaelic League and Knights of Columbanus to the Royal Ulster Rifles. He attended the International Eucharistic Congress in Chicago in 1926 and received a warm welcome from Irish Americans. His final religious event of major significance was a plenary synod of the Irish hierarchy at Maynooth in August 1927.<br>
<br>As bishop of Raphoe&#151;a diocese frequently afflicted by famine&#151;O'Donnell took a keen interest in the plight of the small farmer. He was a member of the congested districts board from its establishment in 1896 to its dissolution in 1923, and a member of the royal commission on congested districts in 1906. He also promoted the revival of the cloth-making industry in Donegal.<br>
<br>O'Donnell took a keen interest in national politics and was actively involved in the Irish parliamentary party. He retained the confidence of both sides when the party split following the death of Parnell and he helped promote reunion. He presided at the Irish Race Convention in January 1896, and was the only bishop present. O'Donnell supported the United Irish League, which was to become the constituency organization of the Irish parliamentary party, but had some difficulty in leading his clergy to support it. He was responsible for the removal of the hierarchy's ban on the Ancient Order of Hibernians in 1904 and this organization was to form an important part of the party's political machine in the north-east. O'Donnell was appointed a trustee of the reunited party and was to prove a valuable adviser to leader John Redmond until 1918. Between 1917 and 1918 he was one of four episcopal representatives in the Irish Convention which deliberated on an Irish settlement. There he argued strongly in favour of fiscal autonomy. He rejected a compromise suggested by Redmond and led the nationalists in the convention when Redmond withdrew. Before the post-war election of 1918 he suggested that all Irish party members withdraw from the election, a suggestion John Dillon rejected. After the eclipse of the party in the 1918 election O'Donnell maintained a close friendship with leading party members Dillon and Joe Devlin.<br>
<br>While O'Donnell always considered partition lamentable, he realized at an early stage that some form of exclusion of the north-east from home rule might be inevitable and warned against any form of autonomy which might have detrimental effects on Catholic education. Strictly constitutional in the methods he espoused, O'Donnell kept his distance from Sinn F&eacute;in during the struggle for independence, unlike some of his episcopal colleagues. His statements increasingly dealt with human rights issues rather than party politics. During the civil war he tried in vain to prevent the execution of Erskine Childers, who had helped him during the Irish Convention of 1917&#150;18. In 1924 he appealed for the release of political prisoners both north and south. The following year he spoke of the obligation of both governments to protect the rights of minorities. When the boundaries of the Northern Irish state had been settled, he urged Catholics to use legitimate means to further their objectives and expressed hope in the goodwill of unionists.<br>
<br>A fluent Irish speaker, O'Donnell sought in many ways to promote the language. As bishop he issued pastoral letters in Irish as well as English. He expounded his views on the language question in the preface he wrote for the autobiography of another language enthusiast, An tAthair Peadar Ua Laoghaire. In Letterkenny, O'Donnell clashed with the Gaelic League when their fund-raising for an Irish college for teachers conflicted with his campaign for St Eunan's Cathedral. O'Donnell established his own Irish college for teachers and his own Irish-language organization, the Crann Eithne. Nevertheless, the rift was not permanent and in 1926 he supported a Gaelic League proposal for a separate Irish-language organization in Northern Ireland. He frequently spoke at Feis Th&iacute;r Chonaill in promotion of the language.<br>
<br>O'Donnell was involved in a variety of educational initiatives during his life. He was rector of the Catholic University, a member of the governing body of the Catholic school of medicine, and member of the governing body of the National University of Ireland, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in law in 1915. In 1918 he represented the bishops on the vice-regal committee of inquiry into primary education (the Killanin committee). As primate his relations with Lord Londonderry, the first minister of education in Northern Ireland, were cordial. Together they resolved the impasse reached in relation to the provision of teacher training for Catholic males by sending them to St Mary's College, Hammersmith. He made suggestions to the Northern Ireland ministry of education on the teaching of Irish to young children, and expressed his concerns about school buildings to both Belfast and Dublin governments.<br>
<br>O'Donnell was generally recognized as handsome, with a charming manner. He was frequently described as &#145;of princely bearing&#146; and was a skilled orator. He was a fine swimmer and a keen walker. His enduring fault, however, was his notoriously bad handwriting, which unfortunately rendered his copious writings on political issues a trial for his contemporaries and for later researchers. He died at his summer residence at Carlingford, co. Louth, on 22 October 1927. The immediate cause of death was an embolism, but he had also been suffering from pneumonia and had developed pleurisy. He was buried in St Patrick's cemetery, Armagh, on the 28th. During his lifetime he was known to respect the views of his political opponents and was seen by many protestants as a force for reconciliation. O'Donnell had been impressed at the healing of old political divisions he witnessed during his visit to the United States in 1926 and hoped for similar reconciliation in Ireland. On the day of his death the bells of both Catholic and protestant cathedrals in Armagh tolled for him. After his death the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span> described him as &#145;an honourable opponent&#146;.<br>
