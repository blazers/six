<span class="headword">Searchfield,  Rowland</span>  (1564/5&#150;1622), <span class="occ">bishop of Bristol</span>, was probably born in London. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1575 to 1582, when, aged seventeen, he went to St John's College, Oxford, of which he was later made a fellow. He graduated BA on 11 October 1586 and proceeded MA on 2 June 1590.<br>
<br>Granted leave of absence by his college in February 1594 to preach in London, Searchfield reportedly delivered about twenty sermons, including one at Paul's Cross. On his return to Oxford he became university proctor in April 1596 and gained his BD degree on 30 June the same year. John Manningham described him, while at Oxford in 1602/3, as &#145;a dissembled Christian, like an intemperate patient which can gladly heare his physicion discourse of his dyet and remedy, but will not endure to obserue them&#146;  (11). However, when Searchfield resigned his fellowship on 26 November 1606 St John's granted him &pound;10 &#145;in consideration that he hath taken great pains in writing of many things for the college, and done many good and commendable services for the college&#146;  (Stevenson and Salter, 362). In his thesis for his DD degree, gained on 1 June 1608, Searchfield argued that various forms of religion were incompatible with unity of faith, that no one could be saved by the faith of another, and that heretics should be compelled to conform outwardly.<br>
<br>In 1600 Searchfield had become rector of Eastleach Martin, Gloucestershire, an incumbency he held for the rest of his life. On 3 December 1600 he was also presented to the living of Emly, but resigned ten months later in 1601 and became vicar of Evenley, Northamptonshire, and rector of Burthrop, Gloucestershire. The distractions of Oxford no doubt underlie an indictment for prolonged absence from his parish during Bishop Thomas Ravis's 1605 visitation of Gloucester diocese. In 1606 Searchfield became vicar of Charlbury, Oxfordshire, where he was made a JP. Having been earlier unsuccessful in an attempt to gain appointment as a chaplain to the new archbishop, Richard Bancroft, he became a chaplain-in-ordinary to James I before whom he preached Lenten sermons on 8 April 1617 and 17 March 1622.<br>
<br>Searchfield was nominated bishop of Bristol on 12 March 1619 and consecrated on 9 May. During his primary episcopal visitation, on Holy Cross day 1619, he consecrated the chapel of Chantmarle Manor near Cattistock, Dorset, &#145;where he confirmed five hundred people, young and old, until he was so weary that he left some unconfirmed, and escaped to his bed at Melbury&#146;  (Fincham, 128). Searchfield supported his clergy's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to increase their inadequate stipends by appealing to the citizens of Bristol for a contribution towards their maintenance. With his wife, Anne, daughter of Ralph and Mary Hutchinson of Oxfordshire, Searchfield had a son, also Rowland, who later became a prominent Bristol citizen. Searchfield died on 11 October 1622, probably in Bristol, and was buried in the sanctuary of Bristol Cathedral. Following renovations there in the 1680s, a memorial stone to him was placed in the north transept wall.<br>
