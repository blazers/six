<span class="headword">Power,  Richard</span>  (1724&#150;1794), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the second of three sons of John Power (<i>d</i>. 1743), a landowner of Barretstown, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of the Revd John Congreve. A member of the Church of Ireland, he was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, entered the Middle Temple in 1752, and was called to the Irish bar in 1757. He became usher of the court of chancery in 1763, and a king's counsel in 1768, receiving the degree of doctor of laws <i>honoris causa</i> from Trinity in 1769. He was MP for Monaghan Borough (1767&#150;8) and for Tuam, co. Galway (1768&#150;72), purchasing his seat on both occasions. Noted in <span class="italic">Baratariana</span> as a prominent supporter of the Townshend administration (1767&#150;72), and a close associate of Sir George Macartney, chief secretary (1769&#150;72), he was lampooned for his verbose and theatrical speeches. On one occasion in the House of Commons he made a vigorous attack on William Blackstone, and damaged a copy of Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> by thumping it against the benches while displaying &#145;the vociferation of a Bedlamite and gesture and attitude nicely copied from the state kettle-drummer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Baratariana</span>, 152). In another debate he showed more statesmanlike qualities by making a speech of great clarity, in favour of the administration, to explain an important alteration to a controversial money bill of 1769; the bill, however, was rejected by the Commons because it was not drawn up in that chamber, leading Townshend to prorogue parliament until February 1771. The pamphlet <span class="italic">A Comparative State of the Two Rejected Money Bills in 1692 and 1769</span> (1770) has been attributed to Power.<br>
<br>During his parliamentary career Power made little secret of his desire to be a judge, and he was rewarded for his loyalty to the Townshend administration by being appointed second baron of the court of the exchequer in 1772, while retaining his chancery position. Some observers regarded his behaviour on the bench as excessively austere, but his defenders claimed that this was simply a result of his insistence on legal precision and regularity. When Lord Carlisle and William Eden came to office in December 1780 they immediately decided to assert their authority, and in May 1781 recommended Power's dismissal on the grounds of his continued absence from duty, but he managed to hold onto his offices.<br>
<br>From 1771 to 1794 Power lived successively in Stephen's Street and Kildare Street, Dublin; he was well known as a connoisseur of the fine arts in Dublin. It was thought that he would probably receive a peerage in 1791 but this came to nothing. A contemporary described him as &#145;a morose, fat fellow, affecting to be genteel: he was very learned, very rich, and very ostentatious&#146;  (Gilbert, 3.290). Much of his fortune came from the lucrative office of usher of the court of chancery, a position mainly remunerated by interest which accrued on lodgements in the court. In a case between the duke of Chandos and his tenants, Power was entrusted with a large sum of money lodged by the tenants under a court order. After several years the tenants won and were declared entitled to the fund. Power returned the principal but, in right of his office, withheld the interest, which amounted to almost &pound;3000. The tenants presented a petition against this to the lord chancellor, John Fitzgibbon, who ordered Power to appear before him on 5 February 1794 to explain his actions. Power remonstrated strongly against this summons, claiming that as a judge he should not be subject to such an indignity, but the chancellor insisted on seeing him. An arrogant man, Power had often clashed with the equally arrogant Fitzgibbon, and the prospect of appearing before him threw him into a panic. According to one account Power then decided to murder Fitzgibbon  (Daunt, 2.146), and drove to his house at Ely Place with a pair of loaded pistols in his pockets. Not finding Fitzgibbon at home Power then resolved on suicide; friends believed that two recent bouts of illness had also influenced his resolve to die.<br>
<br>On Sunday 2 February 1794 he spent the morning arranging his papers and made his will. Accompanied by his groom he rode to Dublin's South Wall, one of his favourite rides, where he dismounted and instructed his servant to walk the horse to Ringsend to await his return. Power waited until he was alone, then filled his pockets with pebbles, walked into the sea, and was drowned. It was said that he carried an umbrella to protect himself from the rain as he walked off the pier. His body was discovered next day on the strand, near the Pigeonhouse. Although it was widely known in Dublin that he had committed suicide, the coroner's jury recorded a verdict of accidental death. His fortune was estimated at &pound;60,000: he left &pound;10,000 of this to Lord Macartney, his patron in the Townshend administration, and, as he had no children, the remainder went to his nephews. His elder brother, Ambrose Power of Barretstown, had been killed by the Whiteboys in 1775; his younger brother, John Power of Tullamaine, co. Tipperary, was aide-de-camp to Lord Clive at the battle of Plassey.<br>
