<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arnold,  John</span>  (1735/6&#150;1799), <span class="occ">watch and chronometer maker</span>, was the son of John Arnold (1702&#150;1776), clockmaker, of Bodmin, Cornwall. He was apprenticed to his father and probably worked briefly for his uncle William Arnold, a gunsmith, before going to the Netherlands about 1755. There he improved his knowledge of clockmaking and learned German, a language which later proved useful to him in the Hanoverian court. He returned to England about 1757 and apparently earned his living as an itinerant mechanic until he repaired a repeating watch for William McGuire of St Albans, who was so impressed by his skill that he lent Arnold the money to set himself up in business in Westminster. He opened his first shop at Devereux Court, Strand, in May 1762, moving in 1769 to St James's Street, and in 1771 to 2 Adam Street, Adelphi. Arnold and his wife, Margaret (1743/4&#150;1789), had a son, John Roger Arnold, born on 13 February 1769; he was apprenticed to his father and succeeded him in business.<br>
<br>In 1764 Arnold was introduced at court and presented George III with a miniature watch set in a ring, for which he received &pound;500, the first of several payments for royal services. In 1767 Arnold took up the manufacture of marine timekeepers, as recently developed by John Harrison. Three which he supplied for James Cook's second voyage of 1772 did not perform well, but his later improvements bore fruit and by simplifying their design he considerably reduced their price. He also made several fine regulator clocks for observatory use, besides other domestic clocks and watches. Arnold took a shop at 102 Cornhill, in the City of London, in 1783, and became a member of the Clockmakers' Company the same year, being admitted to the livery in 1796.<br>
<br>Arnold is generally credited with having originated the helical spring and terminal curves for which he obtained patents in 1775 and 1782 respectively. The specification of 1775 included the first patent in any country for a compensation balance. His celebrated watch no. 36 was his first to incorporate such a balance and astonished the astronomers at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with its fine timekeeping. Arnold and his supporter the hydrographer Alexander Dalrymple noted in a published account of the watch's trial that they had coined a new term, &#145;chronometer&#146;, especially for it, the first use of that term in its modern sense. The patent of 1782 includes a form of spring detent escapement, though it seems likely that this design was taken by Arnold from an earlier version by Thomas Earnshaw, described to Arnold the previous year. Nevertheless, Arnold's reputation as one of Britain's most significant chronometer makers rests on the originality of his designs. His timekeepers were sold to discriminating private customers, as well as to the British Admiralty and the East India Company. Mercer's description of Arnold as &#145;shy and perhaps a little nervous&#146;  (p. 145) is contradicted by contemporary accounts. Thomas Mouat, a Shetlander who met Arnold when he was travelling to London in 1775 with a minister, reported &#145;Our companion happened to be the famous Arnold, who made a watch in the stone of the King's ring: his conversation was animated, blustering and much adorned with oaths, which were too frequent for Mr Stewart's ease&#146;  (Bamford, 108). In a letter to a client in 1786 the instrument dealer and agent J. H. Magellan referred to Arnold as the great talker&#151;&#145;le grand bavard&#146;  (Leopold, 500)&#151;and William Ludlam, Lucasian professor of mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, remarked in 1784, &#145;from accounts I had, I once thought he was one of those people who talk much and do little, but since I have seen what he has actually done I have far different thoughts&#146;  (&#145;Report&#146;, 96&#150;7).<br>
<br>From about 1783 Arnold took his son as an apprentice and into partnership, trading as John Arnold &amp; Son, and in 1792 sent him to Paris to work with the esteemed clockmaker Abraham Louis Breguet until the revolution obliged him to return to London. From 1779 Arnold ran his workshops and resided at Well Hall, Eltham, and after his retirement in 1796 his son continued the business at the Cornhill shop. Arnold died at Well Hall on 25 August 1799 and was buried in the parish churchyard at Chislehurst, Kent, with his wife, who predeceased him.<br>
