<span class="headword">Lorimer,  John Gordon</span>  (1870&#150;1914), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at 6 Woodside Place, Glasgow, on 14 June 1870, the son of Robert Lorimer, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Isabella Lockhart Cornish Robertson. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58306/', "David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer")</script> was his younger brother. While an undergraduate at Edinburgh University, Lorimer was selected for the Indian Civil Service, and subsequently spent a year at Christ Church, Oxford (1889&#150;90), following the course for Indian Civil Service probationers. He served as assistant commissioner in various parts of the Punjab between 1891 and 1897, and held a number of other administrative positions, mostly on the north-west frontier until his appointment to the foreign department of the government of India in Simla, where he served briefly from 1899 to 1900 and then between 1904 and 1908. On 8 October 1903, while on leave in Edinburgh, he married Marian Agnes Maclean (<i>b</i>. 1875/6), daughter of George Campbell Maclean, secretary of the Scottish Amicable Assurance Society; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Lorimer is known principally for his massive compilation in six volumes entitled <span class="italic">Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia</span>, published by the government of India in 1908 and 1915, based on &#145;personal enquiries carried out between 1902 and 1906&#146;  (Wilson, 79). The <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span>, republished in 1970, is part geographical and navigational handbook, part historical survey, and part detailed account of Britain's relations with the Ottomans and the other political authorities in Arabia and the Gulf. It is the fullest account of the state of knowledge of the region in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and as such is still an important tool for researchers. Its principal drawback, noted by a leading Russian scholar, is that Lorimer does not always quote his sources, so that it is not clear whether he is relying on the published work of travellers or on less publicly accessible reports from British consular and other agents  (Vassiliev, 18). In that sense the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> needs to be supplemented by the various works by his contemporary, J. A. Saldanha, such as <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;cis of Koweit Affairs, 1896&#150;1904</span> (Simla, 1904) and <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;cis of Nejd Affairs, 1804&#150;1904</span> (Simla, 1904). The <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> remained &#145;on the &#147;secret&#148; list until 1930 when it was declassified, but marked &#147;for official use only&#148;&#146;  (Winstone, 58).<br>
<br>In 1909 the foreign department of the government of India appointed Lorimer political resident in Turkish Arabia, stationed at Baghdad; in April 1911 he became consul-general. Like his friend and contemporary Captain Shakespear, Lorimer felt that Britain should take due note of the weakening Ottoman position in northern Arabia and commit itself more firmly to the rising star of Ibn Sa&#145;ud.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1914 Lorimer died at Bushehr while cleaning a loaded gun: his colleague and contemporary Arnold Wilson noted that his death &#145;deprived the Government of India of one of its most brilliant servants&#146;  (Wilson, 79). In addition to the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span>, Lorimer published <span class="italic">Customary Law of the Main Tribes in the Peshawar District</span> (Lahore, 1899) and <span class="italic">Grammar and Vocabulary of Waziri Pashto</span> (Calcutta, 1902).<br>
