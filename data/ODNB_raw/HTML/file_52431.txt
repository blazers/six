<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spence,  Catherine Helen</span>  (1825&#150;1910), <span class="occ">writer and reformer in Australia</span>, was born on 31 October 1825 near Melrose, Scotland, the fifth of the eight children of David Spence (1789&#150;1846), a writer, solicitor, and banker, and Helen Brodie (1791&#150;1887). Her parents were both Scots and members of the established Church of Scotland. She attended Miss Sarah Phinn's protestant day school, St Mary's Convent, in Melrose, but plans for her to attend an advanced school for girls in Edinburgh failed when financial collapse compelled the family to emigrate to South Australia in 1839.<br>
<br>Determined not to add to the numbers she believed predestined to eternal damnation, and pleased at her first earnings from working as a governess, Spence decided against marriage and motherhood, though she brought up three families of other people's children in the course of her life. After a brief attempt to set up a school, she embarked upon the multifaceted career which led, by her eightieth birthday, to the announcement that she was &#145;the most distinguished woman they had had in Australia&#146;  (Sir Samuel James Way, quoted in <span class="italic">Catherine Helen Spence</span>).<br>
<br>Spence's career as a novelist stretched from the publication of <span class="italic">Clara Morison: a Tale of South Australia during the Gold Fever</span>, in 1854, until 1888&#150;9, when her future-vision novella &#145;A Week in the Future&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Centennial Magazine</span> in Sydney. During the intervening years she produced five novels and a religious allegory. Neglected from the late nineteenth century, these works underwent critical reassessment during the 1970s and 1980s, and all but three were either published for the first time or reprinted. Spence was hailed as the founder of a genre of realist fiction in Europe as well as Australia, and <span class="italic">Clara Morison</span> was described as &#145;the first colonial work that may fairly be compared with that of George Eliot or Elizabeth Gaskell&#146;  (Perkins, 146). Some, noting the critiques of gender-segmented labour markets in <span class="italic">Mr Hogarth's will</span> (1865), and of conventions governing marriage, most particularly in <span class="italic">Handfasted</span> (first published 1984)&#151;the judges of a competition to which Spence submitted this novel in 1880 rejected it on the grounds that &#145;it was calculated to loosen the marriage tie&#151;it was too socialistic, and consequently dangerous&#146;  (Spence, 63)&#151;have claimed for her a pioneering place in feminist writing.<br>
<br>Her religious doubts banished by her conversion to Unitarianism in the 1850s, Spence embarked on work with the Boarding-Out Society, established in 1872, which led to her appointment to the new state children's council in 1887, and to the government destitute board in 1897. At the invitation of the new state education department, she composed <span class="italic">The Laws we Live under</span> (1880), the first social studies textbook used in Australian schools. In 1878, after thirty years of publishing occasional press and journal articles under the pseudonym &#145;a Colonist of 1839&#146;, she was jubilant at being appointed &#145;a regular outside contributor&#146; to the daily <span class="italic">South Australian Register</span>: &#145;I felt as if the round woman had got at last into the round hole which fitted her&#146;  (Spence, 55). This provided her not only with &#145;a very decent income&#146; of around &pound;300 a year, but also with a broad and influential canvas for the causes she wished to promote  (Spence, 61). Principal among them was electoral reform, through the introduction of proportional representation, or, as she called it, &#145;effective voting&#146;  (ibid., 68). For this she took the skills in public speaking that she had developed as a preacher in the Unitarian church to public platforms throughout South Australia, in Melbourne, Sydney, and (in 1893&#150;4) across the United States and in London. In promoting this cause she stood for election to the Federal Convention of 1897, thus becoming Australia's first female political candidate.<br>
<br>A latecomer to the campaign for female suffrage in South Australia, in 1894 the first Australian colony to grant to women the right to vote and also to stand for election, Spence nevertheless provided active support to suffragists throughout Australia, in the United States, and in England, and to other feminist organizations around the turn of the century. In 1905, this short, stout, eighty-year-old announced: &#145;I am a new woman, and I know it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catherine Helen Spence</span>, 33). When she died, of heart failure, at her home in Queen Street, Norwood, Adelaide, on 3 April 1910 she was mourned as &#145;the Grand Old Woman of Australia&#146;  (Henry, 117). &#145;No more noteworthy woman ever lived in the Southern hemisphere&#146;, wrote the <span class="italic">Adelaide Register</span> (4 April 1910). She was buried on the following day at the Anglican cemetery, Glenelg. Spence is commemorated by a statue in Light Square, Adelaide, a scholarship, a section of a school, and an occasional-care centre.<br>
