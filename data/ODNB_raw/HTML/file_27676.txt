<span class="headword">Tredenham,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1668, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 28 March 1668 at St Ewe, Cornwall, the second (but first surviving) son of Sir Joseph Tredenham (1641/2&#150;1707), politician, of Tregonan, St Ewe, and Elizabeth Seymour (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;1731), daughter of Sir Edward Seymour, third baronet, of Berry Pomeroy, Devon. Little is known about Tredenham's early life, although he received a conventional education at the Inner Temple (1682) and Christ Church, Oxford (1684). At Oxford he was reputed to have contributed to the collection of verses celebrating the accession of James II.<br>
<br>Tredenham's tory contacts were formidable, not least his uncle, Sir Edward Seymour, fourth baronet. This may explain his early venture into the electoral arena, close to his twenty-first birthday, when he was defeated at Truro for a seat in the Convention Parliament of 1689. On 1 February 1690 he married Anne (<i>b</i>. 1671/2), daughter and coheir of Sir John Lloyd, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1651?&#150;1674), of Carmarthenshire, and Mary, daughter of the Revd Matthew Smallwood; they had one daughter, who predeceased her father. According to Sir Joseph, the marriage was not a success owing to the personality of Lady Lloyd who (among other things) intercepted letters between father and son. On 9 April 1690 Tredenham entered parliament in a by-election for St Mawes, following his uncle Henry Seymour's decision to sit elsewhere. Although a tory, Tredenham made little impact during his early years in the Commons, being overshadowed by his father. He did, however, refuse to sign the voluntary Association in 1696, although there is no evidence of his ever supporting the Jacobite cause.<br>
<br>Tredenham achieved considerable notoriety following a dinner on 23 September 1701 at the Blue Posts tavern in the Haymarket, London. His companions that night were his fellow tory MPs Anthony Hammond and Charles Davenant; the Spanish envoy, Navarra; and the French charg&eacute; d'affaires, Jean Baptiste Poussin. Unfortunately, orders had been issued to expel Poussin from England that day, in response to Louis XIV's recognition of James III (James Francis Edward Stuart). When this was discovered the whigs exploited it to the full, accusing the tories of Jacobitism, and at the subsequent general election appending the label &#145;Pousineer&#146; to those who had opposed preparations for war with France. A pamphlet war ensued, and both Davenant and Hammond lost their seats. Ironically Tredenham, who was widely blamed for the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle and who had reportedly left the tavern with Poussin, was re-elected for his family borough of St Mawes.<br>
<br>Tredenham continued to sit as a tory under Queen Anne, but there is evidence that he was trimming his sails in the pursuit of office. Both he and his father appear to have sneaked off to avoid voting on the tack of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> in November 1704. Lampooned as &#145;poet-laureat to Monsieur Poussin&#146; in 1705 he did not stand at the general election of that year, preferring to solicit Robert Harley for a diplomatic posting. In support of his pretensions he wrote &#145;I may with confidence pretend to understand the Latin tongue and that I'm no stranger to the French&#146;, although he laid most stress on his &#145;fidelity to her Majesty&#146;  (Tredenham to Harley, 13 July 1705, BL, Add. MS 70207). Despite reports in October that he would be posted to Denmark, no office was forthcoming, so he took the opportunity to return to the Commons after the death of his father in 1707. He continued to sit as a tory, and played a full part in the convocation of tinners in 1710, taking over the chair when the speaker fell ill. Tredenham died on 25 December 1710, either &#145;by a fall from his coach box&#146;  (Le Neve, 3.210) or, as one newsletter described it, &#145;suffocated with excessive fatness and too plentiful a dinner&#146;  (Strathmore MSS, box 74, bundle 10). In noticing his death, Abel Boyer pronounced him as &#145;one of the leading men of the Church party&#146; before referring to his enduring fame as a &#145;Pousineer&#146;  (Boyer, 53).<br>
