<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pepusch,  John Christopher</span>  (1666/7&#150;1752), <span class="occ">composer and teacher of music</span>, the son of a German protestant clergyman, was born at Berlin and baptized Johann Christoph Pepusch. Nothing more is known of his parents, nor is his date of birth certain, but according to the memorial tablet erected at the Charterhouse by his colleagues and pupils in 1767, he was eighty-five when he died. He studied theory under Martin Klingenberg, cantor of the Marienkirche in Berlin, and organ under Grosse, a Saxon otherwise unknown. At the age of fourteen Pepusch played the harpsichord at court and was soon afterwards appointed by Electress Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg to be the teacher of the electoral prince (later Frederick William I of Prussia). He moved to London by way of Holland, supposedly after witnessing &#145;a terrible act of despotism&#146;  (Burney, 2.985) by the elector, arriving shortly after the treaty of Ryswick in September 1697.<br>
<br>Pepusch's first documented appearance in England was in April 1704, when he provided compositions for an ensemble of visiting musicians headed by his brother Heinrich Gottfried Pepusch (<i>d</i>. 1750), an oboist employed by the Prussian court from 1692 to about 1736. He may already have been a member of the band at the Drury Lane Theatre and he certainly moved from there in early 1708 to join the opera company operating from the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. At the same time he took up residence in Hooker's (later Boswell) Court. For the next seven years he served the opera as violinist and harpsichordist, and prepared the pasticcio <span class="italic">Thomyris, Queen of Scythia</span> in April 1707, for which he composed the recitatives and added some additional songs.<br>
<br>Pepusch also served as the agent and accompanist for the soprano <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8828/', "(Francesca) Margherita (also Marguerite or Margaretta) de L'Epine (d. 1746)")</script> from about 1705, and as the organizer of public concerts at which many of his own works were performed. He was apparently already well known as a composer of instrumental works when he arrived in London, and he published a series of eight volumes in Amsterdam between 1705 and 1718, including five sets of violin sonatas, two of trio sonatas, and one each of recorder sonatas and concertos. A number of these works were also published in London, apparently without his permission. A number of concertos, solo and trio sonatas, and miscellaneous keyboard works remain in manuscript. The most interesting of these are seven sets of sonatas composed for various English violinists, each containing sixteen works in as many keys.<br>
<br>Pepusch was also active as a composer of vocal music. In 1710 he published <span class="italic">Six English Cantatas</span> to a set of texts by John Hughes. These, according to the poet, were written to demonstrate the desirability of setting English words to the newly imported Italian style of music. The most famous, <span class="italic">Alexis</span>, was sung well into the nineteenth century in a slightly adapted form with cello obbligato.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1713 Pepusch took his DMus degree from Oxford, matriculating from Magdalen College. The music to his academic ode in honour of Queen Anne, <span class="italic">Hail, Queen of Islands! Hail, Illustrious Fair</span>, does not survive, nor does that to his ode on the coronation of George I the following year.<br>
<br>In 1714 Pepusch transferred his allegiance to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, bringing with him singers and instrumentalists from the opera company at the Queen's Theatre. For this company he composed four masques with music in an Italianate style: <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> (1715), <span class="italic">Myrtillo and Laura</span> (1715), <span class="italic">Apollo and Daphne</span> (1716), and <span class="italic">The Death of Dido</span> (1716). These works were generally well received and seem to have influenced Handel in his composition of <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span>.<br>
<br>For the 1716&#150;17 season Pepusch joined John Rich's company at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, again bringing with him other performers. He remained until 1732 as director of the orchestra, while ceding most of the composing duties to John Ernest Galliard. Pepusch did continue to write cantatas, many of which were performed at public concerts or between the acts of plays. Some of these are included in his second book of <span class="italic">Six English Cantatas</span> published in 1720, and in other anthologies; perhaps a dozen more survive in manuscript or are lost. He also provided additional songs for a 1719 revival of <span class="italic">Thomyris, Queen of Scythia</span>.<br>
<br>Pepusch disappears from the London newspapers for the 1717&#150;18 season, presumably because of his involvement with the musical establishment of James Brydges, second earl of Carnarvon and later first duke of Chandos. He is recorded at Cannons, Chandos's estate near Edgware in Middlesex, as early as December 1717. He was again active at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre during the 1718&#150;19 season, but seems to have been appointed musical director at Cannons in early 1719 with a salary of &pound;25 per quarter. He held this position until mid-1723, after which he supplied musicians from London on an occasional basis.<br>
<br>At Cannons, Pepusch composed both sacred and secular music, in the earliest years as a colleague of Nicola Francesco Haym and George Frideric Handel, and was eventually responsible for an ensemble of some twenty-five singers and instrumentalists. The vast majority of Pepusch's fifteen known anthems, most for solo voices, chorus, and instruments, were written for services held in the parish church of St Lawrence, Little Stanmore, located adjacent to the estate. Pepusch also seems to have begun his career as a teacher of music about this time, and several of his students from Cannons, including Thomas Salway and Thomas Rawlings, became successful performers.<br>
<br>Some time during this period Pepusch married L'Epine, but the exact date has never been established. It may have been as early as 1718, when she first tentatively retired from the London stage, but it seems likely that Pepusch's appointment at Cannons in 1719 provided the financial security that permitted both their marriage and her official retirement from the stage after 28 May 1719. Their only child, a son, John, who died on 11 July 1739 after reputedly showing signs of considerable musical talent, was baptized at St Clement Danes on 9 January 1724. L'Epine remained active as a singing teacher, and Pepusch wrote cantatas during the 1720s for a number of her students.<br>
<br>Pepusch returned to Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre for the 1723&#150;4 season and provided a &#145;musical entertainment&#146; for St Cecilia's day 1723 entitled <span class="italic">The Union of the Three Sister Arts</span>, the songs from which were published. He also provided new music (now lost) for a revival of Thomas Betterton's and John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Prophetess, or, The History of Dioclesian</span> the following year but composed relatively little after this date.<br>
<br>Pepusch was almost certainly in charge of the music for John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, which opened on 29 January 1728. He composed the overture and may have had a hand in arranging the airs; that the musically inept basses in the printed edition are a reflection of his work seems unlikely. Gay's sequel, <span class="italic">Polly</span>, was published in 1729 but not performed on stage until 1777; again the extent of Pepusch's involvement is unknown. Both Burney and Hawkins say that at about this time Pepusch set out for North America in support of Bishop George Berkeley's project for a college there, but was shipwrecked. However, Berkeley sailed (to Rhode Island) without misadventure and Pepusch is not mentioned among his travelling companions. He seems to have retired after the 1732&#150;3 season when Rich decided to move the entire company to his Covent Garden Theatre, which was further away from Hooker's Court.<br>
<br>In 1726 Pepusch had been one of the founders of the Academy of Ancient Music, remaining its director until 1751, and from the 1730s it increasingly became a central focus of his activities. The singers were initially drawn from the choirs of St Paul's Cathedral and the Chapel Royal. In the early 1730s Maurice Greene left to establish a rival academy at the Apollo tavern, taking the St Paul's boys with him, and Bernard Gates also withdrew the Chapel Royal boys. After a year's struggle without trebles, it was arranged that Pepusch and at least one assistant would instruct boys in singing, accompanying on the harpsichord, and composition, as well as English grammar, writing, and arithmetic for a nominal fee. This may have been made easier by his move to a larger house in Fetter Lane in late 1734.<br>
<br>Pepusch also continued to teach privately, and his reputation grew. He was convinced of the perfection of Corelli's compositions, and published corrected and revised editions of the Italian composer's sonatas and concertos in score in 1732. According to Hawkins, Pepusch developed a &#145;musical code, consisting of rules extracted from the Works of his favourite Author, and the exercises which he enjoined his disciples were divisions on, and harmonies adapted to, basses selected from his works&#146;  (Hawkins, &#145;Life of Dr. Pepusch&#146;, 301). Among his pupils were William Boyce, James Nares, Samuel Howard, Benjamin Cooke, John Travers, William Babell, George Berg, William Savage, and John Christopher Smith jun.<br>
<br>In 1730 <span class="italic">A Treatise on Harmony: Containing the Chief Rules for Composing in Two, Three and Four Parts</span> was published anonymously. According to Hawkins, it was the work of Pepusch's student James Hamilton, Viscount Paisley and later seventh earl of Abercorn, and published without his permission. It probably illustrates elements of Pepusch's teaching, and the revised version which appeared the following year may have been done with Pepusch's assistance. Other reflections of Pepusch's teaching may be seen in the various &#145;Notes on harmony&#146; compiled by Benjamin Cooke between 1745 and 1751 (manuscripts in the British Library and the Royal College of Music), but <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Twelve Modes of Compositions and their Progressions in every Octave</span> in a manuscript of 1751 mentioned by W. H. Husk in the first edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music</span> cannot be traced.<br>
<br>In December 1737 Pepusch was appointed organist of the Charterhouse and moved to an apartment on the grounds. In the same year he offered William Oldys assistance in the preparation of a history of the art of music and its professors in England  (Oldys, 15). His increasing interest in the music of the ancients led to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1745 and the publication of his paper &#145;Of the various genera and species of music among the ancients&#146; in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> the following year.<br>
<br>His wife died on 8 August 1746 after which Pepusch increasingly retired from public life. He himself died in his rooms at the Charterhouse on 20 July 1752 and was buried three days later in the chapel there. According to his will, dated 9 July 1752 and proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 21 May 1753, his extensive library was to be divided between the Academy of Ancient Music, his colleague in the theatre Ephraim Kellner, and his student John Travers. Through a series of unfortunate circumstances it was scattered by the end of the eighteenth century and only a few pieces can now be identified. Pepusch's own compositions show great technical skill but little musical originality; they are well crafted but dull. His true legacy is to be found in the work of his students, both as composers and practical musicians and as collectors of the &#145;antient&#146; music he so loved.<br>
