<span class="headword">Tiptoft,  John</span>, first Baron Tiptoft  (<em>c.</em>1378&#150;1443), <span class="occ">administrator and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was son and heir of Sir Payn Tiptoft (<i>c</i>.1351&#150;<i>c</i>.1413) of Burwell, Cambridgeshire, and Agnes, sister of Sir John Wroth (<i>d</i>. 1407) of Enfield, Middlesex, whose estates he inherited in 1413. Sir Payn, as the youngest son of John, second Lord Tiptoft or Tibetot (1313&#150;1367), held substantial estates in Cambridgeshire. Although Sir Payn was a prominent retainer of Richard (III) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1397), his son joined the household of Henry, earl of Derby, serving in 1397 at a wage of 7&frac12;<i>d</i>. a day, and probably shared his exile during the next two years, for he was among those knighted on 11 October 1399, on the eve of Derby's coronation as Henry IV, and was formally retained for life with an annuity of 100 marks. By 1402 both he and his father were receiving livery as knights of the chamber. His prowess on campaign in Wales and the north won him considerable rewards, so that by 1406 his income from fees and annuities came to &pound;91 p.a. and land placed in his keeping provided &pound;34 p.a. more. He was elected for Huntingdonshire to the parliaments of January 1404, October 1404, and 1406, and in the last, notwithstanding his request for exoneration &#145;because of his youth and lack of sense and discretion&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.568), the Commons chose him as their speaker. Although he was the conduit of vociferous criticism of the administration, expressed in the three sessions of an unprecedentedly long parliament, which culminated in the nomination of the council in parliament and its subjection to articles drawn up by both houses, it is most unlikely that Tiptoft himself was opposed to the government (as historians have generally assumed). Rather, working for the crown, he first successfully contained a hostile house and then helped persuade it to accept a compromise package of reform. With considerable skill he offended neither his fellow MPs nor the king. On 8 December the council entrusted him with the proposed reform of the royal household by appointing him its treasurer. For eight months in 1407 he also held the office of chief butler, and he was removed from the treasurership of the household, in July 1408, only to be promoted to that of the exchequer. There he enjoyed considerable control over royal patronage, directly benefiting by further acquisitions of property for himself.<br>
<br>In 1406 or 1407, and before May 1407, Tiptoft made the first of two lucrative marriages. His first wife was Philippa (<i>c</i>.1367&#150;1417), sister and coheir of John Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1388) of Richards Castle, Herefordshire, and widow of Edward III's last chamberlain, Sir Robert Ashton (<i>d</i>. 1384), and of the distinguished soldier Sir Matthew Gournay (<i>d</i>. 1406). She brought him estates in ten shires, notably the Gournay holdings which he sold in reversion to Henry V for &pound;4000, enabling him to become a major landowner in the south and west, and particularly in Somerset. Tenure of the Gournay lordships in the Bordelais resulted in his appointment as seneschal of the Landes and constable of Dax, and in his involvement in the defence of that region. In 1408 he dispatched a ship to Bordeaux containing goods worth &pound;3000, but despite the truce it was taken by a vessel from Bilbao. Henry IV wrote to his nephew Juan II, king of Castile, to seek redress for him.<br>
<br>Dismissed from the treasurership in December 1409, during Prince Henry's ascendancy, Tiptoft remained in comparative obscurity for the next five years, and although he sat in parliament again in April 1414, for Somerset, he was not re-elected speaker. Henry V initially restricted his royal fees to &pound;120 a year, but he soon won the king's confidence, and in April 1415 was appointed seneschal of Aquitaine. His force of 480 soldiers was mustered at Plymouth on 19 June and disembarked at Bordeaux before 20 August. In 1416 he was empowered to treat for an extension of the truce between England and Castile, and following his return home he became closely involved in the diplomatic preparations for the invasion of Normandy, being the person most frequently entrusted with secret negotiations. In September he was attached to the retinue of Emperor Sigismund, with whom he travelled to Dordrecht and Luxembourg, discussing the ways Sigismund might support Henry V's campaign; and diplomatic work at the Council of Constance, lasting until May 1417, earned him a daily wage of &pound;2. On 25 January, Henry wrote instructing him to disclose secretly to Sigismund the duke of Bourbon's promise to recognize Henry as king of France. He again visited Constance in August. Having undertaken to provide a force of 120 men for service in Normandy, he joined the king there before November, and was appointed president of the duchy exchequer. In 1418 he received an entailed grant of a manor house in Caen for his residence. He occupied the presidency until January 1419, all the while continuing diplomatic work. Largely due to his initiative, Valois-inspired attacks on Gascony were suspended, but following renewed threats to the region he sailed there again in 1420, with a retinue 900 strong. He took Budos, and his viceregal authority was further enhanced by the royal grant of the lordship of Lesparre.<br>
<br>Before 8 July 1421 Tiptoft had contracted to marry again, and in February 1422 he secured Henry V's permission for the marriage to proceed because of his good services overseas. Joyce (<i>c</i>.1403&#150;1446), younger daughter and coheir of Edward, Baron Charlton of Powys (<i>d</i>. 1421), brought him not only considerable additions to his landed estate, but also social advancement, for her mother, Eleanor, was a daughter of Thomas Holland, fifth earl of Kent (<i>d</i>. 1397), and the widow of Roger Mortimer, fourth earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1398). Joyce was a coheir of her uncle Edmund, earl of Kent (<i>d</i>. 1408), and successive partitions of the Holland estates, notably in 1425 when her half-brother Edmund, earl of March, died, resulted in Tiptoft's further enrichment. He also added to his estates in Cambridgeshire, where his landed interests, centred on Burwell, had always been greatest. His annual income from land trebled, from &pound;360 in 1412 to &pound;1098 in 1436.<br>
<br>Henry V's death in 1422 led to Tiptoft's resignation of the seneschalcy of Aquitaine, and reinstated him in a position of authority at home. During the first parliament of Henry VI's reign he was appointed a member of the newly constituted council, with a salary of &pound;100 a year, and until 1432 he was conspicuous among the councillors for the regularity of his attendance at meetings. Well placed to enjoy the fruits of royal patronage, he secured the wardships and marriages of Sir Edmund Ingoldisthorpe (grandson and heir to both Sir John Ingoldisthorpe and Sir Walter de la Pole), to whom he married his daughter Joan, and of the heir of Thomas, Lord Ros of Helmsley, who married his eldest daughter, Philippa. A third daughter, Joyce, was matched with the eldest son of a fellow councillor, John, Lord Dudley. In 1425 his colleagues appointed him chief steward of the Welsh possessions late of the earl of March. Preferential treatment at the exchequer helped him recover large debts owing for past services. Numerous diplomatic assignments led to further travels abroad, and he visited France in December 1424 for talks with the regent, John, duke of Bedford (<i>d</i>. 1435). His summons (as Lord Tiptoft) to the parliament at Leicester in February 1426, and his appointment shortly afterwards as steward of the household, indicate that he supported Bedford's policies. From May to July 1427 he was absent on an embassy to the dukes of Bedford and Burgundy, and in 1430 he accompanied the king to France for his coronation. During the next two years he made several journeys home on governmental business, on one such spending Christmas with Cardinal Henry Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1447) at Canterbury. At the parliament of 1431 he successfully presented petitions regarding his wife's inheritance and the sale of the Gournay estates. Following the coronation in Paris on 16 December he returned home with the king in February 1432, only to be displaced from the stewardship of the household in a coup staged by Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447). His appearances at council meetings became sporadic, although he was among the councillors who in November 1434 protested to the king about his susceptibility to the advice of others.<br>
<br>Probably because of the threat to Marck Castle, of which he had been made governor five years earlier, in June 1436 Tiptoft led a troop of eighty-five men on Gloucester's expedition to relieve Calais. His negotiations with delegates from the Hanseatic League later that year resulted in a commercial treaty. Following Henry VI's formal assumption of control over the government in 1437 he joined the &#145;prive counseill&#146;, and although his salary was reduced to 100 marks this was guaranteed for life, even if he was absent through ill health. Further diplomatic assignments attest that his faculties remained unimpaired for some years more. Yet in Cambridgeshire, where he had long been dominant, his rule was successfully challenged at the elections to the parliament of 1439 by Sir James Butler (<i>d</i>. 1461), the heir to the earldom of Ormond, who asserted that Tiptoft had done countless wrongs to the local people.<br>
<br>Tiptoft's last recorded attendances on the council fell in August 1442, and he died about the end of January 1443, having left instructions for the foundation of a chantry in Ely Cathedral, his likely burial place. He apparently composed the commonplace book of English history known as Tiptoft's chronicle, showing scholarly interests that he evidently transmitted to his son, the humanist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27471/', "John Tiptoft (1427&#150;1470)")</script>, who was created earl of Worcester in 1449.<br>
