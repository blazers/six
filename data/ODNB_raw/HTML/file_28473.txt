<span class="headword">Walker,  Clement</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Theodorus Verax]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">political pamphleteer</span>, was born at Cliffe, in the parish of Tincleton, Dorset. His father was Thomas Walker of Westminster. Clement may have attended Christ Church, Oxford, though there is no record of his matriculation. In 1611 he was admitted to Middle Temple. Soon afterwards he inherited the office of usher of receipt in the exchequer, but he always employed a deputy to do the work. In the 1630s he was also marshal of common pleas.<br>
<br>Some time before 1626 Walker married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1631), daughter of Sir William Pitt, a teller of the exchequer. They had three children, born between 1626 and 1631, but it was not a happy marriage. There were rumours that Frances had been unfaithful, and in June 1629 Walker stabbed and seriously wounded her; the whalebones of her stomacher saved her life. Her father wanted to hush it up, but his son told him that this was impossible, because &#145;the whole Sheir of Dorsett doth ring with the Infamous fame therof&#146;  (BL, Add MS 29974, fol. 118). Frances eventually recovered, and the couple were at least partly reconciled before her death in 1631, although her husband still remained on bad terms with her family. In 1634 Walker was married a second time, to Mary, daughter of Sir William Button. She claimed to have brought him a large marriage portion; in return he settled his office on her as jointure. A son, John, was born to this marriage. The attempt on Frances's life blotted Walker's reputation: Anthony Wood later said that his hands were &#145;stained with his own wife's blood&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.293).<br>
<br>By 1640 Walker had acquired an estate at Charterhouse-on-Mendip, Somerset. He supported parliament in the civil war and early in 1643 was appointed to the Somerset assessment and sequestration committees. Soon afterwards he served as advocate in the trial of Robert Yeomans and George Bourchier for attempting to betray Bristol to Prince Rupert. Walker remained in Bristol, and was there when the city fell to Rupert at the end of July 1643. The governor, Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes, defended himself from charges that he had not put up a resolute defence, provoking Walker to accuse him of cowardice. On 25 September 1643 Walker was sent for by the House of Lords, charged with having scandalized Fiennes's father, Lord Saye and Sele. When taken into custody Walker said that Saye was &#145;a base beggarly Lord, and that his Sons were Cowards&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 6.240&#150;41). The Lords fined him &pound;100, awarded Saye &pound;500 damages, and required Walker to make submission at the bar of the house. He refused to submit, claiming that the Lords' judgment &#145;was against the Liberty of the Subject&#146;, and that they had no right to try &#145;a Commoner of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 6.247). He was sent to the Tower, but released on bail on 17 October so that he and William Prynne could prosecute the charges against Fiennes. The colonel was court-martialled and sentenced to death, though subsequently pardoned by his commander, the earl of Essex.<br>
<br>After his release Walker may have spent several years in London; there is no sign that he ever attended meetings of the Somerset committee. He claimed to have lost his whole estate during the war (&pound;10,000 according to his later estimate), to have spent another &pound;3000 in the parliament's service, and to be liable for &pound;5000 borrowed for the defence of Bristol. These sums are almost certainly exaggerations. In 1646 he was elected to the House of Commons for Wells; according to Wood, he curried favour with the local puritans in order to win the seat. He took the covenant on 24 June. In the same year he was named an elder of the Somerset presbyterian classis, though he was critical of clergy who wished to impose an oppressive discipline on the Scottish model. He was one of those accused of instigating the &#145;presbyterian&#146; London riots of 26 July 1647. He stayed at Westminster when the speakers fled to the army at the end of that month, and on 1 August he was named as chairman of a committee charged with drawing up a protest against the army's actions; his notes for this declaration were soon confiscated.<br>
<br>By this time Walker was writing the first of his numerous pamphlets against the parliamentary radicals. <span class="italic">The Mystery of the Two Juntoes</span> was written in 1647 under the pseudonym Theodorus Verax; in 1648 it was incorporated, along with the first volume of Walker's <span class="italic">History of Independency</span>, in his <span class="italic">Relations and Observations, Historical and Politick, upon the Parliament Begun anno Dom. 1640</span>. Walker argued that the increasing polarization of parliament between &#145;Presbyterians&#146; and &#145;Independents&#146; was a sham to enable the leaders of the factions to divide offices and patronage between them. He claimed to express the views of the non-partisan back-benchers, &#145;the honest middle men of the House&#146;  (C. Walker, <span class="italic">Mystery</span>, 1647, 6). Their desire for a moderate settlement, he said, had been betrayed by their leaders: &#145;the controversie between the 2 <i>Juntoes</i> being no more than whose slaves we shall be&#146;  (ibid., 17). Despite his later reputation as a presbyterian, Walker was even-handed in his criticisms of the two factions, blaming the presbyterians for needlessly antagonizing Fairfax's army, and for trying to constitute a countervailing force against the New Model out of disbanded supernumerary forces.<br>
<br>However, by May 1648 Walker was convinced that it was the radical Independents who were responsible for the illegalities being perpetrated by parliament. In part one of <span class="italic">The History of Independency</span> he argued that the army and its allies in the Commons were obstructing a settlement with the king, aiming at achieving power for themselves. His case against the Independents was further developed in <span class="italic">Anarchie Anglicana, or, The History of Independency, the Second Part</span> (1649), which focused largely on the events of the previous year. A third part of the series, entitled <span class="italic">The High Court of Justice, or, Cromwells New Slaughter House in England</span>, appeared in 1651.<br>
<br>There are few signs of Walker's parliamentary activities in 1648. On 17 June he joined the presbyterians in demanding an investigation of an alleged plot to poison Charles I, and he was sometimes involved in Somerset affairs, joining with other MPs in October to ask for the disbandment of military forces in the county. On 2 December he was named to the presbyterian militia commission for Somerset. In the great all-night debate in the Commons on 4&#150;5 December, Walker spoke in favour of accepting the king's recent answers in the treaty of Newport. He also supported the subsequent motion that the king's answers were a satisfactory basis for continuing negotiations. He was imprisoned in Pride's Purge on 6 December, and remained in custody until some time in January 1649. During that month he joined William Prynne in publishing <span class="italic">A Declaration and Protestation</span> against the army's recent actions.<br>
<br>Walker was again arrested soon after the publication of the second part of <span class="italic">The History of Independency</span>. On 24 October 1649 his papers were seized by order of the House of Commons; soon afterwards he was committed to the Tower on a charge of treason, though he was never brought to trial. During his imprisonment the committee of revenue took away his exchequer office and conferred it upon another MP, Humphrey Edwards, whom Walker publicly denounced in a broadside entitled <span class="italic">The Case between Clement Walker Esq. and Humphrey Edwards, Truely Stated</span> (1650); his wife wrote a similar attack. Walker died in the Tower in October 1651, and was buried at the nearby church of All Hallows Barking. No known portrait has survived, but a 1647 deposition described Walker as being of short stature, and in 1650 George Wither spoke sneeringly of his red nose and wrinkled face.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood said that Walker was &#145;notably vers'd in the liberties and privileges of parliament, and in the statute law of the kingdom&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.293), but he is chiefly important as a political pamphleteer. <span class="italic">The History of Independency</span> was a highly effective piece of propaganda against the radicals in parliament, the army, and the counties, especially Somerset. It was still in demand after the Restoration, and was reprinted in 1661. Walker may have begun a continuation, but the one that appeared in 1661 was written by a certain &#145;T. M&#146;.<br>
