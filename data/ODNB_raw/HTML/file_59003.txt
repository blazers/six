<span class="headword">Tourtel <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Caldwell]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1874&#150;1948), <span class="occ">illustrator and author</span>, was born on 28 January 1874 at 52 Palace Street, Canterbury, Kent, the youngest child of Samuel Austen Caldwell, a stained-glass designer and stonemason, and his wife, Sarah, formerly Scott. Mary's father, and later his son Samuel, restored stained glass for Canterbury Cathedral. Her elder brother Edmund was a talented animal painter and book illustrator who exhibited at the Royal Academy. In this artistic environment, it is not surprising that Mary showed an early talent for drawing, and she was educated at the prestigious local Sidney Cooper School of Art, where she won the coveted Prince of Wales scholarship. Her forte was animal drawing, and her illustrations for children's books were first published in 1897. A handsome, strong-featured woman, she married, at Stoke Poges on 26 September 1900, the journalist Herbert Bird Tourtel (1874&#150;1931), son of Peter Tourtel, journalist, of St Peter Port, Guernsey.<br>
<br>Mary and Herbert Tourtel remained childless, and travelled extensively together in Italy, Egypt, and India. Later they were to develop a shared passion for flying, and Mary Tourtel was then able to sketch from the air unusual angles and aspects of landscape which were to enrich many of her picture-strips.<br>
<br>It is as the creator of Rupert Bear that she attained distinction. Despite her talents and successful early career, Mary Tourtel's anthropomorphic animal drawings had considerably less panache than those of several gifted contemporaries (notably the Teddy Tail originator, Charles Folkard, and H. S. Foxwell, the most brilliant of the Amalgamated Press's Tiger Tim illustrators). Nevertheless she created Britain's longest-running newspaper-strip hero. Now frequently dubbed &#145;Britain's answer to Mickey Mouse&#146;, Rupert owed his existence to the Fleet Street circulation battles. The <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> launched Folkard's sale-boosting mouse, Teddy Tail, in 1915 and the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> followed suit with A. B. Payne's extremely successful penguin and dog twosome, Pip and Squeak, who were soon joined by Wilfred, their rabbit foster child. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>'s proprietor Lord Beaverbrook instructed his editor, R. D. Blumenfeld, to find and develop an animal character to eclipse those of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. One or two experimental strips were tried and rejected, and Herbert Tourtel, then a sub-editor on the paper, suggested that Mary could produce what was required.<br>
<br>Mary Tourtel's first Rupert serial, <span class="italic">The Little Lost Bear</span>, began as a single-frame picture with verse narrative on 8 November 1920: Rupert's neat appearance (his scarf, sweater, checked trousers, and upright stance) was immediately established. He was pictured with his parents, and thus tenuously linked with magical elements of <span class="italic">The Three Bears</span> fairy-tale, but a cosy, domestic atmosphere was also conveyed. All this, plus the fact that Rupert, despite his furry head and hands, was always in essence a small boy (in fact a juvenile version of Everyman) ensured his success. Adult readers as well as children empathized with his wonderfully wide-ranging adventures in which he was frequently the innocent abroad, beset by but always triumphing over evil in the shape of Tourtel's colourful ogres, giants, and monsters. Her balladic style and rustic but Gothic-spiced settings launched not only Rupert but his assorted animal chums, and arguably her most intriguing character, the Merlin-esque Wise Old Goat.<br>
<br>Mary Tourtel drew, and contributed most of the slightly lumpy verse to, the daily Rupert strip until 1935, giving it up then because of failing eyesight. Her husband had died from a heart condition in 1931, and on her retirement Mary returned to Canterbury. She developed a brain tumour, and died in Kent and Canterbury Hospital on 15 March 1948; she was buried in St Martin's churchyard, Canterbury.<br>
<br>In the hands of subsequent artists Rupert has continued in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, in books, and on television, giving rise to a whole line of merchandise. There has been some slight updating in deference to new social attitudes, and, despite occasional accusations of anti-feminism, racism, and class prejudice, Rupert has survived, holding an appeal for a varied readership.<br>
