<span class="headword">Walkden,  Peter</span>  (1684&#150;1769), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and diarist</span>, was born at Flixton, near Manchester, on 16 October 1684. Nothing is known of his parents. He was educated at a village school, then from 1706 at the academy of James Coningham, minister of the Presbyterian chapel at Manchester. From 1 May 1709 he served as pastor at Garsdale, Yorkshire. At the end of 1711 he became minister of two congregations at Newton in Bowland, Yorkshire, and Hesketh Lane, near Chipping, in a poor and sparsely inhabited part of rural Lancashire. He remained there until 1738, when he moved to Holcombe, near Bury, in the same county. In 1744 he was appointed to the pastorate of the Old Tabernacle, Stockport, Cheshire.<br>
<br>Walkden's diary for the years 1725, 1729, and 1730 presents a vivid picture of the hard life of a poor country minister. Passages from his correspondence and commonplace books have been printed, as well as most of the extant part of his diary.<br>
<br>Walkden was twice married: his first wife died in December 1715. One of his wives was named Margaret Woodworth, and he had eight children. Walkden died at Stockport on 5 November 1769, and is buried in his chapel there. One of his four sons, Henry, followed him in the Presbyterian ministry and wrote a Latin epitaph for his tomb. Henry is said to have been educated in London, but after a promising start, &#145;some immoral conduct occasioned his dismissal&#146; from a congregation at Tintwistle, Cheshire  (Nightingale, 1.228). He died at Clitheroe, Lancashire, in 1795. Peter Walkden's daughter Catherine married William Fogg, and was the mother of the Revd Peter Walkden Fogg of Ormskirk, Lancashire, and grandmother of Henry Fogg, also minister there for sixty-four years.<br>
