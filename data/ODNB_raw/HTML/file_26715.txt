<span class="headword">Stuart,  John</span>  (1718&#150;1779), <span class="occ">colonial official and merchant</span>, was born in Inverness on 25 September 1718, the son of John Stuart, merchant and magistrate of Inverness, and his second wife, Christian MacLeod. After an initial education in the Inverness grammar school, Stuart left at the age of seventeen for London to work in a merchant house, moving between London and San Lucar de Barrameda, Andalusia. When war between Britain and Spain erupted, he joined Commodore George Anson's expedition, which set sail in 1740 to harass Spanish shipping in the Americas. During his brief naval career he served as a clerk and as a ship's purser and rose to the rank of midshipman.<br>
<br>In 1748 Stuart moved to South Carolina, like many Scots at the time, and established himself in Charles Town as a business partner of Patrick Reid, a fellow Scot whom Stuart had met in England in 1746. Soon after his arrival he married Sarah, with whom he had three daughters and one son. The business did not fare well, and when Reid died in April 1754 he left Stuart with heavy debts, which forced him into bankruptcy and near destitution within a year. During this time and the years that followed&#151;during which Stuart repaid his creditors&#151;he established himself in Charles Town society, serving in a number of public offices including St Philip's parish firemaster (1752) and assemblyman for St Helena parish (1754&#150;6), and joined social organizations such as the Charles Town Library Society and the Charles Town grand lodge of free and accepted masons.<br>
<br>When the French and Indian war erupted, Stuart was commissioned a captain in the South Carolina provincial militia. His first task was to recruit a company to assist in the construction of Fort Loudoun in the neighbouring Overhill Cherokee country (subsequently Tennessee), which was intended to offer protection to Britain's American Indian allies while their warriors were away campaigning. At the fort Stuart built upon the good relations he had developed with the Cherokee as a trader, and ultimately took charge of arranging for the local women to provide provisions for the fort's garrison. Cherokee&#150;British relations rapidly deteriorated after the fort's completion as young warriors on their return from campaigning took to plundering backcountry colonial farms, and white frontiersmen took Cherokee scalps and attempted to pass them as enemy Creek scalps in order to claim the hefty bounties being offered by the colonial governments. In 1759 full-scale war erupted, and in early 1760 Stuart and his company were sent to bolster Fort Loudoun's garrison. Although the British claimed victory, the war was inconclusive. Each summer a combination of British regulars, allied American Indians, and colonial militia would invade the Cherokee territory and destroy as many crops and towns as possible; meanwhile the Cherokee would avoid the advancing troops and instead raid the frontier and cut off supplies to existing forts. At Fort Loudoun the garrison was besieged for nine months in 1760 before starvation forced surrender. The troops were promised safe passage but were massacred within a few miles of the fort. Stuart was one of the few survivors, and owed his life to Attakullakulla (Little Carpenter), a prominent, tea-drinking Cherokee leader who had visited Britain and was a long-standing supporter of a British&#150;Cherokee friendship.<br>
<br>Following his safe return to Charles Town, Stuart's prominence in handling American Indian relations grew. With the backing of South Carolina governor Thomas Boone and Attakullakulla, Stuart was chosen to replace the generally inactive, and shortly afterwards deceased, Edmund Atkin as the British Indian superintendent for Indian affairs for the southern district. Created in 1756, the two superintendents were part of the British programme to assert a centralized diplomatic and military authority in order to achieve victory in North America. The superintendents and their staffs answered directly to the British commander-in-chief in America and to the secretaries of state, thus bypassing any colonial authorities. After defeating the French and their American Indian allies, the superintendencies, like many elements of the British military establishment, remained in peacetime North America. During the French and Indian wars the British government had been shocked at how well the American Indians fought, disappointed that so many sided with France over Britain, and frustrated with how ineffective the bickering colonial governments had been in remedying the situation. Stuart and his northern counterpart, Sir William Johnson, were charged with the task of maintaining a peaceful frontier and ensuring American Indian grievances were addressed before a war broke out that would disrupt the all-important recovering economies of colonial America.<br>
<br>The primary American Indian grievances were the invasion of their lands by white settlers and the abuses of white traders who took advantage of American Indian dependence on a number of European goods, particularly firearms and gunpowder. The complaint about encroachment was addressed initially by the royal proclamation of 1763, which was intended to guide expansion away from major American Indian nations in the interior. Stuart's task was to enforce the proclamation by mediating border treaties between the colonial governments and the American Indians and by evicting illegal settlers. The British answer to trade grievances was regulation. Traders were expected to be licensed, and trade was to be conducted only at specified locations where, in theory, the superintendents or a member of their staffs could monitor activities. Stuart went to work immediately, organizing a massive congress in Augusta, Georgia, in November 1763 at which the southern colonial governors met with delegations from the various neighbouring American Indian nations. This was the first of a series of congresses that ultimately led to one of the most peaceful decades on the colonial American frontier and the establishment of a western border. Stuart's favoured tools in these negotiations were gifts. More than mere bribes, abundant gifts bestowed on favourably disposed leaders ensured that these men, who would in turn spread the wealth to their own supporters within their communities, would rise to power. At the Augusta conference alone, Stuart distributed gifts that included 1077 guns, 2300 shirts, 500 brass pans, 576 hatchets, 79 looking glasses, 36,500 gun flints, 190 saddles, 798 bridles, and an abundance of gunpowder  (TNA: PRO, CO 5/65, part 2, fol. 74). He sent the bill to the secretary of state.<br>
<br>Although initially willing to pay handsomely for results, the British government became increasingly apprehensive of such administrative costs in America as its post-war efforts to compel the colonists to share in some of the costs met alarming resistance. By 1768 the superintendents' budgets had been drastically slashed, forcing Stuart to release much of his staff and cease lavish gift-giving. By this point the British government had abandoned any hopes of an imperially regulated American Indian trade. Enforcing the borders was an equally lost cause, as frontier garrisons were redeployed to the riotous colonial cities. By the early 1770s the British had effectively given up, and Stuart was placed on a shoestring budget.<br>
<br>When the American War of Independence broke out in 1775, the British reaped the rewards of Stuart's work. The vast majority of American Indian leaders in his district either sided with the British or declared their neutrality. Stuart received unprecedented financial resources to secure continued Indian support, but the tide of American patriotism proved too strong. Hampered by British war leaders who were unfamiliar with Indian affairs, an increasingly desperate British government, and American Indian leaders who were wary of remaining allied to a collapsing British authority, Stuart was forced out of the Carolinas and then Georgia. As the interior order he helped to construct collapsed around him, he took refuge in the loyalist-dominated Floridas, dying in Pensacola on 21 March 1779.<br>
