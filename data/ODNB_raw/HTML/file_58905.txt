<span class="headword">Williams,  Waldo Goronwy</span>  (1904&#150;1971), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 30 September 1904 at the Board School House, Prendergast, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, one of the five children of John Edwal Williams (1863&#150;1934), schoolmaster, and his wife, Angharad Elizabeth (1875&#150;1932), daughter of John Jones of Llangernyw in Flintshire, a brother of Sir Henry Jones, professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow University. His mother, although of Welsh stock, had been born and brought up at Market Drayton in Shropshire, and English, her first language, was also the language of their home. Both parents were staunch Baptists, pacifists, and members of the Independent Labour Party; among Edwal Williams's heroes were Shelley, Tolstoy, Whitman, and Keir Hardie.<br>
<br>In 1911 the family moved to Mynachlog-ddu in the Preseli hills, and five years later to Llandysilio, where the father had been appointed headmaster of the primary school. This move north of the landsker (the line dividing the English-speaking south of Pembrokeshire from the Welsh-speaking north) was to prove decisive in the making of the poet: Williams learned Welsh from his playmates in the village and it was the language in which all his creative writing would be done. From the Preseli communities, economically marginal but with a rich culture, he also acquired the sense of neighbourhood, social co-operation, compassion for the underprivileged, and independence of judgement which were to remain with him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Waldo (some of the great poets of Wales are known by their first names) received his secondary education at the grammar school in Narberth, and in 1923 went to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he was to read English and where, in the company of Idwal Jones, he began writing light verse, especially limericks and parodies, some of which are memorable; he also immersed himself in the work of the English Romantic poets during his time at Aberystwyth. For the next thirteen years he lived a peripatetic life, working as a &#145;permanent supply&#146; teacher at primary schools in the north and south of his native county.<br>
<br>On 14 April 1941 Waldo married Linda Llewellyn (1911&#150;1943), a primary school teacher, and they made their home at Cas-mael (Puncheston), where he was acting headmaster. In the year following, having registered as a conscientious objector despite being too old for military service, he appeared before a tribunal at Carmarthen, to which he made a statement beginning,<blockquote>I believe all men to be brothers, and to be humble partakers of the Divine Imagination that brought forth the world, and that now enables us to be born again into its own richness, by doing unto others as we would others to do unto us.</blockquote>He was released from military service unconditionally. Shortly afterwards, under pressure from an education authority which disapproved of his stand against war, he left Pembrokeshire to take up a post at the grammar school in Botwnnog in Caernarvonshire. There, in May 1943, when she was only thirty-two, tragedy struck: after a brief illness his wife, Linda, died.<br>
<br>The Second World War weighed heavily on Waldo's mind. The loss of life on both sides of the conflict caused him profound and permanent grief, challenging his belief in the essential goodness and brotherhood of all men, while nearer to home the War Office was ravaging the Pembrokeshire countryside by building aerodromes and artillery ranges. In 1945, partly in an attempt to recover from the shock of his wife's death, he left Wales to take up teaching posts in Huntingdon and Wiltshire, but returned to Pembrokeshire five years later. He was employed as a tutor by the extra-mural department of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, from 1951 to 1963, and thereafter taught Welsh as a second language at primary schools in Pembrokeshire; he had a special rapport with children, who responded readily to his genial personality and eirenic ways. He joined the Quakers in 1953.<br>
<br>The explosion of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused Waldo to write some of his most anguished poetry. While living in England he also wrote a number of poems about Welsh nationhood, such as &#145;Preseli&#146;, &#145;Cymru'n un&#146;, and &#145;Cymru a Chymraeg&#146;, which are among the most powerful expressions of cultural nationalism in the language; they have often been quoted, especially when young members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh language society) have been tried for acts of non-violent resistance to the authority of the British state. The poet was deeply suspicious of the state and the technocratic instruments of its power over the individual, as can be seen from &#145;Brenhiniaeth a brawdoliaeth&#146; (&#145;Sovereignty and brotherhood&#146;), a lecture showing the influence of Berdyaev and published in 1956. Although by no means a politician by nature, he was a zealous member of Plaid Cymru and, persuaded by his friend the veteran nationalist D. J. Williams, stood as the party's candidate in Pembrokeshire at the general election of 1959, polling 2250 votes.<br>
<br>During the late 1950s Waldo announced, as a protest against the war in Korea, that he would refuse to pay his income tax, and on this account (he owed &pound;15 4<i>s</i>.) he served two six-week prison sentences in 1960 and 1961; some of his property was distrained and he chose to be declared bankrupt in order to avoid further tax demands. Only when he had made his point would he allow his poems to be brought together in book form; he had always been careless with his manuscripts and the book was at proof stage, compiled by friends, before he knew of the plan to publish it. Apart from a small collection of delightful poems for children, <span class="italic">Cerddi'r plant</span> (1956), written in collaboration with his friend E. Llwyd Williams, <span class="italic">Dail pren</span>, which appeared in the same year, was the only book of his to be published during his lifetime. A larger, fine edition also containing later work was brought out by Gwasg Gregynog in 1992, and a selection of his poems in English translation by Tony Conran appeared under the title <span class="italic">The Peacemakers</span> in 1997.<br>
<br>The sixty-seven poems in <span class="italic">Dail pren</span> display an astonishing range of styles and subject matter. In &#145;Mewn dau gae&#146;, perhaps Waldo's greatest poem, he describes the apocalyptic moment when, in a neighbour's fields, he realized that all men and women are, above all else, brothers and sisters; the poem ends with a vision of &#145;the exiled king&#146; who comes to reclaim his kingdom, the rushes parting where he treads. Other poems, such as &#145;Cofio&#146; and &#145;Geneth ifanc&#146;, the latter about a girl whose skeleton, dating from about 2500 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, he had seen in the museum at Avebury, but influenced by the death of his thirteen-year-old sister Morfudd in 1915, employ traditional forms that have helped to make them popular as recitation pieces. His patriotic verse, rooted in his robust sense of community, is linked to universal themes that rely not on abstraction but on a real love of humankind.<br>
<br>Waldo died at St Thomas's Hospital in Haverfordwest on ascension day, 20 May 1971, and was buried four days later with his parents and wife in the graveyard of the Baptist chapel at Blaenconin near Mynachlog-ddu, where his grave bears the inscription &#145;Gwyn eu byd y tangnefeddwyr&#146; (&#145;Blessed are the peacemakers&#146;). Waldo, the best-loved Welsh poet of the twentieth century, is commemorated by a rough-hewn stone which was erected at Rhos-fach, just outside the village, in 1978.<br>
