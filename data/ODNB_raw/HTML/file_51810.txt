<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Crawley,  Aidan Merivale</span>  (1908&#150;1993), <span class="occ">politician and television executive</span>, was born on 10 April 1908 at the vicarage, Benenden, near Cranbrook, Kent, the third of the five children of Arthur Stafford Crawley, vicar of Benenden (later canon of Windsor), and his wife, Anstice Katharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs. His paternal grandfather was an entrepreneur, specializing in overseas railways; his mother's roots lay in west-country farming. Both families had a tradition of service in the Church of England. As a result his childhood was dominated by clergymen, especially Archbishop Cosmo Lang, of York, whom his father later served as chaplain and after whom his elder brother was named.<br>
<br>Crawley began his education in London in the summer of 1917 in preparation for enrolment at Farnborough School, a boarding preparatory school, in September 1917. He entered Harrow School in 1920, completing his education there in the summer of 1926. At Harrow he shone academically&#151;winning the top history scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford, on his departure&#151;but above all on the cricket field. Tall, rugged, with a jutting chin and sharply-defined face, he was the stereotypical gifted schoolboy, an inter-war hero. In the Harrow XIs of 1924, 1925, and 1926 he missed out on the captaincy only because of his youth. The headmaster's son became captain in his stead. As an undergraduate studying history at Trinity College, Oxford (1926&#150;30), he again shone, especially as a batsman, scoring 1137 runs in 1928 (including five centuries) against first-class opposition. He was also a leading member of Oxford's Bullingdon Club, becoming friends with Frank Pakenham (later Lord Longford). In later life he recalled that Evelyn Waugh's <span class="italic">Brideshead Revisited</span> reflected much that he remembered about his time at university. In 1929 his college extended his scholarship and he graduated in 1930 with a second class degree. That summer his name was listed in an England XII against South Africa, but he was not chosen to play. He had some success as an amateur for Kent but left full-time cricket at the end of the year, though it remained his chief recreation. He was a co-founder of the national village cricket championship in 1971, and president of the MCC in 1973.<br>
<br>In October 1930 Crawley began work as a cub reporter at the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, entering the Commons lobby in 1931 or 1932. In the latter year he began a series of jobs at regional papers in the Harmsworth group, visiting the United States in 1933 to report on the &#145;new deal&#146;. This was a sign of his growing tilt towards socialism, encouraged by his work in recession-hit south Wales. In 1936 he left the Harmsworth group, unable to stomach its fascist sympathies. He then began an involvement in factual film-making that lasted for the rest of his life. Early in 1937 he left for Palestine, to make films about life there; these were shown with limited success in 1938. On his return he joined the Auxiliary Air Force, though he cautioned against active British involvement in the Spanish Civil War, then a cause for many on the left, including his future wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51487/', "(Harriet) Virginia Spencer Cowles")</script>, a foreign correspondent and gifted writer whom he met in 1937. He joined the Labour Party late the same year. He wrote to Hugh Dalton and found himself in agreement with the latter's campaign for rearmament. Dalton helped him achieve selection as Labour candidate for the then Conservative seat of North Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out Crawley was serving as an auxiliary with 601 squadron. In February 1940 he joined the Balkan intelligence service, based in Istanbul, with the aim of keeping Turkey neutral. Late in that year he moved to Sofia, fleeing in March 1941 as Germany attacked Bulgaria. As a result he returned to air force service, flying Hurricanes with 73 fighter squadron in the western desert, before being shot down and captured by a German truck convoy, flown to Greece, and held at a prisoner-of-war camp in Salonika. Anxious to hide his work in the Balkans, he registered with a false forename&#151;Stafford&#151;when formally taken prisoner and sent to Germany. He was held at a succession of camps, ending at Schubin in Poland. There he took part in an attempt to escape by tunnelling under the perimeter: on 5 March 1943 he broke out and, using false documents, headed for Switzerland. After a remarkable journey across the Reich he was recaptured by the Gestapo on the Swiss border. After interrogation he was returned to Schubin. He played a peripheral part in another escape, later described by Eric Williams in his book <span class="italic">The Wooden Horse</span> (1949) and by Crawley in his <span class="italic">Escape from Germany</span> (1956). In May 1945 the camp was liberated and he returned to England.<br>
<br>On his return Crawley was almost immediately thrown into campaigning as Labour candidate for North Buckinghamshire. Unexpectedly he won with a majority of 3845&#151;part of the Labour landslide of July 1945. He also resumed his relationship with Virginia Cowles. They were married by his father on 30 July 1945 at St George's, Hanover Square. She was the daughter of Edward Spencer Cowles, a physician. They had three children, Andrew, Reginald, and Harriet. Like his fellow new MPs Woodrow Wyatt and Christopher Mayhew, Crawley represented the technocratic face of the Labour Party, ensuring that it could claim to represent progressives of all classes. Looking back in his memoirs he recalled the spirit of the time: &#145;we were not only going to build a new world, but we could see no reason why we should not be in power for the next thirty years&#146;  (Crawley, 209). A gilded high flyer, he served as parliamentary private secretary to two colonial secretaries, George Hall and Arthur Creech-Jones. In February 1950 he was re-elected at the general election, with a reduced majority of 1500, and appointed under-secretary at the Air Ministry. He toured RAF bases in Asia before returning to fight the October 1951 general election, losing his seat by fifty-four votes.<br>
<br>Crawley's response was to return to film-making. With three other former Labour ministers (Mayhew, Wyatt, and John Freeman) he became a star documentary maker with the BBC, travelling to India to make a series shown in 1953. His face became synonymous with the new medium, especially as a presenter on <span class="italic">Viewfinder</span> in 1954. In this he was ahead of his political generation. In February 1955 he was named editor-in-chief of Independent Television News (ITN), due to come on air in September. In this role he insisted&#151;to the point of threatened resignation&#151;on freedom in selecting presenters, choosing Robin Day, Christopher Chataway, and Reginald Bosanquet, all to become famous. Day described his appointment in his memoir, <span class="italic">Grand Inquisitor</span> (1989), making much of the makeshift facilities available to ITN and Crawley's inspiring role. The channel was launched successfully but ITN's budget and air time immediately came under fire. Crawley threatened to resign unless ITN retained at least 20 minutes of broadcasts a day. Air time was safeguarded but after failing to overturn budget cuts Crawley resigned as editor in January 1956. In leaving, he ensured that the honour for ITN's success went to others&#151;though Day paid ample tribute to him in his memoirs. The departure also marked the end of Crawley's heyday, his promise not quite fulfilled.<br>
<br>By this stage Crawley was becoming disillusioned with socialism in the face of what he saw as trade-union obstructionism. He resigned from the Labour Party in 1957 and joined the Conservative Party late the same year. He later traced the roots of his disillusionment to his suggestion to Hugh Gaitskell in 1951 that the party drop clause 4 of its constitution. After resigning from ITN he returned to documentary-making and spent increasing amounts of time on his farm in Buckinghamshire, which he had bought in 1947. This was sold in 1962 after losses mounted. He also ranged across Africa, and was a member of the Monckton commission on the future of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, in 1960.<br>
<br>Crawley's friendship with Conservative politician Iain Macleod led to his selection in 1962 as Conservative candidate for the vacant seat of West Derbyshire. He was chosen from a shortlist which included Norman St John-Stevas. He narrowly won the by-election with a majority of 1220 over the Liberals. The result was a relief not just to Crawley but to Macleod, who, controversially, had promoted his candidature. At the general election of 1964 he was re-elected with a larger majority. Nevertheless, in parliament for a second time Crawley made little impact, apparently content that his election was proof enough that his talents had not departed after the ITN debacle. He served on the public accounts committee and an ad hoc committee of the Conservative Party which aimed to reform trade unions, by this time his major political interest.<br>
<br>By 1963 Crawley was considering applying for an independent television franchise and in 1966 he formed a consortium to apply for the London weekend franchise. This was awarded on 6 May 1967, and in October that year Crawley left parliament. London Weekend Television (LWT) went badly from the start; disagreement within the broad-based consortium, which included Rupert Murdoch, led to prolonged dispute. Crawley was forced out of the chairmanship in 1971, remaining as nominal president until 1973. In 1969 he published a well-reviewed biography, <span class="italic">De Gaulle</span>, following this with <span class="italic">The Rise of Western Germany, 1945&#150;72</span> in 1973.<br>
<br>From 1974 Crawley lived mainly abroad, in France, Spain, and Italy. In 1983 his wife, Virginia, died in a car crash; in 1988 his two sons were killed in a mountain air crash, flying their own plane near Turin in Italy. He moved to live with his remaining daughter, Harriet, in Northamptonshire; she survived him when he died, at Horton General Hospital, Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 3 November 1993, following a stroke. A memorial service was held at St Michael's, Chester Square, London, on 10 February 1994.<br>
