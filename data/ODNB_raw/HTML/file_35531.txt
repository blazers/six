<span class="headword">Pinsent <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Parker]</span>, Dame  Ellen Frances</span>  (1866&#150;1949), <span class="occ">promoter of the mental health services</span>, was born at Claxby, Lincolnshire, on 25 March 1866, the youngest of the eight children of Richard Parker, rector of Claxby, and his second wife, Elizabeth Coffin; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35388/', "Robert John Parker, first Baron Parker of Waddington")</script>, was a brother. There were a further five children from the Revd Parker's first marriage.<br>
<br>In 1888 Ellen married Hume Chancellor Pinsent (<i>d</i>. 1920), a solicitor who became a prominent figure in the university and civic affairs of Birmingham, where she was the first woman to be elected to the city council. Particularly interested in those termed the &#145;mentally unfit&#146;, she chaired the Birmingham special schools subcommittee, personally visiting all fifty-six Birmingham schools to ensure that all children who needed education in special classes (&#145;defectives&#146;) received it. She went on to formulate a &#145;complete scheme of state intervention&#146;, including care after school-leaving age, which was published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (1903). From 1904 until 1908 she sat on the royal commission on the care and control of the feeble-minded. After the consequent passing of the <span class="roman">Mental Deficiency Act</span> 1913 she was appointed an unpaid commissioner of the Board of Control. In that year she and her husband moved to Oxford. In 1921 she became a commissioner and in 1931 a senior commissioner of the board. From 1924 to 1929 she served on the Wood committee which examined the best way to deal with mental defectives, and whose report led to substantial improvements in arrangements for their care, particularly in community services. In 1932 she retired but continued to take an active part in questions of mental health. She received the honorary degree of MA from Birmingham University in 1919, and was appointed CBE in 1925 and DBE in 1937.<br>
<br>Dame Ellen was a pioneer in promoting legislation and furthering all measures for the welfare of the mentally unfit. Her experience in Birmingham had left her with the conviction that the care and training of defectives were public obligations, both for their own good and for the protection of society. She published four novels between 1892 and 1897, and an important review of the mental health services in Oxfordshire and Berkshire in 1937. Her many friends enjoyed her charm, gaiety, and warmth of heart. She and her husband had three children: a daughter, Hester Agnes, who married Edgar Douglas (later Lord) Adrian, physiologist and Nobel prizewinner; and two sons, one of whom was killed on active service in 1915 and the other in a flying accident in 1918. She died at her home, Rough Lea, Boars Hill, near Oxford, on 10 October 1949.<br>
