<span class="headword">Thistlethwayte <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bell]</span>,  Laura Eliza Jane Seymour</span>  (1831?&#150;1894), <span class="occ">courtesan and lay preacher</span>, was the daughter of Captain Robert H. Bell of Bellbrook, Glenavy, co. Antrim, and his second wife, Laura Jane Seymour, an illegitimate daughter of the third marquess of Hertford. She is believed to have been born at Glenavy, probably on 18 October 1831. After an unsupervised childhood, she left home at an early age to become a shop-girl and prostitute in Belfast, where she also appeared briefly and unsuccessfully on the stage. A move to Dublin about 1846 secured her finances to the extent that she was able to drive in Phoenix Park in her own carriage. It is difficult to establish the identities of her clientele, but she was reputed to have had an association with Dr William Wilde, the father of Oscar, and it is alleged that at this time she made the acquaintance of an unnamed official at Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>About 1849 Laura Bell moved to London, where she worked as a shop-girl in Jay's General Mourning House in Regent Street, whence she was removed by the Nepalese envoy, Prince Jang Bahadur, who set her up in a house in Wilton Place. He was recalled shortly afterwards, having lavished large sums of money upon her. Continuing her life as a courtesan in London and Paris, she drew much attention and admiration for her golden hair, blue eyes, beautiful figure, and sparkling demeanour by riding and driving a smart equipage in Hyde Park. Several lovers were attributed to her in this period, including Arthur Thistlethwayte who died in the Crimea in 1854, the brother of her future husband. There is also evidence that she was a friend of Sir Edwin Landseer, and may have had some hand in the modelling of one of the lions on his monument to Nelson in Trafalgar Square.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1852 Laura Bell retired from her profession and married (Augustus) Frederick Thistlethwayte (1830&#150;1887), a rich army subaltern, the son of Thomas Thistlethwayte and his second wife, Tryphena Bathurst, daughter of Henry Bathurst, bishop of Norwich. They first lived at 100 Westbourne Terrace, and moved in 1856 to 15 Grosvenor Square. The marriage was not a success, and there were no children. She was a spendthrift, and ran up huge debts, for which her husband was obliged more than once to deny responsibility, even going to court to limit his liabilities. In an unlikely turn of events, Laura Thistlethwayte became a lay preacher. There is no evidence of a conversion experience, and little to explain her actions. She declared herself to be a Methodist, and was invited to preach in Plymouth Brethren chapels and in the Polytechnic in London. Her greatest triumphs were in the Dingwall area of Scotland, where she had rented property from Lady Ashburton, and where her beauty, her jewellery, and her preaching held audiences spellbound; but she fell foul of the Free Church ministers and was held at arm's length by society.<br>
<br>In London, Laura Thistlethwayte held dinner parties for politicians and public figures, which gatherings her husband did not always attend, despite their almost exclusively male composition. In 1864 she began an extensive correspondence with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10787/', "William Ewart Gladstone")</script>, who was the executor of the late duke of Newcastle's will. Her connection with Newcastle may have dated from his period as chief secretary in Dublin in 1846; he had also been a guest at her dinner parties. The correspondence with Gladstone  (printed in appendices in volumes 7 and 12 of the Gladstone <span class="italic">Diaries</span>) lasted until her death in 1894, and reveals, in its first seven years, an intense intimacy potentially dangerous for the politician who addressed her as his &#145;Dear Spirit&#146;. Eventually Gladstone resolved to encourage her to mend her marriage, which had come close to complete breakdown, although he did not discontinue his visits to her house or end the correspondence. She persisted in making Gladstone gifts which she would not allow him to return, and which were to prove an embarrassment when she and her husband were sued for debts in 1878 and 1879. She became importunate in her demands for his attendance at social occasions when he was occupied with politics, and after this period the correspondence was continued on a more level tone. Their relationship was to be the subject of much salacious speculation, which was refuted by Gladstone's sons on evidence provided by him shortly before his death.<br>
<br>Frederick Thistlethwayte died on 7 August 1887 from a self-inflicted shot wound: he had been accustomed to summoning his servants by firing his pistol. His widow retired to Woodbine Cottage, Fortune Green Lane, Hampstead, where she died on 30 May 1894. She left her estate, some &pound;41,000, to Lord Edward Pelham-Clinton, the second son of the duke of Newcastle, with the condition that after his death the funds were to be used to provide &#145;a retreat for clergymen of all denominations, true believers and literary men&#146; at Woodbine Cottage; the foundation never came into existence. She was buried in Paddington Green cemetery, beside her husband.<br>
