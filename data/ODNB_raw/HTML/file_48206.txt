<span class="headword">Lyell,  James Patrick Ronaldson</span>  (1871&#150;1948), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was born on 1 September 1871 at 50 South Hill Park, Hampstead, London, the son of John Ronaldson Lyell, solicitor and chief clerk of the Thames police court, and his wife, Martha Elizabeth Groom. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at University College, London, and was admitted solicitor in April 1894. He eventually became senior partner of Gard, Lyell &amp; Co. He was a member of the Metropolitan Water Board (1910&#150;26) and in 1900 contested East Marylebone unsuccessfully as a Liberal. He served as an elder in the Presbyterian church at Hampstead, where he was also a justice of the peace and for many years chairman of the magistrates' bench.<br>
<br>Lyell was moderately well off but not rich. He married on 17 April 1901 Agnes Stuart (1863/4&#150;1949), daughter of James Stuart Balmer, civil servant, and they had one daughter, Agnes, who predeceased her parents. He began to collect books as early as 1889, and from 1891 to 1911 was especially interested in acquiring incunabula. In 1914 he began to take an interest in early Spanish books, and it was the lucky purchase, for only &pound;4, of a copy of the great Complutensian polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> (Alcal&aacute; de Henares, 1514&#150;17) which inspired him to write and publish in 1917 his first book, a life of Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros, archbishop of Toledo (<i>d</i>. November 1517), followed in 1926 by his best-known work, <span class="italic">Early Book Illustration in Spain</span>. The preparation of this book caused him to visit Spain several times and to learn Spanish. A new translation, with up-to-date notes, entitled <span class="italic">La ilustraci&oacute;n del libro antiguo en Espa&ntilde;a</span>, edited by J. Mart&iacute;n Abad, was published in Madrid in 1997. These two books on Spanish subjects are still standard works in their field. Lyell's Spanish and Armada collections are both now in America, mainly in Harvard University Library. He also collected Greek and oriental manuscripts, as well as English books printed abroad. While living in Hampstead he made a small collection of local topography and gave it to the public library there when he decided in 1927 to move to Oxford. He seems to have had little direct contact with the British Museum, except that in November 1943 he presented one French incunable to the museum, the library having bought three of his Italian incunables as early as 1920; but he was so devoted to the Bodleian that he made Oxford his headquarters and in 1932, at the age of sixty-one, having become a member of New College, he took the degree of BLitt for a thesis &#145;based on my collection of books relating to the Spanish Armada&#146;. About 1936 he changed his taste in collecting, and began to acquire medieval manuscripts, eventually accumulating about 250, of which in his will he bequeathed a choice of 100 to the Bodleian. These became the subject of the detailed catalogue published by A. C. de la Mare in 1971.<br>
<br>Lyell and his wife moved to Abingdon at some time before 1940. He died at the Warneford Hospital in Oxford on 23 December 1948, and his wife died a short time later. He was cremated and his ashes interred at Hampstead cemetery. Under the terms of his will, a Lyell readership in bibliography was established in Oxford, and the first lectures were delivered by his friend Neil R. Ker, university reader in palaeography and fellow of Magdalen College. In a paper which Lyell read to a society at Radley College in 1939, he remarked: &#145;I have written numerous articles and brochures on other books of mine&#146;; and &#145;I am at present engaged in the preparation of an annotated catalogue of some of my remaining manuscripts and books&#146;  (Lyell, 281). Lyell's personal and bibliographical papers, including his own miscellaneous notes on his manuscripts and their acquisition, were bequeathed to the Bodleian Library. As R. W. Hunt of the Bodleian noted in 1951: &#145;Lyell was never a social success, and made no attempt to ingratiate himself with anyone &hellip; His complete indifference to the ordinary standards of success may explain why his name is not even mentioned in books of reference&#146;  (Hunt, 69). Nevertheless, he was a self-taught bibliophile and scholar of extraordinary enthusiasm and discrimination, and one who deserves to be remembered not only by Oxford but by the whole bibliographical world.<br>
