<span class="headword">Concannon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Walsh]</span>,  Helena</span>  (1878&#150;1952), <span class="occ">historian and politician</span>, was born in Maghera, co. Londonderry, on 28 October 1878, one of the four daughters and three sons of Louis Walsh (<i>d</i>. 1917) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Donnelly, who were proprietors of Walsh's Hotel in Maghera. Both parents had strong nationalist credentials, her father being a member of the Irish Land League, and her mother having been a member of the Ladies' Land League. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64477/', "Louis Joseph Walsh")</script> became a member of Sinn F&eacute;in and a leading nationalist writer. The family was also devoutly Catholic: her brother Richard became a priest and her sister Alicia a nun. The Walsh children enjoyed lively and happy childhoods. They spent much of their time in the family kitchen where they enjoyed entertaining visitors and storytelling.<br>
<br>Helena Walsh's parents were avid readers who were interested in education and encouraged their daughter's academic potential. She was educated by the Loreto nuns in Coleraine and Dublin. An excellent student, she won three gold medals for her performance in intermediate examinations and in 1897 a three-year scholarship that allowed her to pursue her interest in modern languages at the Royal University of Ireland. In 1899, accompanied by her close friend and future professor of German at University College, Dublin, Mary Macken, she studied German at the Berlin University, before moving on to the Sorbonne to study French.<br>
<br>In 1902 Walsh proceeded MA at the Royal University, having graduated BA with first-class honours in 1900. Her student years were intellectually, culturally, and politically stimulating. She was in touch with student politics through her brother Louis, who had enrolled at University College, Dublin, and had quickly become a leading student politician and writer. Like her brother, she became active in the Gaelic League, studying the Irish language with Patrick Pearse. She remained dedicated to the restoration of the Irish language for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>In 1900 Walsh met her future husband, Thomas Concannon, who had returned to Ireland from America; he was the son of Patrick Concannon, a farmer. They married at Maghera on 23 July 1906. They later took up residence in co. Galway where their home, named Lios-na-Mara by Patrick Pearse, became a beacon for visitors prominent in the Irish cultural and political worlds. Thomas Concannon, also an active member of the Gaelic League, shared his wife's dedication to the Irish language, which he taught. Together they produced a number of Irish language textbooks and maintained a large circle of friends within the Irish language movement.<br>
<br>Helena Concannon secured a lectureship in Italian at University College, Dublin, in 1909, but the offer was withdrawn before she could take up the position, and she embarked on a writing career in earnest, while her husband became a civil servant. She experimented with a number of literary genres, publishing many poems, essays, and commentaries, but she was best known for her popular histories of Ireland. She produced over twenty books, most of them in the areas of women's history and religious history, as well as several textbooks. Her work was relentlessly nationalist and Catholic, prompting disapproval from a number of critics who denounced her children's history books in particular as ahistorical. Her <span class="italic">Irish History for Junior Grade Classes</span> was considered so overtly political that it was banned during the Anglo-Irish War, though it was resurrected under the Irish Free State.<br>
<br>Concannon herself was an advanced nationalist and anti-partitionist who supported Sinn F&eacute;in and opposed British rule in Ireland. Through her histories she lauded the innate spirituality of the Irish people, praising their constant resistance to the British presence. Her analysis of Irish history was very much based on the unshakeable twin pillars of Catholicism and patriotism. Her two most popular books about Irish women echoed these themes, praising the devotion of Irish nationalist women while emphasizing the centrality of women's spiritual and domestic role in the home to the well-being of the nation. She recognized that women had largely been omitted from most works of Irish history, but her own attempts to rectify this were often more prescriptive than analytical. Nevertheless, they proved to be enormously popular; her <span class="italic">Women of Ninety-Eight</span> (1919) went through several editions and long remained the standard text on the subject.<br>
<br>In the unsettled political climate of early twentieth-century Ireland, Concannon's books found a large audience among nationalists and language revivalists. Her work became even more popular after Irish independence, and in 1929 she was awarded a DLitt for her outstanding contribution to historical knowledge by the National University of Ireland. Her <span class="italic">Daughters of Banba</span> (1922) won a Tailteann gold medal in 1924 and <span class="italic">The Poor Clares in Ireland</span> (1929) was awarded the National University of Ireland historical research prize in 1929. <span class="italic">The Blessed Eucharist in Irish History</span> (1932) was nominated the &#145;golden book&#146; of the Eucharistic Congress of 1932, and even won the praise of Pope Pius XI himself, who sent Concannon the apostolic benediction. Her works on Irish women's religious history were innovative, as Concannon conducted research in institutional archives. They emphasized the spiritual resilience of Irish nuns in the face of English oppression and were well received in religious periodicals. Concannon herself contributed numerous articles on devotional subjects to Irish religious publications.<br>
<br>A strong supporter of Eamon De Valera, Concannon yielded to his pleas that she become more involved in party politics in 1933, when she was elected to the D&aacute;il as a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate for the National University of Ireland. After university representation in the lower house was abolished in 1937, she was elected to the senate, serving until her death. She spoke frequently on women's issues, supporting social welfare measures and strongly backing rural domestic economy schools. Her advocacy of such institutions underlined her belief that women's education should prepare them for their lives as bastions of Irish Catholic homes, though she herself boasted few such skills and employed a housekeeper. She also continued to emphasize the fierce independence and spirituality of the nation, making frequent appeals to Irish history and religion in her speeches. This did not endear her to some political opponents, and she incurred the particular wrath of feminists and fellow members of the Women Graduates' Association who condemned her for supporting De Valera's constitution of 1937, which contained several controversial clauses about women's roles. Her support in the 1940s for the censorship of allegedly explicit books revealed that her ideas about the social and moral purity of the nation overrode any belief she may have had in intellectual freedom.<br>
<br>Concannon died at the Bon Secours Hospital, Glasnevin, Dublin, on 27 February 1952, and was buried in Bothar M&oacute;r cemetery, Galway. Lauded by many fellow senators, colleagues, and friends as an outstanding Catholic and patriot, Concannon's reputation as a historian in particular has been questioned by later critics in the light of her sentimental and unscholarly approach to her subjects. Though her books appear amateurish and didactic to the modern reader, it is important to recognize that her work on women's history in particular was almost unique for its time and remains a useful starting point for modern scholars. She helped to pave the way for new generations of historians of Irish women.<br>
