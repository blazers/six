<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Charles</span>, styled ninth earl of Thomond  (1699&#150;1761), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, was born at St Germain-en-Laye and baptized there on 17 March 1699, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20442/', "Charles O'Brien, styled fifth Viscount Clare (1670&#150;1706)")</script>, outlawed in Ireland for his role in the Williamite wars, and his wife, Charlotte, eldest daughter of Henry Bulkeley, master of the household to James II. In 1703, as a child, Charles was commissioned captain and attached to the Franco-Irish regiment commanded by his father, to whose title he succeeded in 1706. He was a page at the French court. His active military career commenced in Spain in 1719 with the duke of Berwick, whose second wife was his mother's sister. He was present at the sieges of Fuenterrabi&aacute;, San Sebastian, Urgel, and Roses. In August 1720 he was appointed to command the regiment of Clare, remaining its colonel proprietor throughout the rest of his life. He visited his kinsman, the eighth earl of Thomond, in England on several occasions and was presented to George I. He might have had his father's attainder reversed to become Thomond's heir, save for his refusal to conform to the established church. He did, however, inherit &pound;20,000 on Thomond's death in 1741, styling himself thereafter as ninth earl of Thomond. He continued to maintain an exact and up-to-date knowledge of his family's former estate in Ireland, which he cherished hopes of recovering. Although he retained formal relations with James III (James Francis Edward Stuart), the Pretender, he took little active part in Jacobite politics, concentrating instead on his career in the French army. In 1733 he served under Berwick on the Rhine. He was promoted brevet brigadier of infantry in 1734, and at the siege of Philippsburg the same year he was grazed on the shoulder by the cannon shot that killed Berwick. He was advanced to brevet <i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i> in 1738 and was appointed inspector-general of infantry in 1741. He was posted to Bohemia the same year, displaying much resolution and bravery in the unsuccessful defence of Linz in 1742. After his release from captivity, Clare transferred to the army of the Rhine and fought at Dettingen in 1743. In the following year he was promoted lieutenant-general and transferred to Flanders, where he took part in several sieges. The Irish brigade under his command played a notable part in the French victories at Fontenoy (1745), Rocoux (1746), and Laffeldt (1747).<br>
<br>In 1745 a plan to send Clare to England to second the efforts of Prince Charles Edward Stuart in Scotland was frustrated by British naval superiority. He was made a chevalier of the order of the Holy Ghost in 1747 and was appointed governor of Neuf-Brisach in 1756. In recognition of his distinguished military record Clare was created a marshal of France on 24 February 1757. In November 1757 he was appointed to command the troops on the Mediterranean coast and made commander-in-chief of Languedoc. A year later he was accorded the honour of <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the king of France's bedchamber. In 1759 he featured prominently in French plans for an invasion of the British Isles, but the defeat of the French fleet forced the abandonment of this project. He was described as &#145;a gay flattering audacious Frenchman [who] was thought an Adonis by a set of ladies&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 3.254). Clare married late in life, on 10 March 1755, Marie Genvieve Louise (1737&#150;1763), daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois (Gauthier), marquis de Chiffreville, Normandy. His own means were &#145;very unconsiderable&#146;  (Fagan, 2.186), and his wife brought him a substantial fortune, which in time was expected to increase by inheritance. They had two children: Charles, seventh Viscount Clare (1761&#150;1774), who died unmarried, and Antoinette Charlotte Marie Septimanie (<i>b</i>. 1758), who married the duc de Choiseul-Praslin. Clare died of a fever at Montpellier on 9 September 1761.<br>
