<span class="headword">Proctor, Sir  (Philip) Dennis</span>  (1905&#150;1983), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Foxley Hatch, Godstone Road, Purley, Surrey, on 1 September 1905, the son of Sir Philip Bridger Proctor KBE (1870&#150;1940), a businessman and a senior civil servant during the First World War, and his wife, Nellie Eliza Shaul. He was educated at Harrow School (where he was a noted cricketer) and at King's College, Cambridge (1924&#150;8), achieving a first in both parts of the classics tripos. He was made an honorary fellow of the college in 1968.<br>
<br>In 1929, after a year at the University of Marburg, Proctor entered the civil service, serving first in the Ministry of Health, but soon switching to the Treasury, where he spent twenty years (1930&#150;50). For a short time he was assistant private secretary to Stanley Baldwin, then lord president of the council, but was transferred out of Baldwin's office because it was feared that Mrs Baldwin would not approve of his imminent appearance as co-respondent in a divorce case involving the woman who became his first wife, Dorothy Varda or Vardas (1900/01&#150;1951), whom he married on 4 July 1936. She had been divorced first from Jean (Janko) Varda or Vardas, artist, and second from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65309/', "Gerald Roberts Reitlinger")</script>, the art connoisseur, and the daughter of John Edwin Stewart, mechanical and electrical engineer. There were no children.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Proctor's work in the Treasury brought him into close contact with the Ministry of War Transport (he acquired a great interest in and knowledge of shipping), and he also served as principal private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, Kingsley Wood. He knew Keynes well during this time. From 1948 to 1950, as a Treasury third secretary, he had responsibility for dealing with the arts and science.<br>
<br>Proctor suddenly resigned from the civil service in 1950 to take a job with a shipping company in Copenhagen, but though he intended a permanent break with Whitehall this foray into the business world did not work out, and he was fortunate that in 1953 Sir Edward Bridges invited him to rejoin the civil service as deputy secretary in the Ministry of Transport. The suicide of his wife in 1951 was a shocking blow. On 29 August 1953 he married Barbara Forbes (1917&#150;2002), daughter of General Sir Ronald Forbes Adam, chairman of the British Council; the couple later adopted two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1958 Proctor was appointed permanent secretary at the Ministry of Power, a post he held until 1965. Having been appointed CB in 1946, he was created KCB in 1959. As a civil servant, in the words of his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary:<blockquote>he was an effective and popular colleague in a style all his own: practical sense and good judgment battled continuously with strong views and natural impatience. The only jobs he could not do were those &hellip; which involved suppressing his personality. Where force, originality and disregard of convention were required, he was first-rate. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Aug 1983)</blockquote>As permanent secretary he saw his main task as putting the right people into every job and then keeping them on their toes, the Ministry of Power winning a reputation as something of a centre of excellence in mid-1960s Whitehall. Under his supervision was developed the country's first explicit energy policy (he wrote a pioneering paper in his own hand in the late 1950s), and the framework for early North Sea oil exploration. In great secrecy, he prepared a plan for steel nationalization in the run-up to the 1964 election which he was able to present to the new Labour minister of power, Fred Lee, as he came out of no. 10.<br>
<br>Unusually, Proctor was chairman of the Tate Gallery, 1953&#150;9, while still a civil servant, having become a trustee of the gallery in 1952. A connoisseur of the arts, with many friendships in the art world, he was always passionate about painting. But he came into a difficult situation at the Tate, and there were huge battles with the then director which left their scars. He also served on the governing body of the Courtauld Institute and on a number of Gulbenkian Foundation arts committees.<br>
<br>Proctor believed strongly in the traditional values of a non-political civil service, but his own politics were firmly left-wing. He once said that at Cambridge he had been a Marxist, but he was never a member of the Communist Party. As a Cambridge Apostle, and a close personal friend of Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt, he inevitably came under suspicion as a Soviet agent and was investigated by MI5 in 1966. Blunt told his interrogators that Proctor had been one of Burgess's best sources, and Proctor himself admitted that he had no secrets from Burgess (adding he had &#145;no real secrets to give&#146;). The authorities seem to have concluded that there was no evidence of treason or other wrongdoing, and that while Proctor may have been indiscreet he was not an intentional or committed spy.<br>
<br>In retirement Proctor took a directorship at William Hudson Ltd, a shipping and fuel firm (1966&#150;71). His interest in the Vaucluse region of France (where he had a second home) inspired his book <span class="italic">Hannibal's March in History</span> (1971), praised as a piece of scholarly detective work about Hannibal's route through Gaul and over the Alps. <span class="italic">The Experience of Thucydides</span>, published in 1980, was the product of a lifelong interest in the subject. At Cambridge he had been profoundly influenced by Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson (and had indeed been Dickinson's last love). He took over Dickinson's papers from E. M. Forster and in 1973 published, with a sensitive introduction, the unexpurgated version of his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>. Proctor's intellectual curiosity and appetite for new experience never let up. Having a family late in life kept him young. He took up horse-riding in his fifties, studied A-level maths in his seventies, and began work on a layman's guide to astronomy. Diagnosed with cancer of the lung in 1982, he died at his home, 102 High Street, Lewes, Sussex, on 30 August 1983. His funeral was held on 9 September.<br>
