<span class="headword">Wilberforce <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Ogilvie-Forbes]</span>,  Marion Katherine</span>  (1902&#150;1995), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born at Boyndlie House, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on 22 July 1902, the daughter of John Charles Mathias Ogilvie-Forbes (1850&#150;1941), ninth laird of Boyndlie, and his second wife, Anne Marguerite Prendergast (<i>d</i>. 1950). Her father had originally studied for the Anglican priesthood but was received into the Roman Catholic church by Cardinal Newman, later becoming privy chamberlain to four popes. There were five children from his second marriage. Educated at Boyndlie House by a succession of French governesses, from an early age Marion also became involved in the day-to-day running of the estate. At fourteen she was entrusted with collecting rents from tenants. At sixteen she went to the Convent of Jesus and Mary at Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, and from there, in 1922, to Somerville College, Oxford, where she obtained a diploma in agriculture in 1925 and graduated in 1926. Through her agricultural interests she became involved in the work of the Fairbridge Farm Schools, a charitable organization that settled orphan children in agricultural communities in the dominions. Before her marriage she travelled widely, inspecting farm schools in Canada and Australia.<br>
<br>Marion knew Robert William Francis Wilberforce (<i>d</i>. 1984), who had been a contemporary of her brother David at Ampleforth College. After Oxford he was torn between life as a priest and matrimony. After six months testing the strength of his vocation as a monk at Ampleforth Abbey, he decided against it. Marion was waiting to collect him at the abbey gates when he emerged. They married in 1932 and bought their Essex farm, Nevendon Manor, where she kept chickens and bred pigs and cattle. The piglets she named after her brothers, reserving the name of her youngest brother, Malcolm, for the runt of the litter. Robert Wilberforce became a solicitor and a company director.<br>
<br>Encouraged by her two aviator brothers, Marion learned to fly at Stag Lane, gaining her pilot's licence in 1930. After successfully investing on the stock exchange she was able to buy her first aircraft, a de Havilland Cirrus Moth, later replaced by a Hornet Moth. These aircraft were registered as farm implements for tax purposes and used to ferry livestock. A trip to Europe to visit friends for lunch would be an opportunity to bring back some chickens or a calf placed in bags behind her seat. Flying with the minimum of instrumentation and navigating visually, if uncertain of her whereabouts she would land to ask the way or read a signpost. When civilian flying ceased in 1939, she had accrued 900 flying hours in this way.<br>
<br>In December 1939 Pauline Gower won her battle to form a women's section of Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). Though limited to fly non-operational aircraft and on 20 per cent less pay than males of equal rank, this signalled a breakthrough in the prejudice against female pilots. Wilberforce was invited to go to Whitchurch for flight testing and on 1 January 1940 she became one of the first eight women to report for duty at Hatfield no. 5 ferry pool. At first pilots were engaged in ferrying RAF Tiger Moths from the de Havilland factory at Hatfield to maintenance units and RAF stations as far afield as Scotland. However, the loss of pilots in the battle of Britain, allied to increased aircraft production, brought about a radical change and by the end of 1941 Marion was piloting Hurricanes, Spitfires, and twin-engine types and had taken over command of no. 5 ferry pool, Hatfield. Early in 1943 she moved to no. 12 ferry pool, Cosford, to take command of the second all-women pool of ATA, becoming in 1944 one of only eleven women qualified to fly the four-engine Lancaster and Stirling bombers. Often required to ferry many different types in a day, ATA pilots needed the versatility usually demanded only of test pilots. By mid-1945, on leaving the ATA, Wilberforce had flown some 2400 hours and over 100 different aircraft types. Characteristically, she declined the offer to become an MBE and proceeded to immerse herself in country life and peacetime flying, rarely speaking of her wartime exploits.<br>
<br>Wilberforce had begun hunting in 1933; on returning to Nevendon Manor she served on the committee of the Essex union hunt (1962&#150;82), becoming the only woman master of foxhounds in the hunt's 236-year history. A fearless rider, she hunted into her eighties, and having little faith in doctors, would obtain her medicines from the vet, claiming her horse was sick. In 1947 she co-owned a Hornet Moth G-ADKM with her brother Neil. Though the skies had become more regulated, Marion continued to fly around the British Isles visiting friends in the same happy-go-lucky way of pre-war days. Her post-war logbook indicates that she visited most European countries. She might lunch in Luxembourg, listen to music at the Vienna Staatsoper, or even take a sister-in-law to Paris to pick up Molyneux couture. On 5 May 1949 she set off to visit her brother Neil, then an air attach&eacute; in Moscow. Travelling via Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Stockholm, she arrived in Helsinki two days later. To her annoyance she had to leave the aircraft there and go by other means to Moscow. Acquiring another Hornet Moth G-AEZG in 1964, she continued flying until the age of eighty. By this time she had become disenchanted by all the rules and regulations imposed on the private pilot.<br>
<br>Having no children of her own, Marion Wilberforce continued a particular interest in the Fairbridge Farm Schools and was for many years chair of the child care committee. She often had Fairbridge children to stay with her. Though she could seem quite formidable at first, she is remembered as being kind and mothering the younger girls in the ATA ferry pool. On her husband's death in 1984 she returned to live with her brother Malcolm in the family home at Boyndlie. Now dilapidated with gardens overgrown and the family chapel derelict, they lived happily amid the decay. A stoic in old age and impatient of physical frailties, she refused to wear hearing aids. Her last months were spent in Stratford Park Nursing Home, Stroud, where she died on 17 December 1995. She was cremated at Stroud, but her ashes were interred at Markington Roman Catholic Church, Harrogate, Yorkshire, near the Wilberforce family home.<br>
