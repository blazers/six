<span class="headword">O'Bryan <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Bryant]</span>,  William</span>  (1778&#150;1868), <span class="occ">founder of the Bible Christians (Bryanites)</span>, was born on 6 February 1778 at Gunwen Farm, Luxulyan, Cornwall, the second son (and third of four children) of William Bryant (1733&#150;1796) and his wife, Thomasine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lawry, prosperous church Methodist farmers and tinners. The family claimed&#151;probably mistakenly&#151;descent from one of Oliver Cromwell's Irish officers who had settled in Cornwall, a tradition which William junior cherished to such an extent that by about 1810 he had assumed the name O'Bryan.<br>
<br>Bryant was educated at four local schools and then apprenticed to a St Austell draper, returning to Gunwen after the death of his father in 1796. Having undergone conversion experiences in May 1789 and November 1795, he had become a Wesleyan local preacher by 1803, the year in which he married, on 9 July, Catherine Cowlin (1781&#150;1860). In 1808, following a crisis caused by the death of his infant son, Bryant commenced work as a freelance evangelist in mid-Cornwall, forming several societies around Newquay. He had aspirations to enter the Wesleyan ministry but was turned down by the Cornwall district meeting in 1810 on account of his family responsibilities. This set-back reinforced his natural tendency to defy authority. He preached in disregard of the circuit plan and even proposed that the ministry be supported by voluntary contributions; and in November 1810 he was expelled by the Wesleyans, ironically at Gunwen Chapel, which he himself had built on land he had donated. He then engaged in independent evangelism on the western edge of Bodmin Moor, creating a group of societies which were absorbed into the Bodmin and Liskeard circuits in 1814 when O'Bryan was reconciled with the Wesleyans. His irregular evangelistic activities in the Stratton mission on the Cornwall&#150;Devon border from January 1815 soon led to further friction and a second expulsion, and on 1 October 1815 he established an autonomous circuit at Week St Mary, the creation of the first (Arminian) Bible Christian society following eight days later at Lake Farm, Shebbear.<br>
<br>O'Bryan dominated the Bible Christian Connexion during its early years, seeing its membership grow from 237 in 1816 to 8054 in 1827 and spread beyond Devon and Cornwall. Its theology and polity were avowedly Methodist, although its use of women preachers was more distinctive. O'Bryan occupied the movement's key offices, including those of general superintendent (1819&#150;26), president of conference (1819&#150;27), book steward (1819&#150;23), connexional editor (1822&#150;8), and secretary of the general missionary committee (1821&#150;2, 1825&#150;6, 1828&#150;9). He was also the author of its principal foundation documents, such as <span class="italic">The Rules of Society</span> (1818), and the official hymnbook (1824), as well as the first editor of, and regular contributor to, the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span>. However, from 1824 there was increasing resistance to his autocratic rule, and disputes over his control of preachers and chapels and his casual approach to connexional and personal finances came to a head in 1828, when he relinquished the conference chair. After losing a further power struggle in 1829, O'Bryan separated with two itinerants and several hundred members, who reassumed the name of Arminian Bible Christians.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1831 O'Bryan and most of his family sailed from Liverpool to emigrate to America; here he settled initially at Bethany, Connecticut, where two of his daughters kept a girls' school, and formed a Methodist circuit. For most of his American years, though, he was resident in New York and its vicinity, continuing to expound the gospel there and even undertaking preaching tours to Ohio and Canada, but never enjoying the scale of evangelistic success he had achieved in England. In 1835 most of those who had seceded in 1829 rejoined the Bible Christians, a condition of the reunion being that O'Bryan relinquished his copyright in the hymnbook and all other claims on the connexion in exchange for &pound;85 and an annuity of &pound;20. He visited England six times between 1834 and 1861, mainly to see relations and to renew old acquaintances in Devon and Cornwall, and latterly even preaching in Bible Christian chapels. He died at Brooklyn, New York, on 8 January 1868, and was buried in Greenwood cemetery, Brooklyn. William and Catherine O'Bryan had seven children, two sons and five daughters, one of whom, Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47048/', "Thorne, Mary (1807&#150;1883)")</script>], married Samuel Thorne, another prominent Bible Christian, and became a celebrated preacher in her own right.<br>
