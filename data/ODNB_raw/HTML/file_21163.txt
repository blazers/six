<span class="headword">Pallady,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>1515/16, <em>d.</em> in or before 1563), <span class="occ">household official and member of parliament</span>, was born of a yeoman family at Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire. He was educated as a king's scholar at Eton College from about 1529 and admitted to King's College, Cambridge, on 18 August 1533 at the age of seventeen; he was a fellow of the college in 1536&#150;7. From 1540 to 1548 he was an attorney in the sheriff's court of London; at some time during the same period he entered the service of the duke of Somerset, almost certainly under the patronage of his steward, Sir John Thynne, who had previously been a member of the household of Lord Vaux of Harrowden, lord of the manor of Irthlingborough, where Pallady was born. There is no evidence that he had any particular expertise in architectural matters and the attribution to him of the precocious design of Somerset House in the Strand, London (begun 1546), considered to be &#145;the most serious attempt to compose a classical facade yet seen in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the King's Works</span>, 4.252), cannot be substantiated. It is based on an unattributed description of Pallady as &#145;overseer of the works of the Duke of Somerset in the Strand&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) but he is not named among the &#145;cheiff and principall officers&#146;  (Pikarell) in the account roll drawn up after Somerset's execution, although he did account for over &pound;500 of ready money in his hands. The earlier description of him as &#145;clerk of the works to the said Duke&#146;  (Tytler, 272) in the list of prisoners lately committed to the Tower with Somerset in October 1549 would explain his possession of such substantial sums and suggests a more humble administrative role without design responsibility. He was released three months later without any formal charges being brought against him. In 1552 he was responsible for settling a number of Somerset's outstanding debts in Reading and elsewhere in Berkshire. His rehabilitation was completed later in the year when he resumed his seat in the House of Commons, to which he had been elected in 1547 for Peterborough. He was elected to the parliament of 1559 to represent Heytesbury, Wiltshire, where Thynne had an interest. By this date he had moved from Ruscombe, Berkshire, where he had been living for most of the decade, to the Thynne manor of Buckland in Gloucestershire. He was married before 1544 to Catherine, daughter of Guy Armston of Armston, Northamptonshire, and then to Anne, daughter of William Kirkby of Upper Rawcliffe, Lancashire. He died intestate before 27 March 1563, when letters of administration were granted to his widow.<br>
