<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Muir,  Frank Herbert</span>  (1920&#150;1998), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 5 February 1920 in the Derby Arms hotel, 72 Margate Road, Ramsgate, Kent, the younger son of Charles James Muir (1888&#150;1934), a steam tug engineer from New Zealand, and his wife, Margaret Webber (<i>b</i>. 1891). He was educated at schools in Ramsgate, Broadstairs, and Leyton, east London, before leaving at fourteen to join a firm of carbon paper manufacturers after his father suddenly died of pneumonia. A few years later, after the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the RAF&#151;because, as he recalled in characteristically droll vein, it seemed to him &#145;that in the RAF I would get to sit down more&#146;  (Muir, 62). In the event he had to sit, stand, and fall, learning parachuting and photography. He was stationed partly in Dorset and partly in allied-occupied Iceland, where he gained his first experience of radio broadcasting and performing comedy sketches to troops in Reykjav&iacute;k. He said he had had a &#145;soft war&#146;, never firing a shot in anger.<br>
<br>Muir was demobbed in 1945. Having set his heart on a life in comedy and begun to gravitate to the Windmill Theatre like so many other future stars, he sent material to Ted Kavanagh, the creator of the wartime radio hit <span class="italic">ITMA</span> who had subsequently founded his own company, Ted Kavanagh Associates, which trained young talent. Kavanagh used him to write for the rising comedian Jimmy Edwards in a comedy series called <span class="italic">Navy Mixture</span>. The writer for the show's other star, Dick Bentley, was Denis Norden, a Kavanagh employee. Thus the two men first came into contact. They went on to forge, over more than fifteen years, one of the most productive partnerships in British comedy history, considered as synonymous with scriptwriting as Morecambe and Wise were with television.<br>
<br>The first fruit of Muir and Norden's collaboration was a show commissioned by the producer of <span class="italic">Navy Mixture</span>, Charles Maxwell, <span class="italic">Take It From Here</span>, which ran on the Light Programme from 1948 to 1960 and broke new ground in its use of sophisticated wordplay and topical jokes and the way in which it acknowledged the literacy of the listener. One example of its wit was the line &#145;Infamy! Infamy! They've all got it in for me!&#146;, often recalled as a line first spoken by Kenneth Williams in a <span class="italic">Carry On</span> film but actually created by Muir and Norden and first uttered by Dick Bentley, as Caesar, on <span class="italic">Take It From Here</span>. Similarly, it was Muir and Norden who wrote the parody &#145;Bal-ham, Gateway to the South&#146;, which Peter Sellers made famous. The most famous part of the show, however, was &#145;The Glums&#146;, a lowlife family saga in which Jimmy Edwards was the male chauvinist pig of a father, Dick Bentley his moronic son Ron, and June Whitfield the perpetually swooning fianc&eacute;e, Eth.<br>
<br>Muir and Norden had much in common: both were former members of the RAF, both were extremely tall, and both were possessed of extraordinarily fertile minds and an apparently inexhaustible verbal dexterity. Muir was the elder by two years. They worked together in a small top room in the Kavanagh offices in Bruton Street, Mayfair, and developed an effective way of getting a lot of work done. They had only two chairs in their office, &#145;so that anyone dropping in for idle chatter became tired of standing after a few minutes, and drifted off&#146;  (Plomley, 146).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Take It From Here</span> became a huge hit. It made Muir and Norden hot properties. They wrote several radio series for the Canadian funny man Bernard Braden and his wife, Barbara Kelly, and were much in demand on television as it exploded in popularity. They created (in 1956) and wrote <span class="italic">Whack-o!</span>, with Jimmy Edwards as the conniving, cane-swishing headmaster of Chiselbury School. It ran for four years. They adapted Henry Cecil's <span class="italic">Brothers-in-Law</span> (1962), giving the young Richard Briers his first leading role. They appeared together as rival panellists in two exceptionally long-running radio panel games, <span class="italic">My Word!</span> (1956&#150;90), famous for its tortuous puns, and <span class="italic">My Music</span> (1967&#150;91). They wrote for summer seasons and rewrote for comedy films.<br>
<br>The 1950s, the main period of his partnership with Norden, was a happy decade for Muir. He married on 16 July 1949 Edith Ann Mary (Polly) McIrvine (<i>b</i>. 1925), a half-British, half-French former WRNS girl. They had a son, Jamie, and then a daughter, Sally. In 1953 they bought a former farmhouse in 2 acres of rough meadow in Thorpe, near Egham in Surrey, which became the family home and the heart of Muir's emotional security. In 1960 he and Norden appeared together as joint castaways on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span>. In 1963 he and Polly bought a holiday home on Corsica.<br>
<br>In 1964, when the scriptwriting partnership with Norden was dissolved (though not their friendship), Muir joined the BBC as assistant head of light entertainment. Two notable achievements were his purchase of <span class="italic">All Gas and Gaiters</span> (1967&#150;71), an affectionate ecclesiastical situation comedy starring William Mervyn, Derek Nimmo, and Robertson Hare, and <span class="italic">The World of Wooster</span> (1965&#150;7), with Ian Carmichael and Dennis Price (unsurpassable as Jeeves), of which he was executive producer.<br>
<br>After three years at the BBC Muir left to join a new ITV contractor, London Weekend Television. But when in 1969 a boardroom coup ousted its first managing director, Michael Peacock, he and other executives resigned in protest and he &#145;reverted to being self-unemployed&#146;  (<span class="italic">WW</span>). This was an unnecessarily self-deprecating assessment. Freelancing was what he was best at. He was in demand everywhere. On radio he made more than 100 editions of an anthology show, <span class="italic">Frank Muir Goes into &hellip;</span>, which he co-wrote with Simon Brett and presented with an old RAF comrade, Alfred Marks. On television he became a household name through the BBC2 word game <span class="italic">Call my Bluff</span>, in which he was a polished team captain for more than twenty years opposite Robert Morley, then Patrick Campbell, and finally Arthur Marshall. Making lucrative television commercials, he donned an Edwardian swimming costume for Hovis and sang &#145;Everyone's a fruit and nut case &hellip;&#146; to the strains of the <span class="italic">Nutcracker</span> suite to advertise a Cadbury's chocolate bar.<br>
<br>None of this taxed Muir particularly. Behind the dandified, languid manner, the pink bow tie, and the pipe, was a self-taught, formidably well-read man and gifted writer. His literary output included an anthology entitled <span class="italic">The Frank Muir Book: an Irreverent Companion to Social History</span> (1976); sixteen <span class="italic">What-a-Mess</span> books for children about his family's problematical Afghan hound; <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose</span> (1990), which ranged from Caxton to Wodehouse; a novel, <span class="italic">The Walpole Orange</span> (1993); and finally his warm and gentle autobiography, <span class="italic">A Kentish Lad</span> (1997). He was awarded two honorary degrees, an LLD from St Andrews University, where he was rector (1978), and a DLitt from the University of Kent (1982). Muir and Norden were both appointed CBE in 1980. Muir's scholarship was also recognized when he was invited to become president of the Johnson Society in Lichfield for 1975&#150;6; he argued in his presidential address that Samuel Johnson had a more pronounced sense of humour than either eighteenth-century manners or Boswell's biography allowed him to display. Not for nothing did <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> call him a &#145;philosopher of laughter&#146;.<br>
<br>Anners, the house Muir had bought with his wife in the 1950s, was where he spent most of his time in his closing years and where he wrote his funny, modest, bestselling memoirs. He died there of heart failure on the morning of 2 January 1998; his wife and children survived him. He was buried ten days later in the parish church where he worshipped, St Mary's, Thorpe, and with him in the coffin his family placed a copy of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> review of <span class="italic">A Kentish Lad</span>, in which the reviewer had paid tribute to Muir's &#145;enormous fund of curious learning&#146;.<br>
