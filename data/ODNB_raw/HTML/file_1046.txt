<span class="headword">Bagshawe <span class="st"> [Bagshaw]</span>,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Apostle of the Peak]</span>  (1628&#150;1702), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 17 January 1628 at Litton in the parish of Tideswell, Derbyshire, and baptized on 19 January at Tideswell, the eldest son of William Bagshawe (<i>d</i>. 1669), yeoman of Litton, and his first wife, Jane, daughter of Raphe Oldfield of Litton. Educated at a number of local schools, his religious development was greatly influenced by two local clergyman, John Rowlandson, vicar of Bakewell, and Immanuel Bourne, vicar of Ashover. By the age of fifteen Bagshawe believed that he had a call to the ministry. Although his father, who eventually became a wealthy landowner in the Peak and took the title of gentleman, had communicated his own puritan beliefs to his son, he sought to dissuade him from a clerical career. When the elder Bagshawe's efforts failed he partially disinherited his son. William matriculated in 1646 as a sizar from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 1648 he preached his first sermon and served as a probationer at Wormhill, Tideswell, for several months. At the age of twenty-one he was appointed as an assistant minister to James Fisher at Sheffield and also served as a domestic chaplain to Colonel John Bright at nearby Attercliffe. Bagshawe was ordained at the Chesterfield classis on 1 January 1650 with his former spiritual mentor Bourne serving as temporary moderator. On 11 June 1650 he married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1701), daughter of Peter Barker of Darley, Yorkshire, with whom he had two sons, John (<i>b</i>. 1654) and Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1656).<br>
<br>Admitted to the living at Glossop, Derbyshire, on 31 December 1651, Bagshawe was to remain in the parish for nearly twelve years. On 20 March 1654 he was voted assistant to the Classical Assembly, representing the hundred of Low Peak. During his ministry at Glossop he wrote at least three works, two of which are no longer extant. The most significant of these was probably his <span class="italic">Brief Directions for the Improvement of Infant Baptism</span> (1658), which contemporaries claimed showed that Bagshawe limited baptism to the children of believers and performed the ordinance in public worship, preceding it with a sermon. Edmund Calamy wrote of Bagshawe that &#145;His Administration of the Sacraments, especially that of the Lord's Supper was with great solemnity and care&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.198). Over this period he also acquired a reputation locally for being a considerable theologian and conscientious pastor.<br>
<br>Unable to conform at the Restoration, Bagshawe was ejected from his living in 1662 and retired to his father's estate at Ford Hall, Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire. Though a committed presbyterian, he was also a partial conformist and for &#145;several years attended the Publick Worship in his Parish-Church, both parts of the Lord's Day&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.199). At the same time he continued his preaching activities, often travelling over huge tracts of sparsely inhabited Pennine moorland to be present at conventicles, earning for himself the name the Apostle of the Peak. In 1669 Bagshawe's father died and although his inheritance had been considerably reduced on entering the ministry he did come into possession of the Ford Hall estate. From 1670 he enjoyed a greater degree of financial independence and Ford Hall became a focus for presbyterian activity in the Peak region. At the declaration of indulgence in 1672 Bagshawe took out a licence to preach as a presbyterian at any licensed building and regularly conducted worship at Glossop, Ashford, Malcoffe, Middleton, Bradwell, Chelmorton, Hucklow, and Ford Hall. During the late 1670s several warrants were issued against him, but he managed to avoid arrest and appeared to enjoy a degree of protection from sympathetic local magistrates.<br>
<br>Between 1672 and 1702 Bagshawe wrote a further sixteen works, although only eight of these were published during his lifetime and seven were never published. His literary output was considerable and at his death he left an enormous mass of manuscripts that amounted to fifty volumes, folio, quarto, and duodecimo. The most significant of his later publications were <span class="italic">De spiritualibus pecci</span> and his <span class="italic">Essays on Union to Christ</span>, which was published posthumously. The former provided an account of the development of protestantism in north Derbyshire, and gives an insight into Bagshawe's attitude towards his flock. While he praised the godly clergy and gentry of the Peak he also noted the &#145;scarcity paucity &amp; scarceness&#146; of his co-religionists among other groups, singling out the local lead miners for particular condemnation  (Wood, 191). Nevertheless presbyterian strength in Derbyshire owed a great deal to his evangelistic endeavours. From the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span> (1689) until his death, he preached regularly to ten congregations. During this period Ford Hall was used over the summer months as a centre for study and prayer for Derbyshire presbyterians. Early in 1688 Bagshawe allowed the hall to be used as an academy for training presbyterian ministers and appointed Samuel Ogden to serve as a tutor alongside himself. When the better-equipped academy at Attercliffe became established, Bagshawe felt no qualms in closing down and sending his students there.<br>
<br>From 1698 Bagshawe's health began to deteriorate and his preaching activities became increasingly focused upon Ford Hall, though he continued to visit his congregations as often as he could. On 15 October 1701 he had his will drawn up and in November that year his wife, Agnes, died. Bagshawe died on Wednesday 1 April 1702 after a brief illness and was buried in the chancel of Chapel-en-le Frith parish church on 5 April. On his deathbed, hearing those around him lament that he could not preach to his congregation as usual he replied &#145;my silence is a sermon&#146;. His nephew, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/747/', "Revd John Ashe")</script> of Ashford, who subsequently published a life and character of Bagshawe in 1704, preached his funeral sermon. This work is the main source of information about the Apostle of the Peak. In his will, Bagshawe made charitable bequests to four Derbyshire parishes. The inventory of his goods amounted to &pound;268 8<i>s</i>., of which his considerable library was valued at &pound;152 10<i>s</i>.<br>
