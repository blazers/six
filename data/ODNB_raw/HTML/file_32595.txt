<span class="headword">Cowell,  Edward Byles</span>  (1826&#150;1903), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, born in St Clement's Street, Ipswich, on 23 January 1826, was the eldest son (in a family of three sons and one daughter) of Charles Cowell (<i>d</i>. 1842), who had inherited a successful business of merchant and maltster, and as a cultured Liberal was active in local affairs. His mother was Marianne, elder daughter of Nathaniel Byles Byles of the Hill House, Ipswich, also a successful merchant of that town.<br>
<br>Cowell was precocious, attending Ipswich grammar school from his eighth year. In 1841 he compiled a few numbers of the <span class="italic">Ipswich Radical Magazine and Review</span>, in which he showed sympathy with his father's politics, combined with a singularly wide reading in classical literature. He was first drawn to oriental literature in 1841 after finding in the public library of Ipswich a copy of Sir William Jones's works, including the <span class="italic">Persian Grammar</span> and the translation of Kalidasa's &#145;Sakuntala&#146;. In the same year his reading of Macaulay's essay on Warren Hastings made him aware of Horace Hayman Wilson's <span class="italic">Sanskrit Grammar</span>, a copy of which he promptly acquired. Meanwhile he took his first steps in Persian, at first by himself, but soon with the aid of a retired Bombay officer, Major Hockley, who probably also initiated him into Arabic. As early as 1842, while still at school, he contributed to the <span class="italic">Asiatic Journal</span> a number of verse renderings from the Persian.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1842 Cowell was taken from school to be trained for the management of the family business. But during the next eight years, while engaged in commerce, he read in his spare time with extraordinary zeal and variety. Of his scholarship and breadth of knowledge he soon gave proof in a series of contributions to the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, writing on oriental and Spanish literature. At the same time he formed the acquaintance of many who shared his interests, among them the Arabic and Persian scholar William Hook Morley and the Persian scholar Duncan Forbes, and he also called on Carlyle in London. In 1846 he sought an introduction to &#145;the great professor&#146;, Horace Hayman Wilson, and four years later he read in the East India Library and obtained a loan of a Prakrit manuscript (Vararuci's &#145;Prakrta-Praka&#347;a&#146;), his edition of which (1854) was destined to establish his reputation as a Sanskrit scholar. Through John Charlesworth, rector of Flowton near Ipswich, whose daughter Elizabeth Susan (<i>c</i>.1812&#150;1899) he married on 23 October 1847, he came to know the poet and translator Edward FitzGerald, the best-known of his many friends and correspondents. Their correspondence at first related chiefly to classical literature. It was Cowell who gave FitzGerald his first lesson in the Persian alphabet.<br>
<br>In 1850, the next brother being now of an age to carry on the Ipswich business, Cowell matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, going with his wife into lodgings. &#145;I went there [to Oxford]&#146;, he wrote later, &#145;a solitary student, mainly self-taught; and I learned there the method of study&#146;. During the six years of his university life he greatly widened his social circle, receiving visits not only from FitzGerald, who read Persian with him, but from Tennyson and Thackeray, to whom FitzGerald introduced him. He saw much of Jowett, Morfill, Max M&uuml;ller, and Theodor Aufrecht, and was greatly aided by the lectures and tuition of the Sanskrit professor, Horace Hayman Wilson. In 1854 he took a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and an honorary fourth in mathematics. While missing the scholarship in Hebrew, he was awarded a special prize of books. The next two years were spent in coaching, chiefly in Aristotle's <span class="italic">Ethics</span>. He also catalogued Persian and other oriental manuscripts for the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Cowell had made a reputation by his oriental publications. A translation of Kalidasa's &#145;Vikramorva&#347;&#299;&#146;, though finished earlier, was published in 1851. His admirable edition of Vararuci's &#145;Prakrta-Praka&#347;a&#146; followed in 1854. On taking his degree he wrote on the Persian poets for <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, besides contributing to <span class="italic">Oxford Essays</span> (1855) an essay on Persian literature.<h2>
<a name="InIndia"></a>In India</h2>In June 1856 Cowell was appointed professor of English history in the re-formed Presidency College, Calcutta. His post involved him in arduous work. He soon instituted an MA course in the Calcutta University, and extended the themes of his lectures to political economy and philosophy. In 1857 Cowell became secretary of the Vernacular Literature Society, founded with the object of providing Indian readers with translations of good English literature. At the same time he was increasingly attracted to missionary work. He held <span class="roman">Bible</span> readings in his house on Sundays, and a number of conversions resulted, not without some risk of offence to his Hindu connections. One of his chief Calcutta friends was William Kay, principal of Bishop's College. Meanwhile he pursued oriental studies untiringly. Persian continued to fascinate him. Of two copies which he procured of the manuscript of &#145;Umar Khayyam belonging to the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, he sent one to FitzGerald. His own important article on &#145;Umar Khayyam appeared in the <span class="italic">Calcutta Review</span> in March 1858.<br>
<br>Having passed the government examinations in Hindustani and Bengali, Cowell undertook in 1858 an additional office at Calcutta, that of principal of the Sanskrit College founded by Warren Hastings. Cowell's predecessor was a native Indian scholar. His relations with the pandits of the college were soon close and affectionate. By their aid he acquired a profound knowledge of the scholastic Sanskrit literature in rhetoric and philosophy, while he stimulated the pandits' scholarly activity, and often gratified them with a prepared speech in Bengali and a Sanskrit &#145;&#346;loka&#146;. Many Indian editions of works on rhetoric and poetry which were published in the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Indica</span>, a series issued by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, of which he became early in 1858 a joint philological secretary, express their indebtedness to Cowell. His own Sanskrit publications during this period also appeared chiefly in the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Indica</span>. With Dr R. Roer he continued the edition of the <span class="italic">Black Yajur Veda</span> (vols. 1 and 2, 1858&#150;64), which he afterwards carried on alone&#151;it was ultimately finished by its fifth editor in 1899; and singly he edited two <span class="roman">Upanisads</span>, the &#145;Kaustaki&#146; (1861) and the &#145;Maitri&#146; (1863; translation added 1870). The most important of his works at this time was his edition and translation of the &#145;Kusumanjali&#146; with the commentary of Haridasa (1864). The book, which in respect of difficulty might be compared with the <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span> of Aristotle, supplies a Hindu proof of the existence of God. Cowell read it with Mahe&#347;a Candra, whose name he associated with his own on the title-page, and the edition was dedicated to Max M&uuml;ller. He made a close study of the &#145;Siddhanta-Muktavali&#146;, a philosophical work, which he used as a college manual and examination textbook, and of the &#145;Sarvadaraanasamgraha&#146;, of which he translated one chapter, relating to the Carvaka system (<span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>, 1862). He contemplated full translations of both books.<br>
<br>One of Cowell's last official duties in India was to visit the Tols (Indian quasi-colleges) at Nadia, which were homes of pandit research and had last been inspected by Wilson in 1829. His report, published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span> for 1867, supplied interesting details concerning the teaching methods of these institutions, and has become one of the more important sources for the history of indigenous Indian Sanskrit education and philosophical discourse.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEngland"></a>Return to England</h2>By the spring of 1864 the state of Cowell's health demanded a furlough. With his oriental scholarship immensely strengthened he revisited England. His original intention of returning to India was not realized. In the summer of 1865 he became examiner in oriental subjects to the civil service commission; in the same year he refused a curatorship at the Bodleian and in 1866 a similar position at the British Museum. Occupying himself in varied literary work, he recommenced his general reading and renewed his contact and correspondence with FitzGerald.<br>
<br>In 1867 the University of Cambridge bestowed on Cowell the newly founded professorship of Sanskrit. Theodor Aufrecht was another candidate, but Cowell was warmly supported by Max M&uuml;ller and many eminent scholars and friends. He was elected on a general vote of the university by ninety-six votes to thirty-seven. He published his inaugural lecture on the Sanskrit language and literature in 1867. The remainder of his life was spent happily at Cambridge. In 1874 he became a fellow of Corpus Christi College. He retained the professorship and the fellowship until his death in 1903. During those thirty-six years his time was unstintingly given to his duties. He announced each term a formidable list of lectures, generally delivered at his own house. At first he lectured not only on Sanskrit but also on comparative philology, and became one of the founders of the Cambridge Philological Society, with which he was connected as auditor until the close of his life, and he contributed to the early numbers of the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> (from 1868). In 1884 a lecturer was appointed to take charge of the more elementary Sanskrit teaching. Nevertheless, the pupils who read with Cowell were of all grades of proficiency, ranging from undergraduates grappling with their first Sanskrit play to eminent scholars (both English and foreign) eager to elucidate the various Indian philosophies, the Vedic hymns, the &#145;Zendavesta&#146;, or the Pali &#145;Jataka&#146;. Alone or with his pupils Cowell issued an imposing series of Sanskrit texts and translations, of which the most important are <span class="italic">The Sarva-Dar&#347;ana-Samgraha</span> (translated with A. E. Gough, <span class="roman">Oriental Series</span>, 1882); <span class="italic">Divyavadana</span> (edited with R. A. Neil, 1886); <span class="italic">The Buddha Karita of A&#347;vaghosha</span> (<span class="roman">Anecdota Oxoniensia</span>, <span class="roman">Aryan Series</span>, 8, 1893), with translation in <span class="roman">Sacred Books of the East</span>, 49, 1894; <span class="italic">The Jataka</span>, translated under Cowell's editorship (6 vols., 1895); <span class="italic">The Harsacarita of Bana</span> (translated with F. W. Thomas, Oriental Translation Fund, new ser., 1897). Many of these and his exegetical and secondary works have been of lasting value and are still used over a century later by students and scholars of classical Indian literatures and philosophies.<br>
<br>Outside Sanskrit, Cowell still pursued other interests. Persian he resumed as opportunity offered. Spanish he always kept up, reading <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, at first with FitzGerald, and after his death with other friends in Cambridge. His Hebrew notes were used by Dr Kay in 1869 for the second edition of a translation of the book of <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and later he studied the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>. About 1877 he took up archaeology and architecture, a new study which led him to translate into English Michelangelo's sonnets, two of which were published in George Cowell's <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Edward Byles Cowell</span>. Welsh poetry and the science of botany had been passing fancies of Cowell's youth. During 1870&#150;80 they were cultivated simultaneously in vacations spent in Wales, sometimes in company with the Cambridge professor of botany, (Charles) Carsdale Babington. The Welsh studies, which were inspired by Borrow's <span class="italic">Wild Wales</span>, culminated in a masterly paper on the poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, read before the Cymmrodorion Society in 1878, and published in <span class="italic">Y Cymmrodor</span> (July 1878). Cowell's manuscript translation of this poet's work is in the university library at Cambridge. Botany remained one of the chief pleasures of his later life, and his scientific interests extended to geology. He collected a complete flora of Cambridgeshire, and gave expression to his botanical enthusiasm in some charming sonnets.<br>
<br>In 1892 Cowell was prevailed upon to accept the presidency of the Arian section of the International Congress of Orientalists held in London. His inaugural address (comparing rabbinical and Brahmanical learning) and his charming Sanskrit &#145;&#346;loka&#146; made a very favourable impression. In 1895 he was made an honorary member of the German Oriental Society. In 1898 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Asiatic Society, then bestowed for the first time. Among Cowell's other distinctions were the honorary LLD of Edinburgh University in 1875 and the honorary DCL of Oxford in 1896. In 1902 he was chosen as one of the original members of the British Academy.<br>
<br>Cowell's last publication was a verse translation, revised after thirty years, of some episodes from an old Bengali poem, &#145;Candi&#146;, which he had read at Calcutta and subsequently with Bengali students at Cambridge (<span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>, 1903). Although he continued to lecture, he had long been conscious of failing powers when he died at his residence, 10 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge, on 9 February 1903. He was buried at Bramford, near Ipswich, beside his wife, who had predeceased him on 29 September 1899. They had no children. His wife's sister was the author Maria Louisa Charlesworth.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Cowell founded a scholarship in Sanskrit at the Sanskrit College in Calcutta (1878), and endowed a prize for classics at his old school in Ipswich; by his will he devised to Corpus Christi College the sum of &pound;1500 for a scholarship in classics or mathematics, besides leaving his library for distribution between that college, the university library, the Fitzwilliam Museum, and Girton College.<br>
<br>Cowell was remarkable for the versatility of his knowledge of language and literature and for the breadth of his scholarly interests. Primarily a modest, patient, and serious savant, he was at the same time an accomplished man of letters, who excelled as an essayist, a familiar correspondent, and someone who could write charming and thoughtful verse. An unusual tenacity and subtlety of intellect appear in his mastery of Sanskrit logic and metaphysics (Nyaya and Vedanta). A chronological list of his writings is appended to George Cowell's 1904 biography.<br>
