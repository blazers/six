<span class="headword">Pratt,  Samuel</span>  (1658&#150;1723), <span class="occ">dean of Rochester</span>, was born in London on 2 June 1658 and baptized on 10 June at St Gabriel Fenchurch, the third and youngest child of Daniel Pratt, painter, and his second wife, Jane. There were also, it appears, five children from his father's previous marriage. After attending Merchant Taylors' School from 1666 to 1677 Pratt probably studied at Cambridge. He married young: Samuel, the eldest child of Pratt and his wife, Anne, was born on 29 June 1680. They had six more children.<br>
<br>Pratt was ordained deacon and priest (London) on 4 March 1683 and was inducted as rector of Kenardington, Kent, six days later. He resigned on becoming vicar of All Hallows, Tottenham, Middlesex, where he was instituted on 18 November 1693. He was listed as chaplain to two regiments of dragoons: in 1685 Colonel John Berkeley's and in 1687 the princess's. The Treasury paid for printing his contribution to the recoinage debate, <span class="italic">The Regulating Silver Coin</span> (1696): Pratt supported William Lowndes's case for devaluation, which John Locke mistakenly persuaded the government to resist. On 25 February 1697 he was chosen minister of the Savoy, and by royal mandate, dated 20 April, was created DD at Cambridge from St Catharine's College.<br>
<br>Pratt was one of Princess Anne's chaplains and tutor to her son, William Henry, duke of Gloucester. At Tunbridge Wells in summer 1697 Pratt &#145;studied Fortification very hard, and made a pentagon, with out-works, in a wood near the Wells, for the Duke's improvement and entertainment&#146;  (Lewis, 96&#150;7). At Anne's request he was named canon of Windsor on 27 November 1697, and on 28 July 1698 he was made almoner to the duke of Gloucester. When his elder brother John, a lawyer, died in 1699 Pratt inherited his estate at Stratford Langhorne, Essex.<br>
<br>Between 1697 and 1704 Pratt published five sermons. In 1706 Queen Anne presented him to the deanery of Rochester, where he was installed on 9 August, and made him clerk of the closet. Francis Atterbury, who became his bishop, appears to have disliked him: he recommended young Samuel Pratt to Jonathan Trelawny as being &#145;no ways like his father&#146;  (2 Nov 1717, in Atterbury, 3.339). He was vicar of Goudhurst, Kent, from 15 August 1709 until his resignation in 1713 and of Twickenham, Middlesex, from 21 January 1713 until his death.<br>
<br>After many years' work Pratt's two-volume <span class="italic">Grammatica Latina in usum principis juventis Britannicae</span> (which reprints the popular Latin grammar known as William Lily's, with extensive notes and conjectures) was published in 1722 and a compendium of it the following year. A rival, Solomon Lowe, attacked him in <span class="italic">A Proposal for Perfecting a Latin Grammar</span> (1722). Pratt died on 14 November 1723 and was buried ten days later in St George's Chapel, Windsor, where a memorial to him was erected. His will, dated 4 October 1723, gave &pound;50 to Christ's Hospital, London, as well as making bequests to his wife and family.<br>
