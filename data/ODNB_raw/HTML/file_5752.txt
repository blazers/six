<span class="headword">Cochrane, Sir  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1604, <em>d.</em> in or after 1657), <span class="occ">army officer and diplomat</span>, was the eldest of the nine children of Alexander Blair (<i>d</i>. 1640/41), who assumed the name Cochrane on his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of William Cochrane of Cochrane, Renfrewshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. Alexander Cochrane purchased the barony of Cowdown in 1623, but resigned it to his second son, William. Having been educated at Glasgow University, where he graduated MA in 1623, John Cochrane entered the army, and served in Ireland, acquiring land through his marriage to Lady Grace Butler, allegedly a cousin of the duke of Ormond.<br>
<br>On his return to Scotland he became an active covenanter and commanded a regiment at the sieges of Carlaverock and Threave (1639&#150;40). He became a client of Montrose and was also linked to the Palatine&#150;Bohemian connection. In 1640 the elector Palatine asked Cochrane to sound out Montrose about service abroad. In 1641 he was implicated in &#145;the incident&#146;, a plot for seizing Hamilton and Argyll, leaders of the parliamentary party; but, on his arrest, he was freed without bail on their petition (17 November). After resigning his Scottish estates (19 December 1642) to his next brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5759/', "William Cochrane")</script>, later first earl of Dundonald, he joined the king at York. Recommended to Charles by his sister, Elizabeth of Bohemia, he was sent by the king to solicit help in men or money, first to the Netherlands and then to Denmark, Christian IV being the uncle of Charles I. On his return in company with the Danish ambassador, who aimed to mediate between the king and parliament, Cochrane was arrested and imprisoned in Hull and in Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>Having regained his liberty, he was put in command of Towcester, from where he complained to Prince Rupert (16 December 1643) that the town would fall unless the garrison was better supplied. After the royalists abandoned Towcester (18 January 1644), Cochrane appears at Oxford, the royalist headquarters; he soon headed north with Montrose to attempt a counter-invasion of Scotland (March). After another visit to the Netherlands Cochrane, now knighted, was sent as ambassador to Denmark (1644), but the Danish&#150;Swedish War (1643&#150;5) left Christian IV little opportunity to help his nephew. His estates were forfeited (1644) and parliament, in its peace negotiations with the king (1646) listed Cochrane among those to be excepted from pardon.<br>
<br>For almost a decade he was employed in raising money for the royal cause in Denmark, Hamburg, Danzig, and Poland, especially from the duke of Courland (1645&#150;50). The wordiness of his letters and his account of negotiations at Hamburg confirm the estimation of Charles I that he was a man &#145;having many discourses, most of his own praises&#146;  (Simpson, 144). Although successful in raising supplies, he seems to have been dilatory in explaining his dealings, and in 1650 Charles II sent an apology to Scottish merchants in Poland for Cochrane's unauthorized exactions. In 1650 he was prohibited by the Scottish parliament from returning to his own country. On 26 February 1652 his wife, who was in prison in England (probably for aiding her husband's enterprises), secured a pass for him to return to England, which he did in 1653. Until 1657 his name occurs in various political negotiations, but he probably died before 1660.<br>
