<span class="headword">Colvile, Sir  James William</span>  (1810&#150;1880), <span class="occ">judge in India</span>, was born on 12 January 1810 in London, the eldest son of Andrew Wedderburn (<i>d</i>. 1856), of Craigflower and Ochiltree, Fife, and his wife, the Hon. Louisa Mary Eden (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of William, first Baron Auckland (1744&#150;1814). His father, who assumed the surname of Colvile on 22 June 1814, was the founder of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Eden Colvile (1819&#150;1893), governor of Rupert's Land from 1849 to 1852, was his younger brother.<br>
<br>Colvile was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1827 and graduated BA in 1831, ranked third in the second class of mathematical honours, and MA in 1834. He was an intimate friend at Cambridge of Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton. Admitted to Inner Temple in 1832, he was called to the bar in Hilary term 1835, and for ten years practised as an equity draftsman in chambers in Lincoln's Inn. He became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1866.<br>
<br>In 1845 Colvile was appointed advocate general of Bengal. He was young for the post, but at least ten other nominees had turned it down in the wake of a discomforting row in the House of Lords over the unscrupulous readiness of the East India Company's directors to appoint their dependants to such lucrative situations. Colvile's own links with India were not insignificant; his uncle George Eden had been governor-general from 1835 until 1841. In 1848 he was raised to the bench as a puisne judge of the supreme court of Bengal and was knighted (9 December 1848) and in 1855, in succession to Sir Lawrence Peel, he was appointed chief justice. On 3 April 1857 in Calcutta Cathedral he married (Frances) Elinor (1838&#150;1919), eldest daughter of John Peter Grant, of Rothiemurchus, a future lieutenant-governor of Bengal and governor of Jamaica.<br>
<br>Colvile acquired a reputation in Bengal as a learned and courteous man, helpful and friendly to his juniors. He was an active president of the Asiatic Society and opened relations between it and the Royal Society, of which he afterwards became a fellow. He retired from the chief justiceship and returned to Britain in 1859. With the youthful Lady Colvile's care, his London residence at 8 Rutland Gate, Hyde Park, was soon established as a small but select salon, patronized by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Robert Browning, Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot), J. A. Froude, Mrs George Grote, Frederick Leighton, John Millais, Alfredo Piatti, and George Frederic Watts. In April 1875 he was elected FRS. Colvile, however, never retired from legal work. Soon after his return from India he was sworn a privy councillor to act, with Sir Lawrence Peel, as an Indian assessor to the council's judicial committee. In November 1865 he was made a member of that committee, and in 1871, under the <span class="roman">Judicial Committee Act</span>, he was appointed one of its four paid judges (at an annual salary of &pound;5000) who were charged with clearing the backlog of appeals to the privy council. He was the senior of these judges when he died suddenly, on 6 December 1880, at his house, 8 Rutland Gate, Hyde Park, London. He was buried on 11 December 1880 at his estate, Craigflower, near Dunfermline, Fife, of which county he had been a JP and deputy lieutenant. He was survived by his wife; their only child, Andrew John Wedderburn, born in 1859, had died in 1876. In recollection of Colvile, Alexander Kinglake wrote that, even in youth, he was thought of as &#145;the true model of the sterling, the wise, the highly-bred English Gentleman&#146;  (Kinglake to Lady Colvile, 7 Dec 1880, Strachey MSS, BL, Add. MS 60633, fol. 90).<br>
