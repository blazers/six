<span class="headword">Hope,  Charles</span>, Lord Granton  (1763&#150;1851), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 29 June 1763, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13729/', "John Hope (1739&#150;1785)")</script>, MP for Linlithgowshire (and great-grandson of Charles Hope, first earl of Hopetoun), and his wife, Mary (1741/2&#150;1767), only daughter of Eliab Breton of Forty Hill, Enfield, and granddaughter of Sir William Wolstenholme, bt. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13732/', "Sir John Hope")</script>, army officer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13739/', "Vice-Admiral Sir William Johnstone Hope")</script> were his brothers. He was educated at Enfield grammar school, and afterwards at Edinburgh high school, where in 1777 he became the Latin dux. After studying law at Edinburgh University he was admitted an advocate on 11 December 1784, and on 25 March 1786 was appointed a depute advocate. Although not an outstanding lawyer he was an accomplished public speaker at tory political meetings. On 5 June 1792 he became sheriff of Orkney, and in the following year, on 8 August 1793, he married his cousin, Lady Charlotte Hope (1771&#150;1834), the second daughter of John, second earl of Hopetoun, and his third wife, Lady Elizabeth Leslie, second daughter of Alexander, fifth earl of Leven and Melville. They had four sons and eight daughters; the eldest boy was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13733/', "John Hope (1794&#150;1858)")</script>, and the youngest girl was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53690/', "Louisa Octavia Augusta Hope (1814&#150;1893)")</script>.<br>
<br>In June 1801 Hope was appointed lord advocate in the Addington administration in place of Robert Dundas of Arniston and shortly afterwards was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh for his assistance to the magistrates in obtaining a bill for the poor of the city. At the general election in July 1802 he was returned to the House of Commons for Dumfries district, but resigned when Henry Dundas was made a lord, and was returned unopposed for the city of Edinburgh in January 1803. As lord advocate Hope saw through the House of Commons the <span class="roman">Scotch Parochial Schoolmasters' Act</span> which compelled heritors to build houses with two rooms for the schoolmasters. His only speech to be reported in the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> was delivered in his own defence in the debate on Whitbread's motion for the production of papers relating to Hope's censure of a Banffshire farmer named Morison, who had dismissed his servant for attending drills of a volunteer regiment. Hope made an ingenious defence, and gave a lively description of the duties of his office. Though the case against him was strong, the motion was defeated by 159 to 82.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1804 Hope was appointed an ordinary lord of session and lord justice clerk in the place of Sir David Rae, Lord Eskgrove, and assumed the title of Lord Granton. He took his seat on the bench on 6 December 1804. On 12 November 1811 he succeeded Robert Blair of Avontoun as lord president of the court of session, being succeeded as lord justice clerk by David Boyle. In 1820 he presided at the special commission for the trial of high treason at Glasgow and his <span class="italic">Charge Delivered to the Grand Jury of the County of Stirling on 23 June 1820</span> was published (1820). On 17 August 1822 he was admitted to the privy council at Holyroodhouse. On 29 July 1823 he was appointed, together with his eldest son John, on the commission of inquiry into the forms of process and the course of appeals in Scotland. His <span class="italic">Notes by the Lord President on the Subject of Hearing Counsel in the Inner House</span> were published as a pamphlet (1826). When James Graham, third duke of Montrose, died in December 1836, Hope became lord justice general, when the post was combined by statute with the office of lord president of the court of session.<br>
<br>Hope was a man of imposing presence, with a magnificent voice, which, according to Lord Cockburn, &#145;was surpassed by that of the great Mrs Siddons alone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 160). Though politically partisan, and without tact or judgement, &#145;his integrity, candour, kindness, and gentlemanlike manners and feelings gained him almost unanimous esteem&#146;, according to Cockburn  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 1, 308&#150;9). His charges to juries were persuasive and impressive. Lockhart left a graphic account of Hope's imposing bearing on the bench in <span class="italic">Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk</span> (2, 1819, 102&#150;8).<br>
<br>When the volunteer movement began during the Napoleonic wars, Hope enlisted as a private in the first regiment of Royal Edinburgh volunteers. He was afterwards appointed lieutenant-colonel of the corps, and performed his duties for several years, until the regiment was disbanded for the second time in 1814. He daily inspected the volunteers on duty at Edinburgh Castle while the regular troops were on duty in the western counties. Hope's famous regimental orders of 18 October 1803 are given at length in Cockburn's <span class="italic">Memorials</span> (pp. 187&#150;94).<br>
<br>Hope retired from the bench in the autumn of 1841 and was succeeded as lord president by David Boyle. He died at his home, Granton House, 12 Moray Place, Edinburgh, on 30 October 1851 and was buried on 4 November in the mausoleum at Hopetoun House. His wife predeceased him on 22 January 1834.<br>
