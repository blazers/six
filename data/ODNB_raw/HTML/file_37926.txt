<span class="headword">Sabatini,  Rafael</span>  (1875&#150;1950), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 29 April 1875 in Jesi, Italy, the only son of Maestro-Cavaliere Vincenzo Sabatini and his English wife, Anna Trafford, both opera singers. He was educated at the <i>&eacute;cole cantonale</i> in Zug, Switzerland, and in Portugal at the <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> of Porto and at Coimbra. He settled in England as a young man, and married Ruth Goad Dixon (<i>b</i>. 1875/6) on 9 August 1905; he became a British citizen in 1918. His first novel, <span class="italic">The Tavern Knight</span>, was published in 1904, and for the next forty-five years his books appeared with almost annual regularity to an increasingly receptive public, while his short stories found a ready market in popular magazines. He was adept at using the same basic plot in various forms, and a number of his short stories were eventually expanded into full-length novels.<br>
<br>Sabatini's early work showed the influence of the late Victorian romancers, Stanley Weyman in particular. As his writing matured and he acquired that extensive knowledge of European history which informed all his work, he developed a highly distinctive narrative technique in which the romantic element, while always present, was often the handmaiden of the history which was his passion. Fiction was his forte, but he also produced two notable historical works: <span class="italic">The Life of Cesare Borgia</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition</span> (1913). There was biography too: <span class="italic">Heroic Lives</span> (1934), and three volumes of short studies, <span class="italic">The Historical Nights' Entertainments</span> (1918, 1919, and 1938), in which he investigated numerous historical controversies and personalities. He wrote six plays, none of which proved as popular as his books.<br>
<br>It was while Sabatini was serving in War Office intelligence during the First World War that he had his first major success, with <span class="italic">The Sea Hawk</span> (1915), a swashbuckler <i>par excellence</i> about an Elizabethan Englishman who becomes a leader of Barbary corsairs. It established Sabatini not only as a leading historical novelist, but as the foremost exponent of the pirate story, a reputation confirmed in 1922 with <span class="italic">Captain Blood</span>, and its two sequels, <span class="italic">The Chronicles of Captain Blood</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Captain Blood</span> (1936).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Captain Blood</span> Sabatini demonstrated his mastery of the art of blending fiction with soundly researched historical fact. It is based on two real lives, that of Henry Pitman, an English surgeon who escaped to the West Indies after being condemned by Judge George Jeffreys for complicity in the Monmouth rising, and of Sir Henry Morgan, whose piratical exploits Sabatini adapted from Alexander Esquemelin's firsthand account, <span class="italic">The Buccaneers of America</span>, and attributed to his fictional hero, Dr Peter Blood. He used this technique time and again&#151;&#145;history disguised as fiction&#146;, as his publicists called it, not unjustly, for if he took occasional liberties with the letter of historic truth, he was never false to its spirit. The backgrounds to his stories, the detail of customs and manners, no less than the greater matters of politics, religion, and warfare, were as accurate as long study and careful research could make them.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Scaramouche</span> (1921), which is rivalled only by <span class="italic">Captain Blood</span> as Sabatini's most popular work, is a case in point. The story of a young lawyer who, in pursuit of vengeance on a murderous aristocrat, becomes in turn a political agitator, an itinerant actor, and a fencing-master, provides a genuinely instructive survey of the early days of the French Revolution; it also earned Sabatini a curious accolade. He was meticulous about opening and closing sentences, and Yale University inscribed on a college building the first words of <span class="italic">Scaramouche</span>: &#145;He was born with a gift of laughter, and a sense that the world was mad.&#146;<br>
<br>While there were few periods from the thirteenth century to the Victorian era which Sabatini did not touch, the French Revolution was one of his favourite settings, as was Renaissance Italy. Nowhere was he more at home than among the <i>condottieri</i>, whose subtleties and stratagems were reflected in his own ingenious plots, and if there was a historic figure he admired, perhaps to excess, it was Cesare Borgia.<br>
<br>In 1927 Sabatini's son and namesake, Rafael, was killed in a car accident, and in 1932 Sabatini and his wife were divorced. On 5 March 1935 he married Christine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), formerly the wife of Hugh Wainwright Dixon. They made a home for themselves at Clock Mills, Clifford, Herefordshire, where Sabatini enjoyed fishing in the River Wye, although he also retained his memberships at the Garrick, Savage, and Author's clubs in London.<br>
<br>The success which Sabatini's books enjoyed was immensely enhanced by motion pictures. <span class="italic">The Sea Hawk</span>, <span class="italic">Scaramouche</span>, and <span class="italic">Bardelys the Magnificent</span> were made into successful silent films, but it was with the sound version of <span class="italic">Captain Blood</span> (1935), starring the fledgeling Errol Flynn, that Sabatini reached a worldwide audience. There followed <span class="italic">The Black Swan</span> (1942), and remakes of <span class="italic">The Sea Hawk</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Scaramouche</span> (1952), featuring such leading players as Tyrone Power, George Sanders, Flora Robson, and Stewart Granger.<br>
<br>Sabatini's popularity did little for his literary reputation. The critical establishment tended to dismiss him as a romantic swashbuckler, but he was admired and respected by fellow authors for his mastery of narrative and plot construction, the accuracy of his character studies (among them a merciless portrait of Frederick the Great in <span class="italic">King in Prussia</span>, another of James I in <span class="italic">The Minion</span>, and memorable cameos of Wellington, Elizabeth I, Danton, Drake, Henry VIII, and many others), and his inimitable style. It was urbane, sardonic, faintly academic, and occasionally elaborate, but always clear, the style of a man who knows exactly what he is talking about and assumes, without condescension, that his reader knows too. These were virtues enough to set against the charge of romanticism, but his greatest gift was the ability to bring the past to life in vivid and convincing colours, and to enthuse millions of readers with his own love of history.<br>
<br>&#145;Admirers who met Sabatini in the flesh found a tall, well-built, likable, approachable and unaffected man with reddish hair, flashing hazel eyes, and the features of one of his own Cesares&#146;  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 1218). Sabatini died after a skiing accident on 13 February 1950 at the Nevada Palace Hotel, Adelboden, Switzerland. He was survived by his wife, Christine.<br>
