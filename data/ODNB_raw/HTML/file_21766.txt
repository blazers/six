<span class="headword">Peel, Sir  William</span>  (1824&#150;1858), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third and favourite son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel, second baronet (1788&#150;1850)")</script>, prime minister, and his wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Floyd (1795&#150;1859), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9773/', "Sir John Floyd")</script>, was born on 2 November 1824. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21765/', "Sir Robert Peel, third baronet")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35451/', "Sir Frederick Peel")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35450/', "Arthur Wellesley Peel, first Viscount Peel")</script>. After private school and Harrow School, Peel entered the navy in April 1838 on board the <i>Princess Charlotte</i>, carrying the flag of Sir Robert Stopford as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, and was present at the operations on the coast of Syria in 1840. He was afterwards in the <i>Monarch</i>, and in the <i>Cambrian</i> in China with Captain Henry Ducie Chads, returning to England in the troopship <i>Belleisle</i> in September 1843. In November he joined the gunnery ship <i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth, and in May 1844 passed his examination with the greatest credit.<br>
<br>On 13 May, Peel was promoted lieutenant and ordered to the <i>Winchester</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Josceline Percy at the Cape of Good Hope. In May, before he could join the <i>Winchester</i>, he was appointed to the <i>Cormorant</i> in the Pacific. From her he was moved to the <i>Thalia</i>, and afterwards to the <i>America</i>, from which he carried out a secret intelligence mission to report on the Columbia/Oregon territory, then at the centre of an Anglo-American dispute. He then returned with dispatches overland from San Blas to Vera Cruz, and thence to England. In February 1846 he was appointed to the <i>Devastation</i> at Woolwich; in May to the <i>Constance</i> at Plymouth; and on 27 June 1846 he was promoted commander. In 1847&#150;8 he commanded the <i>Daring</i> on the North American and West Indies station, and on 10 January 1849 was promoted captain.<br>
<br>Anticipating a period on half pay, Peel decided to explore the interior of Africa, with the hope of doing something to improve the condition of the inhabitants. In preparation he studied Arabic, under the tuition of Joseph Churi, a Maronite educated at Rome, and in September 1850 proposed to Churi that they should make a short tour to Egypt, Mount Sinai, Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Syria. They left England on 20 October, and were back by 20 February 1851. On 20 August following they left on the longer and more serious journey. They went up the Nile, across the desert to Khartoum, and on to al-&#145;Ubayd, where they suffered a severe attack of fever and ague. Peel returned to England early in January, and published an account of the journey, <span class="italic">A Ride through the Nubian Desert</span> (1852).<br>
<br>In October 1853 Peel commissioned the frigate <i>Diamond</i>, attached to the fleet in the Mediterranean, and afterwards in the Black Sea. He served with the naval brigade landed for the siege of Sevastopol, under the command of Captain Stephen Lushington, and repeatedly distinguished himself by his bravery. On 18 October 1854 he threw a live shell, the fuse still burning, over the parapet of his battery. On 5 November, in the battle of Inkerman, he joined the officers of the Grenadier Guards, and helped to defend their colours. On 18 June 1855 he led the ladder party at the assault on the Redan, himself carrying the first ladder, until severely wounded. For these services he was nominated a CB on 5 July, and on the institution of the Victoria Cross he was one of the first recipients.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1856 he commissioned the <i>Shannon</i>, a powerful 50-gun steam-frigate, for service in China. She did not sail until the following March. At Singapore she was met by the news of the Indian mutiny, and took Lord Elgin up to Hong Kong, arriving on 2 July. Admiral Sir Michael Seymour sent the <i>Shannon</i> back to Calcutta on July 16, with Elgin on board, together with a detachment of marines and soldiers. At Calcutta, Peel formed a naval brigade. On 14 August he left the ship with 450 men, six 24-pounder Bengal artillery guns, and two 8 inch howitzers. At Allahabad on 20 October he was reinforced by a party of 120 men, and from then on was present in all the principal operations. The coolness of his bravery was everywhere remarkable, and his formidable battery gave most efficient service: the huge guns were, under his orders, moved and worked as though they were light field pieces. On 21 January 1858 he was nominated a KCB and an aide-de-camp to the queen.<br>
<br>In 1858 Peel's brigade employed six naval 8 inch guns from the <i>Shannon</i>. Peel mounted these massive weapons, weighing 65 cwt each, on carriages locally constructed by the sailors. They provided the firepower to overcome the massive walls of Indian forts, and to keep down British casualties.<br>
<br>In the second relief of Lucknow on 9 March 1858 Peel was severely wounded in the thigh by a musket bullet, which was cut out from the opposite side of the leg. Still very weak, he reached Cawnpore on his way to England, and there, on 20 April, he contracted smallpox, of which he died on 27 April, aged thirty-three. He never married. His services in the field were the highlight of the Lucknow campaigns. His men achieved unparalleled feats of arms and endurance that broke the will of the enemy.<br>
<br>Peel was an officer distinguished alike for his bravery and his resourcefulness. He benefited from the rapid promotions provided for the son of a prime minister, although his father never actively solicited them; however, no one ever doubted that he was a worthy recipient. In creating a legendary Victorian hero, concentrating on his courage and tragic death, his hagiographers did scant justice to his professional skill and intellectual achievements. His death deprived the navy of one of its most brilliant officers; his career had only just begun.<br>
