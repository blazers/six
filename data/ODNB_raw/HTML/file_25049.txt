<span class="headword">Selby,  Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>George Henry Wilson]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1802&#150;1863), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was in 1832, as Charles Selby, a member of the company at the Strand Theatre, and two years later produced a farce, <span class="italic">The Unfinished Gentleman</span>, at the Adelphi. He worked out the idea of this piece in a series of papers which appeared in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and were reprinted with illustrations by Thomas Onwhyn in 1841 as <span class="italic">Maximums and Speciments of William Muggins, Natural Philosopher and Man of the World</span>. From the quasi-autobiographical revelations in this work (which is in the main a dull and unskilful imitation of the earlier style of Charles Dickens) it appears that Selby was self-educated, had visited Barbados, and had some nautical experience. He worked with his wife, Clara (1796/7&#150;1873)&#151;whose real name was Sarah Susannah&#151;under W. C. Macready at Drury Lane during the 1841&#150;2 season.<br>
<br>During his thirty years as an actor and playwright Selby performed principally character parts and supplied a long series of plays, mainly farces and burlettas&#151;about ninety in all, according to Allardyce Nicoll&#151;many of which were adapted from the French. Among his most successful pieces were <span class="italic">Robert Macaire</span> (1836), a three-act melodrama which had a long life on the stage and became one of Henry Irving's stock pieces. <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span> (1841) was a dramatization of Dickens's novel, put on the stage midway through the novel's serial publication; Dickens was irritated by this, but wrote to Selby that &#145;if I could give you a patent for dramatizing my productions I would gladly do so; inasmuch as if they <i>must</i> be done at all, I would rather have them done by gentlemanly hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 2.333). Most of Selby's dramatic output consisted of one-act pieces of a light and pleasant nature, and several were included in Duncombe's, Webster's, and Lacy's collections of plays. In works such as <span class="italic">The Valet de Sham</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Powder and Ball! or, St Tibb's Eve!</span> (1845, a &#145;terpsichorean burletta&#146;), <span class="italic">Taken in and done for</span> (1849), and <span class="italic">The Pirates of Putney</span> (1863, a &#145;nautical extravaganza&#146;), Selby provided a considerable number of successful vehicles for himself and his fellow actors, including Frederick Yates, Edward Wright, Henry Compton, Robert and Mary Ann Keeley, Louisa Nisbett, and Harriet Waylett. He was a useful actor, with a good stage presence. He also published a school textbook, <span class="italic">Events to be Remembered in the History of England</span> (1851), which ran through many editions, and a skit, <span class="italic">The Dinner Question, by Tabitha Tickletooth</span> (1860). He died of dropsy and ague at his home, 17 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, on 21 March 1863, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Selby was survived by his wife, a competent actress who specialized in middle-aged and elderly characters. After Selby's death she took pupils who wanted to go on the stage: they included Ada Cavendish. Clara Selby died on 8 February 1873.<br>
