<span class="headword">Rimmel,  Eug&egrave;ne</span>  (1820&#150;1887), <span class="occ">perfumer</span>, was born in France, the son of a scent manufacturer. With his father, under whom he served as an apprentice, he established a shop and laboratory in London in 1834. There is a record of its existence at 39 Gerrard Street, Soho, from 1847 to 1857, when it moved to 96 Strand, taking over premises that once belonged to Charles Lillie, one of the first perfumers in London and author of <span class="italic">The British Perfumer</span> (1822). There were branches of Rimmel's shop at 24 Cornhill from 1859 to his death, and at 128 Regent Street from 1864 to 1886, as well as in Paris. He married in the early 1840s and was naturalized as a British subject in September 1857.<br>
<br>In his laboratory Rimmel developed some of the earliest commercially manufactured beauty products, which by the middle of the nineteenth century were beginning to replace home-made cosmetics. He was most famous for the introduction of the first factory-made, non-toxic mascara, previously made at home from the oily residual soot from oil-burning lamps, or from powdered charcoal, both of which were often polluted and irritated the skin. From 1854 Rimmel employed women as well as men in his factory because of their superior dexterity: he claimed to be the first perfumer in England to use female labour. As the business became established he began to export his products, which included perfume, toilet soap, and ointments, and by the 1850s he was selling them in Europe, the Americas, and throughout the British empire. By 1862 he could describe himself as &#145;perfumer to their majesties the Queen of Spain and King of Portugal&#146;; he eventually collected ten royal warrants. Adept at marketing, he labelled his products with designs by the French lithographer Jules Ch&eacute;ret, of whom he was a patron.<br>
<br>Rimmel was constantly experimenting, and one of his inventions was the &#145;perfume vaporiser&#146;, which he exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington: a piece of apparatus for diffusing the fragrance of flowers and purifying the atmosphere, it was used on Queen Victoria's yacht as well as at public banquets and in ballrooms, theatres, and sickrooms. At the exhibition the water in the great fountain was perfumed with an essence provided by Rimmel, and his stand included &#145;magic vines, bouquets, flowers and rings for the holding of delicious scents, with perfumed sachets, almanacks, etc., standing beside rows and piles of soaps, pomades, creams, pastes, elixirs, dentifrices, washes, powders, cosmetiques, and other essentials of the fashionable toilet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Exhibitor</span>, 186). His other inventions included scented books and cards, and perfumed cushions. Rimmel served on the jury of the 1862 International Exhibition, where he drew up the official report on the perfumery class, and he wrote about the Paris Exhibition of 1867 for <span class="italic">Le Courrier de l'Europe</span> and <span class="italic">La Patrie</span>, publishing these articles as <span class="italic">Souvenirs de l'exposition</span>, with the English version, <span class="italic">Recollections of the Paris Exhibition of 1867</span>, published in 1868.<br>
<br>In 1865 Rimmel published <span class="italic">The Book of Perfumes</span>, an illustrated history of the making of perfumes and cosmetics from Egyptian times onwards. While acknowledging that London and Paris were the centres for the manufacture of perfumes, he argued that perfumes are best produced in warm countries where the climate gives the flowers an intensity of colour and odour, and that the best perfumery materials come from the south of France: Rimmel owned flower gardens and distilleries in Nice. He ridiculed the idea that flowers should be cultivated in England for perfumery purposes: England excels in the cultivation only of lavender and peppermint, because its moist and mild climate gives a mildness of fragrance, whereas in warmer countries these are too strong. But he thought that English toilet soaps were the best in the world. While he refused to give away the secrets of his recipes, he did describe the twelve series of materials used in the manufacture of perfumes, including the floral series, with the eight flowers used for perfume; the herbal series; the seminal series, including aniseed, fennel, and caraway; the citrine series, such as orange, lemon, and bergamot; and the artificial series, containing all the artificial flavours produced by chemical compounds. The most useful series from the perfumer's point of view was the animal series, because animal secretions resist evaporation the longest: these include musk, civet, and ambergris (found floating on the sea after being thrown up by the diseased sperm whale). These animal materials, though unpleasant on their own, when combined with other perfumes produce fragrances unobtainable in any other way.<br>
<br>At the 1862 International Exhibition Rimmel was struck by the pungent smell of essential oils, including eucalyptus, derived from the Australian forests, which were intended for mixing with paint instead of turpentine, and he experimented with using these in toilet soaps: this was so successful that he included eucalyptus among his perfumery materials. Agreeing with Rousseau that the sense of smell is the sense of imagination, he claimed that pleasant perfumes exercise a cheering influence on the mind, and refresh the memory, recalling scenes from past life. He offered ladies a few words of advice on the choice of perfumes and cosmetics, recommending perfumes that use the simple extracts of flowers, and he did not advise using paints for the face: &#145;cold water, fresh air, and exercise, are the best recipe for health and beauty; for no borrowed charms can equal those of &#147;A woman's face, with nature's own hand painted&#148;&#146;.<br>
<br>As he built up his fortune, Rimmel became an important benefactor among the French community in London. In 1878 he founded the French hospital and dispensary in Leicester Place, and he also founded the Bureau de Bienfaisance (later the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Bienfaisance) in Poland Street. He set up a fund to support the Society of the Professors of French. He also had literary interests, visiting Victor Hugo in Guernsey, and in 1886 he translated the first act of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> into French. He died of heart disease and dropsy on 25 February 1887 at 96 Strand, London, leaving two sons. The firm of Rimmel survived through the twentieth century, becoming the leading brand of colour cosmetics in Britain, and was acquired by Coty Inc. in 1996.<br>
