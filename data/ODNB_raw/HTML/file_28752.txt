<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warneford,  Samuel Wilson</span>  (1763&#150;1855), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was perhaps born at Warneford Place, in the hamlet of Sevenhampton, attached to Highworth vicarage, north Wiltshire. His family, one of the most ancient in that district, owned the manor and all the land in Sevenhampton. Samuel Wilson was the younger son of the Revd Francis Warneford (1732&#150;1784) of Warneford Place, who married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1757), daughter of Samuel Calverley, a wealthy drug merchant of Southwark, and his third wife, Catherine, residing at Ewell, Surrey. Money from the Calverleys greatly enriched the Warnefords. He matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 14 December 1779, and graduated BA (18 June 1783), MA (23 May 1786), BCL (10 July 1790), and DCL (17 May 1810). He was ordained priest in 1787, becoming curate of Norton Broyne (later Brize Norton).<br>
<br>Warneford married, at Colney Hatch, Middlesex, on 27 September 1796, when he was described as &#145;of Broughton, Oxfordshire&#146;, Margaret (1775&#150;1840), eldest daughter of Margaret and Edward Loveden Loveden (afterwards Edward Pryse Pryse, MP) of Buscot, Berkshire, and his own property was augmented by his wife's fortune. His wife, previously a ward of court, was sickly but rich. In due course, and in the face of strong hostility from Edward Loveden, a marriage settlement was reached linking the two fortunes. Deaths in both families subsequently further augmented Warneford's capital, his wife being left &pound;34,000 by her grandfather. In 1809 Warneford purchased the advowson of the rectory of Lydiard Millicent, Wiltshire; he held the rectorship until his death, but sold the advowson to Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1828. In 1810 he also bought the advowson of the vicarage of Bourton on the Hill, Gloucestershire. On the creation of honorary canonries in the cathedral of Gloucester in June 1844 his name was placed first on the list, and he remained an honorary canon until his death.<br>
<br>Warneford was an energetic and sharp manager of his and his wife's money and soon became known as an able man of business who expected high standards of his colleagues. He gave his donations gradually, so as to expose and be able to correct errors and deficiencies in the bodies to which he gave them. He did not sermonize, and, beyond his general intention to be a philanthropist, his priorities are chiefly to be inferred from his charitable actions, which were considerable. He became one of the governors of the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, which in 1812 appointed a committee to establish a lunatic asylum for persons &#145;who though poor were not Paupers&#146;  (Beckwith, 25). Warneford was one of the subscribers. He was a member of the hospital and of the building committee, becoming impatient in 1831 at the slow progress in building the Radcliffe Asylum, as it was initially known. He particularly worked with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27241/', "Vaughan Thomas")</script> on the asylum's development. Warneford's donations (over &pound;70,000 in money and property over his lifetime) and his active involvement led to its being renamed the Warneford Lunatic Asylum in 1843.<br>
<br>The churches of Bourton and Moreton in Marsh were refitted and improved by Warneford at a cost of &pound;1000 each. He built and endowed at Bourton a &#145;retreat for the aged&#146;, and at Moreton he erected school buildings for children and an infants' school with house for its mistress. He provided also means for securing medical aid for the poor of these districts. The whole diocese of Gloucester received large sums from him for similar purposes, and he gave numerous benefactions to the colonial sees of Sydney and Nova Scotia.<br>
<br>Warneford founded in 1832 the Warneford, Leamington, and South Warwickshire Hospital at Leamington, and left it at his death the sum of &pound;10,000. His benefactions towards the cost of new buildings at the Queen's Hospital at Birmingham, and for endowments including chaplaincies, a professorship of pastoral theology, and scholarships at the Queen's College, represented a total of &pound;25,000. He there became &#145;the real ruler of the college&#146;  (Beckwith, 43), but became discouraged at its lack of progress and did not leave it the large benefaction for which it hoped. On King's College, London, he bestowed large sums for the foundation of medical scholarships and for establishing prizes for the encouragement of theology among the matriculated medical students. He gave the site of a new boys' school to the Clergy Orphan School near Canterbury, and at his death he left that institution the sum of &pound;13,000. He also contributed large sums, during his life and at his death, to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and the Corporation for the Sons of the Clergy. The total of such gifts is said to have equalled &pound;200,000; in fulfilment of his intentions his niece, Lady Wetherell-Warneford, bequeathed &pound;30,000, the income of which was to be applied in building churches and parsonage-houses in poor districts within the ancient diocese of Gloucester, and &pound;45,000, the accruing interest of which was to be expended for the benefit of the widows and orphans of the poor clergy in the same district. His sister Philadelphia, a wealthy woman in her own right, contributed to many of the charities he supported. Warneford's correspondence with Joshua Watson on charities began in 1837  (Churton, 2.59, 313).<br>
<br>Warneford died at the rectory, Bourton, on 11 January 1855, in his ninety-second year, preserving his faculties to the last. On 17 January he was buried under a tomb in the church. Warneford, though strict, was not ostentatious. After his death it was noted in Leamington Spa: &#145;Little is now remembered of the good man except his yearly visits to partake of the Waters, and of the extent of his benefactions, few, besides the Committee of the period, were aware&#146;  (Beckwith, 52).<br>
