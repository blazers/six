<span class="headword">Fenn,  John</span>  (1535&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and translator</span>, was born at Montacute in Somerset. He was brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9281/', "James Fenn")</script> and Robert Fenn, who both also became priests. After a time as a chorister at Wells Cathedral he was sent to Winchester College in 1547 and went on to become a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1550, where he studied civil law. In the reign of Queen Mary he was appointed master of the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds where he established a great reputation for himself, but at the accession of Elizabeth he was ejected from the post for his religious beliefs. In 1562 he was also deprived of his New College fellowship for the same reasons and sought refuge in Flanders. He matriculated at the University of Louvain on 28 March 1564 and was still listed as a student there in 1570. He is listed as a priest by 1574.<br>
<br>Fenn's deep knowledge of Latin resulted in a number of translations of contemporary works into English, beginning in 1568 with <span class="italic">A Learned and Very Eloquent Treatie, Written in Latin</span>, a translation of Bishop Osorius's treatise against Walter Haddon. In this and later translations of works on the rosary and the life of St Catherine of Siena he &#145;transforms his original into something which is purely English&#146;  (Southern, 122). Fenn also translated works of John Fisher into Latin and the catechism of the Council of Trent into English. Once a priest he became chaplain to Sir William Stanley's regiment, which was fighting for the Spanish in the Netherlands. In 1583 he co-edited, with the Jesuit John Gibbons, <span class="italic">Concertatio ecclesiae catholicae in Anglia</span>, an important book that stressed &#145;the use of torture and other forms of cruelty on the Catholic priests by the English authorities&#146;  (Milward, 68). This brought about an angry reaction from the English authorities and prompted Lord Burghley to publish an official reply.<br>
<br>Fenn was recorded in 1601 as being resident as chaplain at the monastery of St Ursula, a house of canonesses at Louvain, but in 1609 he was appointed chaplain to the sisters of St Monica's, a newly founded house of English Augustinian canonesses in the same city. There he remained until his death. He was fully involved in the life of the monastery, and indeed lent it a large amount of money that it was unable to repay, but from which he released the canonesses. The sisters provided him with a room which he used to accommodate his large library. His time as chaplain also provided him with an opportunity to use his childhood musical gifts and he taught the sisters singing. He died on the feast of St John the Evangelist, his patron, 27 December 1615; &#145;having been a long time blind and decrepit, he lived a true sincere man one of the old stamp, and served God faithfully&#146;  (Hamilton, 1.39). He left the sisters all his possessions, including his library, and was buried in the cloister of the monastery.<br>
