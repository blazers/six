<span class="headword">Selwyn,  Victor</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">journalist and literary editor</span>, was born Victor Solomin at 19 Northcote Road, Battersea, London, on 11 January 1917, one of five children of Leon Solomin, later Selwyn, fur trader, and his wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Melnick. His parents had emigrated from Lithuania. Educated in London, he graduated BSc from the London School of Economics shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>During the war Selwyn served in the Surrey regiment in north Africa and Italy as a navigation officer. But it was in Cairo in 1942 that he found his mission in life when, in Music for All, a meeting place for servicemen, he and two other men, David Burk and Denis Saunders&#151;none of them with a higher rank than corporal&#151;wondered why there seemed to be no poetry about the Second World War as there was about the First. Within four months, with the help of General Sir Henry Maitland (Jumbo) Wilson, the commander-in-chief in the Middle East, they appealed in newspapers and on the radio for poetry from men serving in the region. More than 3000 poems from 800 would-be contributors arrived, and a substantial selection was published under the title of <span class="italic">Oasis</span> by Salamander Productions in Cairo in 1943.<br>
<br>When he returned from the war Selwyn worked for a time as a market-research statistician. On 20 October 1946, at the synagogue in Singers Hill, Birmingham, he married Irene Rebecca Cohen, the 26-year-old daughter of Philip Cohen, tailor. They had two daughters, Trixie (<i>b</i>. 1949) and Louise (<i>b</i>. 1957). Selwyn's interest in writing eventually led to a successful career as a freelance journalist, and he wrote on a wide variety of subjects&#151;including athletics, economics, and medical topics&#151;for such newspapers as the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He also published several books, <span class="italic">Investment Guide Western Europe</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Guide to National Practices in Western Europe</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Plan your Route: the New Approach to Map Reading</span> (1987). In 1955 the family moved from Acton to Hove and then in 1960 to 7 Lenham Avenue, Saltdean, where they remained until his death.<br>
<br>During the 1970s the idea of collecting and publishing the poetry of the Second World War was revived. Selwyn and several of the original Cairo poets established the Salamander Oasis Trust in 1976, and advertised for poetry from British servicemen everywhere. This appeal attracted thousands of poems and related items, and Selwyn and the trust began to seek publication. The first post-war anthology, <span class="italic">Return to Oasis: War Poems and Recollections from the Middle East, 1940&#150;1946</span>, was published with an introduction by Lawrence Durrell in 1980. It was followed in 1983 by <span class="italic">From Oasis into Italy: War Poems and Diaries from Africa and Italy 1940&#150;1946</span>, with a preface by Field Marshal Lord Carver. Both books were published by Shepheard-Walwyn. As more wartime writing was discovered, J. M. Dent published <span class="italic">Poems of the Second World War: the Oasis Selection</span> in 1985 and <span class="italic">More Poems of the Second World War: the Oasis Selection</span> in 1989. An anthology, especially edited (with Dennis Butts) for schoolchildren, <span class="italic">Schools Oasis: Poems of the Second World War</span>, was published by Nelson in 1992, and, fifty years after the end of the war in Europe, Penguin published <span class="italic">The Voice of War: Poems of the Second World War, the Oasis Collection</span> in 1995. Selwyn edited or co-edited all these works.<br>
<br>The Salamander Oasis Trust gradually expanded its interest during these years, trying to find, preserve, and, where possible, publish the poetry and diaries from all theatres of the war by men and women from the Commonwealth as well as Britain, including the famous, such as Keith Douglas's &#145;Elegy for an 88 Gunner&#146; (&#145;<i>Vergissmeinicht</i>&#146;), as well as Elsie Cawser's less well-known comic &#145;Salvage Song&#146; and the anonymous ballad &#145;The D-Day Dodgers&#146;. There were poems about Dunkirk, Arnhem, and Belsen but also about air-raids, monotonous food, and missing letters. This was the stuff of a people's war. Selwyn, who eventually became editor-in-chief of the Salamander Oasis Trust, defined the character of its publications in his introduction to the <span class="italic">Schools Oasis</span>:<blockquote>In contrast to many anthologies, the <span class="italic">Oasis</span> series includes only poems by those serving in World War Two and written at the time. This gives the poems their immediacy. Poems, especially from the unknowns, smell of war, an authenticity ensured by the compilers having also been participants in that War, both serving and writing. That is how it was. We were there.</blockquote>Apart from helping to collect and edit the material, Selwyn laboured tirelessly on behalf of the trust. Money had to be raised somehow, from charities and private donations, and often by public readings and the sale of books and audio-tapes. Hundreds of letters had to be written and numerous phone-calls made. Selwyn called upon the support of former servicemen, including Ian Fletcher, Denis Healey, and Spike Milligan, and was also able to persuade gifted performers, like Dirk Bogarde, Barry Humphries, and Martin Jarvis, to help with public performances.<br>
<br>Selwyn's energy and (often stubborn) determination undoubtedly made him the driving force behind the Salamander Oasis Trust and all its works. He remained indefatigable, despite numerous ailments, and successfully resisted throat cancer in his later years. The trust lodged more than 17,000 poems and related documents in the Imperial War Museum, and thus made an invaluable contribution to an understanding of the Second World War. Selwyn was appointed MBE in 1996 in recognition of his contribution to Second World War literature. He died of aspiration pneumonia at Ireland Lodge, Lockwood Crescent, Brighton, on 26 October 2005, and his body was cremated at Woodvale crematorium, Brighton, on 4 November. He was survived by his wife and their two daughters. A memorial poetry reading held at the Imperial War Museum on 7 December ended with a spirited rendition of &#145;The D-Day Dodgers&#146;, led by Lord Healey.<br>
