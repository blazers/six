<span class="headword">Holyday <span class="st"> [Holiday]</span>,  Barten</span>  (1593&#150;1661), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born in the parish of All Saints, Oxford, the son of Thomas Holiday, a tailor. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, before going to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1605, perhaps as a chorister, matriculating on 13 December. He graduated BA on 14 May 1612 and proceeded MA on 15 June 1615, already being recognized as a gifted orator and poet. He was ordained and given two benefices in Oxford diocese. In 1616 he published his well-received verse translation of Persius's <span class="italic">Satires</span>, noted for its smoothness; by 1650 it had reached its fifth edition. From 1617 to 1621 he served as praelector in rhetoric and philosophy and, while a student of Christ Church, he produced <span class="italic">Technogamia, or, The Marriages of the Arts</span>, which was acted in the hall on 13 February 1617 and published in 1618. It was intended to be a comedy in which characters representing the range of studies in the university argue for their positions, but the wordy laboured speeches included allusions that were not always grasped by the audience.<br>
<br>In 1618 Holyday made a more favourable impression when he went to Spain as chaplain to Sir Francis Stewart, who accompanied Count Gondomar on his return home after many years as ambassador. Three years later, on 26 August 1621, <span class="italic">Technogamia</span> was performed before James I at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, but the king was not impressed. He found it tedious and had to be persuaded to stay to the end. Some epigrams on the Woodstock performance were circulated by Cambridge wits, and Holyday's Oxford friends, including Henry King, later bishop of Chichester, had to come to his support.<br>
<br>In 1623 Holyday became vicar of Ashleworth, Gloucestershire, and Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, and in 1625 archdeacon of Oxford. Sermons preached at Paul's Cross on 5 August 1623 and 24 March 1625 and three sermons delivered in Oxford on the passion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ were published in 1626. These were the first of many that appeared in his lifetime, their subjects ranging from examinations of texts taken from the <span class="roman">Old and New Testaments</span> to considerations of motives for a godly life and the nature of faith. On 14 August 1628 Holyday married Elizabeth Wickham at Garsington, Oxfordshire; they had three sons and two daughters. In 1633 his <span class="italic">Philosophiae polito-barbarae specimen</span>, a Latin tractate, was published, and he continued to write verse, typical being his commendatory verses prefixed to the 1640 edition of Jonson's poems and his comic epitaph on the death of the proctor Edward Wood in 1655. By 1638 he was rector of Emmington, with Iffley and Littlemore, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Holyday remained in Oxford when it became the royalist headquarters in the autumn of 1642, and it was probably about this time that he became a chaplain to the king. On 1 November he was created DD by royal command. According to his later account, he was sequestered in 1646; on 17 June 1647 the committee for plundered ministers referred articles against him to the committee for compounding. He apparently remained in Oxfordshire, and on 9 August 1649, as a widower, married at Radley, just over the border in Berkshire, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sheppard (<i>d</i>. 1661), widow of Francis Dewey, minister of Chippenham, Wiltshire; they had a son, Barten, and a daughter. By 1652 Holyday was curate of Iffley, and on 31 October 1655 he was admitted to the rectory of Chilton, Berkshire. Continuing his writing, he published an edition of Horace in 1652, <span class="italic">Of the Nature of Faith</span> (1654), and <span class="italic">Motives to a Good Life</span> (1657).<br>
<br>In 1660 Holyday returned to Oxford and the position of archdeacon, living in Iffley. He might well have become a bishop had he not been thought to have had too great a sense of his own importance. In 1661 his <span class="italic">Survey of the World</span>, a substantial poetic work in ten books, possibly drafted earlier in his life, was published in Oxford. In his preface and elsewhere, taking an overview of the world and using iambic pentameter couplets, Holyday reveals an alertness to the beauty of a landscape through the combination of nature and art. He died at Iffley on 2 October 1661 and was buried three days later in Christ Church, Oxford. His widow survived him for only a few weeks, dying on 16 December.<br>
