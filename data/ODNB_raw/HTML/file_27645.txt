<span class="headword">Toy,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1537, <em>d.</em> 1577), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was the son of the London bookseller <a name="cosubject_27645"></a><span class="headword">Robert Toy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1556)<span class="occ"></span> and his first wife (<i>d</i>. in or before 1546); the couple also had a daughter, Rose, who married the London stationer Arthur Pepwell (<i>d</i>. 1568/9). The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> suggested that Robert was originally Welsh&#151;a speculation supported by the bequest by Robert's second wife to another Robert, &#145;the son of Humfrie Toye of Carmarthen&#146;, in 1565 and Humphrey's activities as a publisher of Welsh works  (Plomer, 15). Robert was probably freed by the Stationers' Company before 1537 and was assessed at &pound;20 in St Faith's parish, London, in 1541. He was publishing from premises in St Paul's Churchyard probably from 1542 onwards; from 1545 he was operating under the sign of the Bell. On 22 January 1546 he married Elizabeth Scampion (<i>d</i>. 1565) of St Margaret's, Westminster. <span class="italic">STC</span> associates him with the publication of more than forty titles, mostly religious and theological, including two works by Stephen Gardiner, one title by Foxe, and, in 1551, an edition of the Matthew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He also co-published Chaucer's works and two Skelton texts, <span class="italic">Phyllyp Sparowe</span> and <span class="italic">Why Come ye Nat to Courte</span>.<br>
<br>Robert's son Humphrey matriculated as a sizar from Queens' College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1551, but there is no record of his obtaining a degree. Robert died between 5 February 1556, the date of his will, and 12 February, when Elizabeth rewarded the Stationers' Company for &#145;commynge to the buryall of hyr husbonde&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.35). At his death Robert had property interests throughout St Paul's Churchyard and the nearby Paternoster Row, and left his shop to Elizabeth, his executor, with a reversion to Humphrey upon her death. Other bequests included the Stationers' Company and the poor of the parish of Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, where Robert's brother Edward Toy (or Troy) had been vicar since 1551. Elizabeth carried on the bookselling business until at least 1558, most notably entering more than thirty ballad titles with John Walley in the company's register.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1558 Humphrey, who then must have been at least twenty-one, was freed by patrimony into the Stationers' Company. He entered his first work in the company's registers in August 1560, and was admitted to the livery in summer 1561. He served as a renter warden of the company for successive years for 1561&#150;2 and 1562&#150;3, and was living at his shop at the sign of the Helmet in St Paul's Churchyard (probably opposite the great north door of the cathedral) from 1562 until 1574. In 1564 he brought an action in chancery against Robert Leche, chancellor of West Chester, over money owed for copies of the second book of <span class="italic">Homilies</span>. Toy's stepmother died in 1565, leaving him most of her estate. Humphrey was evidently married by this time, as Elizabeth's will named Elizabeth and Joan as his children. He was married to Margaret or Margery (<i>d</i>. after 1577), daughter of James Revell, surveyor of the works, but neither the date of marriage nor whether she was the mother of these children is known. Toy rose further in the Stationers' Company, serving as under-warden for two terms between 1571 and 1573. In the summer of 1575 he was involved, with three other members of the book trade, in a dispute with the queen's printer, Richard Jugge, over the right to print bibles.<br>
<br>Only about thirty works bearing Toy's imprint survive, including an edition of Grafton's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. Toy was a &#145;deare Friend&#146; of the Welsh scholar William Salesbury, and in 1567 he published Salesbury's translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> as well as his guide to Welsh pronunciation  (Salesbury, sig. A2<i>r</i>). Toy's business also had an important international dimension. Between at least 1566 and 1569 he had links with the printer Christopher Plantin in Antwerp: during the first half of 1568, for example, he received thirty-five reams of books from Antwerp, while a surviving list of 159 books sent to him by Plantin, apparently just after Toy's death, showed that he was using Plantin as an agent to purchase protestant works from across Europe.<br>
<br>Toy may have had Bristol connections as, following his death on 16 October 1577, he was buried in All Saints' Church in that city, where his widow set up a funeral monument. The administration of his estate was granted to Margaret on 26 November and his shop passed to his former apprentice, Thomas Chard. Toy is to be distinguished from a contemporary namesake in the Merchant Taylors' Company who was active in 1583.<br>
