<span class="headword">Power, Sir  Manley</span>  (1773&#150;1826), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Hill Court, near Ross, Herefordshire, the son of Thomas Bolton Power (1735&#150;1801), captain in the 20th regiment, of Hill Court, and his wife, Ann Corney, daughter of Captain Corney. His great-grandparents were John Power (<i>d</i>. 1712) and Mercy Manley, daughter of Thomas Manley, of Erbistock, Denbighshire. Manley's first commission as ensign in the 20th foot was dated 27 August 1783, when apparently he was between nine and ten years old. He was promoted lieutenant in 1789 and captain of an independent company in 1793. After his transfer to the 20th foot on 16 January 1794, he was promoted major in 1799 and lieutenant-colonel in 1801.<br>
<br>Power saw much active service. After two years (1795&#150;7) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he served with the unsuccessful expedition to the Netherlands in 1799 and went to Minorca in 1800. In 1801 his regiment joined the force in Egypt commanded by Sir Ralph Abercromby. He was present at the siege and French surrender (31 August 1801) at Alexandria. On 25 October 1802 he was placed on half pay but from 1803 to 1805 he acted as assistant adjutant-general at the Horse Guards, London. On 6 June 1805 he was made lieutenant-colonel of the 32nd foot, and became colonel in the army in 1810. He took part in the Peninsular War, serving with the duke of Wellington's army in Spain. He was ordered to return for assignment in England, but owing to his experience in commanding Portuguese troops, he was re-assigned to a Portuguese brigade under Lieutenant-General William Carr Beresford. He commanded such a brigade at Salamanca and later at Vittoria, Nivelle, and Orthes. In June 1813 he was promoted major-general. He was awarded a cross and clasp and was made knight-commander of the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword and made KCB (2 January 1815). Later he served on the staff in Canada and was lieutenant-governor of Malta.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1802 Power married Sarah, daughter of J. Coulson, and they had three daughters and a son, Manley (1803&#150;1857), who became a lieutenant-colonel commanding the 85th regiment. In 1818 he married, second, Anne, daughter of Kingsmill Evans, colonel in the Grenadier Guards, of Lydiart House, Monmouthshire, and they had two sons. Their eldest son, Kingsmill Manley Power (1819&#150;1881), was captain in the 9th and 16th lancers and served with distinction in the Gwalior and Sutlej campaigns. He was promoted lieutenant-general in May 1825. Power died at Bern, Switzerland, on 7 July 1826.<br>
