<span class="headword">Heywood,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1677), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, fourth son of Richard Heywood (1595/6&#150;1677) of Little Lever, near Bolton, Lancashire, and his first wife, Alice Critchlaw (<i>c</i>.1593&#150;1657), was born at Little Lever and baptized at Bolton parish church on 16 September 1633. Heywood's father was a fustian weaver who subsequently became a landowner in Bolton with mining and milling interests. Nathaniel's parents were strongly puritan, and another presbyterian minister, the diarist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13186/', "Oliver Heywood")</script>, was one of his elder brothers.<br>
<br>From school at Horwich he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, entering in May 1648 and graduating BA in 1652. He was brought to a spiritual commitment under the preaching of Samuel Hammond. He spent some time in London before he went to study for two years under Edward Gee, rector of Eccleston, Lancashire. There he met and married Elizabeth Parr, a relative of Richard Parr, bishop of Sodor and Man, and Gee's predecessor. They had nine children, and she outlived him.<br>
<br>Heywood was called to Illingworth Chapel, Halifax parish, where he suffered many hardships and setbacks, having &#145;not sought the peace of the place, but the good of it&#146;  (Ashurst, 7&#150;8). He received a call from Ormskirk, Lancashire, and in January 1656 the classis met in Wigan to hear the petitions of parishioners from Ormskirk and Illingworth, finding in favour of Ormskirk. Heywood was presented to the vicarage on 7 August 1656 by the countess of Derby, installed by the fifth classis of Lancashire, and approved by the parliamentary commissioners. His ministry was active and successful. A royalist in politics, he welcomed the Restoration with a sermon on thanksgiving day (10 May 1660), taking an odd text (<span class="roman">2 Samuel</span> 19: 30). He was urged by the local gentry to print it but refused. Heywood was ejected from the living by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> but continued to preach in the church until a Mr Ashworth, a local teacher, was installed. Heywood's biographer commented that the new vicar was non-resident and that &#145;Mr. Heywood still seemed to have the sole charge of that Town and parish&#146;, as well as preaching in Wigan, Warrington, Liverpool, Preston, and Eccleston  (Ashurst, 14).<br>
<br>On the declaration of indulgence of 1672 Heywood was licensed as a presbyterian to minister at the chapel at Bickerstaff &#145;adjoining Lady Stanley's house&#146; and one at Scarisbrick. To protect him from the effects of the annulment of the indulgence in 1673, Lady Stanley had the service of common prayer read before his sermon. His fiercely anti-Catholic sermons enraged local Catholics and may have had something to do with the ferocity of the persecution he experienced: in the first four months of 1674 he had thirty-four warrants presented against him. Later in the year he recorded that meetings could still be held in both chapels, though the congregation &#145;met in fear&#146;. In late December 1674 he was taken by soldiers at Bickerstaff, despite Lady Stanley's personal attempt to intervene. He was tendered the Oxford oath by the JPs and given until the next quarter sessions at Wigan to consider his response, when the oath would be put to him again. Although he was supported by Lady Stanley and Henry Houghton in Wigan, what saved him was the affection of the people of Ormskirk. The <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> could not be applied because no one could be found to swear that he lived in Ormskirk.<br>
<br>Heywood died at Ormskirk on Sunday 16 December 1677. It was a measure of the respect and affection in which he was held that his funeral sermon was preached by the ejected nonconformist John Starkie in Ormskirk parish church, &#145;no man forbidding him; nay all that were any way concerned consenting&#146;. He was buried on Wednesday 19 December in the vault of the Stanleys of Bickerstaff in the chancel of Ormskirk church. His elder brother Oliver Heywood described him as &#145;the flower of our family for learning, parts, piety, singularly beloved of God and man, sorely afflicted, seasonably delivered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rev. Oliver Heywood</span>, 1.38). Heywood's biographer, usually taken to be Sir Henry Ashurst, but perhaps Oliver, emphasized Nathaniel's allegiance to the presbyterian party: &#145;he was (according to his Education) a strict Presbyterian&#146;, avoiding the extremes of prelacy and congregationalist democracy  (Ashurst, 71). &#145;He loved and used sound speech that cannot be condemned, as well as sound and orthodox Truth: standing at an equal distance from Arminians on the one hand, and Antinomians on the other&#146;  (ibid., 90&#150;91). Heywood published nothing but after his death two of his sermons were printed, with the title <span class="italic">Christ Displayed</span> (1679).<br>
<br>The younger <a name="cosubject_13185"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Heywood</span>  (1659&#150;1704), Heywood's eldest son, <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 6 June 1659 and baptized at Ormskirk eight days later. He entered Richard Frankland's academy on 25 April 1677 and graduated MA from Edinburgh University in 1680. He then studied with his uncle Oliver, becoming a chaplain to a Mr Dickins in Staffordshire in 1683&#150;4. He was ordained at Attercliff, Yorkshire, on 1 June 1687, by Oliver Heywood and Richard Frankland, and probably succeeded in his father's ministry about this time. He suffered from melancholia and experienced lengthy illnesses, which prevented him from preaching. At the Lancashire quarter sessions held at Ormskirk on 22 July 1689 he registered &#145;Bury's House nr Ormeske &hellip; for a pl. of meeting for him the sd Nathanial Heywood &amp; his Congregation&#146;  (Register of dissenting meeting-houses, 1689, Lancs. RO, QDV 4). He is probably the Mr Heywood mentioned in the United Brethren minutes for the meeting held at Manchester on 4 September 1694.<br>
<br>Heywood was married three times. His first wife, Isabel Lynford of Brinscall, near Blackburn, died in childbirth in January 1688. From the son whom she died giving birth to, Benjamin Heywood of Drogheda, descended Sir Benjamin Heywood and the Heywood banking family of Liverpool, Manchester, and Wakefield. Nathaniel then married Rebecca Angier of Warrington, a marriage pointing to ties of kinship within the nonconformist ministry. Nathaniel's uncle Oliver had married the daughter of the puritan clergyman John Angier, whose nephew and grandson, both named Samuel, were ministers at Dukinfield near Manchester and Toxteth Park Chapel near Liverpool respectively. Rebecca's place within the family is unclear, but &#145;S. A.&#146; (almost certainly the latter Samuel) baptized the son born to her and Nathaniel in April 1695. Nathaniel, his uncle recorded, &#145;greatly rejoyced in having a living wife and son Nathl. Lord's Day after left her well, preacht; in afternoon sent for out of chapel after he had been half an hour, ran fast, found her dead, April, 1695&#146;  (Turner, 64). Heywood's third marriage, the licence for which was dated 24 May 1699, was to Mary Trueman of Liverpool. He died on 26 October 1704 and was buried at Ormskirk two days later. Administration of the will was granted to his widow on 12 May 1711.<br>
