<span class="headword">Bentley,  Phyllis Eleanor</span>  (1894&#150;1977), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 19 November 1894 at Victoria House, Stanley Road, Halifax, Yorkshire, the fourth child and only daughter of Joseph Edwin Bentley (1855&#150;1926), master dyer and finisher, and his wife, Eleanor Kettlewell (1859&#150;1949), daughter of Thomas Kettlewell, representative of a cloth-manufacturing firm in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. She was educated at the Princess Mary High School for Girls, Halifax, and, from 1910, at Cheltenham Ladies' College, where she studied for an external London University degree. In 1914 she was awarded a first-class pass degree, an indication that she should have taken the honours degree that was at that time forbidden to women students.<br>
<br>After her years at Cheltenham, Bentley returned to Halifax. Her autobiography <span class="italic">&#145;O Dreams, O Destinations&#146;</span> (1962) recalls the dilemma of the educated woman living in the parental home without income or independence in the early years of the twentieth century. She came under strong pressure to &#145;stay out of a man's job&#146; and help her mother with domestic tasks, but in 1915 she took a teaching post in a boys' grammar school. She was an unsuccessful schoolteacher, in particular unable to keep order, and after six months of misery returned home. After an unsettled period of two years she became a volunteer at a new, progressive child welfare clinic in Halifax, and her work with working-class women and their children awakened her political conscience. She combined volunteer work with a rigorous programme of reading and self-education, and her political and religious convictions gradually shifted from Conservative and Church of England to socialist and humanist.<br>
<br>In 1918 Bentley moved to London to work as a munitions clerk. After the war she returned to Halifax with a strong sense of herself as a &#145;surplus woman&#146;, both personally and professionally. Convinced from an early age that she was unattractive to men, she was inhibited by shyness and had never considered marriage an option. Instead, she determined to &#145;reform injustice, banish iniquities, dismiss hate &hellip; by presenting human character in story&#146;  (Bentley, 107). A librarian friend taught her the Dewey decimal system, and she spent the next six years cataloguing books in local libraries while working on a novel in the evenings. In 1922 <span class="italic">Environment</span> was published. Set in her native West Riding of Yorkshire, it was the first of many novels in which she saw her own district as a microcosm of the world and expressed her strong belief that only through understanding and conciliation could troubles be cured. Partly autobiographical, its story was that of a young woman struggling for education and fulfilment in the fictional Yorkshire town of Hudley. It was damned with faint praise by reviewers, but, undeterred by lukewarm notices, she slowly mastered the techniques of crafting fiction. Over the next three years she managed to save &pound;700 from the modest sales of <span class="italic">Environment</span>, subsequent short stories, and contributions to the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. In 1926, during the general strike, the family textiles business foundered, but, by giving up her savings, she managed to keep it afloat. Her father died from a heart attack in 1926, which Bentley attributed to the stress of impending bankruptcy, and from then on she had the responsibility of supporting her widowed mother, who lived to be ninety. In 1929 <span class="italic">Carr</span> was published, the imaginary biography of Philip Joseph Carr, a west Yorkshire manufacturer, written by his granddaughter. This novel was more favourably received by the critics: the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> commended her for overcoming the difficulties of the fictional biography. It was Bentley's first experiment with historical regional fiction, and two years later she achieved her great success with <span class="italic">Inheritance</span> (1932), a chronicle of the Oldroyd family and their mill from the time of the Luddites to the closing of the mill in 1930. The sequels <span class="italic">The Rise of Henry Morcar</span> (1946), <span class="italic">A Man of his Time</span> (1966), and <span class="italic">Ring in the New</span> (1969) carried the chronicle of the Oldroyds up to 1968. The entire series became a television serial. These novels and all her subsequent ones were published by Victor Gollancz.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Inheritance</span> brought Bentley to prominence both in Britain and in the United States. During the early 1930s she was befriended by Winifred Holtby and Vera Brittain, both of whom invited her to London and introduced her into literary circles. In 1934, 1936, 1939, and 1941 she visited the United States on lecture tours, on which she was promoted as a regional novelist. Her only novel set outside Yorkshire, <span class="italic">Freedom's Farewell</span> (1936), about the fall of the Roman empire and written as a protest against the rise of Hitler and Mussolini, was not a success. In 1941 she published <span class="italic">The English Regional Novel</span>, a survey of regional fiction from 1840 to 1940, with special emphasis on Charlotte Bront&euml;, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, and Arnold Bennett. In January 1941 Bentley braved London in the blitz to work there for the American division of the British Ministry of Information, taking a small flat in Bloomsbury. The position was an acknowledgement of her fame in the United States, and in 1944 she crossed the Atlantic on government business, risking the perils of submarines, to work with the British information service in New York. From 1945 until 1949 her time was occupied with nursing her invalid mother, and she was unable to write. After her mother's death in 1949, she worked prodigiously, producing volumes of short stories, her autobiography in 1962, several historical children's books, a short biography, <span class="italic">The Bront&euml;s</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Bront&euml;s and their World</span> (1969), and detective stories for American magazines. She also contributed many reviews and articles to various journals, for years writing a fortnightly column of fiction reviews in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. She was also a vigorous supporter of local arts activities, particularly amateur dramatics, and was active on many committees.<br>
<br>During the fifties Bentley became aware that her popularity was on the wane, as, with the arrival of the Angry Young Men on the literary scene, the working class was replacing the middle class as the material for novels. Her later fiction, such as <span class="italic">Crescendo</span> (1958), did not enjoy the success of her <span class="roman">Oldroyd</span> series. However, in later life she achieved recognition as an accomplished writer. Leeds University awarded her an honorary DLitt in 1949, in 1958 she became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and she was appointed OBE in 1970. She died at her home, Ing Royde, Broomfield Avenue, Halifax, on 27 June 1977.<br>
