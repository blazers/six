<span class="headword">Soulis, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1310), <span class="occ">administrator and guardian of Scotland</span>, was the second son of Nicholas de Soulis, lord of Liddesdale and butler of Scotland, and younger brother of William, justiciar of Lothian, who died <i>c</i>.1292&#150;3. John appears from about 1280 in the shadow of his elder brother, but from 1284, by then a knight, as a royal servant on the embassy which arranged the marriage of Yolande de Dreux to Alexander III; by 1289, and perhaps before 1286, he was sheriff of Berwick, and he was among the magnates present in negotiations at Birgham in 1290. In the Great Cause he and William were auditors nominated by Robert (V) de Brus (though William's son, Nicholas, was a claimant). John is found in the two records of King John's parliaments of 1293, including acting as surety for the young Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, and in 1295 was one of two magnates sent by the government which had taken power from King John to make an alliance with France. He is not named in the Ragman rolls among those submitting to Edward I in 1296, and the charter which he is said to witness at this time is an undated but earlier private charter contained in a royal <i>inspeximus</i> of 1296. There is no trace of him in Scotland or England from 1295, and he seems to have been in France for some five years. He received payments from Philippe IV in February and May 1299 and was reported to be at Damme in July 1299, awaiting passage to Scotland, just at the time when King John had been released from English into papal custody.<br>
<br>It has been assumed that Soulis returned to Scotland in 1299, but there is no evidence to that effect, and it is more probable that he was left behind by the other ambassadors because the Scottish king could now be contacted, and that he eventually spent time with the king. Fordun states that during the time of John Comyn's guardianship, that is, from 1298, Soulis was associated in office with him by King John, who was then freed from prison and living at Bailleul; King John was released by the pope into French custody some time after September 1300, and was sent to Bailleul at a date which seems to have been late in the summer of 1301. Despite Fordun, the timetable is such that the king must have appointed Soulis guardian before his release to the French and before going to Bailleul, for Soulis is found acting as sole guardian in Scotland in May 1301. He took the remarkable step of issuing charters and other acts in the name of King John, and responded decisively to the evasive arguments deployed at the papal court by Edward I by holding a council and sending two proctors to join Baldred Bisset at the curia with a dossier of cogent counter-arguments.<br>
<br>The war of deeds was less effective than the war of words, though in the summer of 1301 Soulis and Ingram Umfraville successfully harassed the prince of Wales in the south-west, attacking the stronghold of Lochmaben on 7&#150;8 September 1301 and then mustering at Loudoun in the vain hope of relieving Bothwell Castle, besieged by Edward I. Nevertheless Edward achieved so little that in January 1302 he agreed to a nine-month truce. All now depended upon the involvement of Edward I in France, or on an Anglo-French peace which incorporated Scotland, and in the autumn of 1302 Soulis went again to France with a powerful embassy to try to hold Philippe IV to the Scots' cause. In 1303 they wrote home with a mixture of despair and hope, but the despair alone was justified: Philippe deserted the Scots, and in February 1304 their leaders decided to sue for peace. Soulis, punished with just two years of exile, could have been included, but would have none of it. He remained in France until his death at an unknown date before 1310. He married Margaret, daughter of Merleswain, lord of Ardross in Fife, and widow of Hugh de Perisby, probably before 1295; they had a daughter, Muriella. Fordun had no high opinion of Soulis, but he should be judged as a politician, or statesman, not a commander. For a man of small resources and minor standing he clearly impressed his social betters with his diplomatic skills.<br>
<br>His nephew, Nicholas de Soulis, lord of Liddesdale, died at the end of 1296, leaving two sons from his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan. The elder, <a name="cosubject_54324"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Soulis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1320/21)<span class="occ"></span>, was probably sympathetic to the patriotic cause, but still young when received to Edward I's peace in 1304. He was knighted by 1312. From 1306 he served in the English interest, and was rewarded in 1312 with the lands of Sir Robert Keith, but after Bannockburn and the threat of forfeiture he adhered to Robert I. It was probably he, not John as the Lanercost chronicle says, who accompanied Edward Bruce and James Douglas in a great raid into northern England in August 1314, for William had a grant of Wark in Tynedale from King Robert before 1315. Yet not until the very end of 1319 does he appear in a royal act, being sent as negotiator of the truce made in December of that year. Early in 1320, as a witness to a royal charter, he is described as butler of Scotland, and he also has that designation in the declaration of Arbroath on 6 May 1320.<br>
<br>Within weeks Soulis was discovered to be involved in a plot against the king, along with others formerly associated with the Balliol camp. According to Barbour, Soulis had 360 esquires in his livery, as well as knights, at Berwick, suggesting that he had recruited a gang of men-at-arms there. When arrested and brought before parliament in August 1320, he confessed and was sent to Dumbarton Castle for life imprisonment. Barbour's claim that the conspirators meant to make Soulis king is to be discounted as an attempt to explain an episode for which his source gave no explanation. The aim may have been to replace Robert I by Edward Balliol, but not to restore English lordship. It is also likely that Barbour has exaggerated Soulis's part and diminished the importance in the conspiracy of Sir David Brechin, who was executed. Each was the son of a daughter of Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan. Soulis had died by 20 April 1321. He and his wife, whose name is unknown, had two daughters and possibly a son, the man of the same name killed at Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322, according to the Lanercost chronicle.<br>
<br>Sir William's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_26045"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Soulis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1318)<span class="occ"></span>, emerged from obscurity in November 1314 when, already a knight, he came from France to ransom kinsmen taken prisoner at Bannockburn. He gave allegiance to King Robert and in the following year joined Edward Bruce on the Irish adventure, a typical landless younger son seeking endowment in this risky business. He was back in Scotland when Sir Andrew Harclay invaded Eskdale from Carlisle in 1316 and was routed and taken prisoner by a small force under Sir John, an exploit famous in ballad in the fourteenth century. By 1318 Soulis had returned to Ireland, where he took part in the last campaign of Edward Bruce and was killed with him in a foolish battle at Faughart, near Dundalk, on 14 October 1318. He had no known children.<br>
