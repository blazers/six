<span class="headword">Collier,  Mary</span>  (1688?&#150;1762), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born near Midhurst, Sussex. There is disagreement about her parents and her date of birth, but &#145;She is probably the Mary, daughter of William Collyer&#146; baptized in Lodsworth, Sussex, on 9 October 1688  (Klaus, 202).<br>
<br>Information about Collier's life is mostly drawn from &#145;Some remarks on the author's life drawn by herself&#146;, prefaced to her <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1762). She describes the education she received from her parents, &#145;by whom I was taught to read when very Young&#146;. On the early death of her mother she did not attend school but was &#145;set to such labour as the country afforded&#146;  (Collier, iii).<br>
<br>Collier lived with her father, &#145;who was long sickly and infirm&#146; until his death in the 1720s, when she moved to Petersfield, earning a modest living by washing, brewing, and other manual labour. Nevertheless she kept up her reading, and at some time after 1730 she came to know the work of the thresher-poet Stephen Duck. His poem <span class="italic">The Thresher's Labour</span>, which Mary Collier read and &#145;soon got by heart&#146;, provoked her by his charge that rural women had an easier life than men. Her riposte, entitled <span class="italic">The Woman's Labour: an Epistle to Mr Stephen Duck</span>, was intended &#145;to call an Army of Amazons to vindicate the injured sex&#146;  (Collier, iv).<br>
<br>Collier did not originally intend publication, but after she repeated her verses to a local family news of her &#145;soon became a Town Talk&#146;. <span class="italic">The Woman's Labour</span> was published at her own expense in 1739, the <span class="italic">Advertisement</span> stating &#145;Her Friends are of Opinion that the Novelty of a <i>Washer-woman</i>'s turning Poetess, will procure her some Readers&#146;. The novelty was too much for some: the 1740 edition includes a testimony by Petersfield citizens to the authenticity of authorship. Her later comment on this venture was: &#145;I lost nothing, neither did I gain much, others run away with the profit&#146;  (Collier, iv).<br>
<br>Mary Collier's reputation rests on <span class="italic">The Woman's Labour</span>: a spirited polemic, sharply descriptive of female labour. Witty and energetic, the poem displays a real quality of mind and technical ability in its depiction of the long hours of toil of both the agricultural labourer's wife and of the domestic servant.<br>
<br>Collier continued as a washerwoman until she was sixty-three, when she moved to Alton, Hampshire, to take care of a farmhouse. At the age of seventy, in poor health, she retired to a garret in Alton &#145;to pass the Relict of my days in Piety, Purity, Peace and an Old Maid&#146;  (Collier, v). At this time she prepared for publication her <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, which was well supported by local subscribers. She died soon after, and was buried at St Lawrence, Alton, on 20 October 1762.<br>
