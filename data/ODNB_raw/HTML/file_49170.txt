<span class="headword">Jones,  Michael Daniel</span>  (1822&#150;1898), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and college head</span>, was born on 2 March 1822 at the Chapel House, Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth, the third of the five children of Michael Jones (1785&#150;1853), Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary (1786&#150;1861).<br>
<br>Jones was educated at the Dr Williams's School conducted by his father at Llanuwchllyn. He attended the Presbyterian college, Carmarthen, from 1839 until 1843, and studied at Highbury College, Middlesex, from 1844 to 1847. Since many of his relations had emigrated to Ohio, he joined them and was ordained minister of the Lawrence Street (Welsh) Congregational Church in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 7 December 1848. He returned to Wales in the summer of 1849 and was inducted into the pastorate of Bwlchnewydd Congregational Church, Carmarthenshire, on 27 June 1850. After the death of his father in 1853 he was appointed to succeed him as principal of the college at Bala on 26 September 1854. At the same time he was inducted into the ministry of the Congregational churches at Bala, Tyn-y-bont, Bethel, Soar, and Llandderfel. He resigned the pastorates of Bala and Tyn-y-bont in 1859, but continued principal of the college until his death.<br>
<br>On 20 December 1859 at Pen-dref chapel, Ruthin, Denbighshire, Jones married Anne Lloyd (1831&#150;1925), the daughter of John and Mary Lloyd of Pistyll, Bodfari, Flintshire; Mary had been married to Hugh Davies, Plas-yn-rhal, before 1851. They had two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Llwyd ap Iwan, a land surveyor, was murdered in Patagonia on 29 December 1909 by the notorious Sundance Kid. His brother, Mihangel ap Iwan, was a successful surgeon in Buenos Aires. One daughter, Mair, died in 1898 and the other, Myfanwy, married Professor Thomas Rhys (1852&#150;1930) of Bala-Bangor College, Bangor.<br>
<br>Jones's passionate interest in radical politics soon became evident at Bala. Rural Wales had long been under the thumb of tory landlords, and typical of the class was the MP for Merioneth, W. W. E. Wynne (1801&#150;1880), the distinguished antiquary. Jones organized the Bala Reform Society to oppose Wynne. This was the beginning of the campaign that was to secure victory for the Liberals in the election of 1868.<br>
<br>Jones is often called, not unjustly, the father of twentieth-century Welsh nationalism. During his stay in the United States he had noticed how soon Welsh identity was lost there and conceived a scheme to create a Welsh settlement in Argentina. The first settlers landed at Port Madryn, as they were to call it, on 28 July 1865. His hope was that a Welsh-speaking republic could be created in Patagonia, but the Argentine government would have none of it. Nevertheless the settlement, which had caused Jones much anxiety, effort, and expense, eventually began to flourish, and was still Welsh-speaking at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Jones realized that the struggle for the maintenance of the Welsh identity had to be fought in Wales itself. His contribution there was to politicize the older cultural nationalism, and he nurtured the hope that a Welsh nationalist party would eventually take its place in parliament. His was a moderate nationalism, inspired by the work of Kossuth in Hungary and Mazzini in Italy. He argued for a federal union within the United Kingdom and pioneered the idea that this should be part of a federal European union on the pattern of the United States. He was a sharp critic of Victorian imperialism, and like other radicals condemned what he saw as the wasteful ostentation of the royal family. Unlike other Victorian radicals, he did not approve of unalloyed <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism and argued for an economy based on co-operative principles.<br>
<br>All this involved Jones in constant controversy. The most bitter of his controversies, however, had to do with his own college. A plan was launched to mark the bicentenary of the Great Ejection of 1662 by merging the Bala College with the other Congregational college at Brecon. The prime mover was the formidable John Thomas of Liverpool (1821&#150;1892). Jones opposed the plan. In the trial of strength that followed, Jones was ejected from the principalship in 1879, but he and his supporters continued to maintain their college. This meant that there were two colleges at Bala. The controversy split the Congregational denomination, and only in 1892 was it possible to reunite the colleges at Bangor under the name Bala-Bangor College.<br>
<br>In theology Jones was an evangelical Arminian, and always claimed that his political principles grew out of his evangelical theology and his Congregationalism. He was a striking character. He always wore homespun clothes and ate plain food. He was a teetotaller and vigorous opponent of smoking, yet he enjoyed nothing more than a day's shooting. He was also the first Welsh nonconformist minister to wear a beard. Virtually all his writing was in articles to a variety of Welsh periodicals. He died at his home, Bodiwan, in Bala, on 2 December 1898 and was buried in the cemetery of the Old Chapel, Llanuwchllyn, on 8 December.<br>
