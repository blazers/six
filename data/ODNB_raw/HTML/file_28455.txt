<span class="headword">Walerand,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1273), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of William Walerand of Whaddon in Wiltshire, and Isabel, daughter of Roger de Berkeley of Dursley, Gloucestershire, by her second marriage. He had two brothers: William, who married the elder daughter and coheir of Hugh of Kilpeck, Herefordshire, and John, a clerk, who joined Robert in the king's service in the 1250s. &#145;Maud, sister of Robert Walerand&#146; entered Romsey Abbey near Robert's bailiwick in the New Forest in 1253, and may be the Alice Walerand who became abbess in 1268. Another Alice, Robert's half-sister by his mother's first marriage, was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22392/', "Alan de Plugenet")</script>.<br>
<br>By 1242&#150;3 Robert Walerand had already succeeded to his patrimony at Whaddon, part of the Domesday barony of Walerand the Huntsman, whose descendants had often held the New Forest and the Forest of Clarendon in fee. The family's tradition of forest service and connections with the southern marches of Wales set the pattern of Walerand's early years as a royal servant. In 1243 he appears as the knight of the marcher baron, William (II) de Cantilupe, steward of the king's household. In 1244 he was granted 20 marks annually at the exchequer for his maintenance, and commissioned to take four crossbows from the Tower of London to the castle of Cardigan. On the death of Anselm, the last Marshal earl of Pembroke, in 1245 he was made custodian of his lands in west Wales, including the castle of Pembroke. From 1246 to 1250 he was also keeper of Gloucester Castle and sheriff of Gloucestershire; in 1247 he was made custodian of the bishopric of St David's; from August 1248 to February 1254 he held the castles of Carmarthen and Cardigan, for the strengthening of which he was commissioned to extract regular payments from the abbot of Strata Florida; and from August 1250 to May 1251 he was warden of Lundy island. He was commissioned to settle disputes between marcher lords, to stop English and Welsh landlords from harbouring malefactors from the other nation, and to hear forest pleas, special assizes, and pleas of trespass in western counties. In the 1250s his forest responsibilities widened: by June 1253 he held the stewardship of the New Forest in fee; in November 1255 he was made keeper of the Forest of Dean and constable of St Briavels Castle for five years; and in September 1256 he was appointed steward of the king's forests south of Trent and to exercise all the duties of justice of the forest, with a stipend of 100 marks a year.<br>
<br>Walerand was unique in his many-sided service to the king. By 1256 he had also been for five years a steward of the household. In 1253 and 1254 he was with Henry III in Gascony, where he was surety for the king's agreements with Gascon lords and merchants, and witnessed many royal grants immediately after the king's family and any earls present. Then in March 1254 Henry accepted the papal offer of the crown of Sicily for his second son, Edmund, and began to use Walerand on the business that helped to precipitate the barons' war. The chroniclers describe how the steward and Peter d'Aigueblanche, bishop of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1268), tricked English bishops and abbots into adding their seals to blank charters on which large sums of money could be entered at Rome, in order to persuade the pope that Henry was in a position to finance his Sicilian ambitions. Matthew Paris represents Richard, earl of Cornwall, as bitterly rebuking the bishop and the steward in a parliament at Westminster in October 1255 for &#145;so wickedly persuading the king to subvert the kingdom&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 5.521). In the following year Walerand was given custody of all vacant bishoprics and abbacies so as to raise money for the &#145;Sicilian business&#146;. Between August 1255 and the spring of 1257 he was also engaged on missions with Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester, Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, John Mansel, and others to Scotland, to the princes of Germany, and to the king of France. He was one of the king's four chief ministers who in June 1257 entered into a bond for the repayment of the king's debts to Montfort, the extraordinary terms of which accepted that they should be excommunicated in case of default. In the same month he was ordered to levy 1000 marks from the vacant bishopric of Ely to repay the king's debt to Prince Edward. The money was actually received from the late bishop's executors by John Walerand, &#145;the king's clerk&#146;, and sent to Robert, who was in Wales with Edward on campaign. It was in this year that Robert's brother William obtained half of Hugh of Kilpeck's barony, including the manor and castle of Kilpeck and the keepership of the Hay of Hereford. By December 1259 these had passed to Robert, who may have purchased them in 1257 when he married Matilda, daughter and heir of Ralph Russell of Derham, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>It was Robert Walerand who &#145;swore on the king's soul&#146; in May 1258 that the state of the realm should be reformed as the magnates demanded  (Sanders, 74). At the beginning of the reform he was given custody of Salisbury Castle, commissioned to seize for the king's use the treasure of Henry's expelled half-brothers, and attended Hugh Bigod, the baronial justiciar, on eyre at Winchester. In July 1259 he was probably appointed to fill a vacancy in the council of fifteen, which committed Edward's castle of Bristol to him. But on his departure to France with the king in November 1259, he was replaced as steward of the forests south of Trent by a baronial partisan, and Edward took Bristol away from him. Walerand was busy at this time in negotiations for a settlement of Montfort's grievances over the dower of his wife, Eleanor, Henry's sister, which were holding up the conclusion of a treaty between the kings of England and France, and for the maintenance by Louis IX of 300 knights in Henry's service. In April 1260 he was sent back to England with the chancellor, Henry Wingham, and John Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1269) to declare Henry's &#145;state and intentions&#146; and prepare for his return, which heralded a worsening of relations with the baronial leaders. The mayor and citizens of London were instructed to admit to the city only such as Walerand and Philip Basset should tell them, and Walerand became, with Mansel and Peter of Savoy, one of Henry's chief advisers at the Tower of London as the king made his move to shake off the regime of the provisions. This involved for Walerand appointment in July 1261 to the strategic sheriffdom of Kent and custody of the castles of Rochester and Canterbury; to membership with Basset, the justiciar, and Walter of Merton, the chancellor, of a commission with the task of choosing new sheriffs generally; and to the wardenship of the Cinque Ports and the custody of the castles of Dover, Ludgershall, and Marlborough. In July 1262 Walerand again accompanied Henry to France. For a time in September he had custody of the king's seal when many of Henry's entourage at St Germain were laid low by plague. But on 10 October the justiciar and his &#145;bachelors&#146; in England were instructed to give unhesitating faith to Robert Walerand over the message he was bringing from the king, which was perhaps in connection with the threat of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd to break the truce that Walerand had sworn to on the king's behalf in 1260.<br>
<br>In the event it was Simon de Montfort who brought general war in June 1263, his partisans first seizing Aigueblanche in his own cathedral, then Walerand's castle of Kilpeck and the towns of the marches from Bristol to Shrewsbury. In the following month, as Montfort closed on London, Walerand appeared in the company of Edward when the prince sought to gain control of the king's treasure at the Temple. His old association with Aigueblanche in extorting money for the &#145;Sicilian business&#146; still figured prominently in the barons' case as it was presented to King Louis in January 1264. But he recovered his lands on renewing his oath to the provisions, and was able to re-establish himself in the marches and lead Edward's castellans to redeem the situation when King Henry and his son were captured at the battle of Lewes on 14 May. After the defeat and death of Montfort at Evesham in August 1265 Walerand allegedly proposed the disinheritance of those who had fought against the king, and imposed a huge fine on the city of London. But he was one of the authors of the dictum of Kenilworth which provided in October 1266 &#145;for the state of the realm especially in the matter of the disinherited&#146;  (Sanders, 319). In his remaining years he continued to attest royal writs, serve on special assizes, and negotiate truces with the Welsh. In 1269 he was again in Paris with Edward to make arrangements with King Louis for a crusade, and he was one of the five, headed by Richard of Cornwall, appointed in 1270 to look after the prince's interests while he was away. In this role he was soon replaced by Robert Burnell, the future chancellor of King Edward, and he died in late January or early February 1273, before the new king's return.<br>
<br>Royal service brought Walerand extensive properties, some in Ireland, others (notably Hugh de Neville's borough of Stogursey in Somerset) from the disinherited. But he had no children, and his heir was his brother William's seventeen-year-old son, Robert, an idiot for whom Walerand was reputed to have secured the royal ordinance that removed the overlord's rights of wardship in such a case and transferred the safeguarding of the idiot's interests to the king. In fact, long before his death, Walerand had enfeoffed his half-sister's son, the staunch royalist Alan (II) de Plugenet, with the castle and manor of Kilpeck and the family lands in Wiltshire, taking them back as life tenancies.<br>
