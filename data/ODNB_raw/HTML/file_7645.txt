<span class="headword">Dilke,  Charles Wentworth</span>  (1789&#150;1864), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and writer</span>, was born on 8 December 1789 at Bedhampton, Hampshire, the third of four children and elder son of Sarah Blewford (1765/6&#150;1825) and Charles Wentworth Dilke (1742/3&#150;1826), a chief clerk in the paymaster branch of the Admiralty. Although he attended schools in Portsea and London, his education was primarily by private tutoring. In April 1805 he entered the navy pay office of the Admiralty as a clerk, and in London, on 10 October 1806, he married Maria Walker (1790&#150;1850), daughter of an official in the East India Company. They had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7646/', "(Charles) Wentworth Dilke (1810&#150;1869)")</script>, who served as leading commissioner of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and later became first baronet; he, in turn, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32824/', "Charles Wentworth Dilke (1843&#150;1911)")</script>, politician and cabinet minister. In 1816 the family settled in Wentworth House, Hampstead, which they built with Charles Armitage Brown, an old school friend, and it was here, probably early in 1817, that Dilke made the acquaintance of members of the &#145;cockney school&#146; such as Leigh Hunt, John Hamilton Reynolds, Thomas Hood, and John Keats, all of whom became close friends. He also knew Shelley. In April 1819 when the Dilkes moved to Westminster, where Dilke was to remain until the early 1850s, Mrs Brawne occupied the Dilkes' portion of the Hampstead house. Long after Keats's death, Dilke was active in the affairs of the Keats family and served as a trustee for Fanny Brawne. Dilke's friendship with Charles Brown ended in 1830 in a disagreement over the probity of George Keats, which Dilke defended robustly and Brown denounced. Later commentators endorsed Brown's view, noting Dilke's inflexibility once he formed an opinion, and citing Lamb's phrase &#145;a Dilkish blockhead&#146; and Keats's opinion that Dilke was &#145;a Godwin-Methodist&#146; who lacked the gift of negative capability  (Richardson, 119&#150;20).<br>
<br>Dilke's leisure hours were devoted to reading and, sharing the enthusiasm for the Elizabethan dramatists which was fostered by the publication of Lamb's <span class="italic">Specimens of the English Dramatic Poets</span>, he began to edit Renaissance play texts. William Gifford, editor of Massinger and Jonson as well as the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, encouraged him, and between 1814 and 1815 Dilke published the first of his antiquarian works, a continuation of Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Old English Plays, being a Selection from the Early Dramatic Writers</span>.<br>
<br>From about 1818 Dilke began to contribute anonymously to the crop of new periodicals, and when Henry Southern's distinctively antiquarian <span class="italic">Retrospective Review</span> started in 1820, Dilke became one of its contributors. His anonymous pieces in <span class="italic">The Champion</span> (1818) edited by John Scott, <span class="italic">The Retrospective</span>, the Benthamite <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> (1830), also edited by Southern, and probably other magazines of the period, were mainly literary. In 1821 he produced a political pamphlet addressed to Lord John Russell, which was characteristically radical in tone, and pleaded for the repeal of the corn laws. This caught the attention of John Taylor, by then editor of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, who invited both antiquarian and political contributions from Dilke, the latter of which, in 1823, became a dominant political voice of the journal's monthly &#145;View of public affairs&#146;. In January 1824, in the first of his editing stints, Dilke became editor of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, with &#145;its passion for anciency&#146;  (Bauer, 246), and probably served a year until Southern took over in 1825. Dilke's lifelong radical politics are clearly visible here, before he took on the mantle of neutrality that characterized his association with <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. So closely was Dilke associated with the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, its circle, and the ethos of honest journalism promulgated by its first editor, John Scott, that Dilke's conduct of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> has been seen by Bauer  (ibid., 335) as a continuation of the cultural work of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (1828&#150;) was a London arts and science weekly which eschewed politics and religion; in its earliest years it was closely associated with the Cambridge Apostles. It was purchased first by John Sterling and eventually in 1830 by a group which included Dilke, the latter becoming editor in that year. The effect of his firm hand on the management of the paper was speedily seen. In 1831 he reduced the price by half to 4<i>d</i>., a measure which resulted in a marked increase in its sales and a corresponding reduction in the circulation of its rival, the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> at the then customary price of 8<i>d</i>. Alarmed by the change, the majority of his co-proprietors gave up their shares while continuing to write for it, leaving the financial responsibility to Dilke and the printer, James Holmes. Gathering support from a group which included Lamb, Barry Cornwall, H. F. Chorley, George Darley, and other friends, Dilke also enlisted the aid of Sainte-Beuve, Jules Janin, and other continental writers of repute, an unusual move for a British journalist at the time. Although the circulation of the paper responded quickly and dramatically to the reduction in price, the heavy tax on advertisements prohibited their growth in the paper, and for several years there was no surplus profit; throughout his tenure as editor Dilke worked without a salary, putting profits back into the business.<br>
<br>The main principle of Dilke's editorship was to preserve a complete independence from the trade, and to criticize a book without concern for the writer or the publisher; promulgated most concertedly between 1830 and 1832, this antipathy to puffing was singular at the time. To maintain it Dilke withdrew from general society, confining his social life to entertaining at home, and thus avoiding as far as possible personal contact with authors or publishers who might seek to influence the reviews in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. In 1836 the navy pay office was abolished and Dilke, retired on a pension, was able to devote all his energies to the improvement of the paper. By the 1840s <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>'s success was established, and Dilke handed over the editorship to T. K. Hervey in 1846. In that year too W. J. Thoms's monthly columns of material on folklore began appearing in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> with Dilke's encouragement, and so popular did they become that in 1849 Thoms founded <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> to accommodate the burgeoning material.<br>
<br>Called in to aid the infant <span class="italic">Daily News</span>&#151;by this time abandoned by Dickens and edited by John Forster&#151;Dilke became its manager in April 1846; he reduced the price of the daily by half from 5<i>d.</i> to 2&frac12;<i>d</i>., halved the number of pages from eight to four, and increased the amount of copy. Although the circulation rose from 4000 to 22,000 per day, the paper lost money, and the old price was eventually restored in February 1849. Closure was avoided, despite a massive drop in sales, and in April 1849 Dilke completed his contract and retired. <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> in 1864 commended Dilke's <span class="italic">Daily News</span> prospectus for its strong endorsement of the importance of the newspaper press and praised his foresight in creating a cheap daily before the removal of the stamp duty, lamenting that &#145;had this policy been persevered in there can be little doubt that the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> would have occupied a foremost position in the cheap issue of the present day&#146;  (31 Aug 1864, 526). In 1850 his wife died, and by 1853 Dilke had moved from Lower Grosvenor Street to the house of his son in Sloane Street, where he acted as companion and mentor to his grandson.<br>
<br>A third period in Dilke's career began with his retirement from newspaper management, and all the articles on which his literary reputation rests are subsequent to 1847. While editing <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> he had on principle avoided writing in it; having ceased to edit it he became a contributor. The mystery attaching to the authorship of the highly political &#145;Letters of Junius&#146;, which appeared from 1768 to 1772 in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, especially fascinated him, and he acquired a knowledge of everything bearing on the problem that has remained unsurpassed  (Ellegard, 10). Unlike others, he was not so anxious to identify the author of the articles as to show who he was not. He commenced in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> of July 1848 by demolishing John Britton's theory that Colonel Barre was Junius, and over the next five years he wrote a series of reviews which form the most weighty contribution of his day to the controversy. The Junius pieces led to the study of Edmund Burke and John Wilkes MP, founder in 1762 of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span>. Dilke was the first to rescue Wilkes from the obloquy that attached to his name for allegedly libelling the king in 1745 and for publishing the obscene &#145;Essay on women&#146;. He also became the apologist for the satires of Peter Pindar, the pseudonym of John Wolcot.<br>
<br>Articles on Pope followed, informed by Dilke's purchase of the Caryll papers in 1854. In a series of contributions to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> Dilke was able to explain the mystery of the publication of the letters by Edmund Curll, to make clear the poet's parentage, to settle several matters in his early life, to identify the &#145;Unfortunate lady&#146;, and in various other points to throw fresh light on Pope's career and his poetry. These articles brought the writer into controversy with various Pope scholars, but his conclusions remained unshaken and were adopted by Whitwell Elwin in his edition of Pope (1871&#150;89). One of his last articles in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> was devoted to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and her quarrel with Pope, an article prompted by the appearance of Moy Thomas's edition of her work in 1861. Other issues to which Dilke turned in his retirement included the systemization of the British Museum catalogue and establishing the corpus of work by Jonathan Swift which involved the attribution of work by &#145;William Wagstaffe&#146; to Swift.<br>
<br>In his later life the reform of the Literary Fund occupied a large part of Dilke's attention. As early as 1836 he had begun to scrutinize its management from within its general committee; but it was not until 1849 that the controversy, which had been regularly reported in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, became open and heated. In 1858 he joined with Dickens and John Forster in the pamphlet called &#145;The case of the reformers of the Literary Fund&#146;, part of which appeared in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (6 March 1858, 304&#150;6). The reformers, although they had the best of the argument, had the worst of the voting, and finding it impossible to convert their minority into a majority, they attempted, with the aid of Lord Lytton, to found the Guild of Art and Literature, a scheme which did not meet with the success anticipated.<br>
<br>In 1862 Dilke withdrew altogether from London, and settled at Alice Holt near Farnham in Hampshire where he died from kidney disease on 10 August 1864. He was buried privately on 16 August in Kensal Green cemetery, London. The best contemporary comments on his character and work were those of his old friend W. J. Thoms, in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>:<blockquote>The distinguishing feature of his character was his singular love of truth, and his sense of its value and importance, even in the minutest points and questions of literary history. What the independence of English literary journalism owes to his spirited exertions, clear judgment, and unflinching honesty of purpose will, we trust, be told hereafter. (13 Aug 1864, 140)</blockquote>
