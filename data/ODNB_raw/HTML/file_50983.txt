<span class="headword">Durlacher,  Lewis</span>  (1792&#150;1864), <span class="occ">chiropodist</span>, was born probably in Warwickshire, the son of Solomon Abraham Durlacher (1757&#150;1845), chiropodist and dentist, and his wife, Elizabeth Harris. He learnt the craft of chiropody from his father, in Bath, Somerset. About 1816 Durlacher commenced practice at 22 St James's Street, London. He had the support of several surgeons, including Sir Astley Paston Cooper, which was unusual because chiropody was regarded as a humble, non-medical trade. In 1826 he won the approval of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> after he demonstrated his treatment for embedded toenails at the hospital of surgery in Panton Square. From 1823 until his death he was surgeon-chiropodist to the royal household of three successive sovereigns: George IV, William IV, and Victoria. He was presented with a snuff box engraved &#145;To my friend Lewis Durlacher from William IV&#146;.<br>
<br>Durlacher's book, <span class="italic">A Treatise on Corns, Bunions, the Diseases of Nails, and the General Management of the Feet</span>, was published in 1845. It had good reviews; the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Medical Review</span> (19, 1845, 560&#150;1) considered it &#145;the result obviously of much experience and written in a fair and honest spirit. It is, in fact, the only work on the subject which has any pretensions to scientific accuracy&#146;. An American edition appeared the same year and had considerable influence. The book contained the first description of plantar digital neuroma, and included the best accounts of the embedded toenail and the inward-forming wart. He also developed the use of silver nitrate.<br>
<br>Durlacher tried to establish a free dispensary for people with diseases of the foot. He believed that the public should be protected from empirics either by legislation or by the medical licensing bodies' making the study of diseases of the feet part of the medical curriculum.<br>
<br>Durlacher married Susanna Levi (1798&#150;1874) on 2 January 1820. They had five sons and one daughter. He had a thorough education in scripture and Hebrew literature. Active in the Jewish community in London, he took a leading part in the affairs of the Western Synagogue. Durlacher died at his home and place of practice, 15 Old Burlington Street, London, on 3 March 1864.<br>
