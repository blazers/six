<span class="headword">Marshall,  Francis <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1845&#150;1906), <span class="occ">rugby administrator and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 19 September 1845 at Witton Lane, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, the son of John William Marshall, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Sarah Salt. He was educated at Brewood School, then entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1864, graduating BA as thirty-eighth wrangler in the mathematical tripos in 1868. He proceeded MA in 1880. He was ordained in 1869 and between 1868 and 1870 was vice-principal of Carmarthen Training College. From 1870 to 1878 he was headmaster of Wednesbury Collegiate School and in 1878 was appointed head of King James's Grammar School in Almondbury, near Huddersfield, in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Marshall was the embodiment of the late nineteenth-century quest for the purity of amateur ideals in rugby. His influence was such that the centenary history of the Rugby Football Union acclaimed him as &#145;one of the game's immortals&#146;. He had played rugby as a schoolboy, but it was only when he took up the headmastership at Almondbury that he began to make his mark on the game. He became a well-respected referee, and was noted for occasionally smoking a cigar while refereeing. But it was following his election to the committee of the Yorkshire Rugby Union (YRU) in 1887 that he became most famous. Seeking to exorcize the evil of professionalism from rugby, Marshall helped to conduct more than twenty trials of clubs and players accused of professionalism, including two of the future England captain Dicky Lockwood. In 1890 he was elected president of the YRU.<br>
<br>Although initially supportive, Yorkshire rugby clubs discovered that the suspension of players and clubs caused by Marshall's campaign was incompatible with the business exigencies of running successful teams. Growing support for payments to players to compensate them for time lost from work&#151;&#145;broken time&#146;&#151;alienated Marshall from the leadership of Yorkshire rugby. In 1893 he was instrumental in helping to suspend his own club, Huddersfield, for breaches of rugby's amateur code, an act which estranged him from any remaining sympathizers in Yorkshire rugby union. In 1896 he left Almondbury to become rector of Mileham in Norfolk.<br>
<br>As a muscular Christian, Marshall was a firm believer in the importance of rugby in &#145;developing the physique, in influencing the character, and in improving the moral as well as the physical well being of the working man player&#146;  (<span class="italic"><span class="roman">&#145;Payment for Broken Time at Rugby Football&#146;</span>, Athletic News Football Annual</span>, 1893). Unfortunately for Marshall, these values were rarely shared by their intended recipients and he found himself heckled at meetings, stoned by schoolboys, and, on one occasion, jostled at his local railway station.<br>
<br>To posterity Marshall is mainly remembered for his book <span class="italic">Football: the Rugby Union Game</span> (1892), still regarded as the definitive work on the history and development of rugby in the nineteenth century, combining Marshall's own work with contributions from many of the game's leading players and administrators. Although written to demonstrate the importance of the public schools to a game increasingly dominated by working-class players and spectators, the book is notable for the absence of any mention of William Webb Ellis, ostensibly the founder of rugby football. This apparent anomaly is explained by the fact that the book was published three years before the Old Rugbeian Society, on dubious grounds, ascribed to Ellis his place in history. Marshall was also the author of school textbooks on Shakespeare, Sir Walter Scott, Euclid, and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He died at Mileham on 19 April 1906, following an operation. He was buried six days later at Mileham church, leaving a widow, Catharine Ann, the daughter of John E. Taylor of Almondbury.<br>
