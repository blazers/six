<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  Horace Maybray</span>, Baron Maybray-King  (1901&#150;1986), <span class="occ">politician and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born on 25 May 1901 at 91 Stapylton Street, Grangetown, near Middlesbrough, the second child in the family of two sons and two daughters of John William King, insurance agent (previously steelworker), and his wife, Margaret Ann Maybray. He was educated at Norton council school and Stockton secondary school. He obtained first-class honours in English at King's College, London University, in 1922 and in the same year was appointed to a teaching post at Taunton's School in Southampton. He became head of English in 1930, and remained there until 1947, when he became headmaster of Regent's Park secondary school in Southampton. He was an inspiring teacher, able to secure respect in a formal environment without heavy use of sanctions. A duodenal ulcer meant that he was not liable for military service in the Second World War. For several years he studied part-time for a PhD on Shakespeare, and his thesis was accepted by King's College in 1940. He published widely on subjects as diverse as Homer, Macaulay, parliament, and Sherlock Holmes.<br>
<br>On 21 December 1924 King married Victoria Florence (1896/7&#150;1966), daughter of George Harris, bookseller. Born in Southwark, prior to her marriage she was a schoolteacher. Once in Southampton she became a significant political figure. A Labour councillor in 1928&#150;31 and from 1933, she was coronation mayor in 1953 and played a leading role in hospital administration. In political circles Horace King initially tended to be viewed as Mrs King's husband. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>King joined the socialist society at university and was a Labour Party member from his arrival in Southampton. By the mid-1930s his concern over British foreign policy led to support for a united front. He narrowly escaped expulsion from the Southampton Labour Party after sharing a platform with communists.<br>
<br>In the Labour landslide of 1945 King unsuccessfully fought the safe Conservative constituency of New Forest and Christchurch. The following year he was elected to Hampshire county council, serving with one three-year break until 1965, and eventually becoming Labour Party group leader. He was elected to the House of Commons in February 1950 as member for the extremely marginal Southampton Test constituency. Prior to the 1955 election King succeeded in transferring his candidacy to the adjacent and much safer Itchen constituency.<br>
<br>King quickly demonstrated a flair for publicity. He arrived at the House of Commons for the first time wearing a cloth cap in memory of James Keir Hardie, and made the first maiden speech of all the 1950 entrants. He was a very active back-bencher; within the Parliamentary Labour Party he stood with the right. He was a keen supporter of the Anglo-American alliance, making frequent visits to the United States, and he backed Hugh Gaitskell against unilateralism, but he was never a factionalist and attempted to remain on good terms with all sections of the party.<br>
<br>As early as 1953 King joined the speaker's panel. In November 1964, following Labour's return to office, he became chairman of ways and means and deputy speaker. Almost a year later, with the death of Sir Harry Hylton-Foster in September 1965, he became the first speaker from the Labour benches. At the same time he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>King assumed the speakership in a context of increasing demands for parliamentary reform. While no procedural die-hard, he was a traditionalist with a generally rosy view of established practices. One innovation, the speeding up of question time, probably reduced further the influence of the back-bencher. His speakership saw changes in parliamentary procedure that could seem significant by comparison with earlier inertia, but in real terms they were modest. Unlike many of his predecessors, he had no legal training but his headmasterly and avuncular style soon established his authority.<br>
<br>King retired as speaker at the end of 1970. He became a life peer, as Baron Maybray-King, in 1971 and attended the House of Lords regularly for several years, serving as deputy speaker there. His career contained much that was characteristic of Labour politics of the first half of the twentieth century. He was self-improving, cautiously reformist, and respectful of many venerable British practices. Yet there were paradoxes. The traditionalist was a showman; as speaker he turned on the Blackpool illuminations. In Southampton he seemed a proper, somewhat puritanical, figure; at Westminster he was highly clubbable and well known in the bars. He was an accomplished player of the piano and piano accordion and loved entertaining children. The bonhomie masked a more complex and elusive character. Maybray-King had honorary degrees from Southampton (1967), London (1967), Durham (1968), Bath (1969), Ottawa (1969), and Loughborough (1971), and was honorary FRCP.<br>
<br>King's first wife died in 1966. He then married on 22 July 1967 Una (1906/7&#150;1978), daughter of William Herbert Porter, industrial manager. His second wife was a retired Southampton headmistress and had been King's honorary chauffeur in the last years of his political career. She died in 1978 and Maybray-King married on 30 January 1981 Mrs Ivy Duncan Forster (<i>b</i>. 1914/15), a widow from co. Durham. She was the daughter of John Edward Davison, miner. The marriage was dissolved in 1985, and finally, on 29 March 1986, Maybray-King married Sheila Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), retired secretary and daughter of John Atkinson, dental mechanic. There were no children of the last three marriages. Maybray-King died in the Royal Hampshire Hospital, Southampton, on 3 September 1986.<br>
