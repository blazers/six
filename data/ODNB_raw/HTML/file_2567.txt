<span class="headword">Blair,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and chronologist</span>, was descended from the Blairs of Balthayock, Perthshire, although precise information about his parents, date of birth, and early years is lacking. He was born and educated in Edinburgh, where he trained for a career in the Church of Scotland along with Hugh Blair, Alexander Carlyle, John Home, William Robertson, and other young men who would become notable for their association with the Scottish Enlightenment. According to Carlyle's memoirs, he obtained his licence to preach in Scotland, but before receiving a Scottish pastoral charge he visited London with a patrimony of several hundred pounds, and ended up taking orders in the Church of England and remaining in London for the rest of his life. His first known position there was as an usher at a school in Hedge Lane.<br>
<br>In the early 1750s Blair issued <span class="italic">Proposals for Printing by Subscription, the General Chronology and History of the World</span>, a work he is said to have adapted from chronological tables originally devised by his Edinburgh classmate and distant relation, Hugh Blair. <span class="italic">The Chronology and History of the World</span> was published in London in early summer 1754. The book quickly became the standard work of its kind and was frequently reprinted throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. To the 1768 edition Blair added a set of fourteen maps and &#145;A dissertation on the rise and progress of geography&#146;, which were also published separately in the same year, and in 1784 an expanded version of his dissertation was published in a smaller duodecimo format. A French translation of <span class="italic">The Chronology and History of the World</span> appeared in Paris in 1797, and there were several American editions in the 1820s. From 1856 onwards it was known as <span class="italic">Blair's Chronological Tables, Revised and Enlarged</span>, although the editor of the 1856 London edition, J. Willoughby Rosse, declared in the preface that &#145;all that remains of <i>Blair</i> is the general outline&#146; (xii); a London edition was published with that title as late as 1904.<br>
<br>The success of Blair's book led to the author's election as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1755; in the same year he published a paper, &#145;Agitation of the waters near Reading&#146;, in the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In 1761 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In September 1757, through the influence at Leicester House of John Home and Gilbert Elliot, among others, Blair was appointed chaplain to Augusta, princess-dowager of Wales (to whom he later dedicated some editions of his <span class="italic">Chronology and History</span>), and mathematics tutor to her son Prince Edward, later duke of York, whom he accompanied on a continental tour in 1763&#150;4. He subsequently served as Edward's secretary, and owed to him his appointment as prebendary of Westminster in March 1761, which was later followed by presentation of the dean and chapter of Westminster to the vicarage of Hinckley, to the vicarage of St Bride's, London, in 1771, and to the rectory of St John the Evangelist, Westminster, in 1776. He was also rector of Horton in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Alexander Carlyle called Blair &#145;a lively agreeable fellow, and one of the most friendly men in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 198), but he also observed that Blair was &#145;disliked by many people, particularly by [Tobias] Smollett&#146; on account of &#145;a certain petulant and wrangling humour&#146; and &#145;his flippancy of speech&#146;  (ibid., 353&#150;4). Blair died in Dean's Yard, Westminster, on 24 June 1782. Three years later Thomas Cadell published by subscription a quarto edition of his only religious work, <span class="italic">Lectures on the canon of the scriptures, comprehending a dissertation on the Septuagint version</span>, which had been delivered in the cathedral church of Westminster. It was dedicated to the king by the author's widow, Anne Persode Blair, who is identified in the anonymous editor's advertisement as the person &#145;upon whose account the publication was undertaken&#146;  (xii).<br>
