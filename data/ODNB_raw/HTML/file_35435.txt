<span class="headword">Pearce,  Stephen</span>  (1819&#150;1904), <span class="occ">portrait and equestrian painter</span>, was born on 16 November 1819 in London at the King's Mews, Charing Cross, to Stephen Pearce and his wife, Ann Whittington. Pearce's father was an official in the department of the master of the horse. In 1840 Pearce attended Henry Sass's academy in Charlotte Street and in the same year was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools. There he became a pupil of Sir Martin Shee in 1841. From 1842 to 1846 he acted as amanuensis to the novelist Charles Lever. After this employment, Pearce travelled to Italy, presumably as part of his artistic training.<br>
<br>Pearce exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy in 1839. The work, a portrait of one of his favourite horses (Tartar) in Queen Victoria's stables, set the tone for his career, and he became known for his equestrian portraits and groups, such as <span class="italic">Coursing at Ashdown Park</span> from 1869. Many of Pearce's early works were pictures of the queen's horses; as he recalled: &#145;Living at the Royal Mews, in the midst of the Queen's horses, I was always making sketches and paintings of them&#146;  (Pearce, 21). Colonel John Barrow, keeper of the Admiralty records and a friend of Pearce, brought him the commission for his painting <span class="italic">The Arctic Council Discussing a Plan of Search for Sir John Franklin</span>, a work that highlighted another important genre in Pearce's artistic output: portraiture. Completed in 1851, the work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1853 and sparked public interest in Franklin's fate. The work was sent to Buckingham Palace for viewing by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and an engraving by James Scott after Pearce's canvas furthered its circulation and popularity. Lady Franklin commissioned Pearce to paint the portraits of other Arctic explorers. All of these portraits are now at the National Portrait Gallery, London. In the midst of these commissions, Pearce married Matilda Jane Cheswright on 13 April 1858, and they had five sons. Throughout his career, Pearce exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, the Suffolk Street Gallery, and the Grosvenor Gallery. His works were regularly engraved and were praised at the time for being well-drawn, accurate likenesses.<br>
<br>Pearce retired from painting in 1885, and the contents of his studio were sold by Christies on 5 February 1886. In 1903 Pearce published his autobiographical <span class="italic">Memories of the Past</span>. He died on 31 January 1904 at his home, 44 Sussex Gardens, Bayswater, London, and was buried at the Old Town cemetery in Eastbourne, Sussex.<br>
