<span class="headword">Tate,  (Alexander) Norman</span>  (1837&#150;1892), <span class="occ">analytical chemist and teacher of science</span>, was born on 24 February 1837 at Wells, Somerset, the son of James Tate, an alderman, and his wife, Emma Norman. He was educated at the cathedral grammar school and in 1857, after practising pharmacy for a time, he began studying chemistry in the laboratory of James Sheridan Muspratt's Royal College of Chemistry in Duke Street, Liverpool. In 1860 he was engaged as an analyst by John Hutchinson &amp; Co., alkali manufacturers of Widnes, but in 1863 he and his brother, Frank, established their own analytical and consulting practice in Newstead Road, Windsor South, Liverpool.<br>
<br>Tate, in several analytical papers (published by the Chemical Society of London), paid particular attention to the study of American petroleum which was then being brought onto the market as an illuminant. Following the publication of his <span class="italic">Petroleum and its Products</span> (1863), which was translated into French and German, he temporarily gave up his Liverpool practice in order to erect oil refineries processing coal and shale on the Isle of Man and in Flintshire. In 1869 he married Elizabeth Millicent Faulkes of Claughton, Lancashire; the couple had two daughters. On his marriage Tate rejoined his brother in consultancy, at the same time establishing a School of Technical Chemistry in Old Hall Street, Liverpool. In 1873 the school became the Liverpool College of Science and Technology in new premises in Hackins Hey. Classes were conducted in a basement hall fitted with benches, the students having to provide their own apparatus. Here, besides teaching chemistry, Tate gained a considerable reputation as a specialist in the analysis of oils, fats, and waxes for W. H. Lever and other soap and food manufacturers.<br>
<br>Tate was an original member of the Society of Chemical Industry on its foundation in 1881, and was at various times president and vice-president of its Liverpool section. He also took a prominent part in furthering scientific education in Liverpool. In partnership with James Samuelson in 1871, and under the aegis of the Department of Science and Art, he founded operatives' evening classes. Tate taught chemistry, botany, physiology, and general biology in these classes and founded both the Liverpool Science Students' Association and the Liverpool Science and Art Teachers' Association. In addition, he was active in local geological and microscopical associations, being particularly interested in the chemical geology of the Merseyside boulder clay. In 1880, at Liverpool town hall, he was awarded a public testimonial for his educational work. In 1888 he founded a monthly magazine, <span class="italic">Research</span>, which was devoted to the popularization of science, but editing proved too time-consuming and it was discontinued at the close of its second year. A man of tremendous energy and enthusiasm, Tate died from cancer, at his home, Benarth, 27 Shrewsbury Road, Orton, Birkenhead, on 22 July 1892, leaving &#145;a void in the intellectual life of Liverpool&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geological Society Proceedings</span>). The firm of Norman Tate &amp; Co., consulting chemists, continued.<br>
