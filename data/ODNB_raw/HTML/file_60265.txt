</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Core,  Philip McCammon</span>  (1951&#150;1989), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born in Dallas, Texas, on 7 June 1951. He spent his early childhood in Delhi, where his father, an alcoholic journalist, was temporarily vice-consul, before returning to New Orleans, where at the age of six he went to school at the military academy. When he was seven he won first prize in the Vieux Carr&eacute; artists' open competition.<br>
<br>Although New Orleans was to remain a profound influence on Core's life with its atmosphere of southern Gothic and dandyism, he escaped his family at the first opportunity, in 1963, by winning a scholarship to Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, one of the pre-eminent east coast preparatory schools. From there he went to Harvard University in 1969. He led a colourful undergraduate life making experimental films and designing for a New York boutique, and spent a year in Paris. Here, under the auspices of Philippe Jullian, whom he helped research for his book <span class="italic">The Symbolists</span> (1973), he met surviving members of the Cocteau set. In 1973 Core graduated <i>cum laude</i>, with an honours thesis on the Belgian symbolist Fernand Khnopff, and later that year left for Europe to study for a postgraduate course at the Ruskin School of Drawing, at Oxford, where he designed a ceiling painting for the Oxford Union. Hating Oxford, he transferred to the Academia degli Belli Arti in Florence in 1974; he settled in London later that same year. In Oxford, Florence, and London he cultivated friends who were members of the <i>demi-monde</i>. He had a great capacity both for making friends and for falling out with them.<br>
<br>From the beginning Philip Core's literary and artistic work explored his homosexuality, and appeared in the gay press. His art often featured a &#145;specific type of male, sometimes as threatening, sometimes as innocent as an animal&#146;  (Melly, <span class="italic">Philip Core</span>, 6). Core's first British exhibition was &#145;Heroes and Monuments&#146; at the Hammond Lloyd Gallery, London, in 1976; it was followed in 1979 by &#145;Pieces of Conversation&#146; at the Francis Kyle Gallery, which consisted of fictive conversations between some of his (mainly literary) heroes, including a conversation between Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford, and Warhol playing chess with Marcel Duchamp.<br>
<br>Core's career as a painter looked as if it might take off, but unfortunately his patience and artistic technique never quite matched the grandeur of his visual ambition. In his third exhibition, &#145;Novels without Words&#146; (1980), he successfully combined his interests in pop art and baroque fiction, but thereafter his work tended to be large-scale and too slapdash. In order to support himself financially, he sought commissions including <span class="italic">The Ideal Party</span> (1980) a commemorative mural, rapidly lost, over the entrance to the Ritz Hotel, London, of seventy-five famous guests spanning the hotel's history; an immense cyclorama commissioned by BBC television's <span class="italic">Omnibus</span> (1984); and a group portrait of the cast of the film version of <span class="italic">Brideshead Revisited</span>.<br>
<br>Core, however, had an alternative m&eacute;tier in the 1980s as a broadcaster on radio programmes such as <span class="italic">Kaleidoscope</span> for BBC Radio 4, since he was able to talk with encyclopaedic authority about almost any subject. The breadth of his intellectual interests also made him an excellent journalist. When, for example, <span class="italic">The Independent</span> was founded in 1986, he was commissioned by James Fergusson to write for the newspaper obituaries of controversial subjects such as the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and the graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, thereby contributing to the death of the po-faced official obituary. He also flourished as the paper's photographic critic. In 1984 he published two books, one a dictionary entitled <span class="italic">Camp: the Lie that Tells the Truth</span> and the other <span class="italic">The Original Eye: Arbiters of Twentieth-Century Taste</span>. Both demonstrated his exceptionally wide knowledge of the byways of twentieth-century culture.<br>
<br>But it is as much as a person as for his work that Philip Core deserves to be remembered. He lived in a flat which he painted entirely black near the Elephant and Castle, London, from which he would make excursions which were sometimes grand and more often <i>louche</i>. He dyed his hair blonde in the manner of Andy Warhol. Indeed, he might have become, like Warhol, a cult figure in later life, but was one of the first people to be diagnosed as having AIDS, at a time when the disease was scarcely known in Britain. Towards the end of his life he was involved in a case with the board of customs and excise concerning the import of visual material which it regarded as pornographic. Shortly before his death he wrote a characteristically perceptive description of himself in the catalogue of an exhibition held at the Watermans Art Centre in Brentford, Middlesex:<blockquote>I am not a great artist, only someone who loves painting, drawing and making things with his hands above all else; someone who has, by some curious gift of heredity, become possessed of articulacy and intransigence in equal degree; someone who knows what they love and feels no shame about it.</blockquote>Philip Core died on 12 November 1989 at the Westminster Hospital, London, of bronchopneumonia brought on by AIDS, and was cremated at Mortlake cemetery, London. In the 1990s, as a tribute, the composer Patrick Nunn wrote <span class="italic">Hextych</span>, a work based on Core's paintings.<br>
