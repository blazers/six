<span class="headword">Birch,  Peter</span>  (1651/2&#150;1710), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Birch, Lancashire, the eighth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66520/', "Thomas Birch (bap. 1608, d. 1678)")</script>, of Birch Hall in the parish of Manchester, a colonel in the parliamentarian army and MP for Liverpool, and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1697), daughter of Thomas Brooke of Norton, Cheshire, and his third wife, Ellen Gerrard. Thomas Birch was a loyal servant of the republic in the 1650s, and to the end was a committed puritan who ensured that Birch chapel was a haven for nonconformist ministers in the 1660s and 1670s.<br>
<br>Raised as a presbyterian by his father, Peter Birch was still committed to nonconformity when he began his education at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1667. Some time afterwards he left Cambridge and in 1670 moved with his twin brother, Andrew Birch, to the city of Oxford, where they lived with John Foulks, an apothecary, and studied in the Bodleian Library with a private tutor, William Assheton of Brasenose College. At Oxford, Birch declared his conformity to the established church by publicly taking the sacrament of holy communion. Dr John Fell, then dean of Christ Church, Oxford, facilitated his admission to Christ Church and the passage of his degree, urging a convocation of the university, &#145;That when so many run away from the church, you would think fit to encourage one who addresseth himself as free and thorough convert&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.660). Matriculating at twenty-one, on 12 May 1673, Birch was able to apply his terms of study at Cambridge to his present course of study, making it possible for him to graduate BA on 23 March 1674 and proceed MA three months later (on 23 June), soon after his move to Christ Church. He would later proceed BD (on 4 February 1684) and DD (7 July 1688).<br>
<br>After graduating BA Birch remained in Oxford, serving first as a chaplain of Christ Church and preaching occasionally in the Oxford area. To Anthony Wood in December 1675 Birch was an example of how Fell had preferred &#145;Fanaticks and rogues &hellip; sooner than try sons of the Church of England&#146;. Five years on, however, he recorded with satisfaction how Birch, &#145;a zealous man for the Church of England&#146;, &#145;swinged the phanaticques and presbyterians away&#146; in the sermon that he delivered at the university church on 30 January 1681 on the fast day appointed to commemorate the execution of Charles I (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 2.332; 2.514). In June 1685, as chaplain to the militia regiment, he delivered an exhortatory sermon as news came through to Oxford of Monmouth's rebellion. He also served as curate of St Thomas's parish before being appointed rector of St Ebbe's Church (1685&#150;6) and lecturer at Carfax. While at St Ebbe's, on 19 November 1686, Birch married his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1688), the daughter of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28556/', "Edmund Waller")</script>, at St Peter-le-Poer, London. Some time after this Birch was made chaplain to James, duke of Ormond.<br>
<br>In 1689 Birch was appointed as chaplain to the House of Commons and as a prebendary of Westminster Abbey, being installed on 17 October of that year. He appears to have served as subdeacon and archdeacon of Westminster. Following the elevation of Thomas Tenison to the see of Lincoln, Bishop Compton of London named Birch to the rectory of St James's, Westminster, on 11 July 1692. However, Queen Mary almost immediately claimed the crown's right to appointment to the living and chose William Wake instead. Defeated in the court of king's bench in November 1694 Birch appealed to the House of Lords, who likewise decided against him in January 1695 by forty votes to thirty; the teller on behalf of Birch was the high-church earl of Rochester. Two months later, on 19 March 1695, the dean and chapter of Westminster named him to the living of St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Birch's published works consist of several sermons, some of which were preached before the House of Commons. The most prominent of these was preached on 30 January 1694, the sermon for the fast day appointed to commemorate the execution of Charles I. The sermon applied David's lament over the fall of God's anointed, Saul, to the death of Charles (<span class="roman">2 Samuel</span> 1: 21). The sermon, which affirmed the divine right of kings, seemed to bring into question the legitimacy of William III and Mary II. The sermon caused considerable controversy and elicited an anonymously published response entitled <span class="italic">A Birchen Rod for Dr Birch</span>, which accused Birch of impugning the honour and title of the reigning monarchs by maligning the &#145;defensive arms by which they made a conquest of England's affections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Birchen Rod</span>, 24). The tory sentiments of the sermon and its apparent offence to the monarchs helped spark off the campaign by some whigs to abolish 30 January as a fast day, and may have contributed to the loss of St James's.<br>
<br>Birch, having lost his first wife in 1688, married Martha (<i>c</i>.1653&#150;1703), daughter of Samuel Vyner and widow of a wealthy London merchant, Francis Millington, on 24 November 1697. She died on 28 May 1703, after which the widower married Sybil Wyrley (<i>d</i>. 1708), the daughter and coheir of Humphrey Wyrley of Handsworth, Staffordshire. She died on 12 August 1708, but this last marriage produced two children, Humphrey Wyrley Birch (1706&#150;1747) and John Wyrley Birch (1707&#150;1775).<br>
<br>Birch's prospects for promotion improved after the accession of Queen Anne, and in 1702 Narcissus Luttrell reported the rumour that Birch was going to be appointed dean of Westminster. The following year he noted that Birch &#145;stands fair for the bishoprick of St Asaph, vacant by the death of Dr. Jones&#146;  (Luttrell, 5.298). Neither of these possibilities came to fruition and Birch died on 2 July 1710 and was buried in Westminster Abbey two days later. At the time of his death his two sons were left in the guardianship of his sister Deborah Birch, who was named executor in his will, dated 27 June 1710. He bequeathed his estate to his elder son, Humphrey, providing from that estate an annual allowance of &pound;200 for his younger son, John.<br>
