<span class="headword">Tong,  William</span>  (1662&#150;1727), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and nonconformist tutor</span>, was born on 24 June 1662, the son of William Tong, chapman, of Worsley in the parish of Eccles, Lancashire. His father died when Tong was young. Studying originally for the law, Tong through his mother's influence turned to the ministry, and entered the academy of Richard Frankland, then at Natland, on 2 March 1681. He was Frankland's most distinguished student. Early in 1685 he was licensed to preach, and began his ministry in Shropshire. &#145;He frequently preached to the poor people in the country, when he knew not but at the end of the sermon he might exchange the pulpit for a prison&#146;  (Newman, 34). For two years he served the families of Thomas Corbet of Stanwardine and Rowland Hunt of Boreatton as chaplain, thereby becoming acquainted with Philip Henry. He preached occasionally in the chapel of Cockshut, parish of Ellesmere, Shropshire, using a small part of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, until threatened with prosecution. Efforts were also made to persuade him to conform, including, later, by the dean of Chester. Tong first met Philip Henry's son Matthew, then a student in London, in May 1686. They formed a friendship broken only by Matthew's death in 1714.<br>
<br>With the publication of James II's declaration of indulgence in April 1687, the leading dissenters in Chester began to encourage preaching in public again. They chose Matthew Henry to be their minister, but since he was still a student in London they invited Tong &#145;to preach to them till he [Henry] came among them&#146;  (Henry, fol. 7<i>r</i>). Tong stayed for about three months, &#145;preaching with great acceptance&#146; and &#145;their numbers did daily increase, so that they found it necessary to provide a larger place&#146; even before Henry came to Chester  (Newman, 36). At Chester, Tong fell ill with what was feared to be consumption, but he recovered and went first to Wrexham as a supply, but after a few months settled at Knutsford. There he helped establish a new meeting following divisions in the parish over the appointment of a public minister. He was ordained on 4 November 1687 at Warrington. While he was at Knutsford the present meeting-house was built (it was opened in 1689), but early in 1690 he moved to Coventry and was co-pastor first with Thomas Showell (<i>d</i>. 1694), then with Joshua Oldfield (1656&#150;1729), who also conducted an academy, and finally with Matthew Warren. At Coventry, Tong maintained an active evangelical ministry, and &#145;continued long a burning and shining light, diffusing holy light and heat not only in that city, but in the country round about&#146;. Such was his zeal that, in addition to the duties to his own congregation, he frequently preached in the surrounding villages and market towns, and by his serious lively preaching &#145;laid the foundation of several societies of protestant dissenters in those places, where there were none before&#146;  (Newman, 36&#150;7).<br>
<br>When Frankland died in 1698 Tong was among those considered as his successor, but the academy closed. Tong is usually seen as Oldfield's assistant and successor in the academy at Coventry, but Vincent Carter received a grant of &pound;10 from the Presbyterian Fund in April 1696, while &#145;under the instruction of Mr Tonge of Coventry&#146;  (DWL, MS OD 68, p. 41). When Oldfield became minister at Southwark, London, in 1699, the whole business of the academy fell on Tong.<br>
<br>On the death of Nathaniel Taylor in April 1702, Tong was elected minister of the Presbyterian congregation meeting at Salters' Hall, Canon Street, London, after Josiah Chorley and Matthew Henry had declined an invitation. The congregation was the wealthiest and most charitable in London. In 1705 Tong succeeded John Howe as one of the Tuesday morning Merchant lecturers at Salters' Hall. With the deaths of more senior ministers, Tong undertook an increasingly important role in the public affairs of the dissenters. He was a member of the Presbyterian Fund board from 1703 until his death, and represented the Presbyterians on the Committee of the Three Denominations after it was revived following the accession of George I. As a consequence he was generally present on those occasions when dissenters addressed the throne. He was named by Dr Daniel Williams (<i>d</i>. 1716) as one of the original twenty-three trustees of his charity. He was also one of the first distributors of the English <i>regium donum</i> for poor ministers and their dependants in 1723.<br>
<br>Tong had considerable antiquarian interests. He corresponded with, and in May 1697 visited, Ralph Thoresby, the Leeds antiquary. He included the antiquary Humfrey Wanley, a native of Coventry, among his friends. His historical interests were certainly influenced by his part in defending dissent in the controversy over schism instigated by the publication of his friend Matthew Henry's <span class="italic">Brief Enquiry</span> in 1689. Tong's <span class="italic">Defence of Mr. M. H's Brief Enquiry into the Nature of Schism</span> (1693) included &#145;A brief historical account of nonconformity&#146;. He asked Thoresby for a copy of &#145;the Lancashire gentlemen's petition in favour of the Puritan preachers in Queen Elizabeth's reign&#146; in June 1697, but it is clear his antiquarian interests were wider than dissent. He gave Thoresby a copy of Sampson Erdswicke's manuscript &#145;survey of Staffordshire&#146; and was attempting to buy Dr Cuerden's manuscript &#145;Antiquities of Lancashire&#146; with the intention of &#145;dressing them up&#146; for publication  (<span class="italic">Letters of Eminent Men</span>, 1.287). Pressure of business increasingly prevented Tong from pursuing his historical interests. When Henry Sampson, the nonconformist historian, died in July 1700 his widow promised to preserve his papers. Unfortunately she sent them to Tong, who &#145;is a fit man, if he had leisure to make a good improvement of them; but his hands are so full of other business, that it will be lost labour to send them to him&#146;  (ibid., 1.400). By January 1709 Sampson's collection had been split: part was held by Edmund Calamy, the rest was still with Tong, where Thoresby &#145;was troubled to find them in such confusion, and so incomplete&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.36). Nevertheless Tong's contributions to nonconformist history were among his most important published works. His best-known work was the <span class="italic">Account</span> (1716) of his friend Matthew Henry.<br>
<br>Tong took a prominent part on the orthodox side in the 1718 Exeter controversy and in the Salters' Hall debate the following year. His advice was sought by a number of ministers in Devon alarmed at the growth of heterodoxy in the south-west. When the London ministers met at Salters' Hall in early 1719 to debate the issues, Tong was a leading figure demanding subscription to a declaration in favour of the Trinity. He wrote the introduction to the <span class="italic">Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity Stated &amp; Defended</span> (1719), published with three other subscribing ministers. He was an attractive figure, a man of learning, free from sectarian feeling, charitable, and &#145;an utter enemy to all real persecution, and thought that every man who did not hold principles destructive of the civil peace, ought to enjoy full liberty of conscience in matters of religion&#146;  (Newman, 39&#150;40). It is not known whether he was married. He died in London on 21 March 1727.<br>
