<span class="headword">Reade <span class="st"> [Read]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1606/7&#150;1669), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and civil lawyer</span>, was born at Linkenholt, Hampshire, the second son of Robert Reade (<i>d</i>. 1626?) and his second wife, Mildred (<i>d</i>. 1630/31), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29715/', "Sir Francis Windebank")</script>, Charles I's secretary of state from 1632 to 1640. Thomas was schooled in Hampshire before in 1624, at the king's request, he was awarded a scholarship at New College, Oxford, where he was elected a fellow two years later. Despite his appointment Reade was a recalcitrant student, causing his uncle and the college warden concern both over his feckless behaviour and his religious conformity. After his mother's death (her will is dated 15 August 1630), and the receipt of his inheritance, Reade turned to civil law and graduated BCL on 11 October 1631. Windebank sent his son, John, from Winchester to New College in 1634, to be under Reade's tuition. The warden, Robert Pink, promised to keep a watchful eye over both of them: Reade, he commented, &#145;is very able and to spare&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 230). As late as 1636 Reade had reason to confess to Windebank that, &#145;Evil fate has made him appear Rash and ungrateful&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1636&#150;7</i>, 550). Reade corresponded with his uncle, chiefly in Latin, primarily about John's progress and welfare, until 1638, the year in which John graduated and Reade proceeded DCL.<br>
<br>When the civil war broke out in 1642 Reade proved himself a zealous royalist. He enlisted at Oxford under Captain William Holland, son of Thomas Holland, the regius professor of divinity at Oxford. With a few other doctors and many undergraduates he was drilled in &#145;the parke&#146; of New College and at Christ Church, probably as a pikeman. Reade was appointed to provide for the maintenance of the kings' troop in Oxford, and was ordered to disburse the sum of &pound;5 in the provision of bows and arrows. He was among about 100 other university men who left Oxford on 10 September 1642 attempting to serve as volunteers with Sir John Byron's troops. At Chipping Norton they were waylaid by a troop of horse under John Fiennes, son of Lord Saye and Sele, but Reade escaped to Worcester.<br>
<br>Reade returned to Oxford before 1643, and was admitted, by the king's mandate of 16 October 1643, principal of Magdalen Hall, replacing the parliamentarian Thomas Wilkinson who had already left the university. When Oxford surrendered to parliament in 1646 Wilkinson was restored. A warrant was issued on 7 July 1648 for Reade to be apprehended and brought with his papers and writings before the committee of both houses of parliament; another was issued in February 1649. Reade had gone to Paris before the first warrant was issued. He was received into the Catholic church and entered Douai College, where he took the oath of the profession of faith on 14 May 1648 and that of the alumni on 29 March 1649. He probably entered the Carthusian monastery of Nieuwpoort for some time with the intention of joining the order, but does not seem to have been ordained priest. He wrote in a reply to Edward Boughen's <span class="italic">Account of the Roman Church</span> (1653) in defence of Catholicism. His work was printed in Paris in 1659 under the initials R. T., but no copy seems extant.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Reade returned to London, where he was quietly or clandestinely admitted into the college of advocates on 8 May 1661 &#145;to obtain a bare livelihood&#146; and allowed to live in Doctors' Commons  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.831). He was appointed surrogate to Sir William, judge of the prerogative court of Canterbury. Early in March 1669 he died, aged sixty-two, in poverty at Exeter House on the Strand, where Doctors' Commons had moved after the great fire in 1666. On 7 March he made his deathbed dispositions, &#145;his speech not being Cleare, and he being slowe of utterance&#146;, leaving all that he had to his brother Robert in Paris, &#145;whose purse was open to him and &hellip; he could not have subsisted without him&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/330, fol. 154<i>r</i>). Anthony Wood presumed that Thomas Reade was buried in the church attached to the Savoy Hospital, the parish in which Exeter House lay. Robert Reade was for a time secretary to Sir Francis Windebank.<br>
