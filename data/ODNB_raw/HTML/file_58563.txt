<span class="headword">Gilmore <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Morris]</span>,  Isabella</span>  (1842&#150;1923), <span class="occ">philanthropist and Church of England deaconess</span>, was born on 17 July 1842 at Woodford Hall, Essex, the eighth of the ten children of William Morris (1797&#150;1847), City billbroker with Messrs Sanderson &amp; Co., and his wife, Emma (1805&#150;1894), daughter of Joseph Shelton. Her siblings included, most famously, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19322/', "William Morris (1834&#150;1896)")</script>, artist, poet, and designer, but also Emma (1829&#150;1895), who in 1850 married Joseph Oldham, a former curate of Walthamstow, and Henrietta (1833&#150;1902), who was converted to Catholicism about 1870.<br>
<br>After the death of William Morris senior in 1847, the family moved to Water House, Walthamstow, in 1848, then to Leyton House, Leyton, Essex, in 1856. The Morris children were described as being &#145;most simply brought up&#146; regarding food and clothes but as having a &#145;happy healthy childhood&#146;, ideal &#145;for children with healthy outdoor tastes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Deaconess Gilmore</span>, 1&#150;2). &#145;Issy's&#146; brother Edgar (1844&#150;1924) recalled her as &#145;a bit of a tomboy&#146;  (Edgar Morris to Ada Morris, 1923, Morris family letters, Church of England Record Centre, CWMC/IG/2). By contrast with William Morris's later disparaging remarks about his &#145;bourgeois&#146; home and family religion, Archbishop Randall Davidson claimed in Isabella's memorial sermon that her love for the poor could be traced to &#145;that constant personal communion with our Lord from her early life outward to its close&#146; and to &#145;the unconscious influence of her early days, among what were then regarded as socialistic surroundings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Deaconess Gilmore</span>, 54).<br>
<br>Isabella was educated at home by a governess, went to a private school in Brighton, and then a finishing school in Clifton until the age of seventeen. She &#145;came out&#146; in 1860, and reputedly met her future husband, Lieutenant Arthur Hamilton (Archy) Gilmore RN (1832&#150;1882), at the Beacontree Assembly Rooms, Wanstead. They were married at St Mary's Church, Leyton, on 18 September 1860. On 1 November 1882 Commander Archy Gilmore died of tubercular meningitis at Lyme Regis. They had no children.<br>
<br>In spite of the opposition of her family (except for William and Emma), Isabella trained as a nurse from 1882 to 1886 at Guy's Hospital, where she worked as a ward sister and recalled being &#145;extremely happy&#146;  (&#145;Reminiscences&#146;, 1). After the death of her brother Thomas Rendall (1839&#150;1884) she took on financial and other responsibility for his eight children, aged two upwards, who called her mother, and spent holidays with them where possible.<br>
<br>Victoria Jones, matron of Guy's, who in 1923 described Gilmore as &#145;a very capable nurse and a first-rate sister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Deaconess Gilmore</span>, 6), recommended her in 1886 to Bishop Thorold of Rochester as a suitable person to found a deaconess order in his diocese. Initially reluctant, Gilmore &#145;received the call&#146; on holiday that year. She subsequently worked closely with Thorold to revive the ancient order of deaconesses which existed in the early church, and which had its parallel in the male order of deacons. By contrast to the practice in Anglican sisterhoods and existing deaconess houses, Gilmore believed that the deaconess, once trained, should &#145;owe obedience&#146; only to the bishop and the priest of the parish in which she worked, but could regard the head deaconess as an adviser or friend. Randall Davidson, bishop of Rochester from 1890 to 1896, later recalled that she had been &#145;a trusted counsellor and attached friend&#146; to three successive bishops  (<span class="italic">Deaconess Gilmore</span>, 53): Thorold, himself, and Edward Stuart Talbot.<br>
<br>To oversee the affairs of the institution, Bishop Thorold formed a council, of which he was head, with a warden, secretary, and treasurer. The first deaconess house, where Gilmore was ordained by Bishop Thorold on 16 April 1887, was at 11 Park Hill, Clapham; the second, The Sisters, 83 North Side, Clapham Common, taken in 1891, was extended and altered in 1896 to include a new chapel designed by Philip Webb. The trouble Gilmore expended on the decoration of this and the other two chapels illustrates her love of &#145;gorgeous colour&#146; and fine craftsmanship  (Stirling, 139).<br>
<br>Gilmore was described as &#145;handsome&#146;, when young; when older as having the same pronounced features as her brother William, and an expression both &#145;stern and benevolent&#146;  (Stirling, 139). Although she later recalled how happy she was in her work, she encountered initial opposition, from some clergy, and also from her mother. She considered she was only &#145;lent to the work&#146; until her mother's death in 1894  (&#145;Reminiscences&#146;, 9).<br>
<br>Gilmore wished her deaconesses to be &#145;well-educated gentlewomen&#146;, &#145;widows or virgins&#146;, preferably the former, but not married  (Gilmore, &#145;Deaconesses&#146;, 2). Deaconesses and probationers wore a special (blue) dress, so they could be instantly recognizable, and as a sign of dedication. Trainees had to live in the deaconess institution for three months as visitors, then for one year (later two) as probationers. Finding suitable women was difficult initially, but by the autumn of 1889 there were three, and by 1890, seven. Five were ordained in Southwark Cathedral in 1892, and by 1906 forty-five had been ordained. Although unused to public speaking, Gilmore addressed numerous meetings throughout the diocese explaining the aims of the institution, and recruiting associates, Anglican communicants who were pledged to support the institution through prayer and financially.<br>
<br>Gilmore obtained a reputation for &#145;standing no nonsense&#146;  (&#145;Reminiscences&#146;, 50), which she believed was necessary to deter the wrong kind of applicant. In her view, the essential quality was &#145;absolute devotion to Christ&#146;  (Deaconess Institution, <span class="italic">11th Annual Report, 1897</span>, LPL, 3). Worship, with chapel services, usually taken by Gilmore, held five times daily, was central to the life of the institution. Theological training initially consisted of <span class="roman">Bible</span> study, prayer book, and church history, including written papers, then &#145;Elementary Dogmatics&#146;, added in 1893. From 1898 instruction was given by specialist lectures, with classes in Greek for those who wished.<br>
<br>Gilmore emphasized the importance of visiting the poor in a spirit of friendship, and of offering immediate practical help. Probationers therefore had to become proficient in housework, cooking, and plain sewing, and attend a course of nursing, some of them at Guy's for six months. Parochial visiting with a trained deaconess took place most days in the poorest districts of the Battersea parishes of St Mary's and St John's with St Paul's, then St Peter's. Besides visiting homes and nursing the sick, the deaconesses established a Sunday ragged school, taught in Sunday (and later, day) schools, and took mothers' meetings. Gilmore's practice was to talk about religion where opportunity presented itself, not to try to force the poor to go to church. She arranged baptism services on weekday evenings (the first was attended by ninety-four children) and cottage meetings in poor districts, which deaconesses had to learn to address. Deaconesses also had to liaise with different agencies: the relieving officer, the school attendance officer, the local doctor, local hospitals, and charities.<br>
<br>William Morris reputedly said to Gilmore &#145;I preach socialism&#151;you practise it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Deaconess Gilmore</span>, 37), and other contemporaries were impressed by Gilmore's skill and sympathy in visiting. She recalled that &#145;the people soon became very dear to me and it was agony to find how terrible their condition was&#146;  (&#145;Reminiscences&#146;, 27). She was a member of the first executive of the National Union of Women Workers, established in 1895. However, her concern was with the spiritual as much as the material needs of the poor. While recording that the question of relief was extremely difficult, she established many heavily subsidized forms of philanthropic organization, such as the provision of clothing for small loans, provident clubs, an industrial society, and girls' preventive home (founded in 1893). Deaconesses had to learn simple bookkeeping, and she regarded club-collecting as a useful means of entry into poor homes. She hated alcohol and deaconesses were expected to break up fights.<br>
<br>From 1901 deaconesses had to be over thirty but a system of licensed lay workers, who had the same training, was established. By Gilmore's retirement in 1906 there were many Rochester-trained deaconesses working both overseas and in Britain, such as Helen Barnes, working with the navy, who was based on HMS <i>Pembroke</i> at Chatham from 1895 to 1916. Katherine Beynon did a year's training (1895&#150;6) and then founded St Hilda's Deaconess House, Lahore.<br>
<br>After retiring Gilmore lived with her nieces Ada and (from 1920) Effie at Reigate (until 1914), Kew (until 1921), then Parkstone, Dorset. At the archbishop's request, she wrote a pamphlet called &#145;The deaconess&#146;, which she revised in 1908. She kept in close contact with deaconesses she had trained, addressed numerous conferences, including the women's committee of the Pan-Anglican Congress in 1908, and was consulted by the Association of Head Deaconesses, founded that year. The status of the deaconess order was enshrined in the statutes of the Lambeth conferences of 1920 and 1930.<br>
<br>Isabella Gilmore made a valuable contribution to the work of the Church of England by establishing, in principle and practice, that trained deaconesses and lay workers could work with a parish priest, licensed by the bishop, but independent of any religious community. The Sisters, known as Gilmore House after 1934, remained a training institution until 1970. Arguably, the acceptance of the ordained ministry of deaconesses was an important step towards the eventual admission of women to the Anglican priesthood in November 1992. Gilmore's insistence on rigorous standards in training, and on the independent status of ordained deaconesses, who were paid (her own services were given free), had important implications for the professionalization of women's work from <i>c</i>.1890.<br>
<br>Gilmore died at her home, Kingston, Sandecotes Road, Parkstone, Dorset, on 15 March 1923, of myocardial degeneration and heart failure. Her memorial service, addressed by Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury, was held on 20 March 1923 at Lambeth parish church, and she was buried at St Michael's Church, Lyme Regis, beside her husband, on 21 March. A memorial fund paid for a bas-relief portrait of her in white marble in Southwark Cathedral in 1924; the remainder went towards bursaries for deaconesses.<br>
