<span class="headword">Lynch,  Patrick Edward</span>  (1810&#150;1884), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was one of the eleven sons of Major Henry Blosse Lynch (1778&#150;1823) of Partry House, Ballinrobe, co. Mayo and the 73rd regiment of foot, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1845), daughter of Robert Finnis of Hythe, Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17254/', "Henry Blosse Lynch")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17261/', "Thomas Kerr Lynch")</script> were his brothers. He received a cadetship in 1826, and on 16 February 1827 was posted as ensign to the 16th Bombay native infantry, in which he obtained his subsequent promotions. He was one of the detachment of eight British officers and fourteen NCOs sent to Persia (as part of the British policy to ensure Persia as a buffer against Russia) to support Abbas Mirza. They reached Bushehr in November 1833 and Tehran in March 1834, and were employed under Sir Henry Lindesay Bethune. Lynch commanded a corps at Kisir Chur and the defeat of the Shiraz princes, for which he received the thanks of the shah, the decoration of the Lion and Sun, and the British local rank of major in Persia. The British detachment was withdrawn from service in 1836 to 1837.<br>
<br>Following the British&#150;Indian invasion of Afghanistan (1839) and the restoration of Shah Shuja, in summer 1840 Lieutenant Lynch was appointed political agent in the Ghilzai area of eastern Afghanistan. Apparently ambitious and wanting to increase his own power, he was not an independent arbiter above tribal politics but became involved in them. Following Ghilzai discontent he initiated, without authorization, an aggressive and provocative policy. On 30 April 1841 he attacked a fort 7 miles from Kalat and killed almost all its inhabitants; later, attempting to justify this, he produced stories, apparently unfounded, of conspiracies. According to M. E. Yapp &#145;the evidence suggests that Lynch was deliberately trying to cow the Ghilzays by a demonstration of ruthless force and determination&#146;  (Yapp, 323). He alienated support and in an uprising was besieged at Kalat-i-Ghilzai, and decided to resign. Sir William Macnaghten had already ordered his replacement, and wrote that Lynch was not only imprudent &#145;but a very dangerous character&#146;  (ibid.). He was replaced and his policy reversed.<br>
<br>During the Indian mutiny Lynch served at Belgaum. In 1858 he commanded his regiment with the forces from Aden which captured the stronghold of Sheik Othman, and was mentioned in dispatches. He commanded at Aden and Assurghur, and was brigadier-general at Ahmednagar and Deesa. He became major-general in 1872, and retired with the rank of lieutenant-general in 1878. Lynch married Emily Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1 May 1902), daughter of Captain Sturton of Ersland House, Reigate. They had one son, Colonel Henry Blosse Lynch, Dorset regiment (1856&#150;1936), and five daughters. Lynch died at his seat, Partry House, Ballinrobe, Mayo, on 23 May 1884.<br>
