<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knolles <span class="st"> [Knollys]</span>, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1407), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was probably the son of Richard, who was of burgess or yeoman stock from Tushingham in the parish of Malpas, Cheshire. His mother is frequently named as Eva Calveley, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4407/', "Sir Hugh Calveley")</script>, with whom Robert had a lifelong friendship. But no convincing proof of Eva's existence has ever been found, nor of a family relationship between Robert and Hugh, long professional brothers-in-arms, though their families were associated as early as 1354 when Sir John Wingfield granted Lea manor in Churton Heath, Cheshire, to Mabel Calveley and Henry Newton, chaplain, with remainders in tail to Hugh and David Calveley (both described as &#145;the elder&#146;), and Robert, son of Richard Knolles.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Knolles and Calveley first appear together in arms in documents relating to the siege of La Roche-Derrien in northern Brittany in 1346, when Knolles may have served as an archer under Calveley, probably his senior by a few years. But Knolles was already a knight when next glimpsed, in one of the most notable chivalric feats of the later middle ages, the battle of the Thirty (26 March 1351). This was fought between two teams representing the Anglo-Breton and Franco-Breton forces then disputing the succession to the Breton throne in a civil war that began after the death of Duke John (III) in 1341 without direct heirs. They agreed to joust <i>&agrave; outrance</i>, following a challenge by Jean de Beaumanoir, captain of Josselin, to the English captain of Plo&euml;rmel, whom he accused of mercilessly exploiting the local population. Combatants were killed on both sides and the rest wounded in a bitter contest in which the Anglo-Bretons were vanquished and both Calveley and Knolles made prisoner.<br>
<br>Released shortly afterwards, Knolles soon amassed a considerable personal landed fortune in south-eastern Brittany and neighbouring Mayenne, while acknowledging allegiance to Edward III and his ward, John de Montfort. In February 1352 Edward III confirmed his possession of Le Grand Fougeray, between Nantes and Rennes, which he had recently captured. He also held Ch&acirc;teaublanc (Ille-et-Vilaine) and La Gravelle (Mayenne) through the 1350s. When Gui de Nesle, marshal of France, brought troops in support of Charles de Blois, Montfort's rival, in the summer of 1352, Knolles fought alongside Sir Walter Bentley, Edward's lieutenant in the duchy. At Mauron (Morbihan) on 14 August 1352, a shattering defeat was inflicted on the French by using a combination of dismounted men-at-arms and archers that had already proved effective in the Breton war and at Cr&eacute;cy (1346). Evidence for the moveable wealth Knolles had already amassed from his career is provided by a schedule of plate and other goods, drawn up at Sutton Vautort, Devon, forfeit when Knolles fell temporarily out of favour in 1354, probably for disobeying Bentley's successor, Thomas Holland. In 1355 Edward III also revoked an earlier grant of the castle of Pestivien (C&ocirc;tes-d'Armor).<br>
<br>However, in June 1356 Knolles joined Henry, duke of Lancaster, with 300 men-at-arms and 500 archers drawn from Breton garrisons, contributing a third of Lancaster's force, in a <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> through Normandy in support of Godefroy de Harcourt and Philippe de Navarre that reached as far as Verneuil, before returning to base at the abbey of Montebourg in the Cotentin. Skirmishing around Rouen and a siege of Domfront followed. But Lancaster failed to link up with Edward, prince of Wales, who had launched his own famous raid from Bordeaux that culminated in the battle of Poitiers, from which Knolles, unable to cross the Loire, was also absent, despite some reports to the contrary.<br>
<br>Knolles's next campaign with Lancaster was an unsuccessful siege of Rennes (October 1356&#150;June 1357). When this was lifted, he led an attack on Honfleur in Normandy with Sir James Pipe, where according to the chronicler Henry Knighton, with some 600 men, they defeated Robert de Clermont, marshal of France, with 800 men-at-arms and 5000 infantry, killing at least 500, while another surprise attack resulted in the slaughter of a further 1000 Frenchmen. Whatever the exact figures or circumstances (much embroidered by chroniclers, who also mention Knolles at a siege of Dinan), it is in these years that he gained his reputation as &#145;the most able and skilful man of arms in all the companies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chroniques de J. Froissart</span>, 5.366), cool, calculating, knowing when to retreat but striking with terrible effect.<h2>
<a name="KnollesintheOrlannaisandAuvergne13581359"></a>Knolles in the Orl&eacute;annais and Auvergne, 1358&#150;1359</h2>Knolles's reputation as &#145;a true demon of war&#146;  (Bridges, 178) was most spectacularly demonstrated in a great raid into the Orl&eacute;annais and upper Loire region in autumn 1358 when he ostentatiously displayed a banner announcing:<blockquote>
<div>Qui Robert Canolle prendera,<br>
</div>
<div>Cent mille moutons gagnera.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Chroniques de J. Froissart</span>, 5.351)</blockquote>He burnt the suburbs of Orl&eacute;ans, and, establishing himself at Ch&acirc;teauneuf-sur-Loire, ravaged the Auxerrois where numerous other English garrisons were living off the countryside, as they had been doing in Brittany and Normandy for years, and where the charred gables marking his progress became known as &#145;Knolles's mitres&#146;. A first attack on Auxerre in January 1359 was repulsed, but on 10 March 1359 the town was delivered to him, despite the presence of a garrison under the renowned <i>routier</i> Arnaud de Cervole (the Archpriest). Among Knolles's companions on this occasion was Sir Thomas Fogg; he was later joined by Ieuan Wyn, known as the Poursuivant d'Amour, a famous Welsh mercenary, and by Calveley. On 30 April the Auxerrois agreed to pay 40,000 moutons and hand over pearls worth a further 10,000 moutons (approximately &pound;10,000 in total) to be rid of Knolles.<br>
<br>Knolles now turned his attentions to the Auvergne, after apparently abandoning even more ambitious plans to attack the Comtat Venaissin, where Pope Innocent VI and his cardinals became highly alarmed at his progress when he was allegedly within twelve leagues of Avignon. Using Pont-du-Ch&acirc;teau as he had previously exploited Ch&acirc;teauneuf, Knolles raided widely in the Auvergne, taking Cusset, attacking St Pour&ccedil;ain, and even moving on Le Puy. On 25 June 1359 the townsmen of Millau in the Rouergue received letters warning them of his approach. But a counter-attack led by Thomas de la Marche, deputy of the dauphin, Charles, regent of France during the absence in prison of his father, Jean II, following his capture at Poitiers, forced a retreat after some captains accompanying Knolles went off independently. Burning Montbrison and sacking churches and abbeys around St &Eacute;tienne, Knolles then began a staged withdrawal in which he was joined by Calveley, who had been fighting with other Anglo-Navarrese forces on the borders of Burgundy. Knolles passed through Limoges, and by the autumn was back in Brittany where he captured the future constable of France, Bertrand du Guesclin, who was establishing his own formidable credentials as a captain by similarly ruthless means.<br>
<br>The treaty of Br&eacute;tigny&#150;Calais (May&#150;October 1360) brought the first phase of the Hundred Years' War to a close and temporarily restricted opportunities for freebooters like Knolles. He was confirmed in possession of his French estates, visited England, obtained a pardon for any crimes committed abroad, sat in the court of chivalry, and regularized the payments he owed Edward III for his castles in France. But by October 1361 he was clearly tired of inactivity since he is reported fighting in Savoy, <i>en route</i> for Italy with Sir John Hawkwood and Annechin de Bongarden, though little appears to be known about his actions there. By 1363 he was back in Brittany, serving at the relief of B&eacute;cherel in June, and accompanying John de Montfort to Poitiers in November, when the prince of Wales tried to negotiate a peaceful end to the Breton civil war by bringing the two rivals together. When discussions finally broke down in February 1364, following another meeting at Poitiers attended by Knolles, preparations began for the inevitable military campaign that was to follow. In March 1364, Montfort conferred on him the lordships of Derval and Roug&eacute; (Loire-Atlantique), whose rightful owner had been a prisoner since the battle of Poitiers. As the Breton rivals manoeuvred for advantage in the summer, Knolles brought a force of 900 or 1000 men to Montfort's siege of Auray (Morbihan). He then fought, under the overall command of Sir John Chandos, in the vanguard of the Anglo-Breton army, which inflicted a crushing defeat on Charles de Blois as he attempted to lift the siege. Blois himself was killed on the field (29 September 1364) and Knolles took several prisoners, including the count of Auxerre. In April 1365, by the first treaty of Gu&eacute;rande, Charles V finally acknowledged John de Montfort as duke of Brittany.<h2>
<a name="Middleyears"></a>Middle years</h2>With his wife, Constance, to whom he was married by 1355, and who hailed from Yorkshire, though she had spent much of the previous decade in Brittany, whence she sometimes personally led small contingents of English troops, Knolles briefly settled down to enjoy his Breton estates and his prominent position at the ducal court. In 1365 he negotiated the return of La Gravelle, Segr&eacute;, and Ingrande (Mayenne) to Amaury de Craon for 10,000 livres and arranged an exchange of Ch&acirc;teaublanc and Fougeray with John de Montfort for an annual rent of 2000 livres on the lordships of Conq (Concarneau) and Rosporden (Finist&egrave;re), though he retained Derval and Roug&eacute;, which should have returned to their lord under the treaty of Gu&eacute;rande, despite his protests. Knolles was, however, forced to disgorge some profits from the raid of 1358&#150;9, in his search for respectability and social acceptance, by repaying some of the 40,000 moutons Auxerre had agreed to pay, in exchange for a papal pardon. On 4 August 1366 the abbot of St Aubin d'Angers was ordered to return jewels, relics, and other goods which he had deposited at the abbey to St Germain d'Auxerre.<br>
<br>Early in 1367 Edward, the Black Prince, summoned Knolles to join his expedition to Spain in support of Pedro the Cruel of Castile. After crossing the Pyrenees via Roncevalles, he reconnoitred around Navaretta in February and March with Sir William Felton. But he escaped the skirmish in which Felton was killed and fought on the left wing at N&aacute;jera (3 April 1367), before returning to Brittany. At Candlemas 1368 he was at Dinan (C&ocirc;tes-d'Armor) when, in a celebrated incident, John de Montfort's efforts to expunge a painting of his late rival, Blois, from the walls of the Dominican friary resulted in an apparently miraculous occurrence, as drops of blood seeped through whitewash used to obliterate the image. Witnesses later recalled that Knolles (who, according to the Chandos herald, was a man of few words), berated those collecting the liquid for their credulity: &#145;Countryfolk and villeins, do you believe he was a saint? By St George, you lie, you idiots! He was no saint!&#146;  (Plaine and Serent, 283). In March 1368 Knolles had a further protection to come to England with his wife and an entourage of sixty persons. From this period he began acquiring manors in Norfolk where he eventually retired. At the same time, he also cast envious eyes on an even more prestigious lordship, the <i>vicomt&eacute;</i> of Limoges, held by the widow of Charles de Blois, but at the time still under the Black Prince's dominion, which he attempted to purchase.<br>
<br>At the end of 1368 Knolles was again campaigning in the Rouergue. After bringing reinforcements from Brittany in the spring of 1369, he waged war in the Cahorsin between May and July, besieging Domme and attacking Rocamadour and Villefranche, before joining the earls of Cambridge and Pembroke in Poitou. He was at the Black Prince's court at Angoul&ecirc;me in January 1370 and at the relief of Belleperche, before returning once more to Derval, from whence he was summoned to England by Edward III.<h2>
<a name="Theexpeditionof1370"></a>The expedition of 1370</h2>Since the reopening of the war with France in 1369, the English had recorded no major successes. It was decided early in 1370 that a large expedition should be launched which for the first time was to be commanded by a captain below the rank of earl. It was for this task that Knolles was chosen. The original intention seems to have been to give him sole charge of a force to invade Normandy in June and link up with Charles II of Navarre, with whom negotiations were in train. But delays and growing criticism of the decision to appoint Knolles to such a high command forced a change of plan. This had disastrous consequences. On 13 June Knolles agreed terms with Sir Alan Buxhull, Sir Thomas Grandison, and Sir John Bourchier, who were now to share command with him, over the division of their expected profits. On 20 June Knolles sealed an indenture to serve with 2000 men-at-arms and 2000 archers for two years, with permission to fight anywhere in France outside Aquitaine. On 5 July he appeared before the king's council to agree these terms, as the other captains did in the next few days. Ships (under John, Lord Neville, and the admiral, Ralph Ferrers), troops, and supplies had been gathering for some weeks and by 22 July, Knolles, his men, and horses (some 8464 in total), were ready to set out from Calais, having crossed from Winchelsea and Rye.<br>
<br>Spreading out into smaller bands and marching in roughly parallel lines, Knolles's troops pillaged their way through Picardy, Champagne, and the &Icirc;le-de-France into Normandy, the Chartrain, the Vend&ocirc;mois, and Maine in the next five months, inflicting much superficial damage but avoiding sieges of major strong points, for instance, bypassing Rheims and Paris, though Knolles tried on several occasions to offer battle. By the autumn disagreements among the commanders, all of whom felt socially superior to Knolles, and, in the case of Sir John Minsterworth (who called Knolles &#145;an old brigand&#146;), even hints of treasonable communication with the enemy, together led to a complete breakdown in discipline and the disintegration of the army. Knolles himself eventually found refuge at his castle of Derval, some men later returning to England from western Breton ports, while another division, under Thomas Grandison, after hot pursuit, was finally defeated by du Guesclin at Pontvallain, 30 kilometres south of Le Mans, on 4 December 1370. For the first time, the French army had effectively employed the Fabian tactics that allowed Charles V in the next few years to regain most of the territory lost before 1360: it had shadowed the invading force, picked off stragglers, and avoided full-scale battle by withdrawing to well-defended towns whenever the English approached.<br>
<br>In the recriminations that followed this disaster (for a time it was believed that Knolles had perished, and his attempt to assuage Edward III with a large sum of money was foiled when most of it was embezzled by William, Lord Latimer), Edward III seized Knolles's properties in England. For several years he was out of favour, serving the Black Prince in Gascony or guarding his interests in Brittany. However, worsening relations between John de Montfort and his nobility placed these in jeopardy and in May 1373 Charles V declared the lordships of Roug&eacute; and Derval forfeit after du Guesclin had overrun all the duchy except Brest Castle. Here Knolles was captain for Montfort, who had fled into exile in England. He was besieged in June; terms and hostages for the delivery of Brest to du Guesclin were agreed in July, but aid provided by the earl of Salisbury, cruising in the channel, allowed Knolles to renege. He also disavowed a similar agreement by his lieutenant, Hugh Browe, to deliver Derval to the French in the autumn though, unlike Brest, it did eventually fall in 1374. Knolles also gained more experience of naval warfare: Walsingham reports him attacking Spanish shipping off Sluys in 1374; a ship owned by him was lost off Purbeck while carrying his goods from Plymouth to London in 1371; and in autumn 1377 he was in the fleet sent to the relief of Brest under Thomas of Woodstock, earl of Buckingham.<br>
<br>On land, Knolles campaigned in the Cotentin in June 1374 where the English still held St Sauveur-le-Vicomte, shortly before it was besieged by the admiral of France, Jean de Vienne, though it resisted for almost a year before falling. Knolles may also have fought around Niort (Deux-S&egrave;vres) in this period, finally receiving a full pardon for the expedition of 1370. He continued to consolidate his English estates, investing not only in rural properties in Norfolk, Kent, and Wiltshire, but establishing strong links with leading citizens of London, where he acquired extensive possessions, including the manor of St Pancras and houses and shops in Islington, Kentish Town, and the parishes of All Hallows Barking, and St Giles Cripplegate.<br>
<br>During the Anglo-French truces of 1374&#150;7 Knolles acted as a conservator, and was involved both as a defendant and as a commissioner in further court of chivalry cases. But as soon as the truces expired, he was to the fore in military affairs. He was appointed captain of Brest once more in January 1378, from where he attacked John de Montfort's domestic enemies. He continued in office for a short period after the duke agreed to deliver the castle officially into English keeping in April 1378, but was replaced in June 1378, only to raid Harfleur with Richard (III) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel, and then accompany John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, in his siege of St Malo in August. If not already one of Gaunt's retainers, Knolles subsequently received an annual fee from him as he had from the Black Prince. A domestic moment is revealed about 1 October 1378, when he dined congenially with John de Montfort at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, one of the manors that Richard II had delivered in exchange for Brest. In February 1379 Knolles was appointed along with Sir John Cobham, Robert Bealknap, and others, including Sir Thomas Fogg and Sir John Devereux, with whom he had frequently campaigned in France, to guard the coasts of Kent. He went back to Brittany with Montfort in the summer, when the Breton nobility suddenly relented and asked the duke to return to his throne. After returning to England in 1380, he was retained as one of Buckingham's captains for another great <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i>, with a retinue of 140 men-at-arms and 240 archers. They left Calais almost exactly ten years to the day after the expedition of 1370.<br>
<br>Buckingham's army took an almost identical route to that of 1370 through northern-eastern France, before sweeping westwards around Paris, reaching Nantes in October. Here a siege was laid on behalf of John de Montfort against his most stubborn domestic opponent, Olivier, lord of Clisson, who had just succeeded du Guesclin as constable of France, following the latter's death in July 1380. The siege was long and ultimately unsuccessful, with winter weather causing much sickness among the besiegers. There was also growing tension between Montfort and his English allies, as he secretly negotiated terms with the French, finally ratified in the second treaty of Gu&eacute;rande in April 1381. To pacify Buckingham and his lieutenants, who reluctantly agreed to return to England, Montfort had to make substantial payments, though it is not clear what Knolles's share was. He was back in England, however, in time to take a characteristically robust part in suppressing the peasants' revolt. In order to disperse the mob, one chronicler reports that Knolles counselled Richard II to issue a proclamation on 13 June stating that Gaunt (who had been in Scotland on a diplomatic mission) was approaching London with a large force, while on 14 June Knolles was with the king at Mile End, when he met the rebels. On 15 June, after William Walworth killed Wat Tyler in Richard's presence at Smithfield, Knolles brought soldiers whom he had been gathering in the city to surround the leaderless rebels, a move that appears carefully co-ordinated with Walworth's actions, though Richard succeeded in persuading them to disperse without the need for Knolles to exercise force. This timely service earned Knolles the freedom of the city, a title he proudly boasted in his wills, as well as other rewards. There was one final campaign in 1383 with Bishop Despenser to Flanders, though he was appointed to later commissions for the defence of the realm, as in 1385 when he is reported gathering troops at Sandwich. Following his experience of pacifying London in 1381, he helped suppress a riot there in 1384, and at the time of the Merciless Parliament a faction, led by Nicholas Exton, wanted to appoint him captain of the city, but his fighting days were over.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>War had made Knolles a wealthy man. Much booty inevitably passed quickly through his hands as larders and cellars were looted, food and wine consumed, and material possessions generously shared with his own men or even, in the case of Auxerre, returned to their owners. But Knolles also proved astute not only in converting some gains into real estate but in lending specie and increasing his liquid assets. It is impossible to draw an exact balance sheet. Most payments to him concern military service, for which confusing pledges and assignments were made by the crown. Many of these could not be honoured. This led to much complex bargaining and rescheduling of debts. But from the early 1370s Knolles increasingly developed mercantile interests and lent money to private individuals as well as to the crown. In 1382, for example, Richard II acknowledged loans totalling &pound;6888; and it may have been through his contacts in the city that a presumed relative, Thomas Knolles (<i>d</i>. 1435), one of Robert's executors, was able to make a highly successful career as a grocer and citizen who was twice mayor of London.<br>
<br>After 1381, with advancing years, Knolles's attentions turned more obviously to charitable and religious foundations. The traditional view (derived from Stow) that he helped establish an English hospital at Rome with Calveley and Hawkwood is now discounted, but he did receive a licence in 1389 to visit &#145;the Roman court for the quieting of his conscience&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 7.641). His two chief concerns were rebuilding the bridge over the Medway at Rochester, with its associated chapel, an enterprise taken in hand with John, third Lord Cobham by March 1388 and completed in the 1390s, and founding a college at Pontefract, the probable birthplace of his wife. In this he was following a fashion set by other old soldiers&#151;Sir Walter Mauny's patronage of the London Charterhouse, Sir Nicholas Cantilupe's establishment of Beauvale Priory, Nottinghamshire, or Calveley's own foundation of a collegiate church at Bunbury, Cheshire, under a will which Knolles executed&#151;and reflecting an ascetic piety shared with other members of Gaunt's retinue. In 1385 Richard II confirmed Knolles's plans for a chantry at Pontefract, staffed by a warden and six priests, with an almshouse for thirteen poor persons. After Constance's own death (<i>c</i>.1389), he paid a further fine of &pound;240 for another royal confirmation, and bestowed on it a wealth of vestments and chapel furnishings (some possibly loot) as well as 1000 marks in cash under his second will (1404). The college was dissolved at the Reformation, but Knolles's Almshouses survived until 1881, when their endowments were reinvested with others to fund the still flourishing Pontefract Charities. At Rochester the new bridge served until 1856, before being replaced. But the chapel, dissolved in 1548, was saved. After restoration in the 1930s, it now provides a boardroom for the wardens of the Rochester Bridge Trust, with the arms of Cobham and Knolles displayed in its east window.<br>
<br>Following his death on 15 August 1407 at Sculthorpe, his chief Norfolk manor, Knolles, a small but physically powerful man, was commemorated by Walsingham as &#145;a most invincible knight, whose arms the kingdom of France had felt against it for many years, the duchy of Brittany feared, and the lands of the Spaniards dreaded&#146;  (<span class="italic">St Albans Chronicle</span>, 22). The most famous English professional soldier of the Hundred Years' War, he was described by the same author as &#145;a poor and humble valet [who rose to be] a great leader of soldiers, possessed of regal riches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 1.286), yet he was buried with little pomp at the Whitefriars, London, alongside his wife. Knolles left a huge range of bequests to household servants and churches in London and elsewhere, including &pound;5 to Malpas parish church. In earlier years Constance accompanied him with their &#145;boys&#146; on his expeditions. None survived their parents; a son, who died young, was buried in the abbey of Pri&egrave;res (Morbihan), about 1360. Since there were no direct heirs, the residue of his estate was settled on the college at Pontefract, while Knolles's fame was preserved by the display of his arms in several Norfolk churches (some of which, like Harpley and Sculthorpe, he rebuilt) and on other monuments that reflect family ties and friendships, like the tombs of Calveley at Bunbury and Thomas Knolles at North Mimms, Hertfordshire, or Bodiam Castle, Sussex, the home of Sir Edward Dallingridge, while a boss in the cloisters of Norwich Cathedral portrays Robert and Constance at prayer, flanking a representation of the Trinity.<br>
