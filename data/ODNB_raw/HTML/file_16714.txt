<span class="headword">Lindsay,  Patrick</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1686, <em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 10 March 1686. He was descended from a younger branch of the Lindsays of Kirkforthar, Fife, and was the only surviving son of Patrick Lindsay, rector of St Andrews grammar school, and Janet, only daughter of John Lindsay of Newton. He served with Sir Robert Riche's infantry regiment in Spain until the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. On 22 June 1715 he married Margaret, daughter of David Monteir, an Edinburgh merchant. They had three sons and two daughters: Patrick, appointed deputy secretary at war in 1741; John, a lieutenant-colonel in the army; James, a merchant navy officer; Mary, who was unmarried; and Janet, who married James Anderson of Monthrieve, Fife.<br>
<br>Lindsay appears to have learned the same trade as his grandfather, a joiner in St Andrews, for after leaving the army he became an upholsterer in Edinburgh. He prospered in his business, and was granted the freedom of the city of St Andrews (10 September 1722) and chosen a magistrate of Edinburgh. He became successively dean of guild and lord provost, holding the latter office twice (1729&#150;31 and 1733&#150;5). During his first term he tried (26 October 1730) and hanged two men who had murdered his apprentice during a burglary at his upholstery shop (15 August 1728). At this time he published <span class="italic">The Interest of Scotland &hellip; with Reference to its Police, Agriculture, Trade, Manufacture and Fishery</span> (1733). In 1734 he was elected MP for Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Ilay, and held his seat until 1741.<br>
<br>During the Porteous riots in 1736 he was charged with passing a request for assistance from the Edinburgh magistrates to the commander of the troops, General Moyle. The request was not met because, in Moyle's opinion, Lindsay was drunk at their meeting. In May 1737 Lindsay spoke against a bill to disfranchise Edinburgh as a result of the riot, but his attack on the local clergy for their part in the disturbances won him few friends in the city.<br>
<br>In November 1739 Lindsay's second wife, Janet, daughter of James Murray of Polton, died, and on 7 May 1741 he married Lady Catherine Lindsay, daughter of William, eighteenth earl of Crawford; neither marriage produced children. After retiring from the representation of the city he was in 1747 appointed governor of the Isle of Man by the duke of Atholl. On account of indisposition Lindsay resigned the office some time before his death, which took place at the Canongate, Edinburgh, on 20 February 1753.<br>
