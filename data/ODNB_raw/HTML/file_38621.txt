<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zimmern,  Alice Louisa Theodora</span>  (1855&#150;1939), <span class="occ">educationist and suffragist</span>, was born on 22 September 1855 at Postern Street, Nottingham, the youngest of three daughters of Hermann Theodor Zimmern, a German Jewish immigrant with scholarly interests who was in business as a lace merchant, and his wife, Antonia Marie Therese Regina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leo. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55284/', "Helen Zimmern")</script> was her elder sister and they collaborated in compiling two volumes of translations (1880, 1884) from the works of European novelists designed to interest English readers in the cultures of continental Europe. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37088/', "Alfred Eckhard Zimmern")</script>, the authority on international relations, was her cousin. Alice was educated at a private school, then at Bedford College, London, before being admitted to Girton College, Cambridge, in 1881. Like other Girton students of the time, Zimmern found her years at university offered an incomparable opportunity for intellectual expansion and freedom. With Janet Case she organized a society to produce classical drama which resulted, most notably, in the 1883 college production of <span class="italic">Elektra</span>, &#145;breaking down&#146;, as Virginia Woolf noted, &#145;the tradition that only men acted in the Greek play&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Jan 1934).<br>
<br>After leaving Girton in 1885, having gained honours in both parts of the Cambridge classical tripos, Zimmern held teaching posts in classics and English at girls' schools between 1886 and 1894. She was an assistant mistress at Tunbridge Wells high school from 1888 to 1891. For school use she produced an edition of the <span class="italic">Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</span> (1887) and a translation, entitled <span class="italic">The Home Life of the Ancient Greeks</span> (1893), from Hugo Bluemner's German, which she later followed with children's books on ancient Greece and Rome (1895, 1906). In 1893, with four other women educators, she was awarded a Gilchrist travelling scholarship which required her to study educational methods in the United States with particular reference to the training of girls. Her <span class="italic">Methods of Education in America</span> (1894) reflects Zimmern's interest in a less rigid system of education. She was particularly impressed with the way in which American children were more articulate in discussion and how the American methods of teaching literature inspired &#145;a real living love for our own English classics&#146; which was almost unknown in English schools because of the overemphasis on exams. At the same time she deplored the low quality of American students' written work, the inanity of many of their textbooks, and the ludicrously &#145;over-patriotic&#146; way of teaching American history.<br>
<br>In 1894 Zimmern resigned her school position, though she continued to teach classics to private pupils to supplement her small private income. In the years that followed she contributed numerous articles to journals such as <span class="italic">Forum</span> and the <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span>, comparing different education systems she observed in her travels, and, increasingly, reflecting on the education of women. In <span class="italic">Women's Suffrage in Many Lands</span> (1909), written to coincide with the Fourth Congress of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, Zimmern finds a number of historical precedents for women's entitlement to the franchise and makes the argument that granting women the vote would be, in some cases, merely reinstating a previously held right. More importantly she shows, through a wide range of examples from different countries, that there is an &#145;intimate &hellip; connexion between enfranchisement and the just treatment of women&#146;. While most of the arguments she presents are moderate and pragmatic, she readily acknowledges the militant tactics of British suffragettes as effective in making women's suffrage &#145;the question of the day&#146;.<br>
<br>Both Zimmern's <span class="italic">The Renaissance of Girls' Education</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Women's Suffrage in Many Lands</span> made a major contribution to contemporary debates about the education and political rights of women. In numerous articles she also offered insight into the material conditions which defined the quality of women's lives. &#145;Ladies' clubs in London&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Forum</span> (1896), and &#145;Ladies' dwellings&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> (1900), show all too clearly that the opportunity offered by Girton to young women &#145;to carry on their studies in congenial and stimulating surroundings, unhampered by cares of earning and unhindered by conflicting duties&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Renaissance of Girls' Education</span>, 104&#150;5) was one which would never be replicated in later life.<br>
<br>Zimmern's ability to travel widely was increasingly limited by arthritis in the last decades of her life, though she continued to entertain many international visitors with feminist and pacifist interests in her Hampstead flat. Her last publication, a translation of Tak&eacute; Ionescu's work, was <span class="italic">The Origins of the War</span> (1917), published by the Council for the Study of International Relations. Alice Zimmern, who was unmarried, died at her home, 45 Clevedon Mansions, Highgate Road, London, on 22 March 1939, and was buried on 25 March at Kentish Town parish church. She was representative of a distinguished generation of Girtonians who made important contributions to the women's movement.<br>
