<span class="headword">Marsh,  Alphonso</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 28 January 1627, was the son of Robert Marsh, one of the royal musicians to Charles I. Alphonso Marsh was married twice; his first wife, Mary Cheston, whom he married on 8 February 1648, was probably the mother of his two children, Elizabeth and <a href="#cosubject_18105">Alphonso [<i>see below</i>]</a>. His second wife, Rebecca, outlived him. Following his father into royal service as a musician, Marsh was appointed to the king's musick in the voices and lutes on 20 June 1660 in the place of a deceased singer for &pound;40 per year plus livery costs. Marsh's salary fell in the middle of the salary range for royal musicians. As a member of the Chapel Royal he sometimes accompanied the king on progress, for example joining the royal household in Oxford when it escaped the plague in 1665&#150;6. Samuel Pepys was not impressed with Marsh's voice; after an evening outing on 19 August 1661 Pepys commented that his &#145;voice is quite lost&#146;. However, the condition of Marsh's voice was probably affected by the alcohol Pepys had been buying during the evening  (Pepys, 2.158).<br>
<br>Marsh is a good example of two features of the king's musick: dynasties and problems with payment. The Marshes were not the only family that provided the royal household with several generations of musicians; others included the Laniers, the Bassanos, and the Strongs. Alphonso also experienced the Restoration court's inability to pay its servants in a timely manner. In his will, Marsh left his widow, Rebecca, two-thirds of his court arrears and his son one-third. Three years after her husband's death, Rebecca Marsh was still owed &pound;10 from his arrears.<br>
<br>Marsh experienced some opposition to his status as a royal musician. In November 1668 he obtained a warrant to arrest several local musicians who had assaulted him and defamed the special status royal musicians enjoyed. These privileges included exemption from the subsidy assigned in 1662. Marsh also was a member of the Corporation for Regulating the Art and Science of Music, a guild begun by royal musicians in the early seventeenth century to regulate the performance and teaching of music in the capital. However, the corporation closed in 1679 because it could not force local musicians to adhere to its regulations and was unable to collect dues from members, many of whom suffered from the crown's inability to pay its servants on time.<br>
<br>Marsh wrote music for several theatrical productions: Sir William Davenant's <span class="italic">Law Against Lovers</span> (1662), John Dryden's <span class="italic">An Evening's Love</span> (1668), part 1 of Dryden's <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span> (1673), and Thomas Duffett's <span class="italic">The Spanish Rogue</span> (1673). He was also a regular contributor to John Playford's musical publications, including his series <span class="italic">Choice Ayres, Songs, &amp; Dialogues</span> in the 1670s and books such as <span class="italic">The Treasury of Musick</span> (1669). Some material also survives in manuscript form (BL, Harley MS 1911 and TNA: PRO, LC9/195&#150;200). Marsh was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 2 May 1681.<br>
<br>Marsh's son, <a name="cosubject_18105"></a><span class="headword">Alphonso Marsh</span>  (1648&#150;1692), was also a <span class="occ">royal musician and composer</span> and performed alongside his father for many years. A tenor, the younger Marsh, who was married to Cicilia (<i>d</i>. 1690/91), was sworn on 25 April 1676 into Charles II's service and had to be readmitted into the royal household after taking the oath of allegiance to William and Mary in July 1689. Father and son performed on stage together in Crowne's masque <span class="italic">Calisto</span> at Whitehall in 1675, the father receiving &pound;10 and the son, who performed Africa in the prologue, &pound;5, sizeable payments compared with their salaries. Alphonso the younger also contributed songs to John Playford's series <span class="italic">Choice Ayres, Songs, &amp; Dialogues</span>. Marsh died on 5 April 1692 and was buried in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey.<br>
