<span class="headword">Costa,  Alvaro Jacob <span class="st"> [Alvaro Rodrigues]</span>  da</span>  (1646&#150;1716), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Lisbon, the only child of Fern&atilde;o Mendes da Costa (1608&#150;1670), an important New Christian merchant and government official from Trancoso, Beira Alta, Portugal. He was the son of his father's first marriage to Brites da Costa, daughter of Alvaro Rodrigues of Elvas. His father, widowed twice, was suspected, together with his third wife, Branca Rodrigues, of judaizing; Branca was finally condemned at the Lisbon <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> of 14 April 1666 and probably burnt at the stake. Fern&atilde;o fled to London in 1662 or earlier with his son Alvaro, then a youth and reputedly a page-boy to Catherine of Braganza. In a list of good Catholics, Fern&atilde;o is referred to as &#145;forced to leave Portugal for fear of the Inquisition and living in London&#146;  (Samuel, 1961, 42, n. 26); as such, he may well, as Samuel suggests, have been associated with Duarte da Silva in handling the dowry of Catherine of Braganza in 1662. He certainly arrived with substantial funds. The ledgers of Alderman Edward Backwell, goldsmith and banker, show for 1663 accounts in Fern&atilde;o's name with a turnover of &pound;30,490, and he was able to buy a huge quantity of pepper at an East India Company sale.<br>
<br>Da Costa himself is frequently referred to as the founding father of the Anglo-Sephardi community in London, though neither he nor his father was ever a professing Jew in the usual sense of the term. He remained uncircumcised, never figured in the synagogal records, and in his will of 1710 did not leave money for alms-giving to the synagogue, or ask to be buried in the Jewish burial-ground at Mile End. Indeed, he continued to profess Christianity, perhaps because initially he hoped to return to Portugal, perhaps from religious indifference or cynicism, and certainly through self-interest. As a Christian he could and did become a naturalized Englishman&#151;the first Jew to do so&#151;on 30 October 1667, as soon as he attained his majority, taking the sacrament as required, and swearing the prescribed Christological oaths of allegiance and supremacy.<br>
<br>Da Costa was admitted, on 5 August 1668, as a freeman of the East India Company, again taking the Christological oaths, and now in a position to promote his own, his family's, and his friends' mercantile interests. Chief among these was the import of diamonds from India. As well as cotton stuffs from there, he imported brazilwood from the Azores, and exported a variety of goods, such as coral from Italy to India, essential as a trade for diamonds, and hats, woollen cloth, and stockings for the South American trade via Lisbon, Seville, and the Canaries. He and his associates (principally his first cousins, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18553/', "Dr Fernando Moses Mendes (1647&#150;1724)")</script> and John Joseph Mendes da Costa (1655&#150;1726), two other founding fathers of the Anglo-Sephardi community) acted as brokers for customers in Antwerp, Amsterdam, Paris, and other European centres, and were involved in shipments of bullion, thus moving from trade to finance. Da Costa dominated Jewish mercantile activities in the City of London for the next thirty years; he was, for instance, one of the two largest individual London importers of diamonds from 1669 to the end of the century. Despite the fact that he had certainly been baptized in Lisbon, as a young man of twenty-six he received adult baptism on 9 October 1672 at St Katharine by the Tower, thus confirming his allegiance to the established church, and parrying any charge of popery. He appears in the court books of the East India Company, buying and selling stock and having his knuckles rapped on occasion for allowing his name to be used by non-freemen (&#145;interlopers&#146;) to avoid paying dues. He was one of the first Jews to subscribe to Bank of England stock (7 December 1696).<br>
<br>As a naturalized Englishman, da Costa could hold absolute title to land, and was the first Jew to do so. In 1675 he bought a house on Highgate Hill (later known as Cromwell House), which he shared with his cousins, and in 1677 bought a house in Budge Row in the City. In 1667 he married his cousin, Leonor Mendes Guti&eacute;rres (1651&#150;1727). Their three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39728/', "Anthony Moses da Costa")</script>, John Benjamin da Costa (1674&#150;1752), and Fernando Joseph da Costa (1683&#150;1753) were in their turn noted merchants; all were professing Jews, although Anthony was baptized on 12 January 1679. Da Costa died in early February 1716 and was, despite all, buried in the Jewish burial-ground at Mile End. His religious beliefs remain a mystery. Although Hyamson and others see him as a pillar of Anglo-Jewry, the evidence is against this. His ties with the Portuguese Jewish community seem to be based on ethnic identity and family solidarity rather than on any religious beliefs or practices.<br>
