<span class="headword">Crawford,  William</span>  (1833&#150;1890), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Whitley in Northumberland, the son of William Crawford, a miner. Little is known of his early years, except that he suffered a serious injury when sent to work in the pits at about the age of ten. Doctors wanted to amputate his leg but his father refused. He was able to attend Seaton Sluice School during convalescence and as a result was somewhat better educated than most miners' sons. At the age of twenty-four, when he married Sarah Ann, daughter of John Townson of Tamworth, he was already a Primitive Methodist preacher and an advocate of temperance and social reform.<br>
<br>By the early 1860s Crawford was an active trade unionist, and in 1863 he played a key role in the formation of the Northumberland and Durham Mutual Confident Association. Towards the end of that year colliery owners threatened to reintroduce the yearly bond (or contractual arrangement) into Northumberland but met with stern resistance from the pitmen. Spurred by the thought of collective strength the pitmen agreed to form a union at the end of December; Crawford was elected general secretary. The union was much stronger in Northumberland than in Durham and Crawford worked with considerable success to encourage interest in unionization in the Auckland district of Durham. In the same year, 1863, he was nominated as delegate to the famous conference of the National Association of Coal, Lime, and Ironstone Miners. There he argued the case for improved inspection of mines, but urged rejection of the proposal for an eight-hour bill in mining. Crawford was vehemently opposed to the disruption of working practices in the region which would be entailed by limiting the hours worked by boys.<br>
<br>In 1864 the Northumberland miners seceded from the joint association, and this led to a campaign by Durham miners to establish their own trade union. Crawford remained secretary and agent of the Northumberland Association until June 1865 when he became secretary of the Cowpen co-operative store at Blyth, Northumberland. He was succeeded in the union by Thomas Burt. Earlier in the same year, shortly before leaving the Northumberland union, Crawford gave evidence before the select committee on the regulation and inspection of mines and miners' complaints. He worked for about a year for his co-operative society and then began business on his own account at Bedlington.<br>
<br>The creation of the Durham Miners' Association (DMA) in 1869 was to prove pivotal to Crawford's future career. In Durham as in Northumberland, miners were becoming increasingly aware of their common problems and the possibility of finding solutions in united action. They shared a common detestation of the yearly bond and the realization of the need to protect their rates of pay and conditions of work. The issue came to a head at Monkwearmouth colliery in 1869 when four men were charged before the courts for breach of contract. They had signed the &#145;bond&#146; but had then withdrawn their labour on the grounds that the low wages which the colliers were being paid did not provide anything like a living wage. Their dispute provided a focal point for the widespread discontent which had been growing in the Durham coalfield for many years. On 20 November 1869 a decision was made in the Market Hotel in Durham to form a Durham miners' union. Crawford became involved somewhat later, but was appointed a full-time agent in May 1870. Thereafter his position and influence grew considerably. He was invited to become president at the end of 1870 and from 1872 acted in addition as secretary of the DMA, itself on the way to becoming the largest separate miners' union in the United Kingdom. In 1872 the DMA secured replacement of the yearly bond by a fortnightly agreement.<br>
<br>The union was formed at an opportune time. Trade was beginning to boom and continued to do so until 1873 when conditions quickly changed. During 1873 coal prices fell. Demand was far lower than the industry's capacity to produce coal and this was reflected in the continued reduction of wage rates. The union's early responses to these troubled times bore the mark of Crawford's influence. Although he had a lasting concern to improve legislative regulation over coalmining accidents and workmen's compensation, he was driven in his regular dealings with miners and colliery owners by more personal and powerful instincts. Committed to the cause of improving the position of working men through trade union action, he consistently opposed unconstitutional strike action. As a religious nonconformist he was opposed to industrial militancy; only by moderation and tolerance did he foresee negotiations being maintained with the coal owners on the basis of mutual respect. He worked hard to establish and maintain conciliation boards and representative committees to establish wage levels in general and colliery price lists and tonnage rates in particular.<br>
<br>Under Crawford the Durham Miners' Association had a highly developed system of collective bargaining based on a sliding scale of wages and defence of traditional working hours and shift systems. Crawford acquiesced in the coal owners' view that wages should vary with the selling price of coal in both an upward and downward direction. This issue, together with the question of the length of the working day, affected Durham's relationship with other mining associations and ultimately with the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), formed in 1888. Sliding-scale wage agreements fell out of favour in other coalfields during the 1880s: the MFGB resisted their continuation and remained determined to secure legislative limitation of miners' daily working hours to a maximum of eight. The dispute over the statutory working day led Durham to refuse to join the MFGB, a divide which left the Durham miners in a vulnerable position in their major strike of 1892. Crawford remained convinced, however, that his duty was to protect the interests of the Durham miners as he saw them.<br>
<br>Better suited to the detailed complexity of committee work rather than to platform oratory, Crawford was nevertheless skilful in negotiation and a man of considerable executive power; he was a solver of problems, as well as a manager of men. Short-tempered and intolerant at times, he remained utterly convinced of the power of trade unionism. In politics he was a firm Liberal, and sat on the parliamentary committee of the TUC from 1878 to 1890 and was its chairman in 1881 and again in 1888. He was elected to parliament in 1885 for Mid Durham, and re-elected in 1886, serving as its MP until his death. For some years he was an alderman of the Durham county council.<br>
<br>Although he contributed to committee work in the House of Commons, Crawford participated very little in parliamentary affairs, never once speaking on the floor of the house. Nevertheless he held strong views, consistently rejecting socialism as invalid in favour of a radical brand of Liberalism by which people like himself could stand for parliament as a candidate in the Labour interest, but with Liberal sponsorship. Up to the time of his death he remained committed to mining affairs. He was secretary of the Miners' National Association from 1877 to 1890, and in the year of his death he attended the international miners' conference in Belgium. He joined the freemasons in 1878 and was worshipful master of his local lodge in 1886. He died at his home, 15 North Road, Durham, on 1 July 1890. He was survived by his wife.<br>
