<span class="headword">Hill,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">secretary of the Royal Society and cultural dilettante</span>, baptized on 16 June 1635 at St Dionis Backchurch, London, was the eldest son of Richard Hill (<i>d</i>. 1660), a prosperous London cordwainer and alderman, and of his wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1660). He seems to have had no higher education and was probably brought up as a merchant. By 1658 he had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1661), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29297/', "Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke")</script>, with whom he had a daughter, Frances (1658&#150;1736), and a son, Richard (1660&#150;1722). There were no children from Abraham's subsequent second marriage, to Elizabeth (1644&#150;1672), daughter of Michael Pratt of Bromley by Bow, Middlesex.<br>
<br>In 1660 Hill's life took a crucial turn. He inherited a moderate fortune at his parents' death, he bought Sutton Manor at Sutton-at-Hone, Kent, and he rented chambers at Gresham College, right in the heart of the social and intellectual world of the Royal Society of London [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59221', "Founder members of the Royal Society")</script>]. There he was part of the discussions which preceded the society's inception. Hill's role at the centre of this institution is demonstrated by his election to its council for the sessions 1663 to 1666 and 1672 to 1721. At the same time he was treasurer (1663&#150;6, 1677&#150;99), and for two years he was secretary (1673&#150;5). He attended frequently at both council and society meetings throughout his sixty-year affiliation.<br>
<br>Hill's role in the London intellectual scene was hardly noted by the great recorders of London life&#151;John Evelyn, Samuel Pepys, and John Aubrey&#151;but he played a large role in the life of Robert Hooke, whose diary provides a context for this otherwise unnoted Royal Society functionary. While in 1677 Hooke suspected that Hill backed Nehemiah Grew rather than himself for the post of secretary&#151;&#145;This evening Hill &hellip; plotted for Grew againste me&#146; and &#145;Hill a dog for Grew. Hill and Louther slyly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Robert Hooke &hellip; 1672&#150;1680</span>, 333, 335)&#151;they were cronies who met at least once a week at coffee houses or taverns to discuss matters of scientific interest (&#145;Excellent good discourse&#146;; ibid., 245). Indeed, in 1676 they met almost every other day and sometimes up to three times in one day; and while such meetings later thinned the pattern of social life remained into the 1690s. They visited each other and for a time Hill was so central to Hooke's life that he noted the former's absences and returns to London. Apart from shared administrative tasks in the Royal Society such as the acquisition of the Arundel Library and the property and land around Chelsea College, Hooke showed Hill drafts of his papers and lectures and gave him copies of his books. They collected and shared books and occasionally collaborated on experiments. Hill was a member of the various philosophical clubs which Hooke spawned in the 1670s and 1680s and frequented all the fashionable haunts where philosophical matters were discussed.<br>
<br>Hill's activities within the society represent many facets of the late seventeenth-century scientific endeavour. On the council he audited accounts, pursued errant fellows' arrears, and worked on committees concerned with the society's real estate and other possessions; he registered its letters and papers and helped to index the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. In the society his contributions were eclectic but representative of a virtuoso's commitment to the widest definition of natural philosophy. His administrative skills came to the fore on committees such as those for the history of trades, surveying England, geological observations, and for handling correspondence and planning experiments for later meetings. He sent questionnaires to exotic places to be answered by travellers and collected curiosities brought back from such voyages; he helped to investigate water and air purity, the depth of the sea, breathing under water, hurricanes, distance travelled by shot at sea, Hooke's &#145;pepper mite&#146; observations, the rate of fall of bodies, air pressure, and techniques of wine and paper making. But it is clear that Hill was not, himself, an experimenter. Many of his contributions came from his book learning&#151;both ancient and modern authorities&#151;and they usually displayed his eye for the exotic and strange such as Russian poisoning practices, their elk leather production, and the anatomy of whales. He used his reading for confirming or discounting what others produced at meetings. Later in life he was bequeathed money by Sir John Copley (<i>d</i>. 1709) for what was to become the Copley medal of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>From 1691 until the latter's death in 1694 Hill was comptroller to John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury. Indeed, after the accession of William and Mary his public career took off and he was a member of the Board of Trade between 1696 and 1702. In old age he retired to Sutton-at-Hone where he grew fruit for the making of perry and cider. Hill died on 5 February 1722 and was buried with his second wife in Sutton-at-Hone church. His career graphically demonstrates how multi-faceted the role of a &#145;man of business&#146; and &#145;virtuoso&#146; might be in the cultural life of the Royal Society and in government.<br>
