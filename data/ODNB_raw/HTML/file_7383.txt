<span class="headword">Dean,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> 1778), <span class="occ">essayist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 8 November 1726 at Kirkby in Craven (or Kirkby Malham) in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Robert Dean (<i>d</i>. 1766) and his wife, Elizabeth King (<i>bap</i>. 1704, <i>d</i>. 1788/9). Nothing is known of his childhood or his upbringing. However, the university education sometimes attributed to him is fictitious. Like many boys of relatively humble origins in the eighteenth century, Dean was destined for the church; his vocation was to be a teacher and a scholar. He became master of Middleton grammar school, near Manchester, the third oldest foundation in Lancashire, receiving his first stipend from the patrons, Brasenose College, Oxford, on Lady day 1753. Licensed by the bishop of Chester on 8 July 1754, Dean was also ordained curate on 15 September, probably serving at St Leonard's parish church in Middleton. He was certainly the first curate at St Paul's in nearby Royton, a chapel established in 1754 as part of the church extension movement in south-east Lancashire. Although not licensed to this post until as late as 7 July 1757, marriage registers at St Leonard's confirm that Dean regularly performed duties in both places until his retirement from Royton in 1760.<br>
<br>By the late 1750s Dean was comfortably ensconced both as schoolmaster and curate of Middleton. His rector was the learned Dr Richard Assheton, kinsman of the lord of the manor and a senior Manchester clergyman with moderately evangelical leanings. Dean now enjoyed several years of professional contentment. His personal life also brought him happiness and further opportunities. On 20 November 1764 he married Hannah Lancashire (1744/5&#150;1771). In order to supplement his income, he took a small farm on the hill at Hebers, above Middleton, leased from the manor; in 1765 he even advertised lodgings for pupils in the <span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span> (22 January). However, the later 1760s were an unhappy time for Dean. Sir Ralph, the last Assheton lord of Middleton, died in 1765, leaving the estate to his two married daughters and an uncertain future. Dean had been a witness to Sir Ralph's will and was required to pray for the soul of the deceased. The next year Dean's father died. His young wife Hannah also contracted a long and ultimately fatal illness.<br>
<br>It was in this understandably depressing period that Dean composed the text for which he is principally noted, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Future Life of Brute Creatures</span> (1767). Published in Manchester by subscription and reprinted in London in 1768, the <span class="italic">Essay</span> enjoyed the patronage of the Asshetons and other leaders of regional society. Otherwise just another contribution to an age-old technical debate recently enlivened by Locke and Voltaire, Dean's work displayed two distinctive aspects which accounted for its momentary popularity. First, he volubly attacked the insidious philosophical materialism of the contemporary Enlightenment. Second, he offered a striking depiction of &#145;natural evil&#146; as the product of moral weakness. Both features must have appealed to Lancashire's landed &eacute;lite, many of them sympathetic to the revivalist sentiments sweeping through established English religion. Dean savaged those, like Descartes and La Mettrie, who thought animals mere machines, devoid of souls. He spoke of sin and salvation for man and animal alike, appealing emotively to the evangelical mood of the age. He also attacked both determinism and predestination, asserting the absolute primacy of free will in human morality. This was perhaps the most crucial polemical feature of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, which was disparaging of Calvinism in particular. Presbyterianism, after all, was the separatist tradition which, throughout the Manchester area, was the principal rival to the evangelicalism offered by Dr Assheton and his like-minded colleagues from within the Anglican church.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> subsequently fell into an obscurity explicable by its very pertinence to this singular context. James Rothwell, a more conventional Anglican who mistrusted its evangelical flavour, responded with the <span class="italic">Letter to the Reverend Mr Dean</span> (1769). But by the early 1770s Dean's work had largely been forgotten. His life now entered its final, dark phase. Dean's wife died on 20 February 1771 and was buried three days later in the churchyard of St Leonard's. Always somewhat irascible, Dean thereafter became embroiled in a property dispute with the manorial steward of the absentee lord, Sir Harbord Harbord of Gunton, Norfolk. Over the next few years, his two surviving children, Ann and Elizabeth, also died. Dean may even have neglected his duties at the grammar school, whose fabric fell into disrepair during the final years of his tenure. Samuel Bamford, recounting local legend, describes the schoolmaster around this time as a superstitious individual, afraid of ghosts and constantly aware of his own mortality  (Bamford, 1.29). Such intimations were prescient. On 8 February 1778, after a period of ill health, Richard Dean died at Middleton; he was buried two days later beside his wife and children in St Leonard's churchyard.<br>
