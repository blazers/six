<span class="headword">McLaren <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pochin]</span>,  Laura Elizabeth</span>, Lady Aberconway  (1854&#150;1933), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights and horticulturist</span>, was born at Camp Street, Broughton, Lancashire, on 14 May 1854, the only surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47964/', "Henry Davis Pochin (1824&#150;1895)")</script>, industrial chemist and MP, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56284/', "Agnes Pochin, n&#233;e Heap (1825&#150;1908)")</script>, an activist for women's rights. Her parents were radical Liberals, and on 6 March 1877 at the old Westminster meeting-house, with John Bright as a witness, Laura Pochin married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34776/', "Charles Benjamin Bright McLaren (1850&#150;1934)")</script>, elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47643/', "Priscilla Bright McLaren")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17640/', "Duncan McLaren")</script>, members of the same political and social network. Charles McLaren was a barrister at the time of their marriage, became Liberal MP for Bosworth in 1892, and was later actively involved in running steel, iron, and colliery undertakings, many linked with the Pochin inheritance. Although her husband was a Quaker, there is no evidence that Laura, whose parents were Unitarians, adopted his faith. They had four children who survived infancy: two sons, the younger of whom was killed in action in 1917, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Although no details are known of Laura Pochin's education, it is certain that considerable attention would have been paid to it. She was brought up by parents who thought that women had the right to equal treatment with men, both politically and legally. Her mother had specifically written that women should receive an education to fit them for a career. Laura McLaren's obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> was to write that she was &#145;a capable woman of business, with the ready grasp and the courageous power of decision that enabled her to weigh big problems with the brain of a man&#146;, and it would appear that this was the view taken by her father, because, her surviving brother proving unsatisfactory, she was made her father's heir.<br>
<br>Laura McLaren was proud of the fact that, as a child, she had attended the country's first public women's suffrage meeting, at which her mother had spoken. Immediately after her marriage she became a member of the executive committee of the London National Society of Women's Suffrage; she became a member of the finance committee, and was treasurer in 1885. Later she served on the executive committee of the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage and was president of the South Kensington Women's Liberal Association: about 1890 she prepared a summary of the evidence presented to the House of Lords on the sweating system of labour, on behalf of the Women's Liberal Federation. In 1908 Fisher Unwin published her pamphlet <span class="italic">&#145;Better and happier&#146;: an answer from the Ladies' Gallery to the speeches in opposition to the Women's Suffrage Bill, February 28, 1908</span>. In it she puts cogently the well-rehearsed arguments that she and her fellow suffragists had broadcast for the previous forty years. Responding to Herbert Gladstone's suggestion that women must get out to convert the electorate to their viewpoint, she writes<blockquote>men who suggest this spade-work do not know at what cost to women it is done. In the first place women are miserably poor; the wives of rich men have often nothing but their dress allowance; &hellip; half the women of this country work for a wage which a Royal Commission declared to average not more than 1s a day; married women are busily occupied with their homes and with their children &hellip; to do spadework&#151;to carry on political agitation&#151;needs a lifetime of leisure. &hellip; How often have we tramped along the muddy lanes, how often have we gone round from door to door, often receiving rebuffs and unkindness. Well do we remember dreary railway stations at midnight, the last train gone, and snow upon the ground. (L. E. McLaren, <span class="italic">&#145;Better and Happier&#146;</span>, 1908, 17)</blockquote>She was the author of a very practical document, <span class="italic">The Woman's Charter of Rights and Liberties&#151;Preliminary Draft</span> (1909), which was undertaken as the result of a decision made at the fifth congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance to present simultaneously in 1910 to all the parliaments of the world a comprehensive statement or charter detailing the legal injustices and legislative needs of women. By 1913 she was a vice-president of the non-party National Political League for Men and Women. During the First World War she ran a nursing home for officers in her London home, 43 Belgrave Square, for which she was appointed CBE and was made lady of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem. After the war, the suffrage issue having been settled, she carried on her interest in feminist issues as a member of the Open Door Council.<br>
<br>Laura McLaren inherited the Bodnant estate above the River Conwy from her father in 1895; her husband was ennobled as Baron Aberconway in 1911. She was a very keen gardener, both in Wales and at her much-loved villa in the south of France. She fostered a love of plants in her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34777/', "Henry Duncan McLaren")</script>, to whom in 1901 she entrusted the day-to-day care of the Bodnant garden. She was especially interested in spring and summer herbaceous plants, roses, peonies, and the native flora, and was particularly involved in developing the semi-formal borders around the house. She was continuously consulted over the long process of creating the magnificent series of terraces to the west of the house, and it was as an active partner with her son that she was long remembered at Bodnant. <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituarist described her as one of the foremost horticulturists in Europe and a painter of merit. Lady Aberconway died on 4 January 1933 at the Ch&acirc;teau de la Garoupe, her villa near Antibes, leaving an estate valued at &pound;0.75 million, and was buried at the Bodnant mausoleum, The Poem.<br>
