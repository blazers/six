<span class="headword">Weston, Sir  Richard</span>  (1591&#150;1652), <span class="occ">canal builder and agriculturist</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Richard Weston (1564&#150;1613), of Sutton, Surrey, and great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29121/', "Sir Francis Weston")</script>. His family was quite distinct from those of the first earl of Portland and of Sir Richard Weston, baron of the exchequer. The agriculturist is said to have been educated in Flanders, or at least to have spent a considerable part of his early life there; but there are phrases in his <span class="italic">Discours</span> which imply that he was visiting Flanders for the first time in 1644. In 1613, on his father's death, he succeeded to the family estates at Sutton and Clandon. On 27 July 1622 he was knighted at Guildford. He married Grace (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of John Harper of Cheshunt, and they had seven sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>A promoter of the pound lock as a means of improving navigation on canals and rivers, Sir Richard Weston attempted by this means to make the Wey navigable from Guildford to its junction with the Thames at Weybridge. In 1635 he was appointed one of the royal commissioners for the prosecution of the work. It was perhaps the expenditure necessitated by his canal scheme which forced him in 1641 to sell Temple Court Farm at Merrow, with the mansion at West Clandon, to Sir Richard Onslow, MP for Surrey in the Long Parliament. Shortly after this the river undertaking was interrupted by the civil war. Sir Richard was a royalist and a Catholic. The manor house of Sutton was entirely unsuited for defence, while the neighbouring town of Guildford was in the hands of the parliamentarians; Sir Richard's possessions were sequestrated, and he seems to have been compelled to flee from the country. In 1644 he was at Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp. It was in the course of his exile that he made those observations on the agricultural methods of the Low Countries which were subsequently embodied in his work, <span class="italic">A Discours of Husbandrie used in Brabant and Flanders</span> (1650).<br>
<br>In 1649 Weston entered into an agreement with Major James Pitson, commissioner for Surrey under the parliament, that the latter should solicit the discharge of his sequestration and forward his schemes for rendering the Wey navigable. Accordingly a petition was presented in the names of Pitson and the corporation of Guildford. A bill authorizing the works was brought into the House of Commons on 26 December 1650, and passed as an act on 26 June 1651. The capital was &pound;6000, of which Sir Richard was to find half, undertaking at the same time to complete the canal within six months. Sir Richard employed two hundred men at a time, and used timber of his own to the value of &pound;2000. Materials and timber were also taken, by permission of the parliament, from the king's estates of Oatlands and Richmond. Weston died in May 1652, less than a year after the passing of the act, and by then some 10 out of the 14 miles of canal were completed, though at an expenditure much exceeding the original estimate.<br>
<br>The work was continued by Weston's son and Major Pitson, and the canal was opened in November 1653. The completed canal had ten locks, four weirs, and twelve bridges; but, although it produced a large revenue, it involved the family in litigation which, when finally settled in 1671, had more than swallowed up all the profits. At the Restoration an attempt was made by a certain John Radcliffe to gain control of the canal. A committee of the House of Commons which sat to investigate his claims came to the conclusion that &#145;Sir Richard Weston was the designer of the navigation, and they were satisfied that Mr. [John] Weston's estate was left to him encumbered by reason of his father undertaking the navigation&#146;  (Manning and Bray, 3, appx lvi).<br>
<br>Even more important than Sir Richard Weston's canal schemes were his agricultural improvements. He writes himself that at the time he went out of England he had had &#145;thirtie years' experience in Husbandrie&#146; and had &#145;improved my Land as much as anie man in this Kingdom hath done both by water and fire&#146;  (Weston, 5). Following Rowland Vaughan, Sir Richard raised rich crops of hay by &#145;floating&#146; water meadows, and these are referred to by a contemporary writer:<blockquote>Because hay is dear in those parts this year, near three pound a load, Sir Richard Weston told me he sold at near that rate one hundred and fifty loads of his extraordinary hay which his meadows watered with his new river did yield. (Speed, 35)</blockquote>Sir Richard's account of Flemish husbandry was written about 1645, and addressed to his sons from abroad. This was circulated in manuscript, and there is no evidence that it was printed before 1650, when an imperfect copy was published by Samuel Hartlib, with a dedication to the council of state. Hartlib did not at this time know who the author was. The account is the first English description of the use of a farming rotation including turnips and clover to obtain maximum output from heathlands formerly considered of little agricultural value. Although it is not known to what extent Sir Richard emulated on his own estates what he saw in Flanders, he described a farming system that was to become the cornerstone of the English &#145;agricultural revolution&#146; a century later.<br>
<br>An &#145;enlargement&#146; of the <span class="italic">Discours</span> was published in 1651  (Perkins, 61), and on 2 May of that year and again on 10 October Hartlib wrote to Sir Richard, whom he had been &#145;credibly informed&#146; was the author of the <span class="italic">Discours</span>, asking him for some further information on the subject of clover cultivation and requesting him to &#145;make compleat and sufficiently enlarged&#146; for the benefit of all &#145;his former treatise&#146;. As Sir Richard took no notice, Hartlib published a second edition of the pamphlet in 1652, adding transcripts of his two letters to Sir Richard. Hartlib's <span class="italic">Legacie &hellip; of Husbandry</span> (a collection of anonymous notes on agricultural matters) has sometimes been erroneously attributed to Sir Richard Weston.<br>
<br>Weston died at the age of sixty-one, in May 1652, and was buried in Trinity Chapel, Guildford, on 8 May. His wife died in February 1669, and was buried with her husband. Sir Richard was succeeded by his second son, John.<br>
