<span class="headword">Cookson,  William George</span>  (1939&#150;2003), <span class="occ">editor and poet</span>, was born on 8 May 1939 at King's College Hospital, London, the only child of George Heinrich Frederick Cookson (<i>d</i>. 1949), an inspector of schools who had published several books of verse and in 1936 had founded the magazine <span class="italic">English</span>, and his wife, Rachel Vera, formerly Barry, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pelham-Burn, who had trained as a concert pianist. His parents then lived at 8 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, Battersea, London. His father was getting on in years when Cookson was born (he died when Cookson was ten), but his retirement allowed the family to live first at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and then at Elstead, Surrey, where Cookson remembered his father as instilling in him a deep love of nature and of literature. When his father died Cookson and his mother moved back to Cranbourne Court, where they lived at number 5. Cookson continued to live there for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Cookson was educated at The Hall preparatory school, Hampstead, and (as a day boy) at Westminster School, where he proved himself an ardent reader and an able oarsman, and with his friends Edmund Gray and Howard Burns helped to revive the school magazine, <span class="italic">The Trifler</span>, to which he contributed fragmentary poems in the manner of David Jones and Ezra Pound. He also joined the London committee working to free Pound from St Elizabeth's Hospital for the Insane in Washington, and made friends with the poetry editor of <span class="italic">Nine</span> magazine, Peter Russell. It was Russell who introduced Cookson to Czeslaw and Krystyna Bednarczyk, the Polish printers who later produced <span class="italic">Agenda</span> from their Poets' and Painters' Press under the railway arches close to the Festival Hall.<br>
<br>By the age of seventeen Cookson was reviewing modern poetry regularly for <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> magazine and corresponding with Pound in America. It was on the basis of this friendship that he visited Pound on his release in May 1958, at Brunnenburg Castle in the Italian Tyrol. In <span class="italic">Agenda: an Anthology</span> (1994) he explained how the magazine, first published in 1959, grew from this visit, and how the shape of its first few issues owed something to Pound's <span class="italic">Four Pages</span> and to Pound's biographer, Noel Stock, in <span class="italic">Edge</span>. The magazine from the beginning had a propagandist aim. Pound wrote the first editorial, with Cookson introducing readers to the best work of David Jones and Hugh MacDiarmid, and Peter Russell introducing the poetry of Osip Mandelstam.<br>
<br>In 1960 Cookson went up to New College, Oxford, to read English under John Bayley, taking <span class="italic">Agenda</span> with him. It was while at Oxford that he published Alan Neame's memorable translation of Jean Cocteau's long poem, <span class="italic">L&eacute;one</span>, moving the magazine away from its short format to its more characteristic book length. Also at Oxford he met the poet Peter Dale who helped him widen his editorial horizons by including discussions on the craft of poetry. Special issues of the magazine began to appear dedicated to what at the time were neglected writers of the past (figures such as Wyndham Lewis and H. D. [Hilda Doolittle]) and important themes such as rhyme, rhythm, and verse drama, as well as poetry in translation. Agenda Editions also occasionally brought out books of poetry, among which Cookson was proudest of Peter Dale's sonnet sequence, <span class="italic">One Another</span>, and the reprint of Laurence Binyon's translation of Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span>.<br>
<br>Once Cookson had returned to London carrying his third-class degree (he had only studied the Old English part of the syllabus), he soon found funding from the Arts Council for <span class="italic">Agenda</span>. When the Arts Council withdrew its funding after twenty-seven years the magazine continued with generous support from T. S. Eliot's widow, Valerie, and J. Paul Getty, among others. Cookson's gift as an editor lay in being a patient reader. The poet Kathleen Raine said he was the finest and closest reader of poems she had known. His own credo as an editor was that<blockquote>A great poem must remain a mystery. In every age, it is a rare event &hellip; lasting poetry remains timeless and is therefore always contemporary&#151;it does not date, like the ephemera. One of the aims of <span class="italic">Agenda</span> should be to take a stand against the trivia, cleverness, dull predictability&#151;emotion without intellect, fancy without imagination&#151;that pervades much widely praised and award-winning, current poetry, both here and in the USA. (<span class="italic">Agenda: an Anthology</span>, xxv&#150;xxvi)</blockquote>His successor as editor of <span class="italic">Agenda</span>, Patricia McCarthy, said of Cookson's approach to poetry that he loved &#145;transcendence over the mundane and popular polemic&#146;  (McCarthy, 7). On all matters he was a man of rare generosity and spirit. He was particularly interested in the influence of other cultures on English poetry, and brought out issues on poetry from many foreign countries and regions. Over the years sections of Pound's developing <span class="italic">Cantos</span> appeared in the magazine, along with the work of a majority of the leading poets of the latter half of the twentieth century: Theodore Roethke, Louis Zukosfsky, Basil Bunting, David Gascoyne, Tom Scott, Robert Lowell, William Carlos Williams, Charles Tomlinson, Ian Hamilton, Geoffrey Hill, Seamus Heaney, W. D. Snodgrass, Thom Gunn, Derek Walcott, Eugenio Montale, and Giuseppe Ungaretti. Cookson was also among the first editors to publish work by young poets such as Elizabeth Jennings, R. S. Thomas, Ted Hughes, Roy Fuller, John Montague, Derek Mahon, Peter Levi, Michael Hamburger, and C. H. Sisson.<br>
<br>Cookson published two books of his own poetry, <span class="italic">Dream Traces</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Vestiges</span> (1987; revised and reissued as <span class="italic">Vestiges and Versions</span>, 2002), which owed a considerable debt to imagism. He was a craftsman of the subjective lyric, discovering tranquillity and quietus in the midst of a hectic, busy, and selfless life. He also edited a selection of Ezra Pound's prose with an introduction for Faber in 1973, and in 1985 brought out a superlatively detailed <span class="italic">Guide to the Cantos of Ezra Pound</span> for New Directions in the USA (later reprinted with updates by Anvil Press in London).<br>
<br>On 19 December 1973 Cookson married Vera Lungu, a 35-year-old Romanian, and daughter of Petru Lungu, a teacher. The marriage was dissolved shortly after, and on 20 July 1985 Cookson married the 37-year-old Margaret Elizabeth Craddock, medical secretary, and daughter of George Henry Craddock, company secretary. They had one daughter, Emma. He and his family liked to holiday on the Greek islands, and in one of his last reviews for <span class="italic">Agenda</span> he wrote admiringly of Martin Hammond's translation of <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span>, praising its evocation of the beauty of the islands and reminding his readers of their debt to Greek poetry and civilization&#151;the necessity of tradition in a time of turbulent change. He was very fond of T. S. Eliot's observation that &#145;culture is traditional and loves novelty&#146;.<br>
<br>After a lifetime's struggle with alcoholism (his mother too had been a heavy drinker) Cookson died on 2 January 2003 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, just across the River Thames from his beloved Battersea Park. In his funeral address at St Mary's Church, Battersea, on 22 January 2003, the earl of Gowrie said of him: &#145;To edit a magazine for more than 40 years is a remarkable achievement. To do so without compromising your vision of what poetry is, and what poetry is for, is a heroic one&#146;  (&#145;Address by Lord Gowrie&#146;, in McCarthy, 29).<br>
