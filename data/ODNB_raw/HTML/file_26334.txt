<span class="headword">Stayner, Sir  Richard</span>  (1624/5&#150;1662), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was one of several children of Roger Stayner of Tarrant Gunville, Dorset, and in his early life served in the Newfoundland fisheries trade. He married Elizabeth (1635?&#150;1662), daughter of Thomas Hebbe of Loughborough; they had two children, Richard and Elizabeth. Stayner was said to have been the most junior of three Dorset men brought into the Commonwealth navy, probably by Roger Martin, one of their number. Martin commanded the <i>Providence of Poole</i> during the first civil war, on which Stayner could well have gained his earliest fighting experience. He is first mentioned on 25 August 1649 as captain of the prize <i>Elizabeth</i> convoying five ships bound for Hull from the Thames to Yarmouth. He also commanded her in the summer fleet of 1650 and in April he took a prize. The <i>Elizabeth</i> was the largest of the four ships posted &#145;among the sands&#146; in the Thames estuary in the winter of 1650&#150;51  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 1650, 6.473b). In the summer of 1651 he was appointed captain of the sixth rate <i>Cygnet</i> but he was already earmarked for the fifth rate <i>Mermaid</i> which was in the course of being built and to which he moved as soon as she was launched. The following winter she was one of the squadron patrolling the eastern channel.<br>
<br>When the First Anglo-Dutch War began in 1652 Stayner was still in command of the <i>Mermaid</i>. She was one of Blake's squadron during the skirmish off Dover, the first action of the war. Subsequently Stayner went with the fleet under Blake's command which sailed to the Shetland Islands to intercept the Dutch East India ships. The <i>Mermaid</i> was probably one of the frigates which attacked the Dutch squadron protecting their herring busses though she is not mentioned by name. On his return Stayner was promoted to the fourth rate <i>Foresight</i>. His ship was among those which fought at the battle of Portland in February 1653 and appears to have been in Blake's own squadron. The <i>Foresight</i> was part of the main fleet under Monck and Deane which left Portsmouth during April. At the beginning of June Stayner was in Penn's division during the battle of the Gabbard. After the victory he escorted twelve disabled ships, eleven prizes, and 1350 prisoners back to the Thames. He also had on board the body of General Deane who had been killed in the fighting.<br>
<br>The <i>Foresight</i> went to sea again on 23 July 1653 with Stayner still in command, and rejoined the fleet in time to take part in the battle off Scheveningen. During September his ship was in the squadron under Lawson which blockaded the coast of the Netherlands until he was forced, by defective masts, to come home. Stayner was promoted to the new third rate <i>Plymouth</i> in the spring of 1654 and he was soon in action, taking part in the capture of a Dutch East Indiaman during April. In September 1654 the war with the United Provinces being over, Stayner sailed with Blake's fleet to the Mediterranean. One of the objectives of the cruise was to come to an agreement with the dey of Tunis which would prevent further attacks on English shipping. The dey, however, proved obdurate and when Blake sailed away to Trapani the dey thought he had won. He was soon undeceived, for the English returned and destroyed a squadron of Turkish ships at Porto Farina. The <i>Plymouth</i> was one of five ships which remained on patrol during Blake's absence and helped provide covering fire by bombarding the shore installations while boarding parties burnt the ships.<br>
<br>Blake returned to England in September 1655 but war with Spain had been declared and a new fleet under Blake and Mountagu was soon equipping to blockade Spain's Atlantic coast. Stayner was again present when the fleet sailed in April 1656, this time in charge of the <i>Speaker</i>, the most powerful of all the third rates. In the following September Stayner was left with a squadron of six ships off Cadiz while Mountagu was at Sal&eacute; and Blake was with the rest of the fleet revictualling at Lisbon. During their absence Stayner sighted the plate fleet, which consisted of seven Spanish ships and a Portuguese prize. Only three of his squadron were in a position to engage but they performed so effectively that only two of their eight opponents escaped. Of the remainder two were captured, two were sunk, and two ran aground and were lost. The <i>Speaker</i> took the rear-admiral's ship, commanded by Don Juan de Hoyos, and the <i>Tredagh</i> took a rich merchantman.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Mountagu returned home with the booty and the heavier ships but Stayner stayed out with Blake. The following spring Blake learned that the 1657 plate fleet had reached the Canary Islands. He sailed to Tenerife to intercept it. The English fleet attacked the Spaniards as they lay at anchor in the harbour of Santa Cruz. While Blake and the larger vessels provided covering fire, twelve frigates under Stayner's leadership attacked the ships themselves. All seventeen Spanish ships were destroyed without any English loss. Stayner was the last out, his ship severely battered but still afloat. He was knighted in 1658 on his return to England and appointed rear-admiral of the fleet in home waters. Between March and September 1659 he was rear-admiral of an English fleet which sailed to the Sound to counteract the influence of a Dutch fleet which was surreptitiously supporting Denmark in her war with Sweden. By the time it returned the protectorate had fallen. Stayner's attitude to the political upheaval of 1659&#150;60 which followed was rather ambiguous but, like most of the senior fleet officers, he managed to make his peace with Charles II. He went as rear-admiral in the fleet under Mountagu which brought Charles back from the United Provinces and was rewarded by a royal knighthood on 24 September 1660 to replace his Cromwellian one, invalidated by the Restoration.<br>
<br>Early in 1661 Stayner was again in command in the Downs, and in June he was appointed rear-admiral of the fleet commanded by Mountagu (now earl of Sandwich), sent to Portugal for Catherine of Braganza, who was to be Charles II's queen. Stayner was given the task of occupying Tangier, part of her dowry, which he accomplished successfully. Subsequently he supervised the arrangements for the landing of an English army to help the Portuguese in their war against Spain. He fell ill at Lisbon and died there of a fever on 15 October 1662, only thirty-seven years old. His body was embalmed and brought back to England because he had wished to be buried beside his wife, who had died earlier that year. He was interred at St Alfege, Greenwich, on 28 November 1662. On 30 May 1663 Stayner's son Richard was petitioning for the repayment of &pound;300 which his father was said to have advanced for the state's service.<br>
<br>Stayner was a brave and dashing subordinate but his flaws militated against his becoming a great commander. Details of the embezzlement of part of the money captured in the Spanish plate fleet in 1656 have never surfaced but Stayner's protestations of innocence have a hollow ring. At Tenerife Blake had to send orders three times to prevent him endangering the operation by trying to tow ships out as prizes. He had no fixed political or religious principles. In 1654 Blake commended him as a &#145;godly&#146; man and in 1657 he employed Samuel Oates as his chaplain, who had been involved in the Overton plot to overthrow the protectorate. Yet he accepted the succession of Richard as protector when Oliver Cromwell died. In October 1659 he tried to negotiate a compromise between the military junta and the fleet. But when it became clear that a restoration was inevitable he allowed Mountagu to make his peace for him with the king. Pepys's judgement that he was sorry for his death &#145;he being a very stout seaman&#151;but there will be no great miss of him for all that&#146;  (Pepys, 3.249) may well have been echoed outside royalist circles.<br>
