<span class="headword">Sharp,  John</span>  (1572&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born in Edinburgh, of unknown parentage. Educated at the University of St Andrews, he graduated MA in 1592. A theologian of considerable renown, his first work, <span class="italic">Theses theologicae de peccato</span>, was published at Edinburgh in 1600. In 1601 Sharp became minister of Kilmany in Fife. A staunch presbyterian he was appointed clerk to the general assembly of 1605 which met in Aberdeen in defiance of the command of James VI. Ordered before the privy council to explain his conduct, Sharp, along with five other ministers, declined the authority of the court as incompetent to judge a purely ecclesiastical question. The six ministers were subsequently confined in Blackness Castle and charged with treason. The case was heard before a packed jury at Linlithgow in January 1606, and Sharp, together with his five colleagues, was banished for life.<br>
<br>Sharp went to France, and in 1608 he was appointed professor of theology in the college of Die in Dauphin&eacute;. He was a prolific author, whose writings included the <span class="italic">Tractatus de justificatione hominis coram Deo</span> (Geneva, 1609); <span class="italic">Tractatus de misero hominis satu sub peccato</span> (Geneva, 1610); and <span class="italic">Symphonia prophetarum et apostolorum</span> (Geneva, 1625). Sharp's support for a restoration of presbyterianism in Scotland remained constant throughout his time in exile.<br>
<br>In 1618 John Spottiswood, archbishop of St Andrews, indicated that Sharp's recall was imminent and the minister dedicated his <span class="italic">Cursus theologicus</span> to James in the hope of a reconciliation. Negotiations collapsed, however, on Sharp's refusal to submit to the episcopalian regime. The minister remained at Die for a further twelve years until his protestant teachings brought him into conflict with the French government. Taking advantage of Charles I's moratorium on the prosecution of dissident ministers Sharp returned to London in 1630, where &#145;the town council of Edinburgh, hearing that Mr John Sharp &hellip; was by Cardinal Richelieu's procurement thrust out of France &hellip; thought fit to give him a call to the professor of Divinity in [the latter] Colledge&#146;  (Craufurd, 117). He took up the post in November that year.<br>
<br>Probably after 1630 Sharp married Agnes Davidson. The couple had a daughter, Marie, baptized on 18 August 1640, and a son, John, baptized on 8 August 1641. In 1637 Sharp sided with the covenanting party, and, in that year, signed the supplication against the prayer book raised by the presbytery of Edinburgh. He died, probably at Edinburgh, in 1647.<br>
