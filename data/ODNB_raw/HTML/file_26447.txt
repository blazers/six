<span class="headword">Steward <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Wells]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1557), <span class="occ">prior and dean of Ely</span>, was born at Wells next the Sea, Norfolk. His father was Nicholas Steward, a lawyer of the Middle Temple, from an established Norfolk family of minor gentry; his mother was Cicely, daughter of John Baskerville. The family was convinced that they descended from the Stewart royal house, via Sir John Steward, the so-called Scotangle, who moved to England in the service of Henry V. In 1511 the heralds prepared a full, if questionable, genealogy for them, and this became a document of obsessive importance for the family. Robert was clearly proud of this descent: he incorporated a copy with the continuation of the <span class="italic">Historia Eliensis</span>, the history of the see, abbey, and priory of Ely, which he undertook as prior and dean. One of Robert's brothers, Simeon, settled at Lakenheath; another, Nicholas, moved to Ely; both established dynasties which played major roles in the affairs of the see and cathedral.<br>
<br>Robert Steward became a Benedictine monk at Ely, and took his birthplace as his surname in religion. He studied at Cambridge. It has been suggested that he was the pensioner of Gonville Hall who took his BA in 1517 and his MA in 1520. Surviving documentation, however, consistently refers to him simply as clerk without further title. He was elected prior of Ely in 1522, and in the 1520s served in predictable roles in convocation and as a clerical tax collector for the crown. The only evidence of his views on the crisis of the 1530s is his affirmation of the validity of Henry's marriage to Katherine of Aragon in the convocation of 1533. Thereafter he must have accepted the change of religion (as he did all the subsequent changes from then until his death), since Thomas Goodrich, who succeeded the conservative Nicholas West as bishop of Ely in 1534, thought sufficiently highly of him to recommend him to the crown as a possible suffragan bishop of Colchester in 1536. However, the other nominee, William More, was promoted, probably because he was steward to Lord Chancellor Audley. Ely Priory was surrendered to the crown on 18 November 1539, and was refounded as a cathedral with dean and chapter on 10 September 1541. Wells became the first dean, converting his monastic pension of &pound;120 into stipend, and resuming his family surname. Evidence for his management of the priory estate is fragmentary, but he does not seem to have been as ruthless in dispensing long leases and dispersing property as some former monastic heads of house. However, as dean he ensured that his family prospered: there were leases of Lakenheath Manor to Simeon and of the rectory of Ely to Nicholas and his son William. William's relationship by marriage with Bishop Goodrich also helped to secure advantageous episcopal leases. But most of the profit of the Stewards seems to have derived from office holding: they were auditors, coroners, and stewards to both chapter and bishop.<br>
<br>Robert Steward died in Ely on 22 September 1557 and was buried in Ely Cathedral. He had taken a number of the priory's manuscripts into his safe keeping at the dissolution and retained them under the provisions of the Henrician charter. These Ely manuscripts now survive in the British Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and Lambeth Palace Library, and include several copies of the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, the chronicle of the priory and see. The dean's close personal interest in these records is suggested by his rebinding of the texts, as well as by his own work on the continuation of the chronicle. His judgements on the sixteenth-century bishops whom he had known are sympathetic, but not uncritical. Steward's own best memorial is the comment of Henry Wharton who prints his chronicle and genealogy: without his labours the unique <span class="italic">Historia</span> might have been lost.<br>
