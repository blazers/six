<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pring,  Jacob Cubitt</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was baptized at St Mary's, Lewisham, on 3 November 1770, the eldest son of Martha Cubitt (<i>d</i>. in or after 1796) and Jacob Pring (<i>d</i>. in or before 1795). He and two of his brothers all trained as choristers at St Paul's Cathedral, have been credited with taking music degrees at Oxford, and pursued musical careers. The &#145;Master Pring&#146; who sang in concerts at Drury Lane in 1786 was almost certainly Jacob. Appointed organist jointly with Elizabeth Goadby at St Botolph, Aldersgate, in January 1786, he became sole organist in 1790. On 16 December of the latter year he married Mary Shuckburgh, a widow.<br>
<br>Pring is listed as &#145;Composer, organ, tenor clarion&#146;  (Doane, 52), and his participation in oratorios at Drury Lane, in Handel concerts at Westminster Abbey, and in performances at the Academy of Ancient Music is noted. He was a founder member of the music club Concentores Sodales (1798&#150;1847), devoted to the encouragement and performance of English music. His most substantial publication, <span class="italic">Eight Anthems as Performed at St Paul's Cathedral</span> (1791), presents well-crafted, contrapuntally motivated works in an idiom reminiscent of the early Georgian era. Pring also produced glees, &#145;at once graceful, pleasing and brilliant&#146;  (Baptie, 81), vocal canons, solo songs, and some polished keyboard music for amateurs requiring limited technical facility in a backward-looking early classical style. Pring was elected in 1793 to the Royal Society of Musicians, in whose annual benefit concerts he played as a violinist, and later became a governor. On 27 June 1797 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and he took his BMus the next day with his anthem &#145;Let God arise&#146;. He died at his home in Low Layton, Essex, before 10 July 1799, the date on which his employers at St Botolph, Aldersgate, learned of his death; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Jacob Cubitt Pring was soon followed to the grave by his youngest brother <a name="cosubject_69640"></a><span class="headword">Isaac Pring</span>  (1777&#150;1799), <span class="occ">organist and singer</span>, who was born in Kensington Gravel Pits, London, to the north-east of Kensington Gardens, to which the family had moved in the early 1770s. At St Paul's (1784&#150;93) he was notable for his remarkably fine treble voice. Isaac may be identified with the &#145;Master Pring&#146; who deputized successfully for Mrs Clendining at Covent Garden in 1793  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 21 March) singing Galatea's &#145;As when the dove&#146; from Handel's <span class="italic">Acis</span>. Besides participating in other London concerts he performed at Oxford in 1793. He moved there in 1794, becoming assistant to Philip Hayes, organist at New College. On Hayes's death in 1797 Pring succeeded him at New College, matriculating there on 1 March 1799. He appears to have taken his BMus later that year  (Abdy Williams, 97), but it is not listed in the university records, nor is his exercise preserved in the Bodleian Library. He composed anthems and chants, two of the latter being printed in the collection of Bennett and Marshall (1829). At Oxford he became a friend of William Crotch, successor to Hayes as professor of music. He died from consumption and was buried in the cloister at New College, Oxford, on 23 September 1799.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69642"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Pring</span>  (1773&#150;1842), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was baptized on 27 December 1775 at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, aged two and a half years. After his training at St Paul's he sang as a tenor in the same range of London concerts as his brother Jacob. Though appointed organist at Bangor Cathedral in April 1793, he was not formally elected until 1810. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 21 January 1808, and accumulated the degrees of BMus and DMus at Oxford on 27 January. Pring's major publication, <span class="italic">Twenty Anthems &hellip;</span> (1805), attracted a large number of subscribers. Critical opinion, however, has been divided: one commentator claims, &#145;There is much excellent music in these compositions, the boldness of many of the subjects being strongly reminiscent of Boyce&#146;  (Bumpus, 438), while another finds the music &#145;agreeably mellifluous but not very memorable&#146;  (Watkins Shaw, &#145;Church music&#146;, 719).<br>
<br>The three Pring brothers were once described as &#145;amiable&#146;, but Joseph proved also to be astute and resolute. In 1811 he became aware of a scheme devised by the chapter at Bangor to divert for other purposes funds (the tithes of Llandinam) that had by an act of parliament of 1685 hitherto been used partly for the benefit of the cathedral choir and organist. A protracted dispute arose which was eventually resolved by the lord chancellor with a compromise ruling that delivered at least a partial victory for Pring and his choristers. Pring published a full account of the affair in <span class="italic">Papers, documents, law proceedings &hellip; respecting the maintenance of the choir of the cathedral church of Bangor</span> (1819). He died on 13 February 1842 at Bangor, and was buried at Bangor Cathedral. He was succeeded in his post at Bangor by one of his sons, James S. Pring. Another son, Joseph Charles Pring (1799/1800&#150;1876), maintained the family's Oxford connections, becoming chaplain of New College and vicar of Headington.<br>
