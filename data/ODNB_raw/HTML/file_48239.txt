<span class="headword">Trow,  Edward</span>  (1833&#150;1899), <span class="occ">ironworker and trade unionist</span>, was born at Wolverhampton on 29 June 1833, the son of an ironworker. He attended a dame-school in nearby Wednesbury for a few years and at the age of ten entered the iron industry. At thirteen he became an underhand puddler and followed this occupation in a number of places, including Glasgow and Consett, for about fifteen years. By 1863 he had returned to the Black Country and became a lodge secretary in the local puddlers' union which was formed in that year. He held his position until 1867, when he moved to work as a forehand puddler at the Springfield works of Barningham &amp; Co. in Darlington, co. Durham.<br>
<br>The north of England was the preserve of a rival union, the National Association of Ironworkers led by John Kane, but Trow apparently had no qualms about changing his allegiance: perhaps his long absence from the area had softened the local chauvinism characteristic of Black Country people. He joined the northern union's Springfield lodge and was promptly appointed its secretary. When the National Association was reconstituted as the ironworkers' only union in 1868, following the collapse of organization in the Black Country, Trow was elected to the general council. Four years later he became president and assistant secretary and held both offices until 1874. He then relinquished the presidency and took over the combined and paid position of assistant secretary and treasurer.<br>
<br>When Kane died in 1876 Trow succeeded him as general secretary of the union at a salary of &pound;160 per year. He held this post until the National Association was superseded by the Associated Iron and Steel Workers in 1887. He then became general secretary of the new union and remained in this position until his death. Under his leadership the internal friction which had carried over from the regional origins of unionism into the successive national associations was progressively eliminated and his successor, James Cox, took over an organization which was largely free of sectional conflict.<br>
<br>Trow also succeeded Kane as the paid secretary to the workmen's panel of the board of arbitration and conciliation for the manufactured iron trade of the north of England. The success of the board confirmed his belief that industrial relations should be organized on a purely voluntary basis. He said as much in his evidence to the royal commission on labour in 1892, when he dismissed suggestions that the board might consider using statutory arbitration. He was also a member of the commission and his manner of questioning indicated a strong commitment to bringing the two sides of industry closer together. This led him to join Sir David Dale, the chairman of the commission and of the north of England board, in efforts to establish a union of employers and employed. The proposed union was formally constituted in 1895 but it attracted little support and was quickly abandoned.<br>
<br>The political concomitant of these industrial attitudes was &#145;Lib&#150;Labism&#146; and Trow was vice-president of Darlington Liberal Association for many years. His influence among working men was an important factor in holding Darlington for the Gladstonian candidate in the closely contested elections of 1886 and 1892 but Trow never had any political ambitions himself. He was a trustee of the Sons of Temperance Society and a member of the Darlington school board and served as a magistrate from 1892 but otherwise devoted himself exclusively to his union work. Trow's single-minded dedication to his members' interests was acknowledged by gifts from several groups of ironworkers over the years; he also received tributes from foreign trade union delegations to whom he gave advice and assistance.<br>
<br>Trow died suddenly on 9 February 1899 at his home, 6 Paradise Terrace, Darlington. He was survived by his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Batty, and a grown-up family. He was buried in the west cemetery, Darlington, on 14 February 1899, following a service in the cemetery chapel.<br>
