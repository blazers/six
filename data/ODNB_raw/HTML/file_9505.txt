<span class="headword">Fisher <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Bayly, Cross]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1623&#150;1698), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, was born near York; her parents are not known (though the name Fisher appears to be her maiden name), and her date of birth derives from the description of her age as about thirty in 1653. A servant in the house of Richard and Elizabeth Tomlinson of Selby, she became a Quaker before 1652. Shortly afterwards she was imprisoned in York Castle for having rebuked the minister of Selby at the end of public worship, shouting at him, &#145;Come downe, come downe, thou painted beast, come downe. Thou art but a hireling, and deluder of the people with thy lyes&#146;  (Raine, 54). She signed, with five fellow prisoners, <span class="italic">False Prophets and Teachers Described</span>, a tract published in 1652. Released after sixteen months, she then went on a missionary journey to the south and east of England with Elizabeth Williams, an older unmarried woman. In December 1653 they visited Cambridge. Preaching in front of Sidney Sussex College the two were stoned by the &#145;scholars&#146;, whom Fisher addressed as a cage of unclean birds. The women were arrested and, on the instructions of the mayor of Cambridge, were stripped naked to the waist and whipped at the market cross &#145;far more cruelly than is usually done to the worst of Malefactors, so that their Flesh was miserably cut and torn&#146;  (Besse, 1.85). Shortly afterwards Mary Fisher was again imprisoned in York Castle for having reprimanded the &#145;priest&#146; of Pontefract. After six months she was released but she was then imprisoned for another period of three months, at the request of the mayor of Pontefract, for being unrepentant and refusing to give securities for good behaviour. <br>
<br>In 1655, while travelling in the ministry in Buckinghamshire, she was imprisoned for several months for rebuking the &#145;priest&#146; of Newport Pagnell. Later the same year she set out to visit the West Indies and New England with another woman older than herself, Ann Austin, who was married and the mother of five children. After some time in Barbados the two Quakers went to Boston in July 1656. There the deputy governor, Richard Bellingham, and the council refused to allow them to land, and searched their baggage for books and papers, confiscating more than 100 volumes, which were burnt by the common hangman. They were then taken ashore and confined in the common gaol. The master of the ship which brought them was compelled to pay for their support and to give a bond that he would remove them. During their imprisonment they were deprived of writing materials, and their beds and bibles were confiscated by the gaoler for his fees. They were stripped naked &#145;not missing head nor feet, searching betwixt their toes, and amongst their hair&#146; to see if they had witch-marks on their persons  (Norton, 7), and would have been starved if some inhabitants had not bribed the gaoler to be allowed to feed them. They were held incommunicado for five weeks, and banished back to Barbados. Mary Fisher returned to England in 1657, but visited the West Indies again at the end of that year. <br>
<br>In the summer of 1657, together with John Perrot, John Luffe, and three other Quakers, Fisher started a journey, probably intending to go to Jerusalem. After two weeks in Leghorn the six Quakers sailed to the Ionian island of Zante (Zakynthos). From there Fisher set out with three friends for Smyrna, which they reached in November. At the end of February 1659 Fisher and her companions left Turkey, forced out by the English representative, Sir Thomas Bendish, who felt that their behaviour was bringing disgrace to the English nation and religion. From Zante Fisher went to the Morea accompanied by Beatrice Beckley. The two women wanted to speak with Mahomet IV and so went to Adrianople where the Ottoman sultan lay encamped with his army. George Bishop in <span class="italic">New-England Judged</span> (1661) gives a vivid account of the meeting with the sultan. Fisher spoke through an interpreter, whom the sultan heard with much patience and gravity, and when she concluded acknowledged the truth of what she said. Asked what she thought of Mahomet, she admitted &#145;that she knew him not&#146; but &#145;That they judge of him to be true or false, according as the Words and Prophesies he spake were true or false&#146;  (Bishop, 20). The sultan offered her an escort of soldiers to Constantinople, which she declined. She afterwards journeyed on foot to Constantinople, where she obtained passage on a ship. She was in Leghorn in December 1658 and from there set out for England. In March 1659 she wrote to three Yorkshire Quakers and their wives reflecting on her mission to the Mediterranean:<blockquote>I have borne my testimony to the king unto whom I was sent, and he was very noble unto me &hellip; He received the words of truth without contradiction, they do dread the word of God many of them &hellip; The English [in Italy and Turkey] are more bad most of them yet there hath a good word gone through them, and some have received it but they are few. (Mack, 170)</blockquote>In 1662 Fisher married the shipmaster William Bayly of Poole, Dorset, a prominent Quaker preacher and writer. The same year she was arrested on St Martin's Street, London, and though she was pregnant she was roughly ill treated by the officers. While Bayly lived Fisher seems to have followed her preaching mission mainly in and around Dorset. When in June 1675 Bayly died at sea returning from Barbados, three of their children were living: William, Mary, and Susanna. On 19 September 1678 at Horslydown, Southwark, Mary married John Cross, a Quaker cordwainer of London. They lived in London until 1682, when they emigrated to America. Cross died about December 1687. Ten years later, in February 1697, the Quaker Robert Barrow, who had escaped from a shipwreck, writing from Charlestown to his wife in England referred to his &#145;landlady and nurse&#146;, &#145;one whose name you have heard of, a Yorkshire woman, born within two miles of York; her maiden name was Mary Fisher, she that spake to the great Turk afterward Wm Bayly's Wife&#146;  (Vaux, &#145;Robert Barrow's shipwreck&#146; 278). Mary Cross made her will on 28 August 1698 and died before the end of the year in Charlestown (the will was proved on 19 November 1698). Her children married and settled in South Carolina. Her granddaughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68172/', "Sophia Hume, n&#233;e Wigington (1702/3&#150;1774)")</script>, daughter of Susanna Bayly and Henry Wigington and wife of Robert Hume, became a noted Quaker preacher.<br>
