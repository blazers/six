<span class="headword">Bacon,  Richard Mackenzie</span>  (1776&#150;1844), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and music critic</span>, was born in Norwich on 1 May 1776, the only son of Richard Bacon (1745&#150;1812), proprietor from 1794 of the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, one of the leading provincial organs of liberal opinion. He was educated at the Norwich Free School, and on leaving joined the paper; he was manager of the printing department until 1804, when he became proprietor. He also had shares in the Theatre Royal from 1806, and from 1808 served in the Norwich rifle volunteers, rising to the rank of major. In 1813 he and Bryan Donkin obtained a patent for improvements in the apparatus employed in printing. The <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> of 3 December 1814 published a prospectus of Bacon's printing machine, with an account of the progress it had then made, and it was highly praised by the author of the article &#145;Printing&#146; in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (1819). In 1816 he became editor of the <span class="italic">Mercury</span>. He published a number of pamphlets on social, political, and military matters.<br>
<br>Bacon also studied music in London with Samuel Arnold. Having published some music criticism, he founded in 1818 the <span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review</span>: this lasted for ten annual volumes. Written for the most part anonymously, but largely by Bacon himself and his daughters, the <span class="italic">Review</span> was one of the earliest musical journals in England and did much to encourage proper standards of critical discussion. Its interest centred on the education of professional musicians, but it also provided an account of musical events and a picture of early nineteenth-century musical thoughts and attitudes, which remain valuable. What appear to be Bacon's own discussions of new books and their subjects reflect a wide-ranging intellect and a probing mind well schooled in philosophical matters. The journal had considerable influence in its own day, and Bacon was widely respected. About 1822 he issued proposals for an encyclopaedia of music, to be printed by subscription, and to appear in 1823 under his editorship. Although he is said to have collected the materials for this project, it was never published. Bacon was largely responsible for founding the Norfolk and Norwich Triennial Musical Festival in 1824.<br>
<br>In 1797 Bacon had married Jane Louisa (1768&#150;1808), only daughter of Augustine Noverre. Their eldest child, Richard Noverre Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1884), played the cello in the first Norwich Festival and edited the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> after his father's death. Bacon died at Cossey, Norfolk, on 27 November 1844. Besides Richard, Bacon was survived by five other children. His eldest daughter, Louisa Mary Bacon [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1610/', "Barwell, Louisa Mary")</script>], had worked with her father on the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> from its foundation, then, after her marriage to a Mr Barwell, wrote some books on children's musical education. Mary Anne Bacon (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1875) was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> and to other journals, and edited a collection of manuscripts relating to her father. George Peter Bacon (<i>c</i>.1807&#150;1878) was editor and proprietor of the <span class="italic">Sussex Advertiser</span>. Jane M. Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1870), a successful mezzo-soprano, studied music with William Horsley and singing with Manuel Garc&iacute;a, then settled and studied further in Paris before returning to London to complete her studies with Sir George Smart. A further daughter, Rose Bacon, also moved in musical circles.<br>
