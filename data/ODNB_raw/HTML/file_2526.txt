<span class="headword">Blacklock,  William James</span>  (1816&#150;1858), <span class="occ">landscape painter and lithographer</span>, was born on 3 March 1816 in Shoreditch, London, the second of the five children of James Blacklock (1782&#150;1823), bookseller and publisher, and Mary Ann Pearson (1784&#150;1853). In 1818 the family moved to Cumwhitton, Cumberland, where the Blacklock family had been farmers and property owners since the 1730s. James Blacklock was a friend of Charles Thurnam, a publisher, bookseller, and printer in nearby Carlisle, and William was apprenticed under him as a boy along with George Routledge, the future London publisher. In 1833 William first exhibited at the decade-old Academy of Art, Carlisle, and was described as a &#145;rising artist&#146; with a &#145;feeling for nature and a correctness of taste&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle Journal</span>, 2 Nov 1833). In 1836 he moved to London and first exhibited four pictures at the Royal Academy of Arts. J. Robinson of London published a series of his engraved views of the new Newcastle&#150;Carlisle railway in 1838, as well as <span class="italic">Sketches in Norway</span> in 1841 with Blacklock's engravings after studies by Bruce Skinner. Blacklock showed thirty-six pictures at the Royal Academy, four at the British Institution, and eleven at the Society of British Artists from 1836 to 1855. Garnering the praise of the contemporary landscapists J. M. W. Turner, David Roberts, and Thomas Creswick, he developed a picturesque style likened by contemporaries to the works of William Mulready, and gained the patronage of William Gladstone, who bought <span class="italic">Lanercost Abbey</span> in 1847. In the same year Blacklock's <span class="italic">Calder Abbey</span> was selected by a prize-holder in the London Art Union. The Scottish artist and head of the Newcastle School of Art, William Bell Scott (1811&#150;1890), introduced him to the important Tyneside lead manufacturer and art collector James Leathart (1820&#150;1895), who bought several paintings in the 1850s and brought Blacklock to the notice of the industrialist and collector William Armstrong (1810&#150;1900). In 1850 Blacklock moved back to Cumwhitton owing to ill health and failing eyesight, establishing a studio at Stanwix. By this time he was regarded as &#145;<i>the</i> painter of Cumberland&#146; and more specifically &#145;the painter <i>par excellence</i> of lake and mountain scenery, border tower and heath-clad waste&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle Journal</span>, 21 Feb 1851, 23 June 1855). By late 1854 Blacklock's career had become seriously threatened by illness and loss of vision in one eye, and in the next year he gave up work and his youngest brother, Thomas, consigned him to the Crichton Institution in Dumfries. According to medical records, he died there on 12 March 1858 of general paralysis of the insane, or syphilis, after much mental deterioration; he was buried on 16 March at Cumwhitton. The <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> obituary described him as a &#145;truthful and unpretending artist, who wooed nature rather than popular favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1 May 1858). Over thirty oils and watercolours are in the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle. There are works in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Gallery of Ireland; drawings executed while in the Crichton Institution are at Edinburgh University Library.<br>
