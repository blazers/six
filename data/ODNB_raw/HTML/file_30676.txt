</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beit,  Alfred</span>  (1853&#150;1906), <span class="occ">mining magnate and philanthropist</span>, born at Hamburg on 15 February 1853, was the eldest son of Siegfried and Laura Beit. His father was a merchant belonging to a well-known Hamburg family descended from Portuguese Jews, and Lutheran by religion. Beit was educated privately, and at eighteen entered the Amsterdam office of Messrs Robinow, diamond merchants, after which he joined the Cape Colony branch of D. Lippert &amp; Co., to whom he was related. Early in September 1875 he sailed for Cape Town, and, proceeding to the diamond mining centre of Kimberley by wagon, was one of Lippert's representatives there until 1878, when he revisited Hamburg. His Amsterdam training enabled him to see that Cape diamonds, so far from deserving their reputation of being an inferior product, were generally as good as any in the world, and were being sold in Africa at a price far below their worth in Europe. Accordingly borrowing &pound;2000 from his father by way of capital, he returned to Kimberley in the same year, and set up under his own name as a diamond merchant. Foreseeing the growth of Kimberley, he is said to have invested most of his capital in purchasing ground on which he put up a number of corrugated iron offices. For twelve of these the rent ultimately received by him was estimated at &pound;1800 a month, and later he is believed to have sold the ground for &pound;260,000.<br>
<br>In 1882 Beit became associated in the diamond business at Kimberley with J. Porg&egrave;s and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36834/', "Julius Wernher")</script>. In 1884 Porg&egrave;s and Wernher returned to England and constituted the London firm of J. Porg&egrave;s &amp; Co., dealing in diamonds and diamond shares, and after 1888 in goldmines as well. Beit was sole representative of this firm at Kimberley until 1889, when he made London his headquarters, although his subsequent visits to Africa were frequent. On 1 January 1890 the firm of Wernher, Beit &amp; Co. replaced J. Porg&egrave;s &amp; Co. in the same line of business.<br>
<br>When settled at Kimberley, Beit made the acquaintance of Cecil John Rhodes, and close business relations followed. Yielding to the force of Rhodes's personality, he became his intimate friend, accepting his ideas and aspirations with enthusiasm. He soon joined Rhodes on the board of the original De Beers Diamond Company (founded in 1880) and played an important part in Rhodes's great scheme for the amalgamation of the chief diamond mines of Kimberley as De Beers Consolidated Mines. The scheme took effect in 1888 after Beit had advanced to Rhodes without security a sum of &pound;250,000.<br>
<br>By this time goldmining activity in the Transvaal republic, which first began at Barberton in 1884, had spread to the conglomerate formation of Witwatersrand, familiarly known as the Rand. The Rand was declared a public goldfield on 20 September 1886. Early in 1888 Beit paid it a visit, and before leaving Kimberley he arranged provisionally that Hermann Eckstein should establish a branch of his firm on the Rand, trading as H. Eckstein&#151;later H. Eckstein &amp; Co. Perceiving the possibilities of the area, Beit acquired a large interest in the best of the outcrop mines, which soon became valuable properties. But his chief stroke was made several years later, when he revisited South Africa and illustrated his characteristic perception of possibilities. Adopting the suggestion, in face of much expert scepticism, that it might be possible not only to work the outcrop but to strike the slanting reef by deep level shafts, at some distance away from the outcrop, he evolved, and devoted capital to testing, the deep levels of the Rand. Beit was the first to recognize the importance of employing first-class mining engineers, and with their aid he proved the scheme to be practicable. In the whole deep level system Beit's firm were forerunners and creators; other firms, including Rhodes's Consolidated Goldfields, followed in their footsteps.<br>
<br>Beit, who had become a naturalized British subject, was deeply interested in Rhodes's scheme of northern expansion. On the formation of the chartered British South Africa Company in 1889 for the conquest of the extensive territory afterwards known as Southern and Northern Rhodesia (and later as Zimbabwe and Zambia), Beit became an original director. He first visited the country in 1891. He later joined the boards of the various Rhodesian railway companies. But when extensive prospecting failed to locate goldfields of any significance between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers, Beit's interest in the Rand redoubled. Like a number of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95075', "Randlords")</script>, Beit was impatient with the rule of President Kruger. Rhodes and Beit together placed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34155/', "Starr Jameson")</script> with an armed force on the Transvaal border (December 1895). After nebulous intrigue with Johannesburg there followed the raid into the Transvaal. Beit's share in this blunder cost him &pound;200,000. Censured for his part in the affair by the British South Africa committee of the House of Commons in 1897, he resigned his directorship of the chartered company. During the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 he spent immense sums on the Imperial light horse and on the equipment of the Imperial yeomanry, and before and after the war he poured money into land settlement, immigration, and kindred schemes for the development of South Africa.<br>
<br>Beit pursued interests other than politics and commerce. With a genuine love of beautiful things he formed from 1888 onwards, under the guidance of Dr Bode, director of the Berlin Museum, a fine collection of pictures and works of art, including Italian Renaissance bronzes. He finally housed these treasures in a mansion in Park Lane, which the architect Eustace Balfour built for him in 1895. He had a thorough knowledge of painting, and among his pictures were the <span class="roman">Prodigal Son</span> series of Murillo, six pictures acquired from Lord Dudley's Gallery, and many of the finest examples of the Dutch and English schools.<br>
<br>On Rhodes's death in March 1902 Beit succeeded to much of his friend's position. He became the chief figure on the boards of the De Beers Company and of the chartered company, which he rejoined in that year. Beit was also one of Rhodes's trustees under his will. But his health had long been poor, and in the autumn of 1903, when he visited southern Africa for the purpose of examining the administration of Rhodesia, he suffered a stroke near Salisbury. Attended by Dr Jameson, he rallied but never fully recovered. His interests, however, were unslackened. Beit identified himself with the movements for a better understanding with Germany and for tariff reform. He bore witness to his colonial interests by founding at Oxford in 1905 the Beit professorship of colonial history and the Beit assistant lectureship in colonial history, besides giving a sum of money to the Bodleian Library for additions to its collections of books on colonial history. In the early spring of 1906 he was sent to Wiesbaden on account of heart trouble, but by his own wish he was brought home to England, a dying man, and passed away at his country residence, Tewin Water, Welwyn, Hertfordshire, on 16 July 1906. He was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
<br>Beit, who was unmarried, was survived by his mother, two sisters, and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30677/', "Sir Otto Beit (1865&#150;1930)")</script>; while providing liberally for various relatives and friends he left the residue of his fortune to his brother. At the same time his public benefactions, amounting in value to &pound;2,000,000, were impressive alike by their generosity to England and Germany, and by their breadth of view. To the Imperial College of Technology, London, he left &pound;50,000 in cash and De Beers shares, valued at the testator's death at &pound;84,843 15<i>s</i>. To Rhodesia, for purposes of education and charity, &pound;200,000 was bequeathed to be administered by trustees. King Edward's Hospital Fund and the trustees of Guy's Hospital were left &pound;20,000 each. Rhodes University at Grahamstown received &pound;25,000, Rhodes Memorial Fund &pound;10,000, and the Union Jack Club, London, &pound;10,000. Funds for benefactions in the Transvaal, in Kimberley, and Cape Colony were also established. Two sums of &pound;20,000 were left to his executors for distribution to the charities of London and Hamburg respectively. Finally &pound;1,200,000 passed to trustees for the extension of railway and telegraph communication in South Africa, with a view to forwarding the enterprise known as the Cape to Cairo railway. Beit made his public bequests elastic. Thus, while bequeathing an estate at Hamburg as a pleasure ground to the people of that city, he provided that twenty years later Hamburg might realize the estate and apply the proceeds to such other public objects as might seem desirable. Two of the bequests&#151;&pound;200,000 for a university at Johannesburg and &pound;50,000 destined for an Institute of Medical Sciences&#151;lapsed into the residuary estate owing to the schemes in question being abandoned, but Otto Beit intimated his intention of devoting the &pound;200,000 to university education in South Africa, and the &pound;50,000 was made by him the nucleus of a fund of &pound;215,000, with which he founded in 1909 thirty Alfred Beit fellowships for medical research in memory of the testator. Beit also left parts of his art collections to the National Gallery in London, to the Kaiserliche Museum in Berlin, and to the Hamburg Museum.<br>
<br>A wealthy financier of abnormal intuition and power of memory, combined with thoroughness of method, Beit was an extraordinarily successful mining magnate. While the full extent of his speculative interests have yet to be established, his investments in the Rand decisively influenced key money markets. Shy and retiring to excess, he was devoid of social ambition, and was little known beyond a small circle of intimates who included men in high positions such as Lord Rosebery and Lord Haldane. An ardent belief in the great causes of his day led him to distribute vast sums of money, but his benefactions were always made privately with rare self-effacement. Because of his close association with Rhodes, he was the target through life for much abuse, some deserved, some not.<br>
