<span class="headword">Callender,  Sheila Theodora Elsie</span>  (1914&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physician and haematologist</span>, was born on 5 April 1914 at Inverard, High View Road, Sidcup Hill, Sidcup, Kent, the youngest of the four children of Thomas Marshall Callender, general practitioner, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth Marie Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hoysted. Her father was of Scottish and her mother of Irish descent. After a broad secondary school education she received the Scottish universities' entrance board certificate in April 1932 and enrolled to study science and medicine at St Andrews University, from which she graduated BSc in 1935 and MB ChB in 1938, with commendation and a gold medal as the best student of her year.<br>
<br>After holding a number of junior hospital posts at Dundee Royal Infirmary, Callender obtained a Rockefeller travelling research fellowship which enabled her to train with Carl Moore, the distinguished American haematologist, at St Louis, USA. On her return from the USA she joined Leslie Witts as house physician in the newly formed Nuffield department of clinical medicine at Oxford University, where she remained for the remainder of her career. In 1947 she was appointed May reader in medicine at Oxford, and from 1954 onwards was first assistant and later clinical reader in the department. On 9 February 1957 she married Ivan Gyula &Aacute;rp&aacute;d Monostori, a 27-year-old medical student who had come to Oxford as a refugee following the Russian invasion of Hungary. They established beautiful homes in Oxford (latterly in Butts Road, Horspath) and Scotland, where they shared their interest in country life, gardening, fine wine, and a collection of rather terrifying mastiffs. They had no children.<br>
<br>Sheila Callender had an extremely distinguished career as a doctor and clinical scientist with a particular interest in diseases of the blood. In 1944 she received the degree of MD at St Andrews University, with a gold medal for her work on the anaemia of pregnancy. She was elected FRCP in 1962 and made DSc by the University of Oxford for her published works in 1970. Among her seminal contributions to the understanding of blood diseases were the first identity of the Lutheran and Willis blood groups in collaboration with Rob Race, an improved method for the determination of the lifespan of red blood cells, and many extremely important observations about how iron is absorbed and the effects of iron overload in a wide variety of diseases. Her work on iron absorption was of particular importance, reflecting as it did completely new approaches to the considerable technical problems of assessing iron absorption in human beings and in developing approaches to measure iron balance. She also made important contributions to the management of iron overload and to an understanding of the pathogenesis of some of the common forms of anaemia due to iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid deficiency. When Leslie Witts became chairman of the Medical Research Council's leukaemia trials committee she played a crucial role in helping him to develop some of the early and extremely successful studies of different drug regimes for the treatment of leukaemia. Throughout her research career she was an excellent supervisor of young clinical scientists in training, many of whom went on to develop successful careers in academic medicine or haematology, including J. M. Biggs, R. M. Bannerman, J. S. Malpas, J. M. Holt, A. L. Turnbull, and M. J. Pippard.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly, while at the peak of her scientific career Callender could have been appointed to almost any chair of medicine or haematology in the UK that attracted her. However, she was a retiring person who never wished to be in the limelight or to direct a large clinical academic department. Rather she preferred to devote her time to her patients and to her clinical research activities, together with a major teaching load. Hence she was of enormous support to the three Nuffield professors of medicine under whom she served. Sheila Callender was one of the last of the line of general physicians and haematologists who, on both sides of the Atlantic, did so much to establish and develop the field in the period after the Second World War. Her broad-based approach to medical practice made her an extremely popular teacher, an accomplishment which was helped by her warm personality and care for the progress of her students. Her wide background of interests, including music and literature, and, above all, her deep and sympathetic understanding of the problems of sick people, were reflected in her excellence as a clinician; her death, at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 17 August 2004, of leukaemia, was mourned by generations of her patients and students. She was survived by her husband, Ivan.<br>
