<span class="headword">Cecil, Lady  Gwendolen  Gascoyne-</span>  (1860&#150;1945), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born on 2 July 1860 at 21 Fitzroy Square, London, the second of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32339/', "Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, third marquess of Salisbury (1830&#150;1903)")</script>, the leading Conservative statesman, and his wife, Georgina Caroline (1827&#150;1899), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/303/', "Sir Edward Hall Alderson")</script>, a baron of the exchequer. Lady Gwendolen had no formal education, but her home, Hatfield House, gave an exceptional schooling in history, religion, and politics. In her thirties, as her mother's health declined, she became increasingly her father's confidante and amanuensis and accompanied him on official trips. In 1906 she began work on her great achievement, his biography. Four volumes, lucid and magisterial, with stylistic echoes of Creighton and Macaulay, appeared between 1921 and 1932.<br>
<br>Although inevitably partial, the <span class="italic">Life of Robert, Marquis of Salisbury</span> is not hagiography. Its language is impersonal, its scholarship massive. Lady Gwendolen's analysis of Salisbury's religion is unequalled and she writes with the authority of one who often discussed with him and his colleagues such matters as the Eastern question, parliamentary reform, and imperial expansion. Her summings-up of the politics of Disraeli (in volume 1) and Chamberlain (in the final, unpublished volume) are invaluable. Subsequent research may uncover much more, but her <span class="italic">Life</span> will remain pre-eminent in the genre of family and contemporary biography.<br>
<br>Besides historical activities, religion and philanthropy were the centre of Lady Gwendolen's existence. She fought for the release of unnecessarily incarcerated mental patients and designed many cottages on the Hatfield estate. On the political scene, passionately though she felt&#151;particularly where her brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32338/', "James Edward Hubert Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, William Gascoyne-Cecil (1863&#150;1936), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32335/', "(Edgar Algernon) Robert Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32336/', "Edward Herbert Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32337/', "Hugh Richard Heathcote Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, were involved&#151;about such topics as women's suffrage (which she favoured), she was more commentator than participant; but her judgements in her letters well deserve the historian's respect&#151;for example on the Liberals' 1906 election victory and on the causes of the First World War.<br>
<br>Stories of Lady Gwendolen's eccentricities abound. Once she stood in front of her car to prevent it from running downhill and was run over by it. She never married. Devotion to her father and an over-close family circle fostered by her dominating mother may be one reason; her unfeminine appearance, noble and dignified with advancing years, another. In some ways she conformed to the type of the late-Victorian maiden lady, but it would be absurd to see the richly textured life of this humorous, much loved, and scholarly woman as unfulfilled. Lady Gwendolen Cecil died at her home, the Lodge House, Hatfield Park, on 28 September 1945 and was buried in Hatfield parish churchyard.<br>
