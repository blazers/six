<span class="headword">Pyne,  Valentine</span>  (1603&#150;1677), <span class="occ">naval officer and soldier</span>, the second son of George Pyne, an ordnance officer of Curry Mallet, Somerset, was the first cousin of John Pyne, the revolutionary MP who was to be notably absent from Valentine's will. A lesser landed family claiming ancient lineage, the Pynes had become established in Tudor times. Valentine's uncle Hugh Pyne had a record of political dissent under Charles I.<br>
<br>Valentine Pyne served with his father as an officer of the ordnance in the expedition to Cadiz in 1625, and in 1627 in the expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;. He was almost certainly the Valentine Pyne serving in the navy in the 1630s, master of the <i>Jonas</i> in 1637, and connected with Sir John Pennington who apparently brought him to the notice of Sir Edward Nicholas. He served with Charles I during the civil war but his activities during the interregnum are unknown. He received royal favour after 1660, probably owing to his loyalty, expertise, and royalist connections, being appointed a gunner in the Ordnance office in 1661 and master gunner of England in 1666. He was praised by Pepys for his conduct in keeping his post at Chatham during the Dutch attack on the Medway in 1667.<br>
<br>Pyne died, unmarried, on 30 April 1677. His will, made six years before his death, disposed of &pound;2000 among his extended family while recognizing approximately the same amount in debts, reflecting the fact that ordnance gunnery was a genteel but middling occupation. A mural tablet was erected to his memory in the chapel of the Tower of London.<br>
<br>Pyne's life was one of service and modest profit within the naval&#150;military interface of his time. Loyalty, courage, and humour were his discernible characteristics. He left &pound;40 to his cousin George &#145;to be spent in idle company in drink and tobacco&#146; and &pound;50 to his cousin Grace &#145;to be cast away upon the first idle fellow that makes a suit unto her&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/354/52). Pyne has been confused with his naval cousin Captain Valentine Pyne (referred to in the former's will as &#145;being much at sea&#146;) who served in Rupert's fleet during the interregnum, commanded various vessels in the Restoration navy, and fought in the Second Anglo-Dutch War.<br>
