<span class="headword">Canterbury,  Odo  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1200), <span class="occ">theologian and abbot of Battle</span>, was probably a native of Kent. All that is known of his immediate family is that his brother Adam and a close relative (perhaps an uncle) named Ralph were Cistercian monks at Igny; another kinsman, John, was chaplain of Harrietsham in Kent.<h2>
<a name="MonkofChristChurch"></a>Monk of Christ Church</h2>The first notices of Odo occur when he was already a Benedictine monk at Christ Church Priory, Canterbury. They are by John of Salisbury, who was in the service of three successive archbishops of Canterbury from soon after 1147 until 1176. In his <span class="italic">Entheticus maior</span>, probably composed <i>c</i>.1155, John writes warmly of certain Canterbury monks, among them Odo, who &#145;is an avid reader of books, yet most of all loves those which speak of Christ&#146;  (trans. van Laarhoven, 1675&#150;6); and in the <span class="italic">Entheticus in Policraticum</span>, finished before September 1159, he tells his book to go to Canterbury and &#145;If you are able, convey my best wishes to Odo&#146;  (pp. 191&#150;2). Late in 1164 or soon after John, now in exile with his master Thomas Becket, wrote to a Master Odo in England, evidently no mean biblical scholar. By this date the epithet &#145;master&#146; frequently implied time spent in the schools, and if John's addressee was Odo of Canterbury, it could mean that he had had formal scholastic training, probably at Paris.<br>
<br>By now (and since 1163 at least) Odo was sub-prior of Christ Church. He had made a good start in his vocation as a monk; but for the next seven years his career and reputation were to suffer as he struggled to find a middle way through the dispute between Henry II and Archbishop Thomas Becket. In 1163 the archbishop sent him to Rome to protest on his behalf against the claim of the archbishop of York to the right to carry his cross in the southern province. In 1166, however, the convent was ordered by the royal justices to appeal against Becket; in 1167 Odo wrote to Richard of Ilchester, archdeacon of Poitiers and a royal official, explaining the difficulty of his position and pleading for help. In the meantime he and Prior Wibert were recipients of a letter from John of Salisbury, chiding them for withholding financial support for the legal expenses of the exiled archbishop.<h2>
<a name="CandidateforCanterbury"></a>Candidate for Canterbury</h2>Odo was himself chosen as prior soon after 16 May 1168, but without the archbishop's assent. Becket wished to depose him, and late in 1169 Odo felt obliged to withdraw for a time from Christ Church. He now incurred the pope's displeasure, first for allegedly disregarding the papal prohibition of the young king's coronation on 24 May 1170, and later for even aiding and abetting Becket's death. The martyred Becket was said to have foretold Odo's impending removal from Canterbury to a Christ Church monk, who in his prayers complained of the prior's lack of firmness. None the less, like John of Salisbury himself, Odo continued to maintain a moderate stance. On 21 December 1171 he succeeded in having Christ Church freed from the ecclesiastical censure passed on it because of the archbishop's murder within its walls. At this stage he must have had the support of at least a majority of his monks, for in the following year they began a long and fruitless campaign to have Odo elected as Becket's successor.<br>
<br>Gervase of Canterbury recounts the wearisome and inconclusive series of meetings in England and Normandy, between the king and the monks led by Odo himself, from September 1172 until April 1173. Odo, in a firm but courteous speech, defended their right of &#145;free election&#146; and their tradition of having a monk as archbishop, blaming the king's unilateral appointment of a secular clerk&#151;Becket&#151;for the troubles that had followed. The king did not at this stage reveal his will, but it would not be surprising if the speech displeased him. Eventually the monks were ordered to meet with the bishops of the province. At the meeting, held in May 1173, the monks put forward as their preferred candidates Odo and Richard, prior of Dover. Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London, as the bishops' spokesman, praised Odo, but none the less expressed their preference for Richard. This may have represented the king's real wishes, for Richard of Dover was one of two monks sent to the king with a message from the council. Possibly Odo too understood this, for Richard was formally elected on 3 June, and Odo wrote to the pope on the convent's behalf supporting &#145;their&#146; choice.<h2>
<a name="AbbotofBattle"></a>Abbot of Battle</h2>On 5 September 1174 Christ Church was destroyed by fire. On 1 July 1175 Odo attended a royal council at Woodstock, hoping to obtain, in place of the monastery's burned charters, new ones worded similarly to the exemplary privileges of Battle Abbey (which were in fact forgeries). For this purpose the monks of Battle were summoned to be present. As it happened, their abbey had been without a head for four years, and the monks, impressed by Odo's demeanour, nominated him as their abbot. At first Odo refused the position, but after due persuasion yielded, and was elected on 10 July. Odo arrived at Battle on 4 August, receiving the blessing from Archbishop Richard on Sunday 28 September, at Malling. In the following year Odo was summoned to Westminster by the papal legate, Cardinal Hugo Pierleone, to defend the abbey's right to the patronage of the church of Wye against Geoffrey de Lacy. He appealed in vain for assistance to Gerard Pucelle, afterwards bishop of Lichfield, to Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, and to John of Salisbury. But at last Waleran, the future bishop of Rochester, pleaded Odo's cause, and, Gerard now supporting him, effected a compromise.<br>
<br>When Archbishop Richard died in 1184 the monks of Canterbury once more nominated Odo for archbishop, and again the king refused to accept him. The new archbishop was Baldwin of Forde, who was soon involved in a serious quarrel with the monks over his intention to found a collegiate church at Hackington near Canterbury. On 13 January 1187 Odo was appointed by Pope Urban III as one of the commissioners to remonstrate with Baldwin, and on 1 March he was directed to ensure that the archbishop obeyed the papal mandate ordering him to restore to the monks revenues that he had appropriated for the use of his new church. Baldwin's response was equivocal, and the commissioners contented themselves with rescinding a sentence of deposition already pronounced by him against the prior. Once again Odo found himself caught in the crossfire between the pope and the king's representatives, with his attempted moderation judged unsatisfactory by others.<br>
<br>On 9 May Urban rebuked Odo for his lukewarmness, and sent a fresh mandate. The justiciar Ranulf de Glanville, however, forbade Odo to act, and in July the monks complained to Urban that Odo and his colleagues were prevaricating out of fear, and needed explicit instructions if they were to act with the firmness expected of them. On 3 October the pope sent another mandate to the archbishop, with instructions to the commissioners to ensure its execution. Odo does not figure in the dispute after this date, although in January 1188 the monks made a final appeal to him for assistance. On 3 September of the following year Odo was at Westminster for the coronation of Richard I. In January 1192, when the see of Canterbury was again vacant, the monks turned to him once more for support in the assertion of their right of free election. Odo died on 20 or 21 January 1200. He was buried in Battle Abbey, where John Leland saw his tomb, a slab of black Lydd marble.<h2>
<a name="Amodelabbot"></a>A model abbot</h2>This bare chronicle of events gives little hint of the man's character. In public life he was obviously by temperament a moderate, whether through wisdom or weakness. Despite that he was evidently held in high esteem by John of Salisbury, by the monks of Canterbury and Battle, but not by Henry II or Thomas Becket. In the end he was remembered, and has in modern times been characterized, not for his public role, but as a model monastic leader: prudent, eloquent, learned, and devout. The Battle Abbey chronicler says that, although he was strict in life and conversation, he consorted freely with his monks; only he did not sleep in the dormitory, because he suffered from a disorder of the stomach which he had to doctor privately. He praises Odo for his humility and modesty, and for his diligence in expounding the scriptures, saying that he could preach alike in French, Latin, and English.<br>
<br>Odo's conservative Benedictine background, his learning, and interest in preaching and biblical exposition are reflected in his surviving writings which, though not widely disseminated, survive in a handful of manuscripts written in or soon after his lifetime, both in England and on the continent. His commentary on <span class="italic">Kings</span>, probably written at the end of his life, was never completed and is very likely no more than a draft, given the absence of a prologue and its restricted and repetitive vocabulary. None the less it illustrates his profound knowledge of the scriptures, and suggests that he may even have known some Hebrew. But he could clearly write better than this, and the prologue to his sermon collection is a late example of the elegant monastic style of Latinity which owed much to Anselm and Bec.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>These last two works, and an unprinted commentary on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, are certainly Odo's; other attributions are uncertain, owing to confusion with writers of the same name, notably Odo of Cheriton, Eudes de Morimond (<i>d</i>. 1161), and Eudes de Ch&acirc;teauroux (<i>d</i>. 1273). The following works&#151;excluding some which are certainly not his&#151;are attributed to Odo of Canterbury: 1 Commentary on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, unprinted; copies listed in Sharpe, 402. <span class="roman">Genesis</span>&#150;<span class="roman">Numbers</span> only are in CUL, MS Dd.7.15 (early 13th century, ascribed to Odo); Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 54 (late 12th century, ascribed to Odo); Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 331, fols. 1&#150;168 (St Albans, 1250&#150;1300, ascribed to Eudes de Morimond); and Oxford, All Souls College, MS 12 (12th&#150;13th century, ascribed to Isidore). Cambridge, Queens' College, MS 8 (late 12th century, with a 14th century ascription to Haimo), also contains <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span>, though the attribution is uncertain. Other copies are attested at the monastic houses of Christ Church, Canterbury, Waverley, and Warden. 2 Commentary on <span class="roman">Kings</span>, ed. C. de Clercq as <span class="italic">Le commentaire d'Odon de Canterbury sur les livres des Rois</span>, Centre des Recherches Historiques (Ventimiglia, 1980), from the only surviving manuscript, CUL, Gg.4.17 (Christ Church, Canterbury, 13th century); Leland saw another copy at Battle Abbey. 3 &#145;Odo prior de moribus ecclesiae&#146;, not known to survive (copy recorded at Christ Church, Canterbury, early 13th century). 4 Letters: to Richard of Ilchester, in <span class="italic">Patrologia Latina</span>, 190.1003&#150;5; to his brother Adam, then a novice at Igny, in J. Mabillon, <span class="italic">Vetera Analecta</span> (1675&#150;85), vol. 1, pp. 349&#150;59; to accompany a copy of Benedict's miracles of St Thomas sent to Adam and Ralph, in Robertson and Sheppard, vol. 2, p. xlix; to Pope Alexander III, in JS, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, no. 311, pp. 760&#150;67. 5 Sermons: Twenty sermons with a prologue, addressed to Odo's brother Adam (in which the collection is called &#145;Solacium peregrinorum&#146;), in Bruges, Grand S&eacute;minaire, MS 406, fols. 1&#150;123<i>v</i>; the prologue ed. A. Pattin, &#145;Un manuscrit du xiie si&egrave;cle de l'ancienne abbaye d'Eename retrouv&eacute;&#146; (Bruges, Grand S&eacute;minaire, MS 406), <span class="italic">Scriptorium</span>, 44 (1990), 79&#150;91. The same sermons, with seven more, from fourteen other manuscripts, ed. C. de Clercq, <span class="italic">The Latin Sermons of Odo of Canterbury</span> (Brussels, 1983); Pattin questions the authenticity of the seven sermons edited by de Clercq not in the Bruges manuscript; all twenty-seven are listed in J. B. Schneyer, <span class="italic">Repertorium der lateinischen Sermones des Mittelalters</span>, 11 vols. (M&uuml;nster, 1969&#150;90), vol. 4, pp. 392&#150;4. A collection was seen by Leland at Waverley. 6 Odo of Canterbury may be identifiable with the Englishman named Odo who, between 1140 and 1148, probably wrote the anti-Jewish theological <i>summa</i> called <span class="italic">Ysagoge in theologiam</span>, ed. A. Landgraf, &#145;&Eacute;crits th&eacute;ologiques de l'&eacute;cole d'Ab&eacute;lard&#146;, <span class="italic">Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense</span>, 14 (1934), 61&#150;298. On its authorship and characteristics see D. E. Luscombe, &#145;The authorship of the <i>Ysagoge in theologiam</i>&#146;, <span class="italic">Archives d'Histoire Doctrinale et Litt&eacute;raire du Moyen &Acirc;ge</span>, 35 (1969), 7&#150;16; and D. E. Luscombe, <span class="italic">The School of Peter Abelard</span> (1969), 236&#150;44.<br>
