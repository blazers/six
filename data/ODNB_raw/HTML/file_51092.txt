<span class="headword">Hatch,  John Charles</span>, Baron Hatch of Lusby  (1917&#150;1992), <span class="occ">author and politician</span>, was born in Stockport, Cheshire, on 1 November 1917, the son of John James Hatch (1864&#150;1939), temperance advocate, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White (1886&#150;1980), headmistress. Although Lancashire-born he was brought up in Yorkshire, and his early education was at Keighley Boys' Grammar School. He graduated from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1942 and, rejecting military service, became a tutor with the National Council of Labour Colleges. From 1944 to 1948 he was national organizer of the Independent Labour Party and a lecturer at Glasgow University. On 1 November 1941 he married Laura Alberta Brown (<i>b</i>. 1915), a nurse, and daughter of Jonathan Brown, an engine driver. There were two sons of the marriage, which ended in divorce.<br>
<br>In 1954 Hatch was appointed head of the Commonwealth department of the Labour Party, and in 1961 he became director of the extra-mural department of the University of Sierra Leone. From 1964 to 1970 he was the founder director of the African studies programme at Houston, Texas, and from 1980 to 1982 director of the department of human relations at Zambia University. Later he became honorary lecturer in the school of development studies at the University of East Anglia. He knew most of the African leaders before they were leaders, and he became political adviser to men he had taught as students, including Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda. He recognized the quality of Nelson Mandela and was tireless in demands for his release from prison long before the true stature of the man was generally accepted. Later Mandela invited him to the first post-banning meeting of the African National Congress, where he was greeted as an honoured guest. He had, of course, been banned from South Africa during the years of apartheid. On this last visit to Africa he also stayed with Kenneth Kaunda, accompanied by his second wife, Evangelia (Eva) Grant (<i>b</i>. 1924), a divorced lecturer and guide and daughter of Theodore Copellos, a stage manager, whom Hatch had married on 29 May 1991. Hatch was Commonwealth correspondent of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> from 1950 to 1970, and his books included <span class="italic">The Dilemma of South Africa</span> (1953), <span class="italic">A History of Post-War Africa</span> (1964), <span class="italic">The History of Britain in Africa</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Tanzania</span> (1969), <span class="italic">Nigeria</span> (1971), <span class="italic">Africa Emergent</span> (1974), and <span class="italic">Two African Statesmen</span> (1976).<br>
<br>Hatch's life, however, was not confined to political endeavour. He was keen on sport, particularly cricket and rugby football, and was a referee for rugby union at senior level. Needless to say, when a tour of the Springboks from South Africa was arranged Hatch made it publicly clear that he would not be available. Some of his fellow members of the county championship panel thought he was being immodest in supposing himself to be on the shortlist of referees for the tour, but others agreed with him that in avoiding a possible choice and refusal scene he was simply being sensible. Certainly there were few people less interested in personal publicity.<br>
<br>The shape of Hatch's career precluded parliamentary candidature for the Commons, but he was delighted when in 1978 he was created Baron Hatch of Lusby and thus enabled to further, at the place of government, causes dear to his heart while still in full possession of his considerable, indeed exceptional, abilities. He was a formidable presence in the Lords, calm and burly, but not fat. When he spoke in his deep voice from his place high on the top back bench, noteless and unhurried, the house listened. Even those irritated by his explicit exposure of cherished beliefs as questionable if not fallacious could only put their heads in their hands, for experience showed that Hatch would seize on interruption to argue his case at even greater length. He would not sit down until he was good and ready, even when his own front bench was showing signs of becoming restive. On one occasion his fellow peers were forced to use a little-known device, &#145;that the Noble Lord be heard no longer&#146;. We had adjacent desks in a room with eight others, which was said to contain the nearest thing to a left wing the Lords was likely to experience. There John explained to me that in a time-limited debate he would always take slightly less than his allotted five minutes, or whatever it was, but if he took part in an unrestricted discussion he alone would determine the extent of his contribution. As he did his homework and seldom strayed outside the range of his own expertise that seemed reasonable, even if it sometimes strained the patience of the less tolerant or more percipient.<br>
<br>Hatch remained active until his death from heart failure on 11 October 1992 in a London hospital. He donated his body to London University for medical research, and his remains were subsequently cremated. He was survived by his second wife, and by Stuart and Barrie, the two sons of his first marriage. Although personally agnostic, Hatch respected and enjoyed the friendship of many believers, and a memorial service was conducted by the Revd Lord Soper at St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster, on 19 January 1993. Among those who spoke were the Most Revd Trevor Huddleston, the Zambia high commissioner, lords Pitt and Judd, the dean of the school of development studies at the University of East Anglia, and Hatch's fellow agnostic, the present writer. Hatch will be remembered as a man of total integrity, a true internationalist of proud commitment to his socialist conviction.<br>
