<span class="headword">Reading,  John</span>  (1587/8&#150;1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Buckinghamshire of &#145;sufficient parents&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.794). He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 4 May 1604, aged sixteen, graduated BA on 17 October 1607, and proceeded MA from St Mary Hall on 22 June 1610. In February 1612 he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Oxford and on 19 June 1614 he was made a priest. About the same time he became chaplain to Edward la Zouche, Lord Zouche, from July 1615 warden of the Cinque Ports and governor of Dover Castle. He moved to Dover, where on 2 December 1616 he was made minister of St Mary the Virgin at the request of the parishioners who were, according to Wood, &#145;very much taken with his preaching&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.794). In 1621 he described this congregation as &#145;zealous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Mans Staff</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). Some time after 1625 he seems to have been appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles I and to have received a BD from one of the universities. By 1627 he had married: a son, William, was baptized at St Mary's on 14 December that year.<br>
<br>In the 1620s and 1630s Reading published a number of pamphlets based on sermons that he had given at St Mary's. <span class="italic">A Faire Warning</span> (1621), dedicated to Lucy Russell, countess of Bedford, indicates that he had recently recovered from a serious illness. <span class="italic">The Old Mans Staff</span> (1621), a meditation on &#145;the dignitie belonging to the aged&#146;, was dedicated to Lord Zouche. On election day 1626 he preached a sermon which argued that the &#145;late visitations&#146; of God were the punishment for the &#145;cursed libertie of sinning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Moses and Jethro</span>, 1626, sig. A2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). <span class="italic">Davids Soliloquie</span> (1627), dedicated to Lady Sara Hastings, a member of his congregation, seems to suggest that he had been (and perhaps still was) plagued with melancholy&#151;it is possible that this is the illness to which he referred in <span class="italic">A Faire Warning</span>. On 21 September 1637 he preached the funeral sermon of Alice Percivall, the wife of his friend Anthony Percivall, controller of customs for Kent, later published as <span class="italic">Characters of True Blessednesse</span> (1638). In 1638 he questioned a suspected Catholic priest who had arrived in Dover from Flanders, and in the following year he informed Archbishop William Laud about a freemason who had &#145;spread sundry opinions repugnant to the doctrine of the Church of England&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638&#150;9</i>, 156; <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 80&#150;81).<br>
<br>Reading, a &#145;severe Calvinist&#146;, was a good preacher &#145;very much resorted to for his frequent and edifying sermons, and held in great esteem by the neighbourhood, especially by the puritanical party&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.794). During the early 1640s, however, he preached forcefully against rebellion and in favour of the king. On 23 August 1641 he delivered an assize sermon at Maidstone in Kent, published as <span class="italic">A Sermon Delivered</span> (1642), which condemned the &#145;state-threatening schismaticks&#146; and took as its motto <span class="roman">Romans</span> 16:17, &#145;I beseech you brethren, marke them who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, and avoid them&#146;  (pp. 1, 4). The address seems to have caused offence to many of those who heard it and Reading subsequently claimed that his only desire had been to &#145;perswade to an holy unity in Christ&#146;. He dedicated this pamphlet to the royalists Sir Thomas Mallet and Sir Edward Dering, and added his &#145;hearty prayers for the good successe of &hellip; [their] &hellip; prudent endevaours&#146; in the Commons  (sig. A3<i>v</i>, A4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In April 1642 Reading's &#145;study of books&#146; was plundered by the Kent militia and in November of the same year he was &#145;taken violently by soldiers out of his study &hellip; and sent to prison and banishment for a year and seven months&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>). He may have been imprisoned in the Tower during this period. On 27 January 1643 the king wrote to Archbishop Laud asking him to bestow the parsonage of Chartham, Kent, upon Reading &#145;now beneficed at Dover but deprived of his small livelihood by the perverse disposition of some of his turbulent parishioners&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;3</i>, 440). The Commons blocked this appointment and, at the same time, passed an ordinance sequestering Laud's temporalities. Reading was then appointed to a prebend in Canterbury Cathedral, but does not seem to have taken possession of this office. His <span class="italic">A Grain of Incense</span>, which George Thomason bought on 8 April 1643, called for God's blessing upon the king and asked him to grant &#145;an happy Understanding and Accord&#146; between the king and &#145;His great Counsell the Parliament&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>&#150;4<i>r</i>). Reading's <span class="italic">Evening Sacrifice or Prayer</span>, which Thomason bought on 5 August 1643, called for God's blessing on the royal family but did not make any mention of parliament.<br>
<br>In July 1644 Sir William Brockman presented Reading to the parsonage of Cheriton, Kent, and about the same time he was appointed by the assembly of divines to be one of the nine clergymen to write annotations on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. At some point in late 1644 or early 1645 the authorities discovered a royalist plot to seize Dover Castle, and Reading was &#145;inhumanely seized on in a cold winter night in his house&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>). He was held overnight in Dover Castle and then consigned to Leeds Castle where he wrote <span class="italic">A Guide to the Holy City</span>, which was published in 1651. On 8 January 1647 he was a prisoner in the Fleet. The parliamentary committee for Kent ordered his release at an unspecified date, and although his personal goods were returned to him his livings were sequestered. However, despite the refusal of the committee for plundered ministers on 24 August 1647 to entertain his petition to be restored, his son William claimed in an exchequer deposition of 1652 that Reading was rector of Cheriton and had been for eight years.<br>
<br>Donald Wing attributes <span class="italic">Little Benjamin, or, Truth Discovering Error</span> (1649) to Reading, but this is unlikely because <span class="italic">Little Benjamin</span> is a forceful defence of the regicide. Wing's attribution of <span class="italic">The Ranters Ranting</span> (1650) to Reading is more convincing, however. On 10 March 1650 he publicly debated with an Anabaptist named Samuel Fisher in Folkestone, Kent, concerning the right of Christians to &#145;preach the gospel without ecclesiastical ordination, or contrary to the commands of the civil magistrate&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>). Fisher argued for the motion and apparently took most of his arguments from Jeremy Taylor's <span class="italic">Liberty of Prophesying</span>. This experience led Reading to pen <span class="italic">An Antidote Against Anabaptism</span> (1654), an attack on the &#145;curiously impartial&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) section of Taylor's book which examined the opinions of the Anabaptists on infant baptism. Reading published an enlarged edition of <span class="italic">An Antidote</span> under the title <span class="italic">Anabaptism Routed</span> in 1655: both editions were dedicated to Sir William Brockman and his wife, Anne.<br>
<br>On 24 May 1660 Reading made a short speech and presented Charles II with a &#145;large <span class="roman">Bible</span> with gold clasps&#146; in the name of the corporation of Dover upon the king's return to England. Soon after he was restored to his prebend of Canterbury and the rectory of Chartham. He was restored to Cheriton on 18 July 1660, but resigned this living at an unknown date before August 1662. In October 1660 the king wrote to Oxford University requesting that Reading be awarded a DD. In 1660 he wrote <span class="italic">Christmas Revived</span>, a defence of &#145;the observation of a day in memorie of [the birth of] our Saviour&#146;  (p. 1), and three years later he published <span class="italic">A Sermon Lately Delivered</span> in Canterbury Cathedral in defence of &#145;Church-Musick&#146;. He died on 26 October 1667 and was buried four days later in the chancel of Chartham parish church. Anthony Wood provides interesting details of a number of manuscripts written by Reading but never published.<br>
