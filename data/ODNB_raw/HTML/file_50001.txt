<span class="headword">Eagles,  Fanny Elizabeth</span>  (1836&#150;1907), <span class="occ">Church of England deaconess</span>, was born on 10 December 1836 in Bedford, the youngest of the three children of Ezra Eagles (1804&#150;1865), solicitor, coroner, and clerk of the peace, and his wife, Elizabeth Halfhead (<i>c</i>.1804&#150;1866). Fanny survived both her brothers, the eldest, Ezra, dying in 1862 and her younger brother, Edward, in 1900. Fanny, being a delicate baby, was baptized privately, and was later received at St Peter's Church, Bedford. Her family was staunchly Anglican in a town which had strong nonconformist connections.<br>
<br>Nothing has been recorded of Fanny Eagles's early life except her confirmation at St Mary's, Bedford, by Bishop Thomas Turton of Ely in 1860. After the death of her father in 1865 and her mother in 1866, she decided to enter an Anglican sisterhood. As a member of St Paul's Church, Bedford, she had been influenced by the Revd John Donne and his successor, the Revd Michael Ferrebee Sadler, vicar since 1864. Sadler was a Tractarian who, as well as restoring the church building and introducing daily services, became a national figure within the Tractarian movement. It was he who dissuaded Fanny Eagles from joining a sisterhood and persuaded her to stay in Bedford and serve the poor there.<br>
<br>Initially, Fanny Eagles went to King's College Hospital, London, to train in nursing, and thence to St Peter's Home in Brompton Square to experience life in an Anglican sisterhood. But it was as a deaconess that she chose to fulfil her vocation, and on 5 February 1869 (seven years after the admission of the first Anglican deaconess) she was admitted in the palace chapel at Ely by Bishop Harold Browne in the presence of a few friends. She then returned to Bedford to work among the poor in St Paul's parish, using her home, St Loyes, together with a stable loft in Allhallows Lane. She founded the Ely Deaconess Institution at St Loyes but this body grew very slowly. In 1870 two deaconesses were admitted but numbers never exceeded more than half a dozen (the last died in 1934). Habited like religious sisters and living in a community bound by a rule, it was very difficult to distinguish them from Sisters of Mercy. They were always known as &#145;sister&#146;, which added to the confusion, and in the nonconformist environment of Bedford they encountered much prejudice.<br>
<br>At first the deaconesses ran Sunday schools, night schools for men and boys, guilds for young girls, and women's meetings. But in the winter of 1871&#150;2 Bedford was struck by a smallpox epidemic. Together with Harry Hocken, curate of St Paul's, Sister Fanny went into the homes of the sick to comfort and minister. They worked day and night for three months, often going where no other ministers would venture, and they frequently had to put the dead bodies into their coffins. A few months later their work was attacked by the minister of the Bunyan Meeting and dismissed as &#145;mimicries of the black veil and other monastic mummeries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bedford Times and Independent</span>, 28 May 1872). Despite these difficulties Sister Fanny was described as &#145;always cheerful, almost indeed exuberant in spirit and with a keen sense of humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bedfordshire Mercury</span>).<br>
<br>The work grew steadily and was assisted by the gift of a substantial house in Bromham Road, Bedford, provided by Anthony Gibbs of Bristol who had heard of her heroism in the epidemic. In 1881 the deaconess community moved from St Loyes to Bromham Road and soon afterwards Sister Fanny took in a homeless orphan girl. From this small beginning grew St Etheldreda's Home, which cared for about twenty children. In 1890 the home was extended by the addition of a chapel and refectory, and in 1907 the neighbouring house was acquired.<br>
<br>Sister Fanny died peacefully at St Etheldreda's on 7 March 1907, having been seriously ill for some time. Her funeral took place at St Paul's on 11 March in the presence of a large congregation, including many poor people, and was followed by interment in the family plot at Ampthill. She was described as a &#145;gentle, good woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bedfordshire Mercury</span>) whose work would long be remembered, and indeed St Etheldreda's Home continued until 1983. A friend wrote that &#145;Sr Fanny belonged to the same School as Harriet Monsell, Mother Susan (of St Peter's Community), Pusey and Keble&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Short Memoir</span>, 25). Sister Fanny was a pioneer of women's ministry at a time when both deaconesses and religious sisters were new in the Anglican church.<br>
