<span class="headword">Villiers,  Henry Montagu</span>  (1813&#150;1861), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle and of Durham</span>, was born in London on 4 January 1813. He was the fifth son of George Villiers (1759&#150;1827) and his wife, Theresa (1775&#150;1855), only daughter of John Parker, first Baron Boringdon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28297/', "George William Frederick Villiers, the fourth earl of Clarendon")</script> and foreign secretary, was his eldest brother. Nothing is known of Villiers's early education. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1830 and held a studentship there, graduating BA in 1834 and MA in 1837. He was awarded an Oxford DD in 1856. On 30 January 1837 he married Amelia Maria (1815&#150;1871), eldest daughter of William Hulton of Hulton Park, Lancashire, and they had a family of two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Villiers was ordained deacon in 1836 and became curate of Deane, Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire; on being ordained priest in 1837 he became the vicar of St Nicholas's, Kenilworth, Warwickshire. In 1841 the lord chancellor (Lord Lyndhurst) gave him the wealthy rectory of St George's, Bloomsbury, London, and in 1847 he became a canon residentiary of St Paul's Cathedral. In the 1840s he was described in a document prepared for J. T. Delane, the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, as perhaps &#145;the most influential clergyman in London&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. c. 290).<br>
<br>Shortly after ordination Villiers became an evangelical through a fellow curate, and on moving to Kenilworth was converted to Calvinism and premillennialism through William &#145;Millennial&#146; Marsh. From 1842 Villiers held annual Lent lectures on the second coming of Christ. A large, diverse congregation was attracted by his sermons, many of which were published. His <span class="italic">Balls and Theatres, or, The Duty of Reproving the Works of Darkness</span> was published in 1846 and achieved a fourth edition in the same year. He also gave lectures under the auspices of the Young Men's Christian Association and the Church of England Young Men's Society. A hard-working and able parish administrator, he had a team of curates and made use of lay workers and London City Missioners, and worked in close harmony with nonconformists.<br>
<br>Villiers was consecrated bishop of Carlisle in April 1856, the first of Lord Palmerston's episcopal appointments. Having authority over an enlarged diocese, he unified the ancient diocese of Carlisle with that of the northernmost part of the Chester diocese. He encouraged the appointment of Francis Close as the dean of Carlisle and the two men worked together in promoting the evangelical cause throughout the diocese. His diocesan appointments of archdeacons and rural deans were not, however, partisan.<br>
<br>Villiers encouraged greater personal piety among his clergy and raised the academic standard for those entering the diocese. But as the majority of livings were poor it was difficult to retain able clergy. He exercised discipline over drunken clergy, three of whom were dismissed. He encouraged monthly communion services and took pains over his confirmation services, and began the practice of confirming candidates from the English chapels in Scotland. He travelled extensively throughout his diocese and was also in demand elsewhere as a speaker. In 1857 he preached the first of a series of sermons to the working classes in Exeter Hall. Villiers was keen to improve elementary education in his diocese, in which he was supported by the activity of the philanthropist George Moore. Villiers was little involved in the politics of the day and rarely spoke in the House of Lords. With Lord Shaftesbury he was active in the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews.<br>
<br>He was translated to Durham in 1860 and began his work in earnest. However, in the following summer he became ill; he died within a fortnight on 9 August 1861 in Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, and was buried in the chapel there. His wife and family were left in financial difficulties and Amelia and her three unmarried daughters were given grace-and-favour accommodation at Hampton Court Palace. His eldest son, Henry Montagu Villiers (1841&#150;1908), became vicar of St Paul's, Knightsbridge.<br>
<br>The last six months of Villiers's life were blighted by the Cheese affair, and it may well have contributed to his early death. Edward Cheese (<i>d</i>. 1886) married Villiers's daughter Amy Maria in 1860. In February 1861 Villiers appointed his new son-in-law and domestic chaplain to the lucrative living of Haughton-le-Skerne, near Darlington. <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> accused Villiers of gross nepotism. He became the target of wounding criticism and was the subject of a cartoon in <span class="italic">Punch</span> (9 March 1861). Although he contemplated resignation, his friends encouraged him to remain as bishop. Bishop A. C. Tait saw him in a different light, as &#145;a man of rare charm and full of friendship&#146;  (E. H. Thomson, <span class="italic">Life and Letters of William Thomson</span>, 1919, 53).<br>
