<span class="headword">Lane,  Samuel</span>  (1780&#150;1859), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 26 July 1780 at King's Lynn, Norfolk, the oldest of the five children of Samuel Lane (1749&#150;1835), collector of taxes, and his wife, Elizabeth (1753&#150;1832), daughter of the Revd Anthony Mayhew. At the age of seven he became deaf following an accident, said to be a fall into the river mud near his home in Purfleet Street. As a result he was never able to speak distinctly. He later went to London, where he studied under Joseph Farington for three years, and on 21 June 1800 at the age of twenty he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools and became a pupil of Thomas Lawrence. From about 1802 he was employed by Lawrence as a studio assistant, although the arrangement was not without problems: &#145;I go on badly with Mr Lawrence. He does not employ me in a regular way, &amp; I lose much time in consequence of his being undetermined how to employ me&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 7.2751, 7 May 1806). Despite this, he remained with Lawrence for several years and at his death in 1830 Lane completed portraits left unfinished in his studio.<br>
<br>For most of his career Lane remained in London, living at 60 Greek Street, Soho. He contributed over 200 portraits to the Royal Academy, exhibiting almost every year between 1804 and 1857. In 1805 he received the freedom of King's Lynn after presenting to the corporation a portrait of George III, copied from the original portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He exhibited with the Norwich Society of Artists between 1819 and 1829 and in London with the British Institution in 1819 and the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in 1832. Lane's honest, if somewhat prosaic, likenesses attracted numerous commissions. He had a wide range of sitters. They ranged from the distinguished, such as Robert Southey (1824; Balliol College, Oxford), and the exotic, R&aacute;den R&aacute;na Dipura, a Javanese chief who accompanied Sir R. S. Raffles to England (exh. RA, 1818), to the infant son of Mr and Mrs Bartley of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (exh. RA, 1826). Several of the portraits were for presentation, for example a portrait of Luke Hansard (Palace of Westminster, London) painted in 1828 for the Stationers' Company and another of Thomas William Coke MP (priv. coll.) painted in 1832 for the Norwich Corn Exchange. Many were engraved by other artists. Lane retained his links with his native Norfolk, and carried out commissions for several wealthy families in the area. One of his sitters, the Revd Thomas Hankinson of King's Lynn, wrote in 1838 that he communicated with Lane in &#145;finger-talk&#146;. He continued: &#145;I like Lane very much, and were it not for his unfortunate infirmity should hold a good deal of interesting talk with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Samuel Lane Centenary</span>). Lane married three times. His first wife was Eliza (1802&#150;1831), daughter of Samuel Lillistone, merchant, of Beccles, Suffolk; they married at Barsham, Suffolk, on 3 September 1829. She died following the birth of their son in London in June 1831. Lane married, second, at St Pancras, on 3 March 1835, Catherine Jane (1803&#150;1839), daughter of Thomas Powys. Their son Horatio Powys Lane (1836&#150;1884) was later commissioned in the Madras Infantry and was the subject of a portrait by Lane (exh. RA, 1856). They also had two daughters. He married, third, at Petworth, Sussex, on 4 February 1840, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1800/01), daughter of Charles Murray. In 1853 he moved to Ipswich, where he died on 29 July 1859 at his home at 2 Paragon's Buildings, Lower Brook Street. He was buried in Ipswich cemetery, and was survived by his third wife.<br>
