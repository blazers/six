<span class="headword">Collinson,  James</span>  (1825&#150;1881), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born in Mansfield, near Nottingham, on 9 May 1825, the youngest of the three children of Robert Collinson (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;<i>c</i>.1830), a prosperous bookseller, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1785&#150;<i>c</i>.1860). Little is known about Collinson's father, who died during his childhood, which was spent in Nottinghamshire. By the time James Collinson was twenty years old the bookselling business had long been taken over by his married elder brother, Charles; his sister, Mary, was living with their mother, then aged about sixty, in a small house at Pleasley Hill just outside Mansfield. James was more than ten years younger than either of his siblings.<br>
<br>In the mid-1840s Collinson was a meek-mannered, fair-haired young man of diminutive stature and boyish appearance with a habit of falling asleep indiscriminately. Enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London, he met there the slightly younger Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt. They admired their fellow student's art, although Holman Hunt found him dull company, writing of Collinson in <span class="italic">Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</span> (1905) that &#145;he could but rarely see the fun of anything, although he sometimes laughed in a lachrymose manner, and I fear our attempts to enliven him were but futile&#146;  (1.161&#150;2). Drawn to the Oxford Movement which was reinvigorating high-church worship, Collinson was a devoted and pious worshipper at Christ Church, Albany Street. There he would have known, and been known by, if only by sight, Christina Rossetti and her mother, who attended the same church to listen to the fiery Puseyite sermons of the Revd William Dodsworth.<br>
<br>Collinson's painting <span class="italic">The Charity Boy's Debut</span> was exhibited in the Royal Academy exhibition in 1847 and much praised. A genre scene which showed a parish lad putting on his uniform, it was followed in 1848 by <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, a sentimental depiction of a girl child with two boys. <span class="italic">The New Curate</span> and <span class="italic">The Noviciate to a Nunnery</span> followed: most of Collinson's early work, like these two paintings, was heavily devotional. At about the same time that Dante Gabriel Rossetti, his brother William Michael, and the four other founder members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood asked him to join them, Collinson took what must have seemed a logical step forward from Tractarianism and converted to Roman Catholicism. Although described by William Rossetti as &#145;hardly a writing man&#146;  (Rossetti, 20), in March 1850 Collinson contributed quite an imaginative, five-part narrative poem entitled &#145;The Child Jesus&#146; to the second issue of <span class="italic">The Germ</span>, the short-lived Pre-Raphaelite journal. It was accompanied by an etching which showed a haloed, juvenile figure of Christ blessing other children; Collinson's reputation at the time was such that editor William Rossetti thought it worth flagging &#145;with an Etching by James Collinson&#146; on the front cover of the issue.<br>
<br>Collinson lodged in Somers Town and became a frequent visitor to the Rossetti family home at 50 Charlotte Street, where, in his hesitant way, he got to know Christina Rossetti better. He painted portraits of her and her sister Maria, presenting Christina as a prim nervous figure in stark contrast to the full-featured voluptuous portraits of her by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In 1848 he proposed marriage to Christina but was refused on the grounds of his Roman Catholicism. He reconverted to Anglicanism and was accepted, although Christina was only seventeen years old and Collinson was still financially dependent on his family. At the same time Collinson was working on his major Pre-Raphaelite painting <span class="italic">St Elizabeth of Hungary</span> (exh. 1851; Johannesburg Art Gallery, South Africa) which shows the saint entering a convent, rather than remarrying after the death of her devout husband.<br>
<br>In 1850 Collinson finished, in time for exhibition at the Royal Academy that year, his oil painting <span class="italic">Answering the Emigrant's Letter</span>. Now in the City of Manchester Art Galleries, it is a genre scene depicting a working man in shirt sleeves with his wife and children around a table in a dark kitchen. The three eldest children are poring over a letter to their absent elder brother. With <span class="italic">The Emigration Scheme</span> which was exhibited at Liverpool Academy in 1852 (ex Sothebys, 15 March 1967) it demonstrates Collinson's interest in the topical subject of emigration during the early 1850s.<br>
<br>Early in 1850 Collinson reverted to his Catholic faith and renounced the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and his connection with <span class="italic">The Germ</span>. He felt unable &#145;conscientiously as a Catholic to assist in parading the artistic opinions of those who are not&#146; as he explained in his resignation letter to Dante Gabriel Rossetti  (Thomas, 90). This left Christina with no choice but to release him from their engagement. A few months later he sold his painting materials and, in late 1852 or early 1853, entered the Jesuit community at Stonyhurst College at Clitheroe in Lancashire where he remained until some time before September 1854. By 1855 Collinson was once more exhibiting at the Royal Academy and two new pictures by him were shown at the British Institution in 1858, but he had no further contact with the Rossettis and their circle. On 9 February 1858 Collinson married Eliza Alvinia Henrietta Ann Wheeler at Brompton Oratory. She was a vigorous, plainly dressed Catholic aged forty, related by marriage to Collinson's friend J. R. Herbert. Collinson's only child, a son, Robert, was born in 1859.<br>
<br>Collinson exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and the Society of British Artists&#151;of which he was a fellow&#151;from 1855 until 1870, after which he lived quietly in retirement. Much of his post-Stonyhurst work was artistically unremarkable and concentrated on saleable domestic or humorous subjects. It is difficult to get an overview of Collinson's work as so much of it has been dispersed or is lost. One surviving work, <span class="italic">For Sale</span> (exh. RA, 1858), is now in the Tate collection: it depicts a girl opening her purse at a charity when the item really on sale is herself. It was a companion piece to a similar painting entitled <span class="italic">To Let</span> which showed a young woman offering lodgings in her house. Collinson died on 24 January 1881 at his home, 16 Paulet Road, Camberwell. He was survived by his wife.<br>
