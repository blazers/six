<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">pamphleteer and conspirator</span>, was the son of William Ferguson of Badifurrow in Aberdeenshire. He received a liberal education in his native land, probably at the University of Aberdeen, where in 1650 the name &#145;Robertus Fergusone Aberdonensis&#146; is entered in the record  (Ferguson, 13). He moved to England some time in the 1650s. For a time he supported himself teaching &#145;university learning&#146; in Islington, near London  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 60), and, according to Calamy, he was an assistant to John Owen, Independent preacher and chaplain to Oliver Cromwell. In a &#145;solemn meeting&#146; with Owen, Ferguson supposedly renounced his communion with the Church of Scotland, declaring that &#145;Presbytery was a head too big for the body&#146;  (Wodrow, 2.270&#150;71). Ferguson began preaching with Owen to large congregations at Moorfields, London.<br>
<br>In the early years of the Restoration Ferguson was active in the underground world of protestant dissenters in London, particularly around Cheapside and Moorfields. On 16 January 1663 a warrant was issued for his arrest for raising money in support of ejected ministers and other treasonable practices. He spent a few months in the Gatehouse and was liberated on 12 May when he entered a bond for &pound;3000 for his good behaviour  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 15, 20, 135). Shortly thereafter he seems to have begun informing on his own friends. His name appears in the &#145;spy book&#146; of the secretary of state, Sir Joseph Williamson, a list of the disaffected in and around London who were watched by the secretary's spies. One informant reports that <blockquote>the said Ferguson did inform me at several times that Mr Calamy and Mr Jenkins had a public stock for the encouragement of those ministers turned out [of the] city and country. And that the said Ferguson is one of their pensioners and he can inform of the rest and of their meetings at several places.</blockquote>Ferguson also warned the government of proposed insurrection led by presbyterians and Independents (&#145;Williamson's spy book&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Congregational Historical Society</span>, ed. T. G. Crippen, vol. 5, repr. 1969, spelling modernized, 306; also <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 12).<br>
<br>Despite his double dealing Ferguson remained an intimate of Owen. In the late 1660s he turned to writing religious tracts that supported nonconformity. His first treatise, <span class="italic">Justification Onely upon Satisfaction &hellip; of Christ, as the Alone Ground of Remission of Sin</span> (1668), was a precise and thoughtful defence of the doctrine of atonement. Under Owen's tutelage Ferguson published <span class="italic">The Interest of Reason in Religion, with the Import and Use of Scripture Metaphors</span> (1675), in which he defended nonconformists against the oft-made charge that they denied the place of reason in religious practice and belief. The treatise was a complex and sophisticated defence of revelation as supported by natural reason. It betrayed a great deal of learning and was not ignored by the opposition. Among those whom Ferguson attacked was the Anglican divine William Sherlock who, along with Joseph Glanvill, penned a response, claiming that Ferguson had plagiarized much of his text from various religious authorities. &#145;I can scarce open an English author of any account&#146;, wrote Sherlock, &#145;without making some new discovers of Mr. Ferguson's pilfering humor&#146;  (Sherlock's response in Joseph Glanvill's <span class="italic">An Account of Mr Ferguson's Commonplace Book</span>, 28). But in truth Ferguson had not so much plagiarized as collected and collated various arguments. Ferguson was a quick student and his ability to compile and interweave various lines of argument became the hallmark of his later political writing.<br>
<br>Not satisfied with religious controversy alone, Ferguson became active in London whig politics by the late 1670s. He was initially attached to the household of the prominent merchant Thomas Papillon, to whom he had dedicated <span class="italic">The Interest of Reason in Religion</span>. But by 1679 Ferguson was a &#145;constant consulter and advisor with [the earl of] Shaftesbury&#146;, and his first pieces of propaganda were written in collaboration with Shaftesbury and the earl's circle of friends, supporters, and whig hacks  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 182). Ferguson's early forays into political polemic were Exclusion-era pieces that championed Shaftesbury, supported the duke of Monmouth's ambitions for the throne, and demonized the Catholic duke of York. The central premise of Ferguson's first two tracts, <span class="italic">A Letter to a Person of Honour Concerning the Black Box</span> and <span class="italic">A Letter to a Person of Honour Concerning the King's Disavowing having been Married to the Duke of Monmouth's Mother</span>, both published in 1680, was that the &#145;Protestant duke&#146;, Monmouth, was the true heir to the royal succession, the &#145;black box&#146; reputedly containing proofs of the king's marriage to Lucy Walters, Monmouth's mother. He also accused the &#145;popish successor&#146; of approving &#145;the burning of London and combining with papists in all the part of the late [popish] plot&#146;. These crimes &#145;make him liable to the ax, while his is aspiring to a sceptre&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter to a Person of Honour Concerning the King's Disavowing</span>; reprinted in <span class="italic">Scarce and Valuable Tracts &hellip; Lord Somers</span>, 8.191). During 1681 and 1682, Ferguson published three tracts (entitled <span class="italic">No Protestant Plot</span>, parts 1, 2, and 3) praising Shaftesbury, who &#145;by his courage, wisdom, and intelligence hath both withstood and defeated so many of their [papist] designs against our religion and the safety of the nation&#146;. They also recounted a long history of popish conspiracy and treason and warned Charles II that he was losing his subjects' fidelity by allowing his brother &#145;to rival him in his authority&#146;  (<span class="italic">No Protestant Plot</span>, pt 1, 1681, 8). Although his &#145;black box&#146; and &#145;protestant plot&#146; tracts were published anonymously, Ferguson's authorship was widely suspected. He was vigorously attacked in the royalist press. In satiric verse, pamphlets, and weeklies he was portrayed as a dangerous incendiary. John Dryden immortalized him in <span class="italic">The Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel</span> as Judas, Shaftesbury's paymaster of whig hacks, who &#145;keeps the Rebels Pension-purse&#146;  (Dryden, lines 321&#150;3). Ferguson's most persistent critic was Roger L'Estrange, who used the pages of <span class="italic">The Observator</span> to create a larger-than-life image of Ferguson as the man at the bottom of every seditious libel and every plot, consorting with rebels and fugitives, skulking about back alleys and smoky taverns. According to L'Estrange, Ferguson could turn a &#145;lawful congregation into a common sanctuary for renegades and fugitives&#146;, his nature as well as his principles &#145;fierce, bloody and rebellious&#146;. He was the &#145;son of thunder&#146;, a &#145;Lucifer&#146;, the &#145;mouth of the Party&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observator</span>, no. 398, 5 Sept 1683; no. 396, 1 Sept 1683).<br>
<br>Ferguson earned his sobriquet the Plotter for his part in numerous conspiracies of the 1680s and 1690s, from the summer of 1682 onward, when Shaftesbury and several prominent whig leaders, including William, Lord Russell, Colonel Algernon Sidney, and the duke of Monmouth, began discussing plans to lead a general insurrection against Charles II's government. Ferguson acted as Shaftesbury's envoy between the whig lords and a cabal of conspirators that included lawyers, artisans, and soldiers. Throughout the autumn of 1682 Shaftesbury urged his fellow conspirators to act. In November he learned that the government was preparing new charges against him and he sought refuge in Amsterdam. He took Colonel John Rumsey, Captain Thomas Walcot, and Robert Ferguson with him. Shaftesbury died two months later in the arms of a servant, possibly Ferguson. Back in London the remaining whig conspirators soon realized that it was &#145;impossible for us to act, they [Shaftesbury and Ferguson] having managed the greater part of our city affairs, knew all those considerable gentlemen&#146;. Ferguson was sent for in order to explain Shaftesbury's connections with the City, and with his return the planning of the conspirators resumed  (Ford, Lord Grey, <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Rye House Plot and Monmouth's Rebellion</span>, 1754, 41). At one point the lower cabal of plotters decided to assassinate the king and his brother on their return from Newmarket; they would ambush the royal carriage as it passed Rye House Mill [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93794', "Rye House plotters")</script>]. But the conspirators' plans were exposed to Secretary Jenkins on 12 June and soon became public. Their designs discovered, several conspirators met one last time. The barrister Nathaniel Wade proposed that they immediately lead a rising in the west, but Colonel Rumsey declared that their situation was hopeless. Feeling dejected, they finally decided that each man should &#145;shift for himself&#146;. But Ferguson did not share their fears: he<blockquote>laughed at us all and gave us his parting complement, Gentlemen, you are all strangers to this kind of exercise; I have been used to flight and I will never be out of a plot so long as I live, and yet I hope to meet some of you at Dunbar before Michaelmas. (BL, Add. MS 38847, fol. 119; <span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.409)</blockquote>Ferguson fled to Scotland and eventually took ship to the continent. From Amsterdam he continued to author whig polemic. His elaborate <span class="italic">An Enquiry into and Detection of the Barbarous Murther of the Late Earl of Essex</span> (1684) argued that Essex had not committed suicide in the Tower, where he was awaiting trial for his part in the Rye House plot, but was actually murdered by the duke of York's supporters. <span class="italic">An Enquiry</span> played on popular anti-popery and already widely circulated rumours about the earl's seemingly suspicious death. Ferguson ascribed Essex's murder to part of the ongoing worldwide Catholic conspiracy. Those who had fired London in 1666 now slaughtered the &#145;virtuous&#146;, &#145;heroic and generous&#146; Essex. The &#145;Vatican, Louvre, and St. James [the duke of York's residence]&#146; conspired to ruin Essex because he had sought to expose the Popish Plot, defend the protestant religion and the English people against popery and slavery  (<span class="italic">An Enquiry into and Detection of the Barbarous Murther</span>, 1689 edn, 5&#150;12). Translated into Dutch and Flemish and later republished during the revolution of 1688, Ferguson's <span class="italic">Enquiry</span> was widely read and commented on.<br>
<br>With the death of Charles II and accession of James II, the duke of Monmouth and the earl of Argyll decided to launch joint invasions of England and Scotland from Holland in June 1685. Lord Grey of Warke and Ferguson were Monmouth's principal advisers. Ferguson also drew up the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> that accompanied Monmouth's rebellion and acted as his army chaplain. He landed with Monmouth at Lyme Regis on 11 June. Less than a month later he managed to escape from the battlefield at Sedgemoor and, after hiding in a hayloft for several weeks, sailed safely back to Amsterdam. The capture of Ferguson was the first priority of the English spies in the Netherlands, and he lived in constant fear for his life. He was impoverished, observed in tattered clothes, and rumoured to be starving. Yet by the winter of 1687 he was once again churning out whig propaganda, now championing the cause of the prince of Orange. Ferguson re-entered public debate in reaction to James II's declaration of indulgence. In <span class="italic">A Representation of the Threatening Dangers Impending over Protestants in Great Britain</span>, published in both English and Dutch, Ferguson strove to warn nonconformists of the dangers belying James's promise of liberty of conscience. Although the king &#145;may hug and carressth&#146; dissenters now, his true intention was to re-establish popery  (<span class="italic">A Representation of the Threatening Dangers</span>, 1687, 9). Ferguson also reasserted his claim that the earl of Essex had been murdered in the Tower. When asked by the sea captain who transported copies of <span class="italic">A Representation of the Threatening Dangers</span> from Holland to England if he had proof that Essex was murdered, Ferguson supposedly replied: &#145;Captain, take no thought of that, it doth not concern you or me whether it be true or false. The report is spread and it will have all the effects as true and so serve our end&#146;  (N. Salmon, <span class="italic">Lives of the English Bishops</span>, 1733, 212). Ferguson's next tract, <span class="italic">Reflexions on Monsieur Fagel's Letter</span>, was written as a companion piece to a tract by Gaspar Fagel, pensionary of Holland, who published a description and defence of the prince and princess of Orange's negative response to the declaration of indulgence. Ferguson's <span class="italic">Reflexions</span> was again addressed to dissenters who were tempted to support James's indulgence. If they supported him, he warned, the Church of England would be lost and, in the end, they would have traded their civil liberties away for &#145;a precarious, pretended liberty of conscience&#146;  (ibid., 4).<br>
<br>In October 1688 Ferguson's assistance may have been enlisted by the prince of Orange's advisers as they prepared William's English and Scottish declarations. Meanwhile propaganda in England promoted the idea that William's cause was supported by &#145;some loyal Rye-House and Sedgemoor men, true disciples of honest old [Richard] Rumbold and Robin Ferguson&#146;  (Ferguson, 257&#150;8). Ferguson sailed to Torbay with the prince and his army and on 10 November he kicked down a church door and with sword in hand proclaiming &#145;cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood&#146;  (Morrice, 2.320). After the flight of James, Ferguson published <span class="italic">A Brief Justification of the Prince of Orange's Descent</span>, one of the most influential tracts of the revolution of 1688. It promoted and defended William's claim to the throne and gave the Convention Parliament, which met in January 1689 to solve the current crisis, an interpretative framework in which to place, discuss, and explain the final months of 1688. <span class="italic">A Brief Justification</span> set forth a contractarian theory of government which, Ferguson claimed, was the basis of England's ancient constitution. All legal governments have their origins in such &#145;compacts, stipulations, compromises, and agreements&#146;  (R. Ferguson, <span class="italic">A Brief Justification</span>, 8). He went on to defend the right of popular resistance. James II had subverted the constitution and invaded the people's rights and liberties; he had &#145;unqualified himself&#146; from his position as king. It was the duty of every protestant and Englishman to take up arms against him. Yet, in the end, force had not been necessary. James II himself had &#145;abdicated&#146; his throne by &#145;retiring beyond sea&#146;  (ibid., 19, 22). Ferguson concluded by recommending that parliament endow the prince of Orange with &#145;sovereign and legal power&#146;, while allowing his wife, the princess of Orange, to be &#145;named with him in all laws, gifts, grants, and patents&#146;. By choosing William, the &#145;nation hath in its whole political body exercised the power belonging unto it&#146; and restored &#145;the government upon its primitive and original foundation&#146;  (ibid., 34&#150;5, 37). <span class="italic">A Brief Justification</span> was a significant contribution to the literature of the revolution. It justified the use of force and asserted the concept of devolution of power to the people. Still many of its ideas were consistent with the thinking of the Convention Parliament, which also posited the idea that James had simply &#145;vacated&#146; the throne and thus abdicated his position. They also adopted the formula that placed both William and Mary on the throne while investing administrative power in William alone. &#145;That which remains to be done&#146;, Ferguson states, bringing his arguments to a close, &#145;is to declare the Prince of Orange King &hellip; His unchangeable adherence to what he promised in his Declaration, as a Prince, shews with what sacredness, he will observe his Oath as King&#146;  (ibid., 36).<br>
<br>Ferguson soon thought himself mistaken, as William III did not uphold his declaration to the satisfaction of many radical whigs. Within eighteen months of William's invasion Ferguson began criticizing the new regime and was suspected of plotting with Jacobites. Ferguson's support during the revolution had been rewarded by William, who appointed him housekeeper of the excise office. Ferguson might na&iuml;vely have hoped for a bishopric; but a more likely explanation for his opposition is that he was truly disillusioned with the new regime, coupled with his restless desire for conspiracy and intrigue.<br>
<br>As a Scot and an extraordinarily able polemicist, Ferguson was approached by Sir James Montgomery to represent Scottish grievances in the summer of 1689. The result was Ferguson's first critique of William's administration, <span class="italic">The Late Proceedings and Votes of the Parliament of Scotland</span>, published in that year. Ferguson makes it clear that he still supports the king, but he wonders at William's unwillingness to oblige the Scottish parliament in all their demands. Ferguson squarely lays the blame on William's reliance on James II's former tools, who slander good men by calling them republicans. The king had nothing to fear from republican principles, so long as he preserved his people's &#145;rights and liberties, esteem parliaments, and make the known laws the measure and standard of your government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Late Proceedings</span>, 7).<br>
<br>Over the next several months Ferguson continued to scheme with the discontented. He also converted to the Church of England. In 1690 he was arrested along with Sir John Cochrane on suspicion of treasonable practices, but released for lack of evidence. Two years later he landed in Newgate again for suspicious activity and was dismissed from his position at the excise. These short imprisonments only seem to have emboldened him and pushed him further into the arms of St Germain. In February 1691 Ferguson received a full pardon for his past deeds from James II.<br>
<br>In 1694 Ferguson began publishing at breakneck pace. His two tracts of that year, <span class="italic">A Letter to Mr Secretary Trenchard</span> and <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Honourable Sir John Holt, Kt, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench</span>, which were written in connection with the Lancashire plot, did not directly place the blame on William for the injustices done to harassed Jacobites and nonjurors, but rather on the king's corrupt whig ministers. Ferguson portrayed the Jacobites as still committed to the principles of passive obedience. They had not renounced, Ferguson asserted with great irony, &#145;all the religious as well as political principles with which your Tillotsons, Burnets, Sherlocks etc imbu'd them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to &hellip; Holt</span>, 12). Of course this was clearly a lie, if cleverly contrived. Ferguson's tracts underscored his commitment to the &#145;Ancient English constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to &hellip; Trenchard</span>, 26), which he saw as under siege by the illegal atrocities of William's administration.<br>
<br>In the following year Ferguson issued three more tracts in which any lingering hope that the current regime would reform itself had evaporated. His virulent <span class="italic">A Brief Account of Some of the Late Encroachments and Depredations of the Dutch upon the English</span> accused the Dutch of attempting to &#145;enslave and impoverish&#146; the English. William had not only &#145;rapaciously seized&#146; the crown, but set about introducing &#145;atheism, thralldom, and poverty&#146;  (pp. 2, 8, 27). <span class="italic">A Brief Account</span> has been called &#145;one of the most skillful pieces of Jacobite propaganda&#146;  (Cruickshanks, 7) and particularly angered William III and his ministers. In addition, Ferguson's two companion pieces of 1695, <span class="italic">Whether Parliament be not in Law Dissolved by the Death of the Princess of Orange</span> and <span class="italic">Whether the Preserving of the Protestant Religion was the Motive &hellip; that was Designed in the Late Revolution</span>, both attacked the king and his administration from a constitutionalist position. In many respects he made the same arguments as in his whig days:<blockquote>our whole government was founded upon the supposal and concession, that it was to be a government of and over freemen &hellip; And the Great Charter, and other Laws &hellip; did not create and give us a Right to the Freedom of our Persons; but they did only assert, vindicate, and fence it about. They were not laws of manumission from Bondage, but declaratory of our antecedent and inherent title to liberty. (<span class="italic">Whether Parliament be not in Law Dissolved</span>, 14)</blockquote>He did, however, renounce his former position that resistance to James II in 1688 was justified. <i>Salus populi</i> was still the supreme law, but the ancient constitution never contained any &#145;stipulatory agreement by which it is provided that if princes do not as they should, they do either forfeit their sovereign authority or that we may lawfully rebel against and dethrone them&#146;  (ibid., 17&#150;18).<br>
<br>While the use of force may not have been permitted within the framework of the original contract between the people and the sovereign, the ancient English constitution had been completely subverted by the convention in 1689. &#145;Whatever there was of an <i>Original Contract</i> between former Kings and the free People of these Kingdoms, yet it is undeniable, there is a very <i>formal</i> and <i>explicit One</i> between K. <i>William</i> and them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to &hellip; Trenchard</span>, 3). This formal contract established the prince of Orange as a <i>de facto</i> king only. His rule had become tyrannical and thus force was necessary to oppose force, to defend British lives and liberties, and the laws established; thus the Jacobite cause was utterly justified. Ferguson never resorted to tory arguments of divine right, Filmerian patriarchalism, or the right of conquest. He used instead the constitutionalist arguments he had forwarded as a whig, which were similar to those put forward by such other whiggish Jacobites as Sir James Montgomery and Charlwood Lawton.<br>
<br>Ferguson probably participated in the Jacobite schemes of Sir George Barclay and was arrested in connection with the Barclay plot in March 1696 and not released until January of the following year. By the late 1690s Ferguson seems to have become increasingly involved with Robert Harley and the country opposition. During Anne's reign it was rumoured that Ferguson had converted to Catholicism. Burnet claimed that Ferguson pretended to be &#145;high church, but many believed him a papist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 5.126). Similarly an informant for Anne's government reported that Ferguson, who was known as Uncle among the Jacobites, was feigning to be a protestant, when in fact he was an &#145;old Roman agent wrapt up in a Geneva Charter&#146;  (M. Smith, <span class="italic">Private Memoirs</span>, 1718, 3). None the less, Ferguson usually aligned himself with protestant Jacobites and churned out violent anti-Catholic polemic. Just as Ferguson's whig tracts were replete with tales of Catholic barbarism and protestant sacrifice, so Ferguson as a Jacobite could not restrain himself from more lurid tales of worldwide Catholic conspiracy, despite his support of James II and his son. Ferguson began developing his story of the revolution as part of the Catholic plotting in 1695 and brought it to fruition in 1706 with his <span class="italic">History of the Revolution</span>, where he argued that it was &#145;neither K. James's intent to destroy nor the Prince of Orange's to protect the Protestant religion&#146;. Because James II would not support the supremacy of the pope over England, Rome &#145;pitched&#146;  (p. 5) upon the ambitious prince of Orange to invade England, divide the Church of England, and make war on France to bring an end to the &#145;Gallican&#146; church's ancient liberties  (p. 10). Prince William was more than happy to comply and was reconciled to Rome. Though the anti-Catholic rhetoric was nothing new for Ferguson, he also added a virulent anti-sectarianism along with a new devotion to the Church of England, Charles I, and the entire Stuart dynasty (with the exception of Mary II). In this respect he sounded like other high church propagandists, including Mary Astell, and Jacobites like Charles Leslie. His <span class="italic">An Account of the Obligations the States of Holland have to Great Britain</span> (1711) vehemently attacked whigs, mercantile interests, the Dutch and all foreigners, and especially the war and those like the duke and duchess of Marlborough who profited from it. Ferguson was also in communication with Robert Harley's government and went from judiciously leaking the names of his Jacobite friends to betraying them outright, hoping to be rewarded for his services. Most likely, Ferguson was telling tales to both sides, as he had as an informant in the 1660s.<br>
<br>Ferguson was probably a double agent for most of his career; but he was an exceptional propagandist and whigs, Jacobites, and country tories benefited from his extraordinarily capable pen. In 1713 Robert Wodrow wrote that Ferguson &#145;is yet alive, in great want, and upwards of ninety years, and hath nothing but what he begs&#146;  (Wodrow, 2.270&#150;71). Despite his long career of intrigue, sedition, and espionage, he died in his bed in 1714. Ferguson had a wife, Hannah (formerly Brindley), and two children, one of whom was reported to be a priest in Genoa  (<span class="italic">Private Memoirs</span>, 12). A physical description of Ferguson is given in the proclamation for apprehending him in 1683: &#145;a tall lean man, dark-brown hair, a great Roman nose, thin-jawed, heat in his face, speaks in a Scotch tone, a sharp piercing eye, stoops a little in the shoulders. He has a shuffling gate that differs from all men; wears his periwig down almost over his eyes&#146;  (Ferguson, 115).<br>
