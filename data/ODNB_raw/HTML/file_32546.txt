<span class="headword">Cooper, Sir  Alfred</span>  (1838&#150;1908), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born at Norwich on 28 December 1838, was the son of William Cooper, at one time recorder of Ipswich, and his wife, Anna Marsh. In April 1850 Cooper entered Merchant Taylors' School, then in Suffolk Lane, London. He was later apprenticed to W. Peter Nichols, surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and sometime mayor of Norwich. In 1858 Cooper became a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He gained his MRCS on 29 June 1861, and in the same year he passed the licence of the Society of Apothecaries. These two qualifications formed the usual route to practice at this time. He then went to Paris with Thomas Smith (1833&#150;1909), to improve his anatomical knowledge. He was appointed a prosector to the examiners at the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Cooper started practice in Jermyn Street, London, eventually establishing a fashionable private practice. He remained an enthusiastic operator, serving several voluntary hospitals. He was surgeon to St Mark's Hospital for Fistula, City Road, from April 1864 until 1897, to the West London Hospital from 1867 to 1884, to the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, City Road, and to the Lock Hospital, Soho. At this hospital he gained a broad knowledge of syphilis. On 4 July 1882 he married Lady Agnes Cecil Emmeline Duff (<i>d</i>. 1925), third daughter of James, fifth earl of Fife, and sister of Alexander, the first duke of Fife; Lady Agnes had been married first to Viscount Dupplin (they divorced in 1876), and secondly to Herbert Flower (<i>d</i>. 1880); Cooper and Lady Agnes had three daughters and a son, the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32547/', "(Alfred) Duff Cooper (1890&#150;1954)")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1884 Cooper published <span class="italic">Syphilis and Pseudosyphilis</span>, which was revised in a second edition in 1895. He also wrote <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Disease of the Rectum</span> (1887), which he revised with F. Swinford Edwards as <span class="italic">Diseases of the Rectum and Anus</span> (1892). Cooper was admitted FRCS Edinburgh in 1868, and FRCS England on 9 June 1870. He became a close friend of William Alexander, twelfth duke of Hamilton, and the duke presented him with Cooper Angus Lodge, Whiting Bay, in the Isle of Arran, which he made his home when he retired from London.<br>
<br>In 1874 Cooper travelled to St Petersburg with the prince of Wales, later Edward VII, on the marriage of Alfred Ernest Albert, duke of Edinburgh. In recognition of his services he was appointed by the tsar a chevalier of the order of St Stanislas. In 1893 he was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the duke of Edinburgh when he became duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Cooper was knighted at Edward VII's coronation in 1902.<br>
<br>Cooper gained a wide knowledge of the world, partly as surgeon to kings and princes, partly in the out-patient rooms of hospitals, and partly through his expertise in syphilis. He was highly regarded by the profession and was trusted as a broadminded confidant by his patients. He was elected twice to the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, serving from 1895 to 1905. On one occasion his name was at the top of the poll, and he was consequently co-opted as vice-president.<br>
<br>From early in his career Cooper served as surgeon to the Inns of Court rifle volunteers, &#145;The devil's own&#146;, and he retained a deep interest in the reserve forces throughout his life. He obtained the volunteer decoration for long service and eventually served as surgeon-colonel to the Duke of York's Loyal Suffolk hussars. Cooper was also an active freemason. He held high office in the United Grand Lodge of England and was instrumental in founding the Rahere Lodge, which was the first masonic body to be associated with a hospital.<br>
<br>Cooper died at Villa St Jacques, Menton, France, on 3 March 1908, and was buried in the English cemetery there. He was survived by his wife.<br>
