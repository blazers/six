<span class="headword">Ogilvy <span class="st"> [Ogilvie]</span>, Sir  Patrick, of Boyne</span>, Lord Boyne  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1705), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest of three sons and three daughters of Sir Walter Ogilvie (<i>c</i>.1621&#150;1666/7), sixth laird of Boyne, Banffshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inchmartin. In 1660 his father settled the barony and thanedom of Boyne on him. Ogilvy's first marriage, to Anna, eldest daughter of James, laird of Grant, produced a son, James (<i>b</i>. 1667). James became an active Jacobite who in 1707 fled to France, where he settled. Anna died in April 1667, and about 1679 Ogilvy married Anna, daughter of Douglas of Wittingham and widow of Patrick Barclay of Towie; a son, Archibald, was born in 1680.<br>
<br>On the death of his father Ogilvy had inherited a large estate, extending from Portsoy to Banff, with its principal seat at Boyne Castle. He developed the harbour of Portsoy, and the nearby marble quarries which produced a stone which was popular in Britain and was also exported. His long study of the law, coupled to influence, marked him out for political advancement and he represented Banff in the Scottish parliament of 1669&#150;74 and thereafter for some twenty-four years, until 1693 when his seat was declared vacant because he had not signed the assurance. On 14 October 1681 he was named a judge of the court of session, with the title Lord Boyne, and at the same time received the honour of knighthood. In addition he undertook military duties, both as a volunteer and in the regular forces, holding commissions in various militia regiments.<br>
<br>Boyne ran into opposition when in 1684 he was recorded as having purchased a suit of English cloth, which incensed local manufacturers at Newmills who lodged a particular complaint against Andrew Irving, the Edinburgh merchant who had sold him the imported garments. An outspoken Jacobite, Boyne was one of those who in 1681 signed a declaration that it was unlawful to take up arms against the king. In January 1686 he received a pension from James II, for what reason it is not clear, but as he had in 1677 received a royal protection against paying annual rents on his mortgages, he was possibly already falling into financial difficulties and as a good Jacobite was considered worthy of support.<br>
<br>Boyne's third marriage, in December 1682, was to Lady Anne, youngest daughter of Hugh Montgomerie, seventh earl of Eglinton, and widow of Sir Andrew Ramsay, bt. She seems to have been the cause of a public dispute in March 1686 between Boyne and the younger Campbell of Calder, by which time there was a rift between the couple and Anne was pregnant with a child whose paternity was disputed. Boyne was returning from court when Campbell confronted him in the High Street, Edinburgh, spat in his face, called him a rascal and a villain, and offered to strike him, saying that if Lord Boyne had been carrying a sword he would have run him through. The court of session committed Campbell to prison in the Tolbooth, and laid the matter before the king, who directed that Campbell should ask pardon of the king and the court, and, on his knees, of Lord Boyne, which he did on 14 September, gaining his release. Anne had departed by the time that the child was born in November 1686. It is not known if she was ever reconciled with her husband, nor what became of the child.<br>
<br>On the accession of Queen Anne, Boyne was sent as an emissary of the Jacobites to propose to her, &#145;the design of bringing the Pretender to succeed to the crown upon a bargain that she should hold it during her life&#146;, and that on his return &#145;he gave the party full assurance that she had accepted it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 5.455). He was mentioned in 1705 in the duke of Perth's instructions as one of those who had distinguished themselves by their loyalty to the exiled Stuart cause since the revolution of 1688. The date and circumstances of his death are not known.<br>
