<span class="headword">Blackie,  John</span>  (1782&#150;1874), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born at Old Wynd, Glasgow, on 27 October 1782, the first child of John Blackie (<i>b</i>. 1762), tobacco spinner of Glasgow, and Agnes Burrell (<i>b</i>. 1760), who had married in 1781. Childhood memory survives only in Blackie's own words that he was &#145;very little at school after six years of age&#146;. As American independence reduced the Glasgow-dominated European tobacco trade, Blackie was apprenticed, aged eleven, to a master weaver. At eighteen he was a journeyman with another, John Duncan.<br>
<br>On 31 December 1804 Blackie married Duncan's daughter, Catharine (1777&#150;1847). Nelson's victory at Trafalgar dispelled fear of Napoleonic invasion, but development of power-looms brought new worries. In 1805 a son was born and Blackie abandoned weaving to join W. D. and A. Brownlie, publishers. For them he sold books in cheap monthly parts, as a colporteur.<br>
<br>Unexpectedly, retiring in 1807, the Brownlies offered their business to Blackie. Acceptance became possible through the generosity of Walter Graham, a Glasgow merchant. Mrs Graham had befriended Blackie before his marriage, and her husband stood as guarantor for payment. The friendship prospered, and later, in 1816, a second (surviving) son was baptized Walter Graham Blackie.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Blackie entered partnership in 1809 with William Sommerville and Archibald Fullarton, former Brownlies employees, later joined by another, Edward Khull, a printer. In 1816 they erected a five-storey building in the city: ground-floor printing works, with bindery, warehouse, and offices above. Operations were divided in 1819 between Glasgow and Edinburgh; subsequently numerous reorganizations took place. Sommerville left in 1821: Khull became independent but still printed for Blackie. John Blackie junior became publishing partner in Blackie &amp; Son, Glasgow: young Walter was learning printing under Khull. In 1826 Khull finally left, and in 1829 Blackie bought the valuable business at Villafield of Andrew and J. M. Duncan, university printers and successors to the Foulis brothers, famous throughout Europe in the eighteenth century. His younger son, only twenty-one, with stout parental confidence, led a new firm, W. G. Blackie &amp; Co., printers, Villafield.<br>
<br>Although the original partners had disagreed, Sommerville and Blackie always intended to publish books. Before Sommerville left, a substantial list included religious, historical, and travel works; literature, notably Richardson's four-volume <span class="italic">Pamela</span>; and yet another to join the myriad editions of Burns's <span class="italic">Poems</span>. By 1842 all three of Blackie's sons were partners. Throughout the changes Blackie himself controlled finance, and his remarkable skills never failed, despite his lack of schooling.<br>
<br>Those skills went beyond financial management. Blackie travelled throughout Britain, later crossing the Atlantic, visiting paper, cloth, and board mills; renewing plant and stocks. He assessed manuscripts with technical comprehension; appointed marketing and distribution agents; supervised quality control in factory and offices. Blackie never relaxed from self-imposed responsibilities, driven sometimes by determination to banish sadness. A devout man, concerned in matters of the established church, and later the Free Church, he was greatly disturbed by the Disruption of 1843, and in 1847 by the death of his first wife.<br>
<br>Blackie's private time and money were much devoted to ailing relations; he invested shrewdly in property and the stock market, becoming, in 1850, a director of the Clydesdale Bank. On 4 November of that year he married Margaret Ferguson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frame, a widow. She survived him. A natural manager, Blackie worried over working conditions and the welfare and health of his employees. He eschewed popularity. His understanding of difficulties in the lives of others had grown out of the humble beginning and order of his own: his employees developed reciprocal understanding, and devotion to him.<br>
<br>Blackie died at his home, 20 Kew Terrace, Glasgow, on 16 June 1874. The business he founded was carried on successfully by his son Walter Graham Blackie, who was eventually succeeded by <i>his</i> son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61602/', "John Alexander Blackie (1850&#150;1918)")</script>; it developed for generations as Blackie &amp; Son. It became renowned among the great Scottish printers and publishers for nearly 200 years. Another grandson, Walter W. Blackie, wrote of him with affectionate pride, and of &#145;the impression that he was rather an exceptional man, a blend of a Saint, a Superman, and a Right-Good-Sort&#146;  (W. W. Blackie, <span class="italic">John Blackie, Senior</span>, 74).<br>
