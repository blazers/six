<span class="headword">Bothwell,  Adam</span>  (1529?&#150;1593), <span class="occ">bishop of Orkney</span>, was the son of Francis Bothwell (<i>d</i>. 1535) and his second wife, Katherine Bellenden. He came of an important Edinburgh family with many links to the king's government. His paternal grandfather, William, was a town burgess and dean of guild. His father was provost of Edinburgh in 1523&#150;4, a lord of council and session from 1532, and often a lord of the articles. His uncle Richard Bothwell (<i>d</i>. 1549) became provost of St Mary-of-the-Fields, Edinburgh, in 1524, and in the same year was appointed director of the royal chancery. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Bellenden of Auchinoull, was made director of chancery in 1538 and justice-clerk a year later. His mother later married Oliver Sinclair, a favourite of James V and the likely commander of the Scottish army defeated at Solway Moss in 1542. His half-sister Janet, the daughter of his father's first marriage to Janet Richardson, married Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston, who became general of the mint; the mathematician John Napier was their son.<br>
<br>Nothing is recorded of Adam Bothwell's early life, but he was certainly a university graduate. His father had studied at the University of Orl&eacute;ans and Bothwell may have done the same. It is probably significant that in 1560 he urged his brother-in-law to send the young John Napier &#145;to the schuyllis: over to France or to Flanderis, for he can leyr na guid at home&#146;  (Keller, 115). Nor is it known when he took orders. In 1552 his half-brother William Napier died as parson of Ashkirk, a prebend of Glasgow Cathedral, and shortly afterwards Bothwell succeeded him in this valuable benefice. He also inherited property in the outskirts of Edinburgh at Corstorphine (where he became vicar), Briglands, and Henderstoun, and at Dunsyre, Lanarkshire. In 1555 he went on government business to Orkney, an appointment he could have owed either to his brother-in-law Gilbert Balfour of Westray, the husband of his second sister, Margaret, or to his stepfather, Oliver Sinclair, a near relation of the earls of Caithness. Bothwell's links with the northern isles became much closer four years later, following the death of Robert Reid, bishop of Orkney, on 6 September 1558. After the temporality of the see had been granted to his cousin Sir John Bellenden, Bothwell was himself nominated bishop on 24 July 1559 and provided on 2 August following, the necessary bulls having been secured at Rome and brought home by Balfour. He had most likely been consecrated by 14 October, when he was admitted to the temporality. He was probably then thirty years old.<br>
<br>Bothwell set out for his diocese in February 1560, but was captured by an English ship and held prisoner for several weeks. He arrived in Orkney only in April, to face problems of all kinds: his health was often poor; a large proportion of his revenues had been disposed of in pensions by his predecessor; and his appearance in his diocese was far from welcome to some important members of his flock, notably Henry and Robert Sinclair, who took possession of the episcopal residence at Birsay and, according to Bothwell himself, set upon him as he returned from a visitation, intending &#145;to haiff alder slaine me, or taiken me&#146;  (Donaldson, 27). But Bothwell was not discouraged. From the first he showed himself a committed proponent of the reformed religion and its establishment in his diocese. Later he described how, &#145;when idolatry and superstitione was suppressed&#146;, he curbed &#145;the same also in his bounds, preached the word, administered the sacraments, planted ministers in Orknay and Shetland, disponed benefices and gave out stipends out of his rents to ministers, exhorters and readers&#146;  (Kirk, <span class="italic">Patterns of Reform</span>, 215).<br>
<br>During 1560 and 1561 Bothwell established the foundations for reform primarily through his cathedral's dignitaries, whom he appointed to the parishes from which their revenues derived. He also imported men sympathetic to the cause of reform. Prominent among them were Gilbert Foulsie, a former monk who had become Bothwell's secretary before being made archdeacon of Orkney; the bishop's cousin Francis Bothwell, who had been a friar and now became treasurer of Kirkwall Cathedral; and William Lauder, a Glasgow notary who succeeded Foulsie as the bishop's secretary. In Shetland Bothwell appointed Archdeacon Jerome Cheyne, who had served Bishop Reid, to act as &#145;minister in these parts&#146;  (Kirk, <span class="italic">Patterns of Reform</span>, 29), and by 1562 two other priests were acting as readers there. An appeal to the assembly in 1563 shows that elders and deacons had by then been installed in Orkney. The impetus was maintained and the parishes were quickly staffed by reformed clergy, so that by 1567 there were more than thirty ministers or readers in Orkney and Shetland, with almost every parish being served.<br>
<br>Bothwell helped the reformed church to achieve stability in Orkney by quickly making arrangements for paying ministers' stipends. However, while this proved acceptable to the general assembly, his own finances were a continual cause of trouble. At odds with a series of chamberlains, by the time of his death Bothwell claimed to be owed 10,000 merks by the heir of one of them. Nevertheless, he seems to have been resident in his diocese for at least a part of every year in the early 1560s, and between June 1563 and December 1566 he also attended most of the general assemblies. In December 1563 he became a member of the committee set up to revise the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, and he was appointed to committees in 1565 and 1566. In keeping with the approved practice of the reformed church he married; he and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1608), daughter of John Murray of Touchadam, had six sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1564 Bothwell was increasingly involved in secular affairs, in ways which eventually brought him into conflict with the kirk. On 14 January he was admitted an extraordinary lord of the court of session and on 13 November 1565 an ordinary lord, and he also became a member of the privy council. It was not these promotions as such which first brought trouble upon him, but his marrying Queen Mary to the fourth earl of Bothwell, on 15 May 1567. At first, indeed, the bishop seems to have escaped censure&#151;the order of the reformed kirk had been used, and he was still able to take part in the coronation of James VI on 29 July following, when he anointed the infant king on the head, shoulder blades, and hands. Earlier that day he had been one of those who received Queen Mary's demission of the crown, and shortly afterwards he took part in the expedition, led by his cousin William Kirkcaldy of Grange, which set off for the northern isles in pursuit of the queen's husband, recently created duke of Orkney. The ship ran upon a rock in Bressay Sound in East Shetland, and the bishop saved his life only by a desperate leap, in full armour, from the wreck into a crowded lifeboat.<br>
<br>Adam Bothwell was not rewarded as he might have expected for his apparent willingness to risk his life in the young king's cause. Instead he seems to have fallen victim to the insecurities of Regent Moray's government, exacerbated by the ambitions of Lord Robert Stewart for control of Orkney (of which he later became earl, in 1581), and perhaps also by the kirk's growing misgivings concerning bishops. In December 1567 several accusations were made against him in the general assembly: he had been lax in visitation; his employment as a lord of session had distracted him from his ecclesiastical ministry; he had associated with Francis Bothwell, allegedly a papist; and he had solemnized the queen's marriage to the earl of Bothwell, contrary to an act of assembly prohibiting the marriage of a divorced adulterer. The bishop admitted that he could not reside continuously in his diocese, &#145;by reason of the evil air and the weakness of his body&#146;  (Kirk, <span class="italic">Patterns of Reform</span>, 40), but though he made a spirited defence against the other charges he was none the less suspended from all function in the ministry. In July 1568 he was reinstated on condition that he publicly confessed his fault concerning the queen's marriage, but the episode had weakened his position, and, late in September, under heavy pressure from Lord Robert Stewart, Bothwell conveyed to the latter all the lands, rights, and revenues of his see in exchange for the commendatorship of Holyrood Abbey. He remained bishop but was never again appointed by the assembly to oversee his diocese, and he was superseded in his functions by local ministers acting as commissioners.<br>
<br>His bargain with Stewart and his failure thereafter to act as bishop led to further charges being brought against Bothwell in the assembly of March 1570. His exchange of episcopal office for monastic lands was denounced as simoniacal, and he was also criticized for neglecting his diocese, for acting as a lord of session, for failing to preach, and for retaining the title of bishop, especially as he took &#145;Roman titles as Reverend Father in God which pertaineth to no Ministers of Christ Jesus, nor is given them in Scriptures&#146;. On this last point Bothwell abased himself, admitting that he was just &#145;a worm of the earth not worthy any reverence&#146;  (Kirk, <span class="italic">Second Book of Discipline</span>, 78). But he defended himself against the other charges, in terms which suggest that he felt he was unjustly used, especially concerning his acting as a lord of session, a position he had accepted:<blockquote>with the advice of godly and learned men, compting it not repugnant or contrariouse to any good order as yet established in the Kirke, and alledged that diverse others having benefices, have done the like, and are not condemned for so doing. (Mullan, 31)</blockquote>The immediate outcome of the assembly's censures is unknown, but thereafter Bothwell had no contact with his diocese besides receiving a few presentations to churches. Nevertheless, he retained his episcopal title and in 1580 was one of the bishops whom the general assembly demanded should submit to its authority.<br>
<br>Instead Bothwell lived in Edinburgh and acted as a government servant, as, indeed, he had long done. A member of the commission which in 1568&#150;9 had brought accusations against Queen Mary in England, in January 1572 he was one of the government's representatives which negotiated the concordat of Leith, regularizing the organization and finances of the kirk. Later that year he represented the king's party in its attempts to make peace with the queen's followers. In 1578 he appears to have supported the earls of Atholl and Argyll against the former regent, Morton. He was a regular attender of privy council meetings from the early 1570s onwards, and was also active as a lord of session. He was present at almost every parliament until his death. When King James returned from Scandinavia in 1590, Bothwell was consulted about the arrangements for Anne of Denmark's coronation, on the basis of his involvement in James's in 1567. He had two residences in Edinburgh, the &#145;commendator's house&#146; on the north side of Holyrood Palace, and a house in Byres' Close, very near the tolbooth, where the court of session sat.<br>
<br>It is not known where Bothwell kept his library, which its surviving inventory shows to have been impressively large and wide-ranging. He clearly started buying books in his student days, and acquired works by many classical and patristic authors. He added to his collection at least into the 1580s, for instance in the field of theology, when the writings of Beza joined those of earlier Reformation luminaries such as Calvin, Melancthon, and Bullinger. His purchases indicate that he could read Latin, Hebrew, Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish. His judicial employment, as well as his work as a bishop, probably accounts for his owning large numbers of books on canon and civil law, while his continued ill health (in 1582 he excused himself from obeying the kirk's order to take on a congregational ministry on the grounds of sickness) may explain his many books on medicine and surgery. A typical representative of the Scottish Renaissance, if an unusually widely read one, he was interested in political theory, owning books by Buchanan and Bodin, possessed several works of history, and also concerned himself with such subjects as mathematics, geography, philosophy, astronomy, witchcraft, and cookery. Perhaps it was because he lived so close to the royal court that he had a copy of Castiglione's <span class="italic">The Courtier</span>.<br>
<br>Although financial aspects of his episcopate periodically resurfaced to trouble his peace, as did his deal with Robert Stewart, Bothwell is not known to have visited Orkney again after 1567. He died in Edinburgh on 23 August 1593 and was buried in Holyrood Abbey church. He had resigned as a lord of session a few weeks earlier, on 2 July, when he was succeeded by his eldest son, John, who in 1595 returned to the king &#145;ane great rubie set in golde&#146; which James had pawned to the bishop for &pound;500 Scots  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 4.432). A courtier and a privy councillor, John Bothwell was created Lord Holyroodhouse on 20 December 1607, and died on 26 November 1609.<br>
