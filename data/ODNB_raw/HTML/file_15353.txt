<span class="headword">Kendrick,  Emma Eleonora</span>  (1788&#150;1871), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was baptized on 22 February 1789 at St Mary Street, St Marylebone Road, Middlesex, the daughter of Joseph Kendrick (<i>b</i>. 1755), sculptor, and his wife, Jane. Her elder brother, Josephus Kendrick (1791&#150;1832), was also a sculptor; in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> his identity was confused with that of his father. Josephus Kendrick entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1808, where in 1813 he obtained a gold medal. He exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy and designed two monumental tablets in St Paul's Cathedral. He was described by Gunnis as &#145;a competent minor sculptor&#146;  (Gunnis, 226).<br>
<br>Emma Kendrick became very successful as a miniature painter in watercolour on ivory and obtained a large practice. She later noted that &#145;Mr. West, the late president of the Royal Academy, said to me when a beginner &#147;Go on and prosper; you are in the right road&#148;&#146;  (Kendrick, 111). In 1810&#150;11 she was awarded by the Society of Artists a silver palette for a drawing after Giorgione; in 1812 a silver medal for a miniature copy, after Guercino; and in 1814 the Gold Isis medal for an original figurative miniature, <span class="italic">Religion</span>. This medal she was again awarded in 1816 for an original miniature of Dido, and in 1817 for an original historical miniature. She exhibited at the Royal Academy, from 1811 to 1840, a total of eighty-three miniatures, including <i>ad vivum</i> portraits and copies after works by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Van Dyck, and a similar number at the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street. From 1815 to 1820 she also exhibited with the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Her portraits in miniature include a three-quarter-length portrait of Lady Caroline Lamb in a white dress and cashmere shawl, holding an open book (exh. RA, 1817; V&amp;A), which is signed on the reverse and also there inscribed by the artist with her address, &#145;6 Upper Marylebone Street / Fitzroy Square&#146;. In keeping with the sitter's pensive expression this miniature is more softly and delicately painted than her hard-edged miniature of Mrs Vanhardt in masquerade dress, signed and dated 1828, also in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Basil Long noted that she &#145;varied her style a good deal&#146;  (Long, 249).<br>
<br>Following the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of her affair of the previous year with the poet Lord Byron, in January 1814 Lady Caroline Lamb stole a miniature of Byron (priv. coll.), painted by George Sanders (<i>c</i>.1812), from the house of the publisher John Murray. Through the intervention of her aunt Lady Melbourne the miniature was eventually returned to Byron, but not before Lady Caroline succeeded in obtaining a secret copy of it, taken by Miss Kendrick, which Lady Caroline enclosed in a large gold locket inscribed with the words &#145;Ne Crede Byron&#146;. This locket, which still contains the miniature of Byron painted by Miss Kendrick, is now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Her miniature of General Matvey Ivanovich Platov, one of the commanding officers of the Russian allies against Napoleon, was sold at Christies (18 December 1974, lot 70). Miss Kendrick painted miniatures of several British officers, including William Carr Beresford, Viscount Beresford, and Sir George Walker. Her portrait of Thomas Erskine, first Baron Erskine of Restormel, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1816. In her rectangular miniature of an unknown man (priv. coll., France), inscribed &#145;Emma Eleonora Kendrick / Pinxit 1825. / 4 Duchess Street / <i>Portland Place</i>&#146;, Long saw &#145;the influence of Sir Thomas Lawrence&#146;; &#145;the features were softly but accurately modelled&#146;; this miniature he considered &#145;distinctly good&#146;  (Long, 250). Many of her miniatures were engraved, including those of Lady Forester, Lady Kirkwall, and Lady Grantham. Miss Kendrick described herself in 1818 as miniature painter to Princess Elizabeth, Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg; in 1831 she was appointed miniature painter to William IV.<br>
<br>Miss Kendrick published in 1830 <span class="italic">Conversations on the Art of Miniature Painting</span>, in which she describes, in five conversations, her materials and technique. In her advice to Miss Forester, daughter of the duchess of Rutland, to whom she dedicated this work, she upholds the precepts of Sir Joshua Reynolds put forward in his <span class="italic">Discourses</span>. In particular his endorsement of the generally held belief that artists should study but not slavishly copy the old masters and that &#145;Nature is still a nobler resource&#146; are two precepts on which Miss Kendrick's advice to her pupil are founded  (Kendrick, 37). Hogarth's belief that &#145;a gentle, waving serpentine line is the line of beauty&#146; also finds expression in her conversations  (ibid., 11). In addition to this evidence of Miss Kendrick's theoretical knowledge of her art, however, her belief that &#145;art [is] poor when compared with the sublime grandeur of Nature&#146;  (ibid., 37) and that &#145;a soul or spirit should breathe through the whole, and it should be rather the expression than the mere lines of a face which you should try to represent&#146;  (ibid., 41) places her work (like that of some of her more notable subjects) securely within the context of nineteenth-century Romanticism rather than under the theoretical (or social) constraints imposed on, or by, eighteenth-century portraiture. Among the works that she exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s and 1830s were several with titles indicating that they were based on the works of Byron or Scott. In 1839 the miniature painter James Holmes (who knew both Byron, of whom he painted several portraits, and Lady Caroline Lamb) exhibited at the Royal Academy a portrait of Miss Kendrick.<br>
<br>Miss Kendrick died at her home, 88 Albany Street, Regent's Park, London, where she had lived with her sister, Josephia Jane Mary Kendrick, on 6 April 1871, aged eighty-three.<br>
