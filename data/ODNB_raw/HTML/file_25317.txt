<span class="headword">Shelton, Sir  Richard</span>  (1578&#150;1647), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in Birmingham on 21 January 1578, the elder of two sons of John Shelton (<i>d</i>. 1601), a mercer there, and Barbara, the daughter and heir of Francis Stanley of West Bromwich. Shelton appears to have studied at Cambridge during the early or mid-1590s&#151;he would also serve there as university counsel in 1625&#150;31. He was at Clement's Inn and then proceeded to the Inner Temple in 1597, being called to the bar on 8 July 1606. During the late 1610s or early 1620s he joined the retinue of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, and possibly because of this he gained a series of prestigious offices at the Temple, being called to the bench on 26 January 1623, serving as Lenten reader in 1625, and finally being appointed treasurer on 3 November 1628, an office he would hold until November 1634. In October 1625 the duke obtained for him the office of solicitor-general. It was customary for solicitors-general who had not been knighted to have that honour bestowed with their office, and he was knighted on 31 October 1625 by Charles I, at Hampton Court.<br>
<br>During the parliaments of 1626 and 1628&#150;9 Shelton served in the Commons as a member from Bridgnorth, Shropshire (he was also elected, but did not sit, for Guildford in 1626). His performance in parliament was undistinguished, especially given that the solicitor-general was expected to be a major spokesman for the court. Although he served as chair of the committee of the whole on supply in 1628&#150;9, was appointed to a number of committees, and carried out various directives of the house, these assignments may have reflected more a sense of his status than of his ability. He was only moderately active in debate and does not appear to have had much influence. In March 1628 his intrusion into a debate on the ramifications of the five knights' case seriously compromised court strategy, while prompting a response from John Selden which included sarcasm at Shelton's &#145;ingenuity&#146; in searching out precedents for the case.<br>
<br>As solicitor-general Shelton was appointed to a commission to compound with recusants in November 1625 and in December 1633 to the reinforced high commission, which exercised ecclesiastical jurisdiction in England and Wales. During a Commons debate in February 1629 he defended the appointment of Richard Mountague, object of attack in the Commons, as bishop of Chichester. Neither his support for Mountague nor his presence on the commissions reveals his religious stance, since he was simply following crown initiatives. After the assassination of Buckingham in August 1628 Shelton does not appear to have had a major patron. When Sir Robert Heath was appointed chief justice of the common pleas in October 1631 it was not Shelton, but William Noy, who succeeded him as attorney-general, although the succession of the solicitor-general to the post would have followed the usual pattern. It is not known whether Shelton pushed his case for promotion; if he did, his failure may have been because he lacked a strong patron or ally at court.<br>
<br>In October 1634 Shelton was pressured into surrendering his patent as solicitor-general. Since he was not accused of misbehaviour, he could not simply be dismissed. Instead, he was able to negotiate a settlement that left him king's counsellor-at-large, with his former status and profits, and it appears that he could have opted for appointments as king's serjeant or puisne justice. In referring to his removal from office Edward Hyde, later earl of Clarendon, described him as &#145;an old, illiterate, useless person&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.110), but however fair this characterization may be it is unlikely that Shelton was forced out for sheer incompetence. Rather it appears that William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, was cementing his power at court and wanted law officers in place who were loyal to him, as was Sir Edward Littleton, Shelton's successor.<br>
<br>Shelton does not seem to have been significantly involved with government business after he gave up his place as solicitor-general, although in March 1639 he joined other Inner Temple benchers in making a contribution to support the king's expedition against the Scots. By that time he was semi-retired, living on his manor at West Bromwich (a property that he had inherited from a cousin, William Stanley, in 1626) with his wife, Lettice (<i>d</i>. 1642), the daughter of Sir Robert Fisher of Packington. He contributed &pound;150 to the Staffordshire parliamentarian county committee in 1644. He died in 1647 and was buried in West Bromwich on 7 December. The Sheltons left no children. West Bromwich passed to a nephew, John, who had also benefited from the family tie when in April 1629 he gained special admission to the Inner Temple at Shelton's behest.<br>
