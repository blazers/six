<span class="headword">Bowden,  Samuel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1733&#150;1761), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, of Frome, Somerset, the dates of whose birth and death are not known, was the author of two volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Poetical Essays on Several Occasions</span> (2 vols., 1733, 1735) and <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects. With some Essays in Prose, and a Treatise on Health</span> (1754). A footnote in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, presumably by John Nichols, the editor of the periodical, states that Bowden<blockquote>was a worthy physician and ingenious poet of Frome, a particular friend of Mrs. Rowe (being of the same communion, and living after her death in the same house,) Lord Orrery &amp;. Two volumes of his poems were published by subscription, and several of his pieces have appeared occasionally in our miscellany [the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>]. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 48, 1778, 485)</blockquote>The word &#145;was&#146; in the description of Bowden gives a <i>terminus ad quem</i> of his life. One piece in Nichols's &#145;miscellany&#146; appeared in the number for September 1776, a poem titled &#145;On his Majesty's Intended Marriage to the Princess of Mecklenberg, and her Arrival in England&#146; (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 46, 1776, 424). The poem, in undistinguished couplets, was from Frome and dated 5 September 1761, making it an occasional poem, as George III was married on 8 September of that year. Bowden's poem begins:<blockquote>
<div>Britannia's monarch, whom three realms obey,<br>
</div>
<div>And the more spacious kingdoms of the sea,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>with its unabashed borrowing, in the opening line, from Pope's <span class="italic">Rape of the Lock</span>: &#145;Here Thou, Great <i>Anna</i>, whom three Realms obey&#146;. The reference to Mrs Rowe in the 1778 <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> is to the nonconformist poetess Elizabeth Rowe, who was buried in the meeting-house at Frome. James Theobald, earl of Orrery, was one of her correspondents. The Presbyterian minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3024/', "John Bowden (d. 1750)")</script>, thought to be Samuel's brother, was in Frome prior to 1700, and it was for him that the meeting-house in Rook Lane was built in 1707. It was he who preached Mrs Rowe's funeral sermon in 1739. In the 1750s a Mrs John Bowden kept lodgings in Bath, where the second of Bowden's works was published, suggesting the possibility of a familial connection.<br>
