<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carter,  Thomas Thellusson</span>  (1808&#150;1901), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Keate's Lane, Eton, on 19 March 1808, the younger son of the Revd Thomas Carter, lower master and afterwards vice-provost of Eton College, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Henry Proctor of Clewer. He had a brother and five sisters. He entered Eton College aged six and spent twelve years there, leaving as captain of the oppidans. After matriculating at Christ Church, Oxford, on 8 December 1825, he went into residence in 1827. There he met Edward Bouverie Pusey, one of his father's former pupils, who in 1828 became regius professor of Hebrew; W. E. Gladstone was Carter's junior by a year. Carter graduated with a first class in classics in 1831 and sat unsuccessfully for an Oriel fellowship, but left Oxford before the Tractarian movement developed, following Keble's assize sermon in July 1833.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1832 Carter was ordained deacon by Bishop Burgess of Salisbury and was licensed to St Mary's, Reading, of which Henry Hart Milman (1791&#150;1868) was vicar. Following his ordination to the priesthood by the bishop of Lincoln on 22 December 1833, he went to Burnham, Buckinghamshire, as his father's curate. While there he was greatly influenced by the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, which were then being published. On 26 November 1835 Carter married Mary Anne Gould (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of John Gould of Amberd, near Taunton, and they had a son and two daughters. She had been a childhood friend of Richard Hurrell Froude (1803&#150;1836), and it was through the Goulds that Carter met Tractarian sympathizers. In 1838 he became rector of Piddlehinton, near Dorchester, in Dorset, an unhappy appointment during which his health suffered. From 1842 to 1844 he took leave of absence and returned to Burnham; in 1844 he was appointed rector of Clewer, near Windsor. Clewer found in Carter a zealous incumbent bent on social as well as ecclesiological reform. Aided by his friend the architect Henry Woodyer (1816&#150;1896), he restored the fabric of Clewer church, established two mission churches within the parish, and brought order and dignity into the worship, steadily developing the ritual used and the doctrine taught. A benefit society was established to aid the poor; part of the glebe was given for allotments and, in an attempt to stem the drink problem, a temperance society was started.<br>
<br>Clewer parish was large and included a slum district known as Clewer Fields. Two army barracks and a large number of itinerant railway navvies compounded the social problems of drink, poverty, and prostitution. In December 1848 Mariquita Tennant (1811&#150;1860), a widow living in Clewer, rescued a young woman from a life of poverty and abuse in Clewer Fields; she soon had over a dozen women under her roof in what became the Clewer House of Mercy. Carter, who had been influenced by the writings of the Revd John Armstrong (1813&#150;1856), later bishop of Grahamstown, Cape Colony, on the need for church rescue work, supported her efforts to found a religious community, but ill health forced her to withdraw in 1851. Carter was fortunate in Mrs Tennant's successor, the recently widowed Harriet Monsell (1811&#150;1883), who was installed as mother superior of the newly founded Community of St John Baptist, Clewer, on 30 November 1852.<br>
<br>The work of the community was conducted on clearly defined lines and led to over forty branch houses, besides extensive work in the United States and India. The development of sisterhoods was viewed by many with alarm, provoked controversy, and caused Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, much anxiety, although he remained the visitor until his translation to Winchester in 1869. Owing to the nature of Carter's pastoral work and his role in the revival of the religious life, requests for spiritual direction came to him from all sides, and he discharged the task with growing conviction and sympathy. Perhaps the most widely used of his books was <span class="italic">The Treasury of Devotion</span> (1869). He also pioneered the retreat movement and led some of the earliest recorded retreats in the Church of England.<br>
<br>In the midst of the controversies surrounding ritualism within the church, Carter found a role both as leader and conciliator. He was an early member and vice-president of the English Church Union, founded in 1859, and in 1875 suggested the so-called &#145;six points&#146; as a guideline for ritual practice. His role of warden at the Clewer House of Mercy had deepened his awareness of the importance of sacramental confession, leading to one of his major works, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Confession in the Church of England</span> (1865). When, in 1873, amid great controversy, a petition signed by 483 clergymen requesting the education, selection, and licensing of duly qualified confessors was read in the Canterbury convocation, Carter and others drew up a <span class="italic">Declaration on Confession and Absolution, as Set Forth by the Church of England</span> as a defence of the practice. In 1878 he became the master of the influential Society of the Holy Cross during the controversy surrounding a manual for confessors entitled <span class="italic">The Priest in Absolution</span>.<br>
<br>His allegiance to the Tractarian movement led Carter to hold a high view of the sacraments and the ordained ministry. In 1856 he signed the protest against the Bath judgment in the case of Archdeacon George Denison, which was a considered statement on the doctrine of the real presence in the eucharist. A year later he published the <span class="italic">Doctrine of the Priesthood in the Church of England</span>, which was followed in 1870 by <span class="italic">The Holy Eucharist</span>. In 1862 he had been instrumental in the founding of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament and remained superior-general until 1897. In common with many of his contemporaries Carter was dismayed by biblical criticism, and in 1870 he sent to Archibald Campbell Tait, archbishop of Canterbury, the memorial of 1529 clergy against the admission to holy communion in Westminster Abbey of the interdenominational committee appointed by convocation to revise the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. In 1870 Bishop John Mackarness of Oxford acknowledged his pastoral work by making him an honorary canon of Christ Church. Though his zeal and personal charm had won over most of his parishioners, his ritual changes provoked some opposition, which in time produced appeals to the law.<br>
<br>Three times between 1871 and 1878 the law was set in motion against Carter on the charge of ritualism, and each time the bishop of Oxford vetoed proceedings. On the third occasion Dr Julius, an absentee parishioner, obtained from the queen's bench a writ of mandamus against the bishop. In March 1879 the judges found in Julius's favour; the bishop won an appeal, but Julius took the case to the House of Lords, which upheld the Court of Appeal, thus vindicating the bishop's power of veto. Carter knew, however, that the bishop disapproved of ritualism, and when the House of Lords delivered its judgment on 22 March 1880 he resigned the rectory of Clewer.<br>
<br>Carter retired to St John's Lodge, built for him by public subscription: situated opposite the Clewer House of Mercy, it enabled him to continue as warden of the house and community. He maintained a close interest in the wider church and continued to be a respected authority; following the publication of <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span> (1889) he was a signatory to a <span class="italic">Declaration on the Inspiration of Holy Scripture</span> in December 1891. In 1893 he spoke at the Birmingham church congress, and as late as 1898 addressed a meeting of priests in London on the limits of ritual.<br>
<br>Thomas Thellusson Carter died at St John's Lodge on 28 October 1901 after a short illness. Following a service in the chapel of the House of Mercy he was buried on 31 October in Clewer churchyard alongside his wife, who had died in 1869. He was survived by his two daughters, Jane, who wrote his biography, and Mary; his son, John, had died in 1899. While his detractors counted him among the ritualists, Carter was a Tractarian at heart, firmly grounded in scripture, the church fathers, and the Anglican divines. His obituarists praised his quiet dignity and his deep spirituality: the protestant journal <span class="italic">Truth</span> described him as &#145;a saintly man&#146; and the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> declared him &#145;one of the most venerated and the last of the Tractarians&#146;. Carter was one of the most influential men of his day, but, for all his wider associations, he was essentially a parish priest ministering to the people of Clewer and to the House of Mercy.<br>
