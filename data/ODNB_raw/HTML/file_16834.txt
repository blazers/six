<span class="headword">Lloyd, Sir  Godfrey</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1608, <em>d.</em> 1671?), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was the son of Sergeant-Major Brochwel Lloyd of Leighton and Moel-y-Garth, Montgomeryshire, and his wife, Honoria, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65801/', "Sir Stephen Procter")</script>. Godfrey was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16818/', "Sir Charles Lloyd (c.1602&#150;1661)")</script>, also a military engineer.<br>
<br>Much of Lloyd's early career was focused on military service abroad. Lloyd, like his father and elder brother, probably served in the Dutch army in the years before the English civil war. Between 1642 and 1644 he was a colonel in the king's northern army commanded by the earl of Newcastle. During the Commonwealth he was a captain of a company of foot in the Dutch service. He is believed to be the Captain Lloyd recalled by James II in his military memoirs as &#145;a stout choleric Welshman &hellip; bred up under the Prince of Orange&#146; and mentioned as the engineer in charge of the approach trenches at the French siege of Cond&eacute;  (Clarke, 1.253). Lloyd, proscribed as a conspirator by the English authorities, was knighted at Brussels by the exiled Charles II in 1657.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration Lloyd was appointed &#145;chief engineer of all forts, castles and fortifications etc in England and Wales&#146; in succession to his brother on 27 December 1661, with a fee of &pound;240  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 129). His petition in 1666 for arrears of pay (&pound;360) mentions that he had left the service of the duke of L&uuml;neburg in order to follow the king's service.<br>
<br>On 12 May 1666 Lloyd was commissioned captain of a company of foot guards in Portsmouth. In the following month he was superintendent of the fortification of Portsmouth Dockyard being built to the designs of Sir Bernard de Gomme. Lloyd was engaged more widely, as on 2 October that year he requested the usual allowance for thirty-nine days' service in the Isle of Wight viewing the forts, castles, and such and making a map of Yarmouth on the isle. Back in the garrison at Portsmouth in December he was again petitioning the king for arrears of pay. In April 1667 he continued to be involved with the fortification of Portsmouth Dockyard as superintendent of the works. In June he reported to the earl of Arlington that the French fleet was said to be in the channel and heading towards Guernsey and Jersey.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the Dutch raid on the Medway in June 1667 Lloyd was consulted by the king, together with Sir Bernard de Gomme, as the leading military engineers, in respect of the defences of the kingdom. By August he had become involved with the fortification of Sheerness. In that month Robert Slater reported to the navy commissioners that, having gone to Sheerness to survey the ground, the fortifications, and the laying out of the navy yard in order to present them with a &#145;plot&#146;, he was denied permission by Sir Godfrey Lloyd to do so without the king's special order, Lloyd &#145;having the command of that affair but said he would do it himself and send the first draft to His Majesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1667</i>, 387). Lloyd himself was fallible: in July he had confessed to Arlington that in his haste to wait on Prince Rupert at Sheerness he had forgotten to tell the ordnance commissioners that 590 palisades were needed for the fort at West Tilbury, with further timbers required to secure the magazine at Gravesend.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1667 Lloyd was sent &pound;150 towards his travelling charges relating to the fortifications at Portsmouth and Sheerness over the period 24 March to 7 October 1667. He was ordered on 22 January 1668 to prepare an estimate for finishing the fortifications at Sheerness, which he produced a month later. Sir Godfrey Lloyd, &#145;one of His Majeties Principal Engineers&#146;, was by then named as one of the commissioners responsible for managing the works at Sheerness. Shortly afterwards, however, he was dismissed. Charles II, commenting to Pepys on the lack of English-bred engineers, remarked that<blockquote>he never remembering any but two in all his time viz. Sir Charles (I think) Floud and Sir Godfrey Floud, the former of whom he said [was] worth very little and the latter &hellip; [was] entrusted with the designing and managing the work at Sheerness, where after spending &pound;2000 the king said he was forced to undo all that he had done and put it into the hand of Sir Bernard Degum. (<span class="italic">Samuel Pepys's Naval Minutes</span>, 28)</blockquote>On 2 April 1668 Sir Godfrey was given leave to accept the offer of the post of quartermaster-general to the States and was licensed to pass to the Netherlands and remain there for six months: he was still holding the position of quartermaster-general to the United Provinces when he made his will on 20 January 1670. He maintained his captaincy in a foot company in Colonel John Russell's regiment of guards during 1669, but in February of the following year he was succeeded in the post by Captain Arthur Broughton. During 1670 he was claiming that he had spent &pound;600 of his own money in the king's service since he had left Germany and &pound;480 of his fees as chief engineer were still due to him.<br>
<br>Lloyd appears to have died in 1671 since &pound;360 that were due to him were then paid to his executors. There is a mention that Sir Godfrey Lloyd's lady passed &#145;by one of our packet boats for Holland on 25 July 1672&#146;. His will (translated from Low Dutch) shows him married to a widow, Catherine Smith, previously married to a Thomas Claypole with whom she had a son, also named Thomas Claypole. The will was witnessed by Adriaen Ruysenaers and Peter Adriaenson Block, lidermen of the lordship of Dongen.<br>
