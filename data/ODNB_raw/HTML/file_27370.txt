<span class="headword">Thorold,  Anthony Wilson</span>  (1825&#150;1895), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was born at Hougham, Lincolnshire, on 13 June 1825. His father, Edward Thorold, was the fourth son of Sir John Thorold, ninth baronet, and held the family living of Hougham-cum-Marston, Lincolnshire. His mother was Mary, daughter of Thomas Wilson of Grantham, Lincolnshire. Thorold was educated privately, and matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in 1843. Having obtained an honorary fourth class in mathematics he graduated BA in 1847 and MA in 1850, receiving the degree of DD by diploma on 29 May 1877. Thorold was ordained deacon in 1849 and priest in 1850. He married in 1850 Henrietta, daughter of Thomas Greene MP. In opinion he belonged to the evangelical school. His first curacy was the parish of Whittington, Lancashire, where he worked from 1849 until 1854. Three years at Holy Trinity, Marylebone, followed, and then, in 1857, the exertions of his friends procured for him the lord chancellor's living of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, where he became well known as a preacher and organizer. He also began to write, and was one of the early contributors to <span class="italic">Good Words</span>. His first wife died in October 1859 and he married, in 1865, Emily, daughter of John Labouchere.<br>
<br>Ill health led Thorold to resign St Giles's in 1867. But after a little rest and a short incumbency at Curzon Chapel, Mayfair (1868&#150;9), he resumed parish work in 1869 as vicar of St Pancras, London. Here, as at St Giles's, he showed organizing power. He improved the schools of the parish, was one of the first to adopt parochial missions, and was returned in 1870 as a member for Marylebone to the first school board for London. In 1874 Archbishop Thomson, formerly a tutor at Queen's College and for whom he had long worked as examining chaplain, gave Thorold a residentiary canonry in York Cathedral. Higher promotion soon came. In 1877 Disraeli offered him the see of Rochester, one of several appointments of low-churchmen by Disraeli. He was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 25 July.<br>
<br>The great work of Thorold's episcopate was his extensive reorganization of the diocese, and he has been considered an example of a devoted parish priest who made an admirable bishop  (Carpenter, 283). He consolidated the existing diocesan organizations; carried to a successful issue a Ten Churches Fund; encouraged the settlement of public school and college missions in south London; promoted diocesan organizations for deaconesses, lay workers, higher education, and temperance; and began the restoration of St Saviour's, Southwark, projecting its elevation to the rank of a quasi-cathedral. For recreation he travelled much, going as far afield as America and Australia. He spoke occasionally and with effect in the House of Lords, and he was one of the assessors in the trial of the bishop of Lincoln at Lambeth in 1889. In 1890 he succeeded Harold Browne in the see of Winchester. But his health was not equal to the business of the diocese. He died, worn out, at Farnham Castle, Farnham, Surrey, on 25 July 1895, the eighteenth anniversary of his consecration. His second wife had predeceased him in December 1877.<br>
<br>Although without striking characteristics or powerful mind, Thorold had a grasp of detail, and inspired others as much by his own industry as by his words. Strong mannerisms repelled many, but threw into relief his real sincerity and goodness. He read widely, and, although given to tricks of style, he both spoke and wrote well. His published works were exclusively devotional or diocesan.<br>
