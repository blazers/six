<span class="headword">Mackay,  Helen Marion McPherson</span>  (1891&#150;1965), <span class="occ">paediatrician</span>, was born on 23 May 1891 in Inverness, Scotland, the second of three children and only daughter of Duncan Lachlan Mackay, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Marion Gordon Campbell Mackay (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wimberley), the daughter of Douglas Wimberley JP of Inverness. Her early years were spent in Burma, where she was educated at home. She entered Cheltenham Ladies' College at the age of fifteen and went on to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women (Royal Free Hospital) and qualified MRCS, LRCP, and MB BS (London) in 1914. It was very difficult at that time for a woman to pursue a career in a medical speciality but there were some opportunities in paediatrics and she managed to obtain an appointment as house physician and surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children in Hackney. She belonged to a generation of paediatricians who took part in the development of paediatrics as a speciality distinct from adult medicine and was one of the first women to be appointed as a hospital consultant in any speciality. She became MRCP and MD (London) in 1917.<br>
<br>In 1920 Mackay became the first woman to be appointed as physician to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Soon after her appointment she went to Vienna with a team of British scientists from the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, led by Harriette Chick, to research into the cause and prevention of rickets, an extremely common disease in the famine which occurred in the aftermath of the First World War. This study provided important evidence for the role of cod liver oil and sunlight in the prevention and cure of rickets in childhood. The Medical Research Council's <span class="roman">Special Report</span> 77 summarized their work in Vienna. While in Vienna Mackay observed that anaemia was even more common than rickets and became interested in finding the cause. Having found that many of the anaemic infants in Vienna improved with iron therapy, she returned to London and made further studies on anaemia in childhood. Using the same scientific rigour that characterized the study on rickets and working with a medical statistician, Major Greenwood, she became the first person to show that iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia in children, to study its epidemiology, and to draw attention to the importance of its prevention. Her <span class="italic">Nutritional Anaemia in Infancy</span> was published in 1931, and the findings of her studies still summarize fairly accurately much of our present day knowledge of iron deficiency anaemia in infancy.<br>
<br>Mackay worked as a consultant paediatrician to the Mother's Hospital, Clapton, and to Hackney Hospital until her retirement in 1959 and made many research contributions into the nutrition of new-born babies and young children. In 1934 she became the first woman to be made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. Her widest reputation came from her research work but the deep respect and affection with which she was held locally came from her unfailing commitment to her clinical work in the East End of London. She encouraged and inspired many young paediatricians, notably Ciceley Williams, who described the nutritional disorder of kwashiorkor. Mackay recognized the importance of social factors in child health and was one of the first paediatricians to take paediatric care outside hospital into the community. She leaned to the left in her political views but was not politically active. She had no conspicuous religious beliefs.<br>
<br>Dressed in the familiar brown suit and tie she wore every day, and sometimes sporting a trilby hat, Mackay had a somewhat severe physical presence but her smile was warm and kind. She had an engaging honesty and lack of self-importance. She was reserved, with a quiet voice, and had little small talk but could be firm and show disapproval when necessary. She never married. Lorel Goodfellow (<i>d</i>. 1988), a laboratory scientist, with whom she wrote one of her first papers on anaemia, became her lifelong companion. Visitors to their home were amused to find that they always called each other &#145;Mackay&#146; and &#145;Goodfellow&#146;. Outside medicine, her abiding interest was ornithology and she belonged to more societies concerned with this pursuit than with medicine. Mackay died of a stroke in the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in London on 17 July 1965 and was buried on the 20th at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
