<span class="headword">Campbell, Sir  David</span>  (1889&#150;1978), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Patna, Ayrshire, on 6 May 1889, the son of Agnes Smith Campbell, a seamstress. He was educated, by scholarships throughout, at Ayr Academy and at Glasgow University, where he graduated BSc and MA with honours in 1911 and MB ChB with honours in 1916, the most distinguished graduate of his year. He served as captain and then acting major in the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1916 to 1919 and in France in 1918 was awarded the MC as an immediate decoration in the field. On demobilization he returned to Glasgow as assistant to the renowned Professor Ralph Stockman in materia medica and therapeutics and in 1921 became Pollok lecturer in materia medica and pharmacology. On 4 August the same year Campbell married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1890/91), a schoolteacher, daughter of Alexander Lyle, head teacher at Kerse near Grangemouth, and his wife, Isabella Paterson. Campbell often said that this was by far the best thing he had ever done. There were no children. In 1924 he took his MD with honours with a thesis on rheumatoid arthritis, winning the coveted Bellahouston gold medal. He spent 1925&#150;6 as Rockefeller medical fellow at Johns Hopkins University, and in 1928 published <span class="italic">A Handbook of Therapeutics</span>, a great advance in its time on most preceding textbooks in the subject. During this period he was physician to out-patients (1920&#150;29) and later assistant physician (1929&#150;30) to the Western Infirmary, Glasgow.<br>
<br>The phase of major public achievement in Campbell's career opened with his appointment to the regius chair of materia medica in Aberdeen in 1930. Within two years he was dean of the faculty, a post he held for twenty-seven years until his retirement in 1959. He found the Aberdeen school in an early stage of outward-looking reform, and accelerated the process immensely. His shrewdness, pawky humour, tight mental discipline, nice judicial sense, and firmness with opposition made him a formidable chairman and administrator. Several major and beneficial appointments were largely to his credit, notably those of James Learmonth in surgery, Dugald Baird in obstetrics, and John Stirling Young in pathology. He put his influence behind the creation of an imaginative medical complex on the spacious heights of Foresterhill, to include the clinical and related departments of the university and soon to become the envy of many other medical schools. At the same time he ran an efficient department and was a conscientious and approachable teacher: his lecture notes, meticulously written out as they were meant to be read, with nicely judged classical allusion and quotation, bear witness to a medical scholarliness regrettably all but dead. His lectures on tea, tobacco, and alcohol are particularly remembered.<br>
<br>In 1936 Campbell joined the General Medical Council as representative of Aberdeen University and in 1949 became its president, serving also as chairman of its disciplinary committee. The challenges he met there on a larger scale were similar to those he had faced earlier in Aberdeen, and the same qualities again served him well. Those post-war years were a time of radical and potentially stressful change for medical education and practice, and a more volatile personality than Campbell's might have served these causes less well than he did. He resigned from the council in 1961.<br>
<br>Campbell was knighted in 1953. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Glasgow, Liverpool, Dublin, and Aberdeen and of DCL from Durham. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the royal colleges of physicians of London and of Glasgow.<br>
<br>In his long retirement Campbell was a kenspeckle figure often seen on the Aberdeen golf links and occasionally in the medical school. He excelled in golf and also in billiards: he is believed in Aberdeen to have been billiards champion of the Athenaeum. For many years he organized, with the flair and efficiency once devoted to more serious things, an annual golf competition for which he was the handicapper, later presenting the Ashley Mackintosh cup to the winners at the annual dinner of the Aberdeen Medico-Chirurgical Society; year by year the company waited affectionately for the well-known references in his presentation speech, not only to the competition but to settled convictions of Campbell himself&#151;rabbits and tigers in handicapping, and the best of all arrangements being a committee of one, with powers.<br>
<br>Campbell died from cardiac failure at his home, 252 North Deeside Road, Milltimber, Peterculter, Aberdeenshire, on 30 May 1978. Lady Campbell survived him.<br>
