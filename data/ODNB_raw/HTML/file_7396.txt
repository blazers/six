<span class="headword">Deas, Sir  David</span>  (1807&#150;1876), <span class="occ">naval medical officer</span>, son of Francis Deas (<i>d</i>. 1857), provost of Falkland, Fife, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of David Moyes, was born at Falkland in September 1807. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and the University of Edinburgh, and became a licentiate of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1827.<br>
<br>Deas entered the Royal Navy on 7 June 1828 as an assistant surgeon. He saw much service, and in July 1836, at the age of twenty-nine, he was promoted to the rank of surgeon. Before his return to Britain in 1842 he took part in the operations on the coast of Syria and at the Cape of Good Hope. He was promoted to the rank of deputy inspector of hospitals and fleets in June 1854, and was on the <i>Britannia</i> during the engagement with the sea defences of Sevastopol on 17 October. In March 1855 he was gazetted inspector-general of the Black sea Fleet and served on the <i>Royal Albert</i> until the end of the war with Russia. He served with the fleet on the coast of China, and his attention to the sick and wounded at the capture of Canton (Guangzhou) on 28&#150;9 December 1857 was specially mentioned by the commander-in-chief, Michael Seymour  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 1858, 1024). On his return to Britain Deas was appointed senior inspector-general of Haslar naval hospital, Portsmouth, a post he retained for eight years, in that time instituting many reforms. In July 1860 he married Margaret Hepburn, daughter of William Hepburn. Deas retired from active service in March 1872.<br>
<br>Deas never rose to the position of director-general, despite predictions to the contrary by contemporaries. He was a respected administrator, had a reputation for singleness of purpose, and showed great compassion for the sick and wounded under his charge. In 1856 he was nominated CB, and in 1867 he was promoted to KCB. He was awarded a good-service pension in 1869. Deas held the Syrian medal, the Crimean medal with Sevastopol clasp, and the Turkish medal, was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and wore the order of the Mejidiye of the fourth class. Deas died on 15 January 1876 at 32 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, the home of his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7397/', "Sir George Deas")</script>, and he was buried in the Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh, four days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
