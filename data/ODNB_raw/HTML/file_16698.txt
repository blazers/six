<span class="headword">Lindsay,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1639/40), <span class="occ">bishop of Edinburgh</span>, was the son of John Lindsay of Edzell, and graduated as master of arts at St Andrews University in 1593. He became master of the grammar school of Montrose before moving to be master at Dundee in 1597. He was minister of Dundee from about 1604 to 1618, a parish conveniently close to the estate he owned at Dunkenny in Forfarshire. By 1603 he was married to Christian Rutherford, widow of the former master of Dundee School, and after her death he married Katherine, daughter of Gilbert Ramsay of Banff.<br>
<br>Lindsay was appointed to the Scottish court of high commission in 1616. On 12 July 1617 he proposed and defended theses on the power of princes in a public disputation in St Andrews before James VI. His theses, published as <span class="italic">De potestate principis aphorisme</span> (1617), argued that the king was <i>summus gubernator</i> (supreme governor) of the kirk, able to command all things that were &#145;not repugnant to the will of God&#146;, his powers including the right to determine forms of worship  (Mullan, 121). He followed this up by supporting the reforms that became known as the five articles of Perth in the 1618 general assembly, and he was elected bishop of Brechin on 10 April 1619 (consecrated on 23 November).<br>
<br>Pamphlets of 1619 on communion, and of 1621 defending the articles, confirmed Lindsay as one of the most active supporters of royal policy in the kirk, and he crowned Charles I at his Scottish coronation on 18 June 1633 after a sermon &#145;wherein he had some good exhortations to his Majestie&#146;, an opponent admitted, though they were &#145;general and ambiguous&#146;  (Row, 362&#150;3). On 31 July 1634 he was admitted to the Scottish privy council, and in the same year became a justice of the peace and a commissioner of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Lindsay was transferred to the bishopric of Edinburgh on 16 September 1634, and in his capacity as bishop was present in St Giles on 23 July 1637 when the dean began to read the new prayer book introduced by Charles I. In the rioting by protesters that followed Lindsay became a prime target as protesters &#145;beganne to throw at him stooles and ther very bybles &hellip; And it is reported, that he hardly escaped the blow of a stoole&#146;  (Gordon, 1.7&#150;8). Order was restored and he managed to preach his sermon, though he was assaulted in the streets afterwards and was unable to get into his lodgings, but was rescued by servants of the earl of Wemyss. He ventured out in the afternoon to hold a second service in the church, from which women (who had led the disorders) were excluded. Afterwards he had to be protected by footmen with drawn swords as he drove to Holyroodhouse with the earl of Roxburghe in the latter's coach, harassed by a stone-throwing mob shouting &#145;Kill the traitour&#146;  (Lippe, 174). Hostile accounts of his absurd &#145;crying to the people, That he had no wyt [knowledge] of the matter&#146;  (Row, 409) and that &#145;his greatnesse&#146; displayed physical symptoms of extreme terror  (J. Leslie, <span class="italic">True Relation</span>, 1830, 199&#150;200) are doubtless exaggerated propaganda.<br>
<br>After refusing to submit to the authority of the covenanters' general assembly in 1638 Lindsay prepared for the dangers ahead by making his will, on 2 December. He was deprived of office and excommunicated on 13 December. Like the other Scottish bishops he then fled to England, where he died in 1639 or 1640. The date of the death of his wife, who was alive in December 1638, is unknown.<br>
<br>Lindsay had proved &#145;A tough opponent&#146;  (Mullan, 155) in debate with those resisting James VI's reforms of worship. His resolutions in favour of the Perth articles earned him&#151;from an opponent&#151;the nickname Dr Resolutus  (Calderwood, 7.396). He took little part in the formulation of religious policies under Charles I, and the rumour that he tried to get some of the &#145;trashe&#146; of the English liturgy left out of the new Scottish prayer book  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, ed. D. Laing, 3 vols., 1841&#150;2, 1.4) may indicate that he was not entirely happy with the king's reforms, though his obedience remained unswerving.<br>
