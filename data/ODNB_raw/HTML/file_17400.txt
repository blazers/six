<span class="headword">Maccormick,  Joseph</span>  (1733&#150;1799), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at St Andrews on 22 January 1733, the son of John Maccormick, a minister in that town. He graduated MA at St Andrews University in 1750 and was granted a bursary in theology from the university exchequer in the same year. After serving as tutor in the Hepburn family at Clarkington, he entered in 1756 upon trials before the presbytery of Dalkeith. Maccormick was early affiliated with the moderate literati settled in the general vicinity of Edinburgh, including William Robertson, Alexander Carlyle, and John Home. His attendance at performances of Home's <span class="italic">Douglas</span> in 1756 was opposed by the presbytery of Dalkeith, which consequently transferred his trials to the presbytery of Edinburgh. He was there licensed on 30 March 1757 and ordained minister of Kilmany, Fife, on 17 April 1758. He was presented by Robert Hepburn of Baads to the living of Temple on 21 November 1760, and while there, in 1766, had the degree of DD conferred upon him by St Andrews University. He married, on 7 May 1770, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter of Joseph Simson, a Bristol merchant; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Through the favour of Janet, countess of Hyndford, Maccormick was transferred in 1771 to Prestonpans, where he edited his only major work, <span class="italic">State-papers and letters, addressed to William Carstares &hellip; to which is prefixed the life of Mr. Carstares</span> (1774). The documents included in this collection had come into the hands of Charles Mackie, professor of civil history at Edinburgh University, as trustee to Carstares's widow. He in turn entrusted them to Maccormick, who was Carstares's great-nephew, along with some materials for a life. Prefixed to the letters are memoirs of the correspondents taken from the manuscript of &#145;The characters of the court of Great Britain&#146;, in the earl of Hyndford's library. William Robertson, Maccormick's long time friend and ally, was active in helping him secure a publisher.<br>
<br>In May 1782 Maccormick was elected moderator of the general assembly, and in the following July, thanks again to the support of Robertson, he was presented by George III to the charge of St Leonards in his native presbytery in conjunction with the principalship of the United College of St Andrews. He was appointed one of the deans of the Chapel Royal on 19 July 1788, and he was a non-resident fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Alexander Carlyle's judgement of him is well known, &#145;rather a Merry Andrew, than a Wit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 134), as is Walter Scott's complaint that as a boy he &#145;yawnd under the inflictions of a Doctor M'Cormick, a name in which dullness seems to have been hereditary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 602). But these comments obscure his genuine accomplishments as a steadfast supporter of the moderate party. A member of the general assembly on seven occasions, he was one of the speakers backing Robertson's effort to repeal the Catholic penal laws in 1778. The documents comprising the <span class="italic">State-Papers</span> have been relied upon by later historians and biographers. Maccormick's life of Carstares, with its portrayal of Carstares's public role as leader of the Church of Scotland and of his private character as embodying tolerance, charity, and moderation, was a significant contribution to moderate ideology. Maccormick died at Edinburgh on 17 June 1799.<br>
