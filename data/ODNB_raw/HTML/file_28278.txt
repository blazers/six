<span class="headword">Viger,  Denis-Benjamin</span>  (1774&#150;1861), <span class="occ">politician in Canada</span>, born at Montreal on 19 August 1774, was the only son of Denis Viger (<i>b</i>. 1741), a businessman and member of the house of assembly, and his wife, P&eacute;rine-Charles (<i>d</i>. 1823), the second daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois-Pierre Cherrier. He was educated at the Coll&egrave;ge de Montr&eacute;al, and, after serving articles (1794&#150;9), was called to the bar on 9 March 1799, where he soon became distinguished. On 21 November 1808 he married Marie-Amable (<i>d</i>. 1854), the daughter of Pierre Foretier. Their one child, a daughter, died in infancy.<br>
<br>Viger entered the assembly as member for Montreal in 1808, and, being a cousin of Louis-Joseph Papineau, espoused the popular side. In 1809 he issued a pamphlet urging in the interests of Great Britain that the manners and institutions of the French Canadians should be preserved. When the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14 broke out he was promoted captain in the militia; he served until the end of the war. From 1810 to 1814 Viger represented the county of Leinster in the legislature, and from 1827 to 1830 that of Kent. In 1828 he was chosen by the legislature as one of three delegates to proceed to Westminster as the exponent of their grievances. In 1830 he became a member of the legislative council, and in 1831 was again sent to England as the legislature's agent. He remained there until 1834, and was joined at times by other colonial leaders, including William Lyon Mackenzie. During the rebellions of 1837 and 1838 he played an obscure role in financing radical newspapers, and on 4 November 1838 he was arrested for seditious articles published in one of these. Having declined bail, he was kept in prison for nineteen months.<br>
<br>In 1841, when the two Canadas were united, Viger entered the new parliament as member for Richelieu county, and in 1845 was elected member for Trois Rivi&egrave;res. He denounced the union because it did not respect representation by population and restricted the use of French. However, when in 1843 the Liberals resigned, Viger, who appreciated the statesmanship of Sir Charles Metcalfe's policy and had supported him in his quarrel with the ministry, was sworn in as president of the council (12 December 1843). He was virtually head of the administration until 2 September 1844. The French Canadians, however, failed to understand his motives, and owing to the general dissatisfaction he was forced to resign in June 1846. On 25 February 1848 he was again called to the upper house; but, tired of political struggles, he did not attend. In 1858 his seat was declared vacant. He died at Montreal on 13 February 1861. Viger Square and Viger Garden in Montreal were named after him.<br>
