<span class="headword">Vigors,  Nicholas Aylward</span>  (1785/6&#150;1840), <span class="occ">zoological administrator and quinarian</span>, was born at Old Leighlin, co. Carlow, Ireland, the son of Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1755&#150;1828) and his first wife, Catherine, daughter of Solomon Richards of Solsboro, co. Wexford. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1803, and was also admitted a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1806. Leaving Oxford in 1809, after preparing for publication <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature and Extent of Poetick Licence</span> (1810), he purchased an ensigncy in the Grenadier Guards. He was severely wounded during the Peninsular War in 1811. Invalided home, he left the army and returned to Oxford, graduating BA in 1817.<br>
<br>As a wealthy gentleman Vigors devoted himself to ornithology and entomology, becoming a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1819. It was here that his gifts as a reforming administrator and systematist became apparent. He reacted against the Linnean's botanical emphasis, slow publication rate, and old methodology, and (with W. S. MacLeay, J. F. Stephens, Adrian Howarth, and others) formed the semi-autonomous Zoological Club on 27 November 1822. It became a forum for the zoological careerists at the hub of an expanding maritime nation and for methodological dissidents (Vigors was a quinarian) rebelling against Linnaean systematics. It also set the trend for enthusiast-driven societies, being less formal and socially stratified, and it prepared the way for more regional autonomy of scientific disciplines. While still in the Linnean orbit, the club had its own by-laws (drawn up by Vigors and others), electoral procedures, subscriptions, and fast publication in its own cheap house organ, the <span class="italic">Zoological Journal</span> (1824&#150;34), which allowed free taxonomic discussion.<br>
<br>By the mid-1820s Vigors was the leading quinarian, arguing for a geometric ordering of species, orders, and families into sets of five bounded by a circle, a system pioneered by William MacLeay (1792&#150;1865). The general minutes testify that Vigors, the secretary of the club and its last chairman in 1828&#150;9, was the real power. He exhibited specimens and circular charts, and steered discussions towards quinarian explanations. Quinarianism provided a strong heuristic and led to his overhaul of avian classification in &#145;Observations on the natural affinities that connect the orders and families of birds&#146;, read at the club in 1824 and published in 1825. Vigors wrote on birds, mammals, and insects in the <span class="italic">Zoological Journal</span> and in 1827 became its principal editor until the journal closed in 1834.<br>
<br>Vigors was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in February 1826. By then his discomfort at an increasingly restrictive Linnean Society was apparent. As a result the Zoological Club's personnel slid readily into managerial positions at the new Zoological Society. It was Vigors, with Joseph Sabine and Sir Stamford Raffles, who drew up the prospectus for the Zoological Society in February 1826, and it was founded in April, with Vigors as its first secretary. He was joined by E. T. Bennett, his Zoological Club assistant, as vice-secretary in 1827.<br>
<br>Vigors's organizational flair was again apparent. The Zoological Society minutes show that he, Sabine, and Lord Auckland were the driving force in the early years. Vigors's careerists, interested in systematic science and a vocation from imperial gains, staffed the society's museum in Bruton Street, Mayfair. However, they were often at odds with the aristocrats, who, as the titular heads of the promenading gardens, saw the zoo's role as a game park, to provide exotic delicacies for the nobleman's table. Vigors donated his preserved birds to the museum, as well as display cases and cabinets of insects. He bought collections at auction and catalogued the museum's birds and mammals. Bruton Street became a repository for specimens gathered during surveying voyages. Captain Phillip Parker King of the <i>Beagle</i> had Vigors examine his birds, and it was Vigors who described the birds of the American north-west from Captain Frederick Beechey's voyage in the <i>Blossom</i>. Vigors's forty-odd papers (some co-authored with Thomas Horsfield) covered a wide ornithological range and introduced many new species.<br>
<br>The zoological gardens, according to Humphry Davy's original plan, were to exhibit animals of the colonies and assert London's global pre-eminence. Vigors's zoology too spoke of imperial pride and he sparked a rash of anti-Gallic papers from the Bruton Street careerists. The former grenadier, who had seen war with France, insisted that her Napoleonic days of appropriating nature were over. However, his domineering style alienated outsiders, not least the prickly William Swainson, who accused Vigors of bureaucratic dictatorship.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1828 Vigors succeeded to the family estate in co. Carlow, although he spent the scientific season at his house in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park. He was created an honorary DCL by Oxford University on 4 July 1832. On 15 December 1832 he entered the reformed parliament as the member for Carlow, resigning as secretary of the Zoological Society in 1833. He was an extreme Liberal and usually voted with the radicals. He rarely spoke in the house, but he was a key radical witness before the 1836 parliamentary select committee on the British Museum, where he deplored the lack of scientifically trained commoners among the titled trustees and wanted a professional board appointed by the learned societies. In the management of science, Vigors proved himself a critical transitional figure in the move towards the hegemony of gentlemanly specialism over aristocratic interest. He lost the seat of Carlow (where he was deputy lieutenant) in 1835, but was returned in 1837, and he represented this constituency until his death at his home, Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, on 26 October 1840. He was buried in the nave of Old Leighlin Cathedral. Vigors did not marry but was survived by a son, Ferdinand Vigors (<i>b</i>. 1814/15) who went to Trinity College, Oxford, in 1833.<br>
