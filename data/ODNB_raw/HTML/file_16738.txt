<span class="headword">Linley,  William</span>  (1771&#150;1835), <span class="occ">composer and author</span>, youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16737/', "Thomas Linley the elder (1733&#150;1795)")</script> and his wife, Mary Johnson (or Johnston), was born on 27 January 1771 in Bath. Five years later his parents moved to London. In 1780 William was sent to school at Harrow (where his sister Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25364/', "Linley, Elizabeth Ann")</script>] and her husband, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, were then living). In February 1785 he was transferred to St Paul's School, and later was sent to C. F. Abel for counterpoint lessons; he also studied, so he himself said, with J. B. Cramer. His father taught him singing, however, and Coleridge, hearing him in a song of Purcell's in 1797, promptly made him the subject of a sonnet. In 1790 (and with the backing, it is said, of Charles James Fox), Linley gained a place as a writer in the East India Company and sailed for Madras, where, in 1791, he was appointed assistant under the collector of Madura and Dindigul, and, two years later, deputy secretary to the military board. His health soon gave way, however, and he was obliged to return to England, where he arrived just in time to witness his father's death in November 1795.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1796, a pantomime, <span class="italic">Harlequin Captive, or, The Magick Fire</span>, was successfully produced at Drury Lane, and in April Linley also contributed some incidental music to W. H. Ireland's Shakespearian hoax <span class="italic">Vortigern</span>. It was no doubt on the strength of his performance so far that Sheridan made him composer at Drury Lane later that year. But everything else Linley attempted over the next four seasons failed miserably. Among these were a comic opera, <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span> (1797), and an entertainment, <span class="italic">The Pavilion</span> (1799) (in which Michael Kelly had a leading role), for both of which Linley wrote not only the music but also the words. Though Sheridan had apparently agreed that he should be paid &pound;7 a week together with 2 per cent of the net profits, it seems that Linley saw very little of this; by 1800 his circumstances were so much reduced that he was more or less forced to return to India.<br>
<br>Earlier that year Linley's first novel, <span class="italic">Forbidden Apartments</span> (in two volumes), had appeared, and shortly after his arrival in Madras he began another, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Ralph Reybridge</span>, which came out in four volumes in 1809. In 1801 he became paymaster at Vellore, and in 1805 sub-treasurer and mint-master to the presidency at Fort St George&#151;two posts which were evidently sufficiently lucrative to enable him only a year or so later to return to London, where, with his inherited interest in the Drury Lane Theatre (and other properties left to him by his father), he was able, as a gentleman amateur, to devote himself to writing and composition. During this second spell of Indian service he wrote a fair amount of music, and also a number of &#145;Sonnets and odes, elegies, ballads, and sketches&#146; which later (in 1819) found their way into print (together with an account of the life and writings of Charles Leftley, a school friend at St Paul's).<br>
<br>Linley's musical output is almost entirely vocal, and consists mainly of songs and glees, only a relatively small number of which were ever published. Some are settings of his own words, and some of words by Thomas Moore (whose friendship over many years he also enjoyed). First to appear were six glees to words by Leftley, issued under the title <span class="italic">Flights of Fancy</span> in 1797, four of which were reprinted in his final set of <span class="italic">Eight Glees</span> (1832). A two-volume anthology of Shakespearian songs by Linley and various other composers (1815&#150;16) is by far his most important publication. A good many songs and glees, most of them individually dated, survive in manuscript. His church music was nearly all written for St Margaret's Chapel, Bath (of which he was a proprietor). A proposed book of critical observations on music offered to the publishers Cadell and Davies in 1811 never materialized.<br>
<br>On his return to London, Linley evidently became a good friend of Samuel Wesley, who later dedicated an organ work to him, although their friendship eventually soured. He resumed his membership of the Concentores Sodales, a vocal club at whose second meeting (on 23 June 1798) he had been present; a mason of several years' standing, he also joined the Catch and Glee clubs, and from 1809 until his death he was a member of the Madrigal Society and the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club as well. In February 1810 he was elected to the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks. The last of his line, he died unmarried at his chambers at 3 Furnival's Inn, Holborn, London, on 6 May 1835, and was buried in the family vault at St Paul's, Covent Garden. A memorial tablet to him was erected in the church. His property he left to the only daughter of his sister, Mrs Mary Tickell, and several family portraits by Lawrence, Gainsborough, and others he bequeathed to Dulwich College, of which his clergyman brother Ozias had been organist-fellow.<br>
