<span class="headword">Pode, Sir  (Edward) Julian</span>  (1902&#150;1968), <span class="occ">steel executive</span>, was born in Sheffield on 26 June 1902, the only son of Edward Pode (<i>d</i>. 1902), a master at the Royal Grammar School, and his second wife, Lilla Telfer. His father died shortly before he was born and, at the age of six, he was taken in by his uncle, John Pode, at Slade in Devon. He then began as a weekly boarder, later becoming a full boarder, at the Mount House Preparatory School at Plymouth. In April 1916 he joined the training ship <i>Conway</i>, leaving in April 1918 in a senior position with a report noting his very good executive ability. After an adventurous period in the navy, including the need to jump onto the deck of a destroyer from the sinking armed merchant cruiser <i>Otranto</i> in October 1918, he was discharged in March 1919, his eyesight having deteriorated badly under the strain of war. In April 1919 he joined a firm of chartered accountants in Sheffield, qualifying in 1924.<br>
<br>In 1926 Pode entered the steel industry by joining the staff of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds Ltd (GKN) at the Dowlais works, as district accountant. In 1930, when the heavy steel interests of that company were amalgamated with those of Baldwins Ltd to form the British (Guest Keen Baldwins) Iron and Steel Company Ltd (GKB), he was appointed secretary of the new company. In that same year he married Jean, daughter of Frank Finlayson, colliery owner of Gwynfa, Caswell, Swansea, and they set up home at Great House, Bonvilston, Glamorgan, where they brought up their son, John, and daughter, Judith. John, a Frazer scholar from Winchester, obtained a first in chemistry at Balliol College, wrote two chemistry books much used in schools, and became a housemaster at Eton College.<br>
<br>In 1938 Pode became secretary and joint commercial manager of GKB, subsequently being appointed assistant managing director (1943) and joint managing director (1945). When, in 1947, the Steel Company of Wales Ltd (SCW) was formed for the purpose of modernizing the sheet-steel and tin-plate industries of south Wales, he was appointed managing director of the new company. For fifteen years Pode guided the company through one of the biggest development projects ever carried out in the steel industry, not only raising ingot steel output from 0.5 to 3 million tons per annum, but also converting the old tin-plate industry of Wales to the new cold-reduced method.<br>
<br>These achievements reflected the construction of two new tin-plate works at Trostre, near Llanelli, and Felindre, near Swansea, and of a large-output sheet complex alongside the new strip mill at Port Talbot. In addition, the SCW, at its Orb works, Newport, and Richard Thomas and Baldwins jointly introduced the manufacture of the highly sophisticated electric sheet known as grain oriented. Pode's final major project, only completed after his death, was the construction of the new port for large ore carriers at Port Talbot. In May 1961 he was appointed deputy chairman of the SCW in addition to his position as managing director, becoming chairman in February 1962. In February 1967 he retired from the board.<br>
<br>Across all the areas of business with which he was connected, Pode was notable for his quality of leadership combined with a certain humility. He was at all times a good listener, yet in handling people he was fearless and ever ready to set an example if a difficult human decision had to be taken. He took a leading part in the energy advisory council of the Ministry of Power, becoming chairman of the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service in 1965, and the shipping policy and ore investment committee of the British Iron and Steel Federation. His business interests were many: among them, in addition to those already noted, were directorships of GKN, the Steetley Company, and Lloyds Bank (where he was also chairman of their south Wales district committee). In addition he was deputy chairman of the Hodge Group, and chairman of France, Fenwick &amp; Co. and the Prince of Wales Dry Dock Company, Swansea, Ltd.<br>
<br>Pode was high sheriff of Glamorgan in 1948 and a JP from 1951 to 1966; in 1957 he became an honorary freeman of the borough of Port Talbot, in recognition of the prominent part his industrial activities had played in the advancement of the town's prosperity, this being one of the honours he prized most. He was knighted in 1959, and became a commander of the order of St John of Jerusalem in 1963. From 1962 to 1964 he was president of the Iron and Steel Federation, having been a council member since 1945, during which time he exerted great influence on the steel trade and was a particularly outspoken opponent of nationalization, even to the extent of threatening to quit the industry in 1964 if Labour won the general election.<br>
<br>Pode was a man of wide interests in other fields, with a vivid sense of enjoyment in everything he did, accompanied by considerable skill. He was a keen competitive golfer throughout his life, at one time having a handicap of only 4, and always proved a difficult man to beat. An enthusiastic bridge player, his favourite hobby was undoubtedly racing. It was only in later years, however, when he started breeding bloodstock, that his ownership of racehorses yielded much success. He was also a keen farmer, and owned a fine pedigree herd of Guernsey cows. Towards the end of his life he also started to collect paintings, including those by William Stubbs and Richard Wilson. Never a great reader of books, he could absorb a brief with remarkable rapidity and recall the salient points accurately. There was much humour in him, and his business colleagues always hoped that he would be in to lunch for &#145;one knew it would be very entertaining&#146;.<br>
<br>In the last few months of his life, Pode suffered poor health. He died at his home, Great House, Bonvilston, Glamorgan, on 11 June 1968, and was buried in the village three days later.<br>
