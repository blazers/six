<span class="headword">Stubbe <span class="st"> [Stubbes, Stubbs]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1632&#150;1676), <span class="occ">author and physician</span>, was born on 28 February 1632 at Partney, Lincolnshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26735/', "Henry Stubbes (1605/6&#150;1678)")</script>, rector of the parish, and Mary Purefoy. They may not have been married at Henry's birth as, when he died intestate, it was said his estate was confiscated, he &#145;being a Bastard&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 12, fol. 327). Be that as it may, the &#145;anabaptistically inclined&#146; rector was soon ejected, and thereafter moved his family to Tredagh, Ireland, where&#151;as a critic of the younger Stubbe quipped years later&#151;he found employment as &#145;beadle of the beggars, as being well acquainted with the executive part of power at the carts-tail&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1068).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Following the outbreak of the Irish rising in 1641 the boy and a sibling were whisked by their mother to safety in England. They settled in London, where Mary's skill in needlework procured her a &#145;comfortable subsistence&#146;, enabling her to enrol Henry at Westminster School in 1642. A most precocious linguist, Stubbe quickly attracted the attention of the headmaster, Richard Busby, who, in turn, recommended the boy to Sir Henry Vane; he, after supporting the youth at Westminster, secured him a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1649. There Stubbe quickly distinguished himself, not only for his scholarly attainments&#151;he habitually performed his exercises in Greek&#151;but for &#145;shewing himself too forward, pragmatical and conceited (being well stock'd with impudence at school)&#146;. Indeed, Stubbe's sharp tongue and conceit often caused him to be &#145;kick'd and beaten&#146; by his fellow students and, on one occasion at least, publicly whipped in the college's refectory  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1068). In later life Stubbe also claimed that it was he who had carried the engagement to Oxford in 1650, and again he who had saved several royalist fellows of Christ Church and Queen's from expulsion.<h2>
<a name="Politicalpamphleteer"></a>Political pamphleteer</h2>While still an undergraduate Stubbe embarked on a literary career with his publication in 1651 of <span class="italic">Horae subsecivae</span> and <span class="italic">Miscellanea epigrammata</span>&#151;respectively, Greek paraphrases of two biblical stories and a translation into Greek of poems by, among others, Thomas Randolph and Richard Crashaw. After graduating BA in July 1653 Stubbe served with the parliamentary army in Scotland for two years before returning to Oxford to proceed MA in December 1656. A few weeks later he was appointed deputy keeper of the Bodleian Library thanks to the support of the Independent John Owen, dean of Christ Church, whom Stubbe assisted in polemics against the presbyterians. By early 1656 Stubbe had also befriended Thomas Hobbes, and vigorously championed his campaign against John Wallis, the Savilian professor of geometry, by attacking Wallis's linguistic competency. Stubbe also began preparing a Latin translation of Hobbes's <span class="italic">Leviathan</span>, but never completed it. At the same time, however, Stubbe was careful to deny, privately as well as publicly, charges of Hobbism. In 1658 Stubbe's crusade against Wallis became more personal, following the latter's contestable election as keeper of the Oxford archives. Stubbe vented his disapprobation by publishing <span class="italic">The Savilian Professour's Case Stated</span> but, following John Wilkins's appeal to Cromwell, was forced on 5 May by vice-chancellor John Conant to recant publicly.<br>
<br>By mid-1659 Stubbe was conscripted by Sir Henry Vane into heavy political and religious pamphleteering. His first effort appeared in May, <span class="italic">The Common-Wealth of Israel</span>, a short critique of William Prynne's <span class="italic">The Re-publicans and other Spurious Good Old Cause &hellip; Anatomized</span>. The following month Stubbe published the first edition of <span class="italic">A Light Shining out of Darkness</span>, an incendiary attack on the presbyterians and the universities, a much augmented version of which appeared in November, and included a defence of the Quakers. In September Stubbe published <span class="italic">An Essay in Defence of the Good Old Cause</span>, which forcefully promoted Vane's limited vision of republicanism as well as controverted the authority of government over religious matters. To the treatise was appended <span class="italic">Malice Rebuked</span>, an intemperate assault on Richard Baxter, who had maligned Vane the previous year. (Stubbe had already attacked Baxter a couple of months earlier in <span class="italic">A Vindication of &hellip; Sir Henry Vane, from the Lies and Calumnies of Mr. Richard Baxter</span>.) In <span class="italic">An Essay in Defence of the Good Old Cause</span>, Stubbe, like Vane earlier, was quite flattering about Harrington's republican model despite disagreeing on the nature of citizenry in the political nation. Indeed, Stubbe &#145;was ready to cry out as if [<span class="italic">Oceana</span>] were the pattern in the mount&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1121). Yet following Harrington's critique of Vane's &eacute;litist vision of government Stubbe turned quite censorious. In mid-October he published <span class="italic">A Letter to an Officer of the Army Concerning a Select Senate</span> and, within days of the publication in January 1660 of Harrington's <span class="italic">Rota</span>, Stubbe produced his satirical <span class="italic">The Rota, or, News from the Common-Wealths-Mens Club</span>. Stubbe capped his campaign against Harrington two months later with <span class="italic">The Common-Wealth of Oceana Put into the Ballance, and Found too Light</span>.<br>
<br>Thus ended Stubbe's first foray into political pamphleteering. His considerable skills were fully appreciated, even feared, at the time, judging by Thomason's inscribing on his copy of <span class="italic">A Letter to an Officer of the Army</span> that the author was &#145;A dangerous fellow; Sir Henry Vanes Advisor&#146; and the complaint launched in parliament against him in February 1660 that it was Stubbe who had &#145;palliated in print Sir Henry Vane's wickedness&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.303). Quite possibly, however, Stubbe was carried away with his zeal. If one of Baxter's correspondents can be believed, certain of Vane's friends were far from pleased with Stubbe's &#145;Edge and Bitterness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 4.93). Certainly his political activity and anti-university writings&#151;not only <span class="italic">A Light Shining out of Darkness</span> but the biting raillery at the expense of the Oxford scientific club and certain members of Christ Church published in June 1659 in <span class="italic">Sundry Things from Several Hands Concerning the University of Oxford</span>&#151;provided ample ammunition to his enemies at Oxford. In late 1659 the presbyterian Edward Reynolds was reinstalled as dean of Christ Church and within four months managed to deprive Stubbe not only of his studentship at Christ Church, but of his sub-librarianship as well. Reynolds's own departure from Oxford shortly thereafter may have enabled Stubbe to remain at Christ Church but the Restoration visitors of the university ejected him in early August on the grounds that he was &#145;unduely brought in&#146; as a student as well as for the &#145;many complaints of his carryadge&#146;  (Varley, 17).<h2>
<a name="PhysicianandcriticoftheRoyalSociety"></a>Physician and critic of the Royal Society</h2>Stubbe now turned to practising medicine. Thanks to the recommendation of Sir Alexander Frazier, principal physician to Charles II, he obtained in early 1662 the office of king's physician to Jamaica and was granted &pound;200 for expenses. By then he had made his peace with the restored monarchy and church, having taken the oath of allegiance and having subscribed to the articles of the Church of England several months earlier. Prior to his departure Stubbe also presented the king with <span class="italic">The Indian Nectar, or, A Discourse Concerning Chocolata</span>, where his conformity was made public. The Caribbean climate did not agree with Stubbe, however, and he returned to England by autumn 1664. Having failed to obtain the position of physician for seamen in Yarmouth and adjacent ports Stubbe took up medical practice in and around Warwick, numbering Edward, Lord Conway, and his family at Ragley Hall among his patients. Such an association brought him in early 1666 to encounter Valentine Greatrakes, &#145;the Stroker&#146;, who demonstrated his highly publicized cures of scrofula at Ragley Hall and elsewhere in England. Stubbe's semi-naturalistic explanation of Greatrakes's powers, which was dedicated to Thomas Willis and addressed to Robert Boyle, was published later that year as <span class="italic">The Miraculous Conformist</span>.<br>
<br>In 1669 Stubbe launched a massive attack on the Royal Society. Already peeved at the underhanded treatment that (he believed) greeted the observations on Jamaica which he had sent the society, Stubbe was provoked by the vehemence with which Thomas Sprat's <span class="italic">History of the Royal Society</span> (1667) and, even more, Joseph Glanvill's <span class="italic">Plus ultra</span> (1668) advocated the cause of the nascent society. Not only did Stubbe believe that the protagonists' claims regarding the utility of science were vastly exaggerated, but he was convinced that their inflammatory rhetoric seriously threatened the humanist culture of the universities, the erudite foundations upon which protestantism rested, as well as the medical profession. And as he failed to effect privately the society's disavowal of Sprat's and Glanvill's writings Stubbe issued in rapid succession in 1670 four treatises&#151;<span class="italic">A Censure upon Certaine Passages Contained in the &#145;History of the Royall Society&#146;</span>; <span class="italic">The &#145;Plus Ultra&#146; Reduced to a Non-Plus</span>; <span class="italic">Legends no histories, or, A specimen of some animadversions upon the &#145;History of the Royal Society&#146;</span>; and <span class="italic">Campanella Revived, or, An Enquiry into the History of the Royal Society</span>&#151;all excoriating the aims and work of the society as well as the learning of its propagandists. Glanvill and other members of the society quickly responded, eliciting further rejoinders from Stubbe, who, in the meantime, had inadvertently become implicated in a controversy between the College of Physicians and the London apothecaries, and was attacked first by the physician Christopher Merrett and then the iatrochemist George Thompson. Stubbe responded in 1671 with <span class="italic">An Epistolary Discourse Concerning Phlebotomy</span> and <span class="italic">The Lord Bacons Relation of the Sweating-Sickness Examined</span>.<h2>
<a name="Finalpublicationsanddeath"></a>Final publications and death</h2>The controversy became increasingly abusive. Stubbe's passion soon alienated even those members of the Royal Society and the College of Physicians who were initially well disposed toward his campaign, and strong pressure was put on him to desist. Perhaps the impending Third Anglo-Dutch War contributed to such pressure as Stubbe's patron, Secretary of State Arlington, wished to conscript the gifted controversialist to bolster the English cause. Thus began Stubbe's second career of political pamphleteer. In June 1672 he published <span class="italic">A Justification of the Present War Against the United Netherlands</span>, to which he added early in 1673 <span class="italic">A Further Justification of the Present War Against the United Netherlands</span>. In addition, <span class="italic">Rosemary &amp; Bayes, or, Animadversions upon a Treatise called, &#145;The Rehearsall Trans-Prosed&#146;</span>, published the previous year&#151;and satirizing both Andrew Marvell's and Samuel Parker's position on ecclesiastical policy&#151;was another offshoot of his work on behalf of the government. A further contribution to the religious debate, &#145;An enquiry into the supremacy spiritual of the kings of England, occasioned by a proviso in the late act of parliament against conventicles&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 29/275/220), appears to have been refused publication. Stubbe was handsomely rewarded for his efforts. He was paid &pound;200 and, on 19 October 1673, was granted the reversion of the office of secretary of Jamaica. Ironically, eleven days later a warrant was issued for Stubbe's arrest, &#145;for seditious discourses and printing and publishing unlicensed papers&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 44/40, fol. 127). The reference was to his <span class="italic">Paris Gazette</span>, a broadside enumerating historical precedents for the annulment of marriages by proxy&#151;against the background of a portrait of James, duke of York&#151;which was published shortly after parliament convened on 20 October and hotly debated the marriage of James and Mary of Modena. Stubbe procured his release with another work of propaganda, a translation of Jacques Godefroy's <span class="italic">The History of the United Provinces of Achaia</span>, in which the ultimate destruction of Achaia was used to foretell the analogous fate of the Dutch.<br>
<br>Once again Stubbe resumed his medical practice. It was also then that he wrote <span class="italic">An Account of the Rise and Progress of Mahometanism</span>, which expanded upon Edward Pococke's tolerant and historicized view of Islam to include the prophet Muhammad as well. The work remained unpublished until the twentieth century, though it enjoyed a limited manuscript circulation. Late in the evening on 12 July 1676, while riding from Bath to Bristol to attend a patient, and &#145;his head being then intoxicated with bibbing, but more with talking, and snuffing of powder&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1082), Stubbe drowned in a shallow river 2 miles from Bath. He was buried two days later in St Peter's and St Paul's Church in Bath, with his old adversary Joseph Glanvill preaching an indifferent funeral sermon. The fate of his papers appears to have concerned the government, for his study was immediately sealed and the bishop of London was expected &#145;to appoint a person to inspect the papers for dangerous papers state and church&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1676&#150;7</i>, 310&#150;11). Anthony Wood, who knew Stubbe well, best characterized this truly erudite and enigmatic person:<blockquote>as he was so admirably well qualified with several sorts of learning and generous spirit, so he was very unhappy in this, that he was extream rash and imprudent, and wanted common discretion to manage his parts &hellip; Had he been endowed with common sobriety and discretion, and not have made himself and his learning mercenary and cheap to every ordinary and ignorant fellow, he would have been admired by all, and might have pick'd and chus'd his preferment. But all these things being wanting, he became a ridicule, and undervalued by sober and knowing scholars and others too. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1071&#150;2)</blockquote>
