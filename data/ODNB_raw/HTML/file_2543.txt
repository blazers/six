<span class="headword">Blackwell,  Thomas</span>  (1660?&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and college head</span>, was probably born in Glasgow, the son of a covenanting calenderer, Thomas Blackwell, and his wife, Janet Knox. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he apparently earned an MA in 1684. He was licensed to preach on 23 February 1693 and received a call to become a minister from the presbytery of Paisley on 5 April 1693, but his ordination was delayed until 28 August 1694. Blackwell took over the first charge in the Abbey parish, and it would seem that while he was in Paisley he married Christian Johnstoun (<i>d</i>. 1749), the daughter of the Glasgow physician John Johnstoun. The couple reputedly had twelve children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived into adulthood, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2544/', "Thomas Blackwell the younger (1701&#150;1757)")</script>, who also distinguished himself as principal of Marischal College and a leading Aberdonian man of letters, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2539/', "Alexander Blackwell (bap. 1709, d. 1747)")</script>, agricultural improver and government agent in Sweden.<br>
<br>Blackwell transferred to the second charge of St Nicholas Church, Aberdeen, on 9 October 1700, and gradually emerged as a prominent figure in the town. He was made a burgess and in 1716 became patron of Aberdeen's seven incorporated trades. In 1710 he made his mark on the republic of learning with the publication in Edinburgh of two related volumes: <span class="italic">Ratio sacra, or, An appeal unto the rational world, about the reasonableness of revealed religion</span> (dedicated to the lord provost and town council of Aberdeen) and <span class="italic">Schema sacrum, or, A Sacred Scheme of Natural and Revealed Religion</span> (dedicated to Sir Hugh Dalrymple, lord president of the court of session). In both works Blackwell sought to demonstrate the congruence of revealed religion with what he considered to be the genuine dictates of reason. Although his sense of the reasonableness of religion was very different from that of the English latitudinarians, he seems to have been receptive to the writings of Edward Stillingfleet, for in his attack on deism he invokes the refutation of Cartesianism and other heterodox philosophical systems added to later editions of Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Origines sacrae</span>. Given the deep religious divisions which then existed in Aberdeen and the north-east of Scotland, the <span class="italic">Ratio sacra</span> was a highly polemical work because Blackwell took aim not only at atheism and irreligion, but also at the Quakers, who were a significant local presence, and at the French mystic Madame Bourignon, whose tenets appealed to many episcopalians in the region.<br>
<br>Because of his staunch defence of presbyterianism Blackwell was appointed professor of divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and preacher at Grey Friars Church on 18 December 1711. Beginning in 1710 he also became increasingly involved in the affairs of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. In 1711 the moderator of the assembly, William Carstares, chose Blackwell and the Revd Robert Baillie of Inverness to accompany him to London in an attempt to stave off legislation which threatened to destroy presbyterian hegemony in Scotland. But to the delight of Scottish episcopalians, the lobbying of the trio failed to stop the tory ministry from pushing through the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Act of Patronage</span> in 1712. While in London, Blackwell additionally acted as an agent for the Aberdeen town council, and reported back on matters of political interest. He returned home in June or July 1712 following the publication in London of his tract on pulpit oratory, <span class="italic">Methodus evangelica</span>, which he had written as a respite from kirk affairs.<br>
<br>In the Jacobite rising which began in September 1715 Blackwell was the only member of the Marischal faculty who remained loyal to George I. He was duly rewarded by the royal commission of visitation appointed in 1717 to purge Marischal of residual Jacobitism; the commissioners retained Blackwell as professor of divinity, and he was confirmed as the new principal by the crown on 30 September 1717. He proved an effective manager of the college, although he provoked the opposition of some of his junior colleagues, and his continuing attacks on episcopalianism prompted a minor pamphlet war in 1722. Blackwell died in Aberdeen in February 1728.<br>
