<span class="headword">Pormort,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1592), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was born at Little Limber, Lincolnshire, the son of Gregory and Anne Pormort. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1575, when John Whitgift was master, but apparently left the university without proceeding to a degree. His decision to become a Roman Catholic priest may have resulted from the inspiring mission of Edmund Campion around England in 1580, for on 15 January 1581 Pormort arrived at the English College in Rheims. He soon left for the English College in Rome, where he was received on 8 May. In October 1582 he took the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, but by 1586 he had fallen out with the Jesuits, who directed studies at the college, refusing to sign a petition in their favour. He only made up the quarrel some years later.<br>
<br>Having been papally dispensed from the impediment of his early education in &#145;heresy&#146;, Pormort was ordained priest in August 1587. Shortly afterwards, on 6 March 1588, he left the English College, ostensibly for reasons of health, but more probably because of tensions with the Jesuits. At first he joined the household of Owen Lewis, bishop of Cassano, but by 23 April 1590 he was in Milan, where he became prefect of studies at the Swiss College. There he incurred the disfavour of the rector of the college, and by September was on his way to Lucerne, heading for England to serve as a missionary priest. November saw him pass through Rheims, and then Brussels (where he stayed briefly with the Jesuit Henry Walpole) and soon he crossed from Antwerp into England. Of course he entered the country under an alias, and revealed an unexpected sense of humour in adopting the name of John Whitgift, his former master at Trinity, by then archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>On arriving in England, Pormort stayed with the Jesuit Robert Southwell in London, repairing a friendship which he himself had broken off some time before (perhaps when he left the English College in Rome). Pormort was captured in August 1591, and after a short stay in the Bridewell was taken to the house of the infamous Topcliffe for torture. There Pormort's whimsical choice of alias backfired as Topcliffe, who harboured an intense hatred for the archbishop of Canterbury, offered him life and liberty in exchange for admitting that he was Whitgift's godson or even his bastard and that the archbishop had financed his studies beyond the seas. On 8 February 1592 Pormort was charged with having been ordained a Catholic priest abroad and of having converted a haberdasher, John Barwys, to the Roman Catholic church. During the proceedings Pormort informed the court not only of Topcliffe's proposed deal, but also about the bizarre sexual fantasies with which his tormentor had regaled him: fantasies which focused on the person of Queen Elizabeth, whose legs, breasts, and belly Topcliffe claimed to have frequently fondled. Pormort was condemned to death. On the day of his execution in St Paul's Churchyard, 20 February 1592, he was &#145;enforced to stand in his shirt almost two hours upon the ladder in Lent time upon a very cold day&#146;  (Pollen, 209) while Topcliffe ranted at him in a vain attempt to make him retract the accusations he had made in court. Pormort was hanged, drawn, and quartered. He was beatified on 22 November 1987.<br>
