<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douglas, Lady  Jane</span>  (1698&#150;1753), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the second child and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7896/', "James Douglas, second marquess of Douglas (c.1646&#150;1700)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1674, <i>d</i>. 1736), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15465/', "Robert Kerr, first marquess of Lothian")</script>, and his wife, Lady Jean Campbell. Jane was born on 17 March 1698; her father died when she was two, but her mother made sure that she was carefully educated. Slim, beautiful, intelligent, and devout, she was highly eligible and when she was twenty-two she almost married Francis, earl of Dalkeith, later second duke of Buccleuch. However, the duchess of Queensberry broke the match so that the earl could marry her own sister-in-law, another Jane Douglas. Jane fled to the continent where, the story goes, she planned to enter a nunnery, but was retrieved by her mother and brother. This seems unlikely for, by her own account, Jane had been brought up as a Presbyterian, but she certainly declined all subsequent suitors, though they included the dukes of Hamilton and Atholl, and the earls of Hopetoun, Aberdeen, and Panmure.<br>
<br>Living with her mother at Merchiston Castle, Edinburgh, Lady Jane Douglas initially enjoyed a good relationship with her difficult, eccentric brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7873/', "Archibald Douglas, third marquess and first duke of Douglas")</script>. He granted her an allowance and made her his sole executor. Having decided to remain a bachelor (though he was later to marry), he now began to urge his sister to find a husband and carry on the family line. When she met the handsome, dashing, but penniless Jacobite widower, Colonel John Steuart of Grandtully (1687&#150;1764), Jane encouraged him. The colonel courted her for two years until the day when she unaccountably refused to see him, returned all his love tokens and sent back his letters unopened. Steuart left the country to resume his continental military career and did not return for another ten years. By then, living on her own at Drumsheugh House since the death of her mother in 1736, Jane sent him a note, explaining that she had broken off their friendship because she had believed false rumours about him. He promptly called on her, they resumed their relationship, and they were married in August 1746 at Drumsheugh by the well-known episcopal minister Robert Keith. Jane's faithful serving-woman, Helen Hewat, was the only witness.<br>
<br>The marriage was kept secret because of the duke of Douglas's disapproval. A Hanoverian, he had turned against Colonel Steuart and had also quarrelled with Jane, perhaps after hearing how she had sheltered the Jacobite James, Chevalier de Johnstone, at Drumsheugh for two months after the battle of Culloden. The newly married couple left Scotland separately, Jane using the name Mrs Gray. Reunited at Huntingdon, they sailed from Harwich to the Low Countries and settled first at The Hague, later moving to Utrecht and then Aix-la-Chapelle. Not until the summer of 1748 did the very pregnant Jane reveal that she was Steuart's wife. The couple had by now run up such large debts that their friends advised them to escape their creditors by moving to Paris. This they did, Jane allegedly having to be lifted into the stagecoach by two men because she was so heavy.<br>
<br>After taking up residence at the H&ocirc;tel Ch&acirc;lons in the rue St Martin, Lady Jane gave birth to non-identical twin sons on 10 July 1748, or so she claimed. Many people were incredulous, for she was fifty years old. Such late births were not unknown, but her enemies soon began to circulate the rumour that became the centre of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> fifteen years later. Jane had never been pregnant, people said. She and Steuart had obtained two French babies which they passed off as their own, in the hope of securing the duke of Douglas's inheritance. The voluminous papers in the complex court case known as the Douglas cause record these accusations and the very different evidence provided by Helen Hewat and Jane's other servants and friends. According to them, Sholto Thomas, the younger child, was very delicate, and had been baptized immediately after birth by Pierre la Marr, the man-midwife who delivered him. When Jane and the colonel decided to return to Rheims they took the older twin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7874/', "Archibald James Edward Douglas (formerly Steuart)")</script>, with them but left Sholto with a wet-nurse, fearing that he would not survive the journey.<br>
<br>Four weeks after Archibald's public baptism in Rheims, Lady Jane found that she was pregnant again, but she miscarried at three months. Meanwhile Sholto was thriving in the care of his wet-nurse, and in November 1749 his parents travelled to Paris to collect him. They had resolved to return to Britain in the hope of improving their financial situation, more desperate than ever since the duke had cut off Jane's allowance on hearing the rumours about the twins. When Jane appealed to George II for financial assistance, writing pathetically, &#145;Presumptive heiress of a great estate and family, with two children, I want bread&#146;  (Fraser, <span class="italic">Douglas Book</span>, 2.498), he granted her an annual pension of &pound;300, the equivalent of her brother's allowance. Meanwhile Steuart had been incarcerated in the king's bench prison at the instigation of his creditors.<br>
<br>Sending affectionate messages to her husband almost every day, Lady Jane decided to take her sons to Scotland to see the duke. He, however, declined to answer her letters and, when she and the twins arrived at Douglas Castle in April 1753, they were turned away. &#145;The children, poor babies, have never yet done any fault&#146;, Jane protested. &#145;May I not then plead for their being admitted and allowed to see you and to kiss your hands?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 125). The duke ignored her pleas. Anxious about her husband, Jane set off for London a few days later, leaving the twins with her law agent. Two days after she left, Sholto fell ill, and on 5 May he died. Jane was inconsolable. She wrote to her brother to give him the news. Still he did not reply.<br>
<br>Now seriously ill herself, with violent pains in her stomach, Lady Jane travelled back to Edinburgh that August and tried once more to see the duke. It was no use. Weak and emaciated, she died in her Edinburgh lodgings at noon on 21 November 1753 and was buried five days later in her mother's grave in the Chapel Royal at Holyrood. With her brother's death in 1761, the scandal surrounding the birth of the twins was revived, as Archibald's claim to the Douglas estates was contested on behalf of the duke's kinsman James-George, seventh duke of Hamilton. Years of legal debate followed, with both sides sending investigators to Paris to try to discover what had really happened there in the summer of 1748. Finally, the House of Lords decided in favour of Archibald, and Lady Jane Douglas was publicly vindicated.<br>
