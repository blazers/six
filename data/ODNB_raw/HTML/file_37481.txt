<span class="headword">Greathead,  James Henry</span>  (1844&#150;1896), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Grahamstown, Cape Colony, on 6 August 1844, the son of James Henry Greathead of Grahamstown, a member of the legislative council of Cape Colony 1859&#150;60. He was educated at St Andrew's College, Grahamstown. He went to England in 1859 to complete his education at Westbourne Collegiate School, London.<br>
<br>In 1864 Greathead began a three-year pupillage with P. W. Barlow, followed by a year on the construction of the Midland Railway extension from Bedford to London, under W. H. Barlow and C. B. Baker. At about this time Peter Barlow was promoting the idea of a network of underground railways as the solution to London's street-traffic problems. It was agreed that a pedestrian tunnel, the Tower subway, should be driven under the Thames &#145;as a sample of the system&#146;, but the memory of the extreme difficulties of Isambard K. Brunel in completing the Thames Tunnel resulted in none of the contractors approached by Barlow being willing to tender for the work. In 1868, however, Greathead made an offer to build the tunnel for the sum of &pound;9400 and Barlow accepted. Work began the following year, using a shield which, though similar to one patented by Barlow in 1868, was designed by Greathead; it was forced forward by powerful screw-jacks as excavation proceeded, and the 1350 ft long tunnel was completed in less than a year.<br>
<br>Greathead set up his own practice as a consulting engineer in 1870 and continued to devise improvements to his tunnelling shield while being employed mainly on surface railway schemes. In 1886, however, work began on the long-delayed City and Southwark subway, the beginning of a line that became the City and South London Railway, the world's first underground electric railway. For the excavation of the twin tunnels through water-bearing strata, compressed air had to be used in conjunction with a much-improved design of the Greathead shield, which enabled the first of the tunnels under the Thames to be completed in only fifteen weeks.<br>
<br>Greathead was involved in the early 1890s with several other deep tunnel railway schemes, including the Blackwall Tunnel under the Thames, and as a complete contrast he was also associated with Sir Douglas Fox in the construction of the Liverpool overhead electric railway, opened in 1893. He was much sought after as an expert witness in arbitrations and parliamentary inquiries, where his engineering expertise and powers of logical exposition carried much weight.<br>
<br>Greathead was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1879, and the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1881, serving as a member of the council of the latter in 1894. He retained close connections with South Africa as consulting engineer to the Durban tramways.<br>
<br>In 1884 Greathead married Blanche Emily Caldecott, daughter of Selby Coryndon of Kimberley. They had one son and two daughters. He died suddenly at his house, Ravenscraig, Leigham Court Road, Streatham, on 21 October 1896. He was survived by his wife. The many underground railway schemes on which he was engaged at the time of his death had to be completed by others, but the Greathead shield was his lasting memorial.<br>
