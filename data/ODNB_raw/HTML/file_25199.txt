<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shakespear, Sir  Richmond Campbell</span>  (1812&#150;1861), <span class="occ">army and political officer in India</span>, youngest son of John Talbot Shakespear, of the Bengal civil service, and Emily (eldest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Amelia Richmond Webb), was born in India on 11 May 1812, and baptized at Krishnagar on 13 April 1813. He came to England with his first cousin, William Makepeace Thackeray, and was with him at a preparatory school&#151;ruled, according to Thackeray, &#145;by a horrible little tyrant&#146;&#151;and at Charterhouse. After attending Addiscombe College (1827&#150;8) he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bengal artillery on 12 June 1828. He arrived in India on 10 February 1829 and served at various stations in Bengal until 19 January 1837, when he was appointed assistant in the revenue department and stationed at Gorakhpur.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1838 he joined at Delhi the 6th light field (camel) battery of nine-pounders under Captain Augustus Abbott, and, leaving Delhi on 4 November, marched in the army of the Indus under Major-General Sir Willoughby Cotton and Lieutenant-General Sir John Keane, to Kandahar, arriving in April 1839. He took part in the expedition to Girishk under Sir Robert Sale, returning to Kandahar on 29 May. Like other British officers, he distrusted Shah Shuja.<br>
<br>On 21 June, Shakespear was appointed political assistant in the mission to Herat of Major d'Arcy Todd, the newly appointed envoy to Shah Kamran. Shakespear's special duty was to train the troops at Herat in gunnery and drill. Towards the end of 1839 a Russian expedition under General Perovsky left Orenburg for Khiva; fearing Russian penetration in central Asia, Todd sent Captain James Abbott to persuade the khan of Khiva to release Russian captives sold into slavery, thereby depriving Perovsky of his <i>casus belli</i>. Abbott was unsuccessful in his mission but appalling winter weather conditions compelled Perovsky to abandon his march to Khiva.<br>
<br>Todd, without news from Abbott, dispatched Shakespear to Khiva on a similar mission. With an escort of eleven picked Heratis he left Herat on 14 May 1840, covering the 433 miles to Khiva by horse and camel by 12 June. He negotiated with the khan of Khiva, and meanwhile proposed to his own superiors a <i>de facto</i> British protectorate over Khiva, supporting it by officers and money. Exceeding his instructions and offering the khan a future alliance with Britain, Shakespear persuaded the khan to release the Russian slaves into his care&#151;416 in all, including 18 women and 11 children. With a Khivan escort, Shakespear led them across the desert to Fort Aleksandrovsk on the Caspian and thence to Orenburg on 1 October, where he was received with acclamation. Having delivered his charges he travelled to St Petersburg, arriving on 3 November 1840. He was f&ecirc;ted and was cordially received by the tsar. From St Petersburg, Shakespear carried dispatches to London. On 31 August 1841 he was knighted. He published &#145;A journey from Herat to Orenburg&#146; in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> (June 1846).<br>
<br>Shakespear returned to India in 1841. On 3 January 1842 he was appointed military secretary to Major-General George Pollock, commanding the force assembled at Peshawar for the relief of Sir Robert Sale at Jalalabad. He reached Peshawar on 5 February and remained there for two months while the column was organized and reinforcements were brought up. On 31 March he accompanied Pollock to Jamrud, and on 5 April entered the Khyber Pass. He volunteered to accompany Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor as his aide-de-camp in his attack on the heights on the right, and took command of the men who had recently formed the garrison of Ali Masjid, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. He again distinguished himself at Mamu Khel on 24 August, at Jagdalak on 8 September, and at Tezin on 12 and 13 September, and was again mentioned in dispatches. On arrival at Kabul on 15 September he volunteered to accompany 600 Kuzzilbash horsemen to rescue the British captives held by the Afghans at Bamian. The captives, by the exertions of Eldred Pottinger and by liberal bribery, had already effected their own release, but Shakespear, meeting them on 17 September at the foot of the Kalu Pass, escorted them through the disturbed country until, on 20 September, they met Sale's troops. Shakespear arrived at Kabul with the captives on 22 September. In October and November he accompanied Pollock on his return march to India, crossing the Sutlej at Ferozepore on 19 December.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1843 Shakespear was appointed deputy commissioner of Saugor. He was promoted brevet captain on 12 June. In October he was transferred to Gwalior as assistant to Lieutenant-Colonel Sleeman, political agent in Sindhia's dominions, and took part in the war against the Maratha forces, which was considered necessary to establish the government at Gwalior on a firm foundation. He was aide-de-camp to Sir Hugh Gough at the battle of Maharajpur on 29 December 1843. After this he was employed in getting possession of Gwalior Fort and in disbanding the durbar troops. On return to civil duties he remained in political charge of Gwalior until June 1848. During his service at Gwalior, Shakespear married (at Agra), on 5 March 1844, Marion Sophia, third daughter of George Powney Thompson of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Harriet. Lady Shakespear, three sons, and six daughters survived Shakespear, and she died at Bournemouth on 16 December 1899. On 1 May 1846 he was promoted to be regimental captain.<br>
<br>In 1848 sickness compelled Shakespear to go to the hills on leave; but on the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War he returned to military duty on 20 October. Joining at Ferozepore the army of the Punjab under Sir Hugh Gough, he was present at the action of Ramnagar on 22 November. On 1 December he was promoted to brevet major. On 3 December he was in the action of Sadulapur or passage of the Chenab, and on 13 January 1849 he commanded his battery of six heavy guns at the battle of Chilianwala and was mentioned in dispatches. At the battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849 Shakespear again commanded his heavy-gun battery. The battle opened with a three hours' bombardment by the British at a range of 1500 yards and at the rate of forty rounds per gun per hour. After this the artillery advanced with exceptional speed, taking up forward positions and steadily driving the enemy back. Shakespear was wounded and was invalided to the hills. He was thanked in dispatches, and on 7 June he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Shakespear returned to civil employment at Gwalior towards the end of 1849. In 1851 he was transferred to the political agency at Jodhpur. He was gazetted to be resident in Nepal in 1853, but did not take this up as the post did not become vacant. He was promoted to brevet colonel in the army on 28 November 1854. In 1857 he was appointed resident at Baroda, and, in February 1858, political commissioner of the district, and received acting command of the northern division of the Bombay army, in addition to his political duties, with the rank of brigadier-general. He was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel on 27 August 1858.<br>
<br>In July 1859 Shakespear became agent to the governor-general for central India, residing at Indore. He conducted that year negotiations with the begums of Bhopal and installed Sikandar Begam as rani of Bhopal. For his tact in extricating the government from an embarrassing position he was commended by the governor-general in council. He was made CB, civil division, in 1860, and later in the same year (30 December) Lord Canning, in a dispatch to the home government, expressed his high appreciation of Shakespear's conduct of the negotiations with Sindhia. Shakespear had accepted the post of chief commissioner of Mysore and Coorg, and was preparing to take up the appointment when he died of bronchitis on 29 October 1861 at Indore, and was buried at the old cemetery there.<br>
