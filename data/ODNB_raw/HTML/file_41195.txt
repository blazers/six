<span class="headword">Cheyne, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1414), <span class="occ">diplomat, heretic, and speaker-elect of the House of Commons</span>, of unknown parentage, was a scion of the family of Cheyne of Drayton Beauchamp, Buckinghamshire. Almost certainly a younger son, he was probably intended for a career in the church. Capgrave says that he took minor orders, and later in orthodox ecclesiastical circles he was regarded as a renegade. In 1372 or 1373 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1380), daughter of William, Lord Deincourt, and widow of Robert, Lord Tiptoft (<i>d</i>. 1372); the match transformed his prospects. Not only did he gain access to wealth, for his wife brought with her dower lands valued at 230 marks a year; he also gained connections. Probably as a result of these, he became an esquire in the king's household by 1374, and about 1378 he was knighted. At the court he became associated with the so-called <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50540/', "Lollard knights")</script>, and it is clear that he was himself of Lollard opinion. Possibly he was attracted to the heretics' beliefs by their call for monastic disendowment. He was the recipient of many grants of the confiscated dependencies of French abbeys, among them the priory of Beckford, Gloucestershire, which was to be his chief seat.<br>
<br>Cheyne was employed by the crown on a number of diplomatic missions. In 1380 he was sent on an embassy to Brittany, and in the following year he visited Wenceslas, king of the Romans, whose sister, Anne, Richard II was shortly to marry. By the late 1390s, however, his relationship with Richard was clouded by his growing association with the king's foremost opponent, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, for whom he deputized in the court of chivalry. When Gloucester and his allies were arrested in 1397 he was himself detained, and condemned to be hanged and drawn for treason. On the initiative of the Lords, however, he was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. It is not clear when he was released. In September 1399 he was elected for Gloucestershire to the parliament summoned to witness Richard's deposition. According to Walsingham, Cheyne was chosen speaker of the assembly on 6 October, but on the following day Archbishop Arundel, addressing convocation, alluded to the anti-clericalism of many of the parliamentary knights and especially to the dangerous views of Cheyne himself. On the 15th Cheyne abandoned the speaker's office. The evidence suggests that he was responding to the pressure exerted by the archbishop. However, the reason publicly given was the physical weakness caused by his long spell of imprisonment.<br>
<br>However unsatisfactory his relations may have been with Arundel, Cheyne was highly valued by Henry IV, who often employed him in diplomacy. In 1401 he was involved in negotiations for the marriage of Henry's elder daughter, Blanche, to the son and heir of Ruprecht III of Bavaria, and in 1404 he made two embassies to Paris to seek an improvement in relations between Henry's government and the French. He was also active in the domestic field. From mid-June 1400 he was for six years a member of Henry IV's council, and his duties involved him in organizing the defences of the southern Welsh marches against the attacks of Owain Glyn D&#373;r. In May 1405 he acted as intermediary between the council and the treasurers of war regarding payment of soldiers' wages, and three months later he was arranging for the submission of Welsh rebels. At the Coventry parliament of 1404, in which the Commons pressed for confiscation of the temporalities of the church to assist royal finances, it was Cheyne, probably attending as a councillor, who acted as &#145;prolocutor militum&#146;, even though Sir William Sturmy was the official speaker  (Roskell, 87&#150;8). His speech provoked another attack from Archbishop Arundel, who condemned his and the knights' selfish motives.<br>
<br>In November 1406 Cheyne undertook a two-year mission to Rome to seek an end to the schism. He undertook further embassies to France in 1410 and 1411. He appears to have died in early 1414. His will, made on 1 November 1413, had all the characteristics of a Lollard testament&#151;an extravagant emphasis on personal unworthiness, request for burial outside the church, and prohibition of funerary pomp. All the same, his radical sympathies did not prevent Henry Chichele, bishop of St David's and later archbishop of Canterbury, a companion on many embassies, from acting as one of his overseers. He was buried in the chapel in Beckford churchyard. His heir was a Sir John Cheyne, who died in June 1420. His second wife, Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Edward Lovetot of Southoe, Huntingdonshire, survived him. She subsequently married William Herle, esquire.<br>
