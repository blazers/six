<span class="headword">Collins,  (Lewis) John</span>  (1905&#150;1982), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and social reformer</span>, was born on 23 March 1905 at Hawkhurst, Kent, the youngest of the four children (two daughters and two sons) of Arthur Collins, master builder, and his wife, Hannah Priscilla Edwards. He was brought up in a conservative, churchgoing home and at the age of six he felt called to the church's ordained ministry. This was reinforced during his time at Cranbrook School, and also at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he went as a scholar. He obtained a third class in part one of the mathematical tripos (1925), and a second in part one (1927) and a first in part two (1928) of the theological tripos. He was ordained in Canterbury Cathedral in 1928 and became curate of Whitstable (1928&#150;9).<br>
<br>Within a year, however, he was invited to return to Cambridge as chaplain of his old college, where he remained until 1931. During this time he became interested in the work of Albert Loisy, a French Roman Catholic scholar who had been excommunicated because of his liberal interpretation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The two men became friends and Collins began to question various elements in his own faith, as well as his conservative approach to politics and the ordering of society. In 1931 he became an assistant lecturer in theology at King's College, London, and minor canon of St Paul's, but three years later returned to Cambridge as vice-principal of Westcott House (1934&#150;7). Soon after his appointment in 1938 as dean of Oriel College, Oxford, he joined the Labour Party, having noted the effects of the 1930s economic depression on the working class. On 21 October 1939, at St Peter's, Stutton, Suffolk, he married Diana Clavering Elliot [<i>see below</i>], a gifted and dynamic woman who shared fully in every aspect of his work and was appointed DBE in 1999. They had four sons.<br>
<br>In 1940 Collins left Oxford in order to become a chaplain in the Royal Air Force. For most of the war he was at a training station in Wiltshire, where he conceived the idea of forming a fellowship of Christian airmen and airwomen who would meet regularly to study their faith and its practical implications. This experiment aroused considerable interest, though his choice of socialist speakers and his frequent challenges to authority brought him into serious conflict with his senior officers.<br>
<br>When the war ended Collins resumed his post at Oxford and in December 1946 convened a meeting in Oxford town hall which was addressed by several prominent speakers, all of whom urged a large audience to take their religious convictions into the social and political life of the nation. As a result of this meeting Christian Action came into being, and in 1948 the prime minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Collins to a canonry at St Paul's so that he might devote more time to the new movement and provide it with a London headquarters.<br>
<br>Before long Collins had become a national figure and for the next three decades was one of the world's leading Christian protagonists of action in the causes of justice, freedom, and peace. Christian Action itself never had a very large membership but it provided an organization to support his own highly controversial personal work and its influence was quite out of proportion to its size. In home affairs it gave strong support to a successful campaign for the abolition of capital punishment and undertook pioneering work among the homeless and persons displaced by war. But the emphasis was soon to change. In 1956, after Collins had visited South Africa, over &pound;20,000 was raised on behalf of some 156 opponents of apartheid who had been arrested and imprisoned in Johannesburg. This was intended to pay for their legal defence and to provide support for their families. Two years later a separate organization known as the International Defence and Aid Fund was set up, with Collins as president and director, and this soon became an important instrument of British, and later international, opposition to apartheid. His work in this field was recognized in 1978 by the award of the gold medal of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid.<br>
<br>The explosion of the first nuclear bomb at Hiroshima in 1945 disturbed Collins greatly and during the early part of 1958 he was one of the sponsors of the national Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), with the philosopher Bertrand Russell as its president and Collins as its chairman. The main public manifestation of the campaign's activities was a series of Easter marches to and from the nuclear research establishment at Aldermaston. The numbers taking part ranged from 7,000 to 20,000. Soon, however, there were serious disagreements. A breakaway committee of 100 was formed in 1960 to organize civil disobedience. This caused dissension, indiscipline, and violence in CND and Collins resigned from the chairmanship.<br>
<br>Collins continued to serve as a canon of St Paul's, where he held, successively, the offices of chancellor (from 1948), precentor (from 1953), and treasurer (from 1970). The cathedral pulpit was used by him to promote Christian Action causes and, although he did not himself attract large congregations, his controversial sermons received wide publicity. Collins would have been a disturbing member of any cathedral chapter, but he had a great affection for St Paul's and never lost his vision of this national cathedral as a centre of culture and of Christian faith and witness. It was therefore a great blow to him when, on the retirement of W. R. Matthews from the deanery in 1967, he was not chosen as his successor. He remained at St Paul's until his seventy-sixth birthday and after a brief retirement died in a London hospital on 31 December 1982. At the end of his life the British churches were more deeply aware than ever before of their social and political responsibilities, and the man who symbolized this change and helped to bring it about was John Collins of St Paul's. There is a memorial stone to him in the crypt of the cathedral he served for a total of thirty-six years.<br>
<br>Collins's wife, <a name="cosubject_89966"></a><span class="headword">Dame Diana Clavering Collins <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elliot]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">campaigner and writer</span>, was born on 13 August 1917 at Stutton Hall, Stutton, near Capel St Mary, Suffolk, the daughter of Jan Frederick Lettsom Elliot, a landowner and businessman then serving as a captain in the 4th Suffolk regiment, and his wife, Florence Elizabeth Vere, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fison. She was educated at Bedgebury Park School and attended a finishing school in Paris before being presented at court in the presence of King Edward VIII (whom she remembered as looking sad as well as bored). At Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, she read English and won a lacrosse blue, but left without taking a degree. Following her marriage she was closely involved in all the campaigns her husband was associated with. She initially ran the office of Christian Action, in 1957 chaired and spoke at the meeting in Trafalgar Square which led to the formation of CND, and wrote much of the early campaign literature as well as organizing the office of the International Defence and Aid Fund. At one point she travelled incognito to South Africa to meet with leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. Following her husband's death she wrote <span class="italic">Time and the Priestleys</span> (1994), a memoir of J. B. Priestley and his wife, Jacquetta Hawkes (she had given the address at Priestley's memorial service in Westminster Abbey), and <span class="italic">Partners in Protest</span> (1992), an account of her own marriage. She was also active in the Movement for the Ordination of Women. When she was appointed DBE in 1999, in recognition of her work for the anti-apartheid movement, she commented that this was because at her age she was no longer regarded as any threat. She died on 23 May 2003 at Colchester General Hospital, near her home in Nayland, Suffolk. She was survived by three of her four sons, Andrew, Peter, and Mark, another son, Richard, having died in a road accident.<br>
