<span class="headword">Legge,  (Mary) Dominica</span>  (1905&#150;1986), <span class="occ">French scholar and historian</span>, was born on Sunday 26 March 1905, whence the name Dominica by which she chose to be known, at 38 Leinster Gardens, Bayswater, London, the second daughter of James Granville Legge (1861&#150;1940), inspector of reformatory schools, later director of education in Liverpool, and his wife, Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Makins (<i>d</i>. 1957). Her grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16354/', "James Legge")</script> was a missionary in China before becoming the first professor of Chinese at the University of Oxford. She had three siblings, one of them the conductor Henry James Granville (Harry) Legge (1914&#150;2000).<br>
<br>Dominica Legge was educated at Liverpool College, Huyton, and Somerville College, Oxford, where she graduated with a second-class degree in French in 1926, having specialized in medieval French, and particularly in Anglo-Norman under the guidance of M. K. (Mildred) Pope. Anglo-Norman, more precisely the cultural and social relationships of continental and insular French from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, became the focus of the immense and influential research effort that occupied the rest of her life. She was awarded the degree of BLitt in 1928 for her thesis on the <span class="italic">Lumiere as lais</span> of Pierre de Peckham, and (after serving as an editor for the Selden Society from 1928 to 1934) was appointed Mary Somerville research fellow in 1935, a position that enabled her to complete work on the edition of <span class="italic">Anglo-Norman Letters and Petitions from All Souls MS 182</span>, begun in collaboration with Maud V. Rose; the edition was published in 1941 by the Anglo-Norman Text Society, which Legge had helped to found in 1937. She was appointed assistant lecturer in French at Royal Holloway College, University of London, in 1938, assistant lecturer in French at University College, Dundee, in 1942, and lecturer in French at the University of Edinburgh in 1943, where she was promoted reader (1953) and professor, with a personal chair of French (Anglo-Norman studies), in 1968.<br>
<br>A mark of Legge's stature as a scholar even early in her career is the distinction of those who chose her as a collaborator: Sir William Holdsworth for the edition of the <span class="italic">Year Book of 10 Edward II</span> (1934) and Eugene Vinaver for the edition of <span class="italic">Le Roman de Balain</span> (1942). However, it was her two monographs on Anglo-Norman culture, <span class="italic">Anglo-Norman in the Cloisters</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">Anglo-Norman Literature and its Background</span> (1963), that unequivocally established her reputation as the leading scholar in Anglo-Norman studies, while also consolidating the particular place of Anglo-Norman within French studies, becoming, according to A. H. Diverres, &#145;the standard guides to the field&#146;. She was made a DLitt by the University of Oxford (1965) and an honorary fellow of Somerville College (1968) in recognition of her published research. The corpus of this is remarkable, running to seventy-two items between 1928 and 1986, excluding book reviews. Remarkable also is its range. A historian as much as a philologist and literary scholar, Legge put the patronage of texts and their social and historico-cultural context at the heart of her research, and actively promoted the notion that many works of medieval French literature, especially insular ones, were commissioned to mark notable events in the lives of patrons. Although this idea, like the sub-genre of the &#145;ancestral romance&#146;, which she championed, was later questioned, it remained a valuable concept in research.<br>
<br>Legge's credentials as a historian saw her elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society (1942) and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1958). For the value of her general scholarly work she was elected corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of America (1971) and fellow of the British Academy (1974). In 1971 the French government appointed her an officer of the Ordre des Palmes Acad&eacute;miques. On her retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1973 she was granted the title of professor emerita.<br>
<br>Legge was known for the trenchant and pithy expression of her views, especially on declining standards, remarking with dismay that &#145;students don't read Bacon any more&#146;, and commenting that the university's librarians &#145;in their ignorance catalogued Mill, <span class="italic">On Liberty</span> alongside <span class="italic">Mill on the Floss</span>&#146;  (private information). In reality, however, she was extremely generous and supportive to students and young colleagues, who would regularly be invited to her small flat at 204 Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh, the walls of which were covered with pictures mostly of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artists, including George du Maurier and J. B. Yeats; there they would be offered tea or coffee and warned to be careful with the cups because &#145;Oscar Wilde drank from them&#146;  (ibid.). She also regularly took students on historical and archaeological expeditions.<br>
<br>In retirement Legge (who never married) lived at 191A Woodstock Road, Oxford. She continued to be very active in attending conferences and undertaking research, and working on her revision of Paul Meyer's edition of <span class="italic">La vie de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> for the Anglo-Norman Text Society. However, she suffered from cataracts and from problems with her knees, which hindered her efforts towards the end of her life. An operation for cataracts improved her sight temporarily, but an accident damaged an eye and negated its effects. A further fall required hospital treatment, after which she entered St Luke's Nursing Home in Latimer Road, Oxford. She died there of a pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis on 10 December 1986.<br>
