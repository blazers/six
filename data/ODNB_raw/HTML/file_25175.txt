<span class="headword">Seymour <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Seymour Conway]</span>, Lord  Hugh</span>  (1759&#150;1801), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 29 April 1759 in London, fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6121/', "Francis Seymour Conway, first marquess of Hertford (1718&#150;1794)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fitzroy (1726&#150;1782), daughter of the duke of Grafton. He used the surname Seymour Conway until his father's death in 1794. He was educated at Bracken's academy, Greenwich, in the late 1760s and appears to have entered the navy as captain's servant in the yacht <i>William and Mary</i> on 1 April 1770. He was discharged from her on 31 March 1771, and from 21 April he served for over two years as midshipman in the <i>Pearl</i>, commanded by a relation, Captain John Leveson Gower. After spending time on various other ships he joined the <i>Alarm</i> on 18 March 1774, and apart from a short spell in the <i>Trident</i> served in her until he passed for lieutenant on 11 July 1776; thereupon he was made lieutenant in the same ship, a position he held until 18 June 1778 when he was appointed commander to the xebec <i>Minorca</i> in the Mediterranean. He was promoted captain on 8 February 1779 to the <i>Porcupine</i>, and then successively to the <i>Diana</i>, <i>Ambuscade</i>, and <i>Latona</i>, mostly in the channel, though the <i>Latona</i> was with Richard Howe's fleet at the relief of Gibraltar.<br>
<br>After the peace Seymour Conway with his younger brother George and John Willett Payne took a house in Conduit Street, London where, leading an irregular and convivial life, he became intimate with the prince of Wales. From this fate he was in great measure rescued by his marriage on 3 April 1785 to Lady Anne Horatia Waldegrave (<i>d</i>. 1801), daughter of the duchess of Gloucester by her first marriage, to James Waldegrave, second Earl Waldegrave, though he remained on friendly terms with the prince. During the Spanish armament of 1790 he commanded the <i>Canada</i>, and while in her received an accidental blow on the head from the lead, as soundings were being taken, so for a time had to live quietly in the country. By February 1793 he was able to resume active service, and was appointed to the <i>Leviathan</i>, in which he accompanied Lord Hood to the Mediterranean. After the occupation of Toulon he was sent home with dispatches, but he returned at once and resumed command of the <i>Leviathan</i>, which was shortly afterwards sent home to join the fleet under Lord Howe. He had thus a distinguished part in the actions of 28 and 29 May and 1 June 1794.<br>
<br>Early in 1795 Seymour was moved into the <i>Sanspareil</i>, and on his promotion to flag rank (1 June 1795) he hoisted his flag on the same ship, in which he took part in the battle off Lorient on 23 June. On 7 March 1795 he was appointed a lord of the Admiralty, and he remained so until 10 September 1798. Although at sea much of the time, there is evidence that he did take some share in the board's work, particularly during the winter. On 14 February 1799 he became a vice-admiral, and he commanded a detached squadron off Brest that summer. He was appointed commander-in-chief at Jamaica on 9 May 1800 and arrived there in August. His command was uneventful, but he was attacked by yellow fever; he went to sea for his health in the <i>Tisiphone</i>, but worsened and died at sea off Jamaica on 11 September 1801. His body was sent home in the schooner <i>Sting</i>, his wife having died at Clifton, Bristol, shortly before. His loss was much regretted, and he was described even by Lord St Vincent as &#145;an excellent officer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 2453). It is clear that Seymour went to sea from choice and he is said to have been responsible for an improved method of fitting topmasts and for the addition of epaulettes to officers' uniforms  (Dillon). He was among the most handsome men of his day, standing over 6 feet tall, had great presence, and was courteous to all. In his will he left most of his money to his wife and then to his children, of whom there were seven: four daughters and three sons; the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25170/', "Sir George Seymour")</script>, followed him into the navy. He owned a farm at Hambledon, Hampshire, and an estate at Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, and his father left him an estate on the island of St John.<br>
