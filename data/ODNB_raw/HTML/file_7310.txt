<span class="headword">Davy,  David Elisha</span>  (1769&#150;1851), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 16 June 1769, son of David Davy (1709&#150;1799), farmer of Rumburgh, near Bungay, Suffolk, and his second wife, Susanna Foyster (<i>c</i>.1743&#150;1800). His uncle Eleazar Davy, of The Grove, Yoxford, high sheriff of Suffolk in 1770, who had no son, educated him to be his heir. After boarding at Bungay grammar school under Thomas Reeve, Davy was sent to Samuel Forster's school at Yoxford about 1782, then moved with him to Norwich when Forster succeeded Samuel Parr at the grammar school there in 1785. From Pembroke College, Cambridge, he matriculated in 1786 and graduated as sixth senior optime in 1790; two years later he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Norwich. He served curacies at Theberton and Yoxford, but abandoned clerical duties in June 1795 on becoming receiver-general of transferred duties for east Suffolk on Sir John Rous's application to Pitt (Rous, later first earl of Stradbroke, had married Eleazar Davy's stepdaughter). When Eleazar Davy died in 1803, David Elisha had to borrow from Gurney's Bank to pay his uncle's debts and legacies without selling property at a time when land values had slumped. Established at The Grove as a magistrate and deputy lieutenant, he took command of the Blything Hundred Volunteers with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; his friend Henry Jermyn of Sibton (1767&#150;1820) was second in command.<br>
<br>With Jermyn in 1805 Davy began his life's work of gathering materials for a history of Suffolk. They toured together, and in 1810 jointly issued to incumbents a questionnaire as Francis Blomefield did in Norfolk in the 1730s. When in 1820 Jermyn died, Davy feared that his friend's notes might go to a publisher, for each had copied from the other, and Davy still had publication in mind. With mounting debts, he had no alternative but to put The Grove into Gurney's hands, and he resigned his receivership, and retired to a friend's house at Ufford, near Woodbridge. Antiquities now filled his time, and the tours continued, usually with the Revd John Wareyn Darby as companion: his journal records excursions made between 1823 and 1844. With a small circle of like-minded friends including George Bitton Jermyn (Henry's nephew), John Mitford, and Joseph Hunter, he was a regular correspondent, always generous to serious enquirers, but some letters betray the bitterness he felt at having lost the position in society which his uncle intended. He was reluctant to join the many societies that would have welcomed him. He borrowed and transcribed such collections as those of Hervy, Blois, Candler, Martin, and Cullum, but Craven Ord made a cautious response when asked for help, and Davy long mistook this for a rebuff. Eventually he came to realize that publication was less desirable than the amassing of well-ordered collected materials, and his 131 manuscript volumes, mostly folios, are more useful than any printed history.<br>
<br>Davy was the anonymous author of several Suffolk works, and revised Frederic Shoberl's <span class="italic">Beauties of England and Wales</span> volume for Grieg and Higham's <span class="italic">Excursions</span> in 1818. He admitted to providing the text for John Sell Cotman's <span class="italic">Suffolk Brasses</span> (1819), the etchings of which were made from Davy's own rubbings, and for Henry Davy's <span class="italic">Beccles Church and other Suffolk Antiquities</span> (1818), <span class="italic">Architectural Antiquities of Suffolk</span> (1827), and <span class="italic">Views of the Seats of the Noblemen and Gentlemen in Suffolk</span> (1827), as well as writing thirty-five articles in <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> over D.A.Y., the terminals of his names. Carlyle and Edward FitzGerald called him &#145;Dryasdust&#146;, but Davy knew that his collections were invaluable and irreplaceable to those who would later study Suffolk. He died unmarried and intestate at Ufford on 15 August 1851 (having recently recovered The Grove) and was buried at Yoxford on 21 August. Lucy Elizabeth Davy, widow of William Barlee, rector of Wrentham, through John Mitford, offered her brother's Suffolk collections, brass rubbings, and many rare pamphlets to Frederic Madden, keeper of the manuscripts at the British Museum, for &pound;500, but only &pound;200 was forthcoming.<br>
