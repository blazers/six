<span class="headword">Brook <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Knewstub]</span>,  Helen Grace</span>, Lady Brook  (1907&#150;1997), <span class="occ">advocate of birth control</span>, was born on 12 October 1907 at the Chenil Gallery, 183a Kings Road, Chelsea, London. She was the eldest among the six children of John Knewstub, who ran the gallery, and Helen Harriett Hillier, an Irish artist's model. The gallery exhibited work by Knewstub's brothers-in-law Sir William Orpen and Sir William Rothenstein, as well as artists such as Augustus John and Helen Brook's grandfather Walter Knewstub, who had been a pupil of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.<br>
<br>Helen's mother had converted to Roman Catholicism and sent her daughter to be educated at the Convent of the Holy Child Jesus in Mark Cross, Sussex. Helen loathed the Catholic church and once adult converted to the Church of England. After completing her education at seventeen, Helen had difficulty finding employment and briefly became her father's secretary at the Chenil Gallery. On 10 March 1928 she married (William) George Whitaker (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), violinist and leader of the Chenil Chamber Orchestra. In common with many young women of her generation she knew almost nothing about sexual behaviour, and found marriage a great shock. She had little time to adjust, as her first daughter Christine arrived in April 1929, following the failure of the couple's birth-control method, a device called the whirling spray; &#145;There was a rubber ball at the end, which you filled up with water&#146;, she recalled later. &#145;You put it inside you and squirted it and whirled it round&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 October 1997). The marriage was dissolved in 1930, as Helen discovered that, rather than being a round of glamorous concerts, life with a musician was &#145;exceedingly boring&#146;. When Christine was two, Helen departed for Paris to paint, leaving the child for two years with John Knewstub, who was living in Hastings, having separated from Helen's mother. Helen spent about four years in France, keeping company with other English painters including Michael Salaman and Gwen John. Helen's second husband, Ralph Ellis (Robin) Brook (1908&#150;1998), was a very conventional man and her life was very different following their marriage in 1937. Throughout the rest of her life Robin Brook provided his wife with emotional and financial support, and a place within the establishment. He had an illustrious career as a banker, and was appointed OBE in 1945, and a knight in 1974. The couple preferred to forget Helen's previous marriage and divorce, and Christine never felt welcomed by Brook. Helen had two further children, Sara (<i>b</i>. 1941) and Diana (<i>b</i>. 1943). As was usual for people of their social class, the two girls had nannies, and later went on to Roedean, an exclusive boarding school.<br>
<br>Helen was an ambitious woman with a great deal of energy, which she channelled into voluntary work, joining the increasingly respectable Family Planning Association (FPA) in 1949. She began interviewing clients for the Islington branch in 1952, and became branch chairman eighteen months later. In 1959 the Marie Stopes Memorial Foundation board asked her to take over their nearly moribund clinic in Whitfield Street, London. This meant Helen was no longer bound by the FPA constitution, which forbade the provision of contraception for unmarried women, and a new evening session was quickly filled by female students from the nearby university. This was a radical step in the early 1960s, and the board was not told until eighteen months later, when they agreed that a young persons' advisory centre could be set up. In 1964 the first Brook Advisory Centre for Young People started work. In January 1966 the second centre opened in Walworth, followed by affiliated branches in Birmingham and Cambridge.<br>
<br>The first clinic was a tiny operation, and saw only 564 cases in that first year when more than 63,000 illegitimate births occurred. The Brook clinics were important for helping to legitimize provision of contraception to unmarried women so that they could engage in sexual activity without fear of pregnancy. The double standard had always been dependent upon a proportion of sexually active women covertly engaging in sexual intercourse outside marriage. It was by openly treating this sexual activity as respectable, and deserving of society's support, that Helen Brook contributed to changing sexual mores. Part of her strength lay in the fact that, despite her unconventional past, and her young daughters, she argued that her goal was the prevention of unwanted babies. She believed in female equality, not in women's liberation, and she repeatedly insisted that the clinics did not encourage female promiscuity. The permissiveness that flowered in the late 1960s following the advent of the contraceptive pill shocked her. By the early 1970s the provision of contraception to girls under sixteen had emerged as a controversial issue on which the Brook clinics nevertheless took an uncompromisingly positive stand.<br>
<br>Until losing her sight late in life Helen continued her activities, joining Family Planning Sales in 1972 and acting as chairman from 1974 to 1981. From 1980 she was vice-president of the National Association of Family Planning Nurses, and from 1987 she was vice-president of the national council of the FPA. Helen Brook was a magnetic companion, highly valued by those with whom she worked. Public recognition was slow to arrive and she appreciated her appointment as CBE in 1995. She died of a stroke on 3 October 1997, and was survived by her husband.<br>
