</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Home,  John</span>  (1722&#150;1808), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and playwright</span>, was born in Leith on 21 September 1722, the son of Alexander Home, town clerk of Leith, and Christian Hay, daughter of John Hay, writer in Edinburgh. Home was a distant relative of both the earl of Home and David Hume.<h2>
<a name="EducationandtheJacobiterisingof1745"></a>Education and the Jacobite rising of 1745</h2>Home was educated at Leith grammar school and Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA on 18 March 1742. He trained for the ministry alongside William Robertson (soon leader of the moderate faction in the Church of Scotland), Hugh Blair, Alexander Carlyle, and Adam Ferguson. Carlyle records that Home was &#145;a great favourite with his companions&#146;, and &#145;his entry to a company was received like letting in the sun into a darkened room&#146;  (Carlyle, 24, 114). Contemporaries testified that he &#145;was from childhood delighted with the lofty and heroic ideas which embody themselves in the description or narrative of poetry&#146;  (Mackenzie, 6).<br>
<br>On 13 September 1745 Home enlisted in the college company of volunteers to defend Edinburgh against the Jacobite army. With the opening of the city to the rebels, Home and a few companions joined the army of Sir John Cope at Dunbar. As lieutenant in a regiment of volunteers raised by Glasgow, Home joined Hawley's army: he was taken prisoner at Falkirk on 17 January 1746 and held in Doune Castle, from which he led an escape by means of blanket-ropes.<br>
<br>With the patronage of Sir David Kinloch of Gilmerton, Home was ordained minister of Athelstaneford, in the presbytery of Haddington, on 17 July 1746, succeeding Robert Blair, author of <span class="italic">The Grave</span>. He was inducted on 11 February 1747. Kinloch's encouragement of farming on his estate fostered a prosperous and enlightened community.<h2>
<a name="Douglasandotherearlyworks"></a>Douglas and other early works</h2>Home found in Plutarch inspiration for his first tragedy, <span class="italic">Agis</span> (1749), which dealt with the sufferings of the king of Sparta. His addition of a romantic sub-plot &#145;to suit the prevailing dramatic taste&#146;  (Mackenzie, 34) prompted David Hume to allege he &#145;had corrupted his taste by imitation of Shakespeare, whom he ought only to have admired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.204). Home took the play to London at the end of 1747. When David Garrick rejected the play as not well adapted to the stage  (Mackenzie, 35), the author vented his mortification in &#145;Verses Written by Mr. Home, with a Pencil, on Shakespeare's Monument in Westminster Abbey&#146;. Returning via Winchester, Home was introduced to William Collins, who inscribed to him his &#145;Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland&#146;, in which he predicts Home's success in tragedy and enjoins him to find subject matter in his native land.<br>
<br>The ballad &#145;Gil Morrice&#146; provided the inspiration for Home's most famous tragedy, <span class="italic">Douglas</span>. There, according to his biographer Henry Mackenzie, Home found material &#145;which happily suited the bent of his imagination, that loved to dwell amidst the heroic times of chivalry and romantic valour, particularly amidst those in which the great names of our ancient Scottish Worthies were distinguished&#146;  (Mackenzie, 91&#150;2). Heeding criticisms of <span class="italic">Agis</span>, Home eschewed romantic sub-plot and focused on maternal tenderness and youthful honour in a plot comparable to that of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Merope</span> (<i>c</i>.1743), but &#145;as simple and natural as that of the French author is complicated and artificial&#146;  (Scott, 346). The project found favour with the literati, eager to validate in terms of tragic drama Scotland's right to cultural partnership with England. Drafts circulated among Blair, Robertson, Carlyle, Lord Elibank, and Sir Gilbert Elliott of Minto, corrections were made, and, later, names were changed (Douglas for Norval, Randolph for Barnet). Hume's endorsement  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.215) represented &#145;only the sentiment of the whole Republic of Belles Lettres&#146;  (Carlyle, 152). The view was not shared by Garrick who, in February 1755, rejected the play as totally unfit for the stage  (Mackenzie, 37).<br>
<br>Home's introduction by Lord Milton to Archibald, third duke of Argyll, helped get <span class="italic">Douglas</span> staged in Edinburgh at the theatre in the Canongate on 14 December 1756, with Digges as Douglas and Mrs Ward as Lady Randolph. Though then a boy, Mackenzie recalled that &#145;the applause was enthusiastic; but a better criterion of its merits was the tears of the audience&#146;  (Mackenzie, 38). The Edinburgh prologue, appealing for &#145;no common tear&#146; for a renowned Scottish hero, identifies Caledonia and ancient Athens in terms of topography, learning, and the finer feelings such as pity, so establishing <span class="italic">Douglas</span> as a key text in the Scottish literature of sensibility. Here, unlike his classically derived tragedies, Home discovered &#145;a beautiful talent for painting genuine nature and the manners of his country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 3.298). The equation of proximity to nature with emotional intensity, combined with the analogies between human and natural experience, anticipates James Macpherson's <span class="italic">Poems of Ossian</span>. The sustained evocation of pity for Lady Randolph, locating the play within the tradition of the pathetic tragedy of Thomas Otway and Nicholas Rowe, long proved effective with audiences&#151;Robert Burns wrote of &#145;the horrors I felt for Lady Randolph's distresses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Robert Burns</span>, 2.64)&#151;and the clash between the heroic code and her maternal protectiveness provides dramatic tension.<br>
<br>From Dublin, Thomas Sheridan sent Home a gold medal, an action which Dr Johnson found incomprehensible  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.320, 5.360), and the play inspired Frances Sheridan in writing her <span class="italic">Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph</span> (1761). Approving of <span class="italic">Douglas</span>'s adherence to the unities and seeing it as a standard-bearer for Scottish tragedy, Hume dedicated his <span class="italic">Four Dissertations</span> (1757) to its author thus: &#145;you possess the true theatric genius of Shakespeare and Otway, refined from the unhappy barbarism of the one, and the licentiousness of the other&#146;. Not all agreed: witness <span class="italic">The Philosopher's Opera</span> (1757), an anonymous satire, and Oliver Goldsmith's demurring  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 16, May 1757). Even Hume had misgivings, including questioning why Lady Randolph should break her silence regarding her lost child after eighteen years  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.215&#150;16). The language was widely praised (for example, Gray, 2.515; <span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 9.94), but, with most of the action taking place either in the past or off-stage, it is a play of words rather than deeds.<br>
<br>The staging of <span class="italic">Douglas</span> sparked a religious controversy. Presbyterian opposition to drama was exacerbated by the circumstances: the dramatist was a clergyman and performances were attended by ministers. Charges were brought against Alexander Carlyle, and Thomas White of Liberton was suspended, though with mitigated sentence on his pleading &#145;that he attended the representation only once, and endeavoured to conceal himself in a corner to avoid giving offence&#146;  (Mackenzie, 44). Between the high-flying and moderate factions a war of pamphlets ensued. Defences came from Adam Ferguson and Carlyle, whose <span class="italic">An argument to prove, that the tragedy of Douglas ought to be publicly burnt by the hands of the hangman</span> was an ironical piece in the manner of Swift. Carlyle also circulated <span class="italic">A Full and True History of the Bloody Tragedy of Douglas</span>, which added two nights to the run. Home pre-empted prosecution by the presbytery of Haddington by resigning as minister of Athelstaneford on 7 June 1757. Soon &#145;manners overcame the law of the church&#146;  (ibid., 49): in 1784 Mrs Siddons played Lady Randolph to the severe detriment of attendances at the general assembly of the Church of Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Butesprivatesecretaryandlaterworks"></a>Bute's private secretary and later works</h2>Having moved to London in March 1757, Home lodged in Chapel Court, South Audley Street. Bute installed him as his private secretary and as tutor to the prince of Wales, whose mother awarded him &pound;100 a year. It was said that Home was &#145;entirely at the command of Lord Bute, whose nod made him break every engagement&#146;  (Carlyle, 170). <span class="italic">Douglas</span> was staged by John Rich at Covent Garden on 14 March 1757, with Spranger Barry as Douglas and Peg Woffington as Lady Randolph. Its success, and its author's new-found eminence, induced Garrick to stage <span class="italic">Agis</span> at Drury Lane (21 February 1758), himself playing Lysander. Attended twice by Bute and the prince of Wales, it ran for nine nights and &#145;the author made some hundreds by it&#146;  (ibid., 182). <span class="italic">The Siege of Aquileia</span> followed at Drury Lane on 21 February 1760, with Garrick as Aemilius and Mrs Cibber as Cornelia. Though the events relate to the siege of Berwick by Edward III in 1333, Home, politically alert on this occasion, relocated the action in Roman times. While the play suffers from Home's characteristic weakness&#151;predominance of declamation over action&#151;he achieves a measure of psychological realism: the dilemma of Aemilius, who must surrender the city or his two captive sons will die, dramatizes the conflicting demands of public duty and personal loyalty.<br>
<br>In 1760 Home published <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, <span class="italic">Agis</span>, and <span class="italic">The Siege of Aquileia</span> in a volume dedicated to the prince of Wales, who, on his succession, bestowed on him an annual pension of &pound;300. Home, it was claimed, &#145;might have been said to have been the second man in the kingdom while Bute remained in power&#146;  (Carlyle, 208). Others have questioned his qualifications for such eminence, alluding to his vanity, inattention to money matters, and lack of reserve  (Mackenzie, 52&#150;5), and designating him &#145;like many other bards, in every respect the reverse of a man of method&#146;  (Scott, 317). However, far from abusing his position of power to his own advantage, Home was active in the interest of his friends (Knapp, 246; <span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.429). So unpopular was the Bute ministry, and such the preponderance of eminent Scots in the capital, that Hume wrote in March 1763 of &#145;the general rage against the Scots&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.382). When Bute's administration fell in April 1763 Home resigned as his secretary, but they remained close.<br>
<br>Home was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73613/', "Poker Club")</script>, founded in 1762, so named by Adam Ferguson to stir resentment at the refusal to grant Scotland the right, allowed to England, to raise a militia. In 1763 Home was appointed conservator of Scottish privileges at Campvere, a sinecure worth &pound;300 a year which he held until 1770, entitling him to attend the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. These visits may have prompted his notion of standing for parliament in August 1765 on the death of Sir Harry Erskine, a plan which Hume deemed &#145;wild and extravagant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 1.518) and which came to nothing. In 1767 Home leased land from Kinloch and built a villa at Kilduff. His grateful former parishioners &#145;insisted on carting the [building] materials free of charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, new edn, 1.354). On 15 July 1770 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter of a relation, William Home, minister of Foggo (1758&#150;85); the marriage was childless. Until 1779 they lived at Kilduff, where the young Walter Scott was a frequent guest  (Lockhart, 1.153).<br>
<br>Home had three further plays staged. <span class="italic">The Fatal Discovery</span> opened at Drury Lane on 23 February 1769. Originally titled <span class="italic">Rivine</span>, it was inspired by one of the fragments&#151;whose authenticity he steadfastly accepted&#151;translated to Home by Macpherson when they met at Moffat in October 1759. Alert to anti-Scots feeling, Garrick presented an Oxford undergraduate as its author, but so favourable was its reception that Home acknowledged the authorship, terminating its run. <span class="italic">Alonzo</span> ran for eleven nights from 27 January 1773, with Mrs Barry as Ormisinda. With slight variations in plot, it transposed the material of <span class="italic">Douglas</span> to the Spain of the Moorish invasions. Eliciting pity for maternal tenderness, it proved the most popular of Home's plays after <span class="italic">Douglas</span>. Walpole thought otherwise, threatening to send it to a correspondent as a punishment  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 5.445). First staged on 21 January 1778, <span class="italic">Alfred</span> was one of Home's least successful, but most ambitious, plays. Its failure may be attributed to what Adam Ferguson termed &#145;the substitution of a love-interest for an interest of state, which the audience expected from the name of Alfred&#146;  (Mackenzie, 117); yet, with language relatively free of bombast and ornament, the play depicts Alfred as human being rather than figure-head.<br>
<br>At Morpeth in April 1776 Home and Adam Smith met Hume, now ailing and heading south. Home accompanied him to London, Bath, Buxton, and back to Edinburgh. In a letter of 13 May 1776 to Blair, Hume testified to the beneficial effect of Home's company  (Mackenzie, 162&#150;3). The codicil to Hume's will makes reference to the two bones of jocular contention between them&#151;the orthography of the surname, and their respective preferences for claret and port  (ibid., 163).<br>
<br>Home's interest in matters military led in 1778 to his commission in a new regiment of the Midlothian fencibles, with the duke of Buccleuch as colonel. A fall from his horse had the consequence that, even after convalescence, &#145;his intellectual powers were never restored to their original state&#146;  (Mackenzie, 66). In 1779 Home and his wife moved to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>After the failure of <span class="italic">Alfred</span> Home occupied himself with his <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion, 1745</span>, which he had begun as early as 1746. Finally published in 1802 with a dedication to George III, the history &#145;breaks off abruptly at the battle of Culloden, without giving us any account of the manner in which that victory was used&#146;  (Scott, 352). Mackenzie lists among Home's papers an unfinished tragedy, &#145;Alina, or, The Maid of Yarrow&#146;, and two acts of an unfinished, untitled play based on an East India story; there is also reference in a letter of Macpherson to a comedy, &#145;The Surprise, or, Who would have thought it?&#146;  (Mackenzie, 118&#150;20). Home also wrote occasional verse.<br>
<br>John Home died at Merchiston, Edinburgh, on 5 September 1808. He was buried in South Leith churchyard.<br>
