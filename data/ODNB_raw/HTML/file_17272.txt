<span class="headword">Lynne,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1571), <span class="occ">publisher and translator</span>, was a native of Antwerp, and seems to have been active as a publisher in the Netherlands. A Wouter van Lin is known to have issued in Antwerp two editions of Gassar's <span class="italic">Cronycke</span> in 1533 and 1534, and of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Bereydinghe tot der doot</span> in the latter year. About 1540 he moved to London, where he quickly established a comfortable prosperity. Having settled in Billingsgate, he was assessed on goods of a value of 20<i>s</i>. in 1541; by 1549 this had risen to &pound;10, placing Lynne among the most substantial members of the alien community. Lynne is not known to have worked in the book trade during the reign of Henry VIII, but he was quick to appreciate the new opportunities that opened with the accession of Edward VI. The new reign brought a large increase in the volume of books printed in England, mostly vernacular protestant works, and Lynne soon established a place in the forefront of this trade. On 1 December 1547 he was granted a seven-year patent for the sole printing of <span class="italic">The Beginning and Endynge of All Popery</span>, which he had Englished from a German translation of <span class="italic">Vaticinia, sive, Prophetiae</span>, by Joachimus, abbot of Fiore. Between 1548 and 1550 at least twenty-one books were published under Lynne's imprint. He was a publisher rather than a printer, employing the presses of a variety of colleagues in the expanding printing industry, most prominently two fellow Dutch immigrants, Nicolas Hill (Van den Berghe) and Steven Mierdman. Many of the books published for Lynne bear his distinctive mark, a ram and goat with the initials W. L. He also ran his own bookshop in St Paul's Churchyard, the centre of the London trade.<br>
<br>Lynne's special area of expertise was the publication in English of books by the continental reformers. Among his editions were popular works of Luther, Bullinger, Bernardine Ochino, and Urbanus Rhegius. Many were his own translations&#151;others were contributed by prominent English protestants such as John Poynet and Thomas Norton. In his translation of Carion's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> Lynne indeed described himself as &#145;one that spendeth all his tyme in the setting forth of books in the English tongue&#146;. Lynne had been generously treated by leading members of the Edwardian protestant &eacute;lite, and these debts were acknowledged in the gracious letters of dedication with which he prefaced several of his works. Carion's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> was one of two books dedicated to Edward VI, and there were dedications to the king's sister, Elizabeth, and three (the largest number) to Anne, duchess of Somerset. In <span class="italic">The True Belief in Christ and his Sacraments</span>, dedicated to the duchess, Lynne expressed the wish that all men would read it:<blockquote>not as they have been heretofore accustomed to read the fained stories of Robin Hood, Clem of the clough with such like &hellip; but to put away their new errors (grounded upon the Romish rock) by the knowledge of the old faith that is builded upon the foundations of the prophets and apostles.</blockquote>In his translation of Bullinger's sermon on magistracy Lynne presented his work as a direct acknowledgement of the gracious reception he had received in England. He told Edward VI:<blockquote>Considering what great benefits I have receyved of thys your majesties realm of England which hath so many years nourished and succoured my poorlife hitherto. I thought myself no less bound of very duty by to show some office of recompension thereto.</blockquote>Other, less happy, personal experience might also inform these dedications, such as the bereavement which he says prompted him to publish <span class="italic">A brief collecion of all such texts of the scripture as do declare the most blessed and happy estate of them that are visited with sickness</span>. To what is here referred is unclear. Lynne and his wife, Anna (<i>d</i>. in or after 1571), joined the Dutch church in 1550. A daughter, Katherine, attended catechism class in the Dutch church; perhaps it was the death of a sibling which sent Lynne in search of consolation literature.<br>
<br>Lynne clearly enjoyed a measure of patronage from the Edwardian regime, since two editions of Cranmer's <span class="italic">Catechism</span> are numbered among his publications. He was also expanding his business enterprises to other forms of trade, such as the import of wine and hops. In June 1549 he received a licence to import 800 tuns of Gascon wine. With his other ventures prospering, Lynne was by 1550 able to withdraw from publishing, and after this year no books were published with his sponsorship. On the death of Edward VI he reconciled himself to the change in regime and remained in England. This was unsurprising&#151;although Lynne had joined the new Dutch church in 1550, he was not close to the church hierarchy, in contrast to his Dutch printing colleagues Hill and Van der Erve, who both served as elders. Not surprisingly therefore it was Hill and Mierdman who were rewarded with the official commissions of the foreign churches, whereas the most assimilated Lynne was overlooked. This probably concerned Lynne little, since by this stage his time as a publisher was drawing to a close. He lived on in Billingsgate ward until his death some time before 1571, when his wife, Anna, described as a widow, was assessed for taxation. Although his period of activity in the London printing industry was relatively short, Lynne was nevertheless an important figure, not least for the part he played in the injection of capital and expertise from the more sophisticated continental centres of publishing, particularly Antwerp, during this critical period, when the London printing industry entered a new phase of its sixteenth-century development.<br>
