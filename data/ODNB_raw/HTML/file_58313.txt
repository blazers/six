<span class="headword">Deighton,  John</span>  (1747/8&#150;1828), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, is of unknown origins. By the time that he announced his arrival in Cambridge from London, in April 1778, he was a bookseller and master bookbinder, although no record of his apprenticeship has been found. He purchased the stock of Richard Matthews, a relatively minor bookseller with premises on Regent Walk, at the heart of the university, and quickly expanded the business, adding to the stock and supplying, binding, and repairing many books for the university library. On 11 February 1779 he married Mary Readhead (1758/9&#150;1819) of Cambridge, and in November of that year he purchased the stock of the bankrupt John Woodyer, who, in partnership with William Thurlbourne, had once been the pre-eminent Cambridge bookseller. Deighton moved to Woodyer's premises on Trinity Street, opposite the Senate House, a prominent location long occupied by booksellers. He also began publishing books by Cambridge authors, and by 1785 his imprint had appeared on at least thirty books. At the end of that year Deighton left Cambridge to take over the bookselling business of William Cater in Holborn, London; in 1792 he moved further up Holborn, having purchased the valuable stock of Lockyer Davis. His move to London coincided with a marked increase in his publishing activity, and in the nine years that he stayed there over 200 works appeared with his imprint.<br>
<br>In October 1794 Deighton returned to Cambridge to take over the stock of John and Joseph Merrill, at the same time taking on the mantle of the university's leading copyholding bookseller, a position which he maintained to his death. He purchased prominent premises on Trinity Street&#151;situated between the Senate House and the two largest colleges, Trinity and St John's&#151;and rapidly made his shop a central focus of university life, where students enrolled for professorial lectures and learned of their preliminary ranking into classes after the oral disputations. As a bookseller he continued to supply most of the needs of the university library as well as of students and scholars, both in Cambridge and further afield. He issued regular catalogues of retail stock and acquired a particular reputation for his ability to obtain foreign works. In addition he established the first publishing house in Cambridge that could boast a national reputation, exploiting the expanding local and national markets for educational works. Reflecting the interests of the university, his list was particularly strong in mathematical and classical works. He issued a popular guide to the university and town, a glossary of university slang, and the annual <span class="italic">Cambridge University Calendar</span>. Most of Deighton's publications were printed at the university press, and his contracts provided the press with a significant proportion of its income. When the university printer, John Burges, died unexpectedly in 1802 Deighton was temporarily appointed until a suitable replacement could be found. In addition he succeeded the Merrills as the Cambridge agent for the bibles and prayer books published by the university press. Deighton apprenticed his two children, John (1791&#150;1854) and Joseph Jonathan (1792&#150;1848), as printers, and in January 1813 he took them into partnership. Suffering ill health he retired in 1827, the business being continued by his sons. He died, aged eighty, at his home in Market Street, Cambridge, on 16 January 1828 and was buried at St Michael's Church, Trinity Street, on 23 January. Though the lack of personal references suggests that he was not a man of great charisma, Deighton was clearly a man of great energy and ability, and he wielded significant power within the university.<br>
