<span class="headword">Webb,  John</span>  (1611&#150;1672), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Little Britain, Smithfield, London, the son of a gentleman of a Somerset family who had, according to Webb's own son James, &#145;had some Crosses in the World&#146;  (Pritchard, 139). The relative lateness and short duration of his formal education, at Merchant Taylors' School (1625&#150;8), where he &#145;attained a competent perfection in all schole learning&#146;  (Pritchard, 140), suggest that the family fortunes could not have been great.<h2>
<a name="ThepupilofInigoJones"></a>The pupil of Inigo Jones</h2>According to his own statement, made in 1660, Webb was &#145;brought up by his unckle Mr Inigo Jones [the surveyor of the king's works, with whom he went to live in 1628] upon his late Majestyes comand in the study of Architecture, as well that wch relates to building as for Masques, Tryumphs and the like&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">John Webb: Architectural Theory</span>, 181). As Jones's pupil, Webb received the thorough training in classical architecture which equipped him to embark upon his own successful career, although following the interregnum he was denied the achievement of the highest office in the royal works which had been intended for him by Jones and King Charles I. On Jones's death in 1652, Webb inherited his books and drawings, while his wife, Anne, Jones's first cousin once removed and his principal legatee, received an inheritance which enabled the Webbs to purchase property in Butleigh, Somerset, and thus allowed them to re-establish the family in that county. Webb was not only Jones's executor and the chronicler of his career, but also displayed a more than filial sense of obligation and gratitude, and seems to have cast himself as the promoter of Jones's reputation, to the extent that he was still regarded, nine years after his master's death, as &#145;Inigo Jone's man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 430).<br>
<br>Webb's own absence of self-promotion, coupled with the misattribution of his works to Inigo Jones in Colen Campbell's <span class="italic">Vitruvius Britannicus</span> (1715&#150;25) and William Kent's <span class="italic">Designs of Inigo Jones</span> (1727), has in the past contributed to the underestimation of the extent and value of a body of work of considerable significance. He was the author of about 500 surviving drawings, with almost thirty architectural commissions to his name, numerous theatre designs, and three books. When he unsuccessfully petitioned King Charles II in 1660 for the surveyorship of the royal works, &#145;whereunto yor Royall father designed him &amp; to that end only ordered his education&#146;, he recalled his &#145;30 yeares study&#146; and that there were &#145;scarce any of the greate Nobility or eminent gentry of England but he hath done service for&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">John Webb: Architectural Theory</span>, 181&#150;2). Frustrated by the absence of royal works in the 1640s and 1650s, he took the new architectural language of the Caroline court to the country in a series of notable domestic projects, in which he bridged the gap between the school of Inigo Jones and that of Wren.<br>
<br>Webb had made strenuous efforts in the royalist cause during the civil war: he was imprisoned after taking &pound;500 to the king at Beverley in 1642, lent to him by Jones, &#145;sewed up in his waistcoate&#146;; he sent to the king at Oxford the designs of all the fortifications around London and how they might be overcome; and he attended the king again in 1647&#150;8, when he received his optimistic command to design a palace at Whitehall  (Bold, <span class="italic">John Webb: Architectural Theory</span>, 181&#150;2). But it was probably disadvantageous to his future preferment that he worked in the later 1640s and 1650s for parliamentary soldiers and for figures active in support of the Commonwealth, as well as for royalists. Having received a practical and theoretical training in architecture and in stage design from Inigo Jones&#151;he had worked alongside Jones as clerk and draughtsman on the rebuilding of old St Paul's Cathedral in the 1630s, as well as on the court masques during the same period&#151;Webb embarked on his first significant independent designs at Hale Lodge, Hampshire (1638), for John Penruddock, and Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire (<i>c</i>.1644&#150;50) for the parliamentary colonel Edmund Ludlow. It is possible that neither of these was built, but they are known through Webb's drawings and are significant in demonstrating an approach to design which was to be characteristic of his practice. The designs show him drawing on the precedents of work by Inigo Jones and Palladio, using them as a basis for further experimentation with alternative room shapes, the placement of stairs, and circulation. The choice of direction offered by the interconnecting rooms in the Maiden Bradley design, a feature typical of the Palladian villa, would have offered a freedom of circulation unusual in the English house of the mid-seventeenth century.<h2>
<a name="Domesticdesigns"></a>Domestic designs</h2>In being published in the eighteenth century as the works of Jones, many of Webb's major house designs provided, along with the actual works of the master, exemplars for eighteenth-century English neo-Palladianism. The engravings tended to be based on Webb's own surviving drawings, which included his own designs and his presentation drawings of designs by Jones, which perhaps he had made with publication in mind. Later authors had difficulty in distinguishing between them, a problem compounded by the fact that the houses themselves often did not exist in the planned form. For example, at Belvoir Castle belonging to the earl and countess of Rutland, for which he produced designs in the 1650s for what might have become the first great neo-Palladian mansion in England sixty years before Colen Campbell's Wanstead, Webb had to confine himself to rebuilding the house to its existing ground-plan (1655&#150;68). He retained some of the Tudor building in his remodelling, but succeeded in incorporating a grand Imperial staircase (of three parallel flights within an open well) which provided a triumphal approach to the great dining-room on the first floor. For the fourth duke of Lennox and Richmond at Cobham Hall, Kent, and for the fourth earl of Pembroke at Durham House, London, Webb had also supplied grand schemes for palatial rebuildings in the 1640s. Neither of these was carried out, and both remained unpublished, but aspects of the designs were to resurface first at Belvoir, then in his unbuilt schemes for Whitehall Palace. All of these designs confirm Webb's use of precedent&#151;not only the designs of Jones and Palladio, but also those of the latter's follower Scamozzi&#151;and his putting into practice of his training in theory: at Belvoir he drew on his earlier studies of the form of the ancient Roman house, as reconstructed by Palladio. He did not follow his sources slavishly, but drew lessons from them, arriving through the process of drawing&#151;which was habitual to him&#151;at his own distinct formulation. The results may be best appreciated by considering the only two houses which remarkably, in view of the extent of his practice, he was able to design and build from start to finish: Gunnersbury House, Middlesex (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;63, for Sir John Maynard; dem. 1800&#150;01), and Amesbury Abbey, Wiltshire (<i>c</i>.1659&#150;64, for the marquess of Hertford; rebuilt after 1834).<br>
<br>Gunnersbury, which appeared in Campbell's <span class="italic">Vitruvius Britannicus</span> and was owned from 1762 until 1786 by Princess Amelia, the third daughter of King George II, was the fashionable suburban villa <i>par excellence</i>, recognized in the eighteenth century as a house of archetypal importance. In its planning Webb contrived to combine a central sequence of public spaces with groups of interconnecting private rooms, indicative of a new impetus in English architecture towards spatial separation and the provision of privacy. A processional route led from a columned entrance hall via an Imperial staircase to a coved first-floor saloon of double-cube form, and a loggia which afforded views south towards Surrey and the River Thames. Such a sequence, of unprecedented classical grandeur in English architecture, had not met with unqualified approval in the seventeenth century: Webb's reliance on classical and Renaissance precedents had been criticized by both Sir Roger Pratt and Roger North, both of whom found the poor lighting of the hall and saloon a drawback in the design.<br>
<br>At Amesbury, which appeared in both Campbell's and Kent's publications, Webb achieved a more sophisticated synthesis in a composition whose &#145;uncommon granduer [<i>sic</i>]&#146;, according to the architect C. R. Cockerell, who visited in 1823, &#145;fills &amp; occupies the mind&#146;  (Harris, &#145;Cockerell&#146;, 7). By positioning the hall and first-floor saloon across the front of the house, rather than transversely, as they had been placed at Gunnersbury, and providing short corridors through the centre of the house between the suites of private rooms, Webb was able to achieve an economical balance between well-lit public spaces and discrete but accessible private ones. The staircase, an extraordinary contrivance, rose through two storeys, with the ingenious oval service stair rising in the central newel. This feature, particularly admired by Cockerell, and copied in designs by both Sir William Chambers (at Roehampton, Surrey, 1760&#150;68) and James Paine (at Belford Hall, Northumberland, 1754&#150;6) was perhaps more of an architectural conceit than a practical solution to problems of circulation. Although appearing elegant in planning terms, it perhaps did not achieve the same significant division between householders and servants at Amesbury as Webb had achieved between public and private spaces in his layout of the rooms.<br>
<br>Webb's most substantial surviving domestic works are the sequence of staterooms at Wilton House, Wiltshire, and a wing at Lamport Hall, Northamptonshire. The dating and authorship of the work at Wilton has been the subject of some debate, but the evidence of both documentation and drawings suggests that Webb was at work here for the fourth and fifth earls of Pembroke on two occasions. In the late 1630s, as a young man, he appears to have assisted Inigo Jones in designing ceilings and doors for a new south range, the building of which was overseen by Isaac de Caus; following a major fire in 1647, a dated drawing of 1649 indicates his responsibility for the remodelling of the distinctive towers and for the lavish, francophile redecoration of the Single Cube and Double Cube rooms. Here his innovative substitution of deeply coved ceilings for the flat ceilings destroyed in the fire provided rich fields for painted decoration. The naturalistic carving of the overmantels throughout the sequence of staterooms, and the liberal deployment of exuberant swags and garlands in the panelling of the walls make Wilton, despite some later alterations, the supreme surviving example of the Caroline grand style.<br>
<br>At Lamport Hall, built for Sir Justinian Isham in 1654&#150;7, Webb provided a new wing, attached to an older house, which had the appearance of a free-standing small villa. The house has since been remodelled and extended, but Webb's wing survives in all its essentials. In a compact amalgamation of one- and two-storey spaces he supplied the newly married Isham with a handsome &#145;High Roome&#146;, now known as the Music Hall, and two further ground-floor rooms with bedchambers above. The most distinctive interior feature, the powerfully modelled chimneypiece and overmantel, is comparable with Webb's surviving work at nearby Drayton House, Northamptonshire (1653), for the second earl of Peterborough, and at Wilton. Lamport's significance rests not only on its being a rare survival but also on its unusually rich documentation. A substantial number of Webb's letters to Isham survive, with a large body of drawings, together with a further group of letters from the contractor and the mason which chronicle the progress of the building work for the benefit of the royalist client who in 1655 was detained in St James's Palace. At this early period in the development of the architectural profession the letters offer insights into architectural practice and the design process. Webb stands revealed, here as elsewhere, as a man with clear ideas on what he wants to achieve but is fundamentally pragmatic: &#145;smale things must give way to great&#146;  (Bold, &#145;John Webb and the Lamport Recinct&#146;, 55). He was not able to convince Isham in 1654 of the desirability of building a portico: although, being a critical user of his sources, he was aware that Palladio was indulging in special pleading in arguing that porticoes were used on the houses of the ancients after the model of temples, he had nevertheless recommended one to Isham as &#145;a great ornament &amp; much usefull&#146;, engaging in some special pleading himself by seeking to reassure his patron that &#145;it shall not appeare temple like&#146;  (Gotch, 568). He succeeded the following year in building the first projecting temple front on an English country house at The Vyne, Hampshire, for the parliamentarian Chaloner Chute MP.<h2>
<a name="Royalworks"></a>Royal works</h2>Notwithstanding his success in domestic practice, Webb's chief professional hopes lay in the royal works. He had worked with Inigo Jones in the 1630s on designs for Somerset House, producing drawings of Jones's two grand, unbuilt designs for a new Strand front, and in 1661&#150;4 he built the handsome arcaded river-front building for the dowager Queen Henrietta Maria which survived until Sir William Chambers's rebuilding of 1776&#150;96. Again following Jones, Webb worked for twenty-five years on a succession of unrealized designs for a new Whitehall Palace and, after the Restoration, was employed on the designing of a new royal palace at Greenwich. At the request of the council of state he had prepared Whitehall against the king's return in 1660, spending over &pound;8000. His petitions to King Charles II for the surveyorship in 1660 and 1669 made clear both his experience and his expectation of preferment, but he was disadvantaged through having no official post to reclaim, having been employed as deputy by Inigo Jones himself, rather than by King Charles I. He was passed over on both occasions, first in favour of Sir John Denham, described by John Evelyn as &#145;a better Poet than Architect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 430), then, more justifiably in favour of Christopher Wren. He received some consolation in 1666 in being appointed &#145;Surveyor Assistant unto Sir John Denham&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1666&#150;7</i>, 286) at Greenwich at a fee of &pound;200 per year, payable from the commencement of work in January 1664.<br>
<br>The experience gained by Webb in producing a succession of designs for Whitehall Palace was fundamental to the success of his design for Greenwich. Although only one block, the King Charles building, of a projected three-range palace was built, it illustrates how far Webb's architecture had developed from its Jonesian beginnings. The early Whitehall drawings by Jones, in common with his schemes for Somerset House, were composed of an accumulation of small units, so although the overall size of the proposed buildings was considerable, the scale was not. Webb, first in his Whitehall schemes, then emphatically at Greenwich, demonstrated a command of the large units as well as the mastery of detail which characterize the baroque palace. The King Charles building, given vertical emphasis by the giant order at the centre and ends which balances the strong horizontals of string course and rustication, represented the culmination of Webb's prolonged investigation of the possibilities of the classical language of architecture. He was again drawing on the work of Palladio and Scamozzi but now, in his full maturity as an architect, fully assimilating his sources and deploying them to new and more dramatic ends. Regrettably, the King Charles building was left uncompleted and boarded up in 1670, and it stood empty for over twenty years until it was converted by Christopher Wren to become the first block of the Royal Hospital for Seamen. Webb's drawings for the interior, which show details of the decoration proposed for all of the main staterooms, give an idea of what might have been if the royal finances had permitted completion. The coved ceilings, with inset rectangular panels, and the francophile swags and garlands, recall Wilton, although at Greenwich the degree of naturalism in the carving appears still more advanced for its date.<h2>
<a name="Publications"></a>Publications</h2>At Greenwich, as he had done in his country house designs and in his one institutional building, the short-lived Physicians' College, London (1651&#150;3; destroyed in the great fire, 1666), Webb employed his characteristic composite capitals, combining the lion and unicorn from the royal arms with the acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order. He appears to have intended to publish a &#145;Book of Capitols&#146;, for which he prepared a number of finished drawings of heraldic and mythological capitals, &#145;in tender and worke for sundry Noblemen and persons of Quality in England&#146;  (RIBA BAL, and Chatsworth Album 26, no. 125). There were Italian and Jonesian precedents for such emblematic designs, but those by Webb were of particular significance since many of them were carried out. They might appear to have been fanciful, but in view of what can be gleaned of Webb's seriousness of purpose in architecture, it is more likely that they were designed to carry a significant message. In 1669, towards the end of his architectural career, Webb entered the debate on the identification of the language spoken by Adam by publishing <span class="italic">An historical essay endeavouring a probability that the language of the empire of China is the primitive language</span>. An expanded essay, written in response to criticism of the first, survives in manuscript. Just as he had sought in architecture to draw on the example of antiquity, mediated by Palladio and Jones, so in the consideration of language he looked for evidence of unsullied antiquity and purity. For Webb Chinese characters, uncorrupted by the effects of foreign contact and understood by 200 million people, expressed concepts in a language of antiquity, simplicity, and generality. It is probable that he regarded his composite capitals in the same way, as vehicles for the communication of ideal conceptions.<br>
<br>Webb's enthusiasm for the investigation and explanation of origins was demonstrated throughout his career. Writing as if in the person of Inigo Jones, Webb published in 1655 <span class="italic">The most Notable Antiquity of Great Britain, Vulgarly called Stone-Heng</span>, based on Jones's theory that the monument was built as a Roman temple of the Tuscan order, open to the sky, dedicated to the god Coelus, the heaven. Following the publication in 1663 of <span class="italic">Chorea gigantum</span>, in which Dr Walter Charleton attributed Stonehenge to the Danes, Webb sought to defend Jones's unprecedented explanation in <span class="italic">A Vindication of Stone Heng Restored</span> (1665), in which he presented a vindication of Jones's argument and provided an invaluable account of the character, life, and work of &#145;the Vitruvius of his age&#146;: &#145;What was truly meant by the Art of Design was scarcely known in this Kingdom, until he &hellip; brought it in use and esteem among us here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 125). The seal would have been set on this revolution wrought by Jones and built upon by Webb if he had succeeded in publishing the large corpus of theoretical drawings, embracing the classical orders, temples and churches, the ancient and modern house, and miscellaneous urban buildings which he made, probably, between about 1635 and about 1650. Although he failed to publish, Webb was fully aware of the significance of his own and Jones's legacy of drawings and books, and bequeathed them to his son William with the instruction to &#145;keepe them intire together without selling or imbezzling any of them&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/340/145), but the Webb family fortunes did not long survive his death in 1672 and dispersal of his collections was under way within three years. The large part of the collection which is now divided between Chatsworth House and the British Architectural Library was in the possession of Lord Burlington in the 1720s, augmented in 1740 by the acquisition of Webb's Greenwich drawings. The collection was to play a fundamental part in Burlington's promotion of the neo-Palladian style. The remainder of the principal corpus of Jones/Webb drawings and Jones's library was acquired by Dr George Clarke, who bequeathed it to Worcester College, Oxford, in 1736.<h2>
<a name="Legacy"></a>Legacy</h2>Webb died at Butleigh on 30 October 1672 and was buried there in the parish church on 4 November. Although at the time of his death he was regarded as a wealthy man, his wife, Anne, and their eight children (James, William, Henry, Katherine, Elizabeth, Martha, Rebecca, and Anne) received a complicated inheritance, with mortgages on the property at Butleigh and financial obligations to the family of the previous owner. A great deal of time, money, and effort was spent on the ensuing litigation; the property finally passed from the family upon the death of Webb's great-granddaughter Catherine in 1738.<br>
<br>John Webb saw himself as heir to a great tradition: he analysed and interpreted the historical reconstructions of Palladio and Scamozzi and he learned directly from the instruction and example of Inigo Jones; by the 1650s he had become an architect of considerable consequence in his own right. At a time when the practice of architecture in England was in its early stages as a profession, he was the consummate professional, providing an architecture which was rooted in the classical tradition but wholly applicable to contemporary requirements. His success was clearly demonstrated by the number of commissions which he received, from both sides of the political divide of his uncertain times, and the skill with which he fulfilled them. Amesbury Abbey, Gunnersbury House, the monumental King Charles building, and the interiors of Wilton House were among the outstanding pieces of architecture of seventeenth-century England. After his death, Webb's designs stood as an example not only to Wren at Greenwich but also to the neo-Palladian architects of the eighteenth century, and still later to the architects of the Edwardian baroque. The continuing relevance of his work for these later generations confirms the high importance of his place in English architectural history.<br>
