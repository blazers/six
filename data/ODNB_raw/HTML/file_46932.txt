<span class="headword">Wheathill,  Anne</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1584), <span class="occ">writer</span>, is known only as the author of <span class="italic">A Handfull of Holesome (though Homelie) Hearbs</span>, a collection of forty-nine prayers printed in 1584 by Henry Denham, a major printer of religious books in sixteenth-century England. On the title-page and at the end of her preface, she is styled &#145;gentlewoman&#146;, which is all that is known about her social status.<br>
<br>In her preface, recognizing her presumed limitations as a woman, Wheathill counters by asserting her humility and her zeal and claiming that writing the book shows how well she has used her time in her state of virginity. Although she might be merely using her chastity as other female writers had, to justify writing or publishing a book, it seems very likely that she was unmarried. She never writes with a personal, female voice, nor addresses issues specific to women, such as the needs of wives, mothers, and widows. Furthermore, unlike virtually all other general prayer books of the period, her book contains no prayers for women in childbirth. This is probably because she was addressing a general, not just a female, readership, but again, it may be because she was unmarried.<br>
<br>Wheathill was almost certainly a member of the Church of England since Denham is unlikely to have published a book by someone who was not. Her prayers are full of echoes and quotations from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, illustrating the extensive knowledge of both testaments one would expect of a devout protestant. She believes firmly in predestination, repeatedly using the word &#145;elect&#146; in the book and asserting that salvation comes only from Christ's purchase by his &#145;precious blood&#146;  (Wheathill). She refers to the sacrament of baptism, but never mentions the eucharist or lord's supper. This is consistent with the Calvinist theology of the English church in 1584, so we cannot label her a puritan.<br>
<br>Wheathill organized the forty-nine numbered prayers in <span class="italic">A Handfull of Holesome (though Homelie) Hearbs</span> not by the usual occasions (times of the day, going to church, marriage, and so on) but according to a highly sophisticated numerological scheme called the &#145;week-of-weeks&#146;, comprising seven groups of seven, reflecting the seven days of creation. Her knowledge of the hexaemeral tradition suggests that she had access to learned works such as Guillaume du Bartas's <span class="italic">La semaine</span> (1578) and Pico della Mirandola's <span class="italic">Heptaplus</span> (1489).<br>
