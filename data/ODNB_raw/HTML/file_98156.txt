<span class="headword">Rendel,  Leila Margaret</span>  (1882&#150;1969), <span class="occ">social worker and children's campaigner</span>, was born on 11 October 1882 at 1 Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, London, the eldest child of William Stuart Rendel, civil engineer, and his wife, Ruth Frances, daughter of the publisher Kegan Paul. Her sister, Olive, became a doctor and her brother, Robin, an actor. Mary Stocks, Baroness Stocks, was a cousin. She left school at fifteen and was educated by a governess, Helen Higginbottom. She was then sent to a French finishing school, where she became friendly with Eleanor Roosevelt. She spent many of her early years at 23 Russell Square, the house of her grandfather, Sir Alexander Rendel, a Victorian radical. She trained as a teacher of physical training, and her teaching led to her appointment by the board of education as an inspector. However, nature had not intended her for an athletic life, and she was not inclined to be a civil servant.<br>
<br>Leila Rendel enjoyed a close personal relationship with her aunt, Edith Rendel, an active poor-law guardian and militant suffragist, who in 1908 established a large day nursery in St Pancras. In her spare time Leila Rendel joined Phyllis Potter in running a nursery class at Whitfield's Tabernacle in Tottenham Court Road. It became clear to her what path she should then take. Her grandfather's sympathy for her work expressed itself in a financial endowment, which was enough to set her free for the unpaid work she wished to undertake. She founded her own nursery at Cartwright Gardens, St Pancras, in 1911, and for the next fifty-eight years ran a community that was to influence the lives of thousands of children and establish standards in residential care that were followed by many other pioneers. The nursery was surrounded with pictures by Randolph Caldecott and she took his name for her community.<br>
<br>Rendel understood the needs of deprived children in ways that were innovative and pioneering. She believed in giving the children in her care the security they had missed in life, and also provided them with attractive and stimulating surroundings. In the moves that her community experienced each new house was adapted and made what she considered beautiful. In 1947, after the war and a period in Dorset, the Caldecott Community moved to Mersham-le-Hatch, Kent, a magnificent house built by Robert Adam and owned by Lord Brabourne. The surrounding fields, woods, and parkland were ideal for Miss Leila, as the children called her, to nourish the very deprived and often delinquent children she admitted.<br>
<br>Rendel was a huge person with an equally large personality, and she exuded an air of authority respected by children and staff. She was a Quaker and ran a non-denominational service every Sunday in the chapel in the community. Her partner in the early days, Phyllis Potter, parted from Rendel in 1931 as she wished the community to work on specifically Church of England lines. Until then they had had a long and fruitful working relationship. Ethel Davies then became co-director, and she and Rendel lived and worked together until Rendel's death. Together they kept the Caldecott Community going through many difficult times, particularly during the Second World War. Rendel had a somewhat cavalier attitude to money and neither director ever received a salary. She believed that if the objective was right then God would provide. And he did.<br>
<br>Rendel was the moving force behind a great many of the mid-twentieth-century developments in the treatment of disturbed and difficult children. With the financial help of the Nuffield Trust in 1947 she set up the first experimental reception centre in England, to assess the most appropriate placement for children who came into care, a project later developed by many local authorities. Throughout the following years the Caldecott Community served as a powerhouse of ideas for the better understanding of children and their needs, and the inspiration always came from Leila Rendel. She held three firm principles for dealing with young people. She maintained first that it was essential to give children continuity in their relationship with adults, and for them to receive appropriate affection from those adults. Second, she believed in integrating freedom and order within her community. Finally, she maintained that it was essential to recognize the individuality of each child and find an identity that might have been lost. Children recognized the love that Rendel intuitively gave them, but also that there were necessary boundaries.<br>
<br>Rendel gave evidence to the Curtis committee, set up in 1945 to examine the changes that needed to be made in looking after deprived children. As a result children's departments were established by local authorities, and it was not surprising that she was then asked to be a member of the Home Office advisory council on child care. She was a lifelong friend of Kurt Hahn, the creator of Gordonstoun School, of which she became a founder governor and where she spent a week every year. She was a co-opted member of the Kent education committee and of the Kent children's committee from its inception in 1948, and remained an active member until her final illness. Her contribution to working with children was recognized in 1948 when she was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Rendel suffered a fall in her house on 16 March 1969. While she was lying on the floor with a broken hip, waiting for the ambulance to take her to Ashford Hospital, she insisted on reading the latest book on child care as she did not like to waste time. She died of heart failure during the operation later that day and was cremated at Lenham. She wrote in the Caldecott Community's charter that &#145;The Community exists solely that it may go forward on an eternal quest for ever seeking to discover God's purpose for his world and for each individual soul in his world.&#146; That quest never left her.<br>
