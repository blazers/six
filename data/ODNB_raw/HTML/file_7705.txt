<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dixon,  Robert</span>  (1614/15&#150;1688), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of James Dixon of Aldersgate, London, a member of the Cutlers' Company, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Walter Betson of Cambridge. He attended the Perse School in Cambridge and matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, on 22 March 1631, aged sixteen, by which time his father had died. He graduated BA in 1635 and proceeded MA in 1638. He was ordained on 21 September 1639 and afterwards seems to have obtained a benefice in Kent. He married Sarah Mabb of Bearsted; by 1663 they had three children, of whom the eldest was then aged seventeen.<br>
<br>In 1644, returning from preaching a funeral sermon in Gravesend, he was arrested in the yard of The Crown inn, Rochester, apparently for his royalism and his refusal to take the covenant. According to his son James he spent fourteen months in close confinement in Knole House, near Sevenoaks, and, later, at Leeds Castle in Kent. In 1647 he was presented to the rectory of Tunstall in Kent, from which he was soon sequestrated for royalism. He was incorporated at Oxford on 12 July 1653. He was restored to the parish of Tunstall in 1660 and was made vicar of St Nicholas, Rochester, and a prebendary of Rochester Cathedral in the same year. In June 1661 his son Robert (<i>b</i>. 1646) entered St John's, Cambridge, as did his other son, James (<i>b</i>. 1648), in March of the following year. In March 1668 he dedicated <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Faith, Justification and Assurance</span> to the royalist Sir Edward Hales of Tunstall Place, his &#145;first Benefactor and most liberal Patron of my Studies&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>). Later in the same year he was created DD after the king wrote to the University of Cambridge on his behalf. In 1670 he became vicar of Stockbury in Kent. In 1674 he published <span class="italic">The Degrees of Consanguinity, and Affinity</span>. This work was intended to inform readers as to which relationships were prohibited by God and which were not: the first page contains a quotation from <span class="roman">Leviticus</span> 18: 6, &#145;None of you shall approach to any that is near of Kin to him.&#146; In <span class="italic">The Nature of the Two Testaments</span> (1676) he attacked presbyterians and Catholics alike, and argued: &#145;I take them to be the best Divines &hellip; that preach the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and not the <span class="roman">Old</span>&#146;. This work also contains a particularly striking eulogy of &#145;the most Excellent&#146; Hugo Grotius  (sig. B2<i>r</i>). In 1681 he published <span class="italic">A Short Essay of Modern Divinity</span>, and two years later a certain R. D. published <span class="italic">Candida, or, The Witches</span>, a &#145;crazy&#146; and &#145;eccentric&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) verse satire on existing society. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> doubted the traditional attribution of this title to Robert Dixon, but it was printed and published by Samuel Roycroft and Robert Clavell, both of whom produced two titles for Dixon in 1681. In addition Samuel Roycroft's father, Thomas, had printed two pamphlets for Dixon in the 1670s. The likelihood is, therefore, that <span class="italic">Candida</span> was indeed written by Robert Dixon. He died in May 1688, and was survived by his wife.<br>
