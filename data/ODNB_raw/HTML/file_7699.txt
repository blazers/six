<span class="headword">Dixon,  James</span>  (1788&#150;1871), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister</span>, was born on 29 October 1788 at King's Mills, a hamlet near Castle Donington in Leicestershire. After his conversion in 1807 and a period in local preaching, he became a Wesleyan minister in 1812. For some years he attracted no particular notice in the circuits in which he served. It was after his return from Gibraltar in 1825 that his remarkable gifts began to be observed, and he was soon regarded as among the leading preachers of the Wesleyan body. He was elected president of the conference in 1841, when he preached the sermon &#145;Methodism in its origin, economy, and present position&#146; (subsequently published). In 1847 he was elected representative of the English conference to the conference of the Methodist Episcopal church in the United States, and also president of the conference of Canada. While in North America he preached and addressed meetings in many of the chief cities. His well-known work <span class="italic">Methodism in America</span> (1849) was the fruit of this visit.<br>
<br>Dixon remained in the itinerant Wesleyan ministry for fifty years, travelling in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and other large towns. His preaching was entirely original, and was marked by grandeur, thought, and impassioned feeling. His reputation as a platform speaker was equally high. His speeches at the great Wesleyan missionary anniversaries, and on the slave trade, popery, and other such questions as then stirred the evangelical party in England, were celebrated. He was selected several times to represent the Methodist church at mass meetings connected with these issues. Dixon belonged to the middle period of Methodism, the period with which are associated the names of Jabez Bunting, Richard Watson (whose daughter Mary he married), and Thomas Jackson. Dixon was author of a <span class="italic">Memoir of the Rev. W. Edward Miller</span>, the organist and tune writer, and of several published sermons, charges, and lectures. He also wrote occasionally in the <span class="italic">London Quarterly Review</span>, which he had helped to establish. But the great work of his life was preaching, and his sermons were among the most ennobling and beautiful examples of the modern evangelical pulpit. Because of his failing sight Dixon retired from the full-time ministry in 1862, spending his closing years in Bradford, where he died on 28 December 1871. Among his surviving children was the ecclesiastical historian and poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7704/', "Richard Watson Dixon")</script>.<br>
