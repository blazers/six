<span class="headword">Herbert, Sir  Percy Egerton</span>  (1822&#150;1876), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born at Powis Castle, near Welshpool, on 15 April 1822, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13024/', "Edward Herbert, second earl of Powis (1785&#150;1848)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Lucy Graham (<i>d</i>. 1875), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11200/', "James Graham, the third duke of Montrose")</script>. Herbert's father was the grandson of Robert Clive, first Baron Clive of Plassey. Herbert was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In January 1840 he was appointed ensign 43rd (Monmouthshire) light infantry, in which he became lieutenant on 7 September 1841 and captain on 19 June 1846.<br>
<br>Herbert saw much hard service with his regiment in the war against the Xhosa of 1851&#150;3, and was present with it in the expedition against the Orange River Boers and at the battle of Berea. He was promoted major on 27 May and lieutenant-colonel on 28 May 1853.<br>
<br>In February 1854 Herbert entered parliament as Conservative MP for Ludlow, after an uncontested election. He sat as MP until September 1860. Soon after his election, he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general of Sir De Lacy Evans's division of the army of the East, with which he landed in the Crimea. He was dangerously wounded at the Alma, but was present with his division at Inkerman and at the siege and fall of Sevastopol (when he was again wounded). He was one of the most active and indefatigable staff officers in the whole army. After the return home of Sir Richard Airey, Herbert was quartermaster-general of the army up to the evacuation of the Crimea. For his Crimean services he was made aide-de-camp to the queen and CB, and received the brevet rank of colonel (28 November 1854), as well as French, Sardinian, and Turkish orders.<br>
<br>On 19 February 1858 Herbert was appointed lieutenant-colonel 82nd (Prince of Wales's) foot. He joined the regiment at Cawnpore on 21 April 1858, and commanded the left wing in the campaign in Rohilkhand, including the capture of Bareilly and Shahjahanpur. He then commanded the Cawnpore and Fatehpur districts until the spring of 1859. In December 1858 he was sent in pursuit of Firuz Shah and a body of rebels on the banks of the Jumna.<br>
<br>In September 1860 Herbert resigned his parliamentary seat and became deputy quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards. On 4 October the same year he married Lady Mary Caroline Louisa Petty-Fitzmaurice, daughter of the third marquess of Lansdowne; she survived him. They had two sons and two daughters: the elder son, George, became fourth earl of Powis.<br>
<br>From April 1865 Herbert was Conservative MP for South Shropshire. He successfully contested elections in July 1865 and November 1868, and was returned unopposed in March 1867 and February 1874. He served as assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot 1865&#150;7 and treasurer of the queen's household 1867&#150;8. He became a privy councillor in March 1867, major-general in January 1868, KCB in 1869, and lieutenant-general in September 1875. Herbert died at his residence, The Styche, Market Drayton, Shropshire, on 7 October 1876, aged fifty-four, and was buried at Moreton Say.<br>
