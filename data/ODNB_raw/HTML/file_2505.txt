<span class="headword">Blackadder <span class="st"> [Blackader]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1468), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, is described by Andrew Crichton, in his account of the ancestry of the seventeenth-century covenanter John Blackadder, as having been &#145;remarkable for courage and daring enterprise&#146; on the Anglo-Scottish borders in the fifteenth century  (Crichton, 2). Crichton, who was clearly drawing on a manuscript family history, wrongly names Robert as Cuthbert in a report of his life and exploits which is only sometimes, and then probably coincidentally, reliable. Record evidence shows that Blackadder took his name from Blackadder in Berwickshire, where in 1452 the estate he had once held of the earl of March was granted to him in free barony by James II. Thereafter he received occasional payments for services to the crown, most notably in 1464, when he was one of three envoys paid for going to England to negotiate a truce; on 11 October of that year he was present in parliament at Edinburgh. He probably died in or shortly before 1468, when Adam Blackadder, presumably his son, received sasine of Blackadder.<br>
<br>Crichton, however, attributes to Blackadder a conspicuous role in the defence of the Scottish borders against English attacks and also participation in a campaign into England which ended in a battle&#151;assumed by Crichton to have been that of Bosworth&#151;where he and three of his sons were killed. There is no doubt that Blackadder Castle was involved in the Anglo-Scottish campaigns of the early 1480s, for it was garrisoned by twenty men in 1481 and in the following year the lands around it were devastated by Richard of Gloucester's invading army. And it is equally well established that a Scottish force fought for Henry Tudor at Bosworth, under the leadership of Sir Alexander Bruce of Earlshall. But Robert Blackadder was certainly dead long before 1485, while Adam Blackadder and such other likely members of his family as can be identified as having been active then were still active for years afterwards. Consequently the contribution of the Blackadders to these events would appear to have occupied an indistinct point somewhere between marginality and non-existence.<br>
