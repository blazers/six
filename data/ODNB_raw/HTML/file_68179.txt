<span class="headword">Norris,  Isaac</span>  (1701&#150;1766), <span class="occ">landowner and politician in America</span>, was born on 3 December 1701 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of fourteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20275/', "Isaac Norris (1671&#150;1735)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (1674&#150;1748), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71100/', "Thomas Lloyd")</script>, president of the council of Pennsylvania. A lifelong resident of Philadelphia, he entered the Pennsylvania assembly at a pivotal time, when pacifist principles caused many Quakers to withdraw from active participation in politics. Norris's father was born in London but his grandparents moved to Jamaica in 1678 and were involved in the slave trade. After some doubts about this traffic the elder Isaac Norris moved to Philadelphia; there, if still ambivalent, he remained involved in the use of slaves and became an extremely successful and wealthy merchant, and one of the most extensive landowners in Pennsylvania. His marriage secured his place in the Quaker establishment. He built a splendid home, Fairhill, north of Philadelphia, and there he established an elegant lifestyle and a fine library. Next to James Logan, secretary to William Penn, he was the chief representative of Penn's interests in the Pennsylvanian colony and an executor of Penn's will.<br>
<br>The younger Isaac Norris attended a Friends' school in Philadelphia but also had private tutoring, which meant that he had &#145;an excellent classical education&#146;  (&#145;Norris, Isaac&#146;). He could read and write French, Latin, and some Hebrew and, as a final polish to his education, he was sent to England in 1722 and later made a tour of Europe. Perhaps chastened by criticisms of his own conspicuous lifestyle, his father advised him: &#145;Thou must remember that the more frugal thou art the more will be thy stock &hellip; Come back plain. This will be a reputation to thee and recommend thee to the best and most sensible people&#146;  (Norris papers, letter-book, April 1719).<br>
<br>On 6 June 1739 Norris married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1744), daughter of Penn's secretary James Logan, a union that further secured his own standing in the Philadelphia Quaker aristocracy. Sarah was an accomplished mistress of Fairhill, to which the couple moved in 1741; they had four children, of whom two daughters survived them.<br>
<br>In political terms the period 1736 to 1756 was a troubled one that witnessed the rise of strong anti-proprietary feeling among the Friends. William Penn's successor as proprietor, Thomas Penn, managed his father's affairs from 1732 to 1741 but, as a tory and an Anglican, he was a bitter disappointment to the Quakers. In 1737 he violated the spirit of previous agreements with the Native Americans. Alienated by these and other actions, radical and conservative Friends joined forces to create a united political party&#151;the &#145;Quaker party&#146;&#151;of which Isaac Norris emerged as a leader, with John Kinsey. The party, fiercely critical of the Penn family, embodied whig devotion to liberty and property.<br>
<br>Like his father, Norris entered the Pennsylvania assembly as representative (from 1735) for Philadelphia county; he was also speaker from 1750 to 1764. These were years during which reform-minded Quakers such as John Woolman and John Churchman were worried about conspicuous Quaker affluence, some of it based on the slave trade. At the Philadelphia yearly meeting of 1758 Woolman began a process that involved Friends in the abolition of the trade. More troubling for commercially active Quakers like Norris was Friends' perfectionist attitude towards war and the defence of the colony. Caught between these two views, on 18 May 1755 Norris wrote to an English Friend that &#145;[we] have very much Thrown our Disputes from being a Quaker cause to a Cause for Liberty&#146;  (Norris papers, letter-book). Like his father and father-in-law, James Logan, Norris was not a strict pacificist, being &#145;satisfied [that] the Law of Nature and perhaps the Christian system leaves us a right to defend ourselves as well against the Enemies who are within the reach of our Laws, as those who owe no subjection to them&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Unlike his good friends James and Israel Pemberton (and many other Quakers), who resigned from the assembly because of their pacifist principles, Norris remained as speaker of the assembly until two years before his death. In this role he attempted to reconcile Quaker convictions with actions that most Friends considered warlike. Like his father he also steered clear of moves toward the abolition of slavery. In the end he remained the product of a family whose wealth had originated in slave commerce.<br>
<br>Alongside his political career Norris, in common with his father-in-law, was a noted book collector. Following his wife's death in 1744 he found consolation in the development of his library; in 1750&#150;1, for example, he purchased 335 volumes, many bought from the London bookseller Thomas Osborne. Norris died on 13 July 1766 at Fairhill, of heart failure, and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground in Philadelphia. By the end of the decade his library had become the sole property of his last surviving daughter, Mary, who in 1770 married John Dickinson, the benefactor of Benjamin Rush's Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Housed at Fairhill the collection, described by John Adams as &#145;very grand&#146;  (Korey, 8), survived the destruction of Norris's residence by the British in 1777. In 1784 some 1902 titles in 1750 volumes were donated by Mary Dickinson to the college that bore her married name. This gift, which formed only part of Norris's total collection, comprised a large number of heavily annotated Latin and French texts; it remains a testimony to the broad intellectual interests, energy, and wealth of an influential Quaker politician and businessman.<br>
