<span class="headword">Mathews <span class="st"> [Matthews]</span>,  Lemuel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1643/4, <em>d.</em> in or before 1725), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was one of at least three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18347/', "Marmaduke Matthews (c.1606&#150;c.1683)")</script>, clergyman and ejected minister, and his wife, whose name is unknown. On 25 May 1661, aged seventeen, he matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford. That same year, at the visitation of the diocese of Connor, he was recorded as being a schoolmaster at Carrickfergus, co. Antrim. Some time before 1667 Mathews received the degree of MA and later became DD. It is unknown which universities granted either of these degrees. After leaving Oxford he became chaplain to Jeremy Taylor, bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore. In 1666 Taylor presented him to the vicarage of Glenavy and the prebendary of Cairncastle in the diocese of Connor. However it appears from the diocesan succession lists that Mathews did not gain possession of the vicarage of Glenavy until 1680. In 1667 he published in honour of his recently deceased patron <span class="italic">A Pandarique Elegie</span>.<br>
<br>Mathews was installed as vicar of Aghagallon, Magherameske, and Aghalee on 7 October 1668. On 2 November 1674 he was appointed archdeacon of Down. In 1689 he was one of the many Anglican clergymen in Ireland attainted by James II's Irish parliament. However, in 1690 he was made vicar-general of the united diocese of Down and Connor. In December 1693 a royal commission was established to inquire into and correct various abuses alleged to have been committed by the bishop and clergy of the diocese of Down and Connor. In February 1694 this commission held an extraordinary visitation at Lisburn, and subsequently Mathews was deprived of all his livings. The articles against Mathews claimed that he had not resided on his livings for the past twenty years but instead had lived at Lisburn. Furthermore he was accused of neglecting his cures by not endowing vicars on any of his livings. Instead it was said that he had appointed unqualified and unfit curates to his parishes and only paid them an insufficient allowance. Other charges brought against him included the maladministration of diocesan business, such as altering the visitation books, issuing blank licences for marriage, and presenting unfit candidates for ordination. Mathews was also charged with simony. It was alleged that he paid &pound;200 for the archdeaconry of Connor to be granted to his nephew, Philip Mathews.<br>
<br>The day following his deprivation Mathews left for London to appeal against the judgment. For the next ten years he attempted to lodge an appeal against the verdict in the courts. He addressed a series of appeals to lord chancellors Cox, Freeman, and Phipps, the House of Commons, and the House of Lords, both in Ireland and England, King William, and Queen Anne, as well as to one of the commissioners, the bishop of Derry, William King. He set out his arguments in a series of pamphlets which appear to have been issued privately. In 1703 he printed <span class="italic">The Proceedings Against Lemuel Mathews, at the Regal Visitation Held at Lisburn 1693</span> and <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Reverend William Lord Bishop of Derry</span>. <span class="italic">Demonstrations that the lord chancellor of Ireland is bound by the statute and common law and also by his commission and oath as chancellor to grant a commission of delegates to Archdeacon Mathews upon his appeal</span> was published in 1704, as was <span class="italic">The Argument for a Commission of Delegates upon his Appeal and Querel of Nullities</span>. That same year he published his petition, <span class="italic">To the Honourable the Commons of England in Parliament Assembled</span>, and <span class="italic">Notes on the case and petition of Archdeacon Mathews to the honourable the Commons of England in parliament assembled</span>. In his defence Mathews claimed that he was not obliged to reside on his cures but as archdeacon was required to reside at Lisburn, where the cathedral of the diocese was located. Moreover he claimed that as chancellor he was excused from parochial residence by law. He also claimed that the charges against him were general and non-specific, and that the proceedings against him were hasty, speedy, and arbitrary in manner. He argued that the commission had overreached its terms of reference and likened it to the high commission, as there appeared to be no form of redress. He also implied that the real reason for his deprivation was that he prosecuted the rights of the church too vigorously. Furthermore he believed that there was a conspiracy against him formulated by members of the laity who felt threatened by his activities.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Mathews's repeated attempts to bring his appeal to court were unsuccessful for over a decade. However, in 1705 the Irish House of Lords was receptive to his petition and addressed the lord lieutenant, the duke of Ormond, to intercede with Queen Anne on Mathews's behalf. The lord lieutenant replied that he would take care of it in the most effectual manner he could. Subsequently it seems that Mathews was restored to the prebendary of Cairncastle but not to his other livings. It is not clear exactly when Mathews died. It would appear that he survived into the second decade of the eighteenth century as he continued to petition for the archdeaconry in the 1710s. Moreover, Mathews's successor to the prebend of Cairncastle was collated as late as 1720. Furthermore Walter Harris claimed in 1745 that his death occurred some twenty years previously. On this basis it seems that Mathews, who is not known to have married, died in or before 1725.<br>
