<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bird,  John</span>  (1709&#150;1776), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born in December 1709 in Bishop Auckland, co. Durham, and baptized at St Andrew's Church there on the 27th, the son of John Bird (<i>b</i>. 1687) and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nelson. She died at or soon after his birth and was buried in the same church on the day of his baptism. A commonly cited account of Bird's early years is that published by William Ludlam in his <span class="italic">Introduction and Notes on Mr Bird's Method of Dividing Astronomical Instruments</span> (1786), where it is said that he was a weaver who, finding himself one day in a clockmaker's shop, was struck by the irregular dividing on a brass clock dial and devised a method to improve on this, becoming so skilled that it came to occupy much of his time. This story was challenged by Bird's friend of later years, the clockmaker Alexander Cumming, who annotated his copy of Ludlam's book as follows:<blockquote>Mr Bird told me himself that he was apprentice to his uncle a clothier, that a watch maker's apprentice who was a companion of his having received from his master a watch to engrave in his absence, &hellip; the apprentice after his master was gone expressing to Jack Bird that he could not engrave it &hellip; Bird told him, anyone could do it; and took the engraver and did it.</blockquote>On the watchmaker's return, Bird's part was soon discovered, the outcome being that the watchmaker recommended Bird's uncle to put him to some business where his natural faculty could be applied. The years following this episode are obscure; it was 1740 before Bird emerged into the light of history.<br>
<br>On his arrival in London, Bird was employed in the workshop of Jonathan Sisson, on the corner of Beaufort Buildings in the Strand, where he assisted in dividing the standard yards commissioned by the Royal Society for the comparison of English and French measures. Through Sisson, he met and worked for George Graham, and it is likely that Bird's hand was set to several instruments signed by these two famous craftsmen. By 1745 he was established in his own workshop in York Buildings, on the Strand, making machine tools and small mathematical instruments. He soon received orders to design and make large astronomical instruments for major observatories at home and abroad. He took an apprentice, William Ralph Cole, in 1746, but it is not known whether this man continued to work for him. In 1749&#150;50 Bird constructed a transit instrument and a mural quadrant of 8 foot radius for the Greenwich Royal Observatory. This was the first such quadrant to be made entirely of brass, replacing the earlier type where a brass arc was fixed to an iron frame. Such bimetallic quadrants were cheaper and easier to construct, but had the disadvantage that the two metals expanded unequally when the temperature changed, thus distorting the frame. Bird's quadrant weighed about 8 cwt and had a double arc, one with ninety and the other with ninety-six divisions, accurately cut by Graham's method of continual bisection. It cost &pound;300 and gave sixty-two years of valuable service. The quadrant was much admired and orders for others of the same kind arrived, from the observatories of St Petersburg (for a quadrant of 8 foot radius, delivered in 1752), Cadiz, Stockholm (delivered 1753), and G&ouml;ttingen (for a quadrant of 6 foot radius, costing &pound;260, with a 12 foot telescope, paid for by the Hanoverian king George II and completed in 1755). Many smaller moveable quadrants, telescopes, and other fine instruments left Bird's workshop destined for the private observatories of wealthy amateurs who could afford the best instruments available.<br>
<br>The astronomer at G&ouml;ttingen, Tobias Meyer, devised a repeating circle by which seamen could observe the stars in order to calculate their positions from Meyer's star tables. A wooden model of this circle was sent to the Admiralty and passed to Bird to make up in brass. It was tested at sea by Captain John Campbell, who found it far too cumbersome for effective use. He came back to Bird and together they devised a new instrument, based on the Hadley octant, with its scale extended to 120 degrees and made to astronomical standards. This was the first marine sextant: used in conjunction with Meyer's tables, it revolutionized navigation.<br>
<br>During 1758 Bird was so unwell that he was obliged to leave London for the sake of his health. He recovered, however, and returned to his business, preparing yet another mural quadrant for the Spanish naval observatory at Cadiz, and a new standard yard for the government. In 1766 he sent in a proposal to the commissioners of the board of longitude, offering for the sum of &pound;500 to instruct an apprentice, and occasionally other persons, in his method of making astronomical instruments, and to write an account of this method. He added that the house in which he lived was damp and out of repair, and asked if the board would build more commodious premises for him on the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge. The board debated the matter with Bird, and gave its approval. Two books were duly written and published, <span class="italic">The Method of Dividing Astronomical Instruments</span> in 1767 and <span class="italic">The method of constructing mural quadrants exemplified by a description of the brass mural quadrant in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich</span> in 1768, reissued as a single volume in 1785. By further order of the board a half-size wooden model of the Greenwich quadrant was prepared and lodged in the British Museum, but it is now lost. There is no record of any apprentices being bound to Bird, and he never took up the order to build himself a house on the Surrey side of the river. In November 1770 he was again ill and unable to work&#151;he suffered from the painful complaint of gravel&#151;and continued to occupy his quarters on the Strand, where from the roof he had a clear view to the south and could test his telescopes and other instruments before delivery.<br>
<br>Most foreign astronomers visiting London called on Bird, to place orders or simply to discuss matters of common interest. In 1763 the astronomers Jerome de Lalande and Thomas Hornsby lunched with him after their visit to Greenwich; Benjamin Franklin, writing from London in 1768 about two instruments ordered by John Winthrop for Philadelphia, remarked that Bird did all his work with his own hands (rather than subcontract it) for the sake of greater truth and exactness, and that he was being delayed by demands from France and Russia, as well as those from Philadelphia, stimulated by the forthcoming transit of Venus. In 1771 Jean Bernoulli noted that Bird's instruments were the most esteemed, and also the most expensive, and that Bird polished his own lenses, usually a chore put out to working opticians. Also in 1771 Bird began work on his last major commission, two mural quadrants and a transit for the new Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford. Although he agreed to decline all other work, the size of the Radcliffe instruments obliged him to move to larger premises and in 1772 he took a new house in Little Marylebone Street, on the northern margin of Westminster, where he built a wooden workshop at the rear in which to divide the quadrants. It was a move for the better; Bird wrote to Hornsby, then the Radcliffe observer:<blockquote>For my own part, I wish that I had made my escape from fog and smoak some years sooner, for I find myself in much better health since I have breathed good air. I still have some remains of my old disorder but it is very moderate&#151;I hope it will go quite off. (Royal Astronomical Society, Radcliffe MS A1.18)</blockquote>The work proceeded smoothly and on schedule, the various items being delivered as they were ready.Bird died on 31 March 1776 and was buried at St Marylebone on 6 April. He was unmarried. In his will he instructed his executors, Captain Campbell, for whom he had made the sextant, and Alexander Aubert, astronomer, to invest money for an annuity for his servant Mary Cable (<i>d</i>. 1788), and after her death for the income to be paid to the assistant at the observatory in Oxford in perpetuity. Bird's instruments are characterized by a delicacy of figure, the result of his skill in shaping and connecting the various parts so as to achieve strength with lightness. They were much in demand in their day and are now highly valued by collectors.<br>
