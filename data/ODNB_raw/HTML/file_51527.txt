<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barton,  Pamela Espeut</span>  (1917&#150;1943), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 4 March 1917 at 118 Castelnau, Barnes, Surrey, the daughter of Henry Charles Johnston Barton, a tea buyer, and his wife, Ethel Maude Espeut. She began playing golf at the age of twelve, with her elder sister Mervyn (later Sutherland-Pilch), who also became an international golfer. The sisters had lessons from J. H. Taylor at their home course of Royal Mid-Surrey, but afterwards went to Archie Compston at Coombe Hill, where their lessons were paid for by a golfing uncle. Compston was &#145;a forthright, unconventional teacher&#146; and much sought after in the game  (Lucas, 131). He had a profound influence on Pamela Barton, shortening her backswing and transforming her from a good but erratic player into one who could consistently challenge the best. Without his help it is unlikely that she would have climbed so high, so quickly in the years ahead. Nevertheless Barton's one great defining attribute, apart from natural talent and enormous competitive enthusiasm, was her sheer physical strength, which set her apart from almost all her female contemporaries.<br>
<br>The Barton sisters cut their competitive teeth in the girls' championship, but their first major success was in winning the <span class="italic">Bystander</span> foursomes at Ranelagh in the autumn of 1933: they had thirty-four years and a combined handicap of eleven between them. Soon after leaving school, Pamela played at Porthcawl in her first ladies' championship and reached the final, losing to Helen Holm. This made her reputation, and at seventeen she was picked to play for Great Britain against France at Chantilly. Her England d&eacute;but came the following year, and she played in all of the international matches from 1935 to 1939. She won the French championship at Le Touquet in 1934 and was then sent with the British team to contest the second Curtis cup match at Chevy Chase, Maryland, which the Americans won fairly comfortably.<br>
<br>In 1935 the Barton sisters met in the semi-final of the ladies' championship at Newcastle, co. Down, and Pam (as she was always called) emerged victorious, only to lose in the final once again, this time to Wanda Morgan. She was selected for a lengthy tour of Australia and New Zealand, an experience which stood her in excellent stead for what was to become her <i>annus mirabilis</i>, the season of 1936. In that year she at last won the ladies' title, defeating Bridget Newell in the final at Southport and Ainsdale, and then played for Britain and Ireland in the team that drew the third Curtis cup match over the King's course, Gleneagles. In the autumn she travelled to America, and at Canoe Brook, New Jersey, became only the second lady to have won both British and American ladies' championships in the same year, defeating Maureen Orcutt 4 and 3 in the thirty-six-hole final. Only Dorothy Campbell had ever done this before, in 1909, and it was to be another thirty-three years before the great French player Catherine Lacoste was to repeat the feat.<br>
<br>Barton did not defend her American title in 1937, which was by her own standards rather a lean year, although she did publish a golf book, <span class="italic">A Stroke a Hole</span>, but retained her amateur status by making no money from it. In 1938 she was runner-up in the French championship and in 1939 she won the British title for the second time, at Portrush, a course well suited to the &#145;pugnacious and powerful golfer&#146; that she had become  (Wilson, 92). This effectively ended her brief but brilliant career.<br>
<br>Barton worked as an ambulance driver during the worst phases of the London blitz, and in the summer of 1941 she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force as a radio operator. She was commissioned within the year and was afterwards based at RAF Manston in Kent. She was killed in a flying accident at RAF Detling on 13 November 1943. She had flown there from Manston with a pilot friend to attend a dance and the accident happened in the early hours of the morning, as they were taking off to return home. She was buried in St John's cemetery, Margate.<br>
<br>With Pam Barton's death British women's golf lost its leading personality, somebody who, in the words of Henry Cotton &#145;had the proportions of life right and did not make herself a slave to golf. <i>She loved golf but she loved life more</i>&#146;  (Cotton, 174). As Laddie Lucas wrote many years later,<blockquote>Relatively short of stature and well built, Pam possessed, beneath a head of reddish hair, an engaging freckled face which mostly wore a smile. A warm friendliness, and a modesty which brushed success easily aside, drew people to her. A totally unaffected personality allowed her to devote her days to golf without people saying she had surrendered herself unreasonably to the game. It camouflaged an intense ambition to get to the top. And stay there. (Lucas, 134)</blockquote>It was a saying of hers that &#145;Gentility never pays in bunkers&#146;  (Barton, <span class="italic">A Stroke a Hole</span>, 55). Her example of cheerful, hard hitting was much missed after the war, as British women struggled to compete on the international stage. In America a Pam Barton Fund was established to raise money for the visiting Curtis cup side of 1950, and supported by clubs all over America, but few in Britain were aware of this act of kindness in memory of their former champion.<br>
