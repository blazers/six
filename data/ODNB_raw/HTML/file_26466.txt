<span class="headword">Stewart,  Charles James</span>  (1775&#150;1837), <span class="occ">bishop of Quebec</span>, was born on either 13 or 16 April 1775 at London, the third surviving son of John Stewart, seventh earl of Galloway (1736&#150;1806), and his second wife, Anne (1742/3&#150;1830), second daughter of Sir James Dashwood of Kirtlington, baronet. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26520/', "General Sir William Stewart (1774&#150;1827)")</script> was an elder brother. Stewart was educated at home, at Galloway House, Wigtownshire, by private tutors, notably the Revd Eliezer Williams, an evangelical clergyman who was to have a profound influence on his vocation. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 22 May 1792, graduating BA in 1795, proceeding MA in 1799, and BD and DD in 1816. In 1795 he was elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He was ordained deacon on 23 December 1798 and priest on 19 May 1799 in Christ Church, Oxford, after which he was presented to the rectories of Orton-Longueville and Botolph Bridge in Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>During a visit to England in 1806 by Jacob Mountain, bishop of Quebec, Stewart was recommended to him for missionary work in Canada. He arrived in Quebec on 27 September 1807 and was appointed to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel's mission of St Armand in Misisquoi Bay, on the border with Vermont, which covered a number of townships. From this time he devoted both time and money to the work of the church in North America. As a result of his efforts, and partly of his private generosity, twenty-four churches, some very simple, were built. His first service at Trinity Church, Frelighsburg, in 1809 attracted some 1000 worshippers. This success was repeated at Philipsburg in 1811, and his new churches attracted large, regular congregations. Stewart's ministry was characterized by constant travel; to Montreal at least once a year, and frequently south into Vermont. During this time many of his sermons were printed and distributed without charge, to provide spiritual reading for his congregations until his next visit. He gave considerable encouragement and financial support to schools in St Armand. He was also instrumental in organizing relief work among the sick, refugees, and prisoners during the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14. In 1817, after a visit to England to raise funds for church building, Stewart moved to Hatley, east of St Armand, where he continued the same pattern of ministry. In 1819, to meet the needs of the growing number of immigrants, he became a visiting missionary, with responsibility for travelling to the remoter parts of the diocese of Quebec. On his first tour of Upper Canada he travelled nearly 2000 miles in six months, and this became a regular routine.<br>
<br>In 1825 Stewart was selected to succeed Jacob Mountain as bishop of Quebec, and returned to England, where he was consecrated on 1 January 1826 at Lambeth Palace. As bishop he did not slacken his pace, but continued to tour Upper and Lower Canada, hoping to provide effective ministry for areas which were short-staffed and to increase the number of clergy. By 1832 he had ordained thirty priests and confirmed about 3800 people. In 1833, when the first steps were taken in England to cut government funding for the church in North America, Stewart was faced with fresh difficulties. There was an increasing call for the secularization of the clergy reserves in order to channel the revenue into public education, rather than support for the established church. Stewart, though a supporter of educational expansion and not by nature a controversialist, was forced rather unwillingly to champion the Anglican cause. At the same time the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was threatened with a withdrawal of grants from the British government for the payment of missionaries' stipends. Here Stewart had better success, as the grants were reduced rather than cut off, but this external pressure forced him to urge the Canadian church to become self-supporting. This, in turn, began a movement for self-government and an increasing lay participation in church ministry.<br>
<br>Stewart's health began to deteriorate, partly owing to the strain of his work, and an assistant, George Jehoshaphat Mountain, was consecrated coadjutor-bishop of Montreal on 14 February 1836. In September of the same year Stewart returned on a visit to England. He died unmarried at his brother's house in Grosvenor Square in London on 13 July 1837, and was buried in the Stewart family vault at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
