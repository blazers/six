<span class="headword">Evans,  Merlyn Oliver</span>  (1910&#150;1973), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born in Llandaff, Cardiff, on 13 March 1910, the only child of Pryce Oliver Evans, an analytic chemist, and his wife, Minnie Veronica Edwards, a former nurse. Although the family moved to Rutherglen, Glasgow, in 1913, Evans always referred to himself as Welsh. He was educated at Rutherglen Academy, Glasgow, from 1917, and from 1925 to 1927 at Allan Glen's School, Glasgow, noted for its bias towards technical and scientific subjects. As a child, he proved adept at technical drawing, yacht modelling, and kite design. From the age of ten he received free private tuition in drawing and painting from John Houston RSA and his brother Charles. From 1927 to 1931 he attended Glasgow School of Art, exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1930, and in 1931, when he won the &pound;50 Haldane travelling scholarship and a scholarship to the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>Evans was deeply affected by the poverty and violence he witnessed in Glasgow during the depressed years of the late twenties, and by 1930 he had begun to develop a highly personal abstract style, feeling that the lyrical naturalism in which he was already highly competent was inadequate to the reality around him. His experimental drawings and paintings at this time, combining plant, crustacean, and mechanical forms, announce a lifelong commitment to morphological abstraction, and to the idea that art should be an engagement with life, reflecting psychological, ethical, and political concerns. This conviction was intensified by firsthand experience, in Berlin, Copenhagen, and Paris in 1931 and 1932, of the work of Juan Gris, Lyonel Feininger, Klee, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Ernst, and Stanley Hayter among others.<br>
<br>Evans was not happy at the Royal College, where abstraction was discouraged. Not permitted to study sculpture, he took private lessons from a stonemason. Although he made few stone carvings, there remained a strong sculptural quality to his imagery, and he always favoured the intaglio graphic techniques, engraving and etching, that make possible the high definition and contrast of forms in pictorial space. He left the college in 1933 after only one year. Surrealism early became an influence, and in 1936 he exhibited several works in the International Surrealist Exhibition in London. He associated with the surrealist group around Roland Penrose, Humphrey Jennings, and Herbert Read, but remained, characteristically, independent of it. His work through the thirties assimilated a wide range of influences, from analytic cubism to vorticism to surrealism, and from ancient and ethnographic art. His subject matter became increasingly social and political, reflecting his growing concern over economic distress at home and political disaster in Europe.<br>
<br>In 1934 Evans married Phyllis Sullivan, a former fellow student at the Royal College of Art, and moved to Streatham in south London. He taught art at Wilson's Grammar School, Camberwell, from 1934 to 1936, and at Riemann's design school in Belgravia from 1936 to 1938. In 1937 he exhibited with the Artists' International Association, the London Group, and in &#145;Surrealist Poems and Objects&#146; at the London Gallery. In 1938 he moved with his wife and their infant son and daughter to Durban, South Africa, to teach at Natal Technical College. The European crisis continued to preoccupy him, however, and in paintings that made explicit reference to economic depression, atrocity, and war Evans declared himself a political artist. His style, with its interlock of the organic and the mechanical, and its grotesque morphologies, proved highly effective as a response to the anguish of the time.<br>
<br>In August 1942 Evans joined the South African army 14th armoured brigade, and saw action in north Africa, and with the Eighth Army in Italy, where he was awarded the Italian star. Demobilized in 1945, and his marriage recently dissolved, he returned to London. After a refresher course in etching and aquatint at the Central School in 1946, he embarked on a distinguished printmaking career, in theme and image parallel to his painting. Through the late 1940s he continued to treat of political and philosophical themes in pictorial allegories that drew upon eclectic sources, with recognizably human forms in theatrical space.<br>
<br>In 1950 Evans was married again, this time to Marjorie Few, a concert pianist. After living and working in Mecklenburgh Square for some years he finally settled at 40A Downshire Hill, Hampstead, setting up a studio in a nearby disused nineteenth-century church. In the mid-fifties Evans's work became more abstract, its imagery deriving from wharfside and industrial landscape. By the early sixties architectural and mechanomorphic forms in the paintings and prints had given way to starkly silhouetted quasi-geometric shapes against flat grounds. The expressive vehemence of <span class="italic">Vertical Suite in Black</span> (1958), and further series of aquatints and mezzotints, established Evans as one of the great printmakers of the post-war era. As his work became increasingly geometric he maintained that its implications were always indirectly figurative. His first retrospective was held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956; later important exhibitions included those at McRoberts and Tunnard, London (1963), the Art Institute of Chicago (retrospective, 1967), Marlborough Fine Art, London (1968), and the Victoria and Albert Museum (graphic work, 1973).<br>
<br>Evans was a handsome man, witty and sardonic, whose temperament combined passion and intellectuality. His love of speculation and argument was informed by his studies in psychology, philosophy, politics, mechanics, optics, and the history and techniques of art. He was deeply read in modernist literature and contemporary poetry. He played the piano and trumpet well enough to amuse his friends with stylish pastiches and improvisations. He was practical and ingenious, and a good craftsman. All these aspects of the man found expression in his work as an artist. He was also a gifted writer and teacher. Evans died at 40A Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, on 31 October 1973; his second wife survived him.<br>
