<span class="headword">Hobart,  John</span>, first earl of Buckinghamshire  (1693&#150;1756), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, was born on 11 October 1693, the only son of Sir Henry Hobart, fourth baronet (1657/8&#150;1698), of Blickling, Norfolk, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1701), the daughter and coheir of Joseph Maynard of Clifton Reynes, Buckinghamshire. He was educated at Westminster School and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he matriculated on 20 May 1710, but did not take a degree. He probably left there in 1713 or 1714, when he presented the college with a silver punchbowl. At the 1715 election he was returned to the Commons for St Ives, Cornwall, where he controlled one of the two parliamentary seats. On 8 November 1717, at Thorpe Market, Norfolk, he married Judith (<i>d</i>. 1727), the daughter of Robert Britiffe, MP for Norwich and legal adviser to Hobart's Norfolk neighbours the Townshends and the Walpoles, and his first wife, Judith Edgar. They had three sons, only one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13394/', "John Hobart, later second earl of Buckinghamshire")</script>, survived infancy, and five daughters, of whom again only one, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1798), who married Sir Charles Hotham-Thompson, eighth baronet, survived. Hobart was appointed vice-admiral of Norfolk in 1719, and in 1720 he inherited the Maynard family estate at Bere Alston in Devon, with an influence in that parliamentary seat.<br>
<br>Hobart gained his first ministerial appointment in 1721, as a commissioner of the Board of Trade and Plantations; although he never held high office he remained a holder of government or court positions for the rest of his life. His security was often attributed to the influence that his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13904/', "Henrietta Howard, countess of Suffolk")</script>, was said to have over George II, but he survived her eclipse at court in the 1730s. He was made KB on 27 May 1725 and was invested on 17 June. In 1727 he became treasurer of the chamber to George II; his influence in Cornwall was also recognized by his appointment as assay master of the stannaries, a post he held until 1738. In the general election of 1727 he was elected for Norfolk, but on 28 May 1728 he was created Baron Hobart of Blickling. Following the death of his first wife on 7 February 1727, he had married, on 10 February 1728, at St Paul's Cathedral, London, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1762), the daughter of Robert Bristow (<i>d</i>. 1706), who had been heir to estates in Virginia and Hampshire, and the sister of Robert Bristow, MP for Winchelsea and clerk of the green cloth. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13390/', "George Hobart, later third earl of Buckinghamshire (1731&#150;1804)")</script>, and Henry (1738&#150;1799), MP for Norwich from 1786.<br>
<br>In December 1739 Hobart was appointed lord lieutenant of Norfolk. In this capacity he raised a regiment to counter the Jacobite rising of 1745, and it was perhaps in recognition of this action that he was created earl of Buckinghamshire on 5 September 1746. The promotion may also have been belated compensation for having to exchange the position of treasurer of the chamber for that of captain of the gentleman pensioners on the formation of the broad-bottom ministry in 1744. At some point he bought an estate in Buckinghamshire, costing approximately &pound;35,000.<br>
<br>Buckinghamshire died at his home in St James's Square, Westminster, on 22 September 1756, and was buried at Blickling. He left his Norfolk and personal estate to his widow, who died on 12 September 1762 and was buried on 25 September at Richmond, Surrey.<br>
