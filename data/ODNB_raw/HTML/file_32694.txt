<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dale, Sir  Henry Hallett</span>  (1875&#150;1968), <span class="occ">physiologist and pharmacologist</span>, was born at 5 Devonshire Street, Islington, London on 9 June 1875, the third son and third of the seven children of Charles James Dale (<i>b</i>. 1842), manager of a pottery manufacturing firm, and his wife, Frances Anne, daughter of Frederick Hallett, a furniture-maker in Clerkenwell. Dale's younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67634/', "Benjamin James Dale")</script>, who died in 1943, was a composer of some distinction and warden of the Royal Academy of Music. At several stages of his education Dale faced financial problems. Seemingly destined for a commercial career, at sixteen he won a scholarship to the Leys School, Cambridge. Three years later he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on a minor scholarship and a sub-sizarship in natural sciences; he was soon awarded a sizarship and then won a major foundation scholarship in 1896. In his natural sciences tripos, parts one (1896) and two (1898), he was placed in the first class.<br>
<br>Dale stayed in J. N. Langley's department of physiology for a further two years. His college scholarship of &pound;100 per annum was not sufficient to keep him, and when he failed to obtain a Coutts&#150;Trotter studentship at Trinity, which went to Ernest Rutherford, Dale collected whatever demonstratorships and private coaching he could. When, shortly afterwards, Rutherford was appointed as professor at McGill University, the studentship fell vacant, and Trinity College divided it between Dale and R. J. Strutt (later fourth Baron Rayleigh), and allowed them to retain their scholarships as well. When Dale presented his thesis for a college fellowship, he did so again in competition with Strutt. This time he was unsuccessful, though the thesis was highly commended. Dale was financially unable to remain in Cambridge. He devoted a few weeks to &#145;shameless cramming&#146; of descriptive anatomy and then sat for a Schuster scholarship at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London&#151;awarded on examination in anatomy and physiology&#151;and was elected. While at Bart's, Dale lived with his parents for reasons of economy. A few months before he qualified BCh, Cambridge, in 1902, he was awarded the George Henry Lewes studentship, founded by George Eliot, and made arrangements with professors E. H. Starling and W. Bayliss to work in the department at University College, London. During the tenure of this studentship, in October 1903, he also spent four months in Frankfurt am Main working under Paul Ehrlich. On returning to London, Dale applied for the Sharpey studentship in physiology at University College, London, and was appointed in March 1904.<br>
<br>Dale married that year his first cousin Ellen Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1967), daughter of F. W. Hallett. They had three children, all of whom studied either physiology or medicine. Their elder daughter, Alison Sarah, married Alexander Robertus Todd FRS, professor of organic chemistry at Cambridge. Their second daughter, Eleanor Mary, married Robert Edgar Hope Simpson, a medical practitioner. Their third child, a son, Robert Henry (<i>d</i>. 1957), became a plastic surgeon in Saskatoon, Canada.<br>
<br>Later in 1904 Dale accepted a research post in physiology at the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories offered to him by Henry S. Wellcome. Dale spent ten extremely fruitful years there, the first eighteen months as their pharmacologist and the remainder of the time as director. Here he met George Barger and engaged a number of young men who started their scientific career with him, including Arthur Ewins, Alexander Glenny, P. P. Laidlaw, and J. H. Burn. In 1914 Dale became director of the department of biochemistry and pharmacology of the projected Central Institute for Medical Research, which in 1920 became the National Institute for Medical Research at Hampstead. In 1923 Dale was made chairman of the committee of departmental directors and, in 1928, the first director of the institute, a position he held until his retirement in 1942, when he accepted the directorship of the Royal Institution, becoming at the same time Fullerian professor of chemistry. He retired from this position in 1946.<br>
<br>In 1936, when Sir Henry Wellcome died, Dale was nominated as one of the founding trustees of the Wellcome Trust. He was its chairman from 1938 to 1960, and continued as scientific adviser until 1968, giving advice until a week before he died at the age of ninety-three. To commemorate his unique services as chairman, the trust in 1961 endowed a Royal Society professorship, the Henry Dale research professorship.<br>
<br>Dale was secretary of the Royal Society from 1925 to 1935 and its wartime president from 1940 to 1945, which brought special responsibilities. During his secretaryship obituary notices of the fellows of the society, previously published in the society's <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, were for the first time published collectively in a single volume each year. He also inaugurated the system whereby fellows were encouraged to write and deposit personal records, for the benefit of future obituarists. During his presidency a meeting of the society was held outside Britain for the first time, in India; the number of fellows to be elected each year was increased from twenty to twenty-five and women were admitted to the fellowship for the first time in 1945. Dale set up the British Commonwealth Science Committee, to foster scientific co-operation, which led to the Royal Society Empire Scientific Conference in 1946. His presidency brought him secret duties; in 1942 he chaired a small, highly confidential, scientific advisory committee to the war cabinet, and later he advised the post-war cabinet until 1947.<br>
<br>Dale's last two years as director of the National Institute for Medical Research were devoted to the detailed planning of a building at Mill Hill. After his retirement Dale became a member of the Medical Research Council (1942&#150;6), chairman of its post-war committee on the medical and biological application of nuclear physics (1945&#150;9), member of the advisory committee on atomic energy (1945&#150;7), chairman of the radioactive substances advisory committee (1949&#150;52), of the governing body of the Lister Institute, and of the scientific committee of the British Council. He was president of the Royal Society of Medicine (1948&#150;50) and of the British Council (1950&#150;55), and in 1947 presided over the British Association at its Dundee meeting and over the seventeenth International Physiological Congress at Oxford. He was a trustee of the National Central Library (later part of the British Library lending division) and a member of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries.<br>
<br>A substantial part of Dale's research career, on chemical mediators in the functioning of the body, came from work on a fungus, ergot of rye. In 1906 he provided the first example of an adrenergic blocking agent by showing that an extract of ergot, called ergotoxine, reversed the raising effect on the blood pressure of both sympathetic nerve stimulation, and of the application of adrenaline. Some of this work was done in collaboration with T. R. Elliott, although the two men never published together, and they were some of the earliest experiments to suggest mechanisms of chemical neurotransmission, for which Dale was ultimately to share the Nobel prize. In 1907 he discovered histamine in an extract of ergot, and with Barger determined its chemical structure and physiological actions, and in 1909 he discovered an extract from the posterior pituitary gland which had the property of contracting the uterus. The following year Dale and Barger, after an extensive chemical and physiological study of over fifty structurally related substances, introduced the useful term &#145;sympathomimetic&#146;, now in general use, for chemicals that imitated the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. In 1913 Dale made a fundamental discovery that anaphylactic contractions of smooth muscle resulted from the formation of cell-fixed antibodies, which changed prevailing views about the mechanisms of anaphylaxis, allergy, and immunity. In 1914, in collaboration with Arthur Ewins, Dale discovered a naturally occurring source in ergot of a vasoactive substance, acetylcholine. He characterized its physiological effects, and showed that it acted on smooth muscles, gland cells, and the heart; and in a different fashion, on the cells of autonomic ganglia and the adrenal medulla. Later work revealed a similar action at motor end-plates in the peripheral nervous system. This distinction allowed Dale, over twenty years later, to suggest, and to establish with several co-workers, the physiological role of acetylcholine at several sites in the autonomic nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction.<br>
<br>During the First World War, employed by the Medical Research Committee, Dale directed his energies to war work, studying amoebic dysentery, gas gangrene, and wound shock, organizing alternative British supplies of the anti-syphilitic, Salvarsan, produced in Germany. Immediately after the war he returned to the study of histamine, and with Laidlaw made a beautiful analysis of its vascular effects and the mechanism of histamine shock. In 1929, with Harold Dudley he first isolated acetylcholine and histamine from an animal source, a discovery that greatly stimulated his own, and others', research into acetylcholine. In 1934 he coined the terms &#145;cholinergic&#146; and &#145;adrenergic&#146; to distinguish nerve fibres by the chemical neurotransmitter they might use. For his work on the role of acetylcholine in chemical neurotransmission he was awarded the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1936, shared with the Austrian pharmacologist Otto Loewi. A somewhat different, but immense contribution that Dale also made to therapeutics throughout the world was his experimental and administrative work, from the 1920s onwards, in establishing international standards for hormones, vitamins, and various other drugs; he himself provided the first international standard for insulin.<br>
<br>Dale published numerous scientific articles and two books, one of which, <span class="italic">Adventures in Physiology</span>, is an annotated collection of his most important papers. He also contributed several notices to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>Dale's work was recognized by his appointment as a fellow of the Royal Society (1914); CBE (1919); knight (1932); GBE (1943); and by his admission to the OM (1944). Dale shared the unique position of being holder of two orders of merit&#151;the second one being the order of merit of the German Bundesrepublik (1955)&#151;with only one other person in Britain, T. S. Eliot. In 1949 Dale received Belgium's grand croix of the order of the Crown. In 1900 Dale won the Gedge prize, Cambridge University; in 1909 the Raymond Horton Smith prize; in 1926 the Cameron prize, University of Edinburgh. A research professorship of the Royal Society bears his name and in 1959 a Dale medal was struck in his honour by the Society of Endocrinology. It is awarded annually and the recipient delivers the Sir Henry Dale lecture. Dale was an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, of University College, London, and of the Chemical Society. He received honorary degrees from twenty-five universities, including eleven in Britain; he was the recipient of seventeen medals, an honorary member of the Physiological Society, British Pharmacological Society, Pharmaceutical Society, Royal Society of Medicine, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the Royal Society of New Zealand, an honorary associate of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and an honorary, foreign, corresponding, or associate member of thirty-seven foreign scientific societies. Dale died in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 23 July 1968.<br>
