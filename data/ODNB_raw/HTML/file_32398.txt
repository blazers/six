<span class="headword">Child,  Harold Hannyngton</span>  (1869&#150;1945), <span class="occ">writer and theatre critic</span>, was born at Gloucester on 20 June 1869, the second son of the Revd Thomas Hannyngton Irving Child, afterwards rector of Stratton, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Florence, daughter of Thomas Crossman, solicitor, of Thornbury, Gloucestershire. Child was a scholar both of Winchester College and of Brasenose College, Oxford. After being awarded a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1892 he was articled to a firm of solicitors in Thornbury but after a short period in the firm's London office he abandoned the law. At Oxford he had been friends with George Bancroft, son of Squire and Marie Bancroft, and in 1894 he played a small part in <span class="italic">Slaves of the Ring</span> by Sydney Grundy, the first play criticized by G. B. Shaw in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. For the next two years Child was a member of various companies, playing the &#145;light juvenile gentleman&#146;. His experiences as an actor were humorously recounted in <span class="italic">A Poor Player</span> (1939).<br>
<br>Even before he left the stage Child began to write. Introduced to <span class="italic">The Star</span> by Richard Le Gallienne, he contributed a series of short stories to that paper and his first book, <span class="italic">Phil of the Heath</span> (1899), was a romantic novel of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> period. In 1896 Child married Drusilla Mary (<i>d</i>. 1918), sister of the actress Kate Cutler (1870&#150;1955), and daughter of Henry Cutler, an artist.<br>
<br>Between 1905 and 1910 Child was successively assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Academy</span> and the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, and he was drama critic of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1912 to 1920. Meanwhile he joined his old friend Bruce Lyttelton Richmond in producing the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, which was founded in 1902. He contributed substantial critical articles over a period of forty years to this journal, and on the basis of their quality he was invited to write a number of wide-ranging chapters for the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span>. The theatre retained a special place in his interest: for many years he shared the dramatic criticism of <span class="italic">The Times</span> with A. B. Walkley, and in this he was greatly assisted by his own personal experience of the stage. He gradually established himself as an authoritative historian of Shakespearian production in particular, and up to the time of his death each volume of <span class="italic">The New Shakespeare</span>, edited by Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson, contained a stage history written by him. He wrote a number of notices for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, including those of the Bancrofts, Walkley, Irving, Wyndham, Esmond, and Ellen Terry.<br>
<br>Apart from the theatre, Child had a keen interest in poetry, music, and the arts. He was secretary from 1902 to 1905 of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, and translated Louis Dimier's <span class="italic">La peinture fran&ccedil;aise au XVIe si&egrave;cle</span> as <span class="italic">French Painting in the Sixteenth Century</span> (1904). He was also the author of a book on Thomas Hardy (1916), of the libretto of Ralph Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">Hugh the Drover</span> (1872; new edn, 1959; repr. 1993), and of a small book of love poems, <span class="italic">The Yellow Rock</span> (1919). But it was to <span class="italic">The Times</span> that the greater part of his energy was devoted, and a selection of his articles is preserved in <span class="italic">Essays and Reflections</span> (1948). Describing his writing as &#145;clean and scholarly&#146;, a contemporary stated that he &#145;was best in his anonymity&#146;; &#145;his real works will be found unsigned &hellip; in the files of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Literary Supplement</span>&#146;  (Roberts).<br>
<br>In a series of articles, later published together as <span class="italic">Love and Unlove</span> (1921), Child revealed something of his own approach to life: &#145;Happiness is not a negative measure of shutting out, but a positive measure of taking in more and more&#146;. In 1934 he married Helen Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36904/', "H. Spenser Wilkinson")</script>. A victim of recurrent asthma, Child nevertheless remained a good clubman and a most sensitive companion. Neither his failing health nor the bombing of his London flat during the war destroyed the buoyancy of his faith in spiritual values. Child died at his home, 31 St Flora's Road, Littlehampton, Sussex, on 8 November 1945, survived by his wife.<br>
