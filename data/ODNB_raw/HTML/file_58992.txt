<span class="headword">Meynell,  Laurence Walter</span>  (1899&#150;1989), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born at Grasmere, Oaks Crescent, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, on 9 August 1899, the youngest son of Herbert Meynell, chairman of a brass-founding company, and his wife, Agnes Mary Sollom. The family was Roman Catholic, and Meynell was educated at St Edmund's College, Old Hall, Ware, Hertfordshire. During the First World War he served in the Honourable Artillery Company. Upon discharge he declined to enter the family business and was for a time an articled pupil in a land agency, an estate agent, and a schoolmaster, before settling on a career as a professional writer. He travelled a great deal throughout the 1920s, in Europe and on foot through Britain. While living in a garret in Paris he wrote his first novel, <span class="italic">Mockbeggar</span> (1924). A satire on the &#145;bright young things&#146; of the 1920s, it won the Harrap fiction prize. On 22 September 1932 he married a fellow writer, Shirley Ruth Darbyshire (1903&#150;1955), daughter of Taylor Darbyshire, a journalist. They had one daughter. He served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Laurence Meynell was a prolific writer in a variety of genres. He wrote stories for girls, using the pseudonym Valerie Baxter, historical biographies which reflected his interest in engineering and craftsmanship, including one on Brunel, books on cricket, novels, career stories for children, and, most notably, mystery novels and books for boys. As A. Stephen Tring, he earned himself a modest place in literary history with his first children's book, <span class="italic">The Old Gang</span> (1947), which broke free of the stilted language and archaic boarding-school setting typical of school stories of the time. With its brisk, colloquial dialogue and theme of rivalry between pupils at grammar and secondary modern schools, it set a new standard for school stories. Although not a great book (Meynell's social attitudes and contemporary schoolboy slang have dated it), it was both readable and firmly within the experience of the ordinary boy. The book was recognized by contemporary critics as a welcome innovation. One critic said of it, &#145;if the moribund boy's story is to recover its vitality a transfusion of Stephen Tring is our best hope&#146;  (Trease, 112). Meynell also wrote a series of books about a young boy named Barry Briggs, who at the beginning of the first story is about to sit the eleven-plus exam, which too was distinguished for its realistic characters and dialogue.<br>
<br>Meynell had written a number of &#145;Ruritanian adventure stories&#146; in his early days, but he developed as a serious mystery writer late in his career  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). His most memorable creation in this genre was the private eye Hooky Hefferman, the genial, clubbable &#145;man of the bars&#146;  (Pederson, 748). Meynell's characteristic style was good-natured and civilized, reflecting traits that friends recognized in the man himself. His writing, even in his hard-boiled detective novels, reflected his affection for civility and good manners.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife in 1955, Meynell married on 26 September 1956 the actress Joan Belfrage (1903/4&#150;1986), whose previous marriage had been dissolved; she was the daughter of Francis Joseph Henley, a major in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry. Between 1955 and 1957 Meynell edited the series <span class="roman">Men of the Counties</span> for the Bodley Head and from 1958 to 1960 was literary editor of <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> in the difficult period following the death of Lady Rhondda. He was a devotee of the works of Samuel Johnson and served for a time as president of the Johnson Society. In his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry he listed his recreations as &#145;walking [and] trying to write a play&#146;. His publications included one play among over 150 other books. Meynell died at 14 New Church Road, Hove, Sussex, on 14 April 1989.<br>
<br>The traits that made Meynell's books for children accessible in the 1940s and 1950s&#151;their colloquial language and topical situations&#151;have caused them to date. But he will be remembered as one of the first, if not the greatest, exponents of the lively, realistic, and topical children's story that came to dominate the literature of the late twentieth century.<br>
