<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carr,  Edward Hallett</span>  (1892&#150;1982), <span class="occ">historian and diplomatist</span>, was born at 62 Gladsmuir Road, Upper Holloway, London, on 28 June 1892, the first of three children, to Francis Parker Carr (<i>d</i>. 1945), who worked in the family business of Carr's Inks, and Elizabeth Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hallett. A scholar at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1906, he won an entrance scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, and went up in October 1911 to read classics. After illness abruptly curtailed his studies, he none the less won the Porson prize and the Craven scholarship and took a first in both parts of the tripos (1915&#150;16). The country had been at war since 1914. Because of previous illness Carr was judged unsuitable for the fighting services and instead was recruited as a temporary clerk at the Foreign Office, where he worked in the all-encompassing contraband department that organized the blockade against the central powers. His remit extended to Russia, where he worked to get goods in (while they fought the Germans) and later to keep goods out (once the Bolsheviks seized power). He served at the Paris peace conference and its succeeding conference of allied ambassadors (1919&#150;22), being made CBE for his efforts in 1920.<br>
<br>Still only a third secretary but very much a specialist on central and east European affairs, Carr was transferred back to London in 1922. On the eve of his departure for Riga as second secretary in January 1925 he hastily married, on the 22nd, Anne Rowe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward (<i>d</i>. 1961), the widow of Gilbert Rowe, a close acquaintance made during official tours of eastern Europe to review territorial problems still outstanding. Anne brought with her three children: Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1917), Philippa (<i>b</i>. 1919), and Martin (<i>b</i>. 1921). To these Carr added John (<i>b</i>. 1926). Riga was entirely uneventful except for Carr's mastery of Russian, which resulted in a memorable biography of Dostoyevsky (1931), a delightful portrait of Herzen and his circle, <span class="italic">The Romantic Exiles</span> (1933), and a penetrating study of Bakunin (1937).<br>
<br>After returning to London in 1929, Carr also began reviewing and writing (under the <i>nom de plume</i> John Hallett) on both Russian industrialization, which caught his interest, and German affairs, which fell within his purview in the Foreign Office. It was Hitler's attempt to break out of the constraints created by the allies in 1919 (of which Carr strongly disapproved) that seized his attention and resulted in the first &#145;realist&#146; monograph on international relations in the twentieth century: <span class="italic">The Twenty Years' Crisis</span> (1939). That treatise, still widely read worldwide and still somewhat shocking to untutored minds, was made possible only by leaving the Foreign Office and taking up the Woodrow Wilson chair in international politics at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth in 1936, which he held until 1947. Although rarely noted, Carr's speedily constructed text <span class="italic">International Relations since the Peace Treaties</span> (1937) is a model of clarity and compression, explaining the main events of those years from the unusual vantage point of access to Foreign Office records which were not declassified for another thirty years.<br>
<br>Once again war supervened, and after a false start at the Ministry of Information Carr joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a leader writer on foreign affairs in 1940, graduating to assistant editor when Barrington-Ward finally succeeded Dawson to the chair in the following year. It was here that Carr made his most dramatic impact on public opinion with the publication of &#145;The two scourges&#146;, about war and unemployment, in December 1940. Henceforth his advocacy of radical social reform matched the mood of the country and paved the way for the Beveridge report of 1942 and Labour's victory in 1945. His writing on foreign affairs was no less significant or controversial. Under Carr <span class="italic">The Times</span> became the platform for pressing on a reluctant prime minister (Churchill) the policy of accommodation with the Soviet Union in its desire for a protectorate over eastern Europe at the war's end. Much of the rationale for both this and social reform was also expressed in the best-selling <span class="italic">Conditions of Peace</span> (1942). Carr's prognostications on the importance of economic and social planning on a European scale, free of editorial constraint, appeared later, as he withdrew from <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in <span class="italic">Nationalism and after</span> (1945) and his Oxford lectures, <span class="italic">The Soviet Impact on the Western World</span> (1946). A sequel appeared with his BBC lectures in 1951 in the form of <span class="italic">The New Society</span> which was, however, subsequently more notable as the precursor to his iconoclastic polemic <span class="italic">What is History?</span> (1961), delivered as the Trevelyan lectures at Cambridge, where he had moved as senior research fellow at Trinity in 1955. From 1947 he had to live by his writing. With the exception of two years (1953&#150;5) at Balliol College, Oxford, he was effectively something of an outcast, and even there not entirely viewed without suspicion, his views on the Soviet Union scarcely in tune with the severe deterioration in the political climate following the Berlin blockade (1948&#150;9), which had been worsened still further by the outbreak of war in Korea (1950).<br>
<br>By then, however, the urge to dig more deeply into the Soviet experiment had enveloped Carr in full-time historical research and in writing what became a massively detailed fourteen-tome <span class="italic">History of Soviet Russia</span> (1950&#150;78), researched and written with the help of several able hands including, latterly, R. W. Davies and Tamara, widow of the biographer Isaac Deutscher. The <span class="italic">History</span> was later crisply summarized as a textbook, <span class="italic">The Russian Revolution from Lenin to Stalin</span> (1979). The premiss for the work was that the Soviet Union was as legitimate a subject of study as England under Henry VIII; that the Soviet experience had something to teach mankind; and that the system in some form was here to stay. As time went on, the first assumption took hold and opened up a field of research to many scholars who had had no idea that such work was practicable; the second assumption gradually fell away or was subsumed under lessons for less developed countries which have now largely been discarded; and the final assumption collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union in August 1991. By then, however, Carr had died, leaving behind him a partially completed history of the Communist International&#151;<span class="italic">Twilight of Comintern</span> (1982) and <span class="italic">The Comintern and the Spanish Civil War</span> (1984). The latter was pulled together for publication by Tamara Deutscher.<br>
<br>Carr's intellectual journey had been occasioned by an accident of fate through what he witnessed from afar at the Foreign Office in 1917. As a result his life became extraordinarily fruitful, packed with controversy at every step, and left a great deal to posterity; but a price was paid in terms of his private life. He left Anne at the end of the war, and cohabited with Joyce Marion Forde, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stock (<i>b</i>. 1903), who was the jilted wife of the noted anthropologist (Cyril) Daryll Forde, until January 1964. He then married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57114/', "(Catherine) Betty Abigail Behrens (1904&#150;1989)")</script>, historian of France, on 10 December 1966, only to part with her in the summer before his death, which occurred at a nursing home in Queen Edith's Way, Cambridge, on 4 November 1982; he was cremated at Cambridge crematorium in Huntingdon Road.<br>
<br>Fervently individualist, ferociously intelligent, and scrupulously honest, Carr was by nature reserved and taciturn. Burdened by emotions with which he found it difficult to cope, he was always more relaxed in writing than in conversation. He none the less had a mordant wit and a certain charm when he chose to exercise it, delighting in gossip yet without ever entirely escaping a sense of guilt&#151;doubtless stemming from a strict Victorian upbringing&#151;at such reckless indulgence. No one ever claimed that he was boring.<br>
