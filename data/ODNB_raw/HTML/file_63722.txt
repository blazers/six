<span class="headword">Drennan,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1820), <span class="occ">physician, poet, and political reformer</span>, was born in Belfast on 23 May 1754, the child of the Revd <a name="cosubject_63722"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Drennan</span>  (1696&#150;1768) and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lennox (1719&#150;1806). Of Thomas Drennan, the <span class="occ">minister</span> of Belfast's First Presbyterian Congregation, very little is known. He was born on 25 December 1696. Having graduated from Glasgow in 1716, he seems to have moved to Dublin shortly after 1720, where he assisted the philosopher Francis Hutcheson in running a private academy for protestant dissenters. In 1726 he was licensed to preach by the General Synod of Ulster, and he accepted a call from the congregation of Holywood (co. Down) in 1731, following Hutcheson's appointment to the chair of moral philosophy at Glasgow. In 1736 he moved to the First Congregation of Belfast, affiliated to the non-subscribing Presbytery of Antrim, where he became the ministerial colleague of the Revd Samuel Haliday. Although he published no sermon, he was regarded as an elegant preacher and an accomplished scholar; his close friends and correspondents included not only Hutcheson but the Revd John Abernethy, the Revd James Duchal, and James Arbuckle, the poet and editor of the <span class="italic">Dublin Weekly Journal</span>. In 1741 he married Anne Lennox. Of their eleven children only three survived: William, Martha (1742&#150;1837), and Anne (1745&#150;1825). Thomas Drennan died on 14 February 1768.<br>
<br>William Drennan was educated by his father and by the Revd Matthew Garnet, an Anglican clergyman who conducted a local school. At the age of fifteen he matriculated at the University of Glasgow, graduated MA in 1772, and then took a degree in medicine at Edinburgh between 1773 and 1778. Even before his return to Ireland, Drennan had already been caught up in the excitement surrounding the volunteers, the independent militia companies raised to defend Ireland during the American War of Independence; and he supported their campaigns to secure &#145;free trade&#146; and &#145;legislative independence&#146; for Ireland, publishing his first political pamphlet in 1780. Towards the end of 1782 he moved to Newry, co. Down, where he set up practice as an obstetrician, and where he continued to be active as a volunteer and an advocate of parliamentary reform. His influential <span class="italic">Letters of Orellana, an Irish Helot</span> (1785), published first in the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span> and then as a pamphlet, established his reputation in radical circles.<br>
<br>When in December 1789 Drennan moved to Dublin, he was caught up in the radical revival which followed the outbreak of the French Revolution. He joined The Monks of the Screw, a group of prominent patriot politicians, and a political club founded by Thomas Addis Emmet, Peter Burrowes, Wolfe Tone, and Whitley Stokes. In June 1791 he circulated in Dublin and Belfast a prospectus for an Irish brotherhood, a secret society to be organized along masonic lines and dedicated to radical reform; the paper was one of several initiatives which led to the formation of the Society of United Irishmen soon after. It is for his role as a founder and prominent member of the society (1791&#150;4) that he is best-known; he served several terms of office as president of the Dublin branch, was responsible for framing the United Irish test, and was the author of many of the society's publications. One of these, the &#145;Address to the volunteers&#146;, dated 14 December 1792, eventually led to his trial for seditious libel on 29 June 1794. Although acquitted, he withdrew from the United Irishmen and played no part in the insurrectionary phase of the republican movement, though his ballads &#145;Erin&#146; (1795) and &#145;The Wake of William Orr&#146; (1797) demonstrate his continuing sympathy for the national cause.<br>
<br>On 3 February 1800 Drennan married Sarah Swanwick (1770?&#150;1866&times;70) from Wem, Shropshire. Following the death of his cousin, Martha Young, he inherited a small property at Cottown, near Bangor, co. Down, and retired to Belfast in 1807. At local political meetings, and in the editorials of his <span class="italic">Belfast Monthly Magazine</span> (1808&#150;13), he continued to support parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation, though he became reconciled to the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, a measure which he had passionately opposed in 1799&#150;1800. He helped to establish the Belfast Academical Institution (1810). His poems are now seldom read, but a number of his patriotic verses achieved popularity at the end of the eighteenth century, and he was the first to call Ireland the &#145;emerald isle&#146;. His poetry was collected in <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces in Prose and Verse</span> (1815) and his translation <span class="italic">The Electra of Sophocles</span> (1817) was published two years later. In 1931 a volume of his correspondence was edited by D. A. Chart and published as <span class="italic">The Drennan Letters &hellip; 1776&#150;1819</span>; it is highly valued by historians as a remarkable portrait of the political, social, and cultural life of late eighteenth-century Ireland.<br>
<br>William Drennan died on 5 February 1820 at Cabin Hill, Belfast, and was buried in the Old Clifton Street graveyard. His funeral procession, at which the coffin was borne by six protestants and six Catholics, was a symbolic testimony to the liberalism which once distinguished a city later better known for its religious animosities.<br>
