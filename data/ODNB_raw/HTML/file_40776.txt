<span class="headword">Whatman,  James</span>  (1702&#150;1759), <span class="occ">paper maker</span>, was born in Loose, near Maidstone, Kent, and baptized there on 4 October 1702, the only son and the youngest in the family of three children of James Whatman (1656&#150;1725), a tanner, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1726), daughter of George Charlton. The Whatman family had been in Kent since the fifteenth century. Whatman inherited the tan-yard in Loose on his mother's death, and although he is described as a tanner until 1740, he became involved in paper making in 1733, when he bought Old Mill, Hollingbourne, the site of an old fulling mill, built a new paper mill, and installed Richard Harris. Harris moved to Turkey Mill, on the River Len, east of Maidstone, in 1736, and bought it in 1738, with capital provided by Whatman. He then pulled down the old mill and rebuilt it. It is likely that Harris, after finishing his apprenticeship, had visited Holland to learn new techniques, and that he began to apply these at Hollingbourne, and then at Turkey Mill, installing new machinery, including the &#145;Engine&#146; (later called the &#145;Hollander Beater&#146;) which was used for turning linen rags into pulp. When Harris died in November 1739, he left Turkey Mill to his widow, Ann (1708&#150;1789), daughter of Thomas and Sarah Carter of Leeds, Kent, and on 7 August 1740 she married James Whatman. He became joint life tenant with her of Turkey Mill, and moved to Turkey Court. They had one son, <a href="#cosubject_73479">James Whatman [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and one daughter, and Ann had one daughter from her first marriage.<br>
<br>At Turkey Mill, with the new equipment, Whatman very soon began to make high-quality white paper. The first known Whatman watermark dates from December 1740, in <span class="italic">Select Harmony Fourth Collection</span>, a set of six concertos published by John Walsh. From 1747 many state papers were written on Whatman paper, and it was increasingly used in aristocratic households. Although at first Whatman's reputation was based on the quality of his writing paper, by the 1750s his paper was being used in printed books, and Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill press printed 500 copies of Lucan's <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> on paper marked &#145;J. W.&#146; in 1758. More importantly Whatman was the first paper maker in Europe to make wove (or vellum) paper. Made by a different process from laid paper, wove paper was smoother, with a more uniform thickness, and although at first it was intended only for fine printed books, by 1800 it had completely replaced laid paper. In 1796 Whatman's son told the American paper maker Joshua Gilpin that his father first made wove paper in 1756, and the earliest known example is in John Baskerville's edition of Virgil's <span class="italic">Bucolica, georgica et Aeneis</span>, printed in 1757, which contains some pages of wove paper. After more experiments to improve the quality of the paper, Whatman supplied Baskerville with wove paper for his quarto edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span> in 1759, and J. and R. Tonson printed Edward Capell's <span class="italic">Prolusions: or Select Pieces of Ancient Poetry</span> (1759) on Whatman's wove paper. Whatman died on 29 June 1759 and was buried in Loose church on the same day.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_73479"></a><span class="headword">James Whatman</span>  (1741&#150;1798)<span class="occ"></span>, was baptized on 25 August 1741 in Boxley, Kent. In June 1759 he was gazetted a lieutenant in the West Kent militia, formed in the face of the threat of a French invasion and disbanded in December 1762. On 2 October 1762&#151;at St Mary's, St Marylebone Road, Middlesex&#151;Whatman married Sarah (1744&#150;1775), eldest daughter of Edward Stanley, secretary to the commissioners of customs and a member of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Four days before the wedding Whatman's mother transferred the business to him, and moved to Devon with her daughter. It was already one of the largest paper-making concerns in Kent, and Whatman soon became a leading figure in the industry. As early as 1764 he was chosen by the paper makers of Great Britain to petition the commissioners of the excise about the duties on paper, and in 1767 he served as high sheriff for Kent. When William Hickey visited Turkey Mill in 1768 he wrote of the &#145;great paper manufacturer, who entertained us in a princely style&#146;, and by 1771 Whatman was claiming to make more paper than any other English manufacturer. Like his father he experimented with new techniques, and in 1772 he made his first sheets of &#145;antiquarian&#146; paper, the largest paper ever made in England, 52 in. &times; 31 in., for James Basire's copper-engraving of &#145;The Field of the Cloth of Gold&#146;. This paper was soon much in demand from engravers, and he first exported it to the continent in 1775, a significant moment in the history of English paper making, when for the first time English makers rivalled continental ones. By 1778 Whatman's reputation was such that Edward Hasted, in his <span class="italic">History of Kent</span>, noted that he made the manufacture of writing paper &#145;to a degree of perfection superior to most in this kingdom&#146;  (vol. 2, 132).<br>
<br>Whatman's wife died in July 1775, and on 3 December 1776 he married Susanna (1753&#150;1814), the eldest of the six children of Jacob Bosanquet, a merchant and banker, and a member of a Huguenot family which had arrived in London from Languedoc in 1686. Her notebook on household management was published in the name of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55398/', "Susanna Whatman")</script> in 1952. Their son, James, was born in 1777. The business continued to prosper. Average annual profits between 1781 and 1787 were &pound;4000, and in 1785 Whatman bought a third mill, Poll Mill. He had bought the adjoining estate of Vinters, with 84 acres, in 1783, and after rebuilding the house and converting the land into a park, he moved there in 1787. In 1797 he employed Humphry Repton to redesign the park, but Whatman died before the alterations could be carried out.<br>
<br>Whatman did not make much wove paper at first, but after Benjamin Franklin had exhibited wove paper in Paris in 1777, inspiring several French makers to try to make their own, Whatman began to develop it again: he told Gilpin that he had brought it into repute in 1778&#150;9. The government first used wove paper for state papers in 1784, at about the time that other English makers began to produce it, and he began to make antiquarian wove paper. Whatman paper was used for public documents in Washington from 1789. A series of classical texts published by T. and T. Payne, printed on yellow wove, included the works of Sallust (1789), four volumes of Tacitus (1790), and Livy's <span class="italic">Histories</span> (1794) in eight volumes. William Blake used Whatman paper for his illuminated books, including <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span> (1789) and <span class="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span> (1790). Whatman wove paper was used in several large printing projects, including Boydell's edition of Shakespeare (1791&#150;1804), Thomas Macklin's seven-volume edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (from 1790), and Bowyer's edition of Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (from 1794). At the same time he was installing new iron engines in the mills, and experimenting with bleaching.<br>
<br>Despite all this activity Whatman was making less profit in the early 1790s. He had a severe stroke in February 1790, and his profits fell to &pound;181 in 1791. After the outbreak of war with France in February 1793 a number of banks and businesses failed; this, combined with labour unrest and his poor health, led him in October 1793 to initiate the sale of the business for &pound;20,000 to the Hollingworth brothers of Maidstone. The sale was completed in August 1794. He lent his manager William Balston &pound;5000, which enabled him to buy a partnership in the new firm, but he does not seem to have considered giving any share in the business to his sixteen-year-old son. Whatman allowed the new firm to use the &#145;JWhatman&#146; watermark, and after the Hollingworths left the firm in 1806, W. and R. Balston, makers of high-quality writing and drawing paper, continued to use the Whatman trademark.<br>
<br>Whatman was ill again in 1796, and had an operation in London in July. He died at his home on 17 March 1798, the day on which he made codicils to his will. The cause of his death was never revealed, but it was probably suicide. He was buried at Boxley church on 26 March 1798. His widow lived on at Vinters, handing it over to her son on his marriage in 1811.<br>
