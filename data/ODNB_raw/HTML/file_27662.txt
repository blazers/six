<span class="headword">Traill,  Thomas Stewart</span>  (1781&#150;1862), <span class="occ">physician and specialist in medical jurisprudence</span>, was born at Kirkwall, Orkney, on 29 October 1781, the only son of Reverend Thomas Traill (<i>d</i>. 1782), of Tirlet, Orkney, and his wife, Lucia, daughter of James Traill, of Westray, Orkney. Traill's father died soon after his birth and he was educated privately in Orkney by his uncle, Reverend Robert Yule, tutor to the sons of Thomas Balfour, sheriff-substitute for Orkney. Traill took his MA at Edinburgh and graduated MD, Edinburgh, in 1802.<br>
<br>Though Traill expressed a wish to practise medicine in Scotland unknown circumstances led him to set up in general practice in Liverpool in 1804 where, over the next twenty-seven years, he built up a prosperous practice. Liverpool's burgeoning cultural scene offered Traill many opportunities to pursue his keen literary and scientific interests. His ability to absorb and store factual material on diverse subjects helps to account for his prolific output of articles and papers. He became part of the &#145;Roscoe group&#146; of influential doctors and businessmen devoted to the furtherance of arts and the sciences [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24084/', "Roscoe, William (1753&#150;1831)")</script>], and was a founder member and first secretary of the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society (1812). He was also a prime mover in the foundation of the Liverpool Royal Institution (1817) where he lectured as titular professor of chemistry and became one of the institute's first presidents. On 26 July 1811 Traill married Christian (<i>d</i>. 1842), second daughter of Dr Henry Robertson, parish minister of Kiltearn, Ross-shire. There were two sons and three daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1829 Traill was appointed physician to Liverpool Infirmary and joined the staff of the Ophthalmic Infirmary. In 1831 he became one of four doctors entrusted by Liverpool town council with combating cholera. However, Traill left Liverpool in 1832 to become regius professor of medical jurisprudence in the University of Edinburgh, a position achieved by direct political patronage, a not uncommon way of acquiring regius medical chairs. Traill originally applied for the vacant chair of materia medica, but Edinburgh town council and magistrates elected Robert Christison, then professor of medical jurisprudence.<br>
<br>Traill was an avowed whig and friend of Henry Brougham from university days, and in 1812 had supported Brougham's failed campaign against Canning to become a member of parliament for Liverpool. Traill's vigorous support lost him many tory patients, and income. Among the many notable names in Traill's testimonials were Brougham, then lord chancellor, and Francis Jeffrey, lord advocate for Scotland. Traill wrote immediately to the home secretary, Lord Melbourne, for Christison's vacant chair, which lay within the gift of the crown, stressing that &#145;I have the honour to be personally known to the Lord Chancellor Brougham and the Lord Advocate&#146;  (Traill to Lord Melbourne, 20 June 1832, NA Scot., HH5/7). Within weeks his warrant for the chair of medical jurisprudence was prepared. Thus, at the age of fifty, Traill returned to Scotland and held the chair until his death in 1862.<br>
<br>Traill reintroduced the chair's tandem subject, medical police (public health), discarded by Christison in 1822. An amiable man with a retentive memory, Traill was an able teacher, and never missed a single lecture. His <span class="italic">Outlines of a Course of Lectures on Medical Jurisprudence</span>, published in 1836, reached a third edition in 1857. Together with Christison and James Syme, Traill produced the standard work on post-mortem procedure in Scotland, <span class="italic">The Medico-Legal Examination of Dead Bodies</span>, published in 1839 by request of the lord advocate. The principles expounded are still current practice. Overshadowed by Christison's expertise in toxicology, Traill did not achieve eminence as a medical witness. He was editor of the eighth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, contributing some hundreds of articles but, through ill health, much of the editing of the twenty-one volumes was done by others.<br>
<br>Traill remained an Orkney man to the last. It is reported that he never took a class fee from an Orkney student and often revisited his birthplace to deliver chemistry lectures, the fees from which he donated to the islands' poor. Traill was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1819 and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1833, becoming president from 1852 to 1854. Traill was not averse to the principle of admitting women to the medical profession. In 1862 he supported Elizabeth Garrett's (unsuccessful) petition to be admitted to the college's preliminary examination and registration. Traill died at Edinburgh on 30 July 1862.<br>
