<span class="headword">Porter,  James</span>  (1752/3&#150;1798), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, was born the eldest of eight children at Tamna Wood, near Ballindrait, co. Donegal, the son of Alexander Porter (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1773), a farmer and owner of a flax-scutching mill. On his father's death, Porter gave up the farm and mill to a younger brother, and became a schoolmaster at Dromore, co. Down. In 1780 he married Anna Knox (<i>d</i>. 1823); they had at least seven children, five daughters and two sons. In the same year he moved to a school at Drogheda. Intending to enter the Presbyterian ministry, he went to Glasgow as a divinity student and was licensed, in 1786 or 1787, by Bangor presbytery.<br>
<br>After his unsuccessful candidature for the Presbyterian congregation of Ballindrait, Porter received a call to Greyabbey, co. Down, through the influence of Robert Black, the minister and political reformer. He was ordained there by Bangor presbytery on 31 July 1787. His professional income did not exceed &pound;60, and he supplemented his resources by farming. He fitted up a workshop and constructed models of improved farming implements. By this and other means he did much to promote the physical well-being of his parishioners, to whom he was in all respects a conscientious pastor. He is said to have been an Arian, but there seems to be no evidence of his attachment to a special school of theology.<br>
<br>Porter had joined the volunteer movement which began in 1778, but took no prominent part in its activities. He was not a United Irishman, although he supported the principles of that association, and was not publicly known as a politician until after the suppression of the volunteer movement by the <span class="roman">Convention Act</span> of 1793. The effect of this dictatorial measure was to throw into alliance with the United Irishmen those who, like Porter, were in favour of parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation, but were now debarred from holding open meetings for the encouragement of constitutional reforms.<br>
<br>In 1794 Porter became a contributor to the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, founded in 1792 by Samuel Neilson, and was involved with it until his death, acting briefly as editor during Neilson's imprisonment in 1797. For this paper he wrote anonymously a number of patriotic songs, which were afterwards reprinted in <span class="italic">Paddy's Resource</span>. Among his other songs were an attack on tithes and clerical subservience to government, and a song, &#145;The Rights of Man&#146;, set to the tune of &#145;God Save the King&#146;. In 1796 he contributed to the paper a famous series of seven letters by &#145;A Presbyterian&#146;, which were at once reprinted in Belfast as <span class="italic">Billy Bluff and Squire Firebrand</span>. This satire enjoyed much popularity in Ulster and was reprinted there until well into the twentieth century. The work was a satirical attack on the Irish aristocracy, their agents, and the system of local espionage employed in Ireland to control and observe potentially subversive elements. Having achieved widespread fame for his letters, Porter toured Ulster giving lectures on natural philosophy and science. The authorities suspected that his demonstrations were the pretext for the dissemination of the political principles of the United Irishmen.<br>
<br>In December 1796 Porter began another series of letters addressed, with the signature of Sydney, to the second marquess of Downshire. In these he vehemently attacked the policy of William Pitt, and the publication of the paper was for some time suspended by the authorities. On 16 February 1797, the government feast-day of thanksgiving for the storm which had dispersed the French fleet off Bantry Bay, Porter preached a sermon, which was published in Belfast as <span class="italic">Wind and Weather</span> (1797). This was an ironic work, suggested by the text, &#145;Ye walked according to &hellip; the prince of the power of the air&#146;  (<span class="roman">Ephesians</span> 2:2).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the rising of 1798 a large reward was offered for Porter's arrest. There is no evidence that he was aware of the rebels' plans, and his publications called for peaceable measures of constitutional reform. Nevertheless, he was arrested in June 1798 and taken first to Belfast and then to Newtownards for trial by court martial. He was charged with being one of a party of rebels who, between 9 and 11 June, had intercepted the mail between Belfast and Saintfield, co. Down, and had read a dispatch from the commanding officer at Belfast to a subordinate at Portaferry, co. Down. In fact, Porter had probably only read the dispatch aloud to assist the perpetrators, who were illiterate, and was almost certainly not involved in the actual seizure of the mail. Despite his own impressive appeal to the court, Porter was sentenced to be hanged and quartered.<br>
<br>Anna Porter's attempts to have her husband's execution suspended secured only the commuting of the order for quartering. Tradition states that she waylaid Lord Londonderry's carriage, but was ignored, Londonderry apparently being unable to forgive the depiction of him as Lord Mountmumble in <span class="italic">Billy Bluff</span>. Porter was executed on 2 July 1798, close to the road which led from his meeting-house to his home. At the gallows he sang the <span class="roman">35th psalm</span> and prayed; his wife was with him to the last. He was buried in the abbey churchyard at Greyabbey; a flat tombstone gives his age &#145;45 years&#146;. His wife died in Belfast on 3 November 1823. It is claimed that Porter's eldest son, Alexander, carried a stand of colours at the battle of Ballynahinch (12 June 1798) when he was fourteen, and that he fled to Tamna Wood, and was there recognized (but not betrayed). He later emigrated to Louisiana, of which state he became a senator, and he died there on 13 January 1844. Another son, James Porter, became attorney-general of Louisiana.<br>
