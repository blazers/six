<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yonge,  John</span>  (1466/7&#150;1516), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and diplomat</span>, was born at Heyford, Oxfordshire, a manor which belonged to New College, Oxford. Yonge later lived in Rye, Sussex. Nothing is known of his parents. When aged eleven he entered Winchester College as a scholar on 29 September 1478. He became a scholar of New College, Oxford, on 30 January 1484; from 1486 to 1500 he held a fellowship at New College and by 1494 he had taken the BCL degree. He went to Italy for further study. After living and studying in Bologna for some years, he was admitted in 1500 to the University of Ferrara, where he took the degree of DCL.<br>
<br>Yonge's education in the civil law and his foreign study provided him with the background needed to enter ecclesiastical administration and royal service. For some reason his career progressed slowly. He did not gain an important office until the age of thirty-seven when on 28 January 1504 William Warham, the recently appointed archbishop of Canterbury, made him a commissary in his prerogative court. Warham and Yonge had overlapped as fellows of New College and both were civilians. Later that same year Yonge went on his first diplomatic mission which involved negotiating a mercantile treaty with Archduke Philip of Austria, the ruler of the Low Countries. During 1506 Yonge participated in another mission concerning the terms of Henry VII's engagement to Margaret of Savoy. Meanwhile Yonge began to accumulate a rich collection of sinecures. On 17 March 1503 he acquired the rectory of St Stephen Walbrook, London, which was followed by the rectory of St Mary-le-Bow, London, which he held from 19 March 1505 to May 1514. On 19 February 1506 he became the warden of St John's Hospital in South Weald, Essex, and he was dean of Chichester by August 1507. Archbishop Warham continued to support Yonge and during August 1507 made him his diocesan chancellor and auditor of causes. The culmination of Yonge's success came on 22 January 1508 when Henry VII appointed him as master of the rolls, an office Warham, now lord chancellor, had held from 1494 to 1502. More diplomatic missions quickly followed. During July 1508 he went on a mission to Emperor Maximilian and during the following October he participated with Thomas Wolsey (who reported favourably on Yonge's performance) in the negotiations leading to the treaty of Cambrai. As a final tribute to his confidence in Yonge, in his will dated 10 April 1509 Henry VII named him as one of his executors.<br>
<br>Apparently recognizing a valuable servant, Henry VIII reappointed Yonge as master of the rolls on 11 June 1509. The king also continued to use him as a diplomat. From early August to 2 October 1511 Yonge travelled in the company of the Spanish ambassador as a special ambassador to Louis XII of France. On this occasion Wolsey judged Yonge to have been ineffectual. Apparently Wolsey's opinion was not yet paramount, since lucrative honours still followed such service. In November 1511 Yonge became a canon of St Paul's and a prebendary of Holborn, and on 11 February 1512 he added the prebendary of Newington in St Paul's, London. From 16 May 1512 to about April 1513 he went on a long mission to the Low Countries accompanied by Sir Thomas Boleyn. They negotiated with the emperor Maximilian, King Ferdinand of Spain, and the pope concerning the activities of the Holy League, their mutual alliance against France. He crossed over to Calais with Henry VIII's invading army on 11 March 1513. The following October he went on a mission concerning a proposed marriage between Henry VIII's sister Mary and Charles of Castile, the future king of Spain and Holy Roman emperor.<br>
<br>Yonge was obviously perceived as a person on his way up in England. On 1 January 1513 Erasmus dedicated a manuscript copy of his translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">De tuenda valetudine</span> and presented it to him as a new year gift. The edition printed by Richard Pynson of London in August 1513 bore the same dedication. More ecclesiastical offices followed his diplomatic labours. On 4 January 1513 he became dean of Newarke Hospital and College in Leicester, an office he held until December 1515 when he vacated it in return for a pension of &pound;20 per annum. In addition to acquiring more rectories, in 1514 Yonge became a canon of York; he quickly became dean of York and prebendary of Bugthorpe. He also acquired the archdeaconry of Barnstaple. More important, Yonge managed to gain the favourable attention of the rising Thomas Wolsey. When Wolsey became archbishop of York in mid-1514 he made Yonge his suffragan with the title of bishop of Negroponte.<br>
<br>Yonge appeared to have a bright future. On 4 April 1515 Henry VIII appointed him an envoy to renew the peace with Francis I of France. From there he proceeded to Tournai with a commission from the king authorizing him to organize the administration of that newly conquered city. But Yonge became seriously ill, and on 13 August 1515 Henry VIII gave him permission to return to England. Conscientiously, Yonge delayed his departure until 17 September in order to conclude his assignment. Back in London he died of the sweating sickness on 25 April 1516. Yonge was buried in the Rolls chapel, where an effigy by Pietro Torrigiano marks his tomb. It is probable that he would have climbed even higher in the government and the church if he had not died, prematurely and unmarried at the age of forty-nine.<br>
