<span class="headword">Gregory,  Arthur John Peter Michael Maundy</span>  (1877&#150;1941), <span class="occ">honours broker</span>, was born on 1 July 1877 at 9 Portland Terrace, Southampton, second of three sons of Francis Maundy Gregory (1849&#150;1899), clergyman, and his wife, Elizabeth Ursula Wynell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayow (1847&#150;1936), cousin of third Baron Lyveden. After attending Banister Court School for the sons of merchant marine officers, where he was nicknamed Bum Cheeks, he passed the Oxford University entrance examination and went into residence there as a non-collegiate student in 1895. Intended for holy orders, he left Oxford shortly before his finals and began appearing professionally as a drawing-room entertainer. During 1900 he acted in the theatrical company of Ben Greet; his first sizeable role was as a comic butler in a tour of <span class="italic">The Brixton Burglary</span> (1902). He became manager of Frank Benson's company (1903) but was dismissed for fraud (1906). In 1908 he made his earliest known attempt at blackmail. Harold Davidson, afterwards notorious as the vicar of Stiffkey, who had been his boyhood friend, induced Lord Howard de Walden and other rich men to finance Maundy-Gregory (as he then called himself) in the Combine Attractions Syndicate which crashed in 1909. Gregory next edited a gossip sheet, <span class="italic">Mayfair</span> (1910&#150;14). As a sideline he ran a detective agency specializing in credit rating based on information supplied by hoteliers and restaurateurs. Gregory claimed that after <span class="italic">Mayfair</span> folded he was engaged in espionage. Conscripted in July 1917, he became a private in the Irish Guards.<br>
<br>In 1918 Lord Murray of Elibank introduced Gregory to his successor as Liberal chief whip, Frederick Guest, as a potential intermediary between rich men who wanted honours and the Lloyd George coalition which needed money. Guest and his successor, Charles McCurdy, together with Lloyd George's press agent Sir William Sutherland, used Gregory as a tout to build up the Lloyd George political fund by the sale of honours. Between &pound;1 million and &pound;2 million were raised by this device in 1919&#150;22 (with Gregory receiving commission of perhaps &pound;30,000 a year). Knighthoods cost about &pound;10,000 and baronetcies &pound;40,000. Gregory occupied resplendent headquarters in Parliament Street replete with dispatch boxes and autographed photographs of royalty. As an accessory to this business Gregory in August 1919 founded the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette and St James's Review</span>, which masqueraded as a government publication and was circulated gratis on a mailing list of 1000; Gregory duped foreign embassies into paying for special supplements in the belief that they would be influential and also wrote puffing profiles of prominent men for a fee. His editorial policy was reactionary and antisemitic. He financed White Russian intrigues through his Anglo-Ukrainian Council and believed that his life was threatened by Comintern agents. However the outcry at the flagitiously corrupt birthday honours of 1922 precipitated the fall of the Lloyd George coalition. The <span class="roman">Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act</span> (1925) checked but did not stop Gregory's fouling of the fount of honour. J. C. C. Davidson, on becoming chairman of the Unionist Party in 1927, determined to break Gregory by excluding from all honours lists anyone known to have been a client of Gregory's. This slowly wrecked Gregory's credibility as an honours broker.<br>
<br>In 1927 Gregory acquired the Ambassador Club at 26 Conduit Street in London's Mayfair, where, with ingratiating flamboyance, he entertained prospective clients, collected gossip, and planted stories. He displayed a gold cigarette case given him by the duke of York, afterwards George VI, at whose wedding he was a steward. In 1929 Gregory bought <span class="italic">Burke's Landed Gentry</span>. In 1931 he leased Deepdene Hotel near Dorking, which became a favourite assignation for rich Londoners desiring a dirty weekend. As his traffic in British honours petered out, he diversified into the less profitable market of foreign decorations, and after being received into the Roman Catholic church in 1932 did brisk business in papal honours.<br>
<br>Gregory was confronted by the necessity in 1932&#150;3 to repay to the executors of Sir George Watson &pound;30,000 advanced for a barony never received. For a decade he had lived platonically with a tipsy retired musical actress, Mrs Edith Marion Rosse. She died mysteriously (14 September 1932) bequeathing &pound;18,000 to Gregory, who ensured her burial in an unsealed coffin only a few inches below the surface of a water-sodden cemetery on the banks of the Thames. Still desperate for funds Gregory rashly sought &pound;10,000 from Commander E. W. Billyard-Leake in return for procuring a knighthood. Following Billyard-Leake's complaint to the authorities, Gregory was arrested (4 February 1933). He initially pleaded not guilty, and political party organizers feared that he would air his activities together with the names of those implicated (half of the proceeds of Lloyd George's political fund had reached the Conservative Party). J. C. C. Davidson's organization accordingly approached him, warned that he could not avoid conviction, but undertook that if he kept silent the authorities would be lenient. After a discreet trial he changed his plea on 21 February and received the lightest possible sentence of two months and a fine of &pound;50. On his release from Wormwood Scrubs (12 April) he was met at the prison gates by a friend of Davidson who took him to France, gave him a down payment, and promised him an annual pension of &pound;2000. Rosse's corpse was exhumed (28 April 1933), but it was impossible to ascertain the cause of her death. Gregory did not return from France for her inquest, but was suspected of murder by some policemen.<br>
<br>Gregory was short, paunchy, bald, rubicund, monocled, and epicene. He wore ostentatious jewellery, including a green scarab ring he claimed had been Wilde's, and used to fidget with a rose-coloured diamond carried in his waistcoat pocket which supposedly had belonged to Catherine the Great. His manner was grandiose, mysterious, watchful, and confidential. Lord Birkenhead, whom he exploited in the late 1920s, interested him in rare books. His passion for collecting bronze, porcelain, and terracotta statues of the beautiful boy Narcissus indicates his sexual preferences. Arrested by the Germans in November 1940, Gregory was confined in their camp at Drancy, where his health deteriorated without the whisky upon which he depended. He died of cardiac failure, aggravated by a swollen liver, on 3 October (possibly 28 September) 1941, at Val de Gr&acirc;ce Hospital, Paris. He was buried in Ivry-Paris new cemetery, but five years later his bones were removed to an ossuary.<br>
