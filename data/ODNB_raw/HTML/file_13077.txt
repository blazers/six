<span class="headword">Hering,  George Edwards</span>  (1805&#150;1879), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in London, the younger son of Charles Ernest Christian Hering, a German bookbinder who belonged to the baronial family of von Heringen in Brunswick and who died when George was young. He was probably the child of that name baptized on 19 May 1805 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the son of Charles and Eliza Hering. He first worked in a bank but was soon permitted by his family to adopt art as his profession, and in 1829 he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste in Munich. His patron, Lord Erskine, travelled with him in the Tyrol, and sent him to Venice. After staying there for about two years, he travelled in Italy, and round the Adriatic Sea to Constantinople and Smyrna.<br>
<br>On his return to Rome, Hering became acquainted with John Paget and a Mr Sanford; together they toured the Carpathian mountains. While living in Rome, Hering met Bertel Thorvaldsen and Horace Vernet, and was able to bring together the antagonistic colonies of German and English artists in that city. Hering returned to England in 1836 and published <span class="italic">Sketches on the Danube, in Hungary and Transilvania</span> in 1838. He also illustrated Paget's <span class="italic">Hungary and Transylvania</span>, published in 1839. He settled in London, where for the rest of his life he practised as a landscape painter, though he continued to pay occasional visits to Italy. On 6 July 1839 he married Catherine, daughter of William Bromley, a solicitor. She was also an artist, and exhibited, as Mrs G. E. Hering, at the Royal Academy between 1840 and 1853. About 1850 the couple adopted a young girl, Marion Hamilton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58948/', "Acton, Marion Jean Catherine Adams-")</script>], whose mother gave her up for adoption to the Herings to improve her material and social position.<br>
<br>Hering habitually painted Italian landscapes with bright, cloudless skies, often highly finished. In 1836 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy, sending <span class="italic">The Ruins of the Palace of the C&aelig;sars, Rome</span>, and was a regular contributor thereafter to the academy and the British Institution, exhibiting landscapes of Rome, Naples, Genoa, Venice, La Spezia, Como, Piedmont, and Monte Rosa. In 1841 he exhibited a painting of Amalfi, which, through the agency of Samuel Rogers, was purchased by Prince Albert; it was engraved by Edward Goodall for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1856. He occasionally showed scenes of England, the Austrian Tyrol, and Greece, and Scotland became a frequent subject in the 1870s. In 1847 he published a set of twenty coloured lithographs, <span class="italic">The Mountains and Lakes of Switzerland, the Tyrol and Italy</span>.<br>
<br>George Edwards Hering died at his home, 45 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, London, on 18 December 1879; he was survived by his wife. Two sales of his works were held at Christies, London, on 7 May 1880 and 25 April 1881.<br>
