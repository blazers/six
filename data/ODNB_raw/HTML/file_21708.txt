<span class="headword">Pearson,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">Quaker administrator</span>, was baptized on 7 January 1627 at Cartmel Fell, Lancashire, the son of Edward Pearson. He may have studied law in London, though his name does not appear in the records of the inns of court. After becoming Sir Arthur Hesilrige's secretary in 1648, he was appointed judge advocate at Newcastle the following year to try officers and soldiers in northern garrisons for lesser offences, and clerk and registrar of the committee for compounding. He acquired the manors of Aspatria and Allerthwaite, Cumberland, in May 1650; Ramshaw Hall, near West Auckland, co. Durham, shortly thereafter; Marrowlee, Northumberland, in March 1653, and other estates seized from the marquess of Newcastle and Sir Thomas Riddell. He also managed Hesilrige's estates. On 10 February 1652 the committee for compounding appointed him sequestration commissioner for co. Durham, and the following month he became a JP for Cumberland and Westmorland. By 1652 he had married Grace, daughter of Thomas and Grace Lamplough of Ribton Hall, Cumberland.<br>
<br>George Fox described Pearson as &#145;a great persecutor of ffreindes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.108), but at the sessions in Appleby, Westmorland, in January 1653 he was moved by the testimony of James Nayler. On a visit to the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell, he met Fox, and he also received letters from Howgill and Margaret Fell urging him to become a Friend. In a missive to the latter dated 9 May 1653 he described his spiritual condition, seeking guidance from Fox and Nayler. Although he had considered himself a devout man, he now likened his state to that of a battered vessel, devoid of pilot or rudder. &#145;All my Religion was but the heareinge of the Eare, the beleeveinge and talkeinge of a god &amp; christ in heaven or a place at a distance I knowe not where&#146;  (Swarthmore MSS, 1.87). He was probably convinced in the ensuing weeks, for Thomas Aldam and Richard Farnworth held meetings at his house in early June, and Nayler visited him in July, holding a meeting at which hundreds became Quakers. Pearson took his wife to meet Fox at Bootle, Cumberland, and subsequently travelled with Fox to Carlisle, where he and Gervase Benson defended Fox when the latter was imprisoned. On 3 October 1653 Pearson wrote an address <span class="italic">To the Parliament of the Common-Wealth of England</span>, placing responsibility for persecution on parliament, listing three dozen Quakers who had been persecuted in Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Westmorland, denouncing those responsible as tyrants, and disparaging &#145;the broken Cisterns of Universities and humane Studies&#146;  (p. 7).<br>
<br>Pearson may have been the &#145;A. Peirson&#146; who was serving in Scotland as a commissioner for the administration of justice in December 1653, and he was still active as a sequestration commissioner in April 1654. In March 1654 he welcomed Fox to Ramshaw Hall, which became the base of Quaker operations in Durham, and in May he helped establish the first monthly meeting in Durham. Shortly thereafter he went to London, where he and Howgill were concerned about relations with Ranters. In <span class="italic">A Few Words to All Judges, Justices, and Ministers of the Law</span> (acquired by the bookseller George Thomason on 16 July 1654), he denounced the use of oaths, capital punishment, and compulsory tithing, adding that if tithes must be collected, they should be used to relieve the indigent and eradicate poverty. On 16 July he met with Oliver Cromwell, telling him that the civil wars had been for the benefit of the spiritual &#145;seed&#146;, that the protector had been chosen to overthrow oppression, and that the law prohibiting the disruption of church services was unjust. When he also attempted at the meeting to convert Cromwell's associates, Cromwell dismissed him, prompting Pearson to conclude that the lord protector was neither honest nor tender-hearted. When Pearson found Londoners difficult to convince, particularly &#145;rude savage apprentices and young people and Ranters&#146;, he advised Fox to send only mature Friends to London in search of converts  (Barclay, 13). In September 1654 he met with John Wildman and other dissidents, but he apparently had no interest in opposing the protectorate. The following month he obtained an order for Aldam's release from York prison after meeting with the attorney-general, the treasury commissioners, the barons of the exchequer, and Cromwell.<br>
<br>Pearson and Aldam then mounted a concerted effort to obtain the release of other Friends. In April 1655 they wrote to Cheshire magistrates, protesting their treatment of Quakers, and in May, Pearson, Aldam, and Benson presented Cromwell with documents concerning imprisoned Friends. Pearson and Benson continued to collect information about Friends in northern England who had been prosecuted for refusing to remit tithes. During the ensuing months he travelled in Wales, Shropshire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, and Lancashire, where he was briefly incarcerated at Manchester. With Major-General Charles Worsley presiding, on 4 March 1656 he, Audland, Alexander Parker, Thomas Lawson, and others engaged in a debate with ministers at Preston. Tension with other Quakers, however, occurred as early as May, when William Caton chided Pearson for failing to assist Scottish Friends purchase a meeting-house in Edinburgh, and in July Lancelot Wardell accused him of preventing the publication of a document about the persecution of Durham Quakers. In a lengthy dispute with Wardell over finances, he had the support of Margaret Fell and George Taylor. He reported the notorious trial of Nayler, with whose convictions (though not actions) he concurred, to Fox in November. More controversy erupted in May 1657 when John Lilburne, now a Quaker, accused Pearson of conveying the title to some of Lilburne's property to Pearson's wife, Grace.<br>
<br>During the spring of 1657 Pearson supported the creation of a fund to support Friends who travelled in the ministry. He and Howgill nominated Quakers throughout England and Wales to serve as treasurers, a post he and George Adamson undertook for Durham. His principal work, <span class="italic">The Great Case of Tythes</span>, appeared in 1657 and reached a third edition two years later, with four more following in the eighteenth century. His examination of tithing among the biblical Jews and in the history of the church persuaded him that they were not required by divine law, equity, monarchical grants, parliamentary statute, or the rights of those who had purchased impropriated tithes, though he supported compensation for improprietors. The termination of tithing, he argued, would stop ceaseless lawsuits, provide incentives to raise more crops, and relieve the people of an oppressive burden. Immanuel Bourne offered a rebuttal in <span class="italic">A Defence and Justification of Ministers Maintenance by Tythes</span> (1659).<br>
<br>In the late 1650s Pearson helped establish Quaker business meetings in the north and was active on behalf of persecuted Friends, attracting the attention of George Monck in Scotland, who was concerned by his proselytizing. With Fox, Pearson conferred with the aldermen of Newcastle in 1657, and early the following year he arranged a meeting between Fox and Sir Henry Vane at Raby Castle, but the latter would have ousted Fox as &#145;a mad man&#146; had Pearson not been present  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.314). On 24 June 1658 Pearson, Aldam, and forty-one others endorsed the establishment of a fund to support Quaker missions. The same year Pearson and nineteen others submitted a declaration to the council of state defending Quaker tenets, seeking the release of 115 imprisoned co-religionists, and protesting against high legal fees, lengthy delays, and attorneys' greed.<br>
<br>Amid the unsettled conditions in 1659, Pearson and fifteen others signed <span class="italic">A Declaration of the People of God</span>, including a list of potential JPs, among them Pearson, who had been removed from the commission of the peace by 1657. On 22 June he and Caton told Fell they were hopeful that parliament might undertake needed reform, and five days later Pearson and nineteen others presented parliament with a petition against tithes bearing 15,000 signatures. Because of Pearson's growing involvement in politics, once again as an associate of Hesilrige, Howgill shunned him in August. Although appointed a militia commissioner that month, he reportedly refused to wear a sword, yet he disarmed royalists and reputedly would have raised men to help John Lambert suppress Booth's rebellion had local JPs and commissioners not been reluctant. With other Durham Friends he signed a letter in October expressing concern about Fox's plan to establish quarterly sessions based on counties and proposing that funds raised by meetings be used to assist all needy Friends, not just those engaged in ministerial activities.<br>
<br>The government received a report in June 1660 that at least 100 Quakers met almost nightly at Ramshaw Hall, and that Pearson had recently received a substantial shipment of knives and daggers, but he was not arrested until December 1661, when he went to London in supposed violation of a proclamation banning cashiered soldiers from within 20 miles of the city. Suspected of maintaining contacts with dissidents in Scotland, he denied the accusation and likewise insisted he had not commanded troops at the time of Booth's insurrection. On 9 January he renounced his self-described religious excesses (&#145;the Chymericall Notion of those giddy tymes&#146;), averred that he had always befriended the king's servants and sequestered clergy, and claimed that his change of heart had occurred many years earlier through the influence of Sir William Darcy when it was &#145;neither seasonable nor serviceable to discover it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/49/27). As proof of his sincerity, he had voluntarily returned the estates of Newcastle and Riddell, surrendered his weapons, and pledged allegiance to the king. After his release on 16 January 1662, he offered advice to the government on 2 July 1663 concerning trade between England and Scotland. He was appointed under-sheriff of Durham by Bishop John Cosin on 2 March 1664, and in 1665 he was involved in a dispute over Cosin's appropriation of Vane's personal estate. After embracing the Anglican faith, Pearson died, probably in Durham and from the plague, on 23 January 1666, and was buried the next day at St Mary-the-Less, Durham. On 26 September 1673 his widow married the Quaker James Hall of Monk Hesleden, Durham.<br>
