<span class="headword">O'Cahan, Sir  Donnell  Ballagh</span> <span class="st"> [Domhnall  Ballach &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1626?), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, himself illiterate, was fostered in the household of Turlough Luineach O'Neill, and was the eldest son of Rory O'Cahan, being chosen (<i>doirdnead</i>, &#145;was ordained&#146;; <span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1598), after the latter's death on 14 April 1598, to succeed as lord of O'Cahan's country, which took in much of the modern co. Londonderry, in Ulster. His principal castle and demesne lands were near Limavady. The military might of O'Cahan was estimated variously, with figures of 140 horse and 400 foot being sometimes exceeded. O'Cahan was O'Neill's principal <i>uriaght</i>, or vassal, and had a special role in the O'Neill inauguration ceremony.<br>
<br>Donnell O'Cahan succeeded during the Nine Years' War, in which he participated, and was to be the last O'Cahan lord in the Gaelic order. His role in the war was mainly a local one, and after Sir Henry Docwra was placed at Derry in 1600, he made a number of incursions into O'Cahan's country and took Enagh Castle in June 1601. In June 1602 O'Cahan sought negotiations with Sir Arthur Chichester, then bringing military pressure on him from Carrickfergus, and on 27 July Docwra procured his submission and consequent desertion of the O'Neill cause, itself weakened by the earlier Spanish failure at Kinsale. By its terms, approved by Lord Deputy Mountjoy, he should receive title under the crown to much of the lordship, but surrender significant parts, principally a substantial area opposite Derry, the castle at Coleraine, an area at Dungiven, and certain fishing rights. He received a grant of the custody of the restored land, but not an outright patent, on 20 October following, and, on 21 October, a pardon to himself, his then wife, Rosa, a daughter of Hugh O'Neill (formerly married to Hugh Roe O'Donnell), his family, chaplain, and other followers, and the inhabitants of O'Cahan's country. Thereafter he supported the English side with his forces.<br>
<br>However, in the pacification of Ulster after 1603 (Mountjoy's final strategy), O'Neill was restored as earl of Tyrone, with the lands granted to him to include O'Cahan country. O'Cahan, still wanting independent ownership, felt betrayed by Docwra, the local commander, and by Mountjoy, who had now secured his recall. In addition, his relations soon deteriorated with O'Neill, who sought O'Cahan's full compliance. On 17 February 1607 O'Cahan reached an agreement with Tyrone whereby he should hold in freehold under him, but claim no other right or title, paying an annual rent of 200 cows, the easterly lands &#145;from the mountain [Slieve Gullion] to the Bann&#146; to be held by the earl as assurance for its payment, and with O'Neill to arbitrate any disputes between O'Cahan and &#145;his gentlemen and followers&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1606&#150;8</i>, 110&#150;11). However, on 4 March George Montgomery, the recently appointed bishop of Derry, whose primary aim was to secure title to the extensive termon lands as temporalities for the Church of Ireland, reported to Dublin that O'Cahan, desiring not to be in &#145;thrall if he might be free&#146;, still sought separate title under the crown, provided his country were not divided like Monaghan, &#145;of which he had some fear&#146;  (ibid., 125). The &#145;settlement&#146; of Monaghan in 1591 had abolished MacMahon lordly power there by diffusing ownership among the heads of competing branches, and the Dublin government under Sir Arthur Chichester, wishing to extend its rule over the larger northern lords and reduce their power, had revived that settlement there in 1606.<br>
<br>In May 1607 O'Cahan, encouraged by Montgomery, initiated a suit against Tyrone before the lord deputy and council. He claimed longstanding ancestral possession of O'Cahan's country, insisting that the O'Cahan obligation to the O'Neills had been essentially that of military service&#151;with 100 horse and 300 foot&#151;together with an annual tribute of twenty-one cows, and requested a separate patent of the entire area. Tyrone answered with an assertion that there was no such thing as O'Cahan's country, insisting that the O'Cahans had always been O'Neill tenants at sufferance, and, requesting a new patent to himself, appealed in like terms to the king. At hearing, the case became acrimonious with Tyrone snatching and tearing up a document of O'Cahan's, and a temporizing order was made, to be subject to royal instructions on the matter: O'Cahan should hold two-thirds and the earl one-third, namely the Maghery region in the south-east. O'Cahan was also knighted in Dublin on 28 June 1607.<br>
<br>However, since both sought recourse to the king, so now London was plied with recommendations for a thoroughgoing settlement of landownership conducive to more effective rule and revenue raising. Montgomery, concerned for the security of himself and others at the remote outpost at Derry, recommended favour to O'Cahan, but also that he should be separated from O'Neill, as O'Doherty had been from O'Donnell, and retain to himself a substantial scope of land sufficient to be a baron, with more to be granted to the English military men who had stayed on since the war. The attorney-general, Sir John Davies, visualized a radical outcome which would reduce the landownership of both O'Cahan and O'Neill in tandem. Relying on the act of attainder of Shane O'Neill in 1569, he argued that present titles could be questioned, and ownership not only be dispersed among lesser Irish figures but, crucially, a body of new English proprietors be introduced also. Were this opportunity not taken, and O'Neill in particular not reduced to the &#145;moderate condition of other lords in Ireland and in England at this day&#146;, then there would be &#145;no commonwealth in Ulster&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1606&#150;8</i>, 212&#150;13). In July the king decided that both should go to England in the autumn for a final determination in his presence, with Davies in attendance. The flight of the earls in September 1607 put paid to such potentialities and left O'Cahan in uncertainty. In the atmosphere of mutual suspicion and fear of conspiracy that followed, he kept distant from those placed in authority locally, and was absent when Davies, in preparation for plantation, brought about Tyrone's indictment at Strabane at the end of the year. On the view of London that he might &#145;shake the rod&#146;  (ibid., 399), Chichester had him arrested and brought to Dublin in February 1608. It was not surprising, he thought, that O'Cahan and others were inconstant and wavering because their priests assured them that the earls would return to renew warfare, and in March he was advised not to release him &#145;considering the corner he dwells in&#146;  (ibid., 434).<br>
<br>After delays due to other business, O'Doherty's rising and vacillation, O'Cahan was indicted on six charges of treason, some deriving from evidence from ambitious relatives, including one that he had both intended to accompany O'Neill in flight and to join with him if he returned with foreign forces. When the parallel case against Niall Garbh O'Donnell, begun in June 1609, looked unlikely to secure a conviction, that against O'Cahan was deferred pending further instructions from London, and on 31 July a royal warrant was issued for both to be sent to England. He was dispatched, with the charges against him, at the end of October and placed in the Tower of London. From there, in 1610, he presented petitions against his confinement, denying complicity with O'Neill, and, in an impoverished state, tried in 1613 to raise income from cattle dispersed among now unresponsive followers, but did not gain his release. His incarceration eliminated a potential focus of opposition to plantation, and ensured that in the distinctive co. Londonderry plantation that followed from 1610, the Irish were restored to less land than in the other Ulster planted counties.<br>
<br>O'Cahan's marriage to O'Neill's daughter fell victim to their dispute. His first wife, probably, was Mary, daughter of Sir Hugh MacManus O'Donnell, Lord of Tirconnell; she subsequently married Sir Teig O'Rourke. His second wife (even possibly his first liaison), and the mother of his sons, was Honora, herself an O'Cahan by birth. Donnell reverted to her after his third, and political, marriage to Rosa O'Neill broke down, and thus it was Honora who was referred to as O'Cahan's wife by the English privy council in September 1613. Honora was in London in 1613, and she and their sons, Rory and Donnell, were allocated land in freehold under the Londoners in 1611. Rory took part in an abortive plot in 1615, with the aim, it was alleged, of overthrowing the plantation in its infancy by burning some of the new settlements while saving a number of its leading figures as hostages for the release of his father and other Ulster prisoners, and was executed after conviction at the Derry assizes on 31 July 1615. Sir Donnell died in the Tower, probably in August 1626, and appears to have been buried there on 11 August.<br>
