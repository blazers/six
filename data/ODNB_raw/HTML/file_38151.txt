<span class="headword">Woods,  Samuel Moses James</span>  (1867&#150;1931), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Glenfield, near Sydney, Australia, on 4 April 1867, fourth son in the family of five sons and seven daughters of John Woods and his wife, Margaret. His parents came from co. Antrim and, after their marriage in 1853, decided to seek their fortune in Australia. John Woods prospered in business and settled in Sydney, where Sammy received his first education at Royston College and Sydney grammar school. He soon developed a passion for cricket: his most remarkable feat at school was to take seven wickets in seven balls.<br>
<br>Their father took Sammy Woods and a younger brother, Harris, to Britain in 1884, when Sammy was sixteen. He went to Silwood House School in Tunbridge Wells and on to Brighton College. There his all-round sporting prowess flowered from a base provided for him by a banker friend of his father's, Gilbert Burrington of Bridgwater, who became in effect Sammy's guardian. It is not clear how he got into Cambridge in 1888 for he was, notoriously, not at all bookish and had been turned down by Oxford. After four years' residence&#151;&#145;four of the jolliest years of my life&#146;  (Woods, 30)&#151;he left the university without taking a degree (1891). But as an undergraduate at Jesus College he had an immediate impact on university cricket, winning four cricket blues and playing a decisive role in three Cambridge victories. He took thirty-six wickets at an average of less than 9 and Oxford scarcely managed an innings over 100 in any of the matches in which he played. While still an undergraduate he played three test matches for Australia against England (1888) and eight matches for the Gentlemen v. the Players. In 1891, playing for Cambridge, he took fourteen Surrey wickets for 11 runs each. His rugby football prowess was also outstanding; he was a Cambridge rugby blue 1888&#150;90, and played thirteen times for England between 1890 and 1895, leading England to the triple crown as captain in 1895.<br>
<br>It is as a Somerset cricketer that Woods is now best remembered. Between 1886 and 1910 he played in 299 matches for the county. He, virtually alone, ensured first-class status for Somerset and led them through their difficult early years. He scored 12,637 runs for his county, took 556 wickets, and was a brilliant fielder. Many of his finest performances were against the best sides, notably Yorkshire, Surrey, and Sussex: in 1895 he scored 215 against Sussex in two and a half hours. He played three tests for England in South Africa in 1895&#150;6, thus joining the small band of men who have played test cricket for more than one country. He toured abroad under Lord Hawke to America twice, South Africa, and the West Indies. One of the greatest amateur fast bowlers during cricket's &#145;golden age&#146; at the turn of the twentieth century, with a deadly yorker and a deceptive slower delivery, he had career statistics of 1040 wickets (at 20.82) and 15,345 runs (at 23.42).<br>
<br>Woods was famous for his sportsmanship (he loathed draws and always went for a win), his courage, his cheerful manner, and, standing over 6 feet tall and weighing 13&frac12; stone, his fine physique. Gilbert Jessop called him &#145;the personification of pluck and good fellowship&#146;  (Woods, 6). His inability to settle down to a gainful occupation which would support him as an amateur player caused Somerset to appoint him assistant secretary, at a salary of &pound;200 a year, in 1898. His playing career was ended by arthritis in 1911. At the outbreak of the First World War he was in his forty-eighth year and had difficulty persuading the army to take him. Eventually a friend at headquarters got him a commission in the Somerset light infantry; later he was transferred to the 20th Devons and served in the labour corps. Somerset made him club secretary in 1920. Paperwork was not his forte and an outcry among the members following an increase in subscriptions to meet a deficit led to his resignation in 1923 to make way for a new secretary &#145;with a business-like head&#146;  (Roebuck, 141).<br>
<br>Gradually Woods's accumulated injuries began to afflict him. Arthritis was made worse by the heavy drinking he so much enjoyed. Having no real home, he took rooms in pubs and hotels in Taunton and reputedly drank a bottle of whisky a day to alleviate his pain. His conviviality was unimpaired, however, and his stock of anecdotes and capacity to entertain never ran dry. He was a familiar sight in the streets of Taunton chatting with friends and often surrounded by children. Robertson-Glasgow said that everyone loved Sammy &#145;for the whole world's manliness and generosity seemed to have gathered in his heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">46 Not Out</span>, 1948, 129). Yet he had very few close relationships and, though fond of female company, he never married. Early in 1931 a London specialist diagnosed inoperable cancer of the oesophagus. Woods died in Taunton on 30 April 1931 and was buried on 4 May in St Mary's cemetery, Taunton, within sight of his beloved Quantock hills. A superb sportsman, without swagger, Woods &#145;was just a big man child&#146;  (Roebuck, 38).<br>
