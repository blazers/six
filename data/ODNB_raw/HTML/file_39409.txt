<span class="headword">Gardner,  Monica Mary</span>  (1873&#150;1941), <span class="occ">writer on Poland and Polish literature</span>, was born on 26 June 1873 at Subiaco Lodge, Roehampton Lane, London, the fifth of the six children of John Gardner (1839&#150;1887), a stockjobber, and his wife, Amy Vernon, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garratt (<i>d</i>. 1937). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65483/', "(John) Edmund Garratt Gardner (1869&#150;1935)")</script> was her brother. Monica Gardner, who was a devout Roman Catholic (her originally Anglican parents having converted), was educated at the Sacred Heart Convent, Roehampton Lane. Her interest in Poland originated while she was still at school, when she participated in a competition in which each entrant had to write an essay on a favourite historical figure. Having chosen to write on Bonnie Prince Charlie, she discovered that his mother, Clementina Sobieska, was Polish and so decided to probe further into Polish history. Subsequently she decided to teach herself Polish and, with the assistance of Edmund Naganowski (1853&#150;1915), a Polish writer and Anglophile who lived in England from 1899 to 1903, became sufficiently proficient to read Polish books.<br>
<br>Monica Gardner began publishing articles on Polish literature and soon became the leading British scholar in the field. Her ability to make full use of critical studies in Polish, already manifest in her first book, <span class="italic">Adam Mickiewicz: the National Poet of Poland</span> (1911), was the more impressive in view of her complete lack of academic training. She published at least seven more books including <span class="italic">Poland: a Study in National Idealism</span> (1915), <span class="italic">The Anonymous Poet of Poland: Zygmunt Krasi&#324;ski</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">The Patriot Novelist of Poland: Henryk Sienkiewicz</span> (1926), and many articles and translations. Writing for an audience unfamiliar with the authors under discussion, she did not aspire to scholarly analysis, but as a pioneer introducing Polish literature to the English-speaking public she was unequalled in her lifetime. Although her commitment to the Polish cause was uncompromising and her enthusiasm was said to be &#145;sometimes bordering on exaltation&#146;  (Krajewska, 52), in literary matters she was capable of impartial discernment.<br>
<br>Monica Gardner never married. During the 1920s and 1930s she lived with her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65483/', "Edmund Garratt Gardner (1869&#150;1935)")</script>, a distinguished scholar of Italian literature, and their mother at 5 Ruskin Close, Meadway, London. Accompanied by Edmund she spent a few weeks in Poland in August and September 1922, visiting Pozna&#324; and Cracow. This was probably her only visit to the country to which she devoted her life's work, but there is slender evidence to suggest a second brief visit in 1930. Her house in London was a well-known port of call for Polish visitors, and she corresponded with many prominent Poles, including the statesman Roman Dmowski, the composer Feliks Nowowiejski, the poet Kazimiera I&#322;&#322;akowicz&oacute;wna, and the literary historians Wac&#322;aw Borowy, Julian Krzy&#380;anowski, and Roman Dyboski. In 1927 the cross of officer of the order of Polonia Restituta was conferred on her by the president of the republic of Poland and she was elected to membership of the literary history commission of the Polska Akademia Umiej&#281;tno&#347;ci (Polish Academy of Sciences) in Cracow. In appearance she was tall and angular with looks that were distinctive and intelligent but without pretension to either elegance or beauty. She had rather thin wispy hair, which she wore in a bun, kept up precariously by hairpins. Though austere in face and manner, she was neither intolerant nor intimidating. One account describes her as having &#145;the face of a visionary&#146;  (Kuncewiczowa, 121). She looked not unlike Virginia Woolf, to whom she was distantly related.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, and especially after the establishment of the Polish government in London in 1940, Gardner's work acquired a new topicality and she was much in demand. She was working on an English translation of O. Halecki's <span class="italic">History of Poland</span> (1942). Her family and friends pleaded with her, in view of the German air raids, to leave London, but she refused, asserting that her Polish interests kept her in London and that her literary work was her way of fighting Hitler. &#145;This is my war work&#146;, she used to say. She was killed in the early hours of 17 April 1941 by a German land-mine falling on the house where she was then living at 8 Fellows Road, Hampstead, London. Some of her possessions, including books and manuscripts, were recovered from the ruins by her friend Mary Corbridge-Patkaniowska, who completed the translation of Halecki and saw it through the press, but the manuscript of a book on the poet Juliusz S&#322;owacki, which Monica Gardner was known to have been writing, was never found. The funeral, arranged by the Polish embassy with almost military honours, took place on 23 April in the presence of representatives of the Polish government, including the president. She was buried at Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, London.<br>
