<span class="headword">Thomas,  William</span>  (1592/3&#150;1667), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was probably born at Whitchurch, Shropshire. He was almost certainly educated locally before being admitted as a plebeian scholar to Brasenose College, Oxford, on 1 December 1609, aged sixteen. He graduated BA on 8 February 1613 and, having proceeded MA on 17 June 1615, was instituted rector of the church at Ubley, Somerset on 4 January 1618. By 1627, when his only surviving child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27238/', "Samuel Thomas (1626/7&#150;1693)")</script>, was born, he had met and married his wife, Thomasine.<br>
<br>Thomas's entire adult life was directed by an uncompromising adherence to godly religion. During the 1620s he became a well-known lecturer in Somerset and he was rewarded in 1633 when he was granted licence to preach throughout the diocese of Bath and Wells. Almost immediately, however, he was in serious trouble with the diocesan authorities. In October 1634 he was suspended for refusing to read the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, a sentence confirmed on 23 June 1635. Five days later he was removed from his living and excommunicated for three years. Subsequently he was reinstated by Archbishop William Laud after a petition from colleagues in Somerset. Edward Chetwynd, dean of Bristol and renowned godly preacher, named Thomas in his will of November 1638 as a &#145;dear friend&#146;. Despite his reinstatement, however, by the outbreak of civil war Thomas was an embittered opponent of the Stuart church.<br>
<br>During the royalist occupation of Somerset between July 1643 and March 1645 Thomas was prevented from preaching. Frustrated, he took the covenant and fled to London, becoming a regular preacher in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane. In August 1645 he was named as rector of the parish, and the same year he became a trier for the second classis, a position which he held until early 1646. Encouraged by his success he returned to Somerset and became minister at the church of St Cuthbert, Wells, before April 1646. In 1647 he helped to establish nine &#145;classes&#146; in the county, and in the following year signed an attestation of ministers wishing to establish presbyterian government in Somerset. Thomas's circle included his neighbour Samuel Crooke of Wrington, at whose funeral on 3 January 1650 he delivered an exhortation, subsequently published by Thomas and John Chetwynd in <span class="italic">The Dead Saint Speaking</span> (1653). Thomas may also have been the W. T. who contributed a Latin epitaph to W. G., <span class="italic">Anthologia: the Life and Death of Mr Samuel Crooke</span> (1651).<br>
<br>During the interregnum Thomas built a schoolhouse in his birthplace of Whitchurch. He strove to promote moral reformation and to arrest the spread of Independents who claimed to be &#145;more perfect saints&#146;  (Underdown, 146) and in 1654 he assisted the Somerset committee for the ejection of scandalous ministers. During 1656 and 1657 he published three passionate refutations of the work of the Bristol Quaker Thomas Speed, principally over Speed's uses of scripture, preaching, and the question of tithes. Progressively, however, Thomas devoted more of his time to scholarship. He frequently corresponded with the Worcestershire divine Richard Baxter, and reportedly sent his son, Samuel, to Baxter for a disputation over the nature of free will. He was reputed to have assembled volumes of &#145;Anniversaria&#146;, or diaries of comments on events, and more specialized works of &#145;Aegrotorum visitationes&#146; and &#145;Meditationes vespertinae&#146; on particular subjects.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Thomas continued to preach at Ubley and considered the establishment of philanthropic projects. His <span class="italic">Christian and Conjugal Counsell &hellip; Applyed unto the Maried Estate</span> appeared in 1661 and <span class="italic">A Preservative of Piety</span>, a manual for the Christian household, the following year. By then, however, he was again in trouble with authority. When asked his view of the prayer book he remarked that &#145;I bless God, it is so good, but yet it might be better&#146;, for which he was ejected on 21 August 1662  (<span class="italic">VCH Somerset</span>, 2.52&#150;3). In 1666, he took the Oxford oath, which, by forbidding his coming within 5 miles of any town or city, effectively ended his preaching career, although he has been credited as the author of <span class="italic">The Counties Sense of Londons Sufferings</span> (1667), an application of lessons from the <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> of Jeremiah to the great fire of 1666. Subsequently his health declined, and his final days were spent at Ubley, where he died on 15 November 1667, probably survived by his wife. Perhaps fittingly, his will of 24 April that year bequeathed 50<i>s</i>. to the parish church which he had served so faithfully and controversially, together with lands in trust for the Whitchurch schoolhouse. He was buried at Ubley, where his son erected a monument in his memory. The future bishop George Bull of St David's, who had lodged in Thomas's household during the 1650s, uncharitably recorded that he had &#145;received little or no improvement or assistance from him in the study of theology&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). However, Thomas's request to his executors (who included John Chetwynd) to publish some of his writings bore fruit in <span class="italic">Practical Piety, or, The Pastor's Last Legacy</span> (1681), which testifies to a lasting reputation among some of the godly.<br>
