<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Henry</span>  (1616/17&#150;1690), <span class="occ">college head and ejected minister</span>, was the son of William Wilkinson, curate or chaplain of Adwick-le-Street, Yorkshire, where he was born. John Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 1650), principal of Magdalen Hall and president of Magdalen College, Oxford, was his uncle. After studying under John Langly in Gloucester and Edward Sylvester in Oxford, Henry matriculated at Magdalen Hall on 10 October 1634 aged seventeen. His tutor was Dr Henry Wilkinson, later canon of Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated BA on 28 November 1635, proceeded MA on 26 May 1638, and became tutor and dean of his college.<br>
<br>When the civil war started Wilkinson left Oxford, joined the Westminster assembly, and became a popular preacher. He became lecturer or minister of Buckminster, Leicestershire, in 1642; lecturer at Carfax church, Oxford, on 10 October 1642 (albeit that he was hardly in a position to exercise while the town was the royalist headquarters); and vicar of Epping, Essex, on 30 October 1643, upon the sequestration of Martin Holbeach. He was appointed a parliamentary visitor of Oxford University on 1 May 1647. Created BD on 14 April 1648 he became fellow and vice-president of Magdalen College on 25 May, principal of Magdalen Hall on 12 August, and Whyte's professor of moral philosophy on 24 March 1649. He was known as Dean Harry, to distinguish him from his former tutor. A strong parliamentarian, Wilkinson signed the Essex &#145;Testimony &hellip; to the solemn league and covenant&#146; (1648) and entertained Oliver Cromwell and his commanders at Magdalen Hall on 19 May 1649. Preaching before them next day he &#145;prayed hard for the army&#146;  (Bloxam, 2.cviii).<br>
<br>In 1652 Wilkinson was created DD and was elected prebendary of Worcester Cathedral, though he was never installed. Wilkinson's wife, Elizabeth (1612/13&#150;1654) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66353/', "Wilkinson, Elizabeth")</script>], the daughter of Anthony Gifford of Devon, died on 8 December 1654, and on 4 September 1655 he married Anne Benson (<i>d</i>. 1698) of Hackney, Middlesex. On 27 May 1658 the council of state voted him a salary of &pound;60 for his Carfax lectureship. Reputed for his scholarship he catalogued the Magdalen Hall Library (published in 1661), published six Latin sermons and treatises between 1654 and 1660, and regularly preached in the university church. He fervently pleaded presbyterian reform against all &#145;prophane&#146; influences: rising Socinianism; Antinomian &#145;spirits&#146; and unordained sectarians who were &#145;self-conceited Seducers&#146;; and Arminians, who were a blend of Jesuits and superficial protestants. Wilkinson was fearless. In 1660 he offended returning episcopal powers with his <span class="italic">Three Decads of Sermons</span> urging readers not to &#145;hanker after superstitious Ceremonies, a formal Service Book, [or] a Lordly Prelacy&#146;.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Wilkinson's petition to remain in place was successful (29 March 1661), but in September the chancellor of the university, the earl of Clarendon, chided Wilkinson for the nonconformity of Magdalen, complaining that it contained only &#145;factious and debauched persons&#146;. Wilkinson was ejected from his livings by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in August 1662, though some university officials desired to retain him because he was a good disciplinarian. He preached at Buckminster, Leicestershire, until he was gaoled on erroneous charges of complicity in the Farnley Wood plot. Upon release, in September 1665, he settled at Gosfield, Essex, when, between the tenures of Thomas Wardener and Henry Elliot (1669&#150;72), apparently he officiated at the parish church. An entry in the visitation book of the archdeaconry for 9 June 1671 notes his citation for reading divine service not according to the rubric. On 19 July he was pronounced contumacious and was excommunicated.<br>
<br>After Charles II's declaration of indulgence he got licences, dated 16 May 1672, for himself as a presbyterian teacher at Gosfield and for his house as a presbyterian meeting-house. When these were revoked he wrote to Anthony Wood in Oxford, in July 1672, seeking employment as a Latin translator to eke out a living. In 1673 or 1674 he moved to Sible Hedingham, Essex, where his library was distrained on his refusing to pay the fine for unlawful preaching. Afterwards he occasionally relied on charity from patrons such as Mary Rich, countess of Warwick, to sustain him. His last years were in Suffolk: at Great Cornard near Sudbury (1680), and at Castle Honingham (1690). He died on 13 May 1690 and was buried on the 15th at Milding, near Lavenham. His widow, Anne, moved to Dedham, Essex, where she lived with her daughter, Martha, the wife of the vicar, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4033/', "William Burkitt")</script>, until her death in November 1698.<br>
