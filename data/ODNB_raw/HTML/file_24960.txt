<span class="headword">Scrope,  Henry</span>, ninth Baron Scrope of Bolton  (1533/4&#150;1592), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the second, but eldest surviving, son of John Scrope, eighth Baron Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1549), and Lady Katherine Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1598), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5647/', "Henry Clifford, first earl of Cumberland")</script>. His father took part in the Pilgrimage of Grace, but in 1548 was serving in Protector Somerset's army in Scotland in command of 200 foot. His son may have accompanied the expedition, but there is no other evidence of early military service. He married, first, Mary North (<i>d</i>. 1558), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20300/', "Edward North, first Baron North")</script>, with whom he had a daughter Mary, who herself married William Bowes of Streatlam, near Barnard Castle. His second wife, whom he married before 10 September 1565, was Lady Margaret Howard (<i>d</i>. 1591), daughter of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13905/', "Henry Howard, styled earl of Surrey")</script>. They had two sons, Thomas and Henry.<br>
<br>The ninth baron was summoned to parliament from 1555 to 1589. In 1556 he was instructed to assist the president of the council of the north, the earl of Shrewsbury. In March 1560 he became marshal of the army sent by Elizabeth to assist the anti-regent Scots in the siege of Leith. The English intervention resulted in the French evacuation of Scotland by the treaty of Leith (6 July), leaving the field open for the triumph of the Scottish protestants. By 20 January 1561 Scrope had been appointed to the council of the north, and remained a member until his death. In April 1563 he became captain of Carlisle Castle (salary of &pound;221 per annum), where he conducted building work, and warden of the west marches (salary of &pound;424 annually), holding these positions until his death. That he occasionally attended court is suggested by his presence at Shane O'Neill's submission to the queen on 6 January 1562.<br>
<br>In September 1563 Scrope and other English commissioners negotiated a border treaty with the Scots. As warden, he rejected the Scottish offer of Hermitage Castle in exchange for an English alliance in 1564. In October 1565 he provided sanctuary to James Stewart, earl of Moray, following his defeat by his half-sister Mary, queen of Scots, in the chaseabout raid. In 1568, when news of Mary's arrival in Carlisle reached London, the privy council ordered Scrope and Sir Francis Knollys north to take charge of the charming refugee. The baron spent 20 marks weekly on his foreign guest. On 15 June he accompanied her outside Carlisle Castle to attend a football match. However, the proximity of Carlisle to Scotland, and the constant flocking of English Catholic nobles and gentry to the exiled queen, necessitated a move to Scrope's castle at Bolton in Wensleydale, Yorkshire, on 13 July. Lady Scrope conveyed messages from her brother the duke of Norfolk, encouraging Mary and probably making the first suggestion of a match between the queen and Norfolk. Her husband, however, warned London in November about the plans by Lord John Hamilton, commendator of Arbroath Abbey, to rescue the queen. Suspicious of his wife's communications with Mary, he moved Lady Scrope to a house 2 miles away from Bolton. Worries about the short distance (60 miles in a straight route) to Scotland and the prevalence of Catholicism among the local gentry led to Mary's move further south to Tutbury on 26 February 1569, allowing Scrope to return to his duties to the border.<br>
<br>While Scrope attended a hawking party hosted by the duke of Norfolk at Tattershall in June 1569, his loyalty to Queen Elizabeth was unquestioned. When the earls of Northumberland and Westmorland rebelled later that year, he forwarded Westmorland's appeal to his sister-in-law Lady Scrope to Cecil. He took active measures to repress the rebellion, but failed to prevent the earls' escape to Scotland. He preserved order in Cumberland during Leonard Dacre's uprising in February 1570, and in March he had a commission to assess treason fines against the supporters of the northern earls. In April he received a reinforcement of 500 foot and 100 horse with which to raid the defeated Dacre's Scottish allies. Although he burnt Ecclefechan and several villages in Eskdale and Annandale, Scrope's forces met significant Scottish resistance and wreaked less havoc than in the middle and east marches. Nevertheless, Scottish raiding ceased for a time as a result of the incursion.<br>
<br>Scrope maintained good relations with his Scottish counterparts (lords Maxwell and Herries and the earl of Angus) between 1573 and 1579; such partnerships were essential for maintaining good order in the borders. By February 1581, however, the situation had deteriorated and he requested a reinforcement of 100 foot and 100 horse. That June he gave refuge to followers (including Angus) of the recently deposed regent Morton in Carlisle. In company with the warden of the middle march he invaded Liddesdale in November. By July 1582 Scrope was refusing to meet the Scottish middle warden on account of his failure to redress the slaughters committed in Bewcastle Dale and Gillsland by Liddesdale Scots, although he remained willing to meet the western warden. The breakdown in order led him to suggest that the government provide 450 men to defend the borders, action which would force all the raids north. In 1585 he served as a commissioner inquiring into the murder of Francis, Lord Russell. The lack of co-operation in Scrope's area continued until March 1586 when James VI allowed him to raid north against Scottish outlaws. However, in August he complained to the privy council about the failure of the Scottish warden Lord Maxwell to provide justice against the Grahams of Esk. When an English party under Scrope's orders captured three Grahams, Maxwell's brother attacked them. Meanwhile the queen had nominated Scrope for the Garter, and he was installed by proxy on 15 April 1585. By October 1590 he had established good relations with Sir John Carmichael, Scottish west warden. A year later he reiterated his complaints about the constantly unruly Liddesdale men; the Scottish middle march warden Sir Robert Kerr failed to subdue them, and the grievance remained unresolved.<br>
<br>Scrope died in Carlisle on 13 June 1592 and was buried in the cathedral there on 22 August. Queen Elizabeth commented, &#145;we have great cause to be sorry in respect of the honourable service he has long time done us in that office&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1580&#150;1625</i>, 332). George MacDonald Fraser considered him &#145;one of the best Wardens in Border history&#146;  (Fraser, 248). He was succeeded as tenth baron by his son Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1609). Thomas's son Emmanuel Scrope became earl of Sunderland on 19 June 1627 and died on 30 May 1630, the last of his line.<br>
