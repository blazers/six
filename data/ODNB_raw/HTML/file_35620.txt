<span class="headword">Procter,  Francis</span>  (1812&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and liturgical scholar</span>, born at Hackney on 21 June 1812, was the only son of Francis Procter, a warehouseman in Gracechurch Street, Manchester, and his wife, Mary. He was of delicate health, and spent the early years of his life at Newland vicarage, Gloucestershire, under the care of an uncle, Payler Procter, who was vicar there. In 1825 he was sent to Shrewsbury School under Samuel Butler, and thence passed in 1831 to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where another uncle, Dr Joseph Procter, was master. In 1835 he graduated BA as thirtieth wrangler and eleventh in the second class of the classical tripos. In the following year he was ordained deacon in the diocese of Lincoln, and in 1838 priest in the diocese of Ely. He served curacies at Streatley, Bedfordshire, from 1836 to 1840, and at Romsey from 1840 to 1842, when he gave up for a time parochial work in order to become fellow and assistant tutor of his college. In 1847 he left the university for the vicarage of Witton, Norfolk. There the rest of his long life was spent. In 1848 he married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Meryon of Rye, Sussex; they had five sons and three daughters. Procter died at Witton on 24 August 1905 and was buried in its churchyard.<br>
<br>Procter was author of <span class="italic">A History of the Book of Common Prayer, with a Rationale of its Offices</span>, first published in 1855. In many subsequent editions Procter kept the work abreast of the liturgical studies of the day. Further revised with Procter's concurrence in 1901 by W. H. Frere, it remained of value for many years. Later he edited the Sarum breviary, for which he transcribed the text of the great breviary printed at Paris in 1531. The first volume, with Christopher Wordsworth as joint editor (and with the assistance of Henry Bradshaw and others), was published in 1875, the second in 1882, and the third in 1886. Procter's liturgical work was careful and scholarly; his text book followed the lines of sound exposition laid down by Charles Wheatley (1686&#150;1742) and his followers, and his edition of the Sarum breviary was the most notable achievement of an era which was first developing the systematic study of medieval service books.<br>
