<span class="headword">Dowson,  Ernest Christopher</span>  (1867&#150;1900), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 2 August 1867 at 11 The Grove, Lee, Kent, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Alfred Christopher Dowson (1843&#150;1894), nephew of the colonial politician and poet Alfred Domett and friend of Robert Browning and Robert Louis Stevenson, and his wife, Annie Chalmers Swan (1848/9&#150;1895), of Scottish descent, and daughter of Robert Dalgliesh Swan, East India Company officer. In August 1894 Ernest's father died (possibly intentionally) from an overdose of a sleeping draught; his mother committed suicide by hanging six months later. After irregular schooling he went up to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1886. He left in March 1888 after five terms, without completing the papers for honour moderations.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford, Dowson worked supervising the dry dock which his father had owned, Bridge Dock, on the Thames at Limehouse, which later featured as &#145;Rainham's Dock&#146; in <span class="italic">A Comedy of Masks</span>. His work there was not characterized by any great commitment; he preferred instead to be in the London literary society of Lionel Pigot Johnson, Richard Le Gallienne, Oscar Wilde, and Aubrey Beardsley. He contributed to the principal aesthetic magazines: the <span class="italic">Century Guild Hobby Horse</span>, the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, and <span class="italic">The Savoy</span>. He was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95480', "Rhymers' Club")</script> and contributed poems to the two collections of their work (1892 and 1894). The club met at a pub in Fleet Street, as Yeats, its most famous member, remembers in &#145;The Grey Rock&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Poets with whom I learned my trade,<br>
</div>
<div>Companions of the Cheshire Cheese.<br>
</div> (W. B. Yeats, <span class="italic">Responsibilities</span>, 1914)</blockquote>In the same poem he particularly singles out Dowson and Johnson:<blockquote>
<div>Dowson and Johnson most I praise&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>To troop with those the world's forgot.<br>
</div> (ibid.)</blockquote>In &#145;The tragic generation&#146; (book 4 of <span class="italic">The Trembling of the Veil</span>, 1922) Yeats recalled the personalities of the 1890s, including Dowson, and helped to create the myth of the decadent <i>po&egrave;tes maudits</i>. The myth has been revised and modified slightly since Yeats, but the general picture of Dowson as a decadent, prizing artistic production above all else and living a life opposed to Victorian views of propriety and probity, remains. Dowson collaborated with Arthur Moore on the novel <span class="italic">A Comedy of Masks</span> (1893). His principal published works were <span class="italic">Dilemmas</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Verses</span> (1896), <span class="italic">The Pierrot of the Minute: a Dramatic Phantasy in one Act</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Adrian Rome</span> (1899; with Moore), and <span class="italic">Decorations</span> (1899). He was assistant editor on the short-lived magazine <span class="italic">The Critic</span> in 1890, for which he wrote &#145;Between the acts&#146;, &#145;The cult of the child&#146;, and articles on music-halls.<br>
<br>The principal love affair of Dowson's life was with Adelaide (Missie) Foltinowicz (1877/8&#150;1903), who was eleven when he first met her serving in a restaurant, The Poland, in Sherwood Street, London, in November 1889. She was his Beatrice and the dedicatee of <span class="italic">Verses</span>. She married the tailor August Noelte, causing Dowson great mental anguish. He regarded his unsatisfied love for her as something like Keats's for Fanny Brawne. Through the letters and poetry there runs a strong current of paedophilia, which has an erotic strain; but it is tempered by a humane and romantic appreciation of the freshness and generosity of children not yet tainted by the manners of society. In his letters this positive appreciation runs alongside outbreaks of striking misanthropy. &#145;Growth&#146; is an important poem on the loss of childhood. Dowson's poetry is lyrical, mannered, literary, mellifluous, and in a diction operating on a narrow register. The principal modern influence is A. C. Swinburne, but one can also trace the influence of the French symbolists, especially Verlaine, as well as that of the classical Latin poets. T. S. Eliot felt Dowson to be the most gifted and technically perfect poet of his age. His most famous poem is &#145;Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno cynarae&#146;, modelled on the first ode in book 4 of Horace and containing the well-known refrain &#145;I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion&#146;. &#145;Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat incohare longam&#146;, with its reference to &#145;the days of wine and roses&#146;, is a quintessentially 1890s piece.<br>
<br>About 1891&#150;2 Dowson was received into the Roman Catholic church, and he produced certain religio-aesthetic poems, such as &#145;Nuns of Perpetual Adoration&#146; and &#145;Carthusians&#146;. The dry dock was relinquished to the foreman in 1894 and Dowson lived in Brittany, principally in Pont-Aven. Leonard Smithers paid him a salary for producing translations. His best work in this field included Emile Zola's <span class="italic">La terre</span> (1894), Louis Couperus's <span class="italic">Majest&eacute;</span> (1894), Honor&eacute; de Balzac's <span class="italic">La fille aux yeux d'or</span> (1896), Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's <span class="italic">Les liaisons dangereuses</span> (1898), Guillaume Dubois's <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires du Cardinal Dubois</span> (1899), Voltaire's <span class="italic">La pucelle d'Orl&eacute;ans</span> (1899), and Edmond and Jules de Goncourt's <span class="italic">Les ma&icirc;tresses de Louis XV</span> (as <span class="italic">The Confidantes of a King: the Mistresses of Louis XV</span>, 1907). Smithers was also editor of <span class="italic">The Savoy</span> and encouraged Dowson to submit work. But Smithers's dissolute lifestyle had an adverse influence on Dowson. The combination of self-indulgence, drink, depression caused by the failure of the dry dock, his parents' deaths, the betrayal (as he saw it) of Missie, and the tuberculosis he contracted in 1894 weakened his resistance. Although owed money for the family business, he was now impoverished, and spent the last three weeks of his life being looked after by the author Robert Harborough Sherard and his wife. He died, unmarried, on 23 February 1900 at the Sherards' house, 26 Sandhurst Gardens, Catford, London, and was buried on 27 February in Ladywell cemetery, Lewisham, London.<br>
