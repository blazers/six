<span class="headword">Randolph, Sir  George Granville</span>  (1818&#150;1907), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in London on 26 January 1818, was the son of Thomas Randolph, prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral from 1812 until his death in 1875, chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria, and rector of Hadham, Hertfordshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23120/', "Dr John Randolph")</script>, bishop of London, was his grandfather. George Randolph entered the navy as a first-class volunteer on 7 December 1830. He was commissioned lieutenant on 27 June 1838. In the following September he was appointed to the frigate <i>North Star</i> (26 guns), under Captain Lord John Hay, commodore on the north coast of Spain. He next (from 1840 to 1844) served on the <i>Vernon</i> (50 guns) in the Mediterranean, latterly as first lieutenant. In October 1844 he became first lieutenant of the <i>Daedalus</i> (20 guns), on the East India station, and on 19 August 1845 commanded her barge at the destruction of Malloodoo, a pirate stronghold in Borneo.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1846 Randolph was promoted, and a year later was appointed to the <i>Bellerophon</i> (78 guns); in this ship and in the <i>Rodney</i> he served for six years in the Mediterranean. In 1851 Randolph married Eleanor Harriet, daughter of the Revd Joseph Arkwright of Mark Hall, near Harlow, Essex; she died in April 1907. He was present in the <i>Rodney</i> at the attack on Fort Constantine, Sevastopol, took part in other operations in the Black Sea, and served ashore in the naval brigade; he received the fourth class of the Mejidiye. He was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and promoted captain on 18 November 1854. He commanded the <i>Cornwallis</i>, coastguard ship in the Humber, and afterwards the screw frigates <i>Diadem</i> and <i>Orlando</i> on the North American station.<br>
<br>The <i>Orlando</i> was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1863, and Randolph remained in her until May 1865, when he was appointed to the guardship at Sheerness. He was awarded a good service pension in March 1867, and from September 1867 until March 1869 was commodore at the Cape of Good Hope. He received the CB in June 1869, and was promoted to his flag on 24 April 1872. From December 1873 to June 1875 he commanded the detached squadron, his last active employment. He was promoted vice-admiral on 16 September 1877, retired on 26 July 1881, and was promoted admiral on 8 July 1884. At the 1897 diamond jubilee celebrations he was made KCB.<br>
<br>Randolph published in 1867 <span class="italic">The Rule of the Road at Sea</span>, and in 1879, <span class="italic">Problems in Naval Tactics</span>; he was a corresponding member of the Royal United Service Institution and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He died on 16 May 1907 at his home, 70 Brunswick Place, Hove, Brighton, and was buried at Hove.<br>
<br>A fine seaman and a brave officer, Randolph reached an appropriate peak in his career, commanding one of the last squadrons principally powered by sail.<br>
