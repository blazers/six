<span class="headword">Pollock,  Hugh McDowell</span>  (1852&#150;1937), <span class="occ">businessman and politician</span>, was born in Bangor, co. Down, on 16 November 1852, third and youngest son of James Pollock, master mariner, and his wife, Eliza McDowell. Educated at Bangor endowed school, he served a shipbroking apprenticeship, then moved to McIlroy, Pollock, flour importers, which became the central vehicle of his business career, and which, under the name Shaw, Pollock &amp; Co., grew into the largest such enterprise in Ireland. His business interests included directorships in manufacturing, shipping, and linen companies, and it was his acumen in this field that brought him to public prominence during the latter part of the First World War.<br>
<br>In 1917 Pollock was appointed director of wheat supplies under the food controller for the north of Ireland, and, having been elected president of the Belfast chamber of commerce for that year, he was nominated <i>ex officio</i> to the Irish Convention (1917&#150;18). His mastery of Anglo-Irish financial complexities quickly earned him respect and nomination to the convention's inner committee of nine. In 1918 he was appointed chairman of the Ulster selective committee, of the Ministry of Labour, a post he held until 1921, and during these same years (1918&#150;21) he became president of the Belfast harbour commission (which he served from 1899 to 1937 as a member). His contribution to the commission, and especially to its works, law, and finance committees, led in 1933 to its naming after him its new Pollock Dock and basin.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly, therefore, when Northern Ireland was established by the 1920 <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span>, Pollock emerged as one of the principal figures of the new administration. Elected Unionist MP for South Belfast in 1921, he held this seat (altered and renamed Windsor in 1929) until his death, and he was chosen by Sir James Craig to be his first minister of finance and deputy premier. Thus, at the age of sixty-nine, Pollock embarked on a political career, in circumstances of communal violence and acute financial difficulty. He was to retain both responsibilities for the rest of his life, earning a reputation for probity in public office and emerging as a champion of self-reliance for his province.<br>
<br>The optimistic economic assumptions of the immediate post-war period had already been confounded by the time Pollock took office. His input to the Northern Ireland special arbitration committee (1923&#150;5), established to review the province's funding and chaired by Lord Colwyn, ensured that Northern Ireland would be able to keep parity of social benefits with the rest of the United Kingdom, but he was unable, in the depressed conditions of the inter-war years and under the newly agreed formula, to bring Northern Ireland's underdeveloped services, in education, health, housing, and general infrastructure, up to the national level. Still, his judicious use of the loans guarantee acts, well into the 1930s, did keep up a measure of activity in a shipbuilding industry that might otherwise have perished. In 1932 he attended the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa as an advisory member of the British delegation.<br>
<br>One of the province's leading educationists, Pollock had given evidence to the viceregal committee of inquiry into primary education (Ireland) in 1918 and in 1922 he chaired a committee to provide for teacher training in the north. For many years he served as chairman of the board of Victoria College, one of the United Kingdom's pioneering institutions of female education.<br>
<br>In 1885 Pollock married Mrs Annie Robinson, daughter of Andrew Marshall, of Brooklyn, USA; they had four sons and a daughter. A privy councillor (1921), a doctor of laws (from Trinity College, Dublin, 1935), and a Companion of Honour (1936), Pollock was also a deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace for Belfast. Throughout, he was an orthodox finance minister, to whom a deficit represented moral as well as financial bankruptcy. Courageous, kindly, a doughty but fair debater, a disciplined intellectual, and a devout Presbyterian, his life was characterized, above all, as one of service: the integrity of that service emerged at his death in sincere tributes from political opponents (socialist and nationalist) and supporters alike. Widely travelled and read, he enjoyed golf and shooting and belonged to the Ulster Reform Club and to the Overseas League, in which he played a prominent part. Pollock died on 15 April 1937 at his home, 26 Windsor Avenue, Belfast, and was buried in Belfast city cemetery.<br>
