<span class="headword">Middleton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cumbers]</span>,  Yevonde Philone</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Madame Yevonde]</span>  (1893&#150;1975), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born Yevonde Philone Cumbers on 5 January 1893 at The Cottage, St Julian's Road, Streatham Common, London, the daughter of Frederick Cumbers, a director of Johnstone and Cumbers, manufacturers of printing inks, and Ethel Westerton. In 1899 the family moved to Bromley in Kent. Educated with her sister Verena both at home and at a succession of day schools and boarding-schools, at fourteen Yevonde finally found a school which suited her: Lingholt, a progressive boarding-school at Hindhead in Surrey. Two years later the sisters were sent to a convent school in Verviers in Belgium; again unhappy, Yevonde instigated a move to Paris where she and Verena studied at the Sorbonne and lodged at a supervised boarding house for women students. At seventeen and &#145;finished&#146;, Yevonde returned to the family home in Bromley.<br>
<br>In 1910 while still a student on the continent, Yevonde joined the women's suffrage movement, and on her return to Britain she continued to promote female emancipation. In defiance of her genteel upbringing she decided to take up a profession and, after seeing an advertisement for a photographer's apprentice in <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, settled upon photography. She approached Lallie Charles, one of the leading portrait photographers of the day, and was accepted for three years' tuition at Charles's studio at 39A Curzon Street in London's Mayfair. Six months before completing her apprenticeship, and only ever having taken one photograph, Yevonde left Charles's employ and&#151;in 1914, with a loan from her father&#151;opened her own studio at 92 Victoria Street, London.<br>
<br>Madame Yevonde, as she called herself, began by imitating Lallie Charles but quickly developed her own signature style. She used dramatic lighting against a dark background and printed on sepia-toned platinotype paper to give a more modelled effect. In 1916 she temporarily gave up her studio to work as a land girl. After her return to photography, Yevonde's portraits of celebrities began to appear regularly in society magazines, such as <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, and the new fashion magazines. Her reputation was such that in 1922 she was commissioned to take the official engagement portrait of Lord Louis Mountbatten and Edwina Ashley (now in the National Portrait Gallery).<br>
<br>In 1921 Yevonde moved into larger premises at 100 Victoria Street. In that same year she became the first woman to address the congress of the Professional Photographers' Association. She was given as her subject &#145;Photographic portraiture from a woman's point of view&#146;, and chose to discuss the work of women photographers past and present. Her claim that women made better portraitists than men caused a minor controversy when her lecture was published in the <span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span> (29 April 1921). She later lectured on photography as a profession for women at the second annual conference of the Business and Professional Women's Federation held in Paris in 1936.<br>
<br>The 1920s saw Yevonde producing creative figure compositions in addition to her commercial portrait work. Examples appeared in the society and fashion journals, in <span class="italic">Photograms of the Year</span> for 1921 and 1923, and at leading photographic exhibitions. She was also making her name in the new field of advertising photography with her distinctive series of advertisements for Eno's Fruit Salts. It was in the 1930s, however, that she began to produce the photographs for which she is best remembered. In the early 1930s Yevonde began to work with Dr D. A. Spencer's Vivex colour process, building upon her earlier mastery in monochrome of costume, staging, and lighting effects to create intensely vibrant portraits and still lifes. In 1932 she mounted at the Albany Gallery in London a one-woman exhibition of her work, said to be the first in England to include colour portrait photographs. In 1933 she moved to a new studio at 28 Berkeley Square in Mayfair. There she exhibited her &#145;Goddesses and Others&#146; photographs in 1935. The costumes worn by society women to a charity fancy-dress ball provided the starting point for this series of inventive and often surrealist tableaux, the props for which included a stuffed bull's head, rubber snakes, and a revolver. The sitters for these dramatically modern reinterpretations of classical female icons included Mrs Anthony Eden, the Hon. Mrs Bryan Guinness (Lady Diana Mosley), and the duchess of Wellington.<br>
<br>Yevonde was committed to colour photography at a time when it was not considered a serious medium of expression. She did, however, receive some contemporary recognition for her work in this field. A number of the images from the &#145;Goddesses&#146; series were identified in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;among the best direct colour photographs we have seen&#146;  (11 July 1935), and two of Yevonde's photographs taken aboard the <i>Queen Mary</i> for <span class="italic">Fortune</span> magazine in 1936 were shown in the exhibition &#145;Photography 1839&#150;1937&#146; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1940 she was elected as a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society for her work in colour photography.<br>
<br>The end of the 1930s was significant for Yevonde not only because of the approaching war: her husband, the playwright and journalist Edgar Charles William Middleton (<i>c</i>.1895&#150;1939), whom she married on 13 February 1920, died in April 1939. A year later the Vivex factory closed, bringing to an end her work in colour. In 1940 Yevonde published her frank and self-deprecating autobiography <span class="italic">In Camera</span>. She also produced one of her last works in colour: an allegorical self-portrait in which the photographer, distinctively dark-haired and snub-nosed, holds up a black and white negative (Yevonde Portrait Archive).<br>
<br>After her husband's death Yevonde moved from their London home at 3 Dr Johnson's Buildings in the Inner Temple to Dolphin Square in Pimlico, and then, to escape the bombing of London, to Farnham in Surrey. After the war she moved back to the capital, to 33 Bedford Gardens in Kensington, and in 1955 she moved her studio to 16A Trevor Street in Knightsbridge. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, working in black and white, she continued to photograph leading artists, actors, and writers and to exhibit her work. In June 1973 the Royal Photographic Society mounted a one-woman exhibition celebrating Yevonde's sixty years as a portrait photographer. Two years later, on 22 December 1975, she died of breast cancer in St Stephen's Hospital, Fulham, in London. The main archive of her work is held at Compton, Hampshire, with smaller collections in the National Portrait Gallery and the Royal Photographic Society collection at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford.<br>
