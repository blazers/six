<span class="headword">Blencowe, Sir  John</span>  (1642&#150;1726), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 30 November 1642 at Marston St Lawrence, on Northamptonshire's border with Oxfordshire, the eldest son of Thomas Blencowe (1602&#150;1674) and his second wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1618&#150;1687), daughter of the Revd Dr Francis Savage of Ripple, Worcestershire. Blencowe's family had been lords of the manor of Marston since the mid-fifteenth century, before which time they had long been settled at Greystoke in Cumberland. On 24 May 1661 Blencowe matriculated as a student at Oriel College, Oxford, several earlier members of his family having been closely associated with the college, one as a benefactor and another, Anthony Blencowe, as its provost from 1572 to 1617.<br>
<br>Blencowe began his legal studies at the Inner Temple in November 1663 and was called to the bar in November 1670. On 23 December 1675 he married Anne (1656&#150;1718) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41326/', "Blencowe, Anne")</script>], the eldest daughter of John Wallis, the eminent Savillian professor of geometry at Oxford whose outstanding ability at decoding intercepted messages and documents had rendered him invaluable to the post-Restoration government. The marriage subsequently produced three sons, one of whom was the cryptographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2635/', "William Blencowe")</script>, and four daughters. Blencowe established a solid reputation at the bar. In 1687 he was made a bencher of his inn of court, and in April 1689 he became serjeant-at-law. In 1690 Blencowe was elected to parliament for Brackley, a short distance from the family estate which he had inherited on his father's death in 1674. He naturally featured in Commons proceedings as a whig firmly attached to the court, but stood down at the 1695 election. John Wallis had for several years persistently badgered his contacts among senior government figures for his son-in-law's advancement to the judicial bench, though without success. In June 1696, however, Lord Keeper Somers proposed that he be appointed a baron of the exchequer; and in forwarding the recommendation to the king, the duke of Shrewsbury, secretary of state, commended Blencowe as &#145;an honest and able lawyer&#146; who had given the government consistent support during his spell in the House of Commons. The appointment took effect from September, though Wallis complained to the new secretary of state, Sir William Trumbull, that he had wanted Blencowe to be a judge of the common pleas rather than the exchequer where the fees were paltry in comparison to his practice. In November 1697, however, Blencowe was transferred to the court of common pleas, and on 12 December he was knighted by the king at Kensington. When the chief judgeship of that court became vacant early in 1701, Wallis naturally pressed for Blencowe's promotion though Blencowe himself had avoided making an application for it, knowing that the lord chief justice, Sir John Holt, had it earmarked for Sir Thomas Trevor. Shortly after Queen Anne's accession there was some feeling that he might be removed, but he remained a puisne judge in common pleas and in fact was destined to progress no further on the judicial ladder. Some older authorities err in stating that he sat from this time in queen's bench.<br>
<br>Blencowe retained his post at George I's accession in 1715. He retired in June 1722 aged eighty, and as a mark of ministerial gratitude for many years' service he was granted a continuation of his official salary of &pound;1000 in the form of an annuity. While still active as a judge, he became obsessed with discovering a way of determining longitude, although his ideas, which apparently filled several reams of paper, were not taken seriously. He was remembered for his honesty and blunt integrity, and a story illustrating his humane disposition relates how he refused his wife's plea to dismiss one of his labourers, an old man of ninety, and allow him to remain at home on his wage of 8<i>d</i>. a day. &#145;Let him spoil on&#146;, the judge is reported to have said, &#145;he has pleasure in thinking he earns his daily bread at fourscore years and ten; but if you turn him off he will soon die of grief&#146;  (Baker, 639). Dementia seems to have overtaken Blencowe in his last years when he was sometimes under an impression that he was already dead. He died on 6 May 1726 and was buried at Marston.<br>
