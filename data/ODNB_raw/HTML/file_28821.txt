<span class="headword">Wathen,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1752, <em>d.</em> 1828), <span class="occ">artist and pedestrian</span>, was baptized on 1 July 1752 in the parish church of All Saints, Hereford, the son of Thomas Wathen (<i>d</i>. 1779), a glover of the city, and his wife, Dorothy Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1801) of Bristol. According to the Revd Richard Warner's <span class="italic">Literary Recollections</span>, Wathen's education was &#145;humble&#146; but based upon &#145;considerable English reading&#146;  (1.383). Wathen worked in the trade of gloving until his middle years, but at an early age became &#145;an ardent admirer of Nature, and all her wild and picturesque scenery&#146;  (ibid.), making frequent excursions into the Herefordshire countryside with his sketchbook. With a pencil and simple washes it was said that he could produce up to twenty views a day. These sketches, which were often dated and were frequently framed in coloured paper, were presented to his friends, who knew him as Jemmy Sketch; certainly na&iuml;ve, they have the freshness of the work of a self-taught primitivist. Wathen painted everyday scenes and took a particular delight in vernacular architecture, recording virtually all the timber-framed buildings of his native city. His earliest sketch in a public collection is dated 1779, but his most prolific period in Herefordshire was the 1790s.<br>
<br>Wathen appears to have offered his services as a guide to artists and tourists who wished to make expeditions down the River Wye, making a &#145;minute delineation of the course of the river, its picturesque points and the objects of curiosity in the neighbourhood&#146;  (R. Warner, <span class="italic">A Walk through Wales, August 1797</span>, 1799, 213). On these trips he frequently obtained paintings and sketches from notable artists and thus assembled his own collection of topographical art. His work became well known to the general public via the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Two sketches were published in June 1787 that depicted the collapsed west end of Hereford Cathedral and these were followed by four views of the cathedral, engraved by S. Middiman and F. Jukes, &#145;before, during and after the collapse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hereford Journal</span>, 19 Sept 1787). These were highly regarded and were recommended to John Britton for his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the Cathedral Church of Hereford</span> (1831), although they were not used. During his lifetime Wathen provided many sketches for guidebooks to Wales and the marches, and his contributions to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> included accounts and engravings of Aconbury chapel, Kilpeck church, Marden church, Burghope House, Longworth chapel, White Cross (Hereford), Dore Abbey, and Putley Cross.<br>
<br>In 1801 Wathen inherited Aconbury Court from his uncle and namesake, James Wathen, which enabled him to buy a fine property&#151;Aylestone Hill House&#151;in the suburbs of Hereford, where he lived until his death. Emancipated from gloving, he embarked upon a series of long-distance walking tours: sketchbooks survive for a northern tour to Scotland in 1808 and a south-western tour in 1825. His stamina on these tours became legendary. He could travel 32 miles a day and outpace the horses upon which his companions travelled. The horses required &#145;two hours to bait, whereas Mr. W wanted only an hour&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 282). He was a vegetarian and never drank wine, beer, or spirits; tea was his principal refreshment.<br>
<br>In 1811 Wathen sailed with an old school friend, Captain James Prendergast, to India and China, and he published in 1814 <span class="italic">Journal of a Voyage to India and China</span> in two volumes, illustrated with twenty-four coloured prints from drawings by the author. It was well reviewed by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as &#145;a plain unvarnished tale&#146;  (Warner, 1.387). Wathen also intended to publish an account of his European tour on which he was cordially received by Byron but his numerous sketches for this remain, unpublished, in Hereford City Library. In 1821 he capitalized on Napoleon's exile to St Helena by publishing <span class="italic">A Series of Views Illustrative of the Island of St Helena</span>, which he had compiled on his return journey from the east in 1812. The book's frontispiece was a print of a portrait of Wathen painted by A. J. Oliver (1774&#150;1842). Wathen made a trip to Heligoland in 1827 and in the following spring he completed his fortieth walk to London. He returned to Hereford and died at his home there on 20 August 1828 in his seventy-sixth year. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> ran a long obituary which began:<blockquote>The loss of this ingenious and worthy gentleman will be deeply regretted by a most numerous acquaintance in all parts of the United Kingdom; for in all parts of the country was he known by his talents as a Draftsman, and his pleasant and social manners as a friend. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 281)</blockquote>His will revealed the extent of his art collection and he made numerous bequests to his friends, including the artist David Cox, of works by artists including Thomas Gainsborough, Alfred Nicholson, John &#145;Warwick&#146; Smith, Nicholas Pocock, and John Glover. His executors were requested to present sixty or seventy of Wathen's drawings to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, where they can still be seen. The most substantial collection of his works is in Hereford City Library; Hereford Record Office and the bishop's library, Hereford, also have collections.<br>
