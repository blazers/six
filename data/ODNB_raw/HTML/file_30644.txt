<span class="headword">Bauerman,  Hilary</span>  (1835&#150;1909), <span class="occ">mineralogist and geologist</span>, was born in London on 16 March 1835, the younger son in the family of two sons and one daughter of Hilary John Bauerman (1806/7&#150;1888), merchant, and his wife, Anna Hudina Rosetta (1804/5&#150;1874), daughter of Dr Wychers. His parents migrated from Emden, in Hesse, to London in August 1829. On 6 November 1851 Bauerman was entered as one of the seven original students of the Government School of Mines, later the Royal School of Mines, in Jermyn Street. At the change of name in 1862 the degree of associate of the Royal School of Mines was conferred on him. In 1853 he went to the <i>Bergakademie</i> at Freiberg in Saxony to complete his studies, and on his return to England in 1855 he was appointed an assistant geologist to the Geological Survey of Great Britain. In 1858 he went to Canada as geologist to the North American boundary commission; from 1863, when this task was completed, he was intermittently engaged for many years in searching for mineral deposits and surveying mining properties in various parts of Europe, Asia, and America, mostly by private persons or by companies, but also by the Indian and Egyptian governments (1867&#150;9).<br>
<br>Apart from this fieldwork, Bauerman contributed to technical and scientific literature. His <span class="italic">Treatise on the Metallurgy of Iron</span> (1868) reached its sixth and last edition in 1890, and was followed by his <span class="italic">Text-Book of Systematic Mineralogy</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Text-Book of Descriptive Mineralogy</span> (1884). Lastly, in 1887, he assisted J. A. Phillips to revise and enlarge the latter's <span class="italic">Elements of Metallurgy</span>, which was originally published in 1874.<br>
<br>In his later years Bauerman devoted himself mainly to teaching: in 1874 he first acted as an examiner for the Department of Science and Art; in 1883 he was lecturer in metallurgy at Firth College, Sheffield; and in 1888 he succeeded John Percy as professor of metallurgy at the Ordnance College, Woolwich. He retired from the post in 1906 but maintained until his death a keen interest in the developments of metallurgy and mining. He was a fellow, and for some time a vice-president, of the Geological Society; an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, by which he was awarded the Howard prize in 1897; an honorary member of the Iron and Steel Institute, and also of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, which awarded him its gold medal in 1906 in recognition of his many services in the advancement of metallurgical science.<br>
<br>Despite partial deafness, which increased with his years, Bauerman's prodigious memory and his genial manner made him a highly successful teacher. He was an indefatigable and versatile worker, his favourite hobbies in later years being crystallography and geometry. He died, unmarried, at his home, 142 Cavendish Road, Balham, London, on 5 December 1909, and was cremated at Woking crematorium, after which his ashes were interred at Brookwood cemetery. He left a bequest to encourage the study of mineralogical science in connection with the Royal School of Mines.<br>
