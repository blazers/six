<span class="headword">Townesend,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1676, <em>d.</em> 1739), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was baptized on 17 December 1676 at St Giles's Church, Oxford, the second child and eldest of the three sons of John Townesend (1648&#150;1728), a mason of Oxford, and his wife, Elizabeth Morrell or Morall. His brothers, John (1678&#150;1742) and George (1681&#150;1719), were also masons&#151;the former practised in London and the latter in the Bristol area&#151;but William, the most successful member of the family, remained in Oxford and became the leading master mason in the town during a particularly active phase in its architectural history. Alongside its other main protagonists, the amateur architects Dr Henry Aldrich of Christ Church and Dr George Clarke of All Souls, and the professional Nicholas Hawksmoor, he was a prominent figure in this development; and the statement of the antiquary Thomas Hearne in 1720, that he &#145;hath a hand in all the Buildings of Oxford, and gets a vast deal of Money that way&#146;  (quoted in Colvin, <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of British Architects</span>, 3rd edn, 1995, p. 985), was no exaggeration. His first major undertakings were the erection of Peckwater quadrangle at Christ Church (1706&#150;14) to the design of Aldrich and the fellows' building and cloister at Corpus Christi College (1706&#150;12); and from then on until his death, occasionally working in partnership with another Oxford mason, Bartholomew Peisley (<i>d</i>. 1727), he was involved in virtually every significant building project in the university. He also worked elsewhere in the neighbourhood, notably at Radley Hall, Berkshire (1721&#150;5), and as a contractor at Blenheim Palace (1720&#150;39), while other aspects of his business were quarry-working and the production of funerary monuments.<br>
<br>In the building accounts of Queen's College, Oxford, Townesend is referred to as &#145;architecto&#146;, whereas his father, who had worked there previously, was described as &#145;lapicidae&#146;, a distinction which reflects the fact that, like others of his kind, he was certainly able to design as well as to build; but the extent to which he did so unaided is not entirely clear, many of the projects in Oxford at this time evidently being the work of more than one mind. In two cases where he executed designs by Hawksmoor, the Clarendon Building (1712&#150;15) and the north quadrangle of All Souls (1716&#150;35), he had submitted alternative proposals himself; and at Christ Church Library (1717&#150;38) he acted as Clarke's architectural amanuensis, drawing out his designs as well as executing them. More complicated was the situation at Queen's, where designs for the front quad were prepared by Hawksmoor, but the scheme executed by Townesend (1710&#150;21) appears to have been almost entirely the joint work of himself and Clarke; while for the new building at Magdalen, the original design by Edward Holdsworth was revised by Townesend in 1731 under Clarke's direction.<br>
<br>In these circumstances Townesend's own architectural identity is not very clearly defined. His predominant mode, in the Clarendon Building and All Souls designs and at Queen's, as well as in other works, such as the Christ Church buttery (1722) and his Durham quadrangle range at Trinity College (1728), was a simplified version of the baroque of Hawksmoor and Sir John Vanbrugh; but the fellows' building at Corpus Christi College, of which he may have been the designer as well as the builder, was close to the proto-Palladian manner of the Peckwater quadrangle, while his Radcliffe quadrangle at University College (1717&#150;19)&#151;again devised under Clarke's direction&#151;and his Robinson Buildings at Oriel College (1719&#150;20) were faithful copies of the traditional Jacobean style of the adjoining fabric, the former including a skilfully executed Gothic vault.<br>
<br>Townesend and his wife, Mary, had two children who survived their father: a son, John, who carried on the business, and a daughter. William Townesend died in September 1739 and was buried at St Giles's Church on 22 September.<br>
