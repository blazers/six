<span class="headword">Ames,  Jeremiah</span>  (1706&#150;1776), <span class="occ">banker and merchant</span>, was born on 20 July 1706 at Evercreech, near Shepton Mallet, Somerset, one of eight children of Levi Ames (<i>d</i>. 1726), grocer, and his first wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1711), daughter of John Watts of Doulting, Somerset. Ames was one of four brothers; he also had four sisters. Until his father's death in 1726, he worked as his apprentice in the grocery trade, acquiring the basic commercial skills which were to stand him in such good stead in later years. He was married to Phoebe Collins, the seventh of ten children of Robert Collins of Horton, near Ilminster, Somerset, probably around 1730. Together they had four sons and three daughters. From the 1730s onwards Ames was increasingly involved with the commercial, civic, and religious life of the city of Bristol, where he lived for many years at 17 Lower Maudlin Lane.<br>
<br>Ames was chiefly known as one of the six founding partners of the Harford Bank, the fourth oldest private banking house in Bristol, established in 1769. However, his interest in banking developed relatively late in life and no doubt stemmed directly from his long-standing commercial interests in Bristol and its hinterland. Indeed his business activities closely mirrored the diverse economy of the expanding metropolis of the west. Ames was active in sugar baking and refining, the manufacture of snuff and tobacco, gunpowder making, and dealing in iron goods; he also had extensive interests in shipping. He was a co-founder of the Bristol Fire Office, which underwrote fire insurance for domestic and commercial property and goods. Ames himself had extensive property interests, including mills, warehouses, and a considerable number of properties for private rental in Bristol. Together with his brother Samuel, he inherited land and property in and around Shepton Mallet.<br>
<br>Ames spent a lifetime serving the city of Bristol in a variety of civic capacities. For many years an alderman, he was elected sheriff of the city on 29 September 1742 and on 15 September 1759 was chosen as mayor. The high regard for the probity of his business dealings and the execution of his official duties no doubt stemmed, in part, from his involvement in nonconformist religious society, notably the Unitarian church.<br>
<br>Ames died in Bristol on 3 April 1776, aged sixty-nine, and was survived by his wife. An obituary notice in <span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span> (6 April 1776) noted:<blockquote>Wednesday morning died Jeremiah Ames, Esq; Alderman of this city. His inviolable integrity in his commercial and judicial capacity rendered him a valuable member of society. And his domestic virtues endearing him to his relatives, oblige them to lament their loss, and to venerate his memory.</blockquote>He was buried shortly afterwards in the dissenting burial-ground, Brunswick Square, Bristol. The chief beneficiary of his complex legacy was his eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_57058"></a><span class="headword">Levi Ames</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1739, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">banker and merchant</span>, whose life and career closely mirrored those of his father. He lived next door at 15 Lower Maudlin Lane and was a partner in the bank of Ames, Cave &amp; Co. between 1786 and 1820. He was elected sheriff of Bristol in 1771 and became mayor in 1788. Ames was twice married: first, in 1770, to Anna Maria Poole, and later to a woman whose name was probably Elizabeth Wraxhall. He died on 16 December 1820.<br>
