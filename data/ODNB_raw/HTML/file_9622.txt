<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick,  Barnaby</span>, second baron of Upper Ossory  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1581), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was the eldest son and heir of five children of Barnaby (Brian) Fitzpatrick, first baron of Upper Ossory (<i>d</i>. 1575), chieftain and landowner, and Margaret, eldest daughter of Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond. His father&#151;under the terms of the Tudor surrender and regrant initiative&#151;abandoned the Gaelic title of MacGiolla Ph&aacute;draig in favour of Fitzpatrick, being created baron of Upper Ossory in June 1541. As a demonstration of his loyalty his son was sent to court about June 1543 to receive an English education. Young Fitzpatrick soon found himself attending the royal lessons with the cream of the nobility, including his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4209/', "Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond")</script>, and Prince Edward. Consequently he received the finest humanist education available. He could speak English fluently within only a few years and learned Latin and several other languages, including French. He was a member of Edward's household as heir apparent and then king, being among his nine henchmen, the most intimate circle of youths attendant on the king.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick's relative poverty and his father's obscure peerage distinguished him from the more prestigious henchmen but he became close friends with Edward. As the king's whipping boy, he received physical punishment for his friend's transgressions. Being a courtier did have its advantages, though. He participated fully in court life and ceremonial and was well provided for. On 16 December 1549 he received &#145;iiij Shurtts wroughte with bandds of divers colored silke&#146;, a handkerchief embroidered with gold and silver, &#145;with like buttons and tassells for them&#146;, and &#145;ij grosse of silke ribain&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/84, fol. 4<i>v</i>). John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, recognized the value of this close friend and had Fitzpatrick sworn a gentleman of the king's privy chamber in August 1551. Later that year Edward dispatched Fitzpatrick to France so that he might finish his education, perfect his French, and observe continental politics and warfare. The sojourn, fully financed by the king, was a resounding success. Sir William Cecil, king's secretary, whose care Fitzpatrick believed to be &#145;more fatherly than friendly&#146;, spoke highly of his conduct and Henri II appointed him a gentleman of his chamber  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1547&#150;53</i>, 210, 232). Edward, moreover, maintained regular correspondence with him, revealing an intimate friendship that went beyond shared childhood experience; Fitzpatrick, it seemed, was destined for an influential position at the king's court. In December 1552 he was granted permission to visit the English court <i>en route</i> for Ireland where his father had been taken ill. His future prospects, however, were dashed by Edward's death in July 1553 and the religious volte-face that followed. An ardent protestant, Fitzpatrick was injured in an embarrassing fracas, involving Ormond and others, with a priest. He none the less aided in the suppression of Wyatt's rebellion (1553&#150;4), but without a patron or landed interests in England he was forced to make his future in Ireland, returning there with the earls of Kildare and Ormond in 1554.<br>
<br>Mary I summoned Fitzpatrick to court in late 1555, but&#151;as <i>de facto</i> head of the family during his father's illness&#151;he was unable to attend, as events in Upper Ossory necessitated his continued presence. He participated in the siege of Leith in March 1560. In the same year Fitzpatrick married his cousin Joan, daughter of Rowland Eustace, Viscount Baltinglass, and Joan, daughter of Sir James Butler of Dunboyne, with whom he had an only daughter, Margaret. His father, though ill, had married as his second wife Elizabeth, Brian O'Connor's daughter. She harboured deep resentment for Fitzpatrick, even turning his father against him. Sir Thomas Wroth, an Edwardian colleague, writing in October 1564, praised Fitzpatrick for rescuing a prey from the O'Mores of Laois, but noted &#145;he livith here in continewall peril, for he bie the malice of his stepp mother&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/11/95). He supported Sir Henry Sidney, another former Edwardian, now lord deputy, against Shane O'Neill in 1566 and was knighted by him. English officials expected much from Fitzpatrick and, in June 1568, granted him <i>in capite</i> his father's lands in Upper Ossory so that he might help bring order and civility to the embattled midlands. He sat in the parliament of 1568 and was appointed sheriff of Leix&#150;Offaly in 1569. Praise from government officials and many appointments to commissions, however, could not erase his long absence from local politics or establish the network of alliances that was so vital for political survival. Instead, Fitzpatrick was a conspicuous outsider, in danger of sinking into the morass of Irish politics.<br>
<br>In June 1571 a bitter feud that was to last a decade began between Fitzpatrick and Ormond. The feud, though temporarily defused by Fitzpatrick's admission that he had wrongly accused Ormond of spoiling his lands, erupted again in early 1573 when the Graces abducted his wife and daughter; Butler involvement was suspected and he resorted to illegal means to secure their return. He appealed to Sidney for redress but also employed the notorious felon Piers Grace who successfully stole back his daughter. Though his wife was returned unharmed and direct involvement by Ormond was never proven, Fitzpatrick and his brothers retaliated by spoiling Butler lands. In May 1574 Elizabeth I wrote:<blockquote>Surely if Sir Barnabe who has been so civily brought up here within our realm, even from his young years, should be found either author or committer of such barbarous acts, we cannot but adjudge him worthy of most severe punishment. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/46/21)</blockquote>Ormond, moreover, persistently accused Fitzpatrick, whom he deemed an unruly vassal, of committing depredations. In an effort to circumvent his influence, Fitzpatrick travelled to court in March 1575&#151;followed closely by letters from Ormond&#151;to plead his case with the queen. His efforts earned him a temporary reprieve. He succeeded his father as baron of Upper Ossory in 1575. His apprehension and murder of the notorious rebel Rory Oge O'More in June 1578 won him great praise and should have placed his loyalty beyond reproach. The outbreak of rebellion in Munster, however, allowed Ormond to level fresh allegations of complicity with the rebels against him. A cautious privy council summoned Upper Ossory to appear before it in May 1580. He appealed to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, another henchman of Edward, to intercede, but his brothers' drift toward the rebels coupled with his father-in-law's rebellion resulted in his and his wife's imprisonment in January 1581. Though Sir Henry Wallop, Irish vice-treasurer, questioned the validity of his imprisonment Upper Ossory languished in Dublin Castle. He was allowed more freedom but suddenly fell ill and died on 11 September 1581 in the house of William Kelly, a surgeon, in Dublin. He was probably buried there. The four masters note:<blockquote>neach eissidhe tuccadh suas I Saxoibh as a &oacute;icce, agus bao&iacute; foghlamtha i ccaidreabh agus i ccomhaonta na c&uacute;irte gur bh&oacute; hionrnadh l&aacute; h&eacute;ireandchoibh uile a chongmail i ngeaimhel go ro &eacute;cc.(he was a man who had been brought up in England in his youth, and who was acquainted with the manners and customs of the court, so that it was a wonder to the Irish that he should have been detained in bondage until his death. <span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1581)</blockquote>Sidney lamented his death. His brother Florence succeeded him as third baron of Upper Ossory; his widow was still alive in 1585.<br>
