<span class="headword">Moore,  Arthur William</span>  (1853&#150;1909), <span class="occ">historian and Manx scholar</span>, born on 6 February 1853 at Cronkbourne, Douglas, Isle of Man, was the eldest of the ten children (five sons and five daughters) of William Fine Moore (1814&#150;1895) JP, proprietor of the Tromode Sailcloth Mills and, from 1857 to 1875, a member of the House of Keys (self-elected until the reforms of 1866), and his wife and cousin, Hannah Christian (1827&#150;1914). The Moores, of Ballakilley, Marown, a leading family of ancient and complicated lineage, were rooted in the island, and Moore claimed descent from the Christians of Milntown and the Manx patriotic hero William Christian, Illiam Dh&ocirc;ne (1608&#150;1663), through both his mother and his father. After Rugby School, which he entered in February 1867, he went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1872 and was bracketed first in the historical tripos in 1875; he graduated BA in 1877 and MA in 1880. He also distinguished himself at athletics and won his blue for rugby football. He married, on 24 February 1887, Louisa Elizabeth Wynn (1864&#150;1937), the daughter of Dr Joshua Hughes-Games, then archdeacon of Man and later vicar of Hull.<br>
<br>Following extensive travel in Europe, Asia, and the West Indies in the early 1870s Moore devoted his adult activities to the concerns of his native island. In business he followed his father in the profitable management of the Tromode Sailcloth Mills, until the competition of steamships inevitably led to their decline and eventual closure. He developed the family farms, and his interest in advancing Manx agricultural practices, particularly his attempt to introduce high quality cheesemaking, was marked by his membership and, in 1883, his presidency of the Isle of Man Agricultural Society. He was also a director of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and the Isle of Man Banking Company, the two most important commercial institutions in the island's resort development of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Moore began his life in public service on his appointment as a justice of the peace at the age of twenty-four, and in 1881, at the age of twenty-eight, he was made captain of the parish of Onchan and elected a member of the House of Keys for the sheading of Middle, which he represented for the rest of his life. He served as a member of the Manx council of education, the Manx Harbour Board, and the Manx diocesan church commissioners and was appointed deputy receiver-general in 1905. An authority on the procedures and precedents of the House of Keys, in 1898 he was elected its speaker, a post he held until his death. A staunch defender of the Keys' rights and privileges against their erosion by the governor and legislative council, he guided the house's first moves in the battle for constitutional reform towards Manx home rule with ability, tenacity, and tact. He led the first Keys' deputation on that issue to the Home Office in February 1907, when his health was already in decline.<br>
<br>Moore's achievements in business and political life were notable but they were overshadowed by the range and quality of his services to Manx cultural and intellectual life in a relatively short career. His rigorously professional, record-based <span class="italic">History of the Isle of Man</span> (1900) continues at the end of the twentieth century to underpin most historical investigations, and his many works on the language, music, and social culture, published on the island and in Britain, are the foundations of modern Manx studies, the essential scholarly basis for the definition of the particular Norse and Celtic-influenced national identity of the Manx. They include <span class="italic">The Surnames and Place-Names of the Isle of Man</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man</span> (1891), <span class="italic">Manx Carols</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Diocese of Sodor and Man</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Manx Ballads and Music</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Manx Worthies</span> (1901), <span class="italic">Bishop Hildesley's Letters</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Douglas 100 Years Ago</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">Extracts from the Records of the Isle of Man</span> (1905). He edited the elegant illustrated periodical the <span class="italic">Manx Notebook</span> (1885&#150;7) and contributed many articles to that and other learned magazines.<br>
<br>Moore learned Manx in adult life at a time when it was unfashionable and undervalued by the educated classes, and his keen interest in the language linked him with the popular, native-speaking side of the movement for Manx studies as well as the scholarly antiquarians of the Manx Society for the Publication of Historical Documents, the Fine Arts and Industrial Guild, the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society, and the trustees of the projected Manx National Museum, all of which he actively supported. In 1899 he founded the Manx Language Society, which drew all the elements of Manx culture together. Influenced by the example of the Welsh eisteddfod, it was not confined to the pursuit of language studies, but defined in his first presidential address to the society (November 1899) as dedicated &#145;to the preservation of everything that is distinctively Manx, and above all to the cultivation of a national spirit&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1902 Moore was created commander in the Royal Victorian Order by Edward VII on a visit to the island and in 1905 he was enthroned as bard at Caernarfon, gratifying acknowledgements of the two sides of his life's work, in politics, and as a leader of the Manx cultural revival. He was still speaker and still working on his latest project, &#145;The vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx dialect&#146;, in spite of prolonged ill health, when he died at his home, Woodbourne House, Douglas, on 12 November 1909 at the age of fifty-six. He was buried at Kirk Braddan on 15 November. He left one son and two daughters.<br>
