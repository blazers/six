<span class="headword">Bourchier,  Henry</span>, first earl of Essex  (<em>c.</em>1408&#150;1483), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50242/', "Sir William Bourchier, count of Eu (c.1374&#150;1420)")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54430/', "Anne of Woodstock (c.1382&#150;1438)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27197/', "Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester")</script>, and widow of two earls of Stafford. Although he was a great-grandson of Robert Bourchier, first Lord Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1349), the first lay chancellor, Henry Bourchier was not in the direct line of succession to the barony of Bourchier, since his grandfather was Lord Robert's younger son. He was half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26207/', "Humphrey Stafford, duke of Buckingham")</script>, and elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2993/', "Thomas, Cardinal Bourchier")</script>, William, Lord Fitzwarine, John, Lord Berners, and Eleanor, duchess of Norfolk, all of whom benefited considerably from their mother's royal and aristocratic connections. In 1420 Henry succeeded his father in the French <i>comt&eacute;</i> of Eu, but not yet in the estates in Essex and Suffolk brought to his family by his paternal grandmother, Eleanor Lovaine, for these remained in his mother's possession until her death. He was knighted at Leicester in May 1426, and after obtaining a papal dispensation he married, on 15 October following, at St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1484), the daughter of Richard, earl of Cambridge, and Anne, daughter of Roger Mortimer, earl of March. Isabel was the sister of Richard, duke of York (who gave her an annuity of &pound;100), and the widow of Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton.<br>
<br>Bourchier's service as a military commander began the next year in the duke of Bedford's army in France, and he subsequently also took part in Henry VI's coronation expedition of 1430. Three years later, on the death without children of his kinswoman, Elizabeth, Lady Bourchier, he succeeded to the barony of Bourchier, and was henceforth summoned to parliament either as Lord Bourchier or (as in 1435) as count of Eu. When translating the latter title into English he referred to himself as &#145;earl&#146;, but contemporaries did not accord him precedence above his fellow barons. He may have taken part in the duke of Gloucester's expedition to relieve Calais in 1436, and in 1439 he was one of the diplomatic envoys sent there for peace negotiations. In 1441 he crossed the channel again, this time with a large force in support of his brother-in-law York, who appointed him captain of Neufch&acirc;tel and governor-general of the marches of Picardy. Before their departure from England Bourchier also contracted to serve for seven years as captain of the important border fortress of Le Crotoy. The crisis at the exchequer brought about by over-assignment of revenues meant that payment of his salary, set at &pound;1000 p.a., quickly fell into arrears and he was long the crown's creditor, although he eventually recouped some of his losses when he took over as treasurer of England. As reward for his military services he was created Viscount Bourchier during the parliament of 1445&#150;6, and elected knight of the Garter on his third nomination in 1452.<br>
<br>The influence of Buckingham, who always stayed loyal to Henry VI, perhaps counterbalanced Bourchier's links with the increasingly dissatisfied York, whom he served as a councillor. During York's first protectorate in 1454 he assumed a prominent role as a member of the royal council, working in close association with his brother, Thomas, now archbishop of Canterbury, and that summer he was sent to Calais to conduct difficult negotiations with the mutinous garrison. Although it is unclear whether he fought at the battle of St Albans on the Yorkist side, or, intending to do so, arrived the next day in company with his other brother-in-law, Norfolk, he was appointed treasurer just a week later, on 29 May 1455. He and his brother Thomas, the chancellor, both held office until October 1456, when they were &#145;sodenly discharged&#146; owing to pressure brought to bear on the king by Margaret of Anjou  (Davis, 2.165). Certain of Bourchier's sons were retained by their uncle York, but it was not until two of them were attainted with the duke in the parliament of 1459 that Bourchier himself came out in open support of the Yorkist exiles. He fought on their side at Northampton in July 1460, and immediately after their victory he was again appointed treasurer. Even so, he probably did not favour the outright deposition of Henry VI until after the deaths of York and his own son, Edward, at Wakefield in December 1460. He fled the battlefield at St Albans in February 1461 after the Lancastrians won the day, and was among those who set Edward, then earl of March (his wife's nephew), on the throne on 3 March 1461, and advanced with him to Towton.<br>
<br>Edward IV, as he had thus become, confirmed Bourchier in office as treasurer, and on 30 June 1461 created him earl of Essex. His close attendance on the king brought him considerable royal patronage, notably grants of estates forfeited by the earls of Wiltshire and Oxford, in part to compensate him and his wife for an unfulfilled bequest of Isabel's uncle Edmund, earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1425), whose heir was now king. Although replaced as treasurer in April 1462, in the next year he carried out important administrative work at Calais and served on an embassy to St Omer for negotiations with France and Burgundy. As steward of the household for at least three years from May 1467 or earlier he stood by Edward throughout the political crises of the late 1460s, and was arrested when Henry VI was restored in the autumn of 1470. After secretly working for Edward's reinstatement and mediating between him and his rebellious brother, Clarence, he raised Essex in his support in April 1471. Having welcomed Edward back to London, he substantially reinforced the royal army, in which, at Barnet, his son and heir apparent, Humphrey, Lord Cromwell, was killed. He then successfully defended the capital against the Kentish rebels led by Thomas Neville, the Bastard of Fauconberg. The influence of Bourchier's family in south-east England was of critical importance for the re-establishment of Edward IV's authority and the stability of the second part of his reign. Edward placed a heavy reliance on his uncle, not only as a councillor and in military matters (as when, in 1473, Bourchier forced the earl of Oxford to re-embark following his landing at St Osyth), but as treasurer and chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster in the south for the full twelve years. Bourchier acted temporarily as keeper of the great seal in 1473 during the chancellor's illness. This was evidently a time of prosperity for him, for he profited from his offices, in particular the treasurership, and from his investments in overseas trade. He dealt extensively in wool and cloth produced on his own estates, as well as in Cornish tin, and imported luxury goods from the Mediterranean. The king confirmed him and his countess in possession of the lordship of Tyndale and Wark, Northumberland, settled on Isabel long before by her uncle Edward, duke of York, and Bourchier's inherited estates gave him at least &pound;1400 a year.<br>
<br>Bourchier died on 4 April 1483, just five days before the king, and was buried at Beeleigh Abbey. His tomb, which later also housed his widow (who survived until 2 October 1484), was subsequently removed to Little Easton church. In furtherance of his dynastic ambitions he had acquired wives for his sons from the ranks of the peerage. Henry (<i>d</i>. 1458) was matched with Elizabeth, daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24776/', "Thomas Scales, seventh Baron Scales")</script>, and Humphrey with a niece and coheir of Ralph, Lord Cromwell; while Sir John and Sir Thomas both married rich widows, those of Lord Ferrers of Groby and Humphrey Stafford, earl of Devon. But four of his six sons predeceased him, three of them without surviving children, so he was succeeded by a grandson, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2988/', "Henry Bourchier")</script>, the child of his eldest surviving son William and Anne Woodville, the queen's sister.<br>
