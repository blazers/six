<span class="headword">Puseley,  Daniel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Frank Foster]</span>  (1814&#150;1882), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Bideford, Devon, on 9 February 1814, the son of Henry Puseley, maltster, and was educated at Bideford grammar school until the age of fifteen, when, having been left &#145;without parental protection and guidance&#146;  (Puseley, <span class="italic">Faith, Hope, and Charity</span>, 1863, 21), he took up a clerkship at a large wholesale establishment in London. For several years thereafter he attended evening classes at a literary and scientific institute near the General Post Office in order to supplement his elementary education.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1844, after a period as a commercial traveller, Puseley married Mary Anne, daughter of John Darlington, a London builder, and in the same year he set up as a hosier and silk merchant in Gutter Lane. He was soon, however, &#145;compelled to close his shutters&#146;  (Puseley, <span class="italic">Dependence or Independence</span>, 16), finding that a successful business career was incompatible with literary ambition. His first book, a moralistic novella entitled <span class="italic">Harry Mustifer</span> (1847), sold only twelve copies in its first year and Puseley thereafter interspersed creative projects (such as <span class="italic">Five Dramas</span>, 1854, a forlorn attempt to purge the English stage of foreign influence) with the compilation of solidly factual handbooks such as <span class="italic">The Commercial Companion for the United Kingdom</span> (1858; 3rd edn, 1860), and <span class="italic">The Traveller's Assistant</span> (1867). He also produced, often using the pseudonym Frank Foster and, later, An Old Author, a long succession of pamphlets on a wide range of topical themes and, encouraged by the success of his acquaintance Albert Smith, he established a reputation as a comic lecturer at the Royal Polytechnic Institution and elsewhere. By these means, Puseley contrived to build up a modest competence with which to support his growing family (he and his wife had four sons: Herbert John; Berkeley Edward, a journalist who assisted his father in some of his later work; Percy Daniel; and Sydney George).<br>
<br>In 1854 Puseley travelled to Australia and New Zealand for his health, making a second trip in 1857. These journeys resulted both in his most interesting poem, a narrative of high society entitled <span class="italic">The Wave of Life</span> (1857), and in his most commercially successful book, <span class="italic">The Rise and Progress of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand</span> (1857), which quickly went through five editions. In addition to the usual barrage of practical information, Puseley provided an opinionated account of his own reactions. He found New Zealand &#145;the finest colony in the world&#146;  (p. 232), but Australia he pronounced &#145;the most objectionable of all British dependencies&#146;  (p. 231) and he took especial exception to Melbourne (&#145;a little hell upon earth&#146;; p. 4).<br>
<br>After his second return to England, Puseley's industry continued unabated, but his career as a lecturer was cut short by failing health and his attempts at fiction; <span class="italic">Our Premier</span> (1867), for example, a would-be sensation novel, and the rambling <span class="italic">All Round the World</span> (1876), met with scant success. In 1866 he lost a large part of his savings through injudicious investments, but efforts to procure a civil-list pension failed with the resignation of Lord Derby in 1868. He died on 18 January 1882 at 21 Rochester Road, Camden Town, London, where he had lived for many years and from which he had published much of his own work; he was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Puseley devoted much of his time to charitable causes and was a lifelong champion of education for the poor. His greatest practical achievement in this field occurred on 18 December 1868, when he co-ordinated a ragged schools festival in St James's Hall, at which 600 selected children were presented with prizes. Although Puseley's writings seldom rise above the level of hack work, he exemplifies, in his industry and independence, the virtues of self-help he so strenuously championed.<br>
