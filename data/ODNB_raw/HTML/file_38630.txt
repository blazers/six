<span class="headword">Paley,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1808), <span class="occ">industrialist and entrepreneur</span>, was born in Langcliffe, Giggleswick, and baptized on 10 August 1746 at Giggleswick parish church in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the second of the four children of George Paley (1721&#150;1765), a freeholder, of Langcliffe Scar Farm, and his wife, Mary Lawson. The Paley family can be traced in Langcliffe for the two previous centuries. William Paley, the theologian, was Richard's cousin, and his uncle William (<i>d</i>. 1799) the incumbent of Giggleswick and sometime master of Giggleswick School. Nothing is known of his education or of an apprenticeship. He was already established as a soap-boiler in Leeds when the <span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span> of 25 June 1771 announced his marriage on 15 June at Otley to Mary Preston of Merebeck Hall, Giggleswick, &#145;an agreeable lady with a fortune of &pound;1000&#146;. In April 1775 the daughter of the squire of Langcliffe Hall, his &#145;cousin&#146; Mrs Margaret Cookson (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawson), provided him with further economic support by a forty-year lease of domestic and industrial buildings in open wharfside ground at Kirk Ing, next to the parish church of Leeds, part of the extensive Cookson estate. In February 1776 these, improved and valued for fire insurance at &pound;1700, were the basis of a mortgage from his elder brother Thomas, who remained a source of further loans by mortgages throughout Richard's lifetime. From October 1777 Middleton colliery began to supply coal for Paley's malthouse and soap works on this site.<br>
<br>The Paleys' first child, Mary, was born on 3 September 1772, when they were still living in Meadow Lane, Hunslet, but from October 1776 Paley began to attend as a juror at the manor court of Leeds Kirkgate. Nine other children were born between 1777 and 1788 at a house at Kirk Ing, &#145;next the Old Church Yard&#146;, though five died in infancy. From November 1778 Paley owned seats in a new gallery at the church.<br>
<br>In November 1780 Paley made his first purchases of land alongside the Aire Navigation at Knostrop (Knowesthorp), east of Leeds, where he later transferred the soap works and his own residence to new premises which he named Gibraltar. Even more significant for his future activities as a property developer was a contract of October 1786 to pay &pound;255 for Coneyshaws, a close of 3 acres adjoining the York turnpike at Marsh Lane, on the eastern fringe of the town. There, and in other fields nearby, Paley became the town's largest landlord of working-class houses. By 1803 he owned 275 houses, generally back-to-backs of two storeys with separate cellar dwellings beneath, arranged in terraces with courtyards behind.<br>
<br>&#145;Mr Paley and Mr Dade [a raff merchant of Otley] purchased the above Estates with the sole View of parcelling them out in Building Lots&#146;, began a note  (W. Yorks. AS, Leeds, DB 233) prepared after Dade's death early in May 1803 and Paley's bankruptcy on 21 May. At that time 56 of the 67 acres acquired by the partners between 1787 and 1803 still remained in lots unsold; a measure of their over-optimism was the twenty years that the assignees in bankruptcy then took to market these lots.<br>
<br>Paley's bankruptcy was not due solely to failed building speculation. His mortgages, of &pound;8170, from banks in Malton, Huddersfield, and Pontefract had been obtained on the security of other property ventures in Leeds and beyond. He had brought cotton spinning to Leeds by building two cotton mills at Bank Top as early as 1790, that is, before the flax mill of John Marshall and the woollen mill of Benjamin Gott. One mill was intended for letting, and in the other the partnership of Holdforth, Wilkinson, Paley &amp; Co. installed steam engines for spinning cotton. In 1795 James Watt jun. was sent to spy on these for infringement of patent, and under duress a 36 hp Soho-made engine machine was ordered the following year (but seems not to have been delivered). In November 1798 Paley contracted to build a flax mill in Marsh Lane, Leeds, to be tenanted by G. and J. Wright, and another, complete with steam engine, in 1801; nearby he built premises for the ironsmith Cawood, another for the whitesmith Farmery, and a nail works for Liddle &amp; Co. In 1793 he became landlord of a water-powered frizzing mill at Mill Garth and nearby, at Lady Bridge, the workshops that became Brumfitt's carpet factory. He also built smaller premises to be leased, including cloth-dressing shops, and at Skinner Lane he built a fine pair of three-storey bay-fronted houses, with workshops behind, as residences for cloth merchants still dependent on handicraftsmen. In addition he built riverside warehouses to rent to corn merchants and others.<br>
<br>Paley became a partner in enterprises further afield: in ironworks at Fall Ings, Wakefield (1787&#150;92); in the cotton mill of King, Turner, Varden, Paley &amp; Co. at Mytholmroyd, near Halifax (by 1790); in the new Bowling ironworks at Bradford (1787), in which he had a quarter share; in three cotton mills at Colne, Lancashire (1797); and in a potash works at Bristol, which supplied the Paley soap works. He also made overtures for a soap works at Oban in Scotland and the supply of kelp from there to Leeds.<br>
<br>Paley was elected a member of the closed tory Leeds corporation on 29 September 1789; he was a shareholder in the new private subscription library from 1770 and in the Leeds waterworks, and a subscriber to the Leeds General Infirmary from 1785. His name frequently appeared in the press at the head of charity subscription lists for Kirkgate ward, where in November 1803, six months after his bankruptcy, he subscribed 10 guineas for the relief of the poor. In the currency shortage of small coins in 1791 he placed orders with Boulton and Watt for copper coins bearing his name to be put into circulation in Leeds, and in March 1797 he publicly guaranteed his acceptance of Bank of England notes. He more than once took over property as claimant against local bankrupts indebted to him in the course of trade or to whom he had lent money on mortgage.<br>
<br>After his bankruptcy Paley resigned from the borough council, leaving no other record until his death at Knostrop, &#145;from inflamation&#146;, on 24 November 1808; he was buried on the 26th in St Peter's churchyard, Leeds. He was intestate, the Gibraltar works being already in trust for his eldest son, George (1779&#150;1828). At first the trustees expected to raise &pound;50,000 as well as a dividend of 20<i>s</i>. in the pound for all creditors, but the first dividend of 1804 was only 2<i>s</i>. in the pound. A further small dividend was paid in 1809, with an additional contribution from his nephew John Green Paley. A settlement was made with Dade's heir in March 1807. The original trustees in bankruptcy were stormily replaced in December 1814, and intermittent land sales continued until 1823.<br>
<br>No street or mill perpetuated Paley's name in the town where he had built its first textile mills, although, until they disappeared under railway sidings, Paley's Galleries in Marsh Lane were a reminder that he also pioneered a style of high-density, low-cost housing that, together with the mill smoke, gave the town a classic east end. His bankruptcy showed an aspect of entrepreneurial fortunes that were as characteristic of the industrial revolution as its successes.<br>
