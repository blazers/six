<span class="headword">McGhee,  Richard</span>  (1851&#150;1930), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Lurgan in Ulster in late January or early February 1851, the eldest of three sons of protestant parents, Richard and Alice McGhee. He was baptized on 12 February 1851. His father was a poor tenant farmer on the estate of Lord Lurgan, but later opened a general store in Lurgan. After attending the local school in Lurgan, at twenty years of age Richard moved to Glasgow where he served a seven-year engineering apprenticeship. On 20 July 1880 he married Mary (1857&#150;1949), the daughter of George Campbell, a pattern-maker, and his wife, Catherine; they had five sons and a daughter. In the same year as his marriage McGhee started an unsuccessful small engineering business with his brother George. He then became a commercial traveller in cutlery and stationery, a profitable activity that sustained him throughout his working life.<br>
<br>In Glasgow, McGhee became involved in radical Irish and Scottish politics and in 1879 established a lifelong friendship with Michael Davitt, the Irish nationalist and founder of the Irish Land League. Henry George, the American radical, proved to be an even greater influence and McGhee remained a committed Georgeite throughout his life, supporting a single tax on land to end the excesses of landlordism.<br>
<br>By the mid-1880s McGhee had established a reputation as a man of principle, acute intelligence, and singular debating skills in the cause of Irish home rule, the campaign for land reform, and the spread of Georgeite radicalism. He was a founder member of the Scottish Land Restoration League in 1884 in support of the crofters' agitation. The universality of George's message and his belief that the problems of the Irish could be solved only by alliance with the British working class encouraged McGhee to assist unorganized, unskilled workers in England and Scotland.<br>
<br>McGhee became involved in trade unionism during the 1880s through the American Knights of Labor, a general union which established branches in Britain. He was briefly a Knights of Labor organizer assisting the nail- and chain-makers of Cradley Heath in the midlands from 1887 and was subsequently sent to Glasgow on a recruiting campaign. It was during a waterfront dispute there in early 1889 that the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) was formed and McGhee was invited to become honorary president with Edward McHugh as general secretary.<br>
<br>The new union rapidly established branches in Scotland, Ireland, and north-west England, surviving substantial disputes in Glasgow in 1889 and Liverpool in 1890. McGhee, unpaid and part-time, was less prominent than McHugh but he devoted considerable time and energy to the organization and policies of the new union. He played a part in developing ca'canny tactics in Glasgow and Liverpool and introduced the union &#145;button&#146;, a metal badge designed to fit into the lapel. These buttons were issued to paid-up members and changed quarterly: their absence identified non-members, encouraging them to enlist to avoid the hostility of fellow workers.<br>
<br>In 1893 both McGhee and McHugh resigned from the NUDL claiming their work had been completed, but their departure was hastened by sectional jealousies and branch indiscipline. McGhee nevertheless remained involved in the organization of waterfront workers. He was an executive council member of the International Federation of Ship, Dock and River Workers, an ambitious venture founded by Tom Mann in 1896 which, although less successful than had been hoped, was ultimately revived as the International Transport Workers' Federation. McGhee was also associated with the seamen's union for many years, helping to secure the extension of the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span> to seamen in 1906 and their inclusion in the <span class="roman">Health Insurance Act</span> of 1911. He attended the union's annual conferences and was elected an honorary member of the executive council and a trustee in 1911, holding the latter position until his death in 1930.<br>
<br>In spite of the time and energy McGhee spent in the cause of labour organization, his commitment to Irish nationalism remained unimpaired, and from the early 1890s he was involved in Irish parliamentary politics. In 1892 he was unsuccessful in securing the nationalist nomination for South Louth but, following the death of the successful candidate in 1896, he was nominated and won the seat in the consequent by-election. His campaign was based on the cause of home rule on advanced nationalist principles, the endorsement of Catholic demands on education, the complete abolition of landlordism, and support for labourers based upon his own &#145;humble efforts during the past ten years on behalf of the toiling masses&#146;. He was unexpectedly defeated in the election of 1900 but was again returned to parliament as the nationalist member for Mid-Tyrone in 1910. McGhee retained his seat until 1918, when the four constituencies of co. Tyrone were reduced to three, and he did not stand in the contest.<br>
<br>As an MP McGhee behaved as an orthodox nationalist member. He complained of the inequity of the taxation system and condemned the British during the South African War. During the First World War, however, the Irish nationalist party led by John Redmond lost credibility. McGhee loyally supported Redmond in his decision in 1914 to support the British war effort and in his condemnation of the Easter rising of 1916. The brutal reaction of the British government to the rising and the unsuccessful attempt to activate the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span> of 1914 which would have granted some measure of home rule finally destroyed Redmond and the constitutional movement. In the circumstances it is not surprising that McGhee did not seek re-election in 1918.<br>
<br>McGhee died at his home, 3 Hayburn Crescent, Partickhill, Glasgow, on 7 April 1930, aged seventy-nine, and was buried in Glasgow on 10 April. He had been in indifferent health for some time and, following a visit to England on seamen's business, he became ill and died of pneumonia within a fortnight. He was survived by his wife. His youngest son, appropriately named Henry George McGhee, was Labour MP for the Penistone division of Yorkshire from 1935 until his death in 1959.<br>
<br>An important figure in the cause of Irish nationalism, McGhee also contributed to the development of an influential Georgeite movement in Britain during the 1880s. He believed strongly in bringing together the Irish and British working classes, whose common experience of exploitation was of greater importance than divisive factors of nationality and religion. His earlier career as a trade union organizer was also noteworthy.<br>
