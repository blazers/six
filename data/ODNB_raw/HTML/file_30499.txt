<span class="headword">Attwell <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Earnshaw]</span>,  Mabel Lucie</span>  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">illustrator</span>, was born at 182 Mile End Road, London, on 4 June 1879, the sixth child of Augustus Attwell, a butcher, of Mile End, and his wife, (Emily) Ann, the daughter of George Harris, a coach builder. Attwell was educated privately and at the Coopers' Company School, where she showed an early talent for art. She later attended classes at Regent Street and Heatherley's art schools, but disliked the heavy emphasis placed on still-life drawing and copying classical casts, and she did not remain there long. Her preference lay in making sketches and drawings of imaginary subjects, arising out of her enjoyment of fairy stories, and it was through these that she became known. The acceptance of drawings for publication in such magazines as <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> and <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> led her to show her work to the agents Francis and Mills, and although they held out little hope of success they found that her sketches sold readily at 20 guineas each. From that time on, almost to the end of her life, they played an important part in gaining commissions for her and encouraging her to apply her art to a variety of purposes.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1908 Attwell married the painter and illustrator Harold Cecil Earnshaw (1886&#150;1937) with whom she had a daughter in 1909 and two sons in 1911 and 1914. One of her sons died in 1935. The appearance of one, two, or three of these children in drawings on the preliminary pages of her early illustrated gift books can serve as a rough guide to the sequence in which volumes&#151;always undated&#151;were published. During the First World War Earnshaw was badly wounded, losing his right arm, and running the family and business affairs thus devolved largely upon his wife. It was a responsibility which accorded well with Attwell's temperament, for this handsome woman was strong-willed and dedicated to her work, and she continued to develop and exploit an illustrative mode which brought her national fame. She had few interests outside her preoccupation with her family and her work, and she remained active as an artist, under her maiden name, to the end of her life.<br>
<br>Attwell's career as an illustrator began with work done for magazines, which was always to be her standby. Around the turn of the century, however, she started to receive commissions from the publishing firm of W. and R. Chambers, and this led her into the field of book illustration. Initially she provided colour designs for trade bindings (for example, in M. Howitt's <span class="italic">The Steadfast Gabriel</span>, <i>c</i>.1900) and sets of monochrome plates for children's stories (for example, in May Baldwin's <span class="italic">That Little Limb</span>, 1905). Before long, however, she was asked to undertake more ambitious work for the <span class="roman">Raphael House Library of Gift Books</span>, published by Messrs Raphael Tuck. Her earliest volumes in the series were <span class="italic">Mother Goose</span> (<i>c</i>.1909) and <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span> (1910). In these books she was required to provide line-drawings printed in the text and colour work for twelve full-page half-tone plates, a formula which was followed in later additions to the series: <span class="italic">Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales</span> (1913), an abridged version of <span class="italic">The Water Babies</span> (1915), <span class="italic">Children's Stories from French Fairy Tales</span>, by Doris Ashley (1917), and <span class="italic">Grimms' Fairy Tales</span> (1925).<br>
<br>Attwell's illustrations for these gift books won the admiration of Queen Mary of Romania, a prolific writer (in English) of books and short stories for children. In 1922 Attwell was invited to spend several weeks at the royal palace in Bucharest, and she also illustrated two long stories by the queen which were published in a large gift-book format: <span class="italic">Peeping Pansy</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">The Lost Princess</span> (1924). The publisher of these, Hodder and Stoughton, also commissioned a set of illustrations for Sir J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Peter Pan and Wendy</span>, which was issued in a gift-book edition in 1921 and remained in print in various less ornate styles of production until the 1970s.<br>
<br>Almost all Attwell's early book illustration was derivative. The early work for Chambers echoed that of her fellow illustrators Hilda Cowham (a personal friend) and Jessie Willcox Smith, and the gift-book illustrations were modelled on the work of other contemporary exponents of that genre&#151;John Hassall and the brothers Charles and William Heath Robinson. A poster which she designed for London Transport, and which may be numbered among the first of their very successful &#145;Travel by Underground&#146; series (<i>c</i>.1918), owes a considerable debt to the work of John Hassall.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most successful book of her whole career&#151;the 1910 <span class="italic">Alice</span>&#151;is the one in which Attwell was able to combine the linear strength of such artists with her own feeling for child gesture and homely detail, but before long she began to exploit the latter in a way which, while leading to wide commercial success, was at the cost of compositional values and the integrity of illustration and text to be illustrated. In such books as <span class="italic">The Water Babies</span>, <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span>, and <span class="italic">Grimms' Fairy Tales</span> the graphic design was weakened through the introduction of too many extraneous elves and gauzy fairies, while the content of the portraiture in the pictures often ran counter to the intentions of the text.<br>
<br>At the heart of this decline in the character of her book illustrations lay Attwell's growing reputation as an artist who could gratify adult susceptibilities towards the &#145;cuteness&#146; of children. Rotund and cuddly infants had appeared in her early gift books, but they were also to be found in her magazine illustrations and in the long series of picture postcards which she designed for Valentine &amp; Sons of Dundee from about 1914. Here she met the needs of a period when childhood was widely sentimentalized (as shown by the success of other artists such as Margaret Tarrant, and writers such as Marion St John Webb), and during the 1920s and 1930s Mabel Lucie Attwell children were ubiquitous. They figured on all kinds of nursery equipment, from calendars and nursery pictures to crockery and Chad Valley dolls, which were made from models which Attwell prepared in Plasticine. They appeared regularly in the <span class="italic">Lucie Attwell Annual</span>, which ran from 1922 to 1974&#151;and the fact that this serial continued for ten years after her death shows how her stories or pictures might be reused. From 1924 a complex series of <span class="roman">Lucie Attwell Picture Books</span>, and books such as the <span class="italic">Lucie Attwell Rainy Day Tales</span> (1931), were published, where previously published tales and pictures might be &#145;bulked&#146;, that is, selected promiscuously from the annuals or from other picture books and reproduced as they first appeared, or even with the pictures in reduced sizes or uncoloured, as in <span class="italic">Lucie Attwell's Great Big Midget Book</span> (1934). Play books such as the doll-dressing album <span class="italic">Peggy</span> (1921) and painting books (1934 onwards) were also published.<br>
<br>Probably the happiest form in which Attwell's distinctive child pictures may be found is in individual pictures in some of her annuals and in her postcards. There the opportunity for cartoonist's wit, or even for self-parody, gives life to the subject. However, her delicate drawing in line and watercolour was often sadly coarsened by mass-production printing methods. Like the artist Kate Greenaway before her, Attwell exerted a considerable influence in adult reactions to children, which was not just to be found in her idealization of childhood as a time of dimpled, if cheeky, innocence, but also&#151;for small girls anyway&#151;in her creation, rather than reflection, of new fashions in dress and in the bobbing of hair. She died at her home, 3 St Fimbarrus Road, Fowey, Cornwall, on 5 November 1964. Her business was carried on by her daughter, Marjorie (known as Peggy), who had helped her in her later years. A centenary exhibition was held in her honour at the Brighton Museum between December 1979 and January 1980.<br>
