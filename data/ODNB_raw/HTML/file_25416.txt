<span class="headword">Shippard,  Alexander</span>  (1771&#150;1841), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 3 March 1771, the youngest son of Alexander Shippard (<i>d</i>. 1803), a purser in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Margaret Walkinshaw. The father was with Horatio Nelson in the <i>Vanguard</i> in 1798 and received a medal for the battle of Abu Qir Bay. The younger Shippard entered the navy in 1786 on the <i>Irresistible</i>, bearing the broad pennant of Sir Andrew Snape Hamond. From 1788 to 1792 he served in the <i>Scipio</i>, <i>Bellerophon</i>, and <i>Vengeance</i>&#151;all in the English Channel. In 1792 he went out to Newfoundland in the <i>Assistance</i>, and on 23 October 1793 he was promoted lieutenant in command of the tender <i>Placentia</i>. In 1795 and 1796 he served in the storeship <i>Camel</i> in the Mediterranean; in 1797 he took command of the <i>Monarch</i> and cut out vessels off Texel, the Netherlands; subsequently, to 1801, he was in the <i>Montagu</i>, for the most part in the Mediterranean but afterwards in the West Indies.<br>
<br>In 1801&#150;2 Shippard was in the <i>Monarch</i> in the North Sea, and in 1803 he commanded the cutter <i>Admiral Mitchell</i> (12 guns) attached to the fleet under Lord Keith to guard the narrow seas. On 21 August 1803 he landed Georges Cadoudal, the Chouan leader, at Biville, between Dieppe and Tr&eacute;port, and on 16 January the following year he landed the French general Pichegru at the same place. On 31 October 1803, with the advanced squadron off Boulogne, he ran inshore and engaged a gun-brig in charge of six sloops, some of which were armed. After an action of two and a half hours, during which the squadron was prevented by the contrary wind from giving him assistance, he drove the brig and one of the sloops on shore. Following Keith's report on this, Shippard received a sword of honour from the patriotic fund at Lloyd's and was promoted commander on 3 March 1804. He was later appointed to the <i>Hornet</i> in the West Indies.<br>
<br>In 1805 Shippard commanded the <i>Surinam</i> in the Mediterranean, and on 22 January 1806 he was advanced to post rank. In May 1807 he was appointed to the <i>Banterer</i> (22 guns), which, by the culpable negligence of the lieutenant of the middle watch and of the master who both went to drink grog in the gun room, was lost in the St Lawrence River on the night of 29 October 1808. The court martial found that Shippard had made every possible exertion to save the ship, and afterwards to preserve the stores. He was acquitted of all blame and was shortly afterwards appointed to the <i>Namur</i> (74 guns), flagship of Vice-Admiral Thomas Wells at the Nore. In 1812&#150;13 he commanded the <i>Asia</i> (74 guns) in the North Sea. He had no further service but became rear-admiral on 28 June 1838, received a pension for meritorious service, and died at Malta on 4 April 1841. Shippard married Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15728/', "Admiral Sir John Knight")</script>, and they had at least one child.<br>
<br>Shippard's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_25417"></a><span class="headword">William Shippard</span>  (1764&#150;1856), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 17 February 1764 near Bo'ness, Linlithgowshire, and entered the navy on the <i>Medea</i> in June 1778. He was on the <i>Nonsuch</i> in the West Indies in 1782 and served in the battle of 9 April. In August 1797 he was at the blockade of Cadiz, under Lord St Vincent, and in the subsequent battle. In 1801 he served in the battle of Copenhagen. He was advanced to post rank and placed on the retired list in 1846, and died, without children, on 6 July 1856.<br>
