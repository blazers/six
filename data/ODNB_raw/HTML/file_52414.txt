<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newman,  Edward Arthur</span>  (1918&#150;1993), <span class="occ">computer engineer</span>, was born on 27 April 1918 at 9 Coleridge Road, Walthamstow, London, the elder of the two sons of Edward Charles Newman, a manual worker and later a postal sorter, and his wife, Amy Cecilia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harvie. He was educated at Kingsbury county school (1929&#150;36), and at University College, London, from where he graduated BSc in physics in 1939. He then started research aimed ultimately at the degree of PhD, but this work was suspended because of the war and never completed, and after a brief period working for Masteradio Ltd he joined the research laboratories of Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (later EMI) at Hayes, Middlesex, in 1941. This was to prove a crucial move because he was assigned to work with a genius in electronic circuit design, Alan D. Blumlein, who was developing an airborne radar system known as H<sub>2</sub>S. Newman gained a thorough knowledge of Blumlein's distinctive rigorous approach to circuit design, and of the ingenious circuits he had developed to handle the streams of pulses of current which were used to generate the outgoing pulsed radio signal and to represent the reflected incoming signal. When Blumlein was killed in an air crash in June 1942 while testing H<sub>2</sub>S, Newman took over responsibility for part of the subsequent production of operational radar sets, and for the training of those testing them; after the war he worked on the development of advanced circuits for television cameras. Meanwhile, on 9 September 1944 he married a schoolfriend, Helen Maud Green (1920/21&#150;<i>c</i>.1988), daughter of Alfred Green, a clerk. There were three sons and one daughter of the marriage.<br>
<br>In September 1947 Newman left EMI to move to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington. There Alan Turing, later well known for his wartime work on code-breaking, had produced a brilliant outline design for a stored-program electronic digital computer in late 1945, which was ahead of all other such work in the world at that time. Newman was recruited to provide the specialist knowledge needed to implement these plans, in which streams of pulses of current, and sound waves in a mercury tank, were used to represent the data and instructions in the computer. Turing soon left the NPL for a period of sabbatical leave from which he did not return, but the two had a month to get to know each other, discovering a common interest in cross-country running which they practised together. This friendship was maintained, and Newman later visited Turing several times in Manchester; both enjoyed debate, unconventional ideas, and a comfortably disorganized lifestyle. After Turing's departure the NPL assembled a balanced team to design and build a prototype computer based on his plans. F. M. Colebrook led the group, which combined the logical design skills of J. H. Wilkinson, D. W. Davies, and others with the practical engineering experience of Newman and D. O. Clayden. Blumlein's techniques made an important contribution. The result was the Pilot ACE, one of the first stored-program electronic digital computers in the world, which ran its first program at the NPL on 10 May 1950; it went on to provide the world's first commercial computing service. Newman's key contribution to this achievement ensured him a permanent place among the founders of the computer revolution which was to sweep the world in the following fifty years.<br>
<br>Newman's next task was to lead a group investigating the use of computers in office work. In 1957 the NPL held a course attended by twenty-four representatives of government departments, who then went out into the civil service to spread the new gospel of office automation. One of those who attended, Douglas Wass, later joint head of the home civil service, remembered forty years on how influential the course had proved to be in his career, and particularly commended &#145;the enthusiasm and dynamism of an electronics engineer called Ted Newman&#146;  (Yates, 54&#150;5).<br>
<br>Newman was an irrepressible, perceptive, cheerful man of wide interests and sometimes maverick originality. This combination of innovative ability (he held twenty-six patents) with a strong and friendly personality gained him rapid promotion, and he reached the grade of senior principal scientific officer in 1955 at the age of thirty-seven. This meant that he was responsible for several research projects simultaneously. At different times these included teaching machines, computer reliability, visual pattern recognition, and speech recognition. From 1963 he also helped to manage the advanced computer techniques project, which provided government support for the British computer industry. In all these projects there were others who did much of the detailed work; Newman loved discussion and argument and contributed in his own way, making comments and suggestions which provoked those more directly involved into new lines of thought. He published twenty-five scientific papers on computer engineering, pattern recognition, and related topics. He retired from the NPL in December 1977 and took up a visiting professorship in computer science at Westfield College, London.<br>
<br>Outside work Newman's interests were active and practical. At various times they included running, cycling, building his family home (at Oxshott, Surrey), country dancing, and gardening. His marriage having ended in divorce, in 1982 he went to live with (Kathleen) Margaret Page, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson (<i>b</i>. 1922), a teacher, and the widow of an NPL colleague. He died at their home, 113 New Haw Road, Addlestone, Surrey, from cancer of the stomach, on 7 August 1993, and was cremated at Woking crematorium.<br>
