<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sutton,  Charles  Manners-</span>, first Viscount Canterbury  (1780&#150;1845), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born at Screveton, Nottinghamshire, on 29 January 1780, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17964/', "Charles Manners-Sutton (1755&#150;1828)")</script>, later archbishop of Canterbury, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of Thomas Thoroton of Screveton. He was educated at Eton College (1793&#150;6) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1798&#150;1802), where he took a BA degree as fourth junior optime in 1802 and an MA in 1805. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 19 May 1802, he was called to the bar in May 1806 and practised on the western circuit for several years.<br>
<br>Manners-Sutton's father, a grandson of the third duke of Rutland, who had been the royal choice as primate in 1805, provided him with a post worth over &pound;600 a year, and in the general election of 1806 the Rutland electoral interest secured his return for Scarborough, a constituency he continued to represent until 1832. In London he joined the Alfred Club, then a cradle of rising young tory politicians like Palmerston, Robinson, and Peel. He made his first parliamentary speech in June 1808 on the <span class="roman">Curates Residence Bill</span>. On general issues he supported the Portland and Perceval administrations. His gentlemanly appearance and good voice impressed his contemporaries, and in October 1809 he was invited by Perceval, with royal approval, to take the office of judge-advocate-general.<br>
<br>Over the next eight years Manners-Sutton's interventions in debate were largely confined to his official business, including the periodic defence of flogging in the army against whig-Liberal criticism. He also spoke against parliamentary reform and concessions to Roman Catholics, and in April 1817 introduced a consolidating measure  (57 Geo. III c. 99) on clerical residence and payment of curates. In June 1817 he was the ministerial candidate for the vacant speakership of the House of Commons, defeating his whig opponent, C. W. W. Wynn, by 312 votes to 150. While comparatively young for the office, he was older than two recent speakers, W. W. Grenville and Addington, at the time of their election. The chief criticism of his selection was his lack of knowledge of the forms and procedures of the house. However, he seems to have taken advice from his immediate predecessor, Charles Abbot, and his courteous and obliging manners soon established his authority in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1811 Manners-Sutton married Lucy Maria Charlotte, eldest daughter of John Denison of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, with whom he had two sons, Charles John and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17966/', "John Henry Thomas Manners-Sutton")</script>, and a daughter, Charlotte Matilda. His wife died on 7 December 1815 and he remained a widower until 6 December 1828, when he married Ellen (1791?&#150;1845), widow of John Home-Purves and daughter of Edmund Power of Curragheen, co. Waterford, a hearty, lively Irishwoman (according to Thomas Moore) who contributed further to the popularity of his official entertainments  (Dasent, 306). He retained his strong political views, and in 1827 refused Canning's offer of the Home Office because of their disagreement on the Catholic question. In May 1832, when attempts were being made, following Grey's resignation, to construct a tory reform ministry, he declined to enter a cabinet under Wellington. His resolution wavered, however, when his own name, as one of the rare Conservative politicians uncommitted on the parliamentary reform issue, was put forward for the premiership. At a meeting of senior tories at Apsley House on Sunday 13 May, he treated his future colleagues to an insufferably long and tedious exposition of his views and asked for more time to consider. Next day he wrote to Wellington to accept if no other arrangement seemed possible. His performance at the meeting, however, had disgusted everybody&#151;the coarse and impatient Lyndhurst swore that he would have nothing to do with such &#145;a damned tiresome old bitch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 17 May 1832, 2.298)&#151;and in any case events in the House of Commons that evening put a stop to any further talk of a tory ministry.<br>
<br>In July 1832, at the conclusion of the protracted and exhausting Reform Bill debates, Manners-Sutton expressed his wish to retire from the speaker's chair and was granted a life pension of &pound;4000, with one of &pound;3000 for his heir male. At the ensuing general election he was returned for the University of Cambridge; the whig ministry, unsure of its ability to control the remodelled House of Commons, at the end of December 1832 asked him in flattering terms to continue as speaker. He was accordingly re-elected in January 1833 as governmental candidate with a majority of 210 over E. J. Littleton, who had been put forward by disgruntled radicals. In August 1833, as a special mark of the cabinet's gratitude, he was given the GCB.<br>
<br>During Peel's Hundred Days (1834&#150;5) in office, Manners-Sutton was again embroiled in the formation of a tory administration. After the destruction by fire of the old House of Commons (including his own official residence) in October 1834, he had been in communication with the king over the latter's embarrassing offer of temporary accommodation for the Commons in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. He also attended a few formal privy council meetings subsequent to the change of ministry. This led to partisan charges in the whig press of collusion with William IV in the dismissal in November of Melbourne's government. In the contested election for the speakership in the new parliament in February 1835 he was defeated by 316 votes to 306 by the whig candidate, James Abercromby, in an unprecedented mobilization of party strength, designed to test the stability of the new Conservative administration. He was able, however, to demonstrate that he had not been involved in the king's decision to change his ministers, nor advised a dissolution, nor assisted in the formation of Peel's ministry. In March 1835, on Peel's initiative, he was created Viscount Canterbury, a higher rank than was normally conferred on a retiring speaker. But he seldom spoke in the House of Lords, and after appointment to the high commission for Canadian claims in March 1835 he soon resigned on grounds of his wife's health.<br>
<br>Manners-Sutton was a tall, urbane man with a dignified bearing, though devoid of any great talents. He was short-sighted and, as speaker, occasionally affected, it was alleged, not to be able to recognize the faces or recall the names of whig members  (Dasent, 309). Nevertheless, he earned a reputation for both equanimity and impartiality. The <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> summed up his outward qualities when it wrote in its obituary of his &#145;commanding presence, sonorous voice, and imperturbable temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1845, 291). In handling the inexperienced and boisterous 1833 House of Commons he preferred, in his own metaphor, the snaffle rather than the curb, despite a certain laxity of discipline which resulted  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 5 Sept 1833; cf. Dasent, 305). He established a record as the only speaker to have been elected seven times, though his actual tenure of the chair was exceeded in length by Onslow and Shaw-Lefevre. He became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1817, was given the degree of LLD by Cambridge University in 1824, and held the office of registrar of the court of faculties of the archbishop of Canterbury from 1827 to 1834.<br>
<br>On the night of 18 July 1845, while travelling by train between Slough and Paddington, Manners-Sutton suffered a stroke and died three days later, on 21 July 1845, at his younger son's house in Southwick Crescent, Paddington. His burial took place in the family vault at Addington, Surrey, on 28 July 1845. His wife, with whom he had a daughter, Frances Diana, survived him by only a few months, dying in November 1845. The title passed to his elder son, who died unmarried in 1869, and then to his younger son.<br>
