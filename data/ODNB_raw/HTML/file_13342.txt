<span class="headword">Hind,  John Russell</span>  (1823&#150;1895), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 12 May 1823 in Nottingham, the son of John Hind, a lace manufacturer. He was educated privately, then at Nottingham grammar school, and when aged seventeen was placed as assistant to a civil engineer in London. He had been devoted to astronomy since the age of twelve, and in late 1840 he obtained a junior assistantship in the magnetic division at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. He relieved tedious night duties by calculating orbits, and in his leisure time he used the Sheepshanks equatorial to search for comets. Having been elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) in 1844, he was recommended by the astronomer royal, George Airy, as observer to George Bishop (1785&#150;1861). On 10 July 1846 he married Fanny (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1828), the daughter of Matthew Fuller, a gentleman, at St Pancras Old Church, and in 1849 the first of their six children was born.<br>
<br>Bishop's observatory, built in 1836 at his home, South Villa, Regent's Park, had a Dollond refracting telescope of 7 inches aperture, then a powerful instrument. Aspiring to make the observatory useful, he first employed from 1839 to May 1844 William Rutter Dawes, who measured double stars. When Hind arrived at South Villa in October 1844, the solar system comprised the seven major planets and four minor planets (asteroids) discovered between 1800 and 1807 orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. In December 1845, after a fifteen-year search, Karl Hencke, a German amateur, discovered the fifth asteroid, Astraea. In September 1846 came the sensational discovery of Neptune. Bishop decided to devote his resources to searching for planets. From November 1846 Hind began a systematic search using the newly available Berlin charts. He discovered two comets in 1846 and 1847. In July 1847 Hencke found the sixth asteroid, and by October Hind had discovered the seventh and eighth. These were considered of such interest and importance that John Couch Adams, ignoring thoughts of a medal for Neptune, recommended that Hind and Hencke each have the RAS medal in 1848. Instead, they, Adams, and nine other nominees received testimonials.<br>
<br>The Berlin charts were incomplete. Bishop undertook to produce better charts to fainter limits. The consequent night-time exposure and overwork led to the first breakdowns in Hind's health, in 1848 and 1849. He borrowed &pound;15 from John Lee to fund his recuperation, and a year later lodged his testimonial as security. In September 1850 he discovered his third asteroid, Victoria. Hind's financial stress was relieved in 1851 when he received &pound;100 from the Royal Bounty Fund and in 1852 by the scarce award of a civil-list pension of &pound;200 for important astronomical discoveries.<br>
<br>In 1850 Bishop engaged Norman R. Pogson (trained by Hind) as second assistant, then from 1852 Eduard Vogel, from 1853 to 1855 Albert Marth, and in 1860 George Talmage. In July 1851 Hind travelled to Sweden and successfully observed the total eclipse. In 1852 Hind found four asteroids and in 1854 two more, the last, aptly named Urania, being his tenth. He then gave up regular observing but continued supervision. Great interest in minor planets waned only after 1860, when powerful telescopes indicated they might exist in infinite numbers. After Bishop's death in 1861 his son removed the observatory to Twickenham. Talmage rejoined; Hind moved there and supervised the publication of seventeen of the twenty-four charts before the observatory closed in 1877.<br>
<br>The variety of Hind's discoveries demonstrated the skill and perseverance which underlay his achievements. In 1848 he discovered the second &#145;temporary star&#146; or nova of the nineteenth century, and only the seventh ever recognized in the West; N Oph 2 suddenly appeared in the constellation Ophiuchus at fifth magnitude, then faded to tenth. Comets remained mysterious; when Biela's comet returned in December 1848 Hind reported its pear shape, and ten days later it divided in two. In October 1852 Hind discovered a small nebula adjacent to the star T Tauri; &#145;Hind's nebula&#146; became famous for displaying unmistakable yet inexplicable changes. In 1855 Hind made his first discovery of many variable stars, U Geminorum.<br>
<br>In 1853 the superintendence of the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> office at Gray's Inn became vacant. Against stiff competition the Admiralty chose Hind, who superintended the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> until 1891 and introduced important changes. After making a comparison, in the early 1860s he dropped Buckhardt's lunar tables and adopted those of Hansen, later modified by Newcomb; similarly, Le Verrier's uniform solar and planetary tables were adopted. Hind ensured the <span class="italic">Almanac</span>'s punctuality and accuracy.<br>
<br>Hind was never a theorist. His enduring reputation is as a first-rate practical astronomer. He was an able and tireless computer, calculating for everything he discovered or observed, including one comet so precisely that he observed it at midday when close to the sun. Beyond writing seven popular books and booklets (1841&#150;63), he made a considerable contribution to current practical astronomy by correspondence and more than 130 papers and notices to the international journals of four nations; the astronomer William Plummer said: &#145;few men have made fewer mistakes&#146;  (Plummer, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 202). Hind was foreign secretary of the RAS (1847&#150;57, 1878&#150;80) and served on its council (1846&#150;59, 1864&#150;7). In deference to Airy, who was seeking a fourth term, he withdrew from the presidential nomination for 1864. Popular and respected, he was again proposed by Adams in 1879. When Airy, aged seventy-eight and nearly deaf, intimated he would stand again, Adams with unusual speed procured unanimous nomination of Hind, who was duly elected for 1880&#150;82. Hind was elected FRS in 1863. His many distinctions included in 1851 corresponding membership of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences, associateships of the Russian academy and the Swedish academy, and in 1882 an honorary LLD from Glasgow University. He received the gold medals of the Royal Society (1855), the RAS (1853), and the king of Denmark (1847), and was awarded the Lalande medal three times.<br>
<br>Hind retired in 1891. Of a kindly disposition, he was generous with information, but of a very shy nature. Behind a strong appearance, he suffered repeated attacks of nervous exhaustion throughout his career. His recreation was learning &#145;much curious information&#146; on old comets from ancient records, and recalculating their orbits  (Plummer, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 202). He continued his contributions until a chill precipitated his death from heart disease at his home, 3 Cambridge Park Gardens, Twickenham, on 23 December 1895. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Twickenham.<br>
