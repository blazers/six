<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Porter, Sir  Leslie</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born Leslie Posament on 10 July 1920 at Streatham Manor, Leigham Avenue, Streatham, London, the youngest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of Henry Alfred Posament, later Porter (<i>d</i>. 1955), textile merchant, and his wife, Jennie (<i>d</i>. 1983), daughter of Jacob Goldstein, owner of a chain of tailoring shops. His father had arrived in England from &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, Poland, shortly before the First World War, and his mother came from a Russian Jewish family who had settled in England five generations earlier; she started and founded a clothing design academy. At the time of his birth registration they lived at 4 South Villas, Camden Square, London. He grew up in Camden Town, and was educated at Holloway county secondary school, leaving after matriculating to work in a garage, Sam Morris &amp; Co. He moved to another car dealer, H. R. Owen, in the West End of London, in 1937. As a member of the Territorial Army he was called up at the outbreak of the Second World War, joining the 1st battalion, the Rangers, the King's Royal Rifle Corps, and served in Greece, Cyprus, north Africa, and Italy, ending the war with the rank of technical quartermaster-adjutant. In 1946 he joined his father's household textile business, J. Porter &amp; Co., in Old Street, becoming managing director in 1955, the year of his father's death.<br>
<br>On 26 June 1949, at the New West End Synagogue, Paddington, Porter married Shirley Cohen (<i>b</i>. 1930), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30949/', "Sir John Edward (Jack) Cohen")</script>, founder and chairman of Tesco Stores Ltd; they had one son and one daughter. Although his father-in-law tried to persuade him to join his other son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75879/', "Hyman Kreitman")</script>, at Tesco, Porter resisted for ten years, preferring to build up his own family business, and it was not until 1959, after Jack Cohen's illness, that he agreed to join the Tesco board as a part-time consultant. He became a full-time member of the board in 1960, and assistant managing director in 1964. Porter's experience had been in the marketing of textiles, and when in 1960 Cohen bought Harrow Stores, a drapery and furnishings business, he made Porter joint managing director. At the same time Porter began introducing household goods and furnishings into some Tesco stores, and by 1966 the sale of non-food items had reached nearly 10 per cent of the company's turnover. After the sale of Harrow Stores in 1967 the Tesco board decided to create Tesco Home'n'Wear Ltd to operate and expand the non-foods side of the company, and Porter took charge of that. By 1973 there were sixty-two separate Home'n'Wear stores, and floor space devoted to non-food items in many Tesco supermarkets. In the meantime, following the critical report on the Tesco management by McKinsey &amp; Co. in 1969, there was a boardroom reshuffle, and in 1970 Porter became deputy chairman, Hyman Kreitman was elected chairman, and Cohen was given the title of life president. Porter was briefly managing director in 1972, and when Kreitman resigned in 1973 he became chairman, a position he retained until 1985.<br>
<br>While Jack Cohen was still running Tesco, he quarrelled constantly with his sons-in-law, but while Kreitman, a quiet and unassuming man, was intimidated by this, Porter, self-confident and tough, stood up to his father-in-law, their confrontations including one famous occasion when they were said to have pursued each other round the boardroom brandishing the ornamental Wilkinson swords that hung on the wall. But after 1973 Cohen was forced into the background, while Porter faced the growing crisis threatening Tesco, which in 1974 suffered a &pound;20 million (19.8 per cent) fall in profits. Jack Cohen's policy of &#145;pile it high, sell it cheap&#146; no longer attracted customers, who were moving to rival chains including Sainsburys and Asda. Cohen had failed to see that low prices alone were not enough, that the quality of the product mattered as well, and the Tesco stores appeared old-fashioned and cluttered, selling cheap and shoddy goods, unlike Sainsburys, which had a reputation for quality. At the same time the popularity of trading stamps was waning: a report commissioned by Tesco showed that customers would prefer price cuts to stamps. In 1977, after a bitter struggle on the board, Tesco terminated its agreement with the Green Shield Trading Stamp Company. This was followed by the launch of operation Checkout, with the slogan &#145;Check out at Tesco: prices that help keep the cost of living in check&#146;, the start of a new direction for Tesco, combining a price-cutting campaign made possible by the &pound;20 million a year saved by abandoning trading stamps with a new look for the Tesco stores. At first they could not keep up with demand&#151;in the first year Tesco's share of the grocery market rose from 7 per cent to 12 per cent&#151;but a new centralized buying system replaced the autonomy of individual store managers, while many of the smaller stores were closed, and were replaced by fewer but larger supermarkets. Between 1977 and 1983, 371 stores were closed and 97 new ones opened, and between 1980 and 1985 the average size rose from 11,000 to 17,000 square feet. Tesco stores now had a reputation for offering quality products at affordable prices. One casualty was the Home'n'Wear division: all Home'n'Wear departments and stores were closed in order to concentrate on making Tesco Britain's leading food retailer, an objective that was realized in the 1990s. Although Porter was not responsible for all these changes, under his chairmanship a new management style based on collective responsibility developed, with Porter at the head of a team that he trusted and allowed to get on with the job. &#145;Sir Leslie was not a dictatorial executive chairman&#146;, according to David Malpas, managing director from 1983 to 1997. &#145;His style was more participative in that he &#147;presided over&#148; rather than &#147;implemented&#148; change&#146;  (Porter, 57). Whereas Cohen had been a wholesaler, Porter was a retailer whose aim was to find out what the customer wanted. Cohen concerned himself with short-term profits, while Porter planned for the future, realizing that short-term profit might need to be sacrificed for the sake of longer-term gains: for example, in the late 1970s Tesco invested &pound;100 million in advanced information technology systems.<br>
<br>Porter was knighted in 1983, and in 1985 resigned as chairman. He was appointed president, a title he retained until 1990, but he did not interfere in the running of the company. He had hoped that a member of the Cohen family would join the Tesco board on his departure, but his successor, Ian MacLaurin, the former managing director, opposed the idea of having Porter's wife on the board. Porter later claimed that MacLaurin had promised his son John a seat, a claim MacLaurin denied. Among his public positions Porter was chairman of the Sports Aid Foundation from 1985 to 1988, and international vice-president of the Museum of the Diaspora from 1984.<br>
<br>Porter's wife, Shirley, had been elected to Westminster city council in 1974, becoming leader of the council in 1983; appointed DBE in 1991, she served as lord mayor of Westminster from 1991 to 1992. But in 1994, after the district auditor ruled that she and other members of Westminster city council had been engaged in gerrymandering, involving losses to public funds of some &pound;21 million, and after the death of their grandson in Israel, the Porters settled in the seaside town of Herzliya Pituach, north of Tel Aviv. In 1993 Porter was elected chancellor of Tel Aviv University, where he and his wife founded the Cohen&#150;Porter United Kingdom Building of Life Sciences and the Porter Super Centre for the Environment and Ecological Research, which became the Porter School of Environmental Studies. The Porter Foundation funded the Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics, the Shirley and Leslie Porter School of Cultural Studies, and the Cohen-Porter Family Swimming Pool.<br>
<br>Porter died in Tel Aviv on 20 March 2005, and was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
