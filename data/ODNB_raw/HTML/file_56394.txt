<span class="headword">Kennon,  Sidney</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1754), <span class="occ">midwife and collector</span>, whose family background and education are obscure, distinguished herself initially in her services to the royal family, especially to Queen Caroline and Augusta, princess of Wales. The infant George III was delivered by her. Kennon was highly respected for her professional acumen and, at the time of her death, could command 50 guineas for attending the birth of a child. Her connections at court gave her some degree of influence. Dinner guests at her home in Jermyn Street, London, often included the titled; Frederick, prince of Wales, is said to have dined with her regularly.<br>
<br>As a result of her professional interests and financial success, Mrs Kennon (as she was known) became an avid collector, beginning perhaps in the early 1740s. The earliest records of her holdings refer to natural history material. She owned worms and polyps and traded them with Martin Folkes, president of the Royal Society, with whom she also engaged in discussions regarding their microscopical anatomy. Her collection also contained human anatomical material, a unique claim for a woman collector of her century.<br>
<br>Kennon's collection expanded to include a great variety of subjects. Horace Walpole laughed about the historic and ethnographic items he purchased at her posthumous sale but then displayed them at Strawberry Hill, noting in the catalogue both her ownership and virtuosity. Mary Delany, an avid collector herself, admired Kennon's collection of shells. Richard Mead, physician-in-ordinary to George II, gave her one of a set of three crocodiles which he received about 1745. Her coins and medals were esteemed very fine by both dealers and collectors.<br>
<br>Kennon died at her home, Clifford Street, Burlington Gardens, London, on 11 December 1754. Her belongings were bequeathed to the Revd Dr Arthur Young, author of <span class="italic">Historical Dissertations on Idolatrous Corruptions in Religion</span> (1734) and father of Arthur Young (1741&#150;1820), the agricultural writer. He sold the natural history books to a relative, while the coins, natural history specimens, and historic and ethnographic curiosities were sold at public sales through the auctioneer Abraham Langford in 1755 and 1756. The sales were frequented by many collectors. The shells alone were valued by one observer at &pound;2500, while another estimated the whole of the estate to be worth about &pound;5000. &#145;It is said that on her deathbed Kennon gave the physician Frank Nicholls a bank note for &pound;500 for his services to the midwives' cause &#146;  (Donnison, 32).<br>
<br>Kennon was an acknowledged expert on childbirth and an opponent of man-midwives and their use of instruments. Despite this apparent acknowledgement of distinct gender roles, Mrs Kennon in both her profession and collections successfully negotiated a territory between such separate spheres.<br>
