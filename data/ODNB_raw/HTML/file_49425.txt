<span class="headword">&AElig;lberht</span>  (<em>d.</em> 779/80), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the teacher of Alcuin, whose <span class="italic">Versus de patribus regibus et sanctis Euboricensis ecclesiae</span> (&#145;Verses on the Fathers, Kings and Saints of the Church of York&#146;) constitute the principal source for his career  (Alcuin, ll. 1397&#150;1596). Some details are recorded in the early northern annals preserved in the <span class="italic">Historia regum</span> and the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>: the dates of his archiepiscopate; that he received the pallium from Pope Hadrian in 773; that he died at &#145;Ceastre&#146; (possibly Chester-le-Street, co. Durham); and that Eanbald (I) had been elected as his successor before his death&#151;Alcuin gives information placing the date as July 778, although 777 is also possible, and explains that Eanbald functioned as his &#145;associate bishop&#146;  (Alcuin, ll. 1565, 1518). He may also have corresponded with Lul, archbishop of Mainz, if (as seems probable) he is the latter's English correspondent who appears in two letters under the name Coena, presumed to be a nickname. This person is described as &#145;adorned with the insignia of the highest pontificate&#146; so was evidently an archbishop, and, since Lul was asking for works of Bede, almost certainly an archbishop of York  (Tangl, nos. 124&#150;5).<br>
<br>Alcuin provides further details of &AElig;lberht's career. A relative and boon companion of Archbishop Ecgberht, himself the brother of King Eadberht of the Northumbrians, he was placed in a monastery in childhood by his family  (Alcuin, ll. 1415&#150;29); he was apparently educated at the school of York Minster. Alcuin's account of his work as archbishop is panegyrical in style, a trait given further emphasis because Alcuin seems to have regarded &AElig;lberht as a model for later archbishops; but it is clear, nevertheless, that he had a major impact on the development of the church of York in three respects. First, he was responsible for assembling the library, travelling abroad, including to Rome, to collect books for it. By Alcuin's account, it contained a wide range of Latin writers and also Greek writers in Latin translation, and it was certainly of major importance, as is apparent in Alcuin's own training, and in demands for its books made by the continental missionaries Boniface and Lul. Second, &AElig;lberht was a teacher of the so-called seven liberal arts, not only the <i>trivium</i> (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic), but also the <i>quadrivium</i> (music, astronomy, geometry, and arithmetic), which led to studies of Holy Scripture; and he also taught compute (the study of fixing the festivals of the church) and natural history. Third, &AElig;lberht was a patron of art and architecture at York. According to Alcuin, he endowed the church of St Peter (York Minster) with two altars. The first was dedicated to St Paul and stood on the site of the baptism of the first Christian king of Northumbria, Eadwine. That it was very costly is indicated by Alcuin's describing it as &#145;covered with gold, silver, and jewels&#146;, lit by a chandelier which &#145;held three great vessels, each of nine tiers&#146;, and having on it a cross covered &#145;entirely with precious metals&#146;, the whole weighing &#145;many pounds in pure silver&#146;. The second altar, dedicated to the martyrs and Holy Cross, was apparently just as rich, and had on it a cruet &#145;made in pure gold and of great weight&#146;  (Alcuin, ll. 1490&#150;1520). &AElig;lberht's archiepiscopate also saw the construction and consecration in York of the church of the Beneficent Wisdom (Alma Sophia), which was built under his orders by Eanbald (the future Archbishop Eanbald (I)) and Alcuin. This church is now lost, but, to judge from Alcuin's description, it was an imposing structure comprising many chapels and thirty altars. The dedication is an unusual one and may suggest the influence on &AElig;lberht of churches of the Holy Wisdom at Constantinople or Benevento. He was clearly an ambitious prelate, and the choice for his consecration in 767 of 24 April, the feast day of that most ambitious of York ecclesiastics, Wilfrid, may have been a deliberate one in the context of &AElig;lberht's aspirations. A reference in one of Alcuin's letters to how the predecessors of Archbishop Eanbald (II) faced hostility from kings and princes  (D&uuml;mmler, no. 232) probably encompasses &AElig;lberht. If so, the reasons for this hostility are not known, although Alcuin's observation elsewhere that he &#145;in justice &hellip; did not spare evil kings and nobles&#146;  (Alcuin, l. 1479) suggests that it may have been condemnation of royal morals which led to the archbishop's difficulties. His archiepiscopate coincided in any case with a turbulent period of Northumbrian history, encompassing the expulsion of King Alhred in 774 and possibly also that of King &AElig;thelred in 779. &AElig;lberht died on 8 November, in either 779 or 780.<br>
