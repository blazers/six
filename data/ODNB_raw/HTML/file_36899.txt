<span class="headword">Wilkins,  Augustus Samuel</span>  (1843&#150;1905), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in Enfield Road, Kingsland, Middlesex, on 20 August 1843, the son of Samuel J. Wilkins, a schoolmaster in Brixton, and his wife, Mary Haslam of Thaxted, Essex. His parents were Congregationalists. After being educated at Bishop's Stortford collegiate school, Wilkins attended the lectures of Henry Malden, professor of Greek, and of F. W. Newman, professor of Latin, at University College, London. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, with an open exhibition in October 1864, becoming a foundation scholar in 1866, and winning college prizes for English essays in 1865 and 1866, and the moral philosophy prizes in 1868. He distinguished himself as a fluent speaker at the union, and was president for Lent term 1868. In the same year he graduated BA as fifth in the first class of the classical tripos. Both as an undergraduate and as a bachelor of arts he won the members' prize for the Latin essay, while his skill as a writer of English was attested by the three university prizes he won&#151;the Hulsean for 1868, the Burney for 1870, and the Hare for 1873&#151;for essays respectively entitled &#145;Christian and pagan ethics&#146;, &#145;Phoenicia and Israel&#146;, and &#145;National education in Greece&#146;.<br>
<br>As a nonconformist, Wilkins was legally disqualified for a fellowship. Although the religious disability was cancelled by the <span class="roman">Tests Act</span> of 1871, Wilkins remained disqualified by his marriage in 1870 to Charlotte Elizabeth, the second daughter of W. Field of Bishop's Stortford. Moreover, he could not benefit from the removal of this second disability under the statutes of 1882, since these precluded from eligibility anyone who had taken his first degree more than ten years before, as he had.<br>
<br>In 1868 Wilkins took the MA degree in the University of London, receiving the gold medal for classics, and in the same year was appointed Latin lecturer at Owens College, Manchester, where he was promoted in the following year to the Latin professorship. For eight years he also lectured on comparative philology, and for many more he undertook the classes in <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> criticism. In the University of London he was examiner in classics from 1884 to 1886, and in Latin from 1887 to 1890 and from 1894 to 1899. He was highly successful as a popular lecturer on literary subjects in Manchester and in other large towns of Lancashire. He was of much service to education in Manchester outside Owens College, particularly as chairman of the Lancashire Independent college, and of the council of the High School for Girls. Within Owens College he was a strong supporter of the claims of women to equal educational rights with men, and of the establishment of a theological department in the university. In 1903, after thirty-four years' tenure of the Latin professorship in Manchester, a weakness of the heart compelled him to resign, but he was appointed to the new and lighter office of professor of classical literature. He died on 26 July 1905 at the seaside village of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, in north Wales, and was buried in the cemetery of Colwyn Bay.<br>
<br>Wilkins was one of the first classical scholars to introduce to English readers the results of German investigations in scholarship, philology, and ancient history. His chief independent work was his excellent edition of Cicero's <span class="italic">De oratore</span> (bks i&#150;iii, 1879&#150;92) which continued to be regularly consulted a century later. A much appreciated critical edition of the text of the whole of Cicero's rhetorical works followed in 1903. He also issued commentaries on Cicero's <span class="italic">Speeches Against Catiline</span> (1871), and the speech <span class="italic">De imperio Gn&aelig;i Pompeii</span> (1879), and on Horace's <span class="italic">Epistles</span> (1885); he contributed to Postgate's <span class="italic">Corpus po&euml;tarum Latinorum</span> a critical text of the <span class="italic">Thebais</span> and <span class="italic">Achilleis</span> of Statius (1904); and he produced <span class="italic">Roman Antiquities</span> (1877) and <span class="italic">Roman Literature</span> (1890), as well as a book on Roman education (1905). He contributed important articles to various works of reference, including the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He joined H. J. Roby in preparing an elementary Latin grammar in 1893.<br>
<br>Wilkins dedicated his edition of the <span class="italic">De oratore</span> to the University of St Andrews, which conferred on him an honorary degree in 1882; he received the same distinction at Dublin in 1892, and took the degree of LittD at Cambridge in 1885.<br>
