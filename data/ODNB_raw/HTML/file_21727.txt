<span class="headword">Peart,  Edward</span>  (1755/6&#150;1824), <span class="occ">physician and writer on science and medicine</span>, was an MD and a corresponding member of the London Medical Society. He practised for some time at Knightsbridge, but afterwards removed to Butterwick, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, where he wrote on numerous scientific topics. He was chiefly known for his works on physical and chemical theory, which involved him in polemics with the critical magazines. Although an acute critic of Lavoisier's chemical theories, he failed to grasp their theoretical scope or their experimental foundations, and hence his criticisms, though ingenious, ultimately proved unsound.<br>
<br>In his first work, <span class="italic">The Generation of Animal Heat</span> (1788), Peart explained all chemical and physical phenomena by assuming the existence of four elements&#151;aether, phlogiston, the acid principle, and earth. In the following year these were reduced to three, two active principles, aether and phlogiston, and one fixed. As he explained in his next book, <span class="italic">On the Elementary Principles of Nature</span> (1789), when a fixed particle is surrounded by an atmosphere of particles of aether radiating from it in straight lines, it forms an earthy (alkaline) particle; a phlogiston atmosphere produces an acid particle. All actions &#145;at a distance&#146;, corresponding to the phenomena of electricity, magnetism, and gravitation, were explained by means of these &#145;atmospheres&#146; in Peart's subsequent works, <span class="italic">On Electricity</span> (1791), <span class="italic">On the Properties of Matter</span> (1792), and <span class="italic">On Electric Atmospheres &hellip; [with] a Letter to Mr. Read of Knightsbridge</span> (1793). He used the same principles to criticize the theory of Lavoisier in <span class="italic">The antiphlogistic doctrine of M. Lavoisier critically examined &hellip; [with] strictures on Dr. Priestley's experiments</span> (1795) and <span class="italic">On the Composition and Properties of Water</span> (1796). Peart was also identified as the publisher of the anonymously authored anti-Lavoisian satire, <span class="italic">The Sceptic</span> (1800).<br>
<br>The least speculative of Peart's books were those on physiology and medicine, to which he turned later in his career: <span class="italic">Physiology</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Practical Information on Malignant Scarlet Fever</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Practical Information on St Anthony's Fire</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Practical Information on Rheumatism</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Practical Information on Inflammation of the Bowels</span> (1802), and <span class="italic">On the Consumption of the Lungs</span> (1803). In <span class="italic">Animal Heat</span> he had revived the idea of John Mayow that animal combustion takes place in the substance of the muscle and not in the lung, as Lavoisier thought. In the same book he saw clearly that the constant temperature of animals in exercise and at rest must be due to a correlation of various functions, and investigated the matter experimentally in a somewhat rough way. He expressed the view that &#145;excitability of the muscular fibres is the great characteristic of life in animals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Animal Heat</span>, 91). In his medical works he showed himself untrammelled by the prevailing doctrines of his day, using simple drugs, and ascribing their beneficial effects to direct action on the diseased matter. Peart declared  (<span class="italic">On the Composition of Water</span>, 67), &#145;I write for amusement at my leisure hours&#146;, and, in the preface to <span class="italic">Physiology</span>  (1798, xiii), &#145;I have no expectation of making converts to my peculiar views&#146;. He seems to have made none. From his writings, and in spite of his controversies, Peart appears as a man of kindly though erratic tendencies. In <span class="italic">Physiology</span> and elsewhere he vigorously protested against the unnecessary vivisections of his time.<br>
<br>Peart died at Butterwick in 1824, probably in November.<br>
