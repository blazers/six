<span class="headword">Kettell,  Ralph</span>  (1563&#150;1643), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was probably born between 4 April and 16 June 1563, the third son of John Kettell, gentleman, of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Jane. On 3 April 1579, shortly before his sixteenth birthday, he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, presumably at the instigation of Elizabeth, Lady Paulet, widow of the college's founder, Sir Thomas Pope, who lived nearby at Tittenhanger and who nominated him to a scholarship four months later. He graduated BA on 7 July 1582 and was elected to a fellowship the following year. He proceeded MA on 23 April 1586, BTh on 11 June 1594, and DTh on 9 May 1597. Trinity was to be Kettell's home for the whole of his adult life. The family link with the college was strengthened by the subsequent admission of his younger brothers Christopher and George. The young college was by no means secure in its finances or religion, but Ralph Yeldard, then president, was a competent administrator and a good example. Kettell played a full part in college life, and when Yeldard died in 1599 he was a natural successor. He was thirty-six, with a commanding physical presence and a gift for quick-fire repartee.<br>
<br>From the beginning Kettell identified closely with his college and relished the minutiae of institutional life, while never losing sight of the bigger picture. A sound steward with a taste for litigation, he created an extensive archive of many of his activities expressly for the benefit of posterity. His writing was firm and compressed, his ink home-made. His greatest undertaking, the building of a new hall in 1620, was necessitated by the collapse of the original medieval structure, which had been undermined by his previous project, the digging of cellars below. It is tempting to see a direct link to his strategy for controlling drunkenness&#151;brewing good beer in house. But perhaps of even greater importance was his inculcation of an atmosphere of college loyalty, which surely helped Trinity weather the years of the political and religious turbulence that followed his death. In 1602 he drew up, and added to the statutes, a levy on all inherited capital or income from every member of the foundation, which he followed by instituting a very profitable plate fund. Before 1620 he had given his name to a substantial house on Broad Street, which he had built as a private investment.<br>
<br>As president Kettell assumed from 23 January 1604 the rectorship of the college living of Garsington, Oxfordshire, and took his parochial duties equally seriously. He married soon after his election, but little evidence remains of his private life. In 1606 his infant daughter was buried two days after her baptism. In 1624 a wife, perhaps his second, was also buried at Garsington. His wide-ranging personal opinions, however, were noted by all who encountered him, and towards the end of his life his assiduity in such matters as supervising college lectures and his eccentricities, which included spying on the evening activities of undergraduates in their rooms, led to his becoming a figure of fun. John Aubrey, admitted to Trinity in 1642, is the source of many uncorroborated observations, which may be taken with a pinch of salt. But Aubrey saw the wisdom behind the &#145;sharp gray eies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 175) and knew that Kettell's &#145;Hasty-pudding&#146; brain  (ibid., 177) should never be underestimated. He noted that in his religion Kettell was &#145;a right Church of England man&#146;  (ibid., 176), disliking extremes, avoiding factions, and actively doing good in secret.<br>
<br>It was Aubrey's opinion that Kettell would have reached his century had not the civil war arrived in Oxford. He used his age to avoid taking the unpalatable protestation oath in 1642 and defied both the soldiers and the court ladies who subsequently invaded the scholarly seclusion of Trinity. Kettell died at his college in July 1643, possibly of typhus, which was prevalent in civil war Oxford, and was buried on 5 August in the chancel at Garsington. One of the fellows painted his picture, from memory, on a small board, which became part of the college's picture collection.<br>
