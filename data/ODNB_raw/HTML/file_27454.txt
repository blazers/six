<span class="headword">Tilson,  Henry</span>  (1659&#150;1695), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born into a respectable Lancashire family, the son of Nathaniel Tilson, and grandson of Henry Tilson (1576&#150;1655), the bishop of Elphin, formerly chaplain to the earl of Strafford in Ireland. He entered the studio of Sir Peter Lely with whom he also resided, and worked as his pupil and assistant until the master's death in 1680. Vertue records that before he went to Italy, Tilson painted a group portrait of his own family &#145;representing His Father setting leaning on his hand. his mother with her younger son [Christopher] by her. his sister standing behind &amp; himself with his pallet in his hand. &hellip; in a masterly manner well disposed, firmly drawn &amp; freely pencild&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.68). In 1685 he travelled to Rome via Paris and Venice in the company of his friend the Swedish painter Michael Dahl, who painted his portrait, and made a name for himself there by doing crayon copies of the old masters. Tilson also painted a self-portrait, &#145;a head with a pencil in his hand. leaning on a bust very well behind it written &#147;H. Tilsona Roma. 1687&#148;&#146;  (ibid.). Both this and the family portrait were formerly in the possession of Tilson's descendant Henry Tilson Shaen Carter of Watlington House, Oxfordshire, and were exhibited at the National Portrait Exhibition, South Kensington Museum, in 1867. He had returned to England by 1689, and appears to have earned enough respect as a portraitist to build up a sound practice, painting in a style somewhere between Kneller, Riley, and Dahl. He was considered one of the most able of the lesser native portrait painters of his time. Despite this growing reputation, however, Tilson suffered from both unrequited love for his patroness, a Mrs Green, and depression, and &#145;retir'd into his Closett. &amp; with a pistol shot [himself] thro' the heart. aged about 36&#146;  (ibid., 1.68). He was buried on 25 November 1695 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. Examples of his work are in the Guildhall, London; National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh; and Belton House, Lincolnshire, and Dyrham Park, Hertfordshire.<br>
