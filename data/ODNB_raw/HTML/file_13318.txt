<span class="headword">Hillary,  William</span>  (1697&#150;1763), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Birkrigg, an isolated farmhouse near Hawes in Upper Wensleydale, Yorkshire, on 17 March 1697. He was the second son of John Hillary and his wife, Mary Robinson, Quakers who belonged to an influential group of Friends in Wensleydale that included the Robinson, Fothergill, and Hillary families. The Hillarys moved in 1699 to a substantial farmhouse in the nearby village of Burtersett which to this day is known as Hillary Hall. Nothing is known of Hillary's schooling but in 1715 he was apprenticed to a Quaker apothecary in Bradford, Benjamin Bartlett. After seven years he went to the University of Leiden, where he was a student of Hermann Boerhaave, and where he graduated MD in 1722 with a thesis entitled <span class="italic">Dissertatio medicas inauguralis practica de febribus intermittentibus</span>. Hillary then settled as a physician in Ripon where he stayed until 1734. During this time he recorded the changes in the weather and the epidemics he encountered in an attempt to correlate weather and disease. His observations were published in the second edition of his <span class="italic">A Practical Essay on the Smallpox</span> (1740). He had by then moved to Bath where he practised from 1734 until 1746.<br>
<br>At Bath, Hillary's attention was drawn in 1737 to a spring in Lyncombe, to the south of Bath, which he was to dignify with the name of a spa. His <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Contents and Medicinal Virtues of Lincomb Spa Water Near Bath</span> (1742) extolled the manifold virtues of the spa water, which had been taken by, among many others, the fourth earl of Chesterfield, to whom Hillary dedicated his book. By 1746, however, his position in Bath had become, for obscure reasons, unsatisfactory. Then, through the good offices of John Fothergill, a family friend, also formerly apprenticed to Benjamin Bartlett, Hillary moved to the island of Barbados, arriving there in early 1747. He sought to continue the work on weather and disease that he had begun in Ripon but an unfortunate accident to his barometer prevented him from starting his observations until 1752. In 1751 he had an important consultation. Lawrence Washington, in the company of his brother George, and in search of relief from the mortal tuberculosis from which he suffered, sought Hillary's opinion on his disorder. The event was recorded by George Washington in his diary.<br>
<br>On All Saints' day 1755 Hillary witnessed the remarkable ebbing and flowing of the tide in Barbados which suggested to him that there must have been a cataclysmic earthquake far out at sea. Only two months later did he hear of the Lisbon earthquake which had occurred that same day. From a knowledge of the time difference Hillary was able to calculate that the shock wave had travelled across the Atlantic at over 400 miles an hour, a remarkable speed, he commented, for anything to be transmitted through water. His work in Barbados was recorded after he returned to England in his <span class="italic">Observations on the changes of the air, and the concomitant epidemical diseases in the island of Barbados, to which is added a treatise on the putrid bilious fever, commonly called the yellow fever; and such other diseases as are indigenous or endemial, in the West India islands or in the torrid zone</span> (1759). This was one of the first books in English to deal specifically with tropical disease. It contains an early description of the disorder known as tropical sprue, a form of intestinal malabsorption causing nutritional deficiency that occurs particularly in islands such as Puerto Rico and in countries of the Far East. Hillary did not confine his comments to medical matters. He was forthright in condemning local sartorial fashions. For the hot climate of the West Indies he advised a &#145;loose gown or Banjan&#146;, the dress of the mandarins, immensely more comfortable than &#145;a thick rich Coat and Waistcoat, daubed and loaded with Gold&#146;, under which he had seen men melting, &#145;preferring the Character of a Fop&#146; to that of a &#145;Man of Sense and Honour&#146;.<br>
<br>Hillary returned to London in 1759 after seeming to have had a financially successful stay in Barbados. A contemporary stated that Hillary had made &pound;6000 during his twelve years in the island. He lived at first in East Street, off Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury. After seeing his <span class="italic">Observations</span> through the press he was occupied with other literary ventures, first <span class="italic">The Nature, Properties, and Laws of Motion of Fire</span> (1760). He then embarked on one of his most ambitious and idealistic ventures, <span class="italic">An inquiry into the means of improving medical knowledge, by examining all those methods which have hindered, or increased its improvement in all past ages</span> (1761). It was in fact an eighteenth-century history of medicine.<br>
<br>Hillary died, a lifelong bachelor, on 25 April 1763. He was described in the records of the Friends as of &#145;St Dunstan in the West&#146; and had been a member of Peel Meeting, which met at St John Street, Clerkenwell. He was buried on 1 May in the Quaker burial-ground at Bunhill Fields. The cause of his death was said to be &#145;fever&#146;. He left no will but an administration was granted to his younger brother, Richard, merchant of Liverpool. Richard Hillary's second son, named for his doctor uncle, was Sir William Hillary, founder in 1824 of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.<br>
