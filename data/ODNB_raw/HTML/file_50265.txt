<span class="headword">Cheyne, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1390&#150;1468), <span class="occ">Lollard and rebel</span>, was the elder son of Roger Cheyne (1362&#150;1414) of Drayton Beauchamp, Buckinghamshire, one of the leaders of the Lollard movement in the early fifteenth century. Roger may well have adopted his heretical leanings through the influence of the prominent Lollard knight and diplomat Sir John Cheyne (<i>d</i>. 1414) of Beckford, Gloucestershire, to whom he was related, and as an MP in the Coventry parliament of October 1404 he doubtless supported Sir John's proposals for the appropriation of the temporalities of the church. With Roger Cheyne's support and protection a priest called Thomas Drayton preached Lollard doctrines in the region near his home, and when Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417) escaped from the Tower of London and raised his fellow Lollards in rebellion against Henry V early in 1414, Roger, with his sons John and Thomas, joined him with a contingent from Buckinghamshire. Following their defeat at St Giles's Fields, nine of the Cheynes' followers were executed on 12 January, but John and his father were captured and handed over to the constable of the Tower six days later. Roger died in the Tower on 14 May, and John remained a prisoner until 2 November, when the king generously pardoned his treasons, felonies, and insurrections, and, within a week, allowed him to take possession of his paternal inheritance. This included, besides Drayton Beauchamp, the manors of Grove in Chesham in the same county, Cassington in Oxfordshire, and Rolleston in Leicestershire, as well as land in Hertfordshire and property in London, which together provided an annual income of at least &pound;50.<br>
<br>According to his epitaph, John Cheyne, a man of exceptional strength and animated by ardent faith, then travelled to the Holy Land, where he endured great hardships among the Saracens and slew a giant. By the time of his next appearance in the records, in 1420, he had been knighted. Following his return to England, Cheyne established useful political contacts with Henry Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1447), bishop of Winchester, and Sir Edward Stradling, the husband of Beaufort's bastard daughter. Towards the end of 1421 he was elected MP for Buckinghamshire on the first of seven occasions, and in the years 1422&#150;6 he served successively as JP, sheriff, and escheator, all in his home county. During the parliament of 1425 (one of those he attended) he may well have promoted two petitions of a distinctly Lollard flavour: one complaining about absentee clergy and the holding of livings in plurality, and the other drawing attention to the plight of suspect heretics who had been kept in prison for long periods without trial (a matter that had touched him personally). The speaker of that parliament, Sir Thomas Waweton, subsequently, in 1429, made a false return as sheriff of Buckinghamshire in Cheyne's favour, overriding an election already held. A public outcry resulted in the appointment of a commission of inquiry on 24 September, two days after the opening of the parliament, but it was not until the justices of assize conducted hearings in the following March (after parliament had been dissolved) that Cheyne was declared illegally returned, and Waweton was censured and fined heavily.<br>
<br>Four months later, in July 1430, a commission of oyer and terminer was set up to investigate widespread complaints of oppressions, extortions, assaults, and injuries committed by the two Cheyne brothers and their henchmen in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, allegations that included torture, beatings, and theft. In September the Cheynes were indicted for robbery, embracery, and perverting the course of justice. These alleged crimes all took place in and near the manor of &#145;Maudeleyns&#146; in Northchurch, which bordered the Cheynes' property at Chesham, and point to a major dispute over title to the manor. Even so, the brothers were acquitted in the king's bench. This was not the end of their troubles, however, for in June 1431, a few weeks after &#145;Jack Sharp's&#146; abortive Lollard rising in Berkshire, the Buckinghamshire authorities were ordered to arrest Sir John Cheyne, to seize his manors of Drayton and Grove, confiscate all books, rolls, schedules, bills, and any suspicious memoranda found there, and to certify the contents of his armoury and library to the king's council. Cheyne's brother was arrested at the same time, and both men were imprisoned in the Tower until the following 4 August, when they were allowed to go free. It seems that their complicity in the rising had not been proved. Cheyne had been omitted from all royal commissions since 1426, an indication that he was not trusted in official circles. Nevertheless, he was elected to the very next parliament summoned after his release from the Tower, in 1432, albeit apparently only after another contested election.<br>
<br>Property dealings took up some of Cheyne's time in the 1440s, when he took advantage of the financial difficulties of his presumed kinsman, John Cheyne of Chenies, whose estates he now purchased. These increased his income by some &pound;60 p.a. Although Sir John sat in the Commons again in 1445, it was not until the 1450s that he was considered acceptable once more for a role in local government; he secured appointment to the Hertfordshire bench in 1455 after an absence from such service of more than thirty years. Little is known about his political affiliations during the civil war years, and he is recorded in association with only one magnate: the irresponsible and untrustworthy Henry Holland, duke of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1475), a claimant to the protectorship during Henry VI's illness. Cheyne lived to an advanced age&#151;if not to the century ascribed to him by antiquarians. Aged about seventy-eight, he died on 15 August 1468 and was buried in the chancel of Drayton Beauchamp church. He left no surviving issue either from his first marriage, to Joan, said to be a daughter of Sir Robert Fitzmarmaduke, or from his second, to Agnes, daughter of William Lexham. By settlements agreed in 1466 the latter had secured as her jointure the valuable manors of Chenies and Cogenhoe. The heir to these, and to Cheyne's own patrimony, was his three-year-old great-great-nephew, John. Sir John's widow married Edmund Molyneux (<i>d</i>. 1485) and died in 1494. Whether he had remained a Lollard to the very end is impossible to say, especially as his will has not survived. However, one of his bequests, an annuity of 50<i>s</i>. to the house of Dominican friars at Kings Langley, seems orthodox enough.<br>
