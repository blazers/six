<span class="headword">Croudace,  Camilla Mary Julia</span>  (1844&#150;1926), <span class="occ">supporter of education for women</span>, was born on 29 January 1844 at Marsh House, Homerton, Middlesex, the daughter of Thomas Croudace and his wife, Anne Hester Vignoles. She spent part of her early life in Kiev with her mother, her older brother, and her grandfather, the civil engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28282/', "Charles Vignoles")</script>, who was responsible for building a suspension bridge over the Dnieper River. Here she laid the foundations for her love of languages by learning French, German, and Russian. After returning to England, she attended a small school in Notting Hill Gate, in London, before entering the preparatory class of Queen's College, Harley Street, in 1856, where Dorothea Beale was one of her teachers. A year later she entered the college itself, which was to prove the centre of her life's work, and attended lectures given by F. D. Maurice, R. C. Trench, and E. H. Plumptre and others; Maurice particularly impressed her deeply, and she retained a vivid memory of his teaching to the end of her life.<br>
<br>On leaving the college in 1861 Camilla Croudace spent seven years as a governess to several families. After a further four years of extensive travels on the continent, she and her mother settled in Hampstead, and she secured a teaching post at Kensington high school, the first of the schools of the new Girls' Public Day School Company (later Trust). But it was not long before she was invited to return to Queen's as &#145;lady resident&#146; in succession to Eleanor Grove. From 1881 until her retirement in 1906 she served under five principals. Most of the teaching was done by the male professors; her responsibilities were for discipline and for the communal life of the students, though in addition she always took a deep interest in the students' intellectual progress and encouraged them to continue with further study. She led prayers in the morning, presided over lunch, and arranged social events after the hours of teaching.<br>
<br>Camilla Croudace was much loved and respected by all who came under her care; they remembered her regal bearing (she always wore a lace cap), her generosity, her patience, and her sense of humour. She provided stability, a gracious atmosphere, and intellectual encouragement for generations of students, one of the most brilliant of whom was Gertrude Bell. Her very wide circle of friends from many walks of life were frequently entertained at the college, and students would often be invited to act as hostesses. At weekends she would sometimes invite girls to visit her country home in Surrey, and in the holidays she organized walking parties. It was due to her initiative that four Greek plays were presented at the college during her period of office. She was devoted to Queen's, to its tradition of liberal education, and to its founder, and it was due to her initiative that a fund was started to purchase the portrait of Maurice which was hung in the college library. At her retirement, representatives of every college generation since 1881 gathered to present her with the means to purchase an annuity. Her wide cultural and intellectual interests included a particular attraction to the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg.<br>
<br>Camilla Croudace divided her retirement between homes in West Liss, Hampshire, and Haslemere, Surrey. She took a few private pupils for a time, and kept closely in touch with the Old Queen's Society. She died at Keith Cottage, Park Avenue, Worthing, of senile decay on 3 April 1926, aged eighty-two.<br>
