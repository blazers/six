<span class="headword">Baxter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Young]</span>,  (Mary) Kathleen</span>  (1901&#150;1988), <span class="occ">advocate of women's rights</span>, was born on 30 May 1901 to a Roman Catholic family in Bradford, Yorkshire, the eighth child in the family of three daughters and five sons (one of whom died in infancy) of Richard Aloysius Young, woollen manufacturer, and his wife, (Mary) Ann Barker. Her father died during her infancy. She was educated at St Joseph's College, Bradford, and won an open scholarship to the Society of Oxford Home Students (later St Anne's College), Oxford, where she obtained a third class in modern history in 1922 and a second in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1923.<br>
<br>Kathleen Young entered the Inland Revenue and was inspector of taxes in Bradford and Leeds until her marriage in Westminster Cathedral, London, on 12 September 1931 to Herbert James (H. J.) Baxter, a barrister who later became a county court judge. He was the son of James Baxter, whose career was in the army and civil service. There were two daughters of the marriage, and a son, who became a Roman Catholic priest. When she married she was obliged by the <span class="roman">Income Tax Act</span> to resign from the Inland Revenue. She became a tax consultant to a London firm of chartered accountants. During the Second World War she worked in the Ministry of Supply at the wool control in Ilkley, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>After the war the family moved from London to a house in Bessel's Green, Kent, which remained their home for forty years. Kathleen Baxter used her intellectual and analytical abilities to further causes she believed in. In her career she had experienced discrimination against women. She worked for equal rights, better education, and better job opportunities for women, to enable them to take their place in decision making and become an effective voice for the improvement of society.<br>
<br>In 1951 Kathleen Baxter joined the National Council of Women, founded in 1895, a non-party-political organization affiliated to the International Council of Women. She held high office on many of the council's specialist committees. In the 1950s she led a campaign, with their education committee, which achieved improvement in the university grants system. She also founded the council's science and technology committee, which pressed for better education in science and mathematics for girls, and inaugurated a status-of-women committee, which submitted important points for incorporation into the <span class="roman">Sex Equality Act</span> of 1975. She was elected vice-president (1961&#150;4), and subsequently, as president (1964&#150;6), she was involved with national and international issues. In 1966, as vice-chair of the European Centre of the International Council of Women, she led the British women's delegation to the international conference in Tehran, at which Britain's resolution on slavery was passed unanimously. She served on the United Kingdom human rights year national executive in 1968. As a governor of the British Institute of Human Rights she was asked by the United Nations' secretary-general to write a background paper on the advancement of women's rights for the 1968 international conference on human rights, and she gave evidence to the UN session on human rights in Geneva. At the time of Britain's application for membership of the European Economic Community, she successfully pressed the government to consult the major women's organizations and was largely responsible for the establishment of the Women's Consultative Council (renamed in 1969 the Women's National Commission): its first co-chairs were herself and a government minister. In late middle age she studied law, from both interest in her husband's profession and knowledge that it would further her own work; she was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1971 but ceased taking cases when her husband became gravely ill in 1974. After his death in that year, she was appointed honorary legal adviser to the National Council of Women, while still continuing to serve on the executive of the Women's National Commission. In her dual capacity she chaired working parties commenting on documents from the Law Commission and the Criminal Law Revision Committee relating to women, children, and the family.<br>
<br>In 1978 Kathleen Baxter was awarded the papal cross <i>pro ecclesia et pontifice</i> for outstanding service to the church. She was president of the National Board of Catholic Women (1974&#150;7), a founder member of the Catholic bishops' conference legislation committee, and a member of their bioethical advisory committee on artificial insemination, <i>in vitro</i> fertilization, and genetic engineering, helping to foster a broad social concern in these Catholic circles. In Kent she served on the hospital, maternity wing, and old people's home committees, and as a governor of four schools. She was devoted to her family and four grandsons, and greatly enjoyed music and tennis.<br>
<br>Kathleen Baxter combined high intelligence with an affectionate nature. She was a good-looking woman with an appearance of natural dignity and authority; silver hair framed a broad forehead, beneath which strikingly blue eyes claimed attention, and a smile of warmth and charm promised interest and encouragement. She died on 25 October 1988 in hospital in Bromley, Kent.<br>
