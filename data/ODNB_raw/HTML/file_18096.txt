<span class="headword">Marryat <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Church, Lean]</span>,  Florence</span>  (1833&#150;1899), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Brighton, Sussex, on 9 July 1833 (and was baptized at St Nicholas's Church, Brighton, on 21 August 1833), the youngest of eleven children of the novelist and naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18097/', "Captain Frederick Marryat (1792&#150;1848)")</script> and his wife, Catherine (1791?&#150;1883), daughter of Sir Stephen Shairp of Houston, Linlithgowshire. She was educated at home and developed a love of reading, which she always maintained. Although her parents legally separated when she was an infant and her childhood was divided between them, she remained particularly devoted to her father and to his memory, reverting to his name professionally and naming her oldest son after him. On 13 June 1854 she married, at Penang, Malaya, Thomas Ross Church (1831&#150;1926), a career officer in the Madras staff corps of the British army in India; with him she travelled over nearly the whole of India, before returning to England in 1860. Marryat and Church had children (seven of whom survived to adulthood) but divorced in 1879. On 5 June 1879 she married her second husband, Colonel Francis Lean (1832?&#150;1902), an officer in the Royal Marine light infantry. Both Church and Lean survived her, though she mentioned neither in her will.<br>
<br>Marryat wrote her first novel, <span class="italic">Love's Conflict</span> (1865), to distract her mind while nursing her children with scarlet fever. Between then and the year of her death she published over seventy-five novels, primarily popular romances for women, many of which were translated into German, French, Swedish, Flemish, and Russian. Her books were popular in the United States, though she received few American royalties because the lack of international copyright laws allowed American publishers to pirate her work freely. Because she was a popular contributor to the subscription-based lending libraries, many of her novels were published in the three-volume format prescribed by the libraries. While most of her heroines superficially conform to Victorian feminine paradigms, she advocated that women should be capable of earning their own livings within the context of femininity; her heroines are often strong-minded, independent working women&#151;actresses, writers, teachers, nurses, and, in one instance, even an estate manager.<br>
<br>Between 1872 and 1876 Marryat edited the monthly periodical <span class="italic">London Society</span>, which featured engravings and light literature aimed at the middle and upper classes. In 1872 she published in two volumes the <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Captain Marryat</span>; while it does not present a complete portrait of her father, the memoir does give details of their family life. A convert to Roman Catholicism, in her later years, she was attracted to spiritualism, a fascination sanctioned by her spiritual director, Father Dalgairns of the Brompton Oratory in London. <span class="italic">There is No Death</span> (1891) gives a detailed account of the various mediums with whom she came in contact and of the s&eacute;ances she attended. <span class="italic">The Risen Dead</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">The Spirit World</span> (1894), as well as several of her novels, deal with the subject. Other non-fiction works include <span class="italic">Tom Tiddler's Ground</span> (1886), an account of her travels in the United States, and <span class="italic">Gup</span> (1868), sketches of garrison life in India.<br>
<br>A woman of varied accomplishments, Marryat added to the roles of author and novelist those of playwright, comedy actress, operatic singer, lecturer, and entertainer; she also managed a school of journalism. On the advice of her doctors following a lengthy illness, she became an actress, performing in a drama that she had written entitled <span class="italic">Her World Against a Lie</span>, produced in London in 1881. At about this time she began to state her year of birth as 1838. Marryat died at St John's Wood, London, where she lived, on 27 October 1899, aged sixty-six, leaving her assets to two of her children and to a close male companion. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery in London.<br>
