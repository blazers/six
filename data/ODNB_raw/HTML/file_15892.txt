<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Laing,  Samuel</span>  (1812&#150;1897), <span class="occ">politician, author, and railway executive</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 12 December 1812. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15891/', "Samuel Laing (1780&#150;1868)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Tours</span> in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, who was younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15890/', "Malcolm Laing")</script>, the historian of Scotland. His mother was Agnes Kelly. Laing was educated at Houghton-le-Spring grammar school, and privately by Richard Wilson, a fellow of St John's, Cambridge. He entered that college as a pensioner on 5 July 1827, graduated BA as second wrangler in 1831, and was also second Smith's prizeman. He was elected a fellow of St John's on 17 March 1834, and remained for a time in Cambridge as a mathematical coach. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 10 November 1832, and was called to the bar on 9 June 1837. He married in 1841 Mary, daughter of Captain Cowan RN; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Soon after being called to the bar Laing was appointed private secretary to Henry Labouchere, afterwards Lord Taunton, then president of the Board of Trade. Upon the formation of the railway department of that office in 1842 he was appointed secretary, and thenceforth distinguished himself as an authority upon railways under successive presidents of the Board of Trade. He declared that &#145;the public have never permanently benefited from competition from different lines of railway&#146;. He advocated stricter vetting of railway bills to avoid wasteful competition, but was opposed to government interference in matters of railway operation. He opposed railway trade unionism, but supported self-help benefit societies of railway employees.<br>
<br>At Laing's suggestion there was included in Gladstone's <span class="roman">Railway Act</span> of 1844 the requirement that each newly authorized railway should provide, in each direction of its lines, third class, covered carriages, in which the charge per passenger mile should not exceed 1<i>d</i>. The trains so provided became known as parliamentary trains. This legislation was largely responsible for the proportion of third class passengers to total railway passengers rising from under 28 per cent in 1844 to over 78 per cent in 1875. In 1845 Laing was appointed a member of the railway commission, presided over by Lord Dalhousie, and drew up the chief reports on the railway schemes of that period.<br>
<br>In 1846 Laing resigned his position as secretary at the Board of Trade and two years later was appointed chairman and managing director of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. Under his management passenger traffic nearly doubled in five years and shareholders were paid a steady 6 per cent dividend.<br>
<br>However, in 1852 Laing resigned his chairmanship of the Brighton line to pursue his interests in the City of London. In 1860 he was, for a few months, financial secretary to the Treasury before Lord Palmerston persuaded him to become financial minister to the crown in India. At this post he was successful in reducing military expenditure during a brief period of peace.<br>
<br>During Laing's absence from the chair of the Brighton company (1852&#150;67) and his period of service in India, the directors of the company were less circumspect than they had been under his authority. In the boom years of 1865&#150;6, they built many branch lines to protect the company's territory from incursions from the South Eastern Railway. Following the failure of the firm of Overend and Gurney in October 1866, when the Brighton company was on the verge of bankruptcy, as a result of its speculative railway ventures, its directors, in some desperation, persuaded Laing to resume the chair.<br>
<br>With the able and dedicated assistance of Sir Allen Sarle, who was company secretary from 1867, and secretary and general manager from 1886, Laing led an innovative and financially successful company until his retirement in 1894. In 1881 the company pioneered electric lighting in passenger carriages while the comfort of its customers was enhanced by the widespread introduction of Pullman cars.<br>
<br>Laing resigned from the chairmanship of the Brighton line in 1852. In July of that year he was returned to parliament as a Liberal for the Wick district, which he represented until 1857 (when he lost his seat for opposing British intervention in China). He was re-elected in April 1859. He was financial secretary to the Treasury from June to October 1860, then appointed as financial minister in India on the governor general's council; a post he held until 1865 when he was again elected MP for Wick in July 1865. He was rejected for that constituency in 1868, but was returned for Orkney and Shetland in 1873, and sat without interruption until he retired from parliament in 1885. Though a staunch Liberal, he was opposed to what he considered the anti-imperialist leanings of Gladstone; he published in 1884 a careful and moderate indictment of what would now be called Little Englandism in <span class="italic">England's Foreign Policy</span>.<br>
<br>It was not until Laing had turned seventy and retired from parliament that he came before the public prominently as an author. His <span class="italic">Modern Science and Modern Thought</span> appeared in 1885 and was very widely read, being, in fact, an admirable popular exposition of the speculations of Darwin, Huxley, and Spencer, and the incompatibility of the data of modern science and &#145;revealed religion&#146;. A supplementary chapter to the third edition (1886) contained a fairly crushing reply to Gladstone's defence of the book of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>. It was followed by <span class="italic">A Modern Zoroastrian</span>, 1887, <span class="italic">Problems of the Future, and other Essays</span>, 1889, <span class="italic">The Antiquity of Man</span>, 1891, and <span class="italic">Human Origins</span>, 1892, all written in a similar easy and interesting style. Without possessing in themselves any great scientific value, these works showed Laing's reading, especially in anthropology, to have been extremely wide, and furnished people with general ideas on subjects of importance which, if discussed in a less attractive form, would probably have passed unheeded.<br>
<br>Laing died, aged eighty-six, at his home, Rockhills, Sydenham Hill, London, on 6 August 1897, and was buried on 10 August in the extramural cemetery, Brighton.<br>
<br>Laing's writings are remarkable as the relaxations of a man who had spent over half a century almost exclusively immersed in business affairs. He never attained to quite the same thoroughness and grip of his subject as his father, but he had much the same gift of lucid exposition, and the same freedom from self-consciousness or affectation.<br>
