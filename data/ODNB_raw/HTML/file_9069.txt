<span class="headword">Fairborne, Sir  Stafford</span>  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;1742), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9068/', "Sir Palmes Fairborne (1644&#150;1680)")</script>, governor of Tangier, and his wife, Margery, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Devereux (<i>d</i>. 1694). He received a series of army commissions from 1678 onwards, holding these simultaneously with his naval posts, the first of which was as a &#145;king's letter boy&#146; in 1681. In June 1685 Fairborne was lieutenant of the <i>Bonadventure</i> at Tangier, and during the illness of his captain commanded the ship in a successful encounter with some Sal&eacute; vessels at Mamora. On 12 July 1686 he was promoted to command the <i>Half Moon</i>, a Sal&eacute; prize, and in August 1688 he was appointed to the <i>Richmond</i> fireship, from which, after the revolution, he was moved successively to the <i>Phoenix</i> and the <i>Warspite</i> (70 guns); he commanded the latter at the battle of Beachy Head on 30 June 1690. At the siege of Cork, in the following September, he served on shore under the duke of Marlborough. Thus far his rapid rise can be attributed largely to the patronage of Arthur Herbert, earl of Torrington, an old friend of his father.<br>
<br>In 1692 Fairborne commanded the <i>Elizabeth</i> (70 guns) at the battle of Barfleur, and in 1693 the <i>Monck</i> (52 guns) in the fleet under Sir George Rooke, which on 19 June, while escorting the Smyrna convoy, was disastrously scattered by the French off Cape St Vincent. Between 1693 and 1697 he commanded, in quick succession, the <i>Grafton</i>, <i>Vanguard</i>, <i>London</i> (twice), <i>Victory</i> (twice), <i>Defiance</i>, and <i>Albemarle</i>, a rate of turnover which gave Fairborne great difficulty when pursuing his arrears of pay. During this period, and indeed throughout his career, he was always jealous of pay and promotion. For many years he regularly pressed his claims to advancement on influential political figures such as the dukes of Ormond and Shrewsbury, the earl of Oxford, and Lord Godolphin, attempting to reclaim the arrears allegedly due on his late mother's pension, and trying to obtain additional employment ashore to supplement his naval income. In May 1699 he was appointed to the <i>Torbay</i>, but as she was not ready, he was transferred to the <i>Suffolk</i>, which he commanded until the end of the year as senior officer in the Downs or at Spithead. In January 1700 he was appointed to the <i>Tilbury</i>, in which he went to Newfoundland with a convoy, and to clear the coast of pirates. He then took the convoy to Cadiz and into the Mediterranean. By March 1701 he was back at Cadiz, and soon after that he returned to England. In June he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, and on 3 November he was knighted in a ceremony which occurred aboard ship as he carried William III back from the king's last-ever visit to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In 1702 Fairborne was appointed, with his flag in the <i>St George</i>, to a command in the fleet under Rooke, which failed in its attempt on Cadiz, despite Fairborne's adroit handling of the inshore squadron. He had strenuously supported a more immediate attack than the one which took place. During the later victory at Vigo he moved into the <i>Essex</i>, a ship of lighter draught. He was afterwards left under Sir Cloudesley Shovell to bring the prizes home, a service which, in spite of exceptionally bad weather, was safely accomplished by 17 November 1702. In February 1703 Fairborne refused to take command of the West Indies squadron, and, believing that in consequence the Admiralty had refused to employ him again, he tried to challenge George Churchill&#151;the first commissioner he happened to meet&#151;to a duel, which was averted only by the arrest of both men. Shortly afterwards, Fairborne returned to favour and was made vice-admiral of the red, flying his flag in the <i>Association</i> and joining Shovell in the Mediterranean before returning with him to England in November. From the Downs the squadron was ordered into the Thames, and on the evening of 25 November anchored for the night off the Gunfleet. There the great storm of 1703, which broke out the next day, found them. They were unable to weigh, but in the early morning of 27 November the <i>Association</i> was blown violently from her anchors, and, with the wind at WSW, was driven helplessly across the North Sea to the coast of the Netherlands. After many dangers and narrow escapes she reached G&ouml;teborg, underwent refitting, and was finally able to return to the Thames.<br>
<br>In 1704 Fairborne hoisted his flag on board the <i>Shrewsbury</i>, in the fleet under Shovell at Lisbon, and, when Shovell went to the Mediterranean, he remained in command of the ships in the channel with his flag in the <i>Exeter</i>. He accompanied Shovell to the Mediterranean in 1705, and was present at the siege and capture of Barcelona in September and October. In 1706 he was again employed on the home station, commanding the squadrons sent against La Rochelle and Rochfort in May, and at the capture of Ostend in June. Fairborne distinguished himself in both actions by moving to smaller craft to take personal command of dangerous inshore operations; as the historian of Queen Anne's navy said of his cavalier attitude to such operations, and his unwillingness to delegate authority, &#145;Fairborne courted danger like a mistress&#146;  (Owen, 10).<br>
<br>Fairborne was MP for Rochester from 1705 to 1710, usually supporting the whig administration; and in February 1706 he was appointed a member of the council of the lord admiral, a post from which he retired in June 1708. Following Shovell's death in October 1707 he was promoted admiral of the white on 7 January 1708, and on 21 December 1708 he became admiral of the fleet; but the return to office in the Admiralty of his adversary, Edward Russell, earl of Orford, in 1709 effectively ended his prospects of further naval service. In 1713 he declined the position of commissioner for disbanding the marine regiments in the hope of returning to the Admiralty. His long-standing financial concerns were, finally, addressed by the award in 1715 of a pension of &pound;600 p.a. in lieu of half pay.<br>
<br>Fairborne had married first, on 24 June 1694, Dorothy Fane (<i>d</i>. 1707), and second, on 20 October 1708, Rebecca, daughter of Colonel Thomas Paston. Fairborne died on 11 November 1742, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His younger brother, William, who served with him in the <i>Victory</i> as a lieutenant, had died on 5 October 1708, in command of the <i>Centurion</i> at Leghorn.<br>
