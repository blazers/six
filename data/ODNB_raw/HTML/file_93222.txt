<span class="headword">Meysenbug, Baroness  Malwida Rivalier  von</span>  (1816&#150;1903), <span class="occ">writer and exile</span>, was born Malwida Rivalier in Kassel, the capital of Hesse, on 28 October 1816, the daughter of Carl Philipp Rivalier (1779&#150;1847), a courtier of Elector Wilhelm I of Hesse, created Baron von Meysenbug by Wilhelm II in 1825, and his wife, Ernestine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hansell (1784&#150;1861). Malwida rebelled against her family's social and political conservatism, enthusiastically welcoming the European revolutions of 1848. In 1850 she attended and then taught at a school in Hamburg dedicated to the further education of women and run by Karl Fr&ouml;bel, a nephew of Friedrich Fr&ouml;bel, founder of the Kindergarten movement. While on a trip to Berlin in the spring of 1852, Malwida was visited by the police, who took away her papers on the grounds that she had been consorting with democrats. Fearing arrest, she fled to London, recalling in her celebrated autobiography <span class="italic">Memoiren einer Idealistin</span> (<span class="italic">Memoirs of an Idealist</span>, published in French in 1869, in German in 1875, and in an abridged English translation under the title <span class="italic">Rebel in a Crinoline</span> in 1937) the &#145;pleasant feeling of freedom&#146; that came over her &#145;when no passport was demanded&#146; on her arrival in England  (<span class="italic">Rebel</span>, 129).<br>
<br>Malwida's destination was the home in St John's Wood of Gottfried and Johanna Kinkel, who had settled there in January 1851 after Kinkel's famous flight from Spandau prison, where he had begun a life sentence for insurrection. The Kinkels had made friends among English liberals; Gottfried lectured on art history and languages at schools and colleges, and Johanna, in Malwida's view &#145;the outstanding woman of the emigration&#146;, gave piano and singing lessons at home  (<span class="italic">Rebel</span>, 170). Through the Kinkels, Malwida found lodgings in St John's Wood and started taking pupils. She contemplated becoming a governess in an English family, but identified two barriers: first, a governess was a sort of social &#145;polyp&#146;, &#145;a something between master and servant, with limited social consideration, the narrowest horizon of pleasures and recreation, and an immoderately long list of tasks and duties&#146;. Second, governesses in England were generally expected to be professing Christians and to accompany their young charges to church  (ibid., 137). As Malwida's rebellion against her family had been partly motivated by her loss of religious belief as a result of reading Ludwig Feuerbach and embracing his &#145;religion of humanity&#146;, this part of a governess's duties was impossible for her. Moving in refugee circles, however, she soon found a household unorthodox enough to embrace her. This was the home of the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Alexander Herzen (1812&#150;1870), whom she met in 1852 at the Kinkels' house. Herzen, separated from his wife, who had recently died in France, had three young children to bring up. He and Malwida agreed that she would live in the house, having freedom to practise her progressive educational principles on the children, and that she would not be paid. She would therefore have the status of an intellectual and social equal with her &#145;employer&#146;. She joined the family in their house at Euston Square at the end of 1853, and, though living under the same roof, she and Herzen corresponded regularly about education and politics. The arrangement worked well until 1856, when Russian friends of Herzen came to stay and interfered with Malwida's dealings with the children. Malwida left abruptly, going to live alone once more in lodgings in St John's Wood.<br>
<br>For the next few years Malwida consorted with many of the European exiles she had met through Herzen and the Kinkels&#151;among them Mazzini, Kossuth, and Garibaldi&#151;and spent her days writing for English and German magazines, teaching pupils, and visiting the poor in Whitechapel. She recalled in her memoirs that hundreds of poor German families lived in the district, eking out a living from cleaning animal hides or playing street organs. Helped by Mazzini, she set up a German workers' club, attending their meetings and processions and becoming involved with radical leaders such as the chartist Ernest Jones. She also interested herself in female education. In 1859 she assisted Clementia Taylor, wife of the radical MP Peter Taylor, in seeking patronage for a female professorship in medicine. The plan, originating with the Langham Place group of women's rights supporters, led by Barbara Bodichon, was to found a women's hospital and train women doctors. Gradually, relations with Herzen thawed. Malwida translated his memoirs into German in 1859; in 1862 she published an English translation of Tolstoy, as <span class="italic">Childhood and Youth</span>. She was to devote the rest of her long life to the welfare of Herzen's daughters, particularly the younger one, Olga. She obtained Herzen's permission to take Olga to Italy with her in 1862. Malwida remained in Italy until her death in Rome on 26 April 1903. During the 1860s and 1870s she corresponded with Wagner, whom she had met when he visited London in the summer of 1855, and Nietzsche, whom she came to know in Italy. She was cremated in Rome without a religious ceremony.<br>
<br>Malwida von Meysenbug was an early enthusiast for female emancipation and education; she was free-thinking, independent, and resourceful. Her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> give a detailed picture of an unusual life lived among interesting and influential people at a time of rapid change across Europe. The years she spent in London among the exile community are vividly brought to life.<br>
