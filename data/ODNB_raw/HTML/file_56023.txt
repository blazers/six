<span class="headword">Leakey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Nicol]</span>,  Mary Douglas</span>  (1913&#150;1996), <span class="occ">archaeologist and palaeoanthropologist</span>, was born on 6 February 1913 at Trevor Square, Knightsbridge, London, the only child of Erskine Edward Nicol (<i>d</i>. 1926), landscape artist, and his wife, Cecilia Marion Frere (<i>d</i>. 1946), an amateur painter. After spending the First World War years in London, the Nicol family travelled regularly to south-west France, where Mary experienced her first encounters with archaeology. Father and daughter visited cave-art sites and collected artefacts from excavators' spoil heaps, an acceptable practice at the time, which she recalled in her autobiography, <span class="italic">Disclosing the Past</span> (1984), as &#145;powerfully and magically exciting&#146;  (p. 25). At about ten years old, she began drawing without any formal instruction, taking to it &#145;naturally and with pleasure on my own initiative&#146;  (p. 14). When she was thirteen her father died in France after a short illness. She and her mother returned to London, where she was expelled from two Roman Catholic convent schools in quick succession, on the second occasion for deliberately causing an explosion in a chemistry class. Thereafter the rebellious young lady was educated by private tutors and took up gliding as a hobby.<br>
<br>Mary Nicol decided to pursue a career in archaeology, but as her lack of formal education precluded admission to university, she attended lectures in geology at University College, London University, and in archaeology given by Mortimer Wheeler at the London Museum, and wrote to archaeologists offering her services at their excavations. Her first published drawings of stone tools from Dorothy Liddell's excavations at Hembury Fort in Devon brought her to the notice of the archaeologist Gertrude Caton-Thompson. In 1933 Caton-Thompson introduced her to the archaeologist and palaeoanthropologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31343/', "Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (1903&#150;1972)")</script>, who asked Mary to illustrate his book <span class="italic">Adam's Ancestors</span> (1934). He was ten years older than Mary and at the time married to Henrietta Wilfrida (Frida) Leakey (1902&#150;1993), who was expecting their second child. Shortly after his son Colin was born on 13 December 1933, to the intense disapproval of both his and Mary's families and colleagues, Louis left Frida, whom he later divorced to marry Mary in the register office at Ware on 24 December 1936. A successful personal and professional partnership of some thirty years followed, until Mary experienced the anguish of Louis's physical and mental decline in the years preceding his death in 1972.<br>
<br>Louis and Mary Leakey settled in Kenya, and three sons were born, all of whom have had notable careers: Jonathan Harry Erskine (<i>b</i>. 1940), Richard Erskine (<i>b</i>. 1944), and Philip (<i>b</i>. 1949). A daughter, Deborah, was born in 1943 and died from dysentery at the age of three months. On the birth of her first child, Mary wrote that &#145;I quite liked having a baby&#151;I think I won't put it more strongly than that&#151;but I had no intention of allowing motherhood to disrupt my work as an archaeologist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disclosing the Past</span>, 79&#150;80). In 1952 the Leakeys built a permanent home at Langata, an outer suburb of Nairobi. In the 1950s Louis's involvement in Kenyan politics against the Mau Mau movement for Kenyan independence brought fears for the family's safety. An attempt was made to sabotage Mary's car and she wore a pistol on her belt at night.<br>
<br>Mary Leakey quickly established a reputation as a competent excavator of Stone Age sites. In 1951 she recorded some 1600 Stone Age rock paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of central Tanzania, a task she regarded as one of the highlights of her life and work, which were published many years later in <span class="italic">Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania</span> (1983). On 6 October 1948, on Rusinga Island near the west coast of Lake Victoria, Mary discovered part of a skull of <i>Proconsul africanus</i>, an 18 million-year-old Miocene ape, in which there was tremendous public interest. Some of her favourite finds&#151;a collection of Miocene fossil insects, fruits, and seeds which she and Louis stumbled upon during a cigarette break&#151;were also made at Rusinga Island.<br>
<br>The site that will always be associated with Mary Leakey is Olduvai Gorge, a canyon in northern Tanzania containing rich collections of fossils and artefacts spanning about the last 2 million years. This became her second home, where she enjoyed fieldwork and research, accompanied by her pack of beloved dalmatian dogs, of which she was a well-known breeder. At Olduvai on 17 July 1959 she made one of the most famous fossil discoveries of all time, the skull of a 1.8 million-year-old early human relative whom Louis named <i>Zinjanthropus</i> (now <i>Australopithecus</i> or <i>Paranthropus</i>) <i>boisei</i>. Television coverage of the find made the Leakeys household names all over the world and brought them desperately needed funding from the National Geographic Society. Mary laboured under the hot sun, meticulously recording scatters of early stone tools and fossil bones, setting new standards for archaeological fieldwork, while Louis concentrated on fund-raising and lecturing. The technical details of her work are published in volumes 3 (1971) and 5 (1994) of the <span class="italic">Olduvai Gorge</span> series of Cambridge University Press and a popular account is given in <span class="italic">Olduvai Gorge: my Search for Early Man</span> (1979).<br>
<br>Perhaps the crowning triumph of Mary Leakey's remarkable career was the discovery and excavation at her dig at Laetoli in northern Tanzania during 1978&#150;1979 of 3.7 million-year-old trails of early hominid footprints, which proved that hominids walked on two legs more than a million years before the earliest known stone tools.<br>
<br>Mary Leakey was a hard-working, modest, retiring person who disliked the limelight, deferring publicity to her husband. Her son Richard however noted that &#145;Her commitment to detail and perfection made my father's career. He would not have been famous without her. She was much more organized and structured and much more of a technician. He was much more excitable, a magician&#146;  (Holloway, 1994). She was known for her short answers, toughness, and for insisting on correct behaviour, as well as for her fondness for cigars and whisky. Although she famously refused to theorize about human evolution, arguing that &#145;I never felt interpretation was my job. What I came to do was to dig things up and take them out as well as I could&#146;  (Holloway, 1994), she did not escape controversies with colleagues.<br>
<br>Mary's awards include the gold Hubbard medal of the National Geographic Society (jointly with Louis, 1962), honorary doctorates from the universities of the Witwatersrand (1968), Yale (1976), Western Michigan (1980), Chicago (1981), Oxford (1981), Cambridge (1987), Emory (1988), Massachusetts (1988), Brown (1990), and Columbia (1991), the Linnaeus medal of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1978), and the gold medal of the Society of Women Geographers (Washington, 1978). She was elected a fellow of the British Academy (1973), a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1979) and a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences (1987).<br>
<br>Despite blindness in her left eye caused by a thrombosis in 1982, Mary Leakey spent the last years of her life lecturing and fund raising and died peacefully in Nairobi on 9 December 1996, &#145;one of the last of a remarkable array of scholars who first exposed humanity's African past to the light of research&#146;  (Tobias). In accordance with her wishes, her ashes were scattered over Lake Natron in Tanzania.<br>
