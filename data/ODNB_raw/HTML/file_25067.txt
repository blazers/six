<span class="headword">Selwyn,  John Richardson</span>  (1844&#150;1898), <span class="occ">bishop of Melanesia</span>, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25066/', "George Augustus Selwyn (1809&#150;1878)")</script>, first bishop of New Zealand, and Sarah Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1907), daughter of Sir John Richardson, was born on 20 May 1844 at Te Waimate, in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. He went to England in 1854, and was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. A noted oarsman but a mediocre scholar, he graduated BA with a third class in the classical tripos in 1866; he proceeded MA in 1870. In 1867 he visited his father in New Zealand, intending to enter the legal profession after his return; but his father's example and the influence of Bishop John Coleridge Patteson decided him to seek ordination in the English church. He was ordained deacon on Trinity Sunday 1869 by his father, who was then bishop of Lichfield. His first curacy was at nearby Alrewas, where he remained for a year and a half. He then acted as curate-in-charge at St George's, Wolverhampton, where the vicar was absent, having quarrelled with his parishioners. Selwyn's tact and energy resulted in his becoming vicar of St George's, but on hearing of Bishop Patteson's death in 1871 he offered himself as a missionary to the Melanesian mission. He married Clara Long, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Innes, on 16 January 1872. In February 1873 they set sail for Melanesia, and reached Norfolk Island in October 1873. An attack of rheumatism <i>en route</i> was Selwyn's first warning of the debilitating illness he would suffer in later life.<br>
<br>Selwyn's demonstrated ability, family legacy, and education made him an obvious choice to succeed Bishop Patteson. On 18 February 1877 he was consecrated bishop of Melanesia at Nelson, New Zealand. In December 1877 his wife, who had rejoined him after a visit to England, died in childbirth, and in the next year he lost his father. Despite these blows Selwyn persevered in developing the Melanesian mission along the lines pioneered by his father. Well-educated young gentlemen of pronounced high-church principles formed the backbone of his missionary force. Close ties were maintained with Eton, Oxford, and Cambridge. The centrepiece of the mission was its college on Norfolk Island to which young Melanesian islanders were carried on the mission schooner, <i>Southern Cross</i>, for short periods of instruction. Although it was not Selwyn's express policy to encourage British territorial annexations in the south Pacific, his links to influential circles inevitably gave his mission a quasi-political character which differentiated it from other evangelical operations in the region.<br>
<br>While visiting England, Selwyn made a second marriage, to Annie Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mort, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19338/', "Thomas Sutcliffe Mort")</script>, merchant, on 11 August 1885, and they returned to his diocese. In 1889, however, his continuing rheumatic afflictions compelled him to return again to England, and he arrived home in 1890. Surgery on his right leg left him permanently disabled, which forced him to give up his work in Melanesia. After recovering his health he was asked to become master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, a position he held until his death at Cambridge on 12 February 1898.<br>
<br>It was largely through Selwyn's influence that the home mission named Cambridge House was started in London. Selwyn was also unusually successful in encouraging Cambridge undergraduates to take up missionary work, both in England and overseas.<br>
