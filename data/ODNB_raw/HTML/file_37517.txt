<span class="headword">Haslam, Sir  Alfred Seale</span>  (1844&#150;1927), <span class="occ">engineer and politician</span>, was born on 27 October 1844 in Derby, the fourth of the five sons and the fourth of the eight children of William Haslam, ironmaster of Derby, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Joseph Smith of Branstone, Staffordshire. He was educated privately in Derby and was taken into apprenticeship with the Midland Railway Company. Once qualified, he joined the firm of Sir William G. Armstrong in London as a hydraulic engineer. In 1868, in partnership with his father and financed by his uncle Joseph Smith, he purchased the old Union foundry in Derby.<br>
<br>He started the Haslam engineering works with a staff of twenty and by 1871 he was able to repay the loan from his uncle and later dissolve the partnership with his father, leaving himself in sole charge. By 1876 the firm had become a limited company. In 1875 he married Annie (<i>d</i>. 1924), the daughter of Thomas Tatam, farmer, of Little Eaton, Derbyshire. They had three sons, one of whom was killed in the First World War, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Haslam was a perceptive developer of the promising research of others, having that rare combination of commercial acumen and technical expertise, making him one of the great engineers. He could see that refrigeration would bring about a complete change in people's lifestyles and in 1880 he took over the patents of the Bell&#150;Coleman cold-air machine and developed what was known as the dry air refrigerator. The excellence of this machine eventually gave him a monopoly in refrigerated shipping. His equipment on board ship and on land enabled British people to enjoy meat, fruits, and other perishable products from countries overseas. On 5 October 1881 the SS <i>Orient</i> docked at Plymouth with 150 tons of frozen Australian meat on board, an event described vividly by many newspapers (for example, <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, 5 October).<br>
<br>By 1900 the dry air refrigerator had lost its place to chemical machines using carbon dioxide or ammonia. Haslam produced equipment using these refrigerants for most purposes where cold was required, such as meat freezing stations, meat cargoes on board ship, cold stores of all kinds for perishable food, ice factories, chemical works, dye works, and works for the manufacture and storage of explosives and ammunition on land and on warships.<br>
<br>Haslam also played a busy role in public life. In 1879 he became a Derby town councillor and in 1886 was made a JP for the borough. In 1890 he was elected mayor of Derby and in 1891 became JP for the county. His biggest achievement in his year of office was the replacement of the old William Strutt Infirmary. He invited Queen Victoria to lay the foundation stone for the new Derbyshire Royal Infirmary and at the end of her visit she knighted Haslam (1891).<br>
<br>Politically Haslam was prominent in the Liberal Unionist cause. In 1892 he unsuccessfully contested Derby, but he entered parliament in 1900 as a representative of Newcastle under Lyme, retaining his seat until the election of 1906. He was a generous benefactor&#151;for example, he presented bronze statues of Queen Victoria to Newcastle under Lyme, Derby, and London.<br>
<br>His fellowships and honours were numerous and included membership of the Iron and Steel Institute, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Institution, and the Institute of Refrigeration, of which he was president in 1914&#150;15. He was a liveryman of the City of London and in 1905 was presented with the freedom of Newcastle under Lyme, having occupied the chair of mayor for three consecutive years (1901&#150;4).<br>
<br>Haslam died at the St Pancras Hotel, London, on 13 January 1927 while on a business trip. He was buried in Morley churchyard, Derbyshire. Two sons and a daughter predeceased him.<br>
