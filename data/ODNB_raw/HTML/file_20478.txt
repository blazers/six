<span class="headword">O'Byrne,  William Richard</span>  (1823&#150;1896), <span class="occ">naval biographer</span>, was elder son of Robert O'Byrne, of Cabinteely, near Dublin, and his wife, Martha Trougher, daughter of Joseph Clarke of Norwich. His brother, Robert Henry O'Byrne, was the author of the <span class="italic">Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1848). He was educated at University College School, London (1838&#150;9).<br>
<br>O'Byrne was scarcely out of his teens and &#145;a civilian, previously unconnected with the Service&#146;  (O'Byrne, v), when he had the idea of compiling and publishing a record of the service of every living naval officer of the executive branch. Permitted access to Admiralty records, he worked at this for six years, publishing the first parts in 1845, and completed the volume of 1400 closely printed pages, on nearly 5000 officers, in 1849. The labour was great for the Admiralty records, his major source, were in a semi-chaotic state. He had extensive correspondence with his subjects, but he seems to have checked their statements against official documents in all cases. The <span class="italic">Naval Biographical Dictionary</span> is a work of almost unparalleled accuracy&#151;a fact which Sir John Laughton had many occasions to test and to prove during the compilation of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. A factual compilation, the dictionary is an invaluable reference work. It was not, however, a financial success for the author. An edition of 2000 was sold at 42<i>s</i>. a copy; but out of the proceeds &pound;100 was all that O'Byrne received for six years' labour and expenses. The Admiralty awarded him &pound;100, and Sir Francis Thornhill Baring (Lord Northbrook) appointed him its librarian; but Baring left office shortly afterwards and his successor, the duke of Northumberland, refused to confirm the appointment. A testimonial from naval officers was started, and, at a meeting at the Royal United Service Institution, O'Byrne was presented with a piece of plate and a purse of &pound;400. In 1857 he was specially elected a member of the Athenaeum.<br>
<br>O'Byrne married, in 1851, Emily, eldest daughter of John Troughear Handy of Malmesbury, Wiltshire; they had one daughter. Mrs O'Byrne predeceased her husband. From about 1856 to 1880, O'Byrne was a navy agent in London with his brother, Robert (barrister, Lincoln's Inn), as O'Byrne Brothers. In 1859 he began a second edition of the dictionary, updated and containing data on officers of the civil branches of the service. This&#151;which was not as accurate as the first edition&#151;did not pay, and was not carried beyond the letter G, with the less regret on O'Byrne's part, as at about that time, on the death of his cousin Georgiana O'Byrne, he succeeded to the Cabinteely estate in co. Wicklow, which had been in the family for many generations, though probably not the fifty-four that was claimed. In 1872&#150;3 he was high sheriff of Wicklow, and was Liberal MP for the county from 1874 to 1880. He favoured denominational education, further amendment of the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> in Ireland, and Irish home rule.<br>
<br>O'Byrne's property was heavily mortgaged, and on the depreciation of Irish land he was unable to pay the interest. The mortgagees foreclosed, and he was left practically destitute. Years of privation and struggle followed. In 1884 he was awarded &pound;100 from the royal bounty, and tried to get the Admiralty to appoint him officially, at a regular salary, to prepare a new edition of his dictionary. The Admiralty refused to do this, or to help to further the project, as&#151;with their improved records system&#151;the work would be useless to them, while the fact that it would not pay a publisher to take it up seemed to show that the public did not want it. During his later years O'Byrne's health broke down, and he was mainly dependent on his daughter. In summer 1896 he was granted &pound;125 from the royal bounty, but it was too late. He died at 258 Fulham Road, South Kensington, London, on 7 July 1896. His <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span> was reprinted in 1986 and remains a standard work of reference.<br>
