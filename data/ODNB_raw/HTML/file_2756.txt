<span class="headword">Bodkin, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1791&#150;1874), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, the son of Peter Bodkin, descended from a well-established family in the county of Galway, was born at Islington on 4 August 1791. His mother was Sarah Gilbert of Lichfield. He was educated at the Islington Academy. In 1812 he married Sarah Sophia Poland (<i>d</i>. 1848), the eldest daughter of Peter Raymond Poland of Winchester Hall, Highgate. He was called to the bar in 1824 by Gray's Inn, of which society he became a bencher in 1826. For several years he worked on the home circuit. He practised in criminal law at the Middlesex, Westminster, and Kent sessions, and at the central criminal court, and was made recorder of Dover in 1832.<br>
<br>In 1821 Bodkin became honorary secretary to the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity; in the same year he published <span class="italic">Brief observations on the bill now pending in parliament to amend the laws relative to the relief of the poor in England</span>. His interest in poor-law reform probably influenced his decision to enter politics. At the general election in 1841 he was returned to parliament as a Conservative at Rochester, as the colleague of James Stoddart Douglas, defeating Lord Melgund by two votes. He supported Peel over free trade in 1846, and was defeated easily in 1847. He did not stand in 1852, but was defeated at a by-election for Rochester in 1856. He was responsible for the passage of a statute stipulating that confirmed paupers should be chargeable to the common funds of the unions. Bodkin's act was passed for one year only; but it was continued and extended.<br>
<br>In 1859 Bodkin was appointed assistant judge of the Middlesex sessions. He married again on 25 March 1865, his second wife being Sarah Constance Miles, the daughter of Joseph Johnson Miles JP of Highgate. On 3 August 1867 he received a knighthood. He was for many years counsel to the Treasury, and the president of the Society of Arts, of which he was one of the earliest and most enthusiastic members. Bodkin was also a deputy lieutenant of Middlesex and chairman of the Metropolitan assessment sessions. An attack of cancer in the cheek led him to resign his office some weeks before his death, on 26 March 1874, at his house, on West Hill, Highgate. He was buried in Highgate cemetery. He had one son and one daughter.<br>
