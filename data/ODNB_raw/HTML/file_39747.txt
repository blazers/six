<span class="headword">Mather,  Joseph</span>  (1737&#150;1804), <span class="occ">file cutter and songwriter</span>, was born either at Chelmorton, Derbyshire, or in Cack Alley, Sheffield. Nothing is known of his parentage or early life but after serving an eight-year apprenticeship (1751&#150;9) Mather became a journeyman file cutter (otherwise known as file hewer) in the Sheffield workshop of Nicholas Jackson. At one stage he seems to have become a &#145;small mester&#146; himself before reverting to journeyman status. He struggled to maintain himself, his wife, Nell, and their five (or more) children, and he served terms of imprisonment for debt in the town gaol at Pudding Lane.<br>
<br>Starting in the 1770s, Mather began to supplement his income by making up and setting to well-known tunes ballads which he sang at fairs and races, in streets and taverns. He could read, but his inability to write meant that the process was entirely oral, although later some items were taken down from his dictation and printed on broadsides:<blockquote>our author used to &#145;raise the wind&#146; by vending his songs in the streets, seated on a grinder's donkey, or on the back of Ben Sharp's bull. Should it chance to begin raining, he would ride the animal into the nearest alehouse. (<span class="italic">Songs</span>, vii)</blockquote>Mather's high spirits were reflected in his lively celebrations of the pleasures of artisan life, from horse-racing, bull-baiting, and cock-fighting to singing, dancing, and drinking, but he turned more and more to virulent invective, drawing on vocabulary and imagery which derived from his assiduous reading of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. For several years he was a Methodist, though by 1787 he had left the sect after succumbing to the temptation of the alehouse and falling into sin. So said a contemporary, James Montgomery  (Hobday, 78); a more recent commentator suggests that Mather rejected &#145;Methodism's egocentric obsession with individual salvation for a morality based on solidarity with his fellows&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>An orientation of this kind is undoubtedly reflected in many of Mather's songs, of which the best-known was &#145;Watkinson and his Thirteens&#146;, written in 1787 in response to the campaign led by the master cutler of the day to reduce workers' perquisites, and hence their income. Its subject, Jonathan Watkinson, was forced on a memorable occasion to leave the theatre when the audience in the gods struck up the song with its vitriolic chorus:<blockquote>
<div>And may the odd knife his great carcase dissect,<br>
</div>
<div>Lay open his vitals for men to inspect<br>
</div>
<div>A heart full as black as the infernal gulph,<br>
</div>
<div>In that greedy blood-sucking bone-scraping wolf.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Songs</span>, 63)</blockquote>In the same song Mather wished &#145;Success to our Sovereign who peaceably reigns&#146;  (<span class="italic">Songs</span>, 65), yet only six years later he was identified with the Jacobin movement in Sheffield and parodying the national anthem as &#145;God Save Great Thomas Paine&#146; (1793). In 1795, after what has been called Sheffield's rehearsal for Peterloo  (Palmer, <span class="italic">The Sound of History</span>, 26), when the local volunteer corps fired on an unarmed crowd in Norfolk Street, Mather wrote ballads attacking the &#145;Raddle-neck'd Tups&#146;, as he called them, and their commander, &#145;beef-headed Bob&#146; (Colonel Robert Althorpe).<br>
<br>Mather's being bound over to keep the peace for a year, and thus prevented from singing in public, may date from this time. He wrote again when the ban had expired&#151;one of his songs has the refrain &#145;I was muzzled a year&#146;&#151;but gradually reverted from radicalism to religion in the shape of Wesleyan Methodism. One of his last pieces, &#145;Repentance&#146;, stayed in the Methodist repertory for many years, while in a different context&#151;that of &#145;loosings&#146; and &#145;foot ales&#146;, theatre galleries and public houses&#151;his radical songs remained in oral tradition.<br>
<br>Embittered by illness and poverty, Mather declined into his last years and died at his home in Pond Hill in Sheffield on 12 June 1804. The affection felt in the town for this stocky, pugnacious man was demonstrated at his funeral in St Paul's Church when &#145;his remains were followed to the grave by many of the working classes of the town, who regarded him as their champion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Songs</span>, x).<br>
<br>In 1811 fifty-four items by Mather were gathered together and printed under the title <span class="italic">A Collection of Songs, Poems, Satires, &amp;c. Written by the Late Joseph Mather</span>. The publisher was John Crome (1757&#150;1832), a Scot who settled in Sheffield and became a lifelong radical. A further edition of Mather's songs appeared in 1862 with a memoir by John Wilson which included a great deal of information culled from veteran cutlers. After a long period of eclipse during which the songs might be briefly quoted in histories of the cutlery trades, Mather's work was rediscovered in the 1960s through the influence of the folk music revival of the time, with its interest in industrial material. Astonishingly enough, one of his songs, <span class="roman">Roundlegs</span> (about a local carter) was found to be still circulating orally  (Smith, 295). Other pieces of his were revived, in Sheffield and elsewhere. Anthologists sought them out. The &#145;filesmith&#146;  (Armitage, 320) or &#145;sansculotte&#146;  (Hobday, 61) poet found fresh audiences.<br>
