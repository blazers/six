<span class="headword">Venner,  Thomas</span>  (1608/9&#150;1661), <span class="occ">Fifth Monarchist</span>, was probably born in Littleham, Devon. By 1633 he had moved to London, where he worked as a cooper and became a member of the Coopers' Company, probably in that year. Aged twenty-eight, he testified with the separatists Praisegod Barebone and Stephen More before the high court of admiralty in January 1637 regarding a shipment of wine to Virginia. He subsequently emigrated to Salem, Massachusetts, where he was admitted to its church on 25 February 1638 and became a freeman of the town the following month. A juryman in 1638 and 1640, he served as constable beginning in August 1642. Dissatisfied with life in Salem, he organized some of the settlers to move to Providence Island in the West Indies, but this endeavour apparently collapsed. Venner sold the 40 acres allocated to him in Salem and moved to Boston by 1644. With him were his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1692), and son, <a href="#cosubject_67448">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, baptized at Salem in May 1641; he and Alice would have two more children in Boston, Hannah (<i>b</i>. February 1645) and Samuel (<i>b</i>. February 1650). Venner became a member of the artillery company in 1645, and in October 1648 he organized the coopers of Boston and Charlestown into a trading company.<br>
<br>Some time following the return of Venner and his family to London in October 1651, he embraced Fifth Monarchist tenets. By 1655 he was employed as a master cooper in the Tower, but he was arrested in June and dismissed for allegedly discussing Cromwell's assassination and plotting to blow up the Tower. The government did not take him very seriously, for he was free by winter, when he participated in meetings with other Fifth Monarchists, including John Portman and Arthur Squibb, and republicans such as John Okey and the naval officer John Lawson. Henry Vane's <span class="italic">A Healing Question</span> was the starting point for their discussions about possible joint political action, but they failed to achieve substantive agreement. Okey, Lawson, Portman, and others were arrested in the summer, and officials were searching for Venner. If he was detained, it was only briefly, for in early August he was holding meetings of his Fifth Monarchist congregation at Swan Alley, Coleman Street, London; copies of <span class="italic">Englands Remembrancers</span>, urging the godly to elect proponents of the Good Old Cause to parliament, were distributed. Apparently the members of the church, some of whom had been lured from John Rogers's congregation, were primarily young men and apprentices. During the winter of 1656&#150;7 Venner planned an insurrection, organizing five groups of twenty-five members each, with only one person in each cell knowing details about the other units. Venner and Portman discussed possible co-operation, but Rogers, Thomas Harrison, and John Carew were opposed, while Christopher Feake and Livewell Chapman were apparently not approached. Venner's people obtained maps, telescopes, horses, weapons, and armour, and his son-in-law, William Medley, drafted a manifesto, <span class="italic">A Standard Set Up</span>. It proclaimed the saints' intention to establish theocratic government featuring a sanhedrin and a governing council, each elected by members of gathered churches, and biblically based laws. Land tenures would be reformed and copyhold abolished. The Vennerites intended to confiscate their enemies' property, depositing some of it in a public treasury to support God's work and distributing the rest equally among themselves. Proposed legal reforms, including a hierarchy of courts, beginning with monthly ones in market towns, were aimed at ending law as an instrument of social oppression; judges, like all other officials, would be chosen by the saints alone. The rebels intended to rendezvous at Mile End Green and then march into East Anglia, where they expected many recruits to join them. Venner asked his female followers to distribute copies of the manifesto. The rebels' standard depicted a red lion and the motto &#145;Who shall rouse him up?&#146; As they assembled on 9 April, government troops arrested approximately twenty of them and seized weapons and 500 copies of the manifesto. Taken before Cromwell, Venner and his supporters refused to doff their hats and impolitely referred to the lord protector as &#145;thou&#146;. Although Venner was not tried, he was incarcerated in the Tower until at least February 1659.<br>
<br>By December 1660, when Venner visited Exeter, he was again conspiring, now against the restored monarchy. On Sunday 6 January 1661 he called his followers to arms, urging them not to sheath their swords until the monarchy had been destroyed. Their new manifesto, <span class="italic">A Door of Hope</span>, called for an international crusade, financed by expropriated property, to defeat France, Spain, the Catholic states in Germany, and the papacy, and for a godly society free of poverty, taxation, primogeniture, and capital punishment for theft. With ensigns emblazoned &#145;The Lord God and Gideon&#146; and the battle cry &#145;King Jesus, and the [regicides'] heads upon the gates&#146;, some fifty zealots, including at least one armed woman, rebelled. After temporarily seizing St Paul's, the Vennerites sparred with trained bands before retreating to Kenwood, where troops forced a further withdrawal to Aldersgate. Another rebel band repulsed two files of guards near Bishopsgate. After evading capture at Kenwood on Monday night, the rebels fought in a skirmish early on Wednesday morning near Leadenhall Street. Failing to apprehend the lord mayor or liberate prisoners from the compter, they were routed by the life guards in Wood Street. Venner himself had killed at least three of the approximately twenty loyalists who died, but the Vennerites suffered comparable losses, and Venner himself sustained nineteen wounds. Arraigned at the Old Bailey on the 17th, he initially refused to plead, instead launching into a discourse on the Fifth Monarchy. After finally pleading not guilty, he admitted having participated in the insurrection, but not as leader, for that had been Jesus's role. As Venner prepared to be hanged, drawn, and quartered before his meeting-house on 19 January 1661, he remained defiant, claiming to have acted &#145;according to the best light I had, and according to the best understanding that the Scripture will afford&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Speech</span>, 4). By 21 January thirteen of his compatriots had been executed, and for good measure the government demolished his meeting-house. If the revolt was pathetic and desperate, as some historians have suggested, it was also a manifestation of Venner's fierce conviction that Christ's people, their triumph assured, were literally to take the field against the forces of Antichrist. Resolute in his faith, Venner was a misguided millenarian zealot.<br>
<br>Venner's elder son, <a name="cosubject_67448"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Venner</span>  (<em>b. </em>1641), baptized on 16 May 1641 at Salem, was also to follow his father as a <span class="occ">rebel</span>, taking part in the Monmouth rising of 1685. He served as an officer in an English regiment in the Netherlands, but joined Monmouth after he was cashiered. Commissioned lieutenant-colonel by the duke, Venner served in Monmouth's personal regiment, where Nathaniel Wade was one of his majors. An adviser to Lord Grey during the rebellion, Venner sustained a stomach wound at Bridport on 14 June. After learning of Argyll's defeat, he advised Monmouth to flee. When Grey prevailed on Monmouth to continue fighting, Venner and Thomas Parsons returned to the Netherlands, ostensibly at Robert Ferguson's request, to purchase weapons and ammunition with which to launch an uprising in Ireland. But this may have been a story concocted by Captain John Tillier to save his own life following his capture. During the autumn of 1685 Venner was in Cleves, threatening to avenge his father's death. According to the informer Edmund Everard, he belonged to a faction of militant exiles that included Major John Manley, and was expecting the inauguration of Christ's earthly kingdom by 1688.<br>
