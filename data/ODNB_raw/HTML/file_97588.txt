<span class="headword">Erskine,  Ralph</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, was born on 24 February 1914 at 30 Victoria Road, Mill Hill, London, the second child and only son of George Erskine, shipping clerk, and his wife, Mildred Goepel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gough. His paternal grandparents were Scottish. His father was unambitious, but his mother held a degree from London University and was described by Erskine as intellectually frustrated. Fabian socialists, they sent their son to the Friends' School at Saffron Walden as they admired its values. There Erskine met his future wife, Ruth Monica Francis (1914&#150;1988), and, while he was never a Quaker himself, the pacifist and humanist ideals of the Quakers strongly informed his life and work. Wanting a career involving fresh air and drawing, he entered Regent Street Polytechnic in 1931 to study surveying, but changed to architecture as more interesting; he qualified in 1937. Gordon Cullen, with whom Erskine's ideas of townscape have often been compared, was in the year above. Modernism appealed to Erskine's social conscience, but he quickly became wary of white walls and flat roofs that aped the monumental; he was also suspicious of the classical details he was expected to apply to housing when he went in 1936 to work for C. W. Glover and Partners in Welwyn Garden City, and to factories when a year later he joined Ewart Culpin and Partners.<br>
<br>A study tour of central Europe made little impression on Erskine's work. But in Sweden a social democratic government had come to power in 1932 with a programme of slum clearance and new building that adopted a gentle modernism that Erskine admired as functional and contextual. As he said, &#145;housing is a small &#147;a&#148; architecture. It should be friendly, intimate and have little there to make it monumental&#146;  (BL NSA, interview, 23 Jan 1997). Perhaps it was fortunate that the Swedish climate made it impossible to follow the modernist dogma of flat roofs and thin concrete walling. He headed in May 1939 for Stockholm by ferry and bicycle, and found work there. He then sent for Ruth, and on 29 August 1939 they married. The Second World War broke out a few days later; Erskine lost his job and they were stuck with no work and no money. Yet, as a pacifist, he decided to stay in neutral Sweden. In 1941 he and Ruth built themselves a small house in timber at Lissma, and a few commissions with friends followed. In 1945 they decided not to return to Britain.<br>
<br>Erskine's buildings from the early 1950s were modest in scale, yet many of the structures were experimental. Most were new rural settlements for the timber industry, including Gyttorp, begun in 1945, and Hammarby, begun in 1947. Terraces of housing had arched or steeply pitched roofs in a variety of picturesque forms, set around open spaces, and at Gyttorp accompanied by a school, added in 1955. In his industrial work of this period Erskine sought to break down factories' bulk into smaller components with sculptural forms expressive of their function, as for a cardboard factory at Fors, in 1950&#150;53. In 1948 he designed the Borgafj&auml;ll Hotel in Lapland, with a ski slope on its roof. The Engstr&ouml;m weekend house on Lis&ouml;n took the form of an igloo. In 1954 he designed Sweden's first indoor shopping centre at Lule&aring;, a response to the bleak northern climate; though inspired by North American models, it was more friendly in its variety of shapes, materials, and signage.<br>
<br>A concept for an Arctic town brought Erskine international recognition, initially through a project of 1958 that he presented at the Congr&egrave;s International d'Architecture Moderne at Otterlo in the Netherlands the next year. He selected a south-facing slope, then provided additional shelter by means of a wall of flats that sheltered lower housing in its lee from north winds. The wall was largely blind on the north side, but had extensive areas of south-facing glazing, with balconies devised to avoid cold bridging, and roofs and porches to shield them from snow. In 1963 a revised version won a competition for Svappavaara, a new mining village in northern Sweden, but only the wall building and a few cottages were realized. In 1973 he produced a similar scheme for a new town at Resolute Bay, Canada, but again only part of the perimeter wall was built, with heavy timber sidings, before economic changes obviated the need for the town. Erskine was an associate of Team 10, attending several of its meetings as a way of keeping in touch with architects from southern Europe, but he felt the discussion was often academic and philosophical, with little relevance to the people really using the buildings&#151;very different from the humane approach he admired in Scandinavian architecture. He claimed that his sense of urban planning was indebted to medieval models such as Stockholm's Gamla Stan more than modern ideals, admiring their slow change and limited materials.<br>
<br>The most extensive of Erskine's Arctic works was in Kiruna (1961), consisting of five blocks of offices and flats with curved walls of storey-height slabs and sharply angled roofs, up to thirteen storeys high. Similar forms were realized in brick from 1962 at Barberaren, in Sandviken, where a strong social democratic council offered many commissions. The slabs and curved corners were repeated in the house and office he built for himself at Drottningholm, outside Stockholm, in 1963, two parallel buildings of similar proportions that reflected his informal lifestyle and the strong sense of his office as an extended family. Between 1955 and 1963 his employees and their families moved the office each summer to an island at R&aring;g&ouml;, via <i>Verona</i>, a Thames barge he sailed over from England. The Erskines had a son and three daughters, the youngest born with Down's syndrome, who died in childhood.<br>
<br>In the mid-1960s architectural work in Sweden was limited by the government's encouragement of large-scale system building for its project of a million new homes. Only a few low-rise schemes were built, including Landskrona (1969&#150;70). Instead Erskine secured commissions for town planning and housing work in England. He produced a town planning study for Cambridge University in 1962, which led to his appointment at Clare Hall in July 1964, where he produced an informal design appropriate for a new graduate college, built of red brick with brightly stained timber details that included distinctively overscaled downpipes, balconies, and seating. He also designed private housing for Bovis in Newmarket and Milton Keynes, and for the builders Stanley Miller at Killingworth. The latter led him to be recommended for rebuilding Byker, an area of Newcastle already partly demolished for a motorway scheme, where a new Conservative administration was looking for an alternative to large slab blocks. Byker shines out among British public housing of this period for the intimacy of its detailing and landscaping in a massive scheme of 2000 units, and it was the most completely realized and intricate of all Erskine's housing designs. Built piecemeal over a decade, 1969&#150;80, Byker was a model of early public consultation with the eventual tenants following the 1969 Skeffington report, Erskine opening an office and &#145;drop-in&#146; centre in a former undertaker's shop within the redevelopment. The Byker wall was a snake of multi-coloured brickwork and blue roofs across the north of the site, with tiny windows facing the projected motorway to the north, while the south wall was a riot of fenestration and balconies. The low-rise housing in its lee featured children's playgrounds, and more timber decoration&#151;or what the critic Reyner Banham termed &#145;a tidal wave of sheddery and pergolation&#146;  (Banham, 330). Fragments of demolished Newcastle buildings were also incorporated in the landscape.<br>
<br>From the late 1970s Erskine designed a prodigious number of buildings, increasingly using practices set up by former assistants to realize the working drawings. Housing included Myrstuguberget outside Stockholm (1977&#150;80), on the Byker model to give shelter from a motorway. At Eker&ouml;, near Drottningholm (1985&#150;90), he realized a new town centre, with modestly scaled housing, shops, and community facilities; this was his personal favourite among his designs. He worked extensively at Stockholm University's Frescati campus, including its library, student centre, and sports hall (1974&#150;81), and the Aula Magna (great hall) (1997). In 1984 he received the Wolf Foundation prize for art, using the prize money to found a scholarship for young architects, and in 1987 he won the royal gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<br>
<br>Erskine's most adventurous late projects were a pair of offices for the building firm Skanska; Lilla Bommen in G&ouml;teborg (1987&#150;90), a twenty-two-storey landmark whose bright colours were derived from the ships in the surrounding harbour; and The Ark (1988&#150;91), an atrium building tucked between a gyratory and the underground in Hammersmith, London. The atrium was filled with distinct spaces&#151;pods or shelves for up to four firms on each floor, with different stairs and lifts or access across flying bridges. Erskine explained that &#145;in a liberal democratic society you have concern for those not at the top &hellip; as those at the top can look after themselves&#146;  (BL NSA, interview, 23 Jan 1997). Among his last designs was the initial part of the Millennium Village in Greenwich, won in competition in 1998: another wall of flats to give protection from north winds, it was completed in 2007 by Tovatt architects. Erskine died on 16 March 2005 in Drottningholm, and was survived by his son and two daughters.<br>
