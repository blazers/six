<span class="headword">Browne,  Felicia Mary</span>  (1904&#150;1936), <span class="occ">artist and political activist</span>, was born at The Elms, Weston Green, Thames Ditton, Surrey, on 18 February 1904, the third daughter and the fourth of five children of Harold Browne (1875&#150;1924), company director, who worked in his family's advertising agency, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnston (1875&#150;1931), an actress. After attending the Kingsley School and the St John's Wood School of Art, she took courses at the Slade School of Fine Art in London between the sessions of 1920&#150;21 and 1927&#150;8, and was awarded the certificate in drawing. She travelled to Berlin in 1928 where she learnt to work in stone and metal and witnessed the rise of Nazism. In 1933, following her return to Britain, she joined the Holborn branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain. She also became involved with the Artists International Association, an influential organization of anti-fascist British artists of which her close friend Elizabeth Watson was the secretary. Until 1936 Browne worked quietly in her studios in Billericay and Bloomsbury and travelled extensively in central Europe (having already visited the USSR in 1931).<br>
<br>In July 1936 Browne embarked on a driving holiday to France and Spain, accompanied by her friend Dr Edith Bone, a left-wing photographer. Their objective was to reach Barcelona in time for the People's Olympiad (the socialist riposte to the Olympic games in Hitler's Berlin). However, they arrived shortly before the military rebellion against the Spanish republic that heralded the start of the Spanish Civil War (1936&#150;9), and were immediately caught up in the violence that engulfed Barcelona on 19 July 1936. Browne was then left to her own devices by Bone, who began to collaborate closely with the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> correspondent Claud Cockburn. Determined to stay in Spain, Browne dabbled in journalism and applied unsuccessfully to join both the republican militia and Socorro Rojo (Red Aid). Eventually, on 3 August, she was allowed to join the militia and was sent to Tardienta on the Aragon front. The date of her death in a minor skirmish is uncertain: hardly surprising given the remoteness of the location and the difficulty of communications. The most widely cited date is 25 August 1936, although the only eye-witness account (by her fellow volunteer Georges Brinkman) states 22 August. According to Brinkman, Browne had joined a small raiding party that was intending to blow up a rebel munitions train. The party was itself ambushed and Browne was shot dead while assisting an injured Italian comrade. The exact location of the skirmish, and what happened to her body, are currently unknown.<br>
<br>Although her work was little known in her lifetime, Felicia Browne gained posthumous fame as the only British woman to play a combatant role, and one of the first of more than 500 British volunteers to die, in the Spanish Civil War. In October 1936 an exhibition of her drawings was organized by the Artists International Association in London. Although primarily intended to raise funds for the republican cause, the exhibition also provided the opportunity for an assessment of her talent and ability as an artist. Among many appreciative comments was one by the artist Duncan Grant, who wrote that she had been &#145;gradually extracting from her drawing a wonderfully flexible and personal language&#146;  (Buchanan, 196). Her sketches of the doomed men and women of the Spanish militia made a profound impression on her contemporaries, and have since been regularly reproduced to illustrate books on the Spanish Civil War. Owing to the nature of her death, Browne has come to epitomize the difficult choices facing all politically conscious artists in responding to the depression and the rise of fascism. In this vein, part of a letter that she wrote to a friend before her departure for Spain has often been quoted as evidence that she sacrificed her artistic career to politics: &#145;If painting and sculpture were more valid and urgent to me than the earthquake which is happening in the revolution &hellip; I should paint and make sculpture&#146;  (ibid., 187). However, for all the earnestness of her political beliefs, it should be noted that her service in the militia was something that became possible only when other options closed. Moreover, while in Spain she continued to sketch, producing some of her most striking work, and her final letter from the militia suggests that she was gaining fresh artistic inspiration from the Spanish landscape  (ibid., 198).<br>
<br>A male contemporary at the Slade described Felicia Browne as &#145;a great talker&#146; and as &#145;a rather plain dumpy young woman in horn-rimmed spectacles and a black hat&#146;  (Buchanan, 182). She was an intense and private person, with a lively sense of humour, and was described by a friend as &#145;painfully truthful and honest &hellip; socially much too gracious to belong credibly to the twentieth century&#146;  (&#145;An appreciation&#146;). Like many middle-class radicals of her generation she sought to identify herself with the lives of ordinary working people in both Britain and Europe. (Indeed, shortly before her death she worked in a tea-room and attempted to unionize the staff.) Her political views were outspoken and deeply felt, if at times rather na&iuml;ve. Felicia Browne's artistic career was sadly unfulfilled as, apart from the collection of her sketches published after her death, none of her work has survived in the public domain.<br>
