<span class="headword">Cornwallis,  Anne</span>, countess of Argyll  (<em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic benefactor and supposed author</span>, was the daughter of Sir William Cornwallis (<i>c</i>.1551&#150;1611) of Brome, Suffolk, and his wife, Lucy, daughter of John Neville, fourth Baron Latimer (<i>d</i>. 1577); the essayist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6345/', "Sir William Cornwallis (c.1579&#150;1614)")</script> was her cousin. After the death of Lucy Cornwallis, Anne's father married Jane (<i>c</i>.1581&#150;1659), daughter of Hercules Meautys of West Ham, Essex, and Philippa Cook of Gidea Hall, Essex. No details of Anne's upbringing and early life are known, but she came to the notice of literary historians because the short anthology of sixteenth-century poetry known as the Cornwallis&#150;Lysons manuscript, now in the Folger Library (Folger MS V.a.89), bears on its second page the signature, in a large, rather immature italic hand, &#145;Anne Cornwaleys her booke&#146;. Samuel Lysons, the late eighteenth-century antiquary, was a subsequent owner. Beginning with seven verses by John Bentley, the anthology moves on to twenty-seven more poems, including some by Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford, and one which is attributed to Shakespeare: &#145;When that thyne eyes hathe chose the dame&#146;.<br>
<br>It was James Orchard Halliwell-Phillips, the prolific nineteenth-century Shakespeare scholar and collector, who identified &#145;Anne Cornwaleys&#146; as Sir William's daughter. Convinced that several of the poems were by Shakespeare, he saw the anthology as an intriguing link between Shakespeare and Oxford, and he set about investigating the circumstances in which the poems had been copied. He discovered that, probably in the autumn of 1588, Anne's father had purchased from Oxford, his friend and distant relative, the London house named Fisher's Folly. An enormous mansion set in extensive gardens just east of Bishopgate Street Without, on the site of the present Devonshire Square, it had served as a centre for the many poets and dramatists patronized by Oxford, until his precarious finances forced him to dispose of it to Sir William. Presumably the poems in the anthology had been found in manuscript in Fisher's Folly after Sir William and his daughter moved in, and scholars assumed that Anne had actually copied the contents herself.<br>
<br>Apparently on this basis, the editor of the <span class="italic">Complete Peerage</span> declared that &#145;she was distinguished as an authoress of some note&#146;. In fact, the verses were transcribed in an accomplished secretary hand by someone now believed to have been a professional scribe. Most are love poems, and it is probable that, rather than being copied by a scholarly young woman with literary tastes, they were simply chosen to please a romantic adolescent and presented to Anne by a friend or relative. Her signature in the volume cannot therefore be taken as such important evidence of women's involvement in the transmission of literary manuscripts as has sometimes been supposed.<br>
<br>Anne's true significance lies elsewhere. On 30 November 1609 she made a prestigious marriage when, at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, she became the wife of the widowed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4471/', "Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll (1575/6&#150;1638)")</script>, one of the Scottish nobles who had come south with James VI and I in 1603. It was an unequal match, he being of much higher status, but no doubt she brought her bridegroom a substantial dowry, all the more welcome because he was constantly being pursued by importunate creditors. There was presumably also a dynastic motive, because his first wife had left him with only one son, along with six daughters. He and his new countess went on to have three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Anne was a devout Roman Catholic and her influence became evident when, in 1618, the earl shocked his presbyterian friends and relatives by converting to Catholicism. He and Anne moved to the Spanish Netherlands, where he entered the king of Spain's service. They formed close connections with the Jesuits and all but one of their daughters eventually became nuns. In 1627 Argyll decided to return to London again, to live in retirement. He and Anne took a house in Drury Lane and it was there that she died on 12 January 1635, two days after making a will leaving most of her estate to her daughter Mary and &pound;100 sterling &#145;for pious purposes&#146;, to be distributed at the discretion of Dame Katherine Knollys, wife of Sir Francis Knollys, and Thomas Dade. Dade, who also received an annuity, was possibly the Father Thomas Middleton, alias Dade, who, as Dominican provincial in England, was brought to trial in 1651. Countess Anne was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 13 January 1635.<br>
