<span class="headword">Throckmorton <span class="st"> [Throgmorton]</span>, Sir  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1489&#150;1552), <span class="occ">member of parliament</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63916/', "Sir Robert Throgmorton or Throckmorton (c.1451&#150;1518)")</script>, a landowner of Coughton, Warwickshire, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of William Marrow or Marrowe of London. He had at least two other brothers, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27393/', "Michael Throckmorton")</script>, agent for Cardinal Reginald Pole, and at least one sister, Ursula. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 1 May 1505, and by 1512 had married Katherine, daughter of Nicholas Vaux, first Baron Vaux of Harrowden, a soldier, councillor, and courtier, whose family connection to the Parrs was of subsequent advantage to his children. In 1518 Throckmorton's father, one of Henry VII's courtiers, died on his way to the Holy Land, and George succeeded to a considerable estate, which he further enlarged during his lifetime.<br>
<br>Throckmorton first attracted attention at court in the 1520s when he was in conflict with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey over land. The cardinal, engaged at the time in a campaign against enclosures, in July 1524 ordered Throckmorton to be bound in &pound;100 to appear before the council to be fined, probably for ignoring Wolsey's policy. Nothing further ensued, however, and the next year the two men traded lands, perhaps to facilitate Wolsey's plans for dissolving several small monasteries. An apparent connection developed which allowed Throckmorton to ask Wolsey for favours and for the cardinal to use Throckmorton to resolve local disputes on behalf of the crown. Although he was active in the local government of Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and, more briefly, Buckinghamshire, Throckmorton's chief claim to fame is as an active member of the conservative political faction in the 1530s. Sitting in the Reformation Parliament as knight of the shire for Warwickshire, Throckmorton, a staunch Catholic, constantly fought against Henry VIII's divorce from Katherine of Aragon, the royal supremacy, and all efforts to reform the church. During the critical year, 1532, Throckmorton visited and plotted with men from all the conservative constituencies. After one speech in the House of Commons, he was summoned before the king himself. There he warned Henry that his conscience would be greatly troubled if he married Anne Boleyn, &#145;for that it is thought that ye have meddled with both the mother and the sister&#146;. Taken aback, Henry replied weakly that he had not had carnal relations with Anne's mother, and Thomas Cromwell, who was present, firmly interposed that the King had not had relations with the sister either.<br>
<br>Committed to the papal supremacy and dedicated to fighting against legislation directed against clerical liberties, Throckmorton enmeshed himself in factional politics. He met several other conservative country gentlemen in the Queen's Head tavern in Fleet Street to discuss parliamentary affairs. Cromwell regarded them with some anxiety, and in 1533 he made Throckmorton promise that he would &#145;stay at home and meddle little with politics&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 453).<br>
<br>Late in 1536, however, Throckmorton was arrested for showing an unwise interest in the grievances of the northern rebels. He was questioned about his earlier activities, and told his interrogators that he had been encouraged in his attack on royal policies by several leading members of the conservative faction. William Peto from the house of Franciscan Observants in Greenwich encouraged Throckmorton to oppose the <span class="roman">Act for the Submission of the Clergy</span>, and he had several meetings with John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, who gave him a pamphlet on papal primacy and recommended him to Nicholas Wilson, formerly the king's confessor but lately a bulwark of Katherine of Aragon's cause. Finally, Throckmorton travelled to Syon and absorbed the counsel of Richard Reynolds, who insisted that he continue to speak in parliament against reform legislation even if it did no good. Throckmorton also claimed that Sir Thomas More had once sent for him and promised that if he continued &#145;in the same way&#146; and was not afraid, he would &#145;deserve great reward from God&#146;. Soon released, Throckmorton was in trouble again in 1537 because his younger brother, Michael, who had been sent to spy on Cardinal Pole, instead became his loyal servant. Sir George was taken into custody and held for several weeks. He confessed that he had been blinded by the &#145;sayings and counsels of men who had led him astray&#146;, and begged for forgiveness. By the end of the year his release was assured.<br>
<br>The fall of Thomas Cromwell in 1540 improved Throckmorton's position, though there is no evidence that he played a significant role in these events. The change in the religious climate did prove beneficial to Throckmorton and his conservative associates. He apparently returned his full attention to acquiring additional lands and consolidating his holdings, and in 1542 he married for a second time. He was able to see his family of eight sons and eleven daughters well established. His sons shared their father's resolute frame of mind, but not necessarily his commitment to conservative doctrine. Some, including the eldest, Robert (<i>c</i>.1513&#150;1581), were famous for recusancy, while others, like Clement (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1573), his third son, were convinced puritans. His fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27394/', "Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (1515/16&#150;1571)")</script>, a diplomat and MP, was indicted and acquitted of treason in 1554. George (<i>fl</i>. 1523&#150;1573) was a courtier; Kenelm (<i>c</i>.1514&#150;1583&times;7) an MP; John (<i>c</i>.1524&#150;1580), Throckmorton's seventh son, was an administrator; and his eighth son, Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1587), who married a wealthy widow of Chastleton, Gloucestershire, is sometimes confused with the MP and mercer (<i>d</i>. 1592/3) of the same name. Clement's son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27391/', "Job Throckmorton (1545&#150;1601)")</script>, a politician and religious pamphleteer. Throckmorton and his father were enthusiastic builders, who erected an impressive stone gatehouse at Coughton, with polygonal turrets, large windows, and a battlemented skyline. However, Sir George's plan of making the remainder of the timber-framed house &#145;suitable&#146; to the gatehouse was not fulfilled. He died on 6 August 1552 and was buried in the impressive marble tomb he had had erected for himself in the church at Coughton.<br>
