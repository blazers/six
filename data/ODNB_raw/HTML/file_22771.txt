<span class="headword">Price,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born, according to his own account, in London, but he was later taunted with being a Welshman by one of his congregation, so his family may have come from the principality. His publications reveal that he was educated at Cambridge University and that he gained a BD, but it is not clear if he was either the William Price born in London who was admitted to Sidney Sussex College in 1617, or the namesake who was admitted to Emmanuel College on 28 June 1622, matriculated in 1623, and graduated BA early in 1626. It is possible that it was he who was instituted vicar of Brigstock, Northamptonshire, on 4 January 1633 and who published, as William Price BD, <span class="italic">Janitor animae: the Soules Porter to Cast out Sinne</span> (1638), dedicated to William Cecil, earl of Salisbury, and his wife from their &#145;devouted orator and chaplaine&#146;; this man was still resident in Brigstock in 1639, but by 1641 had been replaced as vicar by one Francis Lewis. It is more certain that at some time in or before 1640 William Price (<i>d</i>. 1666) married Sybella Geens of London and they had a son, John.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1642 Price, as &#145;preacher at Covent Garden&#146;, delivered before the lord mayor and civic leaders <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at St Maries Spittle</span>, published later that year. He was still at Covent Garden when appointed in 1643 to the Westminster assembly, where he spoke often and always supported the presbyterian position, although he opposed the solemn league and covenant. By the time he published <span class="italic">Mans Delinquencie Attended by Divine Justice Intermixt with Mercy</span> (1646), a fast sermon delivered to the House of Lords, he was pastor of Waltham Abbey. However, as the revolution gathered speed, he became alarmed about religious radicalism and Oliver Cromwell.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1648 the English Reformed church of Amsterdam called Price to serve as co-pastor with Richard Maden; formal induction was on 12 August 1648. Price approved of this church's presbyterial polity, and he supported the larger Dutch Reformed system by joining the Amsterdam classis. He was an active co-pastor but his effectiveness was hampered by family problems. His wife stayed behind in London for over two years, claiming illness and weakness, and this prolonged separation of husband and wife was scandalous. Moreover, Price's own ministerial work was intermittent because of illnesses. On the other hand he translated into English the shorter Dutch catechism, published two Latin works, <span class="italic">Triumphans sapientiae</span> (1655) and <span class="italic">Ars conciandi</span> (1657), dedicated respectively to the rulers of Amsterdam and to the University of Cambridge, and was resolute in agitating about political affairs. Price and Maden filled the church with one-sided royalist, anti-Cromwell prayers and sermons. English agents put Price on a list of &#145;violent incendiaryes&#146;  (Thurloe, 2.373&#150;4).<br>
<br>Price's active service in the Amsterdam church ended in 1659, but the following year he published, as from there, <span class="italic">Gods Working and Brittains Wonder</span>, expressing his &#145;unspeakable joy&#146; at the Restoration; he remained on the list of pastors until his death in Amsterdam in July 1666. He was survived by his wife, who was buried at the New Church of Amsterdam on 29 July 1687. His son John had become preacher of the English church at The Hague on 22 May 1661.<br>
