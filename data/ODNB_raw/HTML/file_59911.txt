<span class="headword">Greg,  Samuel</span>  (1758&#150;1834), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer</span>, was born on 26 March 1758 in Belfast, the second surviving son of Thomas Greg, a wealthy Belfast merchant and shipowner, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Hyde, a Lancashire merchant and landowner. In 1766, at the age of eight, he went to live with his childless uncle Robert Hyde of Ardwick Hall, near Manchester. Robert Hyde, a substantial Manchester linen merchant in partnership with his brother Nathaniel, was trading with both Europe and the American colonies, and to secure succession in the business, he effectively adopted Samuel. Samuel Greg completed his formal education at Harrow School under Dr Parr; in 1778 he began learning the textile trade at Hyde &amp; Co., becoming a partner in the firm in 1780. Robert Hyde died in 1782 and, since his uncle Nathaniel was by then a confirmed alcoholic, Samuel Greg inherited the firm. As heir to &pound;10,000 from Robert Hyde and to the stock and goodwill of one of Manchester's largest merchant manufacturers, he became a wealthy young man. On 3 November 1789 he married Hannah (1766&#150;1828), third daughter of Adam Lightbody, a prominent Liverpool merchant, and his wife Elizabeth. They had six boys and seven girls, though one son died as a child; one daughter, Ellen Maria (1807&#150;1894), was the mother of the liberal politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55914/', "George Melly")</script>. They lived first at 35 King Street, Manchester, retaining it as a town house for a number of years. In 1796 Greg built Quarry Bank House adjacent to his cotton mill at Styal near Wilmslow in Cheshire. Raised in a Scottish Presbyterian family, Greg married into a prominent Unitarian family. His children were brought up as Unitarian, but his own religious affiliation remains uncertain. However, he became part of the &#145;charmed circle&#146; of nonconformist families which dominated Manchester's commerce and society in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and he was a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.<br>
<br>Greg was one of the pioneers of the industrial revolution, and his achievements were entirely as a cotton factory owner and a merchant. His first cotton-spinning mill, Quarry Bank Mill, began operation in 1784, and was the foundation of what became, by his retirement in 1832, the largest coarse spinning and weaving concern in the country. The firm grew slowly during the Napoleonic wars, allowing Greg to divert some of his wealth into a small estate in Styal and land at Reddish, near Stockport in Cheshire, adding to real estate he owned in Manchester, North America, and the West Indies. However, to secure his sons' futures, he built or purchased four other cotton mills during the 1820s&#151;at Caton near Lancaster, Lancaster, Bury, and Bollington, near Macclesfield. At the same time he expanded spinning capacity at Quarry Bank and undertook extensive community development in the adjacent village of Styal. Unlike his son <a href="#cosubject_11445">Samuel [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Greg was not a philanthropist, but viewed his factory colony as an essential adjunct to rural factory ownership. However, his labour policies and some of the institutions that developed in the village, such as the Female Society, reflected the strong influence of his free-thinking wife Hannah. Her interest in religion and education also had a lasting impact on her younger sons, especially Samuel, and William, and she provided a calming influence on the increasingly difficult relationship between Greg and his sons. After Hannah's death, on 4 February 1828, Greg remained in good health until 1832 when, at seventy-four, he was attacked by a tame stag in the grounds of Quarry Bank House and his injuries forced his retirement. His four younger sons, Robert, John, Samuel, and William Rathbone Greg, took control of Samuel Greg &amp; Co., with Robert becoming the senior partner. Greg never fully recovered from his accident and died at Quarry Bank House on 4 June 1834.<br>
<br>The fourth surviving son, <a name="cosubject_11445"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Greg</span>  (1804&#150;1876), <span class="occ">mill owner and philanthropist</span>, was born on 6 September 1804 at Quarry Bank House, Styal. From 1811 to 1819 he attended the Unitarian school of the Revd J. J. Taylor of Nottingham, followed by two years at Dr Lant Carpenter's school in Bristol. His years at Bristol were to have a profound effect on him since it was during this time that his scientific and literary tastes were formed. Two years spent gaining experience in the family business were followed, in 1823, by a winter of study at the University of Edinburgh. He became a partner in Samuel Greg &amp; Co. in 1827 and, like his brothers, travelled in Europe prior to starting full-time work. On his father's retirement in 1832 he became responsible for Lowerhouse Mill at Bollington. He married Mary Priscilla Needham of Lenton, near Nottingham, in June 1838 and they had six girls and two boys, one of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Unlike his father and elder brother Robert, for whom business success was a driving force, the younger Samuel Greg saw mill ownership as an opportunity for social experiment. Passionately committed to improving the educational opportunities of working people, in 1830 and 1831 he gave a series of scientific lectures to his father's workers at Styal. His move to Bollington gave him ample opportunities for more wide-ranging social experimentation and the creation of a model village. He outlined his plans and objectives for his community in <span class="italic">Two Letters to Leonard Horner on the Capabilities of the Factory System</span> (1840). He established a Sunday school, a gymnasium, drawing and singing classes, baths and libraries, and founded the order of the Silver Cross in 1836 as a reward for good conduct for young women. In 1847 he introduced new machinery for stretching cloth, a move which proved so unpopular that his workforce came out on strike, devastating him and precipitating a nervous breakdown. This led him to retire from business, though he continued to live at The Mount, Bollington. His philanthropic interests were transferred to Macclesfield, where, in the 1850s and 1860s, he gave evening classes and scientific lectures to working people and became president of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. He died at The Mount on 14 May 1876, after a long illness, survived by his wife. Prefaced by a brief memoir by Dean Stanley, <span class="italic">A Layman's Legacy</span> (1877), which contains a selection of his writing, was published to celebrate his life.<br>
