<span class="headword">Thomas,  Richard</span>  (1837&#150;1916), <span class="occ">tin plate manufacturer</span>, was born at Bridgwater, Somerset, on 5 December 1837, the son of Richard Thomas, shipowner and merchant, of Bridgwater. He was educated at Wesleyan (now Queen's) College, Taunton, until the age of eleven. During his early working life he was employed as a clerk, as an assistant to an uncle who ran a draper's business in Oxford (later becoming a partner in the business), and as a coal exporter and commission agent in Cardiff.<br>
<br>While in Cardiff Thomas married, on 18 February 1859, Anne Loveluck (1836/7&#150;1914), daughter of John Loveluck, a farmer, of Ffald, Llangynog; they had five sons and a daughter. His subsequent employment as works manager and accountant of a colliery and firebrick business at Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, in which his father was a partner, was to provide a springboard for his future career. In 1863 his appointment as accountant and sub-manager in charge of overseeing the construction of a new iron plate and tin plate works at Melyn, Neath, Glamorgan, brought him into direct contact for the first time with the industry in which he was to become an important figure. During his four years at Melyn he studied the processes, working methods, and ways of financing the tin plate trade, and he made contacts with important ironmasters and coal owners.<br>
<br>A spell as general manager and secretary at the Ynyspenllwch ironworks was followed by Thomas's most significant development: the formation of Richard Thomas &amp; Co. to acquire and run the idle Lydbrook tin plate works in Gloucestershire in 1871. Expansion through the acquisition of the Lydney works (1875) and the Lydbrook colliery (1877) led, however, to financial difficulties and, in 1883, eventual liquidation, due mainly to problems of flooding at the colliery. Nevertheless, with the backing of the company's major creditor, the Barrow Hematite Steel Company, the business was relaunched in 1884 as Richard Thomas &amp; Co. Ltd, with Thomas as managing director of the new concern and his eldest son, Richard Beaumont Thomas, as general manager.<br>
<br>Gradually the tin plate interests of Thomas and his sons&#151;for he was always concerned to provide jobs for members of his family&#151;were extended. In 1888 he acquired, in conjunction with William Thomas Lewis (later Baron Senghenydd) and others, the Melingriffith tin plate works on the outskirts of Cardiff. This and future expansion was based on Thomas's ability to identify ailing concerns which could be acquired at a low price and turned into profitable businesses. The period following the introduction of the American tariffs on tin plate in the early 1890s provided an impetus for further acquisitions in the late 1890s and enabled the Thomas family to build up control over a significant portion of the British tin plate industry. By 1916 the various companies associated with Richard Thomas &amp; Co. Ltd employed over 11,000 workers and controlled a quarter of the tin plate mills in south Wales. While the problems faced during the inter-war period by the organization he built up may cast some doubts on the strategy he pursued and the organizational structure he established, the growth of the Thomas empire was none the less a considerable feat of entrepreneurship and a testament to his considerable drive and energy.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that the key to Thomas's success lay &#145;in his concentration of purpose, epitomised perhaps by his insistence on total attention to business&#146;  (Wainwright, 55). Indeed, he spared little time for public life, spending only a brief period on the Monmouth board of guardians. A modest and quiet-living man who shunned publicity, he nevertheless gave generously to many a deserving cause, particularly favouring hospital work.<br>
<br>Thomas died on 28 September 1916 at 31 Henrietta Street, Bath, and was buried at Lydbrook churchyard, Gloucestershire, on 30 September. His wife had predeceased him, dying in 1914.<br>
