<span class="headword">Cash,  John Theodore</span>  (1854&#150;1936), <span class="occ">physician and pharmacologist</span>, was born at Manchester on 16 December 1854, the younger son of John Walker Cash, who retired from business and took up farming near Leeds, and his wife, Martha Midgley. He was educated at Bootham School, York, and the Edinburgh collegiate school, and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MB CM, and qualified MRCS (England), in 1876, and gained a gold medal for his MD thesis in 1879. In 1881 he married (Margaret) Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1924), daughter of the statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3421/', "John Bright")</script>; the couple had two sons and two daughters. Sophia Cash was an accomplished artist and painted the beautiful watercolours used to illustrate her husband's lectures on materia medica.<br>
<br>After graduation Cash studied the methods of pharmacological research in Berlin, Vienna, and Paris. He was then house physician at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, but returned to Berlin and afterwards moved to Leipzig, where he worked with the celebrated physiologist Carl Ludwig. On arriving in London he began researches with T. L. Brunton at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and from 1880 to 1884 published many valuable pharmacological papers which were representative of a new and accurate scientific approach to the elucidation of the actions of drugs. His elaborate and precise researches upon the various alkaloids of aconitum, begun prior to 1886, paved the way for his pioneer endeavours, by researches on the substituted ammonias and benzene compounds, to lay the foundations of a relationship between chemical constitution and pharmacological action; this investigation, published jointly with Brunton in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> in 1884, indicated to synthetic chemists paths towards the discovery of new remedies. In the years that followed he made other communications to the Royal Society on this subject.<br>
<br>The high scientific standard of Cash's researches led to his appointment to the regius chair of materia medica and therapeutics in Aberdeen University in 1886 and to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in the following year. He was a skilled experimentalist, ingenious in devising recording apparatus, and imbued with the axiom that in order to obtain true results the least disturbance of the tissues was of paramount importance. His gracious manner and cultured language as a lecturer inspired honourable work by his students and his scientific example encouraged Arthur Robertson Cushny to adopt pharmacology as his life work.<br>
<br>Cash was dean of the faculty of medicine at Aberdeen University and from 1911 to 1919 a member of the General Medical Council when he took a large share in editing the <span class="italic">British Pharmacop&#339;ia</span> of 1914. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Cash's chief recreation was a passionate devotion to salmon and trout fishing: he was an expert on the pathology of diseases of the salmon, and a particular salmon fly bears his name. The opening of the salmon fishing season could always be dated by his disappearance from the laboratory after months of continuous research. He retired from his chair in 1919 and settled at Hereford where, on the Wye, he enjoyed his favourite pastime but continued to be keenly interested in pharmacological researches. Cash died at his home, Albyn House, Broomy Hill, Hereford, on 30 November 1936 and was buried at Hereford.<br>
