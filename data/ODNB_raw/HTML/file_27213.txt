<span class="headword">Thomas,  David</span>  (1813&#150;1894), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born at one of two neighbouring farms, Vatson North or Vatson South, in the parish of East Williamston, near Saundersfoot. He was one of the ten children of William Thomas (1782&#150;1855), founder and first minister of Sardis Congregational Church, Saundersfoot. William Thomas married the elder of the two daughters of Clement Phillips of Carn Mill, in the parish of Begelly. David Thomas embarked on a career in business at Tenby, but his abilities as a lay preacher in his father's church so impressed Nun Morgan Harry and Caleb Morris, two London ministers whose roots were in Pembrokeshire, that they persuaded him to devote himself to the nonconformist ministry. Although he was already married and had a son, he became a student at Newport Pagnell Academy in 1839. He was ordained at Chesham Congregational Church in 1841 and moved to Stockwell Green Chapel, London, in 1845. He ministered there until his retirement in 1877.<br>
<br>Thomas's vigorous ministry typifies the intensifying of nonconformist activism in the mid-Victorian period. He founded a working men's club and institute in 1862 and launched an insurance plan for the widows of ministers. He supported such causes as total abstinence and the abolition of the death penalty. He showed his interest in popular journalism as chairman of the National Newspaper League Company and launched <span class="italic">The Dial</span> newspaper on 7 January 1860. It merged with the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span> in June 1864. The freshness of his preaching and his personal charm attracted large congregations, especially from among the professional classes. He sought to improve the quality of public worship by publishing <span class="italic">A Biblical Liturgy</span> in 1855. Each of its twenty services had a theological theme and was composed of a mosaic of biblical quotations. With the same intention he published in 1866 <span class="italic">The Augustine Hymn Book</span>. Among attenders at his services was Catherine Mumford, at whose marriage to William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army, Thomas officiated. As a child Wilson Carlile, founder of the Church Army, also attended Thomas's church, where his parents were members.<br>
<br>Thomas was a prolific author, publishing during his career some fifty titles. He became a familiar name as the editor of <span class="italic">The Homilist</span>, which first appeared in March 1852 and ran eventually to fifty volumes. It contained sermons, hundreds of which were composed by the editor, together with items on moral and religious topics and expositions of biblical passages. Thomas explained that it was intended &#145;not to supply sermons for indolent and incompetent preachers, but stimulus and tonic for the true-hearted, hard-working and genuine teacher&#146;  (<span class="italic">Septem in uno</span>, 1886, foreword). For some time before he retired from the editorship in 1881 he had been helped by his son, Urijah. The journal had a very wide readership in both Britain and America.<br>
<br>Thomas's books were also much appreciated in both countries for presenting a catholic and comprehensive view of religious truth without being disloyal to the evangelical tradition. This appraisal was justified not only by his biblical commentaries but also by such works as <span class="italic">The Crisis of Being</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">The Progress of Being</span> (1854). On the other hand <span class="italic">The Practical Philosopher: a Daily Monitor for the Business Men of England</span> (1873) exemplifies his constant anxiety to relate his convictions to the contemporary concerns of the secular world. His complete works were published under the title <span class="italic">The Homilistic Library</span> (9 vols., 1882&#150;9).<br>
<br>On 30 September 1837 Thomas married Elinor, the younger daughter of David Rees JP, a landowner and shipowner, at St Peter's Church, Carmarthen. She died on 9 February 1874, aged sixty-four. They had two sons and four daughters, in order of seniority: Urijah, David, Sissie, Sidney, Ellen, and Angelene. Urijah Rees Thomas (1839&#150;1901) became the minister of Redland Congregational Church, Bristol; David Morgan Thomas JP became a barrister and founded the <span class="italic">Cambrian Daily Leader</span> (1861&#150;1923), the first daily newspaper in Wales. It was published at Cardiff, as was his other newspaper, the <span class="italic">Cardiff Morning Express</span>. David Thomas died at 3 Victoria Terrace, Ramsgate, on 30 December 1894, and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
