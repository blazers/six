<span class="headword">Hepburn,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1723), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of Major James Hepburn of Balnageith, Moray. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, graduating as master of arts in 1669. Hepburn became a preacher to presbyterian dissidents in Scotland, being ordained by exiled Scots ministers in London in 1678. After working in Ross-shire, in 1680 he was called to become preacher to the parish of Urr, Kirkcudbrightshire, though he continued also to preach widely in both the north and the south-west. His arrest was ordered in 1680, and in 1683 he was captured in London and sent back to Scotland for trial.<br>
<br>After the restoration of presbyterianism in 1690 he was accepted as parish minister of Urr by the church, though with reluctance as he was strongly influenced by the &#145;society people&#146;, the presbyterian groups who refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Church of Scotland through its abandonment of the covenants. Hepburn combined his work as parish minister with encouraging the formation of prayer societies among his supporters, avoiding giving either wholehearted recognition to the Church of Scotland, or rejecting it completely like the more extreme dissidents of the Cameronian societies. Hepburn was suspended from the ministry in 1696 and, on refusing to take the oath of allegiance, he was briefly imprisoned before being exiled to Brechin.<br>
<br>Hepburn was allowed back to his parish in 1699. By 1700 his first wife, a Leslie from the &#145;North&#146;  (McMillan, 230&#150;31), had died, and on 20 April 1701 he married Emilia, daughter of Alexander Nisbet of Craigentinny in Urr. Although the rest of Hepburn's personal life is obscure, he is known to have had two children. Hepburn was again suspended in 1704, and was deposed on 9 April 1705. Though he fiercely attacked the union of parliaments of 1707 he opposed armed resistance to it, and this may have contributed to the decision to restore him to Urr on 12 August 1707, at the desire of his parishioners.<br>
<br>In 1715 Hepburn, seeing the Jacobite rebels as a greater threat to the truly godly than the existing regime, raised his supporters in arms to oppose them. Though he died on 20 March 1723 the strength of the dissident tradition he and others had established helped to inspire the &#145;Levellers of Galloway&#146;, whose forcible resistance in 1724 to agricultural improvements involving evictions was suppressed by the army. The Hebronites never numbered more than a few thousand people, and most joined the Secession church after 1733.<br>
