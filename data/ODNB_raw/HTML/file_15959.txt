<span class="headword">Lancaster,  Henry Hill</span>  (1829&#150;1875), <span class="occ">essayist and advocate</span>, born on 10 January 1829 at Glasgow, was the son of Thomas Lancaster, a Glasgow merchant, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelly. He was educated first at the high school, Glasgow, and afterwards at Glasgow University. A distinguished student, he proceeded in 1849 as a Snell exhibitioner to Balliol College, Oxford. In 1853 he obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> as well as third class honours in the new school of law and modern history, and in the following year he was awarded the Arnold prize for an essay on &#145;The benefits arising from the union of England and Scotland in the reign of Queen Anne&#146;. He graduated BA in 1853 and MA in 1872. He settled in Edinburgh on leaving Oxford, passed as an advocate there in 1858, and proved himself an able and industrious lawyer. He defended the university in <i>Jex Blake v. the University of Edinburgh</i>, and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in the action brought against that journal by Keith Johnston. In 1862 he married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1836/7), daughter of John Graham of Skelmorlie Castle, Ayrshire, and his wife, Elizabeth; they had at least one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>During Gladstone's first government (1868 to 1874) Lancaster was advocate-depute. He took an active interest in the cause of education. In 1858 he served as secretary to a commission of inquiry into the state of King's and Marischal colleges, Aberdeen; and in 1872 was a member of a royal commission on Scottish educational establishments.<br>
<br>In his leisure Lancaster contributed to the daily Edinburgh press, and in November 1860 he began a connection with the <span class="italic">North British Review</span> with an article on &#145;Lord Macaulay's place in English literature&#146;. He took a strong interest in Scottish political history, and was a contributor on that subject for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. He died suddenly from apoplexy, on 24 December 1875, at 5 Ainslie Place, Edinburgh. In 1876 his more important essays were reprinted privately in two volumes, with a prefatory notice by Benjamin Jowett, and many were published as <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1876). His son, Thomas Harvey Lancaster, was rector of Edinburgh Academy.<br>
