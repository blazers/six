<span class="headword">Myers,  Ernest James</span>  (1844&#150;1921), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was born at Keswick on 13 October 1844, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19688/', "Frederic Myers (1811&#150;1851)")</script>, perpetual curate of St John's, Keswick, and his second wife, Susan Harriet (1811&#150;1896), the youngest daughter of John Marshall of Hallsteads, on Ullswater. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35177/', "Frederic William Henry Myers (1843&#150;1901)")</script>. Ernest Myers, who spent many of his summer holidays in the fell country, retained throughout his life an ardent love for the region.<br>
<br>From Cheltenham College, where he was head of the school, Myers went in 1863 as an exhibitioner to Balliol College, Oxford. He enjoyed college life to the full, rowing in the college eight and playing rackets and tennis. He was also academically successful, obtaining a first class in classical moderations (1865) and the Gaisford prize for Greek verse (1865), but he narrowly missed the Hertford scholarship and a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. In 1868 he was elected a fellow of Wadham College, where he remained for three years as a lecturer. While at Wadham, he wrote and published his first poem, <span class="italic">The Puritans</span> (1869), a short drama intentionally reminiscent of the <span class="italic">Persae</span> of Aeschylus.<br>
<br>From 1871 to 1891 Myers lived in London, where he was called to the bar (1874) but never practised. During these years he published his prose translations of Pindar's <span class="italic">Odes</span> (1874) and of the last eight books of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (with Andrew Lang and Walter Leaf, 1882), as well as some essays in magazines, and one, on Aeschylus, in the collection entitled <span class="italic">Hellenica</span>, edited by Evelyn Abbott (1880). Myers's enthusiasm for Greece was the most striking characteristic of his writing, although he also compiled a selection of prose passages by Milton (<span class="italic">Parchment Series</span>, 1884); a short biography of Viscount Althorp (1890), whose services in connection with the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832 he thought to be insufficiently recognized; and three volumes of verse, <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1877), <span class="italic">The Defence of Rome</span> (1880), and <span class="italic">The Judgement of Prometheus</span> (1886).<br>
<br>Myers's activities during his life in London were not confined to literature. From 1876, for nearly six years, he acted as secretary to the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching. He was on the council of the Hellenic Society from its foundation in 1879. Later, after abandoning the idea of parliamentary life, he worked for the Charity Organization Society, serving on its central administrative committee until he left London.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1883 Myers married Nora Margaret, daughter of Samuel Lodge, rector of Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire; they had two sons and three daughters. In 1891 the family moved to a house at Chislehurst on the edge of Paul's Cray Common, which was to feature in his poem &#145;A Common&#146;, in his <span class="italic">Gathered Poems</span>. Here Myers remained for the rest of his life, abandoning the habit of continental travel to which some of his poems bear witness, but paying a weekly visit to London in order to see friends and to attend the council meetings of the Society for the Protection of Women and Children. Most of the verse composed in these years is included in <span class="italic">Gathered Poems</span> (1904), a collection which also contained what he thought best in the volumes previously published. Myers died of pneumonia at Fontridge, Burwash, Sussex, on 25 November 1921. He was survived by his wife, one son, and two daughters; one daughter had died in infancy, and his elder son was killed while serving in France in 1918.<br>
