<span class="headword">Sterling,  James</span>  (1701&#150;1763), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, the son of James Sterling, a captain in the British army, and Patience Hansard, was born in Downrass, King's county, Ireland. He attended Trinity College, Dublin, from 1716 to 1720. Sterling's poetic drama <span class="italic">The Rival Generals</span> was performed in Dublin and published in three editions in 1722. He married Nancy Lyddell, who acted in the play, and in 1723 the couple travelled to London, where Nancy made her first appearance on 2 October 1723 at Lincoln's Inn Fields as Desdemona. Sterling had three of his poems published in <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1724) edited by Matthew Concannen, and the following year the couple returned to Dublin, where Nancy acted regularly in the Smock Alley Theatre until poor health forced her to give a farewell performance on 22 May 1732 as Polly Peachum in John Gay's <span class="italic">Beggar's Opera</span>.<br>
<br>After Nancy's death Sterling graduated MA from Trinity College in 1733 and took holy orders. He served as chaplain to the king's &#145;own Royal Regiment of Foot&#146;, during which time he published <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of the Rev. James Sterling</span>, volume 1 (1734). Sterling's play <span class="italic">The Parricide</span> was published in 1736 and performed three times at Goodman's Fields (which was then managed by his former wife's brother-in-law Henry Gifford). Sterling received the royal bounty for going abroad as a missionary on 16 September 1737. Precisely two months later he became minister of the parish of All Hallows, Anne Arundel county, Maryland. On 26 August 1739 he accepted the call to St Paul's, Kent county, Maryland, where he lived at Chestertown. Sterling married Rebecca Holt, widow of the Revd Arthur Holt, on 19 September 1743; a daughter, Rebecca, was born on 22 November 1744. Sterling married his third wife, Mary Smith, on 7 September 1749. While in Maryland Sterling produced a number of elegies and other occasional poems (published in local periodicals), including prologues and epilogues for the travelling Hallam Theatre Company. His long poem <span class="italic">An Epistle to the Hon. Arthur Dobbs</span> (1752) was printed in Dublin and London.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1752, while on a visit to London, Sterling and a group of merchants appeared before the lord commissioners of trade seeking a grant for the right of exclusive trade on the Labrador coast. In attempting a monopoly Sterling betrayed the trust of Benjamin Franklin and a group of Philadelphians who were financing an exploratory trip to Labrador. The Board of Trade rejected Sterling's request because of the Hudson Bay Company's rival petition. Sterling also presented a plan to the lords of the Treasury that proposed the creation of a new Maryland customs district. Sterling was appointed to the collectorship on 12 May 1752 at an annual salary of &pound;80. Sterling now decided to return to Maryland and for the second time received the royal bounty for travelling overseas as a missionary. Leaving London early in June 1752 he arrived in Annapolis on 7 August. After an outbreak of fighting on the frontier the governor, Horatio Sharpe, called a special meeting of the Maryland legislature for 13 December 1754 and requested Sterling to deliver a sermon on the occasion. Three hundred copies of <span class="italic">Zeal Against the Enemies of our Country</span> (1755) were printed at the legislature's expense. It was also reprinted in London.<br>
<br>Sterling died in Chestertown on 10 November 1763; his third wife and his daughter, Rebecca, who married William Carmichael (<i>d</i>. 1795), the diplomat and adventurer, survived him. An obituary and an epitaph appeared in the <span class="italic">Maryland Gazette</span> on 17 November.<br>
