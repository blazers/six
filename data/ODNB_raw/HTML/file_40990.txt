<span class="headword">Austin,  Henry</span>  (1811/12&#150;1861), <span class="occ">civil engineer and sanitarian</span>, was the son of William Austin, medical practitioner, of Bloomsbury Square, London. Two sisters and at least one brother survived to adulthood. Austin was a pupil of Robert Stephenson, with whom he worked on the London and Birmingham and London and Blackwall railways. During work on the second project Austin became &#145;deeply impressed with the miserable conditions of the dwellings of the working class suburbs through which the railway was carried, and with the belief that many of the evils he saw could be remedied by sanitary knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 1.21). On 15 July 1837 Austin married Letitia Mary (1816&#150;1893), daughter of John Dickens and sister of Charles Dickens. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>In 1829 and again in 1847 Austin was involved with the expeditions led by Lieutenant Thomas Waghorn (1800&#150;1850) on overland routes to India, and for the later trip he advised on railway routes through the Alps. Having struggled for some years in private practice, Austin became prominent in the movement for sanitary improvement that began in the early 1840s, serving as honorary secretary to the Metropolitan Improvement Society in 1842 and to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95366', "Health of Towns Association")</script> in 1845&#150;7. His success in the latter post led to appointments as secretary to the royal commission on the sanitation of the metropolis in 1847&#150;9 and as secretary to the General Board of Health (GBH) in 1848&#150;52. He was also chief consulting engineer to the first and second commissions on consolidated metropolitan sewers, in 1847&#150;9.<br>
<br>In 1852 Austin resigned the secretaryship of the Board of Health to become a superintending inspector. After the elimination of the board in 1854 he served as chief inspector under the <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span> (until 1858), and under the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> office from 1858 until his death. In addition to his routine inspections of towns and public works projects, Austin was the author of <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Abuses of the Present System of Competition in Architecture</span> (1841), which called for more knowledgeable juries, and of <span class="italic">A Report on the Means of Deodorizing and Utilizing the Sewage of Towns</span> (1857), which led to renewed enthusiasm for sewage recycling by broad irrigation, in the early 1860s.<br>
<br>Though a staunch centralist on matters of local government, Austin was quiet and tactful and able to work well with such difficult and disparate superiors as Edwin Chadwick and Sir Benjamin Hall. He was one of the few people Chadwick trusted and was responsible for checking the claims of the other GBH engineers and often, in practice, for making the decisions about requests by towns for permission to raise loans for public works. Although a staunch proponent of Chadwick's pipe-sewerage theories in the early 1850s, he later admitted that he pushed this unproven technology too far.<br>
<br>Austin had a long and close friendship with Charles Dickens. The two collaborated on numerous projects: amateur theatricals in the early 1830s; <i>expos&eacute;s</i> of sanitary conditions published in Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span> in the early 1850s; many philanthropic projects; and the remodelling of several of Dickens's houses. Austin's intimate knowledge of the profession of architecture and some of his concerns, such as the incompetent administration of architectural competitions, are reflected in Dickens's novel <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> (1843&#150;4). Austin died at his home, The Hollies, Little Ealing, London, on 9 October 1861, of acute laryngitis. On a petition from Dickens, Chadwick, and Lord Shaftesbury, his widow was awarded a small government pension.<br>
