<span class="headword">Bolton,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1735, <em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">natural history artist and mycologist</span>, was baptized on 23 November 1735; he was probably born on a farm in the Calder valley, Yorkshire. He was the younger son of a weaver, William Bolton (or Boulton). His elder brother, Thomas (1722?&#150;1778), was also a competent botanist, and this has frequently given rise to confusion in attributing their respective or joint role in botanical recording. It is not known if James received any formal education; a self-taught artist, he acquired some of his techniques indirectly, or perhaps directly, from Georg Ehret, whom he may well have met through their mutual patron, the duchess of Portland. Bolton was employed in his early adult life as a weaver but later became a respected art teacher, as well as an author and illustrator of works on plants, fungi, and birds; in the late 1790s he became the landlord of a public house in or near Luddenden Foot. In 1768 he married Sarah Blackburn 
    (or Blakeburn; <i>b</i>. 1749)
  , who probably predeceased him; they had three sons, Virgil, Thomas, and John, and probably a daughter, Sally, who died in childhood.<br>
<br>Bolton was one of the foremost eighteenth-century mycologists. His talent as a botanical artist and portrayer of taxonomic detail, and as author of the first British book devoted to fungi, is widely recognized. His role in natural history recording is less widely understood, but his illustrations show his prowess in field observation, and manuscript material exists which shows that he made numerous field records, often noting important ecological details. The published catalogue of plants in John Watson's <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Halifax in Yorkshire</span> (1775), often attributed to him, was in part compiled by his brother Thomas and probably other local naturalists.<br>
<br>Bolton lived for his entire life in the Halifax area, which provided a rich source of material, particularly fungi, for his drawings, but he also travelled and collected in the Craven district of Yorkshire, neighbouring counties, and north Wales. He communicated with key botanists of his day, including Jean Bulliard, James Dickson, John Lightfoot, and Carl Willdenow, but it is not clear if mentions by other important correspondents and visitors to &#145;Bolton&#146; refer to him or to his brother. He was elected an honorary member of the Natural History Society of Edinburgh, and in 1788 the genus <i>Boltonia</i> (Compositae) was named by Charles L'Heritier de Brutelle in his honour.<br>
<br>Bolton is best remembered as the author of three major works, <span class="italic">Filices Britannicae</span> (2 vols., 1785&#150;90), <span class="italic">An History of Fungusses Growing about Halifax</span> (3 vols., 1788&#150;90; supplement, 1791), and <span class="italic">Harmonia ruralis</span> (2 vols., 1794&#150;6), the illustrations to all of which he drew and etched himself. His <span class="italic">History of Fungusses</span> was republished in German in four volumes, with inferior plates, as <span class="italic">Geschichte der Merkw&uuml;rdigsten</span> (1795&#150;1820). He also provided the illustrations for Richard Relhan's <span class="italic">Flora Cantabrigiensis</span> (1785).<br>
<br>Bolton died in Yorkshire on 7 January 1799. His estate (paintings, microscope, printing equipment, and personal effects) was auctioned in the following June.<br>
