<span class="headword">French,  Robert</span>  (1716&#150;1779), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was the eldest son of Patrick French (<i>d</i>. 1744), barrister, and Jane Digby, the daughter of Simon Digby, successively bishop of Limerick and Elphin. The Frenches, of Anglo-Norman origins, had settled originally in the port of Galway, where they were regarded as one of the dominant &#145;tribes&#146;. This branch of the family had acquired lands in the county centred on Monivae. Patrick French became a barrister and conformed to the established church in 1709. Robert, after entering Trinity College, Dublin, in 1734, where he graduated BA in 1737, followed his father into the law. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1736 and to the King's Inns in Dublin in 1742. On inheriting Monivae at his father's death in 1744 he virtually ceased legal practice and devoted himself to the improvement of his patrimony and public affairs. In April 1746 he married Nicola Acheson (<i>d</i>. 1762), the younger daughter of Sir Arthur Acheson, fifth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1749), MP, and Anne Savage, of Market Hill in co. Armagh. He was a JP for co. Galway from 1745, and in 1753 he was elected to parliament for the same county. At first a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of the government manager, Archbishop Stone, he soon adopted an independent stance. In 1761 he transferred to the less prestigious borough seat of Carrick-on-Shannon, and in 1767 he was returned for the city of Galway, which his father had represented between 1713 and 1715. In parliament, while upholding the intimate constitutional link with Great Britain, he criticized the insensitive attempts by British ministers and Irish lords lieutenant to subordinate Ireland and curtail the powers of the Irish parliament. His views were summarized in the ostensibly anonymous pamphlet of 1770 <span class="italic">The Constitution of Ireland</span>. He actively forwarded, both in parliament and his locality, endeavours aimed at material and ethical betterment, himself serving in the Incorporated Society of Dublin and from 1769 on the linen board.<br>
<br>French's Galway estate was praised by Arthur Young as a model of enlightened innovation. He had inherited rentals reduced by the agricultural depressions of the 1740s, and he invested heavily to attract skilled bleachers, weavers, and spinning-masters. As well as enlarging and modernizing his own mansion he rebuilt much of Monivae, adding a protestant church, charter school, and housing for tenants. He put into effect some of what he had noted during an extended trip to England during 1751. A slump in the market for Irish linens in 1773 made him reconsider his strategy. Only in the 1760s had his spending on capital improvements yielded significantly higher rentals, and by the 1770s accumulated debts restricted his activities. He did not seek re-election to parliament in 1774, but encouraged his son-in-law, Sir Lucius O'Brien, to continue his philanthropic and utilitarian interests. After his wife's death in 1762 he conducted an affair with a servant, Winifred Higgins; they had several children. French died in 1779. His eldest son, Acheson French, had predeceased him and so the estate was inherited by Acheson's son, Robert French.<br>
