<span class="headword">Blair,  Robert</span>  (1699&#150;1746), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of the Revd David Blair (<i>d</i>. 1710), minister of the Old Kirk parish in Edinburgh and one of the king's chaplains, and his wife, Euphemia Nisbet, daughter of Alexander Nisbet of Carfin, Lanarkshire. Hugh Blair, who was to become famous as professor of rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i> at the University of Edinburgh, was his first cousin. Robert was educated at the University of Edinburgh and in the Netherlands, though no specific details of his education remain.<br>
<br>From about 1718 to 1731 Blair resided probably in Edinburgh as an unemployed probationer, finally being licensed to preach by the presbytery of Haddington on 5 August 1729. Prior to his only church living as minister in Haddington presbytery at Athelstaneford, Haddingtonshire, to which he was ordained on 5 January 1731, references to Blair are scant. There is an &#145;Epistle to Robert Blair&#146; in a miscellany, <span class="italic">Lugubres cantus</span>, published in Edinburgh in 1719 that provides no biographical detail of its dedicatee. Blair was a member, probably, of the Athenian Society, an Edinburgh literary club whose members included James Thomson, author of <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, who may have been Blair's fellow student at Divinity Hall in Edinburgh. In 1720 the Athenians published a volume of verse, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Miscellany</span>, that includes the early work of Thomson. Some slight pietistic poems in the book signed by B are usually taken to be by Blair. In 1728 Blair published his <span class="italic">Poem Dedicated to the Memory of &hellip; William Law</span>, 138 lines of elegiac verse in the form of a quarto pamphlet on the professor of moral philosophy at Edinburgh, William Law of Elvingston.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1738 Blair married Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1774), the daughter of Professor Law. The couple had five sons, David, William, Francis, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2571/', "Robert Blair (1741&#150;1811)")</script>, who was to become Lord Blair of Avontoun, lord president of the Scottish college of justice from 1808, and a man admired by George III, and Archibald; they also had one daughter, Anna. Blair possessed a private fortune and had long relied on this to give him leisure to pursue his two chief interests, English poetry and botany. At Athelstaneford, Blair seems to have continued a rather solitary life of which, Alexander Carlyle, in his <span class="italic">Anecdotes and Characters of the Times</span>, provides a rather acidic glimpse during 1744,<blockquote>I got away time enough next Day to reach Haddington before Dinner; Having past by Athelstaneford where the Minister Mr Robert Blair Author of The Grave, was said to be Dying Slowly; or at any Rate, was so Austere and void of Urbanity, as to make him quite Disagreeable to young People (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 49)</blockquote>At Athelstaneford, Blair worked slowly on <span class="italic">The Grave</span>, which he had begun while living in Edinburgh. The long genesis of the poem probably resulted from an extreme care not so much born out of perfectionism as out of wariness on the part of Blair, due to a Calvinist cultural climate in Scotland that was only very slowly changing so as to accommodate poetry. The advance of the evangelical revival in Britain in the 1740s licensed the often gloomy, emotional excess that Blair poured into his religious poem and spurred its author to seek publication. In 1742 the poem was finished and Blair sent the manuscript to the great hymnist Dr Isaac Watts, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to interest two London booksellers in publishing it. In 1743 with the help of another English divine, Dr Philip Doddridge, Blair succeeded in having <span class="italic">The Grave</span> published in quarto and it enjoyed an instantly huge vogue.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Grave</span> features 767 lines of blank verse and is notable more for its luxuriantly melancholy atmosphere rather than for any profound intellectual ideas. Not entirely even in its quality of writing, the poem does feature passages of exquisite description. Its opening section invokes the grave as &#145;Eternal King! Whose potent arm sustains / The keys of Hell and Death&#146;  (ll. 1&#150;10). In a manner that sets the tone for the rest of the poem, Blair proceeds very morbidly to describe the physical horror of the tomb  (ll. 11&#150;27), the eeriness of the churchyard and human loneliness  (ll. 28&#150;87), and from there reflects on &#145;Friendship! mysterious cement of the soul&#146;  (ll. 88&#150;110). Returning to contemplation of the grave, the poet considers the foolish vanity of mankind when set against this certainty, producing a fervent <i>contemptus mundi</i>  (ll. 111&#150;368). The poem next considers the strangeness and imponderability of death and includes some of the piece's finest moments on the fragility of human life and understanding  (ll. 369&#150;633). The final 140 lines of the poem bring a far from entirely convincing and rather forced, pietistic meditation on human sin and the resurrection.<br>
<br>As one commentator has noted, &#145;<span class="italic">The Grave</span> accorded with the Post-Enlightenment vogue of melancholy&#146;  (Simpson, 11). Along with Edward Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts on Life, Death, and Immortality</span> (1742&#150;5), Blair's poem initiated a fashion for &#145;mortuary poems&#146; and Young himself had been inspired to continue in his own, longer project by the success of Blair's work. Blair's poetry is a harbinger of the literary cult of sentiment and paves the way for the melancholy writing of such proto-Romantic writers as Thomas Gray and James Macpherson. The repeated publication of <span class="italic">The Grave</span> also afforded the opportunity for one of the great Romantic artists, William Blake, to provide illustrations for it in 1808.<br>
<br>In spite of his literary fame, or perhaps because of the awkwardness with which this sat upon a Church of Scotland minister (a number of talented Scottish literary divines found such a co-existence difficult), Blair published nothing else and no literary manuscripts were found posthumously among his effects. Robert Blair died of a fever on 4 February 1746 and was buried in the churchyard at Athelstaneford under a plain stone marked &#145;R. B.&#146;.<br>
