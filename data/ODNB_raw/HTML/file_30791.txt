<span class="headword">Barnes,  Alfred John</span>  (1887&#150;1974), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 17 July 1887 at 3 Gordon Terrace, Plaistow, West Ham, London, the youngest of seven children of William Barnes, a docker and coffee-house keeper, and his wife, Lucinda Margaret Smith. At the age of eight he lost a leg in a fairground accident. He was educated at the Star Road Boys' School, an elementary school between Manor Road and Barking Road, Canning Town, at the Northampton Institute from 1905, and at the London County Council School of Arts and Crafts. After serving his apprenticeship he became a skilled designer and worker in precious metals. He established his own silversmith's business, which he relinquished in 1922 when it was earning him an income in excess of the &pound;400 a year he was paid on his election to parliament.<br>
<br>The grim poverty of the majority of inhabitants of east London was graphically described by the author Jack London in his book <span class="italic">The People of the Abyss</span> (1902), but Barnes learned about conditions of employment in the nearby docks from his father who, though he became a foreman, had joined the strike of 1889 for the dockers &#145;tanner&#146;. His craft training had generated in him a search for realistic solutions to the problems he confronted, and from an early age he sought to improve the living conditions of the people of east London through co-operation and political action. In 1908 he joined the Stratford Co-operative Society and the Independent Labour Party (ILP).<br>
<br>Barnes was an industrious and reliable person who gained widespread respect for his integrity of character. These qualities ensured his quick promotion. Already by 1910 he was secretary of the East London Federation of the ILP. He was elected to the management committee of the Stratford Co-operative Society in 1914 and became its president in 1915. In 1920 he played a major part in the founding of the London Co-operative Society, and served as its first president from 1920 to 1923. He was also a council member of the National Union of Gold, Silver, and Allied Trades. On 5 March 1921 Barnes married Leila Phoebe Real (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), whom he met through his silversmith business; she was the daughter of Charles Real, an engraver of Pitsea, Essex. There were three daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>The circumstances of the First World War gave Barnes the opportunity to achieve one of his aims&#151;the establishment of a Co-operative Party with representatives at Westminster and on local councils. Co-operative congresses as early as 1897 had voted in favour of such an organization, but the hesitation of societies whose members were adherents of the Liberal Party delayed the implementation of the resolution. By 1917, however, co-operators were in &#145;revolt from one end of the country to another&#146;  (A. J. Barnes, <span class="italic">The Political Aspects of Co-Operation</span>, 1922, 14) because of the unfair treatment received from the coalition government and its subordinate authorities as regards taxation (of dividends); allocation of supplies; representation on wartime fuel and food committees; and unjust decisions from military tribunals which exempted many owners and managers of small businesses from military service but denied similar concessions to managers of co-operatives. At the Swansea Co-operative Congress early in 1917 Barnes seconded a resolution calling for the establishment of a Co-operative Party. This won nearly unanimous support. At the 1918 general election the party fielded ten candidates, but only one was elected. He was elected to the Co-operative Party's national committee in 1920, and was its chairman from 1924 to 1945.<br>
<br>At the general election of November 1922 Barnes was elected as MP for East Ham South, one of four Co-operative Labour candidates to be returned to parliament. On the opposition benches at Westminster they were swamped by 138 MPs who were elected on the straight Labour Party ticket. Barnes, again always the realist, recognized that the situation had changed. At the Cheltenham congress of the Co-operative Party in 1927 he supported the continued existence of the party but acknowledged that its future lay in general support for the Labour Party, of which it became, in effect, a wing.<br>
<br>Barnes won steadily increasing, if unspectacular, recognition from his colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party because of his pleasant manner and transparent sincerity. Between his election to the Commons in 1922 and the loss of his seat at East Ham South in the general election d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of Labour of 27 October 1931, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to William Graham at the exchequer (1922&#150;4), Labour whip (1925&#150;30), and junior lord of the Treasury from 11 June 1929 to 23 October 1930.<br>
<br>In the general election of November 1935 Barnes regained his seat at East Ham South and retained it until his voluntary retirement in 1955. Although he followed the Labour Party line in domestic politics, in the late 1930s co-operative society and party members, led by Barnes and Sydney Elliott, editor of the Co-operative Press Sunday newspaper, <span class="italic">Reynolds News</span>, took an independent position. They favoured the creation of an anti-aggression &#145;peace pact&#146; of all peace-loving members of the League of Nations to resist fascist states that violated the sovereignty of other countries. At a big peace demonstration in London's Hyde Park on 19 September 1937 Barnes declared that the National Government was loading Britain with the burden of armaments, without a realization of the road by which peace could be secured. Elliott's proposed United Peace Alliance was, however, defeated when put to the vote at the Co-operative Congress in June 1938. He held no ministerial office during the Second World War, but remained active in the co-operative movement. He was a founder of the People's Entertainment Society and, in conjunction with Stafford Cripps, the Anglo-Chinese Development Society.<br>
<br>Barnes is chiefly remembered for his piloting through parliament of the <span class="roman">Transport Bill</span>, one of the major projects of nationalization of the post-war Attlee Labour government. He was appointed minister of war transport on 3 August 1945 and, when the department changed its name, minister of transport in 1946. The aim of the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1947, was to bring inland transport under comprehensive control through the British Transport Commission. This had supervision of the six executives for the six different forms of publicly owned transport, of which the railway executive was the most important. Barnes had little difficulty in gaining approval for the nationalization of the railways, as both Lloyd George and Churchill had advocated it as early as 1918. He had less success with his plans for the control of road freight haulage through the road haulage executive. On 12 March 1947, in a memorandum to the cabinet, he reported that: &#145;No feature of the <span class="roman">Transport Bill</span> raises so much opposition as the proposal to limit &#147;C&#148; licence holders [those who used their own vehicles for moving their own freight] to a distance of forty miles from their base&#146;, and that a deputation of hauliers he had interviewed were &#145;taking root and branch opposition to this part of the Bill&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CAB 128/9). Barnes removed the 40 mile limit from the bill; but in doing so he roused the ire of his own back-benchers, who saw the concession as undermining the transport integration objectives of the legislation.<br>
<br>For the management of the new undertakings established under the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1947, parliament adopted the policies of Herbert Morrison, lord president of the council. These took the form of the &#145;corporatism&#146; exemplified by Morrison's <span class="roman">London Passenger Transport Act</span>, 1933, rather than of the &#145;mutualism&#146; (workers' and transport users' participation) advocated by the Co-operative Party. In his <span class="italic">Socialisation and Transport</span> (1933) Morrison had urged that members of publicly owned boards should be appointed by the minister responsible &#145;primarily on suitable grounds of competence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Socialisation and Transport</span>, 157) as by these means &#145;Parliamentary action against a Board would be reduced to the minimum&#151;which is much to be desired&#146;  (ibid., 174). However, adopting the Morrisonian approach left Barnes to confront back-bench opinion that it perpetuated the purely &#145;commodity&#146; status of labour and denied workers a sense of involvement in the industry and the enjoyment of their full citizenship rights.<br>
<br>After his <span class="roman">Transport Bill</span> had passed through all its stages Barnes supported cautious consolidation of the public ownership measures so far achieved. He was one of the members of the cabinet who, on 7 August 1947, favoured the postponement of the introduction of the <span class="roman">Steel Bill</span> to the session 1948&#150;9. He knew that the workforce in the steel industry was less committed to public ownership than were those employed in the coalmines or on the railways. On the other hand Barnes's more left-wing colleagues believed that &#145;he who controlled the citadel of steel would control shipbuilding, the motor industry&#151;in effect British industry as a whole&#146;. In the event, to placate the left the <span class="roman">Iron and Steel Bill</span>, which became law at the end of 1949, was a compromise measure which Barnes loyally supported.<br>
<br>In the general election of 25 October 1951 Barnes retained his seat with a large majority, but nationally the Conservatives secured a narrow majority and returned to power. The Churchill government rushed through the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1953, which provided for the return to private ownership of the road transport assets of the road haulage executive. The former minister of transport, who held that office for a longer period of time than any of his predecessors, was powerless to prevent the undermining of an important part of his main legislative achievement. He was now sixty-five and in the ensuing months felt that he was less needed in the Commons than he had been. He decided to retire from parliament at the end of the 1954&#150;5 session.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Alfred Barnes's main hobby was caravanning with his wife and daughters. They toured the Essex coast until they found a site at Walton on the Naze, where he bought 2 acres of land as a parking place. On his retirement in 1955 he bought the adjacent Eastcliff Hotel, and more land on which he developed a holiday caravan site. The rooms of the hotel were converted into flats, one for his wife and himself and one each for two of his daughters. The third daughter lived in the USA with her American husband. In 1957 he was elected as independent&#151;as all the councillors in that area were elected&#151;to the Frinton and Walton urban district council. He died in his flat overlooking the North Sea, at Brenalwood, Hall Lane, Walton on the Naze, on 26 November 1974.<br>
