<span class="headword">Lorimer,  William Laughton</span>  (1885&#150;1967), <span class="occ">classical scholar and translator</span>, was born in Strathmartine, near Dundee, on 27 June 1885, the son of the Revd Robert Lorimer (1840&#150;1925), a minister in the United Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Isabella Lockhart Robertson (1849&#150;1931). Lorimer was educated at Dundee high school, at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and at Trinity College, Oxford. After graduating from Oxford in 1910 he lived permanently in St Andrews, except for a period of military service in the First World War. A fondness for Italy, developed during a few months' residence there in 1904&#150;5, later prompted him to active efforts in support of Italian prisoners of war. Lorimer held teaching posts in Latin and Greek at St Andrews University and University College, Dundee. In 1915 he married Marion Rose Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1922). They had one son, Robert Lewis Campbell (Robin) Lorimer (1918&#150;1996). A second marriage, made in 1929 during a period of extreme distress and despondency, was annulled within a year. From his boyhood Lorimer had shown a consuming interest in Scots vernacular speech, beginning by collecting words from the dialect of Strathmartine in Angus (his father's parish): the knowledge so obtained enabled him to become a valuable informant and consultant for the <span class="italic">Scottish National Dictionary</span> and latterly also its chairman.<br>
<br>Despite valuable publications on Greek and Latin texts and on the demographic history of Gaelic, Lorimer's most important achievement was the work of his retirement from the chair of Greek at St Andrews. This was his Scots translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, made directly from the Greek originals and prepared for by a long and distinguished life of scholarship in classical literature and lexicography, the written and spoken forms of Scots, and the tradition of <span class="roman">Bible</span> translation in many European languages and dialects. Lorimer's aim was to revitalize the declining Scots vernacular tongue by producing a monumental prose work exploiting the full resources of the language. In this he succeeded triumphantly. As a literary and linguistic achievement, the only parallel in Scots letters to his testament is the sixteenth-century translation of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> by Gavin Douglas. Lorimer's translation contains many rare words of local currency but almost none of the literary archaisms frequent in modern Scots writing, and conveys the rhythms, cadences, and idiomatic phrasing of spoken Scots with unerring skill. Perhaps uniquely among <span class="roman">Bible</span> translations, his style is deliberately varied to reflect the characteristics of the original books. The complete work, edited by his son Robin Lorimer, was not published until 1983, sixteen years after William Laughton Lorimer's death of cancer at 18 Eglinton Crescent, Edinburgh, on 25 May 1967. His body was cremated and the ashes interred in the cemetery at Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire, where a memorial to him was erected in the church. Lorimer's Scots <span class="roman">New Testament</span> has been widely read and appreciated, sometimes being used in services of worship, and is recognized as the most complete demonstration in recent literature of the expressive power of Scots.<br>
