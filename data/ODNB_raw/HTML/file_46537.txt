<span class="headword">Cousins,  James Henry Sproull</span>  (1873&#150;1956), <span class="occ">writer and educationist</span>, was born on 22 July 1873 at 29 Cavour Street, Belfast, the son of James Cousins (<i>d</i>. 1920), a sailor, and his wife, Susan Davis (<i>d</i>. 1915). His parents were both Wesleyan Methodists; his father retired from a sailing career to work for the Belfast harbour commission, while his mother managed the home and family. Having finished his formal schooling at the age of twelve Cousins studied shorthand and typing in the Belfast Mercantile Academy and later became private secretary and speech-writer for the mayor of Belfast.<br>
<br>Inspired by the fiction of Samuel Ferguson, Cousins joined the Gaelic League in Belfast and began to write romantic Celtic poetry, publishing his first poem, <span class="italic">Ben Madighan</span>, in 1894. Attracted by the literary revival, Cousins moved in 1897 to Dublin, where he worked first as a clerk in a coal and shipping company and then as a teacher at the high school on Harcourt Street. On 9 April 1903 he married Margaret Elizabeth Gillespie (1878&#150;1954) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46323/', "Cousins, Margaret Elizabeth")</script>] of Boyle, co. Roscommon. Raised in the Church of Ireland, Margaret Gillespie was a music student. Their marriage began a co-operative venture in a range of social reform activities such as vegetarianism, cycling, feminism, religious ecumenism, and the revival of folk art and music.<br>
<br>From 1901 to 1905 James Cousins was a catalyst to the formation of the Abbey Theatre and of the Irish National Theatre, formed in April 1902, which he provided with its first two plays, <span class="italic">The Sleep of the King</span> and <span class="italic">The Racing Lug</span>. Although Yeats initially encouraged him to contribute plays, by October of 1902 he had notoriously &#145;snuffed out&#146; Cousins, calling his work &#145;vulgar rubbish&#146;. It is not clear why Yeats manifested such a sudden aversion to Cousins's plays, although critics have both noted the similarity of Yeats's ideas to those of Cousins and speculated on the likelihood of a clash of egos.<br>
<br>Instead Cousins became increasingly immersed in the occult. A friend of the poet&#150;artist&#150;occultist George Russell (AE), he attended s&eacute;ances with AE and W. B. Yeats while Margaret Cousins became a medium with the dead. In July 1907 the Cousinses attended the convention of the Theosophical Society in London, at which the president, Annie Besant, instructed Margaret Cousins to form a theosophical lodge in Dublin. The theosophical belief in an ancient wisdom which embraced all knowledge, science, magic, and religion framed the Cousinses' romantic universalism. Theosophy's theoretical inclusiveness and celebration of feminine intuition afforded platforms of cultural authority to intellectual women excluded from mainstream churches, and to the men who supported them. Much of James Cousins's energy from 1908 to 1913 was taken up as a stalwart suffragist supporter of the Irish Women's Franchise League (IWFL), co-founded in 1908 by his wife. James Cousins co-edited the weekly newspaper of the IWFL, the <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span>.<br>
<br>When an effort to direct a co-operative bank resulted in James Cousins's bankruptcy, the Cousinses decided to take up another position, marketing vegetarian foods for a British company. After two years near Liverpool, disillusioned by industrial English culture and the outbreak of the war, James Cousins wrote to Annie Besant at the international headquarters of the Theosophical Society in Madras to offer his editorial services to her nationalist newspaper <span class="italic">New India</span>.<br>
<br>On 11 November 1915 the Cousinses arrived in Madras. Although they had their differences with Besant over the place of feminism in the national movement, they spent the next forty years working in theosophical schools. For the most part they were stationed in the inland town of Madanapalle. While Margaret Cousins became a nationally known figure for her leadership of the women's movement, James Cousins became known for his promotion of both folk and classical arts, crafts, literature, and music. In 1922 he established a school for the arts in Madras which would become the renowned Kalakeshetra and from 1934 was art adviser to the government of Travancore. In India he continued to publish poetry and politically engaged literary treatises critical of western cultural imperialism. Altogether he published more than fifty books and countless articles. Both of the Cousinses were prominent activists throughout the Indian freedom movement.<br>
<br>From 1943 until her death in 1954 James Cousins nursed his wife through a series of strokes. He died on 20 February 1956 in Madanapalle, where his body was cremated the following day.<br>
