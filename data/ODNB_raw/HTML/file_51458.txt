<span class="headword">Rignold <span class="st"> [Rignall]</span>,  George Richard</span>  (1839&#150;1912), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Leicester, the second son of the actors William Ross Rignold (1813&#150;1883) and his wife, Patricia Blaxland (1800&#150;1888). Music was George Rignold's first love and he became an accomplished violinist, but his father encouraged him to take to the stage, which offered better financial prospects. After early experience at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, Rignold joined J. H. Chute's company in Bath and Bristol. In the production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> with which the new Theatre Royal, Bath, opened on 4 March 1863 Rignold played Theseus in a notable cast, which included his elder brother William (1836&#150;1904) as Lysander, Charles Coghlan as Demetrius, Henrietta Hodson as Oberon, Ellen Terry as Titania, and the father and daughter William and Madge Robertson (later Dame Madge Kendal) as Egeus and Second Singing Fairy respectively.<br>
<br>In March 1869, following further engagements with Chute and others in Plymouth, Swansea, and Manchester, Rignold progressed to the metropolis, to the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, where E. J. Young's company included Henrietta Hodson, Mrs Stirling, and Charles Wyndham. Rignold made his mark in a range of parts: Sir John Bridges in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">'Twixt Axe and Crown</span> and Father Isambard in the same author's <span class="italic">Joan of Arc</span>; William in Douglas Jerrold's <span class="italic">Black-Eyed Susan</span>, which he also played at the Holborn Theatre; and Shakespeare's Caliban (28 October 1871), Posthumus (30 March 1872), and Romeo, to Adelaide Neilson's Juliet (14 September 1872). Roles in contemporary plays followed: Westland Marston's <span class="italic">Put to the Test</span> at the Olympic Theatre in February 1873, Herman Merivale's <span class="italic">The White Pilgrim</span> at the Court Theatre in February 1874, and the first provincial tour of Taylor's <span class="italic">Clancarty</span> in the same year, but it was his casting as Henry V in New York in 1875 that proved to be the turning point in Rignold's career.<br>
<br>Charles Calvert's revival of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> had been such an outstanding success at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester, in 1872 and subsequently on tour that it had been bought by the New York managers Jarrett and Palmer. Calvert supervised the staging at Booth's Theatre in February 1875, but, because of his poor health, stepped down from the title role and cast Rignold in his stead. Calvert's elaborate stagecraft and detailed realization of medieval pageantry and warfare were a revelation to New Yorkers. Rignold's Henry V, though it lacked the subtlety of Calvert's own interpretation, impressed American audiences, for whom Henry James can stand as a spokesman: &#145;He plays the part in a most natural fashion, looks it and wears it to perfection, and declaims its swelling harangues with admirable vigour and taste. He is worth looking at and listening to&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>, 11 March 1875). Now dubbed Rignold Rex and Handsome George, Rignold was f&ecirc;ted by lady admirers&#151;his wooing of Princess Katherine was considered to be his finest scene&#151;and his photographs by Sarony sold in huge quantities.<br>
<br>Rignold took <span class="italic">Henry V</span> across America, from the east coast to Salt Lake City and on to San Francisco, and thence to Australia and New Zealand. Acclaim was universal: &#145;His interpretation in every sense of the word is perfection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wellington Evening Chronicle</span>, 27 Dec 1878). It was not just the influence of England's theatre that Rignold was spreading across the globe, but also, especially with such a patriotic play as <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, her history and culture. The success of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> had encouraged Rignold to add Macbeth to his repertory at Booth's Theatre in May 1875, but this served only to reveal his limitations as an actor. Even with Henry V the more exacting London critics expressed reservations when Rignold appeared at Drury Lane in November 1879: &#145;He does but small justice to the noble words put into his mouth. His elocution is imperfect, often incorrect in emphasis, too hurried, and deficient in kingly dignity. He seems too anxious to get over the speeches and come to the fighting&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Nov 1879).<br>
<br>The strictures of the London critics, compared with the plaudits of their American and Australian counterparts, no doubt influenced Rignold's decision to pursue his career in Australia. On 25 March 1882 he appeared in Melbourne as Frank Darlington in Augustus Harris's Drury Lane success <span class="italic">Youth</span>, and, following a brief business trip to England to buy plays and other requisites, Rignold went into partnership with James Allison at Her Majesty's Opera House, Melbourne. Later the two men took Her Majesty's Theatre in Sydney, of which, following Allison's death in 1895, Rignold assumed sole charge. During the nine years from 1888 Rignold mounted plays from the English repertory: melodramas such as Watts Phillips's <span class="italic">The Dead Heart</span> and Charles Reade's <span class="italic">The Lyons Mail</span>, Gilbert Parker's version of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, and Shakespeare. He performed in most of the productions himself and attracted several notable English actors to his theatre, playing Mark Antony to J. F. Cathcart's Brutus, Master Ford to his brother William's Falstaff, and Macbeth to Janet Achurch's Lady Macbeth. Rignold proclaimed: &#145;I made Shakespeare pay. I never lost a farthing over any of my revivals, and I did the pieces as well as it was possible with all the best attainable effects electric and otherwise&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 8 Nov 1902). In an age in which international copyright was more honoured in the breach than the observance Rignold was scrupulous in remunerating living authors.<br>
<br>Rignold returned to London in 1902 to appear in a benefit performance for his, by then blind, brother William. Rignold's first wife, whom he married on 28 September 1865, the actress Marie Braybrook Henderson, had supported him in his various enterprises, and died in Australia on 26 February 1902. His second marriage, on 3 October 1907, was to Georgina Harriet Dora Coppin (1864&#150;1911), the daughter of the Australian politician and theatre manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32562/', "George Selth Coppin")</script>. He had no children from either marriage. Rignold lived quietly at his property on the beautiful shore of Sydney's Middle Harbour, though he made a return to the Melbourne stage in 1907 as Jason in Hall Caine's <span class="italic">The Bondsman</span>. He died in a Sydney nursing home, Charlemont Private Hospital, Darlinghurst, on 16 December 1912. His death was extensively reported in his home country, but had he remained there he would not have achieved as great an eminence as he did in Australia: &#145;He trained as far as possible an Australian company of players, and throughout his career set up a high artistic standard which did much to place the Australian stage in its present position&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Dec 1912).<br>
