<span class="headword">Basing,  Adam  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1262<span class="mult">x</span>6), <span class="occ">draper</span>, is believed to have been the son of the aldermanic landowner Peter of Basing; he was the grandson of Solomon of Basing, alderman of London and mayor in 1217. Adam became a draper and city merchant, achieving eminence as a supplier to the royal household while at the same time pursuing a successful civic career. Little detail is known of his political activity in London, but the fact that he was elected an alderman of Cheap ward in 1247&#150;60, was sheriff 1243&#150;4, and mayor 1251&#150;2 is evidence of his high standing.<br>
<br>The full range of Basing's mercantile activities is not known, and it is as the supplier of large quantities of cloths of gold, fine silks, embroideries, and ecclesiastical vestments to Henry III between 1238 and 1260 that he is best-known. Some were for domestic use, either for the king himself or for his family: in 1238, for example, he provided rich silk cloths for a quilt and mattress for the king's sister Eleanor, and in 1251 vestments for the chapel of the king's daughter Margaret on her marriage to Alexander III, king of Scots. However, a large part of the goods supplied by Basing were silk vestments&#151;chasubles, copes, and mitres&#151;or the decorative elements to adorn them, destined to be presented by the king to esteemed clerics visiting his court or to churches visited by the king. Not surprisingly Henry bestowed many upon St Peter's, Westminster, the church that he favoured above all others.<br>
<br>Because so much of Basing's trade was in vestments or embroideries it has been suggested that he ran his own tailoring and embroidery workshops. There is no evidence to support this conjecture and it is equally possible that he purchased or commissioned such goods directly from city craftsmen. The circumstances under which medieval embroideries were worked are unknown and may have been more domestic in nature; the embroideries that Basing traded in were often orphreys, the jewel-enriched or embroidered bands used to adorn vestments, which could be worked in frames in limited accommodation.<br>
<br>Adam of Basing's marriage to Desiderata, the daughter of Arnulf fitz Alulf and Dyonisia Viel, further strengthened his family's links within the London aldermanic class. His son Thomas, like a nephew also named Thomas, became an important woolmonger; he died young, however, and the fortunes of the family were advanced by Adam's grandson Peter, who married into the Frowicks, another wealthy aldermanic family. In 1247 Adam of Basing had acquired the soke of Aldermanbury, within the northern boundary of the city, which included six shops and the advowsons of three churches. To this he gradually added further property in the locality, in Cheap and in Wood Street, as well as land in more distant parishes such as St Giles and St Pancras. The imposing mansion he built in Aldermanbury in the 1250s was destroyed by irate Londoners during the troubles of 1263. The family name is commemorated in that ward in Basinghall Street, Basing Lane, and Bassishaw. Basing was alive in 1262, but had died by August 1266, when the king granted the wardship of his son and heir, Thomas, to a member of another aldermanic family.<br>
