<span class="headword">Williams,  Robert</span>  (1810&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Celtic scholar and antiquary</span>, was born at Conwy, Caernarvonshire, on 29 June 1810, the second son of Robert Williams, perpetual curate of Llandudno. He attended Beaumaris and Shrewsbury schools, before matriculating as servitor on 10 June 1828 from Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1832 and MA in 1836. After a short curacy at Llangernyw in west Denbighshire (1833&#150;6), in 1837 he was appointed vicar of Llangadwaladr, to which was added in 1838 the perpetual curacy of Rhydycroesau, near Oswestry. He held the former until 1877, and the latter until 1879, when he was appointed to the rectory of Culmington, Shropshire. This, together with an honorary canonry at St Asaph conferred upon him in 1872, he held until his death.<br>
<br>While still an undergraduate Williams had shown his interest in Welsh history by winning, in 1831, a prize offered by the Cymmrodorion Society for the best &#145;biographical sketch of the most eminent Welshmen since the Reformation&#146;. The society had his production translated into Welsh and printed under the title of <span class="italic">Enwogion Cymru</span>. In 1836 the English version was issued with additions, and it was subsequently developed into <span class="italic">Enwogion Cymru: a Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Welshmen</span> (1852).<br>
<br>Williams's most scholarly work, however, was his <span class="italic">Lexicon Cornu-Britannicum: a Dictionary of the Ancient Celtic Language of Cornwall</span> (1865). In this lexicon copious examples with English translations were given from Cornish works, but its special feature was the addition of synonyms and cognate words from Welsh, Breton, Erse, Gaelic, and Manx. The author announced his intention of issuing a Cornish grammar, but this never appeared. When the Catholic epistles and gospels (<span class="italic">Liherieu hag Avieleu</span>, 1870) were first brought out in Breton, with parallel Welsh and Gaelic versions, Williams was responsible for much of the Gaelic text. He also discovered at Peniarth Library the only extant copy of a previously unknown Cornish drama, the <span class="italic">Ordinale de vita sancti Mereadoci</span>. This was edited and translated by Whitley Stokes and published in 1872.<br>
<br>Williams's next undertaking was the editing, with translations and glossaries, of <span class="italic">Selections from the Hengwrt MSS Preserved in the Peniarth Library</span>. The first volume, which was completed in 1876, contains the Welsh text of the legend of the holy grail. Of the second volume, containing the Welsh versions of the &#145;Gests of Charlemayne&#146;, &#145;Bown o' Hamtwn&#146;, the &#145;Elucidarium&#146;, and other religious compilations of the middle ages, two parts only were issued during Williams's lifetime (in 1878 and 1880 respectively), but the translation was completed with critical and bibliographical notes by the Revd G. Hartwell Jones, and the second volume completed in 1892. This, in spite of its importance, is perhaps the least satisfactory of Williams's works, as his reading of the text is sometimes unreliable.<br>
<br>Williams supplied a translation of the Welsh poems contained in the <span class="italic">Book of Taliesin</span> (a thirteenth-century manuscript then preserved at Peniarth) for William Forbes Skene's <span class="italic">Four Ancient Books of Wales</span> (1868). He also wrote a history of his native town, published in 1835 under the title of <span class="italic">The History of Aberconway</span>. He was for many years a member of the editorial committee of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, and contributed papers to the journal of that society as well as to the <span class="italic">Cambrian Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Williams died, unmarried, on 26 April 1881 at Culmington rectory. He was buried on 2 May at Culmington, where a memorial stone with a Welsh and Cornish inscription, provided by public subscription, was placed in 1899.<br>
