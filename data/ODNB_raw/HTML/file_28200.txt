<span class="headword">Verdon <span class="st"> [Verdun]</span>,  Bertram  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1192), <span class="occ">judge and administrator</span>, was the son of Norman de Verdon and Luceline, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5680/', "Geoffrey of Clinton")</script>, chamberlain to Henry I. He is mentioned as adhering to Henry II against his rebel sons in 1173. In 1175 and the three following years he was regularly present as a baron at the sittings of the <i>curia regis</i>, and from 1175 to 1179, and probably later, served as itinerant justice in eight counties. In 1170 he accounted as sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire, in succession to William Basset and presumably benefiting from the removal of the sheriffs at Easter 1170. He continued as sheriff until 1184  (Pipe rolls, 30 Henry II, 43). In March 1177 he was sent with others of the king's counsellors by Henry to Fernando II, king of Le&oacute;n, to negotiate and announce his intention of making a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.<br>
<br>Verdon accompanied John to Ireland in 1185 and remained as his seneschal of Ireland after John's return to England in the same year. Gerald of Wales mentions staying with him in Dublin and his house remained a well-known landmark in Dublin throughout the middle ages. He was also appointed custodian of the castle of Drogheda following Hugh de Lacy's death in 1186. While in Ireland John granted him lands equivalent to the baronies of Upper and Lower Dundalk in the modern co. Louth, although the earliest surviving record of this grant comes from the years 1189&#150;91. He established a manor at the site now known as Castletown, west of the present town of Dundalk, with a parish church dedicated to St John the Baptist. He, or possibly his son Nicholas, founded a house for the Crutched Friars dedicated to St Leonard at Seatown in Dundalk itself. He left Ireland before the end of 1189.<br>
<br>Verdon continued in the service of Richard I, witnessing charters at Canterbury on 1 December 1189 and at Westminster in January 1190, and accompanied Richard to the Holy Land. He was surety for Richard's peace with Tancred of Sicily in November 1190 and witnessed a charter at Messina on 23 January 1191. He arrived in Palestine in June 1191, and on 21 August was left with Stephen de Longchamp in charge of Acre and the queens of England and Sicily, and the daughter of the emperor of Cyprus, while Richard proceeded towards Jerusalem. Verdon died the following year (1192) at Jaffa. Among other religious benefactions he founded in 1176 the Cistercian abbey of Croxden in Staffordshire, where his chief lands were.<br>
<br>Verdon's first wife was Maud, daughter of Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby (<i>d</i>. 1159), with whom he had no children. He and his second wife, Rohese, had six sons of whom two, Thomas and Nicholas, succeeded in turn to his estates. His one daughter, Lesceline, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15853/', "Hugh de Lacy, later earl of Ulster (d. 1242)")</script>. Nicholas's only daughter and heir, Rohese, married Theobald Butler, and was grandmother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28201/', "Theobald de Verdon")</script>.<br>
