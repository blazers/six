<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carpenter,  John Archibald  Boyd-</span>, Baron Boyd-Carpenter  (1908&#150;1998), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 June 1908 at 22 Park Avenue, Harrogate, Yorkshire, the only son (there was one daughter) of Sir Archibald Boyd Boyd-Carpenter (1873&#150;1937), politician, and his wife, Annie, second daughter of Thomas Dugdale, of Cross Hill, Blackburn, Lancashire. His father was Unionist MP for North Bradford (1918&#150;23) and Coventry (1924&#150;9), and was briefly financial secretary to the Treasury and then paymaster-general in the Conservative government of 1922&#150;4. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32305/', "William Boyd Carpenter")</script>, bishop of Ripon and canon of Westminster, reputedly Queen Victoria's favourite bishop.<br>
<br>Boyd-Carpenter was educated at Stowe School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1930, and a diploma in economic and political science in 1931. He was elected president of the Oxford Union in 1930 and then studied at the Middle Temple, where he was made Harmsworth law scholar in 1933 and won the Council of Legal Education prize for constitutional law the same year. He was called to the bar in 1934, and practised on the London and south-eastern circuit until the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1934 he engaged in his first political campaign when he stood as the Municipal Reform candidate for Limehouse in the London county council elections. On 25 June 1937 he married Margaret Mary Hall (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel George Leslie Hall, officer in the Royal Engineers. They had one son and two daughters. During the Second World War he served in the Scots Guards and rose to the rank of major. His legal experience was deployed when he served from 1943 to 1945 with the allied military government in Italy, for whom he acted as a president of military courts.<br>
<br>Boyd-Carpenter entered parliament at the general election of 1945 as MP for the safe Conservative seat of Kingston upon Thames, a constituency which he represented until 1972. In opposition from 1945 to 1951 he established a reputation as an effective and pugnacious debater in the Commons and attracted the attention of the Conservative leadership. When the Conservatives were returned to power in October 1951 he was appointed financial secretary to the Treasury, and in July 1954 he was promoted to the (non-cabinet) position of minister of transport and civil aviation. While holding the latter post he set in motion the building of Britain's first major length of motorway, the M1, which was completed under his successor Ernest Marples. In December 1955 he was moved to the (non-cabinet) position of minister of pensions and national insurance, which he occupied until July 1962. In this post he was responsible for the pensions legislation of 1959, which broke from Beveridge's principle of flat-rate contributions for flat-rate benefits as it introduced earnings-related pensions for earnings-related contributions, and gave individuals the opportunity to &#145;contract out&#146; of the state pension scheme into private occupational pensions. From 1960 to 1962 he also made important contributions to the Conservative Party's internal policy committee on the future of the social services, which discussed in detail the structure and funding of the welfare state and examined the possibility of introducing radical reforms. When he was pensions minister he also oversaw the appointment of Margaret Thatcher to her first ministerial position, which was in his department. In July 1962 he entered the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury and paymaster-general, which at the time was only the second occasion on which cabinet rank had been granted to that position. At the Treasury he participated in the establishment of the National Economic Development Council and the National Incomes Commission, and he played an important role in approving funding for the Concorde project. In 1963 Harold Macmillan's successor as prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, offered Boyd-Carpenter the position of chairman of the Conservative Party, but he declined.<br>
<br>After the Conservative defeat in October 1964 Boyd-Carpenter was made shadow cabinet spokesman on housing. In 1965 he was one of the few senior figures in the party who opposed the introduction of the new electoral procedure for choosing the Conservative leader. He was dropped from the shadow cabinet in 1966 by the first Conservative leader chosen under the new process, Edward Heath, and he remained a back-bencher until he left the Commons in 1972. He was an active back-bencher. He extended his reputation as an aggressive parliamentary debater, and he held the post of chairman of the House of Commons' public accounts committee from 1964 to 1970. He hoped in 1972 to become speaker of the House of Commons, but the Labour opposition supported the election of Selwyn Lloyd. Disappointed, Boyd-Carpenter resigned his seat to take up the position of chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and he was made a life peer, as Baron Boyd-Carpenter.<br>
<br>As chairman of the CAA Boyd-Carpenter was responsible for granting the certificate of airworthiness to Concorde, and he was a passenger on its first commercial flight to Bahrain in 1976. He left the CAA in 1977, having in 1976 taken the post of chairman of Rugby-Portland Cement, of which he had been a director since 1970. He held this position until 1984. He also held directorships of two financial institutions, the Orion insurance company from 1969 to 1972, and the CLRP investment trust from 1970 to 1972. Although business was his primary interest after he left the Commons, he remained politically active. From 1977 to 1980 he was president of the Wessex National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, from 1979 to 1986 he was chairman of the Carlton Club, and from 1985 to 1990 he was chairman, and then from 1991 to 1998 president, of the Association of Conservative Peers. His children's careers reinforced his continued political ties. His son Sir Thomas Boyd-Carpenter was chairman of Kensington, Chelsea, and Westminster Health Authority after a distinguished career in the army, and his younger daughter, Sarah, Baroness Hogg, was head of the prime minister's policy unit from 1990 to 1995.<br>
<br>Although he never reached the highest levels in politics, Boyd-Carpenter was a substantial political figure. He enjoyed a reputation as a tough Commons debater, a reputation which in part helped to explain why the Labour Party was not supportive of his claim to the speakership in 1972. As a minister his colleagues, both senior and junior, always found him competent, well informed, and thorough, and Thatcher referred to his &#145;grasp of detail, and capacity for lucid exposition of a complex case&#146;  (Thatcher, 119). Both his political longevity and his failure to advance to the front rank perhaps reflected the fact that he did not take up a strong ideological position and excited little in the way of strong praise or opprobrium from either side of politics. In the late 1940s he described <span class="italic">The Industrial Charter</span> as occupying &#145;a central position between Manchester and Moscow&#146;, and he seemed content to take a moderate, central position himself. In 1968 Arthur Seldon, writing in the <span class="italic">Swinton Journal</span>, saw Boyd-Carpenter as a supporter of state intervention, yet at the Ministry of Pensions he had greatly extended the scope of private pensions. In his memoirs, <span class="italic">Way of Life</span> (1980), he noted that &#145;When I was young I was a long distance runner&#151;not fast but I could go on for ever&#146;  (p. 204), and used this as a metaphor for his career. As a description of a solid but unexciting political career it was very apt. He died at his home, Crux Easton House, Crux Easton, Highclere, near Newbury, Berkshire, on 11 July 1998, of cancer, and was survived by his wife and their three children. A memorial service was held at St Margaret by Westminster Abbey, on 3 November 1998, at which Lady Thatcher gave the address.<br>
