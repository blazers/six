<span class="headword">Strachey, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1736&#150;1810), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born in Edinburgh on 23 May 1736, was the eldest surviving son of Henry Strachey (1706&#150;1765) of Sutton Court, Somerset, and his first wife, Helen Clerk, daughter of Robert Clerk, physician, of Listonfield, Edinburghshire, and Edinburgh. His grandfather was the geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26622/', "John Strachey (1671&#150;1743)")</script>. He was educated at Westminster School (1750) and probably worked as a clerk in the war office before he was appointed private secretary to Lord Clive during Clive's last visit to India in 1764. He became a close friend and indispensable colleague to Clive who, in a Commons speech on 30 March 1772, paid tribute to Strachey's &#145;abilities and indefatigable industry&#146;  (Drummond, 488). Strachey had benefited from Clive's financial gains in India and, on his return in July 1767, he benefited from his political patronage as well. Although he failed at the general election in 1768 at Pontefract, where Clive's friend John Walsh held a major interest, he was returned on petition in December and took his seat on the opposition benches with Clive. By 1774 he had followed his patron into voting for the administration and he was returned MP on 10 October 1774 for one of Clive's own boroughs, Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. Strachey married Jane Latham (<i>d</i>. 1824), widow of Captain Thomas Latham RN, daughter of John Kelsall of Greenwich, and a cousin of Lady Clive, on 23 May 1770. They had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64296/', "Edward Strachey")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36335/', "Strachey, Sir Edward, third baronet (1812&#150;1901)")</script>], and two daughters.<br>
<br>In May 1776 Strachey was appointed secretary to Lord Howe, who headed the commission for negotiating peace with America. After returning from America in 1778 Strachey was made clerk of deliveries of the ordnance and was elected MP for the government borough of Saltash, but in 1780 he was re-elected for Bishop's Castle. In spite of his support for Lord North, he held office in the Rockingham administration as joint secretary to the Treasury from March to July 1782, and in Shelburne's government as under-secretary in the Home Office from July 1782 to April 1783. In the latter capacity he assisted in the peace negotiations at Paris. The Fox&#150;North coalition restored him to his old office in the Ordnance but he was turned out when Pitt came to power in December 1783. Strachey followed the lead of the Portland whigs and remained in opposition until 1794; his new-found support for Pitt's government was marked by his appointment as master of the king's household, which he held until his death. He was also rewarded with a baronetcy on 15 June 1801. The prospect of a contest at Bishop's Castle in 1802 led Strachey to look for another seat and he purchased his return at East Grinstead on the duchess of Dorset's interest.<br>
<br>Strachey retired from parliament in 1807 and died on 1 or 2 January 1810 at Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London. His wife survived him, dying on 12 February 1824, and all three of their sons served in India as civil servants.<br>
