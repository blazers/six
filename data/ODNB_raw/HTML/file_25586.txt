<span class="headword">Simpson,  John</span>  (1746&#150;1812), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious writer</span>, the youngest son of Nathaniel Simpson, dissenting minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, was born at Leicester on 19 March 1746. After attending school at Kibworth, Leicestershire, under John Aikin and at Market Harborough, he entered Warrington Academy in 1760. He was a student there while Joseph Priestley was a tutor, and during this time developed Arian views. In 1765, after finishing his studies at Warrington, he migrated to Glasgow University, where he was a pupil of William Leechman. After leaving Glasgow in 1767 he spent the next five years in private study at his parents' home in Leicester.<br>
<br>In April 1772 Simpson succeeded Thomas Bruckshaw as junior minister of High Pavement Presbyterian Chapel, Nottingham, and became sole minister on the death of John Milne in the following September. In 1774 George Walker (1735&#150;1807) became his colleague, and together they won back a section of the congregation which had seceded in 1760. In August 1777 Simpson moved to Walthamstow, Essex, to assist Hugh Farmer as afternoon preacher, but resigned this office in 1779 and retired from active duty. He moved to Cottingham, near Hull, where he married in 1780 Frances Watson, daughter of Thomas Woodhouse of Gainsborough and widow of a Mr Watson of Cottingham. From there he moved to Little Woodham, near Leeds, and then to Leeds itself. In 1791 he settled at Bath for the remainder of his days.<br>
<br>Simpson lived much among his books and made few friends. One of the few was Joseph Stock, bishop of Waterford, the translator of <span class="roman">Job</span> and <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>. Simpson published a few sermons and a number of essays. Those on topics of biblical criticism were collected as <span class="italic">Essays on the Language of Scripture</span> (1806). Of these the most important was &#145;An essay of the duration of a future state of punishments and rewards&#146; (1803). This argument for universal restoration was commended by Priestley in his last days. Among other publications were <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Novelty, Excellence and Evidence of the Christian Religion</span> (1798) and <span class="italic">Thoughts on the New Testament Doctrine of Atonement</span> (1802). A collection of his sermons was published posthumously in 1816.<br>
<br>Simpson died in Bath on 18 August 1812 and was buried on 31 August at Lyncombe Vale, near Bath, in the cemetery belonging to the Bath Unitarian chapel. He was survived by one son, John Woodhouse Simpson of Rearsby, Leicestershire.<br>
