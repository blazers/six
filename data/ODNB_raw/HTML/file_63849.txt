<span class="headword">Anderson,  (Margaret) Betty Harvie</span>, Baroness Skrimshire of Quarter  (1913&#150;1979), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 August 1913 at 9 London Terrace, Glasgow, the only child of Colonel Thomas Alexander Harvie Anderson CB TD DL (<i>d</i>. 1953), solicitor and magistrate, and his wife, Margaret Agnes (Nessie) Wilson Shearer (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of Sir John Shearer, engineer and shipbuilder. She grew up on the family estate at Denny, and was educated at the nearby Quarter village school and St Leonard's School, St Andrews, of which she was later president. After leaving school in 1931 she followed her father into local politics and the volunteer militia, winning election to the Denny district council in 1938 and enlisting in the Auxiliary Territorial Service that same year. During the Second World War she saw action against German raids on the Forth and became chief commander of the mixed anti-aircraft brigade, a post she held until 1946. She became the first woman to join the Glasgow Territorial Association, of which her father was secretary for twenty-nine years.<br>
<br>In November 1945 Betty Harvie Anderson was elected to Stirlingshire county council for the division her father was vacating and in 1953 she became leader of the council's moderates (Conservatives). Among her special interests on the council were agriculture, education (she was a member of the secretary of state for Scotland's education advisory committee), housing, and welfare. Her work was recognized in 1955 with her appointment as OBE but she eventually left local government for parliament. After unsuccessfully contesting West Stirlingshire (1950, 1951) and Sowerby in Yorkshire (1955), she was finally elected for the Conservative stronghold of Renfrewshire East in October 1959. On 5 May 1960 she married John Francis Penrose Skrimshire MD FRCP (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), a heart specialist and the son of Francis Robert Bradley Skrimshire of the Royal Army Medical Corps. They had no children.<br>
<br>Betty Harvie Anderson (she retained her maiden name) and her husband divided their time between their farmhouse in Worthing, Sussex, and her ancestral estate in Stirlingshire. The interest in wildlife which she developed through her closeness to the countryside led her in 1964 to introduce a successful bill restricting the importation of endangered animals into Britain. Her colleagues twice elected her to the executive of the powerful 1922 committee of Conservative back-benchers: from 1962 to 1970, and again from 1974 until 1979. While her party was in opposition she argued against the Labour government's drastic restructuring of and cutbacks to the armed forces, particularly the Territorial Army, and throughout her career she contributed to debates on Scottish affairs. Her knowledge of Scottish local government resulted in her appointment to the royal commission on local government in Scotland, which sat between 1966 and 1969. The note of reservation which she jointly wrote for the final report, urging separate councils for the three island groups rather than a single council, was adopted by the government and praised as an enlightened acknowledgement of Scotland's regional diversity.<br>
<br>Anderson's activity in parliament earned her a reputation for diligence; she was perhaps motivated by her view that while a second-class woman would lose to a second-class man, a first-class woman could compete with a first-class man. She also believed that women were handicapped by the fact that a decade was required to become established in parliament but during the crucial years needed to launch their careers most women stayed at home with their children. Although she did not support the feminist movement, she made history in July 1970 as the first woman deputy chairman of the ways and means committee, and thus as the first woman deputy speaker of the house. Uncertain whether MPs would accept a woman in the chair, she initially accepted the post on a three-month trial basis, but proved so successful that she was urged to stand for the speakership when it became vacant in 1971. Previous deputy speakers had worn morning suits, but rather than dressing in black and white as expected, she wore stylish yet businesslike clothes with colours chosen to complement the green of the Commons chamber and tailored to withstand lengthy sittings. Contemporaries described her as slight and graceful in stature, &#145;birdlike&#146; in appearance, and brisk but stimulating in conversation. In addition she possessed a firm grasp of parliamentary procedure, which helped her to chair the stormy debates over EEC membership and the <span class="roman">Industrial Relations Act</span>, and a strong belief in the right of individual members to hold the executive to account.<br>
<br>This unswerving belief in parliamentary supremacy and tradition was a factor in Anderson's disagreement with her party's policy on Scottish devolution, which she felt created needless bureaucracy, would facilitate the break-up of the kingdom, and was mistakenly regarded as a panacea for Scotland's problems. In 1968 she led a small group of Conservative MPs in protesting to the party whips against Edward Heath's &#145;declaration of Perth&#146; in support of devolution. Placing principle before career advancement she resigned as deputy speaker in 1973 to argue against a Scottish assembly. In 1975 she declined the Scottish portfolio in the shadow cabinet and helped to form the &#145;keep Britain united&#146; campaign with a small group of tory dissidents.<br>
<br>During the debates of 1977&#150;8 over the <span class="roman">Scotland and Wales Bill</span>, Anderson unsuccessfully moved amendments to exclude the Shetland and Orkney islands from the new assembly's purview, and to postpone the referendum until the entire country could express its opinion at a general election. Before retiring from the House of Commons in May 1979 she witnessed the proposals for a new assembly fail because of the low turnout in the Scottish referendum. Her early stand against devolution no doubt influenced her party's eventual change of policy, and her attainment of the deputy speakership demonstrated without ostentation what women could achieve in politics, thus paving the way for further progress. Shortly after leaving the Commons she was created Baroness Skrimshire of Quarter, but only days after taking her seat in the House of Lords she suffered an asthma attack and died, at Worthing Hospital, Worthing, Sussex, on 7 November 1979. She was survived by her husband.<br>
