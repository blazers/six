<span class="headword">Lambert,  George Jackson</span>  (1794&#150;1880), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, the son of George Lambert, organist of Beverley Minster, was born at Highgate, Beverley, Yorkshire, on 16 November 1794. He had his first lessons from his father, and from the age of sixteen he studied in London under Samuel T. Lyon and William Crotch. In his early career he performed at the Royal Chapel, Chelsea College, and Royal College, Windsor. He also played in the band of the Royal Italian Opera. He was a skilled violin, viola, and cello player, and is said to have became a great favourite of the prince regent. In 1818 Lambert succeeded his father as organist at Beverley, and held the post until 1874, when ill health and deafness compelled him to retire. His father, who died on 15 July 1818, was organist at the minister for forty-one years, according to the epitaph on his tombstone in the graveyard, so that the office of organist at Beverley was held by father and son for the almost unprecedented period of ninety-seven years.<br>
<br>The younger Lambert was an excellent organist and published several compositions, including overtures, instrumental chamber music, organ fugues, and piano pieces. Some quartets and a septet were played at the meetings of the Society of British Musicians but never published. His <span class="italic">Grand quattuor</span> for piano, violin, viola, and cello was played at the fourth concert of the Beverley Musical Society in May 1876; another piece was performed by the Hull Philharmonic Society. Lambert was also a talented artist and painter. He executed cork models of Melrose Abbey, Beverley Minster (which took him seven years), and St Mary's Church, where his sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1830) was organist for some years. He married a sister of J. M. Robinson of Beverley and had two sons, George (<i>d</i>. 1872), who took holy orders, and Henry William (<i>d</i>. 1872), who adopted music as a profession. Lambert's wife predeceased him in 1877. Lambert himself died at Highgate, Beverley, on 24 January 1880, in the same house in which he had been born. His funeral took place at Beverley Minster on 28 January, and he was interred in the private burial-ground in North Bar Street Within.<br>
