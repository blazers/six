<span class="headword">Shepherd,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1805), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, son of Richard Shepherd of Goderthwaite, Cumberland, was born early in January 1759 in Beckermet in Cumberland, and baptized at St Bridget's Church there on 7 January. His parents both died when he was young and his upbringing was entrusted to a guardian, John Benson, of Egremont, Cumberland. In 1783 he was to marry his guardian's niece, Frances Benson. He went to school at Arthuret, near Longtown, and then to university at Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1777, graduated BA in 1781, and proceeded MA in 1787. He took deacon's orders in 1782 and was ordained priest in 1783. In 1785 he was made perpetual curate of Paddington, Middlesex. There he made and renewed several scholarly connections, notably John Boucher, Dr Samuel Glasse, and the Bampton lecturer Dr William Barrow. One of Shepherd's concerns was the adequacy of the church building for, according to a memoir of Shepherd published by his daughter Eliza in 1817, &#145;the old church of Paddington was much too small for the accommodation of so populous a parish; and in a condition so ruinous as to endanger the lives of the few who could attend it&#146;  (Shepherd, 2). Some local opposition notwithstanding, the church was rebuilt through Shepherd's exertions between 1788 and 1791 and consecrated on completion by Beilby Porteus, bishop of London.<br>
<br>In 1797 Shepherd brought out the first volume of his <span class="italic">Critical and Practical Elucidation of the Book of Common Prayer</span>. It was favourably received; the first edition was exhausted before the second was ready for the press. He received many letters of congratulation, including one from George Pretyman Tomline, William Pitt's former tutor and bishop of Lincoln, to whom a later (1817) edition of the <span class="italic">Elucidation</span> was dedicated (the first had been dedicated to Porteus). They did not bring material fortune to the author of the <span class="italic">Elucidations</span>, however, as Shepherd's daughter Eliza noted in her memoir:<blockquote>The general expression of approbation that met his first appearance as Author was the chief if not the only reward of this labour. Habitual inattention to pecuniary concerns, and the too great liberality with which he gave away nearly as many copies as were sold, precluded the possibility of much emolument. (Shepherd, 3)</blockquote>Shepherd had thirteen children and must have hoped for the incumbency of Paddington when it fell vacant with the death of Archdeacon Hayter in 1799; but it had already been promised elsewhere. In the summer of 1801 he was instead offered the curacy of Pattiswick in Essex and still in the London diocese of his patron Porteus, who indeed paid his removal expenses there. He resided nearby at Stisted. His health was not good and the atmosphere apparently not favourable. Two of his daughters predeceased him. His own self-remedial methods of dealing with a cold may have hastened his end. He died at Stisted on 2 May 1805. His body was taken to Paddington for burial in the new churchyard there. At the time of his death he was engaged on a third volume of the <span class="italic">Elucidation</span>, to cover the litany, but it was never published. A fifth edition of the first volume and a fourth of the second appeared in 1836.<br>
