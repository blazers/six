<span class="headword">Ord, Sir  Harry St George</span>  (1819&#150;1885), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, the son of Captain Harry Gough Ord, Royal Artillery, and his wife, Louisa Latham of Bexley, Kent, was born at North Cray, Kent, on 17 June 1819. He was educated privately at Woolwich, and entered the Royal Military Academy there in 1835. He received a commission as second lieutenant in the corps of Royal Engineers on 14 December 1837, and was trained at Chatham. Having been promoted lieutenant on 27 May 1839, he was quartered at Woolwich and afterwards in Ireland. In January 1840 he was sent to the West Indies, where he remained for the next six years. He returned home in December 1845. On 28 May 1846 he married Julia Graham, the daughter of Admiral James Carpenter RN, and on 29 October he was promoted second captain.<br>
<br>In December 1849 Ord was sent on special duty to the west coast of Africa and Ascension Island. Following his return in September 1850 he received the thanks of the Board of Admiralty for his report and recommendations on naval works at Ascension Island. On 1 January 1852 he was appointed adjutant of the Royal Engineers at Chatham. He was promoted first captain on 17 February 1854, but continued as adjutant until July, when he was appointed brigade major of the Royal Engineers under Brigadier-General Harry David Jones in the combined French and English expedition to the Baltic. Ord was present at the siege and capture of Bomarsund, and was mentioned in dispatches. He received the war medal and was promoted brevet major on 8 September 1854. On his return to England he was quartered at Sheerness.<br>
<br>In November 1855 Ord entered the Colonial Office, and until May 1856 served as a commissioner on a special mission to the Gold Coast. From June to October 1856, and again from February to May 1857, he assisted the British minister at The Hague and the British ambassador in Paris in negotiations respecting the Netherlands' and French possessions on the west coast of Africa.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1857 Ord was appointed lieutenant-governor of the island of Dominica in the West Indies. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1859. In April 1860 he accepted the governorship of Bermuda, and assumed the position in March 1861. In January 1864 he returned home on leave of absence, and on 28 November was promoted brevet colonel. He was then sent to the west coast of Africa as commissioner on special service under the Colonial Office in connection with the Asante disturbances. On 9 October 1865 he was made a CB, and the same month he resumed the government of Bermuda, which he finally left in November 1866.<br>
<br>On 5 February 1867 Ord was appointed the first colonial governor of the Straits Settlements, these possessions having previously been administered by the government of India. He was knighted, assumed the government on 1 April 1867, and was promoted major-general on 16 April 1869. His tenure of the government was, by request of the Colonial Office, extended beyond the usual time, and he remained at Singapore until November 1873, continuing to promote colonial trade and financial reforms. His administration was the subject of a court of inquiry after his departure.<br>
<br>Ord's health had suffered from the tropical climate, and for the next four years he remained unemployed. He was made a KCMG in 1877, and was offered the governorship of South Australia, which he declined. However, in November 1877 he became governor of Western Australia. Here he opposed demands for responsible government, and sought, with only limited success, to resolve some of the colony's economic difficulties. Having completed the term of office, he retired on full pension in 1880 and returned to England, where he resided at Fornham House, Fornham St Martin, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The following year he was made a GCMG. He was an honorary fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and presented it with many animals from his various postings.<br>
<br>Ord died suddenly of heart disease at Homburg, Germany, on 20 August 1885. He was buried in the churchyard of Fornham St Martin. A village institute was erected at Fornham St Martin in his memory by his friend the sultan of Johore.<br>
<br>Ord was survived by his three sons: Harry St George, who settled in Australia; William St George, a retired captain of the Royal Engineers, of Fornham; and St John St George, a retired major of the Royal Artillery.<br>
