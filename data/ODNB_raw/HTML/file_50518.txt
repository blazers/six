<span class="headword">Ashton,  Thomas</span>  (1818&#150;1898), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 8 December 1818 at Flowery Fields House, Hyde, Cheshire, sixth child to Thomas Ashton (1775&#150;1845) of Flowery Fields and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Booth. He was educated first at a Liverpool academy and then at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 1838, where he studied chemistry and printing techniques. In 1851 he married Elizabeth Gair (1831&#150;1914), daughter of Samuel Stillman Gair of Rhode Island, USA, and Liverpool. They had nine children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30473/', "Thomas Gair Ashton, first Baron Ashton of Hyde")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38511/', "Margaret Ashton")</script>. Edward Tootal Broadhurst became a son-in-law. The family resided at Flowery Fields House, which formed part of the Ashton Brothers mill complex at Flowery Fields. He had inherited the cotton mills and the merchants' business in Manchester in 1845, and maintained the expansion programme initiated by his father, making the Flowery Fields mills complex the largest industrial concern in the district. The mills were considered to be &#145;The best of their class in the country, thoroughly equipped and conducted with every regard for the comfort and welfare of the operatives&#146;  (Bedford, &#145;Ashtons of Hyde&#146;, 47).<br>
<br>Not only did Thomas carry on the Ashton family tradition he had inherited as an employer&#151;that of an employer who realized his responsibilities to the men and women who worked for him&#151;he improved on it. He enlarged the mill school, built a church at Flowery Fields, and expanded the village built by his father; he also established scholarships at the Hyde Mechanics' Institute and the technical school which enabled students to go to Owens College and to the Manchester Technical School. Care of his employees had always been an important factor to him, and during the cotton famine, when many mills were closed and most employers ruined, Thomas Ashton made sure that his mills never stopped. Ashton's resources were equal to the strain, and in spite of the immense personal and financial loss he kept his workforce in full employment by setting them to work in his brickworks and building a new mill, Throstle Bank mill, an act which resulted in him being presented with &#145;a richly-embellished address&#146; by his workforce expressing their gratitude for the kindness and liberality afforded them on many occasions, but &#145;more especially during the late cotton panic&#146;  (<span class="italic">North Cheshire Herald</span>, 23 May 1866).<br>
<br>Following his move to Ford Bank in Didsbury, Ashton maintained his strong links with the town of Hyde. He took a very active part in local politics, and succeeded in obtaining the charter of incorporation in 1881 for Hyde. He was one of the first radicals elected to Hyde town council, and at the first meeting of the new authority he was elected as alderman and also first mayor of Hyde, in recognition of the &#145;interest he took in the town's welfare and for his many public benefactions&#146;  (Middleton, <span class="italic">History</span>, 266). He also became a figure of note in Manchester society: he funded many projects and was regarded as the second founder of Manchester University; he reconstructed the Hulme Trust which resulted in the establishment of Manchester High School for Girls in 1874. He was also an active member of the Manchester branch of the National Educational League, which did much to prepare the way for the passing of the 1870 act, and he was associated with Lydia Becker in this undertaking. His work on the Hyde Relief Committee was one of the reasons that the city council gave him the freedom of the city in 1892.<br>
<br>As well as his many activities in Hyde and Manchester, Ashton served as high sheriff of Lancashire and also as a magistrate for Cheshire and Lancashire. He was a leading member of the Liberal Party in Manchester, indeed it was commented that he was the Liberal Party in Manchester, but he declined invitations to become a member of parliament. In 1882 he declined a baronetcy offered to him by William Gladstone, who became a close friend and who stayed at his Ford Bank home when he came to Manchester for the National Liberal Federation meeting at the Free Trade Hall in 1889, finding it &#145;refined and pleasant&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 2 Dec 1889).<br>
<br>Ashton died at Ford Bank, Didsbury, on 21 January 1898, and was buried at Hyde Chapel three days later. He is to be remembered as a man who gave his life to the service of high principles and to beneficent labours in his native town of Hyde and his larger home of the city of Manchester&#151;a man who knew he could do most good &#145;dwelling among his own people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 22 Jan 1898) and going among them fulfilling the obligations of neighbourhood and of the employer of labour.<br>
