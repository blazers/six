</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shirley,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1596, <em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, was baptized on 7 September 1596 at St Mary Woolchurch, London, the oldest of five children of James Shirley (1569&#150;1617) and his wife, Catherine. His father and grandfather and their children appear in the same parish records, but there remains little verifiable information about the family; it is likely that they had a small shop. Shirley was enrolled in the Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 4 October 1608. There he gave an average performance until he left, almost certainly on 11 June 1612, though the record is missing. Probably from then until 1614 he worked for the scrivener William Frith.<br>
<br>According to his early biographer, Anthony Wood, Shirley next entered St John's College, Oxford, then presided over by the future archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. Wood retails the anecdote that Dr Laud:<blockquote>had a very great affection for him, especially for the pregnant parts that were visible in him, but then having a broad or large mole upon his left cheek, which some esteemed a deformity, that worthy Doctor would often tell him that he was an unfit Person to take the sacred function upon him. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.260)</blockquote>But Wood's story has never been substantiated. There is a record of Shirley's matriculation at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in Easter term 1615 and of his BA on 4 April 1617. Soon afterwards, on 4 January 1618, his first known poem &#145;Ecco and Narcissus the 2 Unfortunate Lovers&#146; was entered in the Stationers' register. No copy of this remains, although editors agree that it is probably the poem about Narcissus in the 1646 edition of Shirley's poems.<br>
<br>On 2 November 1618 Shirley was guaranteed to succeed as master of the grammar school at St Albans. The following year, on 19 September, he was ordained and, according to Wood, soon afterwards &#145;became a Minister of God's word in, or near to S. <i>Albans</i>&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.260). There is no record as to when Shirley assumed and left the post at the school, but he held it by January 1621 and he was succeeded in January 1625. Meanwhile on 1 June 1618 he had married Elizabeth Gilmet (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1645) of St Albans. Since her father, Richard, served as mayor, and since the mayor&#151;along with the governor of the school, the mayor's brother Robert&#151;controlled the appointment of master of the grammar school, it may be assumed that Shirley was promoted by prominent in-laws. One Shirley daughter was baptized at St Albans on 27 December 1619 and another was born and buried there in 1622.<br>
<br>Wood also claims that about the time Shirley became a schoolmaster he &#145;changed his Religion for that of <i>Rome</i>&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.260). Ever since, most scholars of Shirley except Bas have assumed that Shirley became a Roman Catholic, yet all have confessed that there is little substantive evidence to support this assumption. He could not have converted as early as Wood claimed, since he subscribed to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> in 1617, was ordained an Anglican priest in 1619, and signed a writ of excommunication as priest on 10 November 1623. Moreover, his children were baptized Anglican in the early 1630s, as was his last son in 1641. Finally, on 18 August 1662, four years before his death, he signed assent to the <span class="roman">Bill of Uniformity</span>, which required an oath subscribing to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> from all who preached or taught. It is true that Shirley sought and received patronage in the circle of the queen, Henrietta Maria, a Roman Catholic; but he sought and gained patronage elsewhere as well. Probably he looked for patronage where it was available, among aristocrats estimated for their means, not their faith. Relatively few of his acquaintances were known Catholics, and the rare references in his works to Catholicism are ambiguous, so critics insistent on his Catholicism are reduced to supposition and innuendo.<br>
<br>Wood writes that when Shirley found teaching &#145;uneasie to him, he retired to the <i>Metropolis</i>, lived in <i>Greys</i> inn, and set up for a play-maker&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.261). The birth of his first son, Mathias, was recorded at St Giles Cripplegate on 26 February 1625 and by 1627 the family had moved to Holborn near Gray's Inn, one of the four inns of court, the personal and professional quarters for the legal establishment and their literary coteries. The parish register for St Andrew's, Holborn, records the births of two more sons, Thomas and James, and one more daughter, Mary, between 1628 and 1633, along with their baptisms and the deaths of Thomas and Mary.<h2>
<a name="EarlyLondonstagecareer"></a>Early London stage career</h2>About the time Shirley moved to St Giles, at the age of twenty-eight, his career as a &#145;professional playwright&#146; began. &#145;Professional playwright&#146; designates both one who earned his primary livelihood writing plays for stage companies to produce for paying audiences and one whose craft was perfected through intensive study and extensive use of dramatic techniques proven popular by William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Fletcher, and other forebears. In the Caroline era Shirley and his contemporaries Philip Massinger, John Ford, and Richard Brome were thereby distinguished from courtier playwrights against whom they waged poetic arguments. These gentlemen amateurs generally produced only a play or two during their active years rather than the professional average of two plays per year and relied on the expensive spectacle of elaborate stage machinery and props, rich costumes, intricate music, formal dance, and highly wrought language. Shirley and his peer &#145;professionals&#146; relied more on the craft of traditional dramatic situations, characters, plotting, and language. The professionals occasionally borrowed from each other and honoured each other. Shirley provided commendatory poems for plays by each of the others and received poetic compliments from Massinger and Ford.<br>
<br>Shirley and his professional colleagues wrote for private playhouses. These indoor theatres, which cost about six times more for admission than public theatres, catered to a privileged, typically well-born or wealthy or educated clientele. This audience was generally sophisticated and knowledgeable in its dramatic tastes and it sustained the three playing companies for which Shirley was successively the principal playwright. His dramatic career is thus conveniently divided into the three periods when he wrote for the impresario Christopher Beeston and the company that became Queen Henrietta Maria's Men at the Phoenix or Cockpit in Drury Lane (1625&#150;36), for John Ogilby in Dublin mainly at the St Werburgh Street Theatre, producing plays for the court of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford and lord deputy of Ireland (1636&#150;40), and finally back in London again for the King's Men at Blackfriars (1640&#150;42).<br>
<br>On 11 February 1625 Sir Henry Herbert, the master of the revels, licensed Shirley's first known play, <span class="italic">Love's Tricks, or, The School of Compliment</span>, to be played at the Cockpit under the management of Christopher Beeston. Both titles characterize a play in which a brother and two sisters either make plans for marriage unacceptable to their father or their lover's father, or reject plans imposed on them. A series of pursuits, feints, and confusions of individuals and genders and social stations follows until all ends happily among shepherds in the woods. The play sets a characteristic beginning for Shirley's complicated romance plots, which depend on young lovers managing to come together despite blocking fathers and competing wooers, mistaken identities, manipulations, and confusions among stock characters. The subtitle takes its name from a scene in the middle, a genial satire on characters presuming to climb the social ladder by imitating the manners and language that mark their betters. As <span class="italic">Love's Tricks</span> this first play led to others such as <span class="italic">The Wedding</span> (1626?, published 1629), <span class="italic">The Witty Fair One</span> (1628, published 1633), <span class="italic">The Changes, or, Love in a Maze</span> (1632, published 1632), <span class="italic">Hyde Park</span> (1632, published 1637), <span class="italic">The Bird in a Cage</span> (1633, published 1633), and <span class="italic">The Opportunity</span> (1634, published 1640), all plays that emphasize romantic comedy and display wit. As <span class="italic">The School of Compliment</span> Shirley's first play introduced <span class="italic">The Humorous Courtier</span> (1631, published 1640), and <span class="italic">The Lady of Pleasure</span> (1635, published 1637), plays that focus on mild satire of manners and witlessness.<br>
<br>Shirley's second play licensed for performance was <span class="italic">The Maid's Revenge</span> (9 February 1626) which on publication years later (in 1639) he claimed to be his second tragedy. After this play, which begins like a comedy then abruptly turns deadly, his next tragedy, <span class="italic">Love's Cruelty</span> (1631, published 1640), is also atypical. Whereas his other tragedies are based more in machiavellian court intrigues over power, <span class="italic">Love's Cruelty</span> centres on adulterous and fatal sexual compulsions. <span class="italic">The Traitor</span> (1635, published 1635) is more representative.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Grateful Servant</span> (1629, published 1630) was Shirley's first tragicomedy, a popular kind of play featuring a mixed tone that complicates a tragic situation rising from significant personal and social issues until it achieves a resolution dependent on miracles and charitable forgiveness. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Young Admiral</span> (1633, published 1637), <span class="italic">The Coronation</span> (1635, published 1640), and <span class="italic">The Duke's Mistress</span> (1636, published 1638). All of the plays in this first period were produced by Christopher Beeston companies except for <span class="italic">The Changes</span>, which was produced at the Salisbury Court Theatre, the third of the prestigious private indoor theatres after the King's Men's Blackfriars and Beeston's Cockpit.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Hyde Park</span>, first performed in 1632, featured three polite competitions for women in the setting of a foot race, a horse race, and other gaming activities at the annual spring opening of the fashionable London resort. It is an outstanding representative of Shirley's comedies. The characters are subjected to a series of love tests. One lady demonstrates her enduring fidelity to her long-lost husband. Another resists the seductive wiles of an aristocratic lover until this prodigal reforms. A third beats off the advances of unscrupulous adventurers to achieve union with her gentleman lover who has learned to admire his future wife's qualities in the course of their courtship. The most distinctive trait of <span class="italic">Hyde Park</span> is the mannered language which tests all of the characters for their appropriate status.<br>
<br>Stock characters generally populate Shirley's plays, and are exposed through their language. These include machiavels male and female, misled princes, greedy old men, blunt soldiers, lusty and foolish young suitors, witty gentlemen and even wittier ladies, clever servants, and gullible dupes and clowns. Model characters search for some sort of distinction in manners and language, personal styles that entertainingly adapt but do not violate acceptable social and dramatic roles; occasionally they pledge avowals to virtue. Villains search for inventions to enable them to defraud others; on discovery they confess in long repentances. Satiric characters demonstrate their lack of wit and their failure to advance socially. The traits of all these characters are revealed as much by the style of the language they speak as by their actions. Heroes and heroines are adept at speaking readily, cleverly, and figuratively, what the era called <i>sprezzatura</i>. Villains use debased forms that prove self-undermining, fools use language that is trite, over elaborate, strained, obvious, and lacking in any decorum. All of these characters take time to admire their own successes and applaud or make fun of their fellows.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the first phase, Shirley's dramatic career culminated in the wondrously productive season of 1633&#150;4. His <span class="italic">Young Admiral</span> received Sir Henry Herbert's warmest praise when it was licensed. &#145;Being free from oaths, prophaneness, or obsceanes&#146;, Herbert wrote, &#145;[it] hath given mee much delight and satisfaction in the readinge, and may serve for a patterne to other poetts, not only for the bettring of maners and language, but for the improvement of the quality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dramatic Records</span>, 19). Herbert arranged for a performance for Charles's birthday and reported that the king and queen liked it. The play appeals through extended set speeches that speak of high ideals and the difficult choices facing the hero, appropriately named Vittori, his father, the lady he serves, and the princess of Sicily destined for the prince of Naples, Cesario.<br>
<br>Like most tragicomedies, <span class="italic">The Young Admiral</span> focuses on major concerns of aristocratic adolescents making crucial choices about love and marriage and about the honour of inherited martial status. But unlike tragedies, wherein extreme ambitions and commitments result in disaster, tragicomedies are governed by charitable forgiveness and miraculous conversion; they offer hope. Prince Cesario sets <span class="italic">The Young Admiral</span> in motion through his excessive pride over Naples and his desire for a Neapolitan lady. He has insultingly rejected a Sicilian match, setting off a war. And, risking all, he has pressed his attentions on a lady promised to Admiral Vittori, a man whose naval skills are essential to the survival of Naples. He has wrongfully imprisoned Vittori's father for treason, and locked the gates of Naples against the victorious return of Vittori and the fleet. Through elaborate plot twists, various disguises and missions, and mistaken inferences, Vittori at different times is forced to choose between ideals of loyalty to country, loyalty to family, loyalty to honour, and loyalty to his lady; he faces the prospects of sacrificing his father, his lady, his country, and his own life. Repeatedly choosing self-sacrifice in fidelity to the crown even when wronged and banished, then agreeing in turn to surrender his family and his lady (whom he momentarily mistakes to be unfaithful), he exhibits the honour that makes him a man of true worth. His irascible father, his devoted lady, and the princess of Sicily who loves Cesario also prove their nobility. So does Cesario in a final reconversion. Similar concerns with honour are reflected in a comic tributary plot.<br>
<br>Later that same season, 1633&#150;4, Herbert reported that Charles thought Shirley's <span class="italic">Gamester</span> to be &#145;the best play he had seen for seven years&#146;. This was scarcely a surprise as the play had come from &#145;a plot of the king's&#146; supplied to Shirley by Herbert himself  (<span class="italic">Dramatic Records</span>, 54&#150;5). The play followed shortly after Shirley's production of <span class="italic">The Bird in a Cage</span>. On the title-page of that play (published 1633), Shirley is described as &#145;Servant to Her Majesty&#146;. In it he offered a sarcastic dedication to William Prynne, a counter-attack on Prynne's polemic against the theatre and, perhaps inadvertently, the court, that had cost him his ears.<h2>
<a name="Masquesandmoralinterludes"></a>Masques and moral interludes</h2>In January 1634 Shirley was admitted to membership of Gray's Inn as &#145;one of the Valets of the Chamber of Queen Henrietta Maria&#146;  (Shirley, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, xv). He was commissioned by the inns of court to write the most expensive and elaborate masque of the time as a reconciliatory offering to the king, a presentation on 3 February 1634, that so pleased the royal couple that the king commanded a rare second performance a few days later. <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>, staged by Inigo Jones with music by leading composers William Lawes and Simon Ives, proved to be an enormous success in demonstrating the legal establishment's affection and loyalty to the king, despite the attack of Prynne, a barrister. The king was gratified by the action that depicted him bringing together peace and law in a spirit of justice, and pleased at the support of his reforms expressed in the antimasque scenes. Shirley himself, to judge by his description in the preface to the first edition, was pleased with the rank, quality, and sumptuous attire of his audience.<br>
<br>As Shirley's allegiance to royalism is affirmed in his masque, so his adherence to the established social hierarchy is affirmed in his moral interludes&#151;didactic plays which presented social ethics in allegorical form. The short, early interlude <span class="italic">Contention for Honour and Riches</span> (published in 1633, and later expanded into <span class="italic">Honoria and Mammon</span>, published in 1659) focuses on relationships between the professions and the estates. The interlude features a scholar, a military officer, a courtier, a lawyer, a citizen merchant, and a bumptious country gentleman, all seeking to marry two desirable ladies, Lady Honoria and Lady Mammon. The scholar Alworth gains honour, and Colonel Conquest wins riches. The citizen and countryman show the deferential cowardice supposedly appropriate to their status, and in the interests of the commonwealth those of lesser station accede to the political visionary and state guardian. Meanwhile, the courtier shows promise in diplomacy and the lawyer reforms to promote justice rather than gain. Phantasms of a sick body politic are also portrayed and then dismissed to make way for the prophecy of a sound one.<h2>
<a name="IrishandlateLondonstagecareer"></a>Irish and late London stage career</h2>A period of severe plague that closed the theatres for seventeen months beginning on 12 May 1636 marks Shirley's second period. At the age of forty he moved with John Ogilby, who became master of the revels in Ireland, in the train of the lord deputy. During his four years in Dublin, Shirley not only wrote as many as eight new plays, but also wrote prefaces to the plays of John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton, and others, revised a number of plays for new productions by the St Werburgh Street Theatre, and published sixteen of his earlier plays, or revisions of them, in London. His new plays were mainly comedies, <span class="italic">The Constant Maid</span> (published 1640), <span class="italic">The Royal Master</span> (1638, published 1638), and tragicomedies, <span class="italic">The Doubtful Heir</span> (<span class="italic">Rosania, or, Love's Victory</span>, 1638?, published 1652), and <span class="italic">The Gentleman of Venice</span> (1639, published 1655). They include, however, one tragedy, <span class="italic">The Politician</span> (1639?, published 1655), and the pageant of the early life and miracles of the island's patron saint, <span class="italic">St Patrick for Ireland</span> (published 1640).<br>
<br>The final three years of Shirley's active playwriting career begin with his return to London in April 1640, to the King's Men and Blackfriars after the death of their principal playwright, Philip Massinger. Shirley had staged one tragicomedy, <span class="italic">The Imposture</span> (1640), and one tragedy, <span class="italic">The Cardinal</span> (1641, published 1652), when his last play, the comic <span class="italic">The Sisters</span> (1642, published 1652), appeared on stage before the civil war closed the theatres in 1642. One new tragicomedy, <span class="italic">The Court Secret</span>, was printed in 1653 but not played until the Restoration.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Cardinal</span> is an example of a late revenge tragedy employing a host of elements that characterize a genre popular since Kyd's <span class="italic">The Spanish Tragedy</span> in the 1580s. According to his dedication and preface, Shirley considered it among the best of his plays. Like <span class="italic">The Young Admiral</span>, <span class="italic">The Cardinal</span> focuses on honour and love, but now these are complicated by the passions of revenge. Since the play is founded in a series of vendettas, hell intervenes as well as heaven. Hell comes dressed as heaven in the Cardinal, head of a noble house, favourite of the King of Navarre, and a master machiavel. After the death of the duchess Rosaura's betrothed before consummation of the marriage, the Cardinal persuades the king to arrange her marriage to his nephew, the war hero Columbo, instead of her beloved Count d'Alvarez. When she persuades Columbo, away besieging a city, to release her from the contract, and then weds Alvarez, Columbo returns and&#151;disguised as a player in a wedding masque&#151;assassinates Alvarez. Then the Cardinal protects his nephew while Rosaura seeks revenge. Disguising her intention in cunning madness, she secretly allies herself with Hernando, an insulted colonel, who challenges and kills Columbo in a duel then seeks out the Cardinal, who has been made the protector of the duchess. In the final scene, the Cardinal tries to rape Rosaura, Hernando kills the Cardinal and then himself, and Rosaura is fatally poisoned in a trick devised by the Cardinal.<br>
<br>Shirley employed the tried techniques of revenge tragedy such as a masque murder, a deadly duel, poisoning, multiple intrigues and deceptions, spying, employment of a future lover to avenge a dead one, feigned madness, and multiple killings. He also created a pattern of imagery to complement his themes of arrogant evil and wilful pride among the high born. Both villains and victims are throughout marked by the fire and lightning, storm and fury of their wilful desires, demands, and hatreds. They seek and expect the honour due their station and their political, martial, and amatory skills. Above justice, they relentlessly pursue status and vengeance. The characters' obsession with rank, honour, and revenge is projected in images of purple and red&#151;from the Cardinal's robes to the countess's flushed cheeks. The imagery of violence suffuses this powerful and carefully wrought play.<h2>
<a name="Questforpatronageandpoliticalstance"></a>Quest for patronage and political stance</h2>In disillusioned retrospect Shirley believed that the depletion of &eacute;lite, knowledgeable playgoers was as responsible as the civil war for closing the theatres. In 1640 in his prologue to the production by the King's Men in the Globe, a public theatre, of <span class="italic">Rosania</span>, written for the Dublin private theatre, he expressed consternation. To open &#145;<i>A Prologue at the</i> Globe <i>to his Comedy call'd</i> <span class="roman">The Doubtfull Heire</span>, <i>which should have been presented at the</i> Black-Friers&#146;, he asserts that<blockquote>
<div>Our Author did not calculate his Play,<br>
</div>
<div>For this Meridian; The Bank-side he knowes<br>
</div>
<div>Is far more skilful at the ebbes and flowes<br>
</div>
<div>Of Water then of Wit<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and he admonishes hearers to behave &#145;As you were now in the <i>Black-Friers</i> pit&#146;  (Shirley, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 32). In Ireland in a prologue to <span class="italic">The Toy</span> he had lamented that plays &#145;Ligitimate in Art&#146; were received as stillborn while silly spectacles won applause, even from audiences in private theatres  (ibid., 30). By the prologue to <span class="italic">The Sisters</span>, the last of his plays staged before the closing of the theatres, he was deploring the fact that the King's Men could not draw a crowd for their repertory of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Fletcher, the great names of the English theatre. Thirteen years later, in his dedication (1655) of <span class="italic">The Politician</span> to the honourable Walter Moyle, esquire, he blamed the despised crowds who demanded worthless entertainment for the ban on plays.<br>
<br>From the late 1630s Shirley needed more patronage than before in order to survive, although he was somewhat diffident in applying for it. Some literary historians applaud the apparent indifference to patronage that Shirley expressed in his dedication of <span class="italic">The Maid's Revenge</span> to Henry Osborne in 1639: &#145;I never affected the ways of flattery; some say I have lost my preferment, by not practising that Court sin.&#146; They take as evidence of lost preferment the royal appointment of Sir William Davenant as virtual laureate instead of Shirley, Herbert's censorship of the representations of polite society in the production of <span class="italic">The Ball</span>, Shirley's amiably satiric observations in <span class="italic">The Humorous Courtier</span>, <span class="italic">The Lady of Pleasure</span>, and other works during the early 1630s, and Shirley's move to Ireland. But the record shows that Shirley assiduously sought both ideological and financial support. He had strong social aspirations: the engraving of his bust in the 1659 edition of his <span class="italic">Contention of Ajax and Ulysses</span> exhibits prominently a coat of arms. The Anglican divine Abraham Wright recorded that &#145;I beeleeve [<span class="italic">The Grateful Servant</span> was] purposely so studied by him for to take the court&#146;  (Kirsch, 257). He assiduously sought the favour of the nobility in his dedications. <span class="italic">The Grateful Servant</span> was dedicated in 1630 to the earl of Rutland, the great-grandson of Sir Philip Sidney. In 1637 Shirley dedicated the publication of <span class="italic">The Young Admiral</span> to the learned and wealthy George, Lord Berkeley, and the same year he dedicated <span class="italic">Hyde Park</span> to Henry Hyde, earl of Holland, knight of the Garter, and member of Charles's privy council. In Ireland he dedicated <span class="italic">The Royal Master</span> to the earl of Kildare, the esteemed Irish lord; then he provided for the play a new year epilogue that praised Charles and Charles's lord deputy of Ireland, the earl of Strafford. To Strafford's son Shirley later dedicated <span class="italic">The Court Secret</span>. Other plays he dedicated to worthies who remain only tentatively identifiable by initials and status such as esquire, knight, or baronet. In 1635 Shirley made his most worthwhile dedication, of <span class="italic">The Traitor</span>, to William Cavendish, earl of Newcastle. This patron of Jonson, Ford, and Brome was to become Shirley's primary patron.<br>
<br>In various prefaces, most notably in his introduction to the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio, Shirley commends the power of the poet to present pleasurable and profitable models of ideal courtly conduct for young gentlemen and ladies. Often in the plays he promotes the values of the &eacute;lite, but at the same time he suggests through curative satire the need to correct the failures and abuses of status. That is, he presents both an imitable golden mirror and a critical steel glass. From his first monarch in <span class="italic">The Grateful Servant</span> to his last in <span class="italic">The Court Secret</span> he reaffirms a divine right of kings because loyalty to royalty and nobility appears to be the only alternative to chaos. Shirley's weak or vacillating tragicomic monarchs or tragic misled ones are typically rehabilitated and their vain or machiavellian magistrates blamed.<br>
<br>Repeatedly Shirley presented the related theme of the irrepressible nature of noble blood. In <span class="italic">The Coronation</span>, for example, amid political confusion caused by a machiavellian regent attempting to usurp power, royal scions unaware of their origins demonstrate their true nature by trying to rebel and to take over government, until they are recognized as rightful rulers. Similarly in <span class="italic">The Gentleman of Venice</span>, the son of a wet-nurse exchanged at birth for the true prince shows his base nature despite regal nurture, while the prince shows his regal nature despite nurture as a groundskeeper. Such exchanges and proofs hold true as well for women. In <span class="italic">The Sisters</span> the real daughter Angellina proves noble and wins a prince while her changeling &#145;sister&#146; demonstrates common vanity and social climbing until she is married off to a bandit.<br>
<br>Shirley aims his satire at social and economic climbers. Plays such as <span class="italic">The Opportunity</span>, <span class="italic">The Humorous Courtier</span>, and <span class="italic">The Ball</span> repeatedly demonstrate that while pretenders can ape the manners of their betters, finally their origins and shameful self-seeking will be revealed. The ambitions of all the machiavellian villains of the tragedies, however harmful to others, always destroy their own pretensions to status and honour.<h2>
<a name="RevolutionandRestoration"></a>Revolution and Restoration</h2>After the closing of the theatres, Shirley, in his mid-forties, joined his patron William Cavendish, earl of Newcastle,<blockquote>to take his fortune with him in the wars, for that Count had engaged him so much by his generous liberality towards him, that he thought he could not do a worthier act than to serve him, and so consequently his Prince. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.261)</blockquote>Later Shirley paid a sequestration fine for his military service in the royalist cause from 1642 to 1644. It seems likely that he helped Cavendish write his play <span class="italic">Captain Underwood</span> during this period. &#145;After the Kings cause declined&#146;, writes Wood, Shirley &#145;retired obscurely to <i>London</i>, where, among other of his noted friends, he found <i>Tho. Stanley</i>, Esq&#146;  (ibid., 2.261). He seems to have returned to London and to his family about 1645. His feelings about absence from his wife may well be expressed in his poem &#145;To Odelia&#146;. Shirley now became the poetic centre of a coterie promoted by Thomas Stanley, in which he was able to show his loyalty to the royalist cause during its eclipse. He contributed a poetic commendation to Stanley's <span class="italic">Poems</span> of 1647, an epithalamion for Stanley's wedding in 1648, and a dedication to Stanley's publication of <span class="italic">The Brothers</span> in 1652.<br>
<br>In his poem &#145;On a Black Ribband&#146; Shirley flaunted his fidelity to the royalist cause by speaking of his pride in wearing a black armband as a sign of sympathy with the king's troubles. This poem was published in the 1646 edition of his <span class="italic">Poems</span>, a volume that was fronted by an engraving of the poet by William Marshall, and included verses of cavalier gallantry, songs, prologues, and epilogues from plays, and a masque. Some scholars are inclined to infer from certain lyrics in the volume that Shirley's wife had recently died. In 1647 Shirley was chosen to address readers of the third great folio of English renaissance plays, that of Beaumont and Fletcher. In the troubled time before the execution of Charles I, this folio served to rally the royalists of England with a nostalgic recollection of the theatrical achievements of the Stuart age.<br>
<br>Some time during the period of Stanley's patronage, Shirley resumed his long-interrupted career as a schoolmaster. One consequence of this move was his publication of two Latin grammars, the <span class="italic">Via ad Latinam</span> (1649) and the <span class="italic">Rudiments of Grammar</span> (1656), later expanded. About this time he composed and revised several masques and interludes appropriate for schoolboys. One of these masques was <span class="italic">Cupid and Death</span>, written originally for private performance some time between 1651 and 1653. This masque in a more elaborate form was presented as an entertainment for the Portuguese ambassador who had come to negotiate a treaty of amity with Cromwell's government. Accompanied by fine new music by Matthew Locke and Christopher Gibbons, enlivened by dances by Luke Channen, and fitted out with splendid scenery, <span class="italic">Cupid and Death</span> was performed, probably at Whitehall, on 26 March 1653, an unexpected revival of the masque in Commonwealth England. The action, in which Cupid and Death lodge at the same inn for the night, and their arrows become exchanged, so that thereafter Cupid's targets die and Death's victims become rejuvenated, seems to have been a nostalgic allusion to the old Caroline court world disrupted by the ravages of civil war. The masque was revived for a public performance in 1659.<br>
<br>In the mid-1650s, when he was about sixty years old, Shirley married a widow, Frances Blackburne. The retirement of the schoolteacher was not as complete as Wood averred, however, as Shirley actively published his plays as well as the grammars and masques. The publication of eight unpublished plays began with the important <span class="italic">Six New Playes</span> of 1653 that includes a valuable &#145;Catalogue&#146; that identifies Shirley's plays. After the Restoration Shirley saw a number of his plays reproduced in print and, more importantly, in the repertories of the re-established theatrical companies.<br>
<br>Shirley's end was hastened, in the autumn of 1666, by the great fire of London. Wood records that Shirley and his wife<blockquote>were driven by the dismal conflagration that hapned in <i>London</i> an. 1666, from their habitation near to <i>Fleetstreet</i>, into the Parish of <i>St. Giles in the Fields</i> in <i>Middlesex</i>, where being in a manner overcome with affrightments, disconsolations, and other miseries occasion'd by that fire and their losses, they both died within the compass of a natural day: whereupon their bodies were buried in one grave in the yard belonging to the said church of S. <i>Giles</i> on the 29 of <i>Octob</i>. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.262)</blockquote>In a will the previous July Shirley testified to considerably more wealth than could have been anticipated for a poet and schoolmaster, leaving belongings to his widow, three sons, two daughters and sons-in-law, one grandchild, and several friends.<br>
<br>Shirley's career flowered in the Indian summer of the Caroline stage. During the civil war years and the Commonwealth he struggled to survive, lacking the theatre or suitable patronage, and ill at ease in a republican setting. 1660 brought only a partial restoration of his fortunes, but his works remain a highly expressive record of the fashionable world of late Caroline England. Although his reputation declined&#151;he was charged with dullness by Dryden in <span class="italic">Mac Flecknoe</span>&#151;Shirley's plays continued to be plundered for the stage into the eighteenth century, and they have been republished and read ever since. The hybrid tragicomedy was predominant among new plays when Shirley was writing and its vogue continued throughout the century. Tragedies dominated tastes in the era before Shirley wrote and again in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But it was his social and romantic comedies that were most appreciated in the Caroline era, the Restoration, and again in the last half of the twentieth century.<br>
