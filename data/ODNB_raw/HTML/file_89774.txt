</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Edwards, Sir  George Robert</span>  (1908&#150;2003), <span class="occ">aircraft designer and industrialist</span>, was born on 9 July 1908 at 12 The Parade, Highams Park, Walthamstow, Essex, the son of Edwin George Edwards (1872&#150;1938), a tobacconist and confectioner, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (1872&#150;1908), daughter of Robert Freeman. His mother died shortly after his birth.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlycareer"></a>Education, marriage, and early career</h2>After attending private, preparatory, and council schools, the young Edwards encountered his first test of bureaucracy when the application for him to attend a grammar school was rejected because he was three days too old. Thus he was referred to the Walthamstow Technical Institute Engineering and Trade School which, fortuitously, provided his first introduction to engineering and the entr&eacute;e to a part-time University of London engineering degree course. Spending the first seven years of his professional career from 1928 as a technical engineer in the London docks, he gained a sound practical engineering grounding and election to associate membership of the Institution of Structural Engineers, a professional qualification for which he had studied at the West Ham Municipal College. On 19 October 1935 he married Marjorie Annie (Dinah) Thurgood (1908&#150;1994), a clerk, also from Highams Park, and daughter of John Lawrence Thurgood, clerk. It proved a particularly close and mutually supportive marriage. They had one daughter, Angela (&#145;Dingle&#146;).<br>
<br>Edwards was fortunate to begin his aviation career in 1935 with Vickers (Aviation) Ltd at Weybridge, Surrey, working under the paternal leadership of two of Britain's most accomplished contemporary engineers&#151;Rex Pierson and Barnes Wallis, chief designer and chief structures designer respectively. The first aircraft types on which Edwards worked were Pierson's Air Ministry G4/31 military, general-purpose, biplane and monoplane prototypes that prefaced the long-distance record-breaking, single-engine Wellesley bomber for the Royal Air Force&#151;embodying Wallis's intricate lightweight geodetic (&#145;basketweave&#146;) form of airframe construction. This resulted in his developing an enduring devotion to serving the needs of the RAF throughout the ensuing four decades. He soon became a group leader, and his first main responsibility was the design of the tail unit on the Vickers B9/32 prototype, the forerunner of the prolifically produced and widely deployed Wellington and Warwick twin-engine geodetic bombers of the Second World War.<h2>
<a name="Wartimework"></a>Wartime work</h2>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Edwards was given the responsibility to devise a special version of the Wellington to destroy Hitler's first &#145;secret weapon&#146;&#151;the magnetic mine, which posed such a threat to allied shipping in the Thames estuary. Edwards's solution, a &#145;detonation without impact&#146; device, was visually identifiable by a 48 foot duralumin ring mounted underneath the aircraft, encasing an electromagnetic coil energized by a generator driven by an auxiliary engine inside the fuselage. Charged with the imperative need to get this imaginative concept into service within three months, Edwards had to report progress with photographs every night to the then first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. The device was successfully deployed in the Thames estuary, and later in the Suez Canal, Mediterranean harbours, and the Near East, until the Admiralty had devised its own means of degaussing the hulls of its ships and a highly efficient minesweeping capability.<br>
<br>Edwards's success led to his being appointed to the key position of experimental manager of Vickers-Armstrongs shortly before the devastating bombing raid on the parent Vickers factory at Brooklands on 4 September 1940. As a result of the latter he was given the added responsibility of establishing an autonomous dispersal facility in the nearby, wooded Foxwarren Park. The principal projects with which he was charged were: the construction of the prototypes of the F7/41 &#145;Metal Mosquito&#146; twin-engine, high-speed, high-altitude fighter, Vickers's first stressed-skin aircraft design; the big, four-engine Windsor geodetic bomber; the high-altitude, pressure-cabin Wellington (a British first); the Whittle Wellington jet engine test-bed aircraft; and the prototype of the immediate post-war Viking civil airliner adaptation of the Wellington&#151;as well as the development of Barnes Wallis's bouncing bombs and other special war weapons.<br>
<br>In 1940&#150;41 Edwards undertook an important role in a part-time secondment to Lord Beaverbrook's Ministry of Aircraft Production, working as part of a team of expeditors to accelerate the development and production of new types of British and American aircraft in other British aircraft factories. He was also a member of the Anglo-American Farren mission which sequestrated valuable research information from Germany at the end of the war. Collectively, Edwards's broad range of wartime assignments stood him in a commanding position immediately after the war when Vickers, largely at his instigation, chose wholeheartedly to embrace all-metal, stressed-skin airframe construction and the British-invented gas-turbine engine.<h2>
<a name="Launchingthejetagerevolution"></a>Launching the jet age revolution</h2>When Rex Pierson was made chief engineer of the whole of the Vickers-Armstrongs aviation group (which included Vickers-Supermarine) in September 1945, George Edwards succeeded him as chief designer. Aircraft developed under his technical direction during the next fifteen years included the Vickers Viking, Valetta, Varsity, Viscount, Valiant, Vanguard, VC10, and Super VC10&#151;a family progression that was unique in the western world. In 1953 he was appointed a director, general manager, and chief engineer, before becoming managing director of Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd later that year, following the untimely death of Sir Hew Kilner.<br>
<br>While studying the recommendations of the prescient wartime Brabazon committees for the wholly new civil aircraft types with which British industry should proceed after the war, Pierson had already conceived a metamorphosed Wellington to become the &#145;interim&#146; Viking with which to establish the newly formed British European Airways (BEA). The prototype was first flown on 22 June 1945, only six weeks after VE-day. The Viking began commercial service with BEA on 1 September 1946 and was also adopted by the reconstituted royal flight. The experimental Rolls-Royce pure-jet powered Nene Viking was the world's first airliner to be powered exclusively by jet propulsion. A total of 163 Vikings were built, with some continuing in service until the early 1970s. From the Viking came directly the military Valetta, the RAF's first truly multi-role transport aircraft, of which 263 were built. The Varsity multi-engine flight crew and navigational trainer derivative followed, with 163 being built, the type remaining in service for twenty-five years. The out-turn of the Viking genus thus ran to nearly 600 aircraft, so providing an essential bridge of work in progress until a new-generation airliner could be realized.<br>
<br>Pierson's imaginative response to the Brabazon committees' recommendations for the medium-range European airliner category was the Vickers VC2, powered by four propeller-turbine engines. This resulted in the separate type IIB that Edwards brought to service&#151;with his inspired choice of the Rolls-Royce Dart engine and the first use of a pressurized cabin in a British transport aircraft. Named Viscount, the prototype was first flown on 16 July 1948. It was initially rejected by BEA as being too small, in favour of the &#145;safe option&#146; of the piston-engined Airspeed Ambassador; however, Edwards's unshakeable faith and the staunch support of Sir Hew Kilner at Vickers, Sir Alec Coryton, controller of supplies (air), and Cyril Musgrave, under-secretary (air), at the Ministry of Supply, rescued this evidently promising, if untried, concept from demise and obscurity, to be reborn in enlarged form. Meanwhile the second prototype was adapted for experimental test flying with the Rolls-Royce Tay pure-jet engine and was used by Boulton Paul for the development of electrically signalled, power-actuated flying controls for Edwards's already gestating Valiant V-bomber. It thus became the world's first transport aircraft to fly with such a control system and pioneered the use of &#145;fly-by-wire&#146; controls, later universal in civil and military aircraft.<br>
<br>With support now from Peter Masefield, who took over as chief executive of BEA in 1949, the Viscount 630 prototype operated the world's first turbine-powered airliner scheduled service to carry fare-paying passengers on 29 July 1950&#151;between London and Paris. The airline then began the world's first sustained propeller-turbine airliner service with the enlarged Viscount 701 on 18 April 1953. The real market breakthrough, however, was the acceptance of turbine power with the Viscount in North America&#151;initially with Trans-Canada Airlines and then in the key American domestic market. The sixty-plane order from Capital Airlines of Washington, DC, in 1955 constituted Britain's largest single dollar-earning export order in any field up to that time. Under Edwards's ever determined leadership and drive, 438 Viscounts were sold to more than sixty operators in forty countries&#151;airlines, air forces, governments, corporate businesses, and individual owners&#151;two-thirds of them in valuable export-earning markets. The Viscount dramatically pioneered the benefits of fast, smooth, &#145;over-the-weather&#146;, gas-turbine powered air transport throughout the world.<br>
<br>Most emblematic of George Edwards's prowess as a chief designer and programme leader was the urgently produced &#145;all-electric&#146; four-jet Valiant&#151;the first of the RAF's much vaunted V-bomber nuclear deterrent force of the 1950s and 1960s. It was first flown on 18 May 1951, and 104 were built in record time. Successfully deployed by RAF Bomber Command in the Suez campaign of 1956, the Valiant also live-tested Britain's own nuclear weapons in Australia and at Christmas Island in the Pacific in 1956 and 1957 respectively, pioneered in-flight refuelling for large aircraft in the RAF in 1958, and air-tested the original Bristol Siddeley Pegasus vectored-thrust engine, used in the revolutionary Harrier vertical take-off and landing aircraft.<br>
<br>While the Viscount led to the Vanguard second-generation turboprop airliner, so the Valiant led to the V1000, the world's first large, long-range, non-stop, transatlantic jet transport project. Although, like its American and Russian counterparts, the Vanguard was overtaken by the pure-jets, it notably incorporated large-scale use of integrally machined airframe structural components, a technique which went on to become the principal method of airliner structural design and manufacture on both sides of the Atlantic. The government cancellation of the V1000 in November 1955, due to the extraordinary volte-face of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), six months before the prototype was due to fly, was, Edwards said: &#145;The biggest setback the industry has suffered&#146;  (Edwards, &#145;British aerospace industry&#146;). This left the world market wide open to the American Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, with large US domestic launching orders.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, BOAC again turned to Vickers and Edwards to produce an aircraft specifically capable of meeting the airline's demanding &#145;medium-range empire&#146; routes to Africa and the Far East. His rear-engined, large-area, high-lift, &#145;clean-winged&#146; VC10 and Super VC10 were powered by four Rolls-Royce Conway engines, the world's first dual-flow, &#145;bypass&#146;, or &#145;turbofan&#146; power plant. More than half the weight of the airframe structure was machined from the solid. Although BOAC's still vacillating procurement policies severely truncated the production out-turn to only fifty-four aircraft, the VC10 was the largest aircraft type ever to go into series production in Britain. It was the most popular of all the first-generation big jets and was also adopted by the Royal Air Force, with which a large fleet continued in the strategic transport and aerial refuelling tanker roles for more than forty years.<h2>
<a name="TheBritishAircraftCorporation"></a>The British Aircraft Corporation</h2>When Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd was incorporated in the newly formed British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1960, Edwards initially served as executive director (aircraft) under the founding chairmanship of Lord Portal, the wartime RAF leader, before becoming chairman and managing director of BAC (Operating) and managing director of the main, BAC (Holdings), board in 1963, and chairman of BAC following an internal reconstruction in 1968. He thus had overall responsibility for the development and production of BAC's complete range of civil and military aircraft, guided weapons, and space communications satellite programmes.<br>
<br>Edwards had led the highly advanced Vickers&#150;English Electric TSR2 supersonic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft project from 1958, which was effectively the catalyst of the creation of BAC two years later. The programme was precipitously cancelled by the Labour government in April 1965, just as quantity production was about to begin. This left Edwards with the daunting task of reconstructing the still fledgling industrial grouping. Meanwhile Hunting Aircraft had contributed an imaginative small twin-jet airliner design which Edwards's team at Weybridge evolved into the BAC One&#150;Eleven, the world's first successful &#145;tailored-for-the-job&#146; regional jetliner, which penetrated the American domestic market (just as the Viscount had done) ahead of the home-grown product.<br>
<br>Edwards became a central figure in the conception, technical development, and industrial leadership of the huge collaborative aviation programmes in Europe. The Anglo-French Concorde, the world's first (and at the time of Edwards's death only) successful supersonic airliner, became the foundation of this great new aeronautical venture. He was the original architect of the programme and the only member of the Anglo-French governmental and industrial management team to serve from the signing of the bi-national treaty agreement in November 1962 through to the start of service in January 1976, including bridging the industrial hiatus of the drastic truncation of the programme in the wake of the global oil crisis in 1973&#150;4.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s Edwards was also centrally involved in setting up the Anglo-French Sepecat Jaguar military aircraft programme, leading to the development of a supersonic strike and advanced training aircraft. Then came the Anglo-German-Italian Panavia Tornado, a variable-sweep wing, multi-role combat aircraft, of which nearly 1000 were built for the air forces of the three sponsoring nations and the Saudi air force. In the early 1960s Edwards had already been a prime mover in producing a complete, new, British-manufactured air defence system for Saudi Arabia&#151;including BAC Lightning supersonic fighter and Strikemaster trainer aircraft. This was the most important order ever placed with BAC, leading to further massive orders for British industry in later years.<br>
<br>Edwards retired at the end of 1975 after forty years of involvement in many of the most significant and successful British and world aerospace technical and industrial achievements. He handed over the company in excellent technical and commercial shape, his fifteen-year leadership having enabled it to thrive despite all the political, economic, and technological upheavals that had beset and transformed the aerospace industry worldwide.<h2>
<a name="Honourswiderinterestsandprivatelife"></a>Honours, wider interests, and private life</h2>Appointed MBE in 1945 and CBE in 1952, Edwards was knighted in 1957, in recognition of his leading contribution to the inauguration of the jet age of both civil and military aviation. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 (and awarded its royal medal in 1974), he received eight honorary doctorates and numerous awards. The most significant of his many major national and international honours came in 1971 when the queen bestowed upon him the Order of Merit&#151;the highest honour in the sovereign's personal gift&#151;in recognition of his outstanding contribution to British and world aeronautical engineering.<br>
<br>Complementing his professional life, Edwards always maintained strong and fruitful involvements in the affairs of the principal aeronautical professional bodies on both sides of the Atlantic, most notably the Royal Aeronautical Society. In his presidential year (1957&#150;8) his presidential address presciently and accurately predicted the advent of a supersonic airliner. He was also a leading figure in the foundation of the University of Surrey, of which he became the first pro-chancellor, in 1966; in the formation of the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon; as patron of the Brooklands Museum Trust; and as a deputy lieutenant of the county of Surrey.<br>
<br>Always leading a balanced personal life with proper time and regard for his family and personal interest and pursuits, Edwards particularly enjoyed cricket and painting, which continued to be the twin staples of his twenty-seven-year retirement. The former had early led him to recommend that the critically enabling &#145;back-spin&#146; be applied to Barnes Wallis's &#145;dambusting&#146; bombs to achieve the sustained bouncing effect which proved so decisive in May 1943. His talent for painting was rewarded with a winning framing in the Royal Academy summer exhibition in London in 2000. The bedrock of his personal life was his fifty-nine-year marriage to Dinah, and in retirement he took great pleasure in his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.<br>
<br>Humanity, compassion, and unfailing good humour made Edwards an exceptionally well-rounded man with a legion of friends. He was able to relate with equanimity to everyone within his exceptionally wide compass&#151;from his immediate associates through to the monarch. He died at his home of more than thirty-five years, Albury Heights, White Lane, Guildford, Surrey, on 2 March 2003, of bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular disease; his funeral was on the 10th at St Martha on the Hill, Guildford. He was survived by his daughter, Angela, his wife having predeceased him.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>One of the most outstanding figures in the development of the global aerospace industry, Edwards&#151;affectionately known to his professional colleagues simply as GRE&#151;was the most widely accomplished and highly regarded British aircraft designer and industrial leader after the original pioneers, and of world stature. Entering the industry in 1935 at the dawn of the technological revolution from the biplane to the monoplane, his forty-year aviation career embraced not only his profound contribution to aircraft design but also the leadership and direction of British industry in the jet age, through large-scale domestic and European industrial integration and collaboration, and into the supersonic era. He played a key role in the generation of leading-edge technologies and standards, the realization of a whole new travel experience throughout the world by air, and key elements of national and international defence. In turn, this resulted in the provision of many thousands of high-calibre and rewarding jobs, and hugely valuable commercial and export benefits for Britain.<br>
<br>Edwards's career spanned some of the most demanding situations in British and world affairs, in which the aeronautical industry&#151;with its inseparable sibling, defence&#151;was always a crucially important dynamic. It ranged from the large-scale re-equipment and expansion of the Royal Air Force to meet the huge demands of the Second World War, through the pioneering launch of the jet age in the immediate post-war period, to the reshaping of the British and European aviation industries in the 1960s and 1970s. Edwards played an important part in each of these developments. Simultaneously his many seminal papers delivered to leading professional organizations on both sides of the Atlantic, and in the academic domain that he did so much to foster, were also influential and appreciated.<br>
<br>Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh, perhaps best summed up Edwards's outstanding aeronautical career at the time of the latter's retirement when he said: &#145;Sir George Edwards is one of those exceptional men who have stamped their genius on the course of events. His achievements have earned him a place among the great company of pioneers and innovators of World aviation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Airframe</span>). A man of enormous ability and resolve, he was able to comprehend and realize some of the largest and most complex engineering industrial undertakings of the time. Consistently contesting powerful competition and the ever present dichotomy of reconciling the short-term objectives of the political system with the long-term ones of the aerospace business, he was always sustained by his iron will and simplistic motto: &#145;Never give up&#146;.<br>
