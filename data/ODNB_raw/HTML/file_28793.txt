<span class="headword">Warren,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1617&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, matriculated as a sizar from St Catharine's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1634, as of Suffolk, graduated BA in 1638 and proceeded MA in 1641. On 1 January 1647 he was admitted to the rectory of Houghton, Hampshire, though his formal presentation under the great seal took place on 6 February 1651 following its cession by the sequestered rector. From Houghton in April 1654 he issued <span class="italic">Unbeleevers No Subjects of Justification</span>, directed against the work of William Eyre (<i>d</i>. 1670), the curate of St Thomas's, Salisbury, and dedicated to the mayor, aldermen, and common councillors of Salisbury. Following the Restoration, Warren was on 19 July 1660 presented by the crown to the Houghton rectory, and on 22 December he was ordained deacon and priest in Scotland by the bishop of Galloway, Thomas Sydserff. Instituted on 1 February 1661 to his rectory by Bishop Brian Duppa, he was ejected under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662 and a successor was collated soon after, on 23 September. According to his papers, Warren was offered a choice of the bishoprics of Salisbury and Winchester if he should conform.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Warren married Elizabeth, with whom he had three sons and four daughters. She was buried at Romsey, probably the couple's home during the early years of the Restoration. His second marriage, by licence of 10 July 1667, was to Mary Evans, aged forty-five, of St Mary Savoy, London. On 25 July 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian preacher at the house of Clement Warren of Romsey, probably the mercer of that name later designated an executor. He is reported to have had doubts about taking advantage of James II's declaration of indulgence in 1687. In later years, he became almost blind, and the Common Fund of the Presbyterian and Independent ministers granted him &pound;6 a year between 1690 and 1693. Warren was listed as one of the Hampshire preachers in the winter of 1690&#150;91, &#145;an ancient and learned man as any in ye county 70 years old&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 512). In his will dated from Romsey on 13 April 1693 and 25 January 1694 Warren mentioned a third wife, Hannah, and disposed of property at Andover. He died on 27 January 1694, aged seventy-seven or in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried at Romsey Abbey.<br>
