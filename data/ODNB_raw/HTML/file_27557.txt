<span class="headword">Topsell,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1572, <em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Sevenoaks, Kent, and was baptized there on 3 February 1572, the son of John Topsell (<i>d</i>. 1573). He matriculated as a sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1587, graduated BA in 1591 or 1592, and probably proceeded MA, though there is no record of this. He held a variety of cures and livings in Sussex (Hartsfield, 1592; Framfield, 1593&#150;6; East Hoathly, 1596&#150;8; Mayfield, 1605&#150;6; East Grinstead, 1610&#150;15), Hertfordshire (Datchworth, 1598&#150;1601), and Northamptonshire (Syresham, 1602&#150;8). The name of his first wife is not known, but a daughter, Mary, was baptized at Datchworth in 1600 and a son, Abel, matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1617, aged fifteen; both survived him. From 7 April 1604 Topsell was perpetual curate of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, and on 12 August 1612 he married Mary, widow of Gregory Seaton, stationer, of the adjacent parish of St Anne and St Agnes.<br>
<br>Topsell's early publication <span class="italic">The Reward of Religion: Delivered in Sundrie Lectures upon the Booke of Ruth</span> (London, John Windell, 1596) is addressed to Margaret, Lady Dacre of the South, whose husband, Sampson Lennard of Chevening, promoted his early studies. The book reflects upon marriage and duty; it was reissued in 1601 and in 1613. <span class="italic">Time's Lamentation, or, An Exposition of the Prophet Joel in Sundry [42] Sermons or Meditations</span> (London, by E. Bollifant for G. Potter, 1599), dedicated to Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy (described by Topsell as &#145;the meane of my preferment&#146;), condemns &#145;vanity and frivolity&#146;, that is, worldly preoccupations of all kinds. Topsell warns his audience not to doubt plagues or grow impatient at these tales of &#145;a muster of fraybugs, and little worms an inch long&#146;; we must not &#145;weigh [such matters] in the ballance of natural reason but lay them to a sound spirituall judgement. The waies of God are not like the waies of men&#146;  (p. 68). The same note is struck in <span class="italic">The Householder, or, Perfect Man: Preached in Three Sermons</span> (London, by Henry Rockyt, 1610, 16mo), addressed to Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset, his wife, Anne, and to four other noblemen of Topsell's acquaintance.<br>
<br>Insistence upon a spiritual reading of the book of nature is to be found prominently in the prefatory material, and less prominently in the text, of Topsell's most celebrated publications, <span class="italic">The Historie of Foure-Footed Beastes</span> (London, W. Jaggard, 1607) and <span class="italic">The Historie of Serpents</span> (London, W. Jaggard, 1608), both dedicated to Richard Neile, dean of Westminster. Topsell's declared purpose in collecting together pictures of animals, and stories about their ways, is to entertain, to inform, and above all to edify. He envisages <span class="italic">The Historie of Foure-Footed Beastes</span> as suitable sabbath reading-matter in the godly home (epistle dedicatory, final paragraph). These books have usually been seen, and criticized, as contributions to natural history&#151;indeed, it was in this light that they were reissued by John Rowland, together with Thomas Mouffet's <span class="italic">History of Insects</span>, in 1658. But Topsell made no claim to be a naturalist. He was an industrious compiler, collecting information out of &#145;divine Scriptures, fathers, Philosophers, Physitians and Poets&#146; amplified with &#145;sundry accidental Histories, Hierogliphycks, Epigrams, Emblems, and Aenigmatical Observations&#146;. He relied heavily on the <span class="italic">Historia animalium</span> of the mid-sixteenth-century Swiss protestant encyclopaedist Conrad Gesner, from whose work most of the text and the pictures in both books is derived. He reproduces much of Gesner's text verbatim, but also paraphrases, digests, or omits passages without warning. He adds material from the English writers John Caius (on dogs), Thomas Blundeville and Gervase Markham (on the horse), and Thomas Penny via Thomas Mouffet (on insects), as well as remarks of his own.<br>
<br>Topsell has rightly been judged to have been &#145;a man of very little originality, who reproduced what his authorities gave to him&#146;, and who was guilty on occasion of blurring the distinction between citation and commentary, in such a way as to lay himself open to the charge of plagiarism  (Raven, 218, 167, 223&#150;6). His work is ignored by the later seventeenth-century naturalist John Ray. When Topsell and the printer William Jaggard collaborated on the <span class="italic">Foure-Footed Beastes</span> it was, no doubt, on the assumption that &#145;there was a public ready to enjoy and able to pay for large illustrated books of this kind&#146;  (Raven, 218). That this public was ready to complain about printers' errors was perhaps an unwelcome surprise. In his preface to <span class="italic">The Historie of Serpents</span> Topsell apologizes for the shortcomings of the first volume, and explains that neither he nor the printer could afford to pay for a scholarly proof-corrector. Clearly, the project had proved to be both expensive and difficult. Signs of haste, and perhaps of boredom, are evident already in the book on serpents. Despite the fact that Topsell lived on for another twenty years, the intended volumes on birds and fishes never appeared. He died, probably in London, in 1625, and was buried at St Botolph.<br>
