<span class="headword">Lockwood,  Richard Evison <span class="st"> [Dicky]</span></span>  (1867&#150;1915), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born at Summer Hall, Crigglestone, near Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 9 November 1867, the son of Benjamin Lockwood, a general labourer and groom, and his wife, Mary Evison. He made his d&eacute;but as a right wing three-quarter for Dewsbury at the age of sixteen in 1884 and rapidly established himself as a sporting phenomenon. He played for Yorkshire and England at nineteen&#151;he made the first of fourteen appearances for his country in 1887&#151;and rose to captain the English rugby union side in 1894, the first player without a public-school background to do so.<br>
<br>Known as &#145;the Little Tyke&#146; and &#145;Little Dick, the World's Wonder&#146;, partly because of his age and also because of his diminutive stature&#151;he was only 5 feet 4&frac12; inches tall&#151;Lockwood was brilliant in attack and deadly in the tackle, with a knack of being in the right place at the right time. An astute tactician, he was responsible for introducing the Welsh-originated four three-quarter system into the Yorkshire county team and for popularizing the tactic of running after the ball after punting it in order to put his forwards onside.<br>
<br>No player was as famous in northern rugby nor so symbolized the rise of the working-class player as Lockwood. He was employed as a woollen printer in a textile factory when he married on 2 February 1889, at the Wesleyan Centenary Chapel, Dewsbury, Sarah Grace Taylor, the daughter of a blanket raiser. That year he transferred to the Heckmondwike club, who paid him, it later emerged, &pound;1 per game, contrary to rugby's amateur regulations. Although the club was suspended for professionalism by the Yorkshire Rugby Union, he survived two investigations of the same charge, much to the relief of an adoring public, as <span class="italic">The Yorkshireman</span> (18 September 1889) magazine described: &#145;the news of his acquittal was received with an outburst of cheering, the gathering in all respects resembling those witnessed at an exciting political election.&#146;<br>
<br>If the feelings of Lockwood's supporters were unambiguous, the same could not be said for those of the rugby union authorities. He was continuously passed over for the Yorkshire captaincy in the early 1890s. And, despite the fact that he had captained England earlier in the season, he was barred by the Rugby Football Union in 1894 from playing in a club match after he had withdrawn from the Anglo-Scottish match because he couldn't afford to take time off work. This added to calls for payments for &#145;broken time&#146; to working-class players, the issue over which rugby would split in 1895. A few weeks after the 1895 rugby schism, Lockwood joined Wakefield Trinity in the Northern Union (later the Rugby League). In 1900 his career turned full circle, however, as he returned to Dewsbury, and in 1903 he retired.<br>
<br>Sadly, Lockwood was unable to translate his football fame into material wealth. He gave up his factory job to run the Queen's Hotel pub in Heckmondwike during the 1890s, but was declared bankrupt in 1897, and was forced to sell all his household furniture and return to manual work. On 10 November 1915 he died in Leeds Infirmary, shortly before he was due to have a second operation for cancer; he was buried in Wakefield cemetery four days later. His wife and four children survived him.<br>
