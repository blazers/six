<span class="headword">Brackenbury,  Hannah</span>  (1795&#150;1873), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born at Leyland, Lancashire, on 17 November 1795, second of the three surviving children of Francis Brackenbury and his wife, Sarah Blackledge. Nothing else is known of her life until 1844, when she moved from Manchester to Hove, accompanied by her ailing brother, James Blackledge Brackenbury (1793&#150;1844), with whom she had been living. He had made a fortune as a solicitor working for railway pioneers. He died at Hove on 31 October 1844, apparently a widower. When his only child, Harriette Mary Brackenbury (1833&#150;1861), and his bachelor brother Ralph Brackenbury (1797&#150;1864) died, the family money converged on Hannah Brackenbury. Publicly, she was the &#145;last in lineal descent of the ancient family of Brakenbury of Denton and Sellaby in the County of Durham&#146;. Privately, she was more diffident. Robert Surtees (1779&#150;1834) had worked out a pedigree for this family from 1222 to 1677, but he could not trace later descendants. Her father was probably the Francis Brackenbury born in 1769 who is mentioned by Surtees as a member of a yeomanly cadet branch which flourished near Richmond, Yorkshire, in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1865 Hannah Brackenbury had an income of about &pound;7000 per annum. She distributed about &pound;100,000 in philanthropy between 1865 and 1872. William Henry Rooper (formerly incumbent of St Andrew's Church, Hove, which she attended) was an influential adviser, and so was Edward Lewis, J. B. Brackenbury's partner. Rooper was her agent in correspondence with Robert Scott, master of Balliol College, Oxford, which led (1865&#150;72) to her endowment of eight Brackenbury scholarships at the college. She wanted to help students with ambitions in law or medicine, the professions of her brothers, and was persuaded that history and natural science were the appropriate foundations. Balliol was chosen because she believed that her medieval ancestors had been closely involved with the Balliol family. In fact, the only clear Balliol&#150;Brackenbury connection is the Brackenbury tower of Barnard Castle, the main Balliol seat in England. This led Scott to joke that she might like to build a Brackenbury tower at Balliol. She took this bait, and eventually paid for most of the reconstruction of the Balliol Broad Street front (1867&#150;8). She also established six Brackenbury scholarships at Manchester grammar school.<br>
<br>Although in precarious health, Hannah Brackenbury was still a firmset, strong-looking woman, and in vigorous possession of her faculties; Rooper did not find her an easy person to direct or to keep to her intentions. From late 1868 she usually dropped the c in her surname, apparently thinking the spelling Brakenbury more authentic. In 1869 the Brakenbury mortuary chapel was attached to the church of St Nicolas, Portslade, at her expense, and she paid for new school buildings which were opened nearby in 1872. In her lifetime she was also a major benefactor to Owens College, Manchester (mostly for medicine), to Richmond School, Yorkshire (for Brackenbury scholarships), and to the Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary in Manchester (for the first Ancoats Hospital building with beds).<br>
<br>Hannah Brackenbury died at home (31 Queen Adelaide Crescent, Hove), of heart failure after a short illness, on 28 February 1873, and was interred on 7 March in the vault beneath the Brakenbury Chapel. Probate was granted based on a valuation under &pound;160,000. Her lengthy will made provision for her housekeeper-companion Alice King; there were bequests for many friends and their children; the University of Durham received &pound;9000 for professorships; but the greater part of her estate was distributed among numerous hospitals, asylums, and charities (mostly medical).<br>
