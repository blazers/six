<span class="headword">Crouse,  John</span>  (1737/8&#150;1796), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, was the son of William Henry Crouse (<i>d</i>. 1804) of Norwich, theatre proprietor and comedian, and his wife, Esther. William Crouse held one of the twenty-eight shares in the Theatre Royal, Norwich, where he and Esther were managers of the theatre wardrobe. On 20 April 1752 John was apprenticed to the Norwich printer and bookseller William Chase, son of the printer and local politician, also William (1692&#150;1744). In July 1760 Crouse bought the stock of the local bookseller Robert Goodman and set up his own business at the Bible and Star in Cockey Lane, Norwich. In the following year, on 18 July, he began his first newspaper, the <span class="italic">Norwich Gazette</span>, which enjoyed only moderate success. On 6 March 1763 he was admitted to the freedom of Norwich and, three years later, he opened a printing office over Lewis's warehouse, Upper Market Place. On 14 December 1768 it was agreed that Crouse and William Chase were, on alternate months, to supply all printing materials to the town's Theatre Royal. Several months later, on 8 April 1769, Crouse began a new newspaper, the <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, which was distributed throughout the county. In addition to this title he printed an extensive number of books, some incorporating maps, including Robert Potter's translation <span class="italic">The Tragedies of Aeschylus</span> (1777). This volume had an impressive list of over 550 subscribers, an indication of Crouse's standing in the printing trade.<br>
<br>In the next decade Crouse became a major contractor for the Norwich to London mail coach (the second mail coach, introduced on 28 March 1785) to run from the King's Head in the town's market place. To Crouse goes the credit of publishing the first point-to-point timetable in Britain  (<span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, 16 April 1785). This detailed the mail coach routes&#151;one via Colchester, the other via Newmarket&#151;from London to Norwich, with all the horse posts connected to the new service. In the same year Crouse took as a partner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26442/', "William Stevenson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26439/', "Stevenson, Seth William")</script>], who helped him to run his &#145;medicinal warehouse&#146; in the market place. Stevenson admired Crouse for his integrity, generosity, and goodness of heart. The partnership was enlarged at the end of September 1794 to include Chase's relative Jonathan Matchett (<i>c</i>.1771&#150;1844) and was renamed Crouse, Stevenson, and Matchett. Between 1794 and 1796 the firm printed posters detailing &#145;Mail coaches; Hambro [Hamburg], Yarmouth, Norwich etc&#146;, announcing through-running to &#145;Hambro&#146; by packet.<br>
<br>It is debatable which is Crouse's most important work. The <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span> became a major journalistic force in the county and survived until 1955. His tabulated timetable became the standard format for road and, later, rail transport, replacing the old stagecoach maxim &#145;if God permits&#146; with minute-by-minute timing. Crouse was unmarried, though his &#145;reputed daughter&#146;, Esther Bowyer Crouse, was living with him in 1796. He became seriously ill in September of that year and died on 18 November 1796, aged fifty-eight. Crouse was buried at St Peter Mancroft Church, Norwich, on 24 November.<br>
