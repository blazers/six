<span class="headword">Pennant,  Richard</span>, Baron Penrhyn  (<em>c.</em>1737&#150;1808), <span class="occ">slate manufacturer and politician</span>, was the second son of John Pennant (<i>d</i>. 1782), merchant, and his wife, Bonella Hodges (<i>d</i>. 1763), who were resident in Jamaica. His father was descended from Thomas Pennant, the fifteenth-century abbot of Basingwerk, and both parents had inherited substantial plantations in Jamaica, including those of Sir Samuel Pennant (<i>d</i>. 1750), who became lord mayor of London in 1749. John and Bonella Pennant went to London about 1737 and had a house in Savile Row, Hanover Square. Richard was probably born either there or at sea. He and his elder brother, John Lewis Pennant, attended Newcome's academy, Hackney, and were admitted as fellow commoners at Trinity College, Cambridge, at Easter 1754; John Pennant died later in the year. Richard did not graduate, but on 29 March 1758 he became a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, founded in 1754.<br>
<br>By his marriage to Anne Susannah Warburton (1745&#150;1816) on 6 December 1765 in Bath Abbey, Pennant acquired the Penrhyn estate in Caernarvonshire. Anne's maternal grandfather was Dr Edward Norris, MP for Liverpool from 1714 to 1722, and her family had influential connections in the borough, which aided her husband's political career. Her paternal grandmother, Anne, was the daughter of Sir Robert Williams (<i>d</i>. 1680), the last of the male heirs in line from John Williams, archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1650); Sir Robert had purchased the Penrhyn estate, which passed to Anne Williams conjointly with her sister, Gwen. Anne married Thomas Warburton of Winnington, Cheshire, and Gwen married Sir Walter Yonge of Escot, Devon. General Hugh Warburton (1695&#150;1771) was the son of Anne and Thomas Warburton, and Anne Susannah was his only child and heir. In 1771, on the death of his father-in-law, General Warburton, Pennant took over Winnington Hall and the moiety of the Penrhyn estate. In 1785 he bought the remainder of the estate from Sir George Yonge, grandson of Gwen and Walter Yonge. The tenants at Cae Braich y Cafn, later the Penrhyn quarry, were paid a lump sum in 1783 in exchange for their right to take slates.<br>
<br>Richard's political career began in 1761, when as a whig he became MP for Petersfield, Hampshire. In 1767 he became one of the two MPs for Liverpool, the chief port of the slave trade. He was re-elected in 1768 and 1774, aided by his wife, whose talents as a canvasser were renowned. Richard spoke in the Commons to oppose the introduction of taxation in America, on 29 January 1769, and on 19 April 1774 he seconded the motion for the repeal of the tea duty; as the proprietor of extensive plantations in Jamaica he was well aware of the economic damage a war with America would bring. In 1780 he was defeated at Liverpool and in 1782 he became sheriff of Caernarvonshire. In 1783, on the recommendation of Charles Fox, he was created Baron Penrhyn in the peerage of Ireland. On 18 April 1785 he voted for the reform of parliament. In the election of 1784 he had narrowly defeated Colonel Tarleton, but in 1790 he withdrew as a candidate, expressing his unease at the election process.<br>
<br>In 1787 William Wilberforce promoted the campaign for the abolition of slavery, which Lord Penrhyn opposed. On 9 May 1788 Penrhyn spoke in a debate in the House of Commons in defence of both the slave-traders and the planters, and between 1789 and 1791 committees of inquiry were set up by parliament and by the assembly and council of Jamaica. Lord Penrhyn was an absentee landlord but he kept closely in touch by letter with his plantation attorneys. He failed to appreciate the degradation caused by slavery, but he did express concern about the condition of his slaves. In 1782 he sent out ploughs to ease conditions for the workers, and he frequently remarked that he did not wish &#145;the negroes and cattle to be overworked&#146;. When the abolition of the slave trade became law in 1807, Lord Penrhyn regarded it as a dangerous experiment which would bring ruin to the Jamaican economy.<br>
<br>The profits from the Jamaican sugar and rum trade were used to expand the production and export of slates from Lord Penrhyn's quarry in Caernarvonshire. By 1790, having obtained a lease from the bishop of Bangor, Penrhyn had converted the mouth of the River Cegin into a harbour, called Port Penrhyn, from which slates were sent to London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Ireland. Framed writing-slates, manufactured at Port Penrhyn, were included in the ships' cargoes. Benjamin Wyatt (1745&#150;1818), the Staffordshire architect, designed the port, and in 1782 his brother Samuel Wyatt remodelled the medieval Penrhyn Hall. In 1789 a cart road was built from Port Penrhyn to the quarry, and by 1800 this had been extended through Nant Ffrancon to Capel Curig. Such enterprises, together with his promotion of improvements in agriculture, earned Lord Penrhyn much praise as a benefactor to the community from contemporaries such as W. Bingley in <span class="italic">Excursions in North Wales</span> (1798) and from historians such as Richard Llwyd, who, in <span class="italic">The History of Wales</span> (1832), described the transformation as &#145;a new creation&#146; of the neighbourhood.<br>
<br>In 1794 parliament imposed a tax of 20 per cent on all slate carried coastwise, and with falling profits from Jamaica, business survival became difficult. A tax was imposed on horses in 1797, and in 1800 work began on a horse-drawn railroad from Penrhyn quarry to Port Penrhyn, which gave employment to redundant quarrymen. The line was planned by Benjamin Wyatt on the basis of suggestions by Thomas Dadford; it was 6&frac14; miles long, had a gauge of 24&frac12; inches, and was officially opened by Lord Penrhyn on 1 July 1801. William Williams (1738&#150;1817) began the excavation of galleries at the quarry, and this work was continued after 1802 by James Greenfield (1774&#150;1825). Having secured a grant from the crown in 1784, which enabled him to make enclosures on Llandyg&aacute;i Common, Lord Penrhyn built the &#145;model village&#146; of Llandyg&aacute;i nearby. St Tegai's Church in the village contains a monument to Lord and Lady Penrhyn, sculpted by Richard Westmacott, for which Lady Penrhyn left &pound;2000 in her will.<br>
<br>Lord Penrhyn died on 21 January 1808 at Winnington Hall, Cheshire, but was buried in a vault at St Tegai's Church. He was survived by his wife, but they had no children, and the title became extinct. By Penrhyn's will the estates passed to George Hay Dawkins, the second son of his cousin, Henry Dawkins, who added the surname Pennant to his own. Lord Penrhyn left debts of &pound;150,000, to be paid, according to his will, out of the proceeds of the sale of the Jamaican properties. In 1808, however, these could not be sold for anything like the amount required. Winnington Hall was sold, a mortgage was raised on the Penrhyn estate, and the debts were paid off in October 1808. After the death of George Hay Dawkins-Pennant in 1840, the estates were inherited by his son-in-law, Edward Gordon Douglas (1800&#150;1886), who added the name Pennant to his own in 1841, and was created Baron Penrhyn of Llandyg&aacute;i in 1866.<br>
