<span class="headword">Hatton,  George William  Finch-</span>, tenth earl of Winchilsea and fifth earl of Nottingham  (1791&#150;1858), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Kirby, Northamptonshire, on 22 May 1791. He was a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9446/', "Edward Finch-Hatton")</script>, and son of George Finch-Hatton (1747&#150;1823) of Eastwell Park, near Ashford, Kent, MP for Rochester in 1772&#150;84, and his wife (whom he married in 1785), Elizabeth Mary (<i>d</i>. 1825), eldest daughter of David Murray, second earl of Mansfield. George William, who had one younger brother and three sisters, was educated at Westminster School and at Christ's College, Cambridge (BA, 1812). In 1809 he became a captain in the Ashford regiment of the Kentish local militia; in 1819 began acting as a lieutenant of the Northamptonshire regiment of yeomanry; and in 1820 was named a deputy lieutenant for the county of Kent. On 2 August 1826, on the death (without legitimate issue) of his cousin, George Finch, ninth earl of Winchilsea, and fourth earl of Nottingham, he succeeded to these peerages.<br>
<br>Winchilsea was tall, well-built, and black-haired, and in his prime was an imposing figure and an inspiring orator. His integrity and sincerity impressed his contemporaries. He presided at a very large and influential meeting held on Penenden heath, Kent, on 10 October 1828, when strongly worded resolutions in favour of protestant principles were carried. In his place in the House of Lords he was a very frequent speaker and vigorously defended the protestant tory cause. He was particularly noted as being almost the only English nobleman who was willing to identify himself with the Orange party in Ireland, and he was accustomed to denounce in forceful terms Daniel O'Connell and Maynooth College and its system of education. Occasionally he took the chair at May meetings at Exeter Hall, but his protestantism was more political than spiritual and he did not become a leader of evangelicalism.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> of 1829 aroused Winchilsea's most vehement hostility, and led him to fight a duel with the duke of Wellington. In a published letter he wrote that the duke, &#145;under the cloak of some outward show of zeal for the Protestant religion&#146;, had carried on &#145;insidious designs for the infringement of our liberties, and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State&#146;. The duke asked for an apology, and, when this was not forthcoming, demanded satisfaction. The meeting took place in Battersea Fields on 21 March 1829, the duke being attended by Sir Henry Hardinge, and his opponent by Edward Boscawen, Viscount Falmouth. The duke fired and missed, whereupon Winchilsea fired in the air and then apologized for the language of his letter  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1829, 58&#150;63).<br>
<br>In November 1830 Winchilsea was a leading figure in the ultra-tory rebellion which led to the downfall of the Wellington government. At this time he professed himself favourable to moderate reform, but in June 1831 he withdrew his support from Earl Grey's administration  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 4.107&#150;11) and subsequently strenuously opposed the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and other whig measures. He was gazetted lieutenant-colonel commandant of the East Kent regiment of yeomanry in 1830, named a deputy lieutenant for the county of Lincoln in 1831, and created a DCL of Oxford on the occasion of Wellington's installation as chancellor of the university in 1834. His protestant convictions continued undimmed in later life, and in 1851, in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he denounced the new Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Russell administration's half-hearted response to it.<br>
<br>Winchilsea was married three times: first, on 26 July 1814, to Lady Georgiana Charlotte, eldest daughter of James Graham, third duke of Montrose. An &#145;earnest disciple of the Evangelical school of her day&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>), she died, leaving a son and a daughter, at Haverholme Priory on 13 February 1835. His second wife, whom he married on 15 February 1837, was Emily Georgiana, second daughter of Sir Charles Bagot GCB; she died childless at Haverholme Priory on 10 July 1848. His third marriage was on 17 October 1849, to Fanny Margaretta (<i>d</i>. 26 April 1909), eldest daughter of Edward Royd Rice of Dane Court, Kent. There were three sons, including the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33131/', "Harold Heneage Finch-Hatton")</script>, and a daughter from this marriage. Winchilsea died at Haverholme Priory, near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, on 8 January 1858.<br>
