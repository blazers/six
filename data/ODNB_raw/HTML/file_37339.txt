<span class="headword">Dancer,  John Benjamin</span>  (1812&#150;1887), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born on 12 October 1812 at 52 Great Sutton Street, London, the son of Josiah and Anna Maria Dancer. Josiah Dancer (1779&#150;1835) had worked for some time for the instrument maker Edward Troughton, but at this date had his own instrument business in partnership with his father, Michael. In 1816 both Josiah Dancer's wife and his father died, and by 1817 he had moved his business to Liverpool. It was here that John received some basic education at a dame-school and was then tutored in mathematics, French, Latin, and Greek. He later attended lectures at the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute. From an early age he assisted in his father's workshop, and also with the latter's lecture demonstrations. Josiah died in 1835, leaving the business to his son. On 22 March 1836 Dancer married Elizabeth Barrow (<i>d</i>. 1889), and the first of their eight children was born in the same year.<br>
<br>In Liverpool, Dancer made important contributions to the development of the Daniel electric cell, is thought to have prompted the initial development of electrotyping, and demonstrated the application of limelight to the magic lantern. In later years he developed a double lantern, which, combined with a gas tap of his own devising, enabled the projection of sophisticated &#145;dissolving views&#146;. In 1841 he moved to Manchester where he first worked in partnership as Abraham and Dancer. This arrangement lasted until 1845, by which date Dancer was well established in the local community: in 1842 he joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and later he was a founder member of the Manchester Photographic Society. Through these societies he maintained close contact with the city's scientists and industrialists, supplying many of them with instruments.<br>
<br>Dancer was one of the first provincial opticians to offer relatively inexpensive achromatic microscopes: an early example went to John Dalton, while another was used by James Prescott Joule in his determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat. Later Dancer devised a novel binocular microscope, an achievement which ensured continued demand for his instruments. His practical competence as a microscopist enabled him to provide support to the sanitary expert Robert Angus Smith. Dancer pioneered photography in Manchester, and developed what is now considered to have been the first effective stereoscopic camera. For Joseph Whitworth he made a bore-sight device for the accurate alignment of firearms. At its peak Dancer's workshop is reputed to have provided employment for twelve persons.<br>
<br>In 1852 Scott Archer developed the wet collodion process and this, combined with Dancer's great skill as a microscopist and photographer, enabled the latter to prepare the first &#145;microscopic photographs&#146; in 1852 or 1853. This involved the capture of a large object as a small photographic image. Significantly, an early Dancer microphotograph (as they were soon known) recorded the lettering on a memorial tablet, thus demonstrating the potential for data storage at reduced dimensions. Dancer mounted the microphotographs on slides for microscopical examination, and public interest in them as curiosities thereafter created an important market for his business. Their first significant application was during the siege of Paris, in 1870, when carrier pigeons were used to carry microphotographed messages.<br>
<br>In 1870 Dancer's sight began to fail, and he had to give up his business in 1878, though the production of microphotographs was carried on for some years by his daughters, Eleanor, Elizabeth, and Catherine. He died in near poverty in Manchester on 24 November 1887, and was buried in Brooklands cemetery in Sale.<br>
<br>Dancer was the most important provincial instrument maker of his time, yet throughout his life he was seldom able to exploit fully his numerous scientific and technological innovations. Indeed, his seminal contribution to the development of microphotography and the microfilm gained full recognition only during the twentieth century. His surviving instruments and microphotographs are now greatly prized.<br>
