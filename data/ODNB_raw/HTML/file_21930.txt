<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, third Lord Percy  (<em>c.</em>1321&#150;1368), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21929/', "Henry Percy, second Lord Percy (1301&#150;1352)")</script>, and his wife, Idonea (<i>d</i>. 1365), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5658/', "Robert, Lord Clifford")</script>. During his father's lifetime the younger Percy followed the sort of career in the king's wars expected of the son and heir of a leading baron. His father's constant involvement in the north meant that he could give his energies to campaigning in France. He served under the earl of Arundel in March 1344, and in August 1346 he was at Cr&eacute;cy. He then transferred to service under the earl of Lancaster both in June 1347 and in November 1349, in Gascony.<br>
<br>Entry into his inheritance in 1352 did not present a continuation of the sort of opportunities that had faced Percy's father. The character of relations between the English crown and Scotland had changed. By the time of the second Lord Percy's death Edward III was to all intents and purposes leaving Edward Balliol to his fate. Instead, he gave his attention to the exploitation of the captivity of David II, king of Scots, so as to secure a settlement that would detach the Scots from the French alliance. It was certainly a policy that made use of Percy, since it also required attention to the defence of the border.<br>
<br>In July 1352 Percy was joint warden of the marches, and in September 1355 he became keeper of Roxburgh Castle and sheriff of the county for two years. On 30 January 1356 he was one of the witnesses to Edward Balliol's surrender of the kingdom and crown of Scotland to Edward III; and he then took part in the invasion of Scotland that followed. In July 1356 he was once again joint warden of the marches and was then employed in the negotiations that led to the treaty of Berwick of October 1357. But the period of truce that ensued left no opportunity for martial exploits on the border. His role in the affairs of the region became essentially a diplomatic one, involving him in the protracted negotiations over the ransoming of David II and efforts to achieve a permanent settlement between England and Scotland.<br>
<br>The changed conditions on the border did permit Percy to participate in Edward III's military efforts in France. In September 1355 he was marshal of the royal army at Calais. In 1359&#150;60 he took part in the English king's grand campaign aimed at the capture of Rheims and his coronation as king of France. Percy was one of the English magnates at Calais on 24 October 1360 who swore to observe the terms of the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny. As in the case of Scotland, however, there were no further opportunities for a military career in France for the remainder of his life. As a leading magnate on 19 October 1364 he witnessed at Dover the treaty for the marriage of Edmund, earl of Cambridge, the king's youngest son, to Marguerite, duchess of Burgundy.<br>
<br>Percy's contemporary, the chronicler of Alnwick Abbey, summarized his place in his family's history with the judgement that, &#145;content with the lordship [dominio] left him by his father, he wished to obtain the lands or possessions of no one&#146;  (Dickson, 41). But these words contain an element of distortion since they ignore the nature of Anglo-Scottish relations in his time. What territorial gains might have come his way if he had been faced with the sort of opportunities available to his father and grandfather can only be the subject of speculation. Nor could he have been lacking in any kind of territorial ambition, since he chose as his second wife the sole heir to a baronial estate.<br>
<br>Percy had married first Mary (<i>d</i>. 1362), daughter of Henry, third earl of Lancaster, and second Joan (<i>d</i>. 1368), daughter and sole heir of John, Lord Orreby. With his first wife he had two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21932/', "Henry Percy")</script>, his heir, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21955/', "Thomas Percy")</script>. With his second wife he had a son who died in his father's lifetime and a daughter, Mary, aged two at her father's death. Percy died on about 18 May 1368, probably at his castle of Alnwick, and was buried in Alnwick Abbey.<br>
