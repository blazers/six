<span class="headword">Powell, Sir  (George) Allan</span>  (1876&#150;1948), <span class="occ">public servant</span>, was born on 1 February 1876 at Mile End, London, the son of Richard Powell, labourer, later school caretaker, and his wife, Mary Anne Clouter. He was educated at Bancroft's School and King's College, London, and was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1907. On 24 May 1904 Powell married Jeannie Jack (<i>b</i>. 1878/9), daughter of John Marshall, a Stepney physician and surgeon; they had one son.<br>
<br>Powell worked for the Metropolitan Asylums Board from 1894, reaching the post of assistant clerk to the board by 1914. Throughout the First World War he was resident officer-in-charge of the government war refugees camp at Earls Court, where he had charge of a shifting refugee community of 4000 allied soldiers and civilians. For this work he was made a CBE in 1920, and was also awarded the order of Leopold of Belgium, the white eagle of Serbia, and the m&eacute;daille de la Reconnaissance Fran&ccedil;aise. He published a book on his experiences, <span class="italic">Four Years in a Refugee Camp</span>, in 1924.<br>
<br>During the inter-war years Powell made his name as a distinguished public servant. He was clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board from 1922 until its transfer to the London county council (LCC) in 1930, and published its history, <span class="italic">The Metropolitan Asylums Board and its Work, 1867&#150;1930</span>, in 1930. Between 1930 and 1932 he organized a new department of public assistance for the LCC. Meanwhile, he was a member of the royal commission on food prices from 1924 to 1925, a member of the night baking committee in 1925, and in 1929, after four years as vice-chairman of the National Food Council and chairman of its executive committee (during which time he was knighted, in 1927), came to public prominence as its chairman (1929&#150;32).<br>
<br>From 1932 to 1939 Powell served full-time on the import duties advisory committee, acting as an unofficial liaison between the chairman of the committee, Lord May, the economic adviser Sir Sydney Chapman, and the consumer. He was appointed president of the state medicine and industrial hygiene section of the Public Health Congress in 1933, and chairman of the Institute of Public Administration conference in 1934, and sat on the committee on key industries duties in 1935. Elected to the council of the royal borough of Kensington in 1932, he was twice mayor, in 1937&#150;8 and 1938&#150;9.<br>
<br>In March 1939 Neville Chamberlain appointed Powell to the chairmanship of the board of governors of the BBC, where he succeeded R. C. Norman on 18 April 1939. Despite his successful administrative career Powell was not considered an obvious choice for the post: he memorably acknowledged on accepting the appointment that &#145;I know nothing of radio. Frankly, I don't know how many valves my set has got&#146;  (Briggs, <span class="italic">Governing the BBC</span>, 67). The question of his qualifications to arrange the variety programmes was raised in parliament, and the press did not fail to compare his new job with his previous responsibilities at the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The outbreak of war placed additional and unanticipated burdens on the post of chairman, notably from 1939 to 1941 when the number of governors was reduced from seven to two and the BBC's very independence came under government challenge.<br>
<br>Powell's role as the wartime BBC chairman remains ambiguous. He maintained a genial and uncontroversial public profile during the war, but his accommodating attitude to the government was a persistent source of concern within the corporation, notably his assurance to the minister of information Lord Macmillan in September 1939 that he accepted the direction of the government in all matters pertaining to the war effort, and his good relations with Churchill (one of the principal advocates of a &#145;controlled&#146; BBC). Although he worked actively behind the scenes to reappoint a far stronger and more influential full board of governors in April 1941, mistrust persisted as he oversaw the extension of closer ties between the BBC, Ministry of Information, and the intelligence services, assuming powers increasingly greater than those of the BBC director-general himself. In particular his &#145;feud&#146; with Director-General Frederick Ogilvie and his role in the latter's resignation in January 1942 (in order to facilitate reorganization of the corporation) fuelled internal concerns despite Ogilvie's recognized shortcomings in the post. Nevertheless, the BBC's fears of government control were not ultimately realized and, probably in part owing to Powell's willingness to compromise&#151;though also to the decision by the minister of information Brendan Bracken not to press home his advantage&#151;the BBC emerged from the war having played an essential part in maintaining public morale, and with its public reputation and status not simply secure but immeasurably enhanced.<br>
<br>Describing himself as simply an &#145;ordinary listener&#146;  (Briggs, <span class="italic">Governing the BBC</span>, 154), Powell impressed contemporaries with his energy and his courtly charm. A large, genial man, Powell was said to be a born chairman of committees, with the ability to bring out the best in others. He believed strongly in the future of broadcasting, and predicted as early as 1943 that television would be in every home after the war. He was reappointed to the chairmanship in 1944 and was made a GBE in the same year. He also maintained his wider interests in the field of public administration. As well as serving as chairman of the radio and cinema section of the British Association conference in 1943, he was a member of the committee on industrial alcohol in 1943, and in 1944 and 1946 again chaired the Institute of Public Administration conferences. Other positions held during his career included chairman of Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd, vice-president of the Royal Sanitary Institute (1939), and honorary fellow of the American Public Health Association.<br>
<br>Having overseen the opening day of post-war BBC television on 7 June 1946 (during which he&#151;like many other experienced public speakers new to the cameras&#151;momentarily &#145;dried&#146; on air), Powell retired from the BBC and in effect from public life on 31 December 1946. He died at his home, Mead Cottage, Ridgeway, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, on 24 January 1948. He was survived by his wife and their son Donald. Among many others at his memorial service, at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, were the director-general of the BBC, Sir William Haley, many officials and members of staff of the BBC, officials of the LCC, and the mayor and mayoress of Kensington.<br>
