<span class="headword">Wallace <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stein]</span>,  Grace Jane</span>, Lady Wallace  (1804&#150;1878), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 20 February 1804, the eldest daughter of John Stein of Carron Mills, Edinburgh (1769&#150;1814), distiller and MP, and Grace Bushby, daughter of John Bushby of Tinwald Downs, Dumfries. Her father was the sixth in descent from John Stein Craig, of Alloa. He was returned to parliament on 31 May 1796 for Bletchingley as a paying guest of Sir Robert Clayton, but he did not seek re-election in 1802. There is no information about Grace Jane's early education, which might have been carried out at home.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1824 Grace Jane Stein married Sir Alexander Don, sixth baronet (<i>c</i>.1779&#150;1826), of Newton Don, Berwickshire, widower of Lucretia Montgomerie (<i>d</i>. 1817), and MP for Roxburghshire (from 25 July 1814 to 11 March 1826). Don had been detained in Verdun after the resumption of war with France and was freed only after seventeen years. He was a good friend of Sir Walter Scott who remarked that &#145;he possessed strong natural parts, and in particular few men could speak better in public when he chose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 125). In fact Don was not a regular attender in parliament: on 5 March 1816 he gave a speech supporting his contributors' petition against the property tax and on 10 June 1819 he voted for the <span class="roman">Foreign Enlistment Bill</span>. Grace had two children with him: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7793/', "Sir William Henry Don (1825&#150;1862)")</script>, the celebrated actor, and Alexina Harriet Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1826&#150;1919), who married in 1844 Sir Frederick Acclom Milbank esquire. Sir Walter Scott wrote about Grace Jane in a letter to his son in 1825 &#145;Mamma and Anne are quite well. They are with me on a visit to Sir Alexr. Don and his new Lady, who is a very pleasant woman and plays on the harp delightfully&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 9.228). Sir Alexander died in 1826.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1836 Grace Jane Don married Sir James Maxwell Wallace (1783&#150;1867), fifth son of John Wallace of Kelly. Sir James entered the army in 1805, was promoted captain in 1807, served in the campaign of 1815, and took part in the battle of Waterloo. In September 1823 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel and in 1831 he received the honour of the knighthood. He was then promoted colonel (1838), major-general (1851), general (1863), and colonel of the 17th lancers (1864). Sir James and Lady Wallace had no children.<br>
<br>Grace Jane Wallace started her career as a translator in the latter years of her second marriage. She worked on German children's books and works of folkloric and historical interest. She translated some of Friedrich Wilhelm rittern von Hackl&auml;nder's widely popular works, publishing <span class="italic">Katherine and the Moment of Fortune</span> (1857), <span class="italic">The Old Monastery</span> (1857), and <span class="italic">Clara, or, Slave-Life in Europe</span> (1855), and also took an interest in the works of contemporary women writers, such as Marie Petersen (1816&#150;1859), Wilhelmine von Hillern (1836&#150;1916), Cecilia B&ouml;hl de Faber, known as Fern&aacute;n Caballero (1796&#150;1877), and Elise Polko (1823&#150;1899). She caught the attention of the publishers Longman with her preface to the translation of Schiller's <span class="italic">Life and Works</span> (1860) by Emil Palleske (1823&#150;1880), one of the few critical statements left by her, and one which reveals her reading of Carlyle's &#145;fine tribute to Schiller&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life of Schiller</span>, xi). For Longmans she translated the lives and letters of contemporary musicians, publishing the <span class="italic">Letters of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy from 1833 to 1847, edited by Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy and Dr Carl Mendelssohn Bartholdy</span> (1863); Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Letters from Italy and Switzerland</span> (1862); <span class="italic">Beethoven's Letters (1790&#150;1826) from the Collection of Dr Ludwig Nohl</span> (1866); and <span class="italic">The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1769&#150;1791)</span>, edited by Nohl (1865). These works were widely reviewed and remained the standard English translations until Emily Anderson's new editions for Macmillan. The <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, however, criticized Lady Wallace's translation of Mozart's letters for &#145;the perpetual repetition of the foolish expression &#147;our maestro&#148;&#146; and for &#145;the musical blunders&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 150, Oct 1879, 358) in translating German musical terminology. Her translation of Mendelssohn's letters was largely commended for its prose. Her last work was the translation of the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Empress Alexandra Feodorowna Empress of Russia</span> by August Theodor von Grimm (1870). Evidence to corroborate Charles Rogers's statement that Grace Jane Wallace was also a composer has not been found. Grace Jane Wallace died on 12 March 1878 at Isaberdour, Fife, Scotland.<br>
