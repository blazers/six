<span class="headword">Reed,  Austin Leonard</span>  (1873&#150;1954), <span class="occ">tailor and retailer</span>, was born on 6 September 1873, at 12 Howard Street, Reading, Berkshire, the eldest son of William Bilkey Reed, hosier and hatter in Reading, and his wife, Emma Florence Bowler.<br>
<br>After education at Reading School and some experience working in his father's shop, Reed joined the staff of a firm of hosiers in Ludgate Hill, London, as a clerk. In 1893 he went to the United States, where he worked in Wannamaker's General Store in Philadelphia, and with Hackett, Carhart &amp; Co., clothiers of New York, and Lincoln Bartlett, menswear importers in Chicago. He went back to Britain in 1896 with the ambition of founding a store inspired by those in America, which could provide the expanding ranks of new white-collar city workers with the latest in modern men's clothing. On 7 July 1900 Reed opened a new branch of the family shop under his own name in Fenchurch Street, London. This was followed by the opening of a second City store in 1905, by which time Reed's father had retired, selling the Reading business and leaving his son in control of a thriving London concern.<br>
<br>From the beginning Reed worked on clear principles. High-quality but unpretentious merchandise was to be presented through honest promotion with prices plainly marked and close attention paid to customer service. Much effort was devoted to originality in window display and shop fittings, and from the first advertising played an important part in the expansion of the business. Traditional press publicity was dropped by 1907 in favour of poster campaigns and a concentration on direct mailing, adapted to the particular requirements of individual clients. By 1908 there were three shops in the City and in 1911 the first West End branch was opened in Regent Street. In 1913 Reed made his first excursion into the provinces, in Birmingham. Manchester followed the next year and by 1930 most of the major cities in England were served, as well as Glasgow and Belfast. In 1929 a shop was opened aboard the liner <i>Aquitania</i>, and two were later opened on both the <i>Queen Mary</i> and the first <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>.<br>
<br>In 1910 the concern had become a private company and in 1920 Austin Reed Ltd offered their shares to the public on the stock exchange in an attempt to provide capital for continued growth. Although the post-war slump in the economy limited the take-up of shares, Reed put his faith in increased expansion, and, following careful customer research and a further trip to America, he implemented his plan to provide what he called &#145;a Savile Row suit for the middle-class man&#146; at a price he could afford. He deplored what he saw as the decline in British taste and, in competition with the democratizing trends of &#145;made to measure&#146; tailoring chains such as Burtons and Hepworths, offered a range of &#145;New Tailoring&#146; from 1925. It was distinctive through its good workmanship, wide variety of fittings, and heightened sense of fashionableness.<br>
<br>The new Regent Street shop, opened in 1926, provided a worthy setting for Reed's ideas. Nash's Regent Street was in process of demolition and Reed was lucky to obtain a place in the Quadrant at the lower end designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield. There the firm was able to provide every modern facility. Reed was a founder member of the Regent Street Association and its chairman in 1927. He was also a founder member of the National Association of Outfitters, president of the City of London Trade Association, a council member of the Multiple Shops Federation, and master of the Glovers' Company.<br>
<br>Through the 1920s and 1930s Reed ensured that the company retained its reputation for innovation, employing modernist designers including Tom Purvis and Fougasse, who lent a contemporary identity to promotional material. Employees also experimented with publishing <span class="italic">Modern Man</span>, a fashion magazine for men, and directed their energies towards niche marketing, supplying the clothing needs of Britain's colonial administrators in particular. On the outbreak of war in 1939, Reed deferred plans to retire. The provision of officers' military uniforms occupied the business until demobilization, and the return to civilian dress provided new challenges from 1945. Reed finally retired from the chairmanship in 1948.<br>
<br>Austin Reed was not only a highly skilled businessman, but won wide regard and friendship by his ideals of simplicity, sincerity, and a service devoted to good distribution with fair dealing and avoidance of exploitation. He combined these with a flair for forward-looking retail methods which reflected and encouraged the concurrent modernization of British menswear. He was an active Congregationalist and was deeply influenced by Frank Buchman, founder of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96078', "Moral Re-Armament movement")</script>, whom he met in 1933.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1902 Reed married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Alfred Wilson, a Reading butcher; they had two sons and four daughters. The younger son was killed as a fighter pilot in north Africa during the war. The elder son, Douglas, became vice-chairman of the firm in 1953. Austin Reed died at his home, Garden Reach, Camp Road, Bulstrode Park, Gerrards Cross, on 5 May 1954.<br>
