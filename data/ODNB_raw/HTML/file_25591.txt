<span class="headword">Simpson,  Robert</span>  (1792/1795&#150;1867), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church and writer</span>, was born in Edinburgh. Authorities differ on the year of his birth but give it as either 1792 or 1795. Details of his parentage remain obscure, and he apparently never spoke about it. At an early age he went to live with his grandparents in the parish of Stobo, Peeblesshire, where he attended the parish school. He went on to study at Edinburgh University with the intention of entering the ministry of the Church of Scotland, but while there his views changed, and he determined to become a Secession minister. To that end he entered the Divinity Hall at Selkirk under Dr George Lawson in 1814. He was ordained as the first minister of a newly established congregation at Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire, in May 1820. At the time of his call to Sanquhar he was also sought by a congregation in Duns, Berwickshire, and Simpson would have preferred the latter charge. However, the synod directed him to Sanquhar, and he remained there for the next forty-seven years.<br>
<br>Sanquhar had occupied a special position in what had been the heartland of the seventeenth-century covenanting movement. The region, and its turbulent history, became an all-absorbing interest for Simpson. Of his books, <span class="italic">Traditions of the Covenanters</span> (1843), <span class="italic">History of Sanquhar</span> (1853), and <span class="italic">Martyrland</span> (1861) all went to further editions, and the popularity of his work outlived him. During an active ministry he also wrote for religious periodicals and took a keen interest in temperance work. He enjoyed a reputation as a good preacher and a popular minister, and was known widely as simply &#145;the doctor&#146;.<br>
<br>Simpson married Jean (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of Robert Faulds, a banker and manufacturer in Beith. They had two daughters and four sons who predeceased them. Another daughter, Jane, outlived them. In 1853 Simpson was awarded the degree of DD by Princeton University. He died suddenly at Sanquhar on 8 July 1867 and was buried there; a granite obelisk to his memory was erected in front of the North United Presbyterian church at Sanquhar.<br>
