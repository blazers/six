</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Attwood,  Thomas</span>  (1783&#150;1856), <span class="occ">politician and currency theorist</span>, was born on 6 October 1783 at Hawne House, near Halesowen, Shropshire, the third son and fifth child of Matthias Attwood (1746&#150;1836), banker, and his wife, Ann Adams (1752&#150;1835), the daughter of Thomas Adams of Cakemore, near Halesowen, a yeoman farmer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52577/', "Charles Attwood")</script>, the ironmaster, was among his siblings.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundearlylifecurrencyreform"></a>Background; early life; currency reform</h2>The Attwood family was heavily involved in promoting the industrialization of the region around Birmingham. Thomas's grandfather George Attwood began mining the iron ore deposits of Halesowen in the middle of the eighteenth century, and opened the Corngreaves steel furnaces in 1771. By 1797 he had also opened a steel mill and a copper and rolling mill in Birmingham and he left a flourishing business to his sons Matthias and James on his death in 1817. Matthias, Thomas's father, bought the mineral rights to a 250 acre estate, close to Hawne, and a further estate of 175 acres in 1806. The Attwood family concerns flourished in the expansion of trade and industry in the west midlands in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Using capital built on the profits of the iron trade, Matthias opened a bank in Birmingham in 1791, in partnership with Issac Spooner, who drew his capital from a similar series of concerns. After attending the free school in Halesowen and later the Wolverhampton grammar school, Thomas entered the family bank in New Street, Birmingham, in 1799. His personal position, within an already wealthy family, was consolidated on 12 May 1806, when he married Elizabeth Carless (1784/5&#150;1840), who brought with her a marriage settlement of around &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>By 1811 Thomas Attwood, at only twenty-eight, had gained sufficient local recognition to be appointed high bailiff, the highest office of local government then available in the unincorporated town of Birmingham. In 1812 the town's major markets were threatened by the orders in council which placed an embargo on trade with America and parts of Europe. Attwood led a successful local movement to revoke the orders, and headed a deputation to London which gave evidence to a select committee of the House of Commons. To mark his central contribution to this movement, and its importance for the trade of the town, the artisans of Birmingham raised &pound;300 and presented him with an engraved silver plate.<br>
<br>Despite this early and positive contact with the working population of the town, there was little in his professed opinions in these years to suggest the radical positions Attwood would later adopt. His political background was that of a &#145;church and king&#146; tory and he displayed a corresponding mistrust of the growing popular movement for political reform. In 1810, during a period of food rioting in the town, he confided in a letter to his wife that &#145;there is no knowing what a parcel of hungry Burdettites may take into their heads&#146;  (Wakefield, 21). In 1822 he refused an invitation to join a celebratory dinner in the town to mark the release of the radical journalist T. J. Wooler from Warwick gaol because he felt that the popular radical commitment to universal suffrage &#145;would necessarily lead to the right of sitting in Parliament without the qualification of property&#146;. Nevertheless, by the 1820s Attwood, along with many members of the urban &eacute;lite at the time, came to recognize the need for a reform of parliament that would extend the franchise to men of the middle class. The lack of direct representation for large and growing towns such as Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds was widely seen to signal the exclusion of the industrial interest from the deliberations of Westminster. For Attwood this was particularly expressed by the unwillingness of Lord Liverpool's government to heed his advice in currency matters in a period which experienced periods of severe distress. In 1816 he wrote the first of a series of pamphlets on the subject of currency reform, <span class="italic">The Remedy, or, Thoughts on the Present Distress</span>. This dealt with the relationship between production, prosperity, and the ready availability of paper money. Over the next three years he published a total of seven pamphlets on the subject. Following the suspension of cash payments in 1797 the issue of the money supply had become a topic of great controversy. Attwood argued an underconsumptionist case: that the lack of available money limited the purchasing power of the population and that this, in turn, artificially limited levels of production. Unlike Malthus, he took the view that the system of production could always be expanded to meet the current need, but that this was possible only with a paper-based currency which could be augmented by a government issue at appropriate moments. He was condemned at the time as a &#145;currency crank&#146; by Francis Place, and his economic theories have led to his being seen as a &#145;crude inflationist&#146;. Nevertheless, this approach to economics enabled him to adopt a political position from which to argue convincingly for a cross-class alliance between employers and workers for political reform. Both groups, he argued, stood to gain from a high-profit/high-wage economy, but a government of landowners would not take the necessary steps.<h2>
<a name="TheBirminghamPoliticalUnion"></a>The Birmingham Political Union</h2>In 1827 Attwood was part of a committee of leading local men formed to support Tennyson's private member's bill to transfer the parliamentary representation from the rotten borough of East Retford to Birmingham. The failure of this gentlemanly initiative and the success of O'Connell's popular Catholic Association in pushing through Roman Catholic emancipation in 1828, convinced Attwood that widespread support for both currency reform and limited parliamentary reform might be tapped by an effectively organized popular campaign. On 25 January 1830, at a public meeting at Beardsworth's Repository attended by between 10,000 and 20,000 people, he launched the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42285', "Birmingham Political Union (BPU)")</script>. From the start the union's political programme was ill defined, beyond a general commitment to wider representation for the industrial interest. Nevertheless, Attwood was clear that its programme would not include universal suffrage or annual parliaments (though he was persuaded, in December 1830, to include the secret ballot as an objective). By August 1830 membership stood at only 6000&#151;far from his stated aim to mobilize &#145;two millions of people to think, speak and act as one man&#146;. But the fall of Wellington's government in November 1830, and the advent of the whig government of Earl Grey committed to introducing a reform bill, gave the BPU the political programme and the impetus that it had previously lacked. Attwood now became, in Place's words, &#145;the most influential man in England&#146;  (Brock, 62). Through his role as leader of the BPU he now led the extraparliamentary support for the parliamentary endeavours of the whigs. Aware that many of the union's working-class supporters wished to go beyond the limited objectives of the projected whig legislation, Attwood was careful to stress the common interests of employers and employees. At this time in his speeches he constantly referred to the &#145;industrious classes&#146;. This was a common enough term in the radical lexicon at the time, but Attwood used it to include &#145;productive capital&#146; in the same class as &#145;productive labour&#146;. As he put it, &#145;the interests of masters and men are, in fact one. If the masters flourish the men flourish with them; and if the masters suffer difficulties their difficulties must shortly affect the workmen in a threefold degree&#146;  (Briggs, 191). Nevertheless, he was careful to ensure that the leading political council of the union was made up exclusively of middle-class men. As he explained in later years, &#145;there is no instance in history in which political movements have been successful without leaders and in almost every instance those leaders have been men of wealth and influence&#146;  (Behagg, 75).<br>
<br>This strategy was remarkably effective both in Birmingham and in the many towns throughout the country which established political unions along Birmingham lines. Through 1831 and 1832 Attwood regularly addressed open-air reform meetings of between 50,000 and 200,000 people. At these he proved himself an effective platform orator, often making contact with his audiences by use of violent imagery. The use of the &#145;rhetoric of violence&#146;, or what Attwood himself referred to as &#145;wholesome violence&#146;, was a radical strategy established by a line of platform orators from Henry Hunt onwards, through which the people's right to resort to defensive violence was invoked. In November, following the rejection of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> by the Lords and riots in Bristol, Nottingham, and Derby, Attwood announced that the BPU was to arm itself as a sort of &#145;national guard&#146;. The scheme was abandoned when declared illegal by royal proclamation, but the scene was set for the &#145;Days of May&#146; in 1832, when a refashioned <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, passed by the Commons, was to come before the Lords. At a meeting at Newhall Hill, just outside Birmingham, in May 1832, Attwood announced to a cheering crowd of 200,000 that &#145;I would rather die than see the great bill of reform rejected or mutilated&#146;  (Wakefield, 201). Two days later Grey resigned when the king refused to create the whig peers needed to push the bill through the Lords. With the expectation that Wellington would become prime minister, and rumours that a warrant was already issued for Attwood's arrest, all work ceased in Birmingham and 100,000 people gathered spontaneously at Newhall Hill to hear Attwood declare Wellington's &#145;incompetency to govern&#146; and invoke the &#145;right to arm&#146; from the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span>  (Wakefield, 207, 209). Over the next, tense, days Attwood's house was guarded by armed men. In the event Wellington stood down and the bill was pushed through to become law in June 1832.<br>
<br>&#145;King Tom&#146;, as Attwood was dubbed by Cobbett, was the obvious choice as one of the new borough's first members of parliament, alongside the merchant Joshua Scholefield, another BPU activist; they were returned unopposed, and Attwood topped the poll at the subsequent contested elections of 1835 and 1837. Yet entry to parliament was profoundly disillusioning for Attwood. The focus of power had not moved to &#145;productive capital&#146;, and he soon found that addressing a hostile House of Commons, without party affiliations, was a very different experience from BPU oratory. Nor was there a sympathetic reception for his currency theories; the prolixity of his speeches will have alienated many. His disappointment was shared by his working-class supporters and the BPU broke up acrimoniously in June 1834.<br>
<br>Attwood was, however, behind a move to revive the union in 1837, this time to petition for the award of a charter of incorporation for the town under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> of 1835. Attwood saw a future town council as a permanent and official version of the old BPU. There was a good deal of local tory opposition to the move, and Attwood saw that an 1832-style alliance between the working class and that section of middle-class opinion which supported him would be powerful enough to carry the measure. A revamped BPU was launched in May 1837, ostensibly to consider the declining state of trade. At this point, while conceding that further reform of parliament might be necessary, Attwood would not be committed beyond a call for household suffrage. Without an acceptance of universal suffrage, however, working people would not now join the BPU. In October 1837 Attwood spoke to a town's meeting on incorporation which attracted a mere 2500 people. In January 1838 he declared his conversion to universal suffrage, adding, &#145;and if ever I uttered a word against it I now altogether retract it&#146;  (Behagg, 74). Working people now joined the union in their thousands, and on the back of this support a successful petition for incorporation was submitted to the privy council, which ensured that Birmingham was declared an incorporated borough. The town's first council was elected in November 1838, when BPU candidates swept the board.<h2>
<a name="AttwoodandChartism"></a>Attwood and Chartism</h2>As a convert to universal manhood suffrage, at the head of the revived BPU, Attwood now found himself welcomed wholeheartedly into the arms of the developing Chartist movement. The public respect paid to him by radicals such as Feargus O'Connor was real enough since he was seen in popular memory as the man who had successfully confronted the duke of Wellington in May 1832. On 21 May 1838 he joined representatives of the anti-poor law movement from Lancashire and Yorkshire, and of the London Working Men's Association, to speak at a mass rally in Glasgow. Here the idea of a national petition was floated. The petition would endorse the six points of the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span> drawn up the year before: universal manhood suffrage, annual parliaments, vote by ballot, the creation of equal electoral districts, the payment of wages for members of parliament, and the abolition of the property qualification. This petition would be drawn up by delegates from the regions, who would meet in London as a national Chartist convention. Attwood would then present the petition to the House of Commons. By this stage he had accepted the one point of the <span class="roman">Charter</span> about which he had continued to express doubts: that equal electoral districts would distort representation in favour of Ireland.<br>
<br>The Chartist movement grew in the summer of 1838. Attwood and O'Connor spoke on the same platform to a meeting of 150,000 people at Newhall Hill in August that year. Here they launched the local campaign to collect signatures for the petition and elect delegates to the Chartist convention. At this meeting both O'Connor and Attwood spoke of the importance of peaceful petitioning to achieve the <span class="roman">Charter</span>, but both also invoked the people's right to self-defence. As Attwood put it, &#145;No blood shall be shed by us; but if our enemies shed blood&#151;if they attack the people&#151;they must take the consequences on their own heads&#146;  (Behagg, 76). For Attwood this was a return to the platform oratory, and the strategy of &#145;wholesome violence&#146;, that had been so effective in the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> campaign. This time, however, there were problems. Local working-class Chartists objected to the exclusively middle-class membership of the BPU's governing political council and pushed through the election of working men. Having attended some of the Chartist convention's meetings in London, early in 1839, the middle-class delegates from Birmingham resigned <i>en bloc</i>, arguing that physical force was being advocated. When Attwood came to present the national petition to the House of Commons, on 14 June 1839, he found himself in a difficult position. Chartism was a very different political movement from the earlier agitation for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. The middle-class voice was not heard with the same authority and the unity of interests between employers and employees, so long the basis of Attwood's political creed, was not always accepted by working-class Chartists, many of them trade unionists. He had always been a reluctant convert to universal suffrage, arguing pragmatically that it was the only strategy that would ensure mass support. Besides this, the convention debated his currency theories and rejected them, a point that was raised, to his embarrassment, in the House of Commons during the debate on the national petition. His speech on this occasion fell short of unqualified support for Chartism. He endorsed the six points, but made it clear that he washed his hands &#145;of any talk of physical force or arms&#146;  (Wakefield, 348).<br>
<br>The rejection of the petition by the House of Commons was followed by two weeks of rioting in Birmingham in July 1839. The responsibility for public order locally now fell to a number of the middle-class BPU members, who had been elected to the town council in November 1838, and who had resigned from the Chartist convention by April 1839. With its working-class rank and file disaffected, and its middle-class leadership diverted into municipal politics, the BPU now faded away. Attwood's disillusionment with parliamentary politics was now compounded by his disappointment with popular politics. In December 1839, with his health failing, he announced his retirement from Westminster. He spent the next year in Jersey attempting to recover, but on 26 April 1840 suffered the loss of his wife after a prolonged illness. The following year he discovered that the family bank, under the management of his brother George, had run up debts to the value of &pound;12,000. With the business dissolved to pay the debt Attwood now withdrew to Harborne, Warwickshire, his home since 1823. In August 1843 he was briefly enticed from his lonely retirement in a last attempt to unite the &#145;industrious classes&#146;. His National Union or General Confederation of All Classes aimed to draw attention to the underlying causes of the current economic distress. The initiative had failed by November 1843, its non-political stance alienating the local Chartist groups for whom acceptance of the <span class="roman">Charter</span> had become the touchstone for their support of any organization.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1844, at the age of sixty, Attwood married Elizabeth Grice, who had been a family friend for some years. By this stage he was still suffering financial difficulties and the first stages of what was probably Parkinson's disease. In 1848 the couple moved to the village of Allesley, but Attwood's condition was deteriorating. In 1855 he moved to Ellerslie, Great Malvern, to attend a clinic run by a Dr Johnson, where he remained until his death on 6 March 1856. He was buried in Hanley churchyard in Upton upon Severn. His second wife survived him.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>By the time of his death Attwood's fame of the 1830s had receded. It proved difficult to collect the &pound;800 necessary to raise a memorial to him in Birmingham, but on 7 June 1858 a statue was unveiled in Stephenson Place with an inscription which recalled his role as the BPU's founder. He was largely ignored by historians for another century, but then a growing interest in radical movements and their manifestations in the localities drew attention to his achievements in this field. Research by Asa Briggs and a biographical study by G. D. H. Cole led the way to an authoritative biography by David Moss in 1990. Historians have acknowledged Attwood's role as a leader of the new industrial middle class in the growing industrial towns, seeking its place in a society still dominated by landed wealth and political influence. His leadership of the extraparliamentary reform movement in 1830&#150;32 is widely recognized, though its impact on the passage of the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> remains debatable. The notion that his currency ideas were eccentric has been challenged in the wake of Keynesian economics. Nevertheless, Attwood's enduring significance lies in his role as a middle-class man who became a platform agitator at a time of significant economic and social change.<br>
