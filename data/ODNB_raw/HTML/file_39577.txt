<span class="headword">Harris, Sir  Charles Joseph William</span>  (1901&#150;1986), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 10 June 1901 at his parents' home, 249 Upper Street, Islington, London. His father, William Harris, was a stud groom and came from Thornaugh, near Wansford in Northamptonshire; his mother, Edith Elizabeth Goldsmith, was a lady's maid and came from Ramsgate in Kent. Because his parents were in domestic service in London he was brought up by his grandmother and his aunt Anne Goldsmith in Ramsgate. He was educated at Christ Church School there, but he left at fourteen and worked in a greengrocer's shop. As a boy scout at the beginning of the war he helped out at the naval base in Ramsgate and there attracted the attention of Lieutenant-Commander Dudley Ward MP, a former and a subsequent Liberal whip. In October 1917 Ward arranged for Harris to be considered for a clerical job in the whips' office at 12 Downing Street. He was accepted and stayed there for forty-four years, starting as office boy to Freddie Guest, the National Liberal chief whip (during the coalition there were joint chief whips). He soon became involved in the setting up of the Coalition Liberal organization for the 1918 election and the allocation of &#145;coupons&#146; to trustworthy Lloyd George candidates.<br>
<br>In 1919 Harris started to work for Lord Edmund Talbot (later Viscount Fitzalan), the Conservative chief whip, at &pound;100 per annum; he became active in the organization of parliamentary business, with a desk in the whips' office in the Commons. When Leslie Wilson became chief whip in the 1922 Bonar Law government, he formally appointed Harris as his private secretary at &pound;400 per annum. Harris married, on 7 June 1924, Emily Kyle Thompson (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), to whom he was introduced by her uncle George Thompson, who was Freddie Guest's agent. She was the daughter of John Drysdale Thompson, a cabinet-maker. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1924 and again in 1929, when the Conservatives went into opposition, Harris continued to work as private secretary to their chief whip. It was only in 1939 that, with the agreement of the leader of the opposition, he became a fully established civil servant, as &#145;assistant to the parliamentary secretary to the treasury&#146; with a salary of &pound;850 per annum. Clement Attlee wrote &#145;Mr Harris would be an admirable man for the post&#146;  (Attlee to Sir James Rae, 14 Feb 1939, priv. coll.). In 1945, when Labour came to power, the new chief whip, William Whiteley, took it for granted that Charles Harris would continue in the job. He found the transition from Conservative employee to civil servant entirely easy, although he felt that some looked askance at the move. When Harris retired in July 1961, Hugh Gaitskell observed that the post-war Labour government &#145;had no more faithful servant than Sir Charles Harris&#146;  (Butler).<br>
<br>When Harris started in the whips' office there were no records. Harris later wrote, &#145;I can modestly claim to have endeavoured to secure method, planning and arrangement to the business of the House &hellip; The new &#147;age&#148; was taking hold. The easy-going gentlemanly methods were giving place to more exact planning&#146;  (priv. coll.). He was responsible for helping the chief whip in his task of organizing the legislative programme for the session, assessing what could reasonably be achieved. He knew that all governments were &#145;too ambitious&#146;, and that they put into the queen's speech their &#145;impossible hopes&#151;legislation which they will have no hope of passing or intention of implementing&#146;.<br>
<br>R. H. S. Crossman wrote that &#145;Sir Charles Harris was for years and years an absolutely key figure &hellip; a little round ball-bearing linking Government and Opposition Offices &hellip; [running] the Speaker and also, to some extent, the Opposition&#146;. He was &#145;hugely influential&#146;; his exact memory led him to be described as &#145;a flesh-and-blood storehouse of Parliament's own case-law&#146;  (Crossman, 2.23). Crossman commented:<blockquote>The Chief Whip and the Leader don't spend much time on the Parliamentary time-table. This is completely in the hands of the Chief Whip's Secretary. Partly this is inevitable and healthy because the goodwill of the Opposition is required and this is most easily attained when they spend their time talking to a non-partisan, non-political civil servant. (ibid., 366&#150;7)</blockquote>Few papers are preserved by the whips' office and fewer are ever released. There are hardly any events in which the role played by Sir Charles Harris is explicitly recorded; anecdotes are hard to come by but there is no doubt that his competence and discretion established the post of secretary to the chief whip as an essential, if unknown, part of the government of the country. The orderly arrangement of parliamentary business is conducted through &#145;the usual channels&#146;. It was Sir Charles Harris's genius to see that affairs almost always flowed smoothly through those channels. When inter-party communications broke down during the general strike and at the time of Suez, he continued to provide a discreet link. He and his successors have developed a role that has become central to Westminster politics. Peter Hennessy notes:<blockquote>Occasionally Harris surfaces in the more sensitive documents at the Public Record Office. For example, in the file dealing with the royal prerogative and the dissolution of Parliament during the run-up to the October 1959 General Election, Freddie Bishop, the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary, minuted Harold Macmillan that &#145;I have consulted Sir Charles Harris about the precedents&#146;. Harris was quite simply <i>the</i> collective memory by that stage of his career and the first person called upon when, as it were, the written precedents ran out or were contradictory. (Hennessy, letter in priv. coll.)</blockquote>Charles Harris was appointed CBE in 1927 (at the age of twenty-six). One letter of congratulation (from a civil servant, Douglas Veale) ran &#145;The way you carry out your intricate and harassing work without any friction whatever has always been a marvel&#146;  (3 June 1927, priv. coll.). Another from a junior clerk ran, &#145;You are undoubtedly the most popular person in the House with MPs, Press and staff, all grades&#146;  (priv. coll.). He certainly managed his complex task with immense amiability. He was a handsome man, 6 foot tall and dark-haired, modest but with a sure confidence in his own ability, his prodigious memory, and his feel for politics and politicians. He was the most discreet and sure-footed of political operators. Harris was knighted in 1952 and raised to KBE in 1961. He died at Bushey and District Hospital, Hertfordshire, on 14 January 1986. A granddaughter (Julia Drown) became a Labour MP in 1997.<br>
