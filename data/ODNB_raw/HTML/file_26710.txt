<span class="headword">Stuart,  James</span>  (1741&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 2 March 1741 at Blairhall, Perthshire, the third son of John Stuart of Blairhall and his wife, Lady Anne (1703&#150;1783), daughter of Francis Stuart, seventh earl of Moray. He was educated at the schools at Culross and Dunfermline, and in 1757 went to Edinburgh to study law. Abandoning the law, he entered the army on 1 October 1761 as ensign in the 64th foot, became lieutenant on 7 December 1764, and captain on 12 January 1770. He served in the American War of Independence, and attained the rank of major in the 78th foot on 18 December 1777.<br>
<br>In 1782 Stuart arrived with his regiment in India, where he was appointed lieutenant-colonel on 14 February, and to the local rank of colonel on 13 June following. He took part in Sir Eyre Coote's campaign against Haidar Ali of Mysore, and was present at the siege of Cuddalore, when he commanded the attack on the right of the main position in the assault of 13 July 1782. In the campaign of 1790, under General Sir William Medows, against Tipu Sultan of Mysore, he reduced the fortresses of Dindigul and Palghat. He served under Cornwallis through the campaigns of 1791&#150;2, was placed in immediate charge of the siege of Seringapatam, and commanded the centre column in the assault of 6 February 1792. On 8 August he was promoted colonel on his appointment as aide-de-camp to the king, and, after a visit to England, returned to Madras in 1794. On 26 February 1795 he was appointed major-general, and in the same year took command of the expedition which captured the Dutch possessions in Ceylon. These were secured in 1796. Stuart then became commander-in-chief of the forces in Madras. On 2 March 1797 he was appointed colonel of the 82nd regiment of foot, and on 23 October 1798 colonel of the 72nd regiment of foot. In the following year, in the last war against Tipu, he commanded the Bombay army which occupied Coorg and repulsed Tipu at Seedaseer (6 March). On 15 March he joined Major-General George Harris before Seringapatam, and took charge of the operations on the northern side of the city. After its capture Stuart, with several other officers, received the thanks of both houses of parliament. In 1801 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Madras army; on 29 April 1802 he attained the rank of lieutenant-general, and in the following year took part in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, Major-General Wellesley being under his orders. In 1805 he returned to England in bad health; he was promoted general on 1 January 1812. Stuart died in London at Charles Street, Berkeley Square, on 29 April 1815, and was buried in a vault in St James's Chapel, Hampstead Road, London.<br>
