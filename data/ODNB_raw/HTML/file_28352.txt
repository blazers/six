<span class="headword">Wilson <span class="st"> [Volusene]</span>,  Florence</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1551), <span class="occ">humanist scholar</span>, like other sixteenth-century Scots named Wilson, employed the form Volusene (Latinized as Volusenus) abroad. He was born early in the sixteenth century somewhere near Elgin on the banks of the Lossie, and was educated there with his schoolfellow John Ogilvie, later rector of Cruden and canon of Aberdeen, with whom he discussed Horace by the riverside. From Elgin he went to King's College, Aberdeen, where he took his MA and was friendly with the principal, Hector Boece, whose admiration for Erasmus he shared. This would be about 1519. He may have earlier crossed England on his way to France, but is first recorded in England in September 1526. A letter from Sir George Lawson to Thomas Cromwell asks Antonio Bonvisi (a rich merchant from Lucca who was a member of Sir Thomas More's circle) to write to &#145;Mr Florens&#146; to ensure that Lawson's son is kept continually at school. In October a correspondent of Cromwell's writing from Paris mentions that Thomas Winter, Cardinal Wolsey's natural son, is being tutored by a Scot, described as &#145;a kind and very gentle person and well learned&#146; in a house belonging to the lord of St John's  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/2, no. 2545); this is presumed to be Wilson. Visiting England in October 1528, Wilson wrote from Richmond to Cromwell, sending regards to Bonvisi and Vincenzo Casale. By mid-March 1529 he was still in England, and Winter missed him; but in April he wrote to Cromwell thanking him for his horse, which he had sold in Paris.<br>
<br>Wilson provided Cromwell with continental news, and in late April 1531 with word of French heretics, based on information from Guillaume du Bellay. He now had the living of Speldhurst in John Fisher's diocese of Rochester, and promised to visit London in May. In February 1532 he was reported to be visiting Italy, but in April one of Cromwell's correspondents had to subsidize him for books bought in Paris. He was again engaged in buying books for Cromwell a year later. At the end of May 1535, when his English patron John Fisher was about to be tried for treason, Wilson was reported to have brought news to Bonvisi that Fisher was being created a cardinal. None the less, on 19 September Wilson felt able to recommend John Borthwick to Cromwell for speaking favourably of Henry VIII's divorce in the presence of French notables.<br>
<br>Wilson was then at Chaumont on his way to Italy, hoping for a university post. But on his journey he took ill at Avignon, and decided to present himself to Jacopo Sadoleto, the cardinal-bishop of Carpentras, and was offered a post as schoolmaster in that city. An English friend, Thomas Starkey, had commended the cardinal to him, and Wilson informed Starkey of his appointment in a letter written from Bonvisi's house in Lyons. In June 1536 he wrote again to Cromwell, saying that he had composed a defence of Henry VIII, and asking in return for Cromwell's help in retaining his Speldhurst benefice. Sadoleto, meanwhile, was paying 70 crowns a year to Wilson, who hoped for a quiet spell teaching Latin and Greek. With conditions uncertain in England, where not only More and Fisher but also Cromwell himself fell foul of Henry VIII, Wilson remained in Lyons, teaching, it seems, in its college where Sebastien Castellion was, who later taught in Geneva. The college principal, Barth&eacute;lemy Aneau, in the preface he supplied to Alciati's emblem book (editions of 1549, 1558, and 1564) praised Wilson's proficiency in languages, namely Greek, Latin, Scots, French, Italian, and Spanish, as well as his natural goodness. Conrad Gesner, who met Wilson in Lyons in 1540, considered him still a young man.<br>
<br>In 1546 Wilson exchanged correspondence with Sadoleto, with the latter advising continued loyalty to the Catholic church, while Wilson pointed out that it was hard for him to approve the burning of learned men; yet he wished to remain moderate, and cited his friendly <i>causeries</i> with the archdeacon of Cavaillon. Through his contacts with Bonvisi, he became acquainted with others from Lucca, a town associated with Pietro Martire Vermigli and Bernardino Ochino, both refugees from Catholicism. Loyalty won, however, and he remained faithful to Sadoleto's religion. In 1551 he was appointed public orator by the municipality for Lyons's feast of St Thomas, and he just may have been the Lyons Scot who objected in writing to the burning of Servetus by Calvin in 1553, and supported Castellion who had fled from Geneva to Basel. Wilson died at Vienne in the Dauphin&eacute;, south of Lyons, at a date which is unrecorded but presumably during the 1550s.<br>
<br>Wilson's earliest publications were two slim commentaries on individual psalms, <span class="italic">Psalmi quintidecimi enarratio</span> (1531), dedicated to the cardinal of Lorraine, and <span class="italic">In psalmo nobis 50, Hebraeis vero 51, enarratio</span> (1532), dedicated to Bishop Stephen Gardiner; they show him to have been well read in Greek, and citing two rabbis, Abraham ibn Ezra and David Kimhi, and also praising More, not only for his literary talent but also for his integrity. He owed a greater debt to Fisher, however, and the Hebrew dictionary (1523 edition) he presented to George Buchanan before leaving Paris was dedicated to Fisher by Sebastian Munster. Wilson's <span class="italic">Scholia, seu, Commentariorum epitome in Scipionis somnium</span> (1535?) is dedicated to Thomas Cromwell's son Gregory. He visited Scotland about this time, and borrowed a horse from his old friend John Ogilvie, to whom he sent Erasmus's <span class="italic">Apophthegmata</span> (1533) as a gift, with a note referring in friendly terms to Hector Boece. In 1538 Gilbert Ducher published his <span class="italic">Epigrammatum libri II</span> at Basel, with an epigram addressed to Wilson, and a long poem of Wilson's appears in Orgetorix Sphinter's <span class="italic">Pii, graves atque elegantes poetae aliquot</span> (<i>c</i>.1550), confirming his Lyons associations. His poems appear at the end of the edition by Thomas Wilson (Volusenus) of Patrick Adamson's <span class="italic">Poemata sacra</span> (1619); they include one for Antonio Bonvisi and another to a young man falling in love.<br>
<br>Wilson's <span class="italic">Commentatio quaedam theologica</span> (1539), dedicated to a citizen of Lucca, emphasizes points of belief common to Catholics and reformed, and is written in a style later to be typical of Castellion's bible translation, replete with Christianized Ciceronian expressions. It has been cited as an example of &#145;rhetorical theology&#146;. His <span class="italic">De animi tranquillitate dialogus</span> (1543) is dedicated to Francesco Micheli, later tried for heresy at Lucca and a fugitive to Geneva. It is an eclectic and attractively written work, showing influences from both ends of the theological spectrum, with friends like John Borthwick and Crichton of Brunstane quoted from the reformed side, and Fisher from the other. All in all, despite echoes of the young Calvin, it is an orthodox work, and was translated into Italian in 1574. His phrase &#145;beneficium Christi&#146; echoes the <span class="italic">Beneficio di Ges&ugrave; Cristo</span> of Marcantonio Flaminio. A <span class="italic">Latinae grammatices epitome</span> (1544) cites Melancthon and Despauterius as authorities. Calvin's burning of Servetus and criticism of the classicizing Castellion would not appeal to a man of moderation, and Calvin attacked the anonymous Scot whom he saw as Castellion's disciple, for attempting to publish a critique of himself in Paris, a work now lost. This was probably Wilson, for no other Scot in Basel or Lyons fits the bill. Buchanan wrote an epigram in Wilson's praise.<br>
