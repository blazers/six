<span class="headword">Knight,  John Baverstock</span>  (1785&#150;1859), <span class="occ">land surveyor and painter</span>, was born on 3 May 1785 at the rectory, Langton Long Blandford, Dorset, the third of eight children of James Forster Knight (1751&#150;1808), captain, 3rd Dorset militia, and his wife, Sophia (1751/2&#150;1820), daughter of Colonel John Kay. His parents lived at the Down House, Blandford St Mary, which Knight had inherited with Littleton and Langton manors. John was baptized at Langton rectory, home of his aunt (wife of the rector, Dr J. H. Ridout), on 28 May 1786. Knight was educated privately at home, then at Mr Longman's Commercial School at Child Okeford. He started his career as land surveyor and agent as assistant to his father, a reputed connoisseur of art who encouraged his son's talents in drawing, and lived at his parents' home, the Manor House, Anderson, Dorset. He married Elinor Bulkeley Evans (<i>fl</i>. 1809&#150;1824), daughter of the Revd Humphrey Evans of Glanville Wootton, on 20 December 1809; they moved to West Lodge, Piddlehinton, Dorset, in 1812 and had eight children.<br>
<br>Knight followed a strict daily regime, rising at 5 a.m., painting from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., then embarking on business. He invented a surveying instrument to measure the exact extent of land from a relatively remote location; his expertise as a surveyor and in architectural design led to his arbitrating in property disputes. Knight was employed by many landowners including the duke of Bedford, and Eton and Winchester colleges. Most of his work was in Dorset, but in 1811 he surveyed in Devon for Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1812 he reported on estates in Antrim, Londonderry, and Tipperary. He was an inclosure commissioner in Hampshire and Dorset, and was engaged on tithe work in Dorset (<i>c</i>.1839&#150;45) with his son Humphrey Evans Knight and other surveyors, including George Easton, John Martin, and, probably, Levi Luckham.<br>
<br>Knight built a studio at Piddlehinton, decorating it with a mythological painting. He painted portraits in oils of many county families including Josiah Wedgwood of Eastbury Park, Lord Arundell of Wardour, the sixth duke of Bedford and, in 1820 and 1821, James John Farquharson of Langton and his family. His portraits were commended by Sir Thomas Lawrence; his copies of old masters were good enough to deceive experts. He was an honorary exhibitor at the Royal Academy in 1818 and 1819; Benjamin West and Henry Fuseli praised his skill. Knight was versatile and also produced watercolours, etchings, and miniatures. An album containing watercolours and pen and wash drawings of places on the duke of Bedford's estates, together with other works by Knight, is now in Dorset County Museum. His drawings, many of which are of Lake District scenes (such as <span class="italic">Lodore, Derwentwater</span>; V&amp;A), show the influence of J. R. Cozens, J. S. Cotman, and Thomas Girtin. Many are in monochrome or blue-grey; others use light colour, for example <span class="italic">Axbridge Vale</span> (Tate collection). Hardie regards them as his best work, with skilful handling of receding planes and a strong feeling for composition. His etchings were mostly topographical and were published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> from 1816 and in the second edition of J. Hutchins's <span class="italic">History of Dorset</span> (1815). Knight was prolific: he painted throughout the British Isles and on the continent. Particularly large collections of his work are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath, the Dorchester Museum, and Dorset County Record Office, with others in many regional museums.<br>
<br>Knight was &#145;a magnificent specimen of the country squire&#146;  (MacColl, 171), tall, handsome, and stately. He owned land at Brockenhurst in Hampshire as well as in Piddlehinton. His interests in the countryside were wide-ranging and included horticulture; he was an excellent sportsman. He was well-loved, a churchwarden, and notable for his charities. He was a wit and wrote poetry.<br>
<br>In 1856 he resigned his membership of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and his health began to fail. He died at his daughter's house at Broadway, Dorset, on 14 May 1859 and was buried there on 19 May.<br>
