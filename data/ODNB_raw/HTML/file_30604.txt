<span class="headword">Barnes,  John Gorell</span>, first Baron Gorell  (1848&#150;1913), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Anfield Cottage, Walton on the Hill, near Liverpool, on 16 May 1848, of a Derbyshire family. He was the eldest child of Henry Barnes, a shipowner in Liverpool, and Georgiana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, the daughter of the rector of Staveley, Derbyshire, who had also been a fellow and dean of Trinity College, Cambridge. His great-grandfather Edward Gorell was a member of the religious sect founded by John Glas, but his father and uncles eventually left the sect to become Anglicans. Barnes was educated at various private schools around Liverpool before being sent, after his father's sudden death on 15 February 1865, to Peterhouse, Cambridge, the college of the mathematician Edward John Routh who was related to the Barnes family by marriage. He was classed as a senior optime in his BA examination in January 1868. Cambridge had a big influence on his life and he was made an honorary LLD in 1898 and an honorary fellow of Peterhouse in 1899.<br>
<br>After a short period in his father's old shipowning firm, Barnes joined a firm of solicitors in Liverpool. He was never admitted and a few years later took his firm's advice to go to the bar. He joined the Inner Temple in 1873, and after reading in equity chambers became a pupil in October 1874 of James Charles Mathew, then the leading commercial junior in the Temple and later Court of Appeal judge. He worked there until Mathew was promoted to judge in 1881. Called to the bar in 1876, Barnes succeeded to Mathew's great junior practice. He gradually added a substantial Admiralty practice and much mercantile work on the northern circuit. He appeared regularly in the Court of Appeal, the House of Lords, and the privy council. In 1881 he married Mary Humpston (<i>d</i>. 1918), eldest daughter of Thomas Mitchell of West Arthurlee, Renfrewshire; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After seven years of hard work, Barnes became queen's counsel in 1888 in an attempt to reduce his workload. He made an immediate mark as a weighty, industrious, and popular leader and in June 1892 was unexpectedly made a judge of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division in succession to Sir Francis Henry Jeune, afterwards Lord St Helier, who had just succeeded Sir Charles Parker Butt as president. In February 1905 Barnes succeeded Jeune, remaining president until February 1909, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Gorell of Brampton, near Chesterfield. As president, he sat in the Court of Appeal and on the judicial committee of the privy council, and from July 1909 to July 1912 he sat regularly in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Gorell found time and energy for much extra-judicial work. He was a member of a committee appointed by the lord chancellor to consider improvements in the High Court. He was chairman of the county courts committee which reported in 1909 and laid the basis for some of the proposals of the royal commission on divorce. In 1909 he also acted as an arbitrator in a dispute between the Great Eastern Railway Company and its employees. In the same year he was chairman of the copyright committee, whose report led to the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1911.<br>
<br>Following a strong speech which Gorell made in the House of Lords in which he said that the law which he had administered as a judge for sixteen years needed radical amendment, a royal commission on divorce and matrimonial causes was established in 1909 and Gorell was appointed chairman. The majority report (signed on 30 January 1912) recommended an extension of the grounds for divorce to include desertion, cruelty, incurable insanity, habitual drunkenness, and penal servitude for life in commutation of a death sentence. The minority report, meanwhile, rejected any extension of the grounds for divorce. There was, however, agreement on a large number of reforms in law and procedure, including far-reaching proposals relating to nullity of marriage, presumption of death for purposes of remarriage, equality of the sexes for divorce purposes, and restraints on the publication of reports of divorce cases.<br>
<br>The commission came to an end in November 1913. By then Lord Gorell's health was rapidly breaking down. He died at Menton in France on 22 April 1913 and was buried on the 28th in Brampton churchyard, near Chesterfield, beside his grandfather John Gorell Barnes.<br>
<br>Gorell had a brief, rapid, and smoothly successful career at the bar. The judgments he made as a judge of first instance were rarely reversed. To him can be credited, in part at least, the foundation of the commercial court, since it was an idea he developed jointly with Sir James Charles Mathew. Soon after his appointment to the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division, he announced that he was prepared to take cases raising points of insurance law, and so attracted commercial solicitors. The establishment of the commercial court from 1 March 1895 under Mathew was a successful development of Gorell's experiment  (see <span class="italic">Weekly Notes</span>, 2 March 1895).<br>
<br>Gorell combined enthusiasm for his work with an unusual capacity for mastering complicated facts. He was particularly adept at exposing the principle underlying any particular set of circumstances. Many of his judgments made distinct contributions to the growth of English law, while his work on the divorce commission revealed his liberal and reformist tendencies. Throughout his life he retained some of the theological severity which had been so pronounced in his parents and grandparents.<br>
<br>Gorell was succeeded by his elder son, Henry Gorell Barnes, second Baron Gorell, a barrister of promise, who was killed in action at Ypres in January 1917, and was succeeded as third baron by his younger brother, Ronald Gorell Barnes.<br>
