</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robeck, Sir  John Michael  de</span>, baronet  (1862&#150;1928), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 10 June 1862 at Gowran Grange, Naas, co. Kildare, Ireland, the second son of John Henry Edward Fock, fourth Baron de Robeck (1823&#150;1904), and his wife, Zo&euml; Sophia Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1903), the third daughter of William Fitzwilliam Burton of co. Carlow. The family title was Swedish, stemming from John Henry Fock, Baron de Robeck (1755&#150;1817), who was naturalized by act of parliament in 1785 and settled in Ireland.<br>
<br>De Robeck entered the navy as a cadet on <i>Britannia</i> in 1875, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1885, commander in 1897, and captain in 1902. His early naval career was unremarkable and included service in Chinese, North American, and Mediterranean waters and two tours of duty in <i>Britannia</i>. He appears to have had a flair for training and was considered a natural leader, handsome in appearance, gentlemanly in manner, and noted for his love of sports in all forms. De Robeck was inspecting captain of boys' training establishments from February to December 1911 and after promotion to rear-admiral in December 1911 was appointed admiral of patrols. De Robeck was the first to command (April 1912 to May 1914) this newly created organization that included four patrol flotillas (three of destroyers and one of torpedo-boats) and the majority of submarines.<br>
<br>De Robeck was on half pay when the war began and was recalled to command the 9th cruiser squadron, a force of elderly cruisers taken up from the reserve and assigned the Cape Finisterre station. In January 1915 he was transferred from this obscure post and made second in command of the eastern Mediterranean squadron with his flag in the battleship <i>Vengeance</i>. The squadron, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Sackville Carden, was originally to play the primary role in the Dardanelles campaign, charged with reducing the Turkish forts at the entrance to the Dardanelles and opening the straits to the passage of allied warships. The bombardment of the Turkish defences began in February but Carden's health soon broke down under the strain and he was forced to relinquish his command. Under the rules of seniority, command should now have gone to Rear-Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, then senior naval officer, Mudros. However, Wemyss declined because he regarded de Robeck as better suited since he had been so closely involved in the planning and execution of the attack. De Robeck, promoted to acting vice-admiral, shifted his flag to the new super-dreadnought <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and found himself in a position of great responsibility, one of the handful of men who might truly influence the outcome of the war. He inherited Carden's staff, whose chief was Commodore Roger Keyes, a fiery partisan of a properly executed naval offensive.<br>
<br>The naval bombardments gradually reduced the majority of Turkish fixed defences&#151;although not the mobile howitzer batteries&#151;but the major Anglo-French naval attack on 18 March was a failure, largely owing to an undetected line of Turkish mines that sank two British and one French battleships. De Robeck was at first ready to renew the attack, convinced that the Turkish batteries could be dominated after a few hours bombardment thereby permitting the sweepers to clear the mines. Here he was probably acting under the influence of Keyes and others on the staff, notably the Royal Marines war staff officer Captain William W. Godfrey. However, de Robeck reconsidered and on 22 March recommended waiting until the army, then concentrating on the nearby island of Lemnos, landed and seized the commanding heights on the Gallipoli peninsula. The divergence between de Robeck and Keyes on the subject of a renewed naval attack would be lasting.<br>
<br>The landing at heavy cost on 25 April did not yield the desired results. This raised the question of another naval attack. De Robeck's cable to the Admiralty on the subject was couched in terms a disappointed Keyes regarded as an attempt to shift responsibility on to the Admiralty if they ordered him to attack. De Robeck's task was immensely complicated by the arrival of German submarines at the Dardanelles. The <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was ordered home and de Robeck shifted to the semi-dreadnought <i>Lord Nelson</i> and then to the converted yacht <i>Triad</i>, better suited for shuttling between the nearby islands and the beaches. A new landing in August at Suvla again failed to break through. The autumn brought a fresh crisis when Bulgaria entered the war on the side of Germany, leading within a few weeks to the collapse of Serbia and the imminent opening of direct rail communications between Germany and Constantinople, permitting the unimpeded flow of heavy ammunition to the beleaguered Turks. The belated attempt to save Serbia resulted in the opening of the Macedonian front, an additional responsibility for de Robeck. The onset of autumn storms also added to the difficulty of supplying the army over open beaches. It was clearly the crisis of the campaign. The government wavered. Keyes, with thoroughly reorganized sweeping and offensive forces, including specially bulged ships to minimize mine damage, prepared plans for a new naval attack to save the campaign. De Robeck allowed him to go home in late October to plead his case, emphasizing to the first lord that there was no ill will between them and that he had always encouraged his officers to state their views candidly. It was sporting gestures such as these that made de Robeck so popular in the navy, but he was also careful to counter Keyes with a private letter to the first lord recommending against attack. De Robeck went beyond the argument that the stakes were high enough to risk the loss of a few obsolescent ships if it would lead to capture of the great prize&#151;Constantinople. The problem in de Robeck's mind was that even if the fleet got through the narrows and anchored off Constantinople it would not necessarily mean that the Turks would surrender. The fleet would then have the problem of being supplied by vulnerable unarmoured ships through the narrows where the Turk would still hold the commanding heights. It was de Robeck who would have the responsibility and he stuck to his guns, praised by some such as Admiral Limpus, admiral-superintendent at Malta, who was thankful he was strong enough to say no.<br>
<br>The strain of command and responsibility were telling on de Robeck and by autumn he was suffering from chronic insomnia and neuralgia. His health became so bad that he was forced to take a brief leave in England in late November, leaving Wemyss as senior naval officer. Wemyss and Keyes, who had returned to the Aegean, made a desperate effort for a renewed naval attack and to prevent an evacuation. It was futile, the government decided on evacuation. De Robeck returned to the Aegean just after the successful completion of the evacuation of Suvla and Anzac by dawn on 20 December. He credited Wemyss and Keyes with excellent organization, but deplored their campaign in his absence for a renewed attack. However, he had not the heart to send Keyes away but contented himself with a heart to heart talk telling him he must in the future be a chief of staff and not &#145;leader of the opposition&#146;. Again it was a grand sporting gesture.<br>
<br>De Robeck returned from England a new man, fit and able to sleep. He had been freed of the dreadful responsibility of a new attack on the straits. De Robeck completed the successful evacuation of the final bridgehead at Cape Helles the night of 8&#150;9 January 1916. His command in the Aegean was now steadily diminished as ships were recalled to home waters. There were still a multitude of complications with the French, Greeks, military authorities, and the threat of German submarines, but for him the remainder of the war was really an anticlimax. He relinquished the Aegean command in June 1916 and returned to England to command the 3rd battle squadron (<i>Dreadnought</i> and the pre-dreadnought <i>King Edward VII</i>-class battleships) at the Nore. In November 1916 he took command of the 2nd battle squadron in the Grand Fleet with his flag in <i>King George V</i>. He struggled with the Admiralty over the seemingly inadequate rewards given to his eastern Mediterranean command after the Dardanelles campaign and in 1917 also testified before the Dardanelles Commission.<br>
<br>De Robeck was created a baronet in 1919, received a grant of &pound;10,000, and was created a GCB and GCMG in the honours awarded after the armistice. In July 1919 he became commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean with his flag in the battleship <i>Iron Duke</i>. He also acted as British high commissioner at Constantinople and was promoted to admiral in March 1920. Once again he had significant responsibilities, diplomatic and political as well as naval, as resurgent Turkish nationalism and resistance to the terms of the original peace treaty created the possibility of further fighting.<br>
<br>De Robeck left the Mediterranean in May 1922 and in July married Hilda Maud (<i>d</i>. 1944), the widow of Colonel Sir Simon Macdonald Lockhart bt, and daughter of Colonel Augustus Henry Moreton-Macdonald of Bembridge, Isle of Wight. They had no children.<br>
<br>De Robeck's last active service was command of the Atlantic Fleet (August 1922 to August 1924). He was created a GCVO and promoted to admiral of the fleet in November 1925. He died on 20 January 1928 at his home, 2 Southwick Crescent, Hyde Park, London, and the truly impressive and well-attended funeral at Bembridge, Isle of Wight, four days later, and concurrent memorial service at Westminster Abbey were evidence of the wide esteem in which he was held.<br>
<br>De Robeck will always be remembered as one of the great &#145;might have beens&#146; of history, forever linked with the Dardanelles campaign. He did not, either by choice or premature death, write his memoirs and so has tended to suffer from the persuasive writing of men such as Churchill and Keyes who believed he had missed a great opportunity by not renewing a naval attack. On the other hand, he might well have avoided a costly failure. This is an argument that can never be answered&#151;was he a man who squandered a priceless opportunity or a strong man who had the courage to say no?<br>
