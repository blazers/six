<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em> the Inspector]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1714, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">physician and actor</span>, second surviving and fourth-born son of Theophilus Hill (1680&#150;1746) and his wife, Ann Susannah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Yorke), was baptized on 17 November 1714, probably in the region of Peterborough. Hill's father, who had a Cambridge medical degree, climbed the clerical ladder at Peterborough Cathedral from prebend in 1710, to minor clerk in 1719, and canon in 1720, before resigning seven years later in favour of his first-born son, Theophilus (<i>b</i>. 1706); he later became curate of Denham parish in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Little is known of John Hill's early years before he was apprenticed to the London apothecary Edward Angier in 1730&#150;31. One source current until the late nineteenth century held that he was a strolling player from 1730 to 1735, but this is unsubstantiated. However, Hill's fascination with the theatre is definite, vying with his interest in botany as chief among his lifelong preoccupations. In 1738 he started collecting specimens for Lord Petre, and at some point between then and 1742 he married Susannah Travers, daughter of the steward of Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, though no record of the marriage survives. Hill worked as an apothecary in a shop close to the Strand, London, and during the years 1739&#150;40 the second duke of Richmond, Lennox, and Aubigny commissioned Hill (probably as a result of an introduction from Petre) to collect specimens for him from England and Wales. This relationship continued into 1741, with Hill taking up residence at Goodwood House, the Sussex seat of the Richmonds. At Goodwood, a fashionable seat of learning, literature, and theatre (the castle boasted its own theatre), Hill met a number of the theatrical community including Owen MacSwinney, David Garrick (then at the beginning of his career), and Peg Woffington. Hill acted on the Goodwood stage, continued to collect botanical specimens, and wrote his <span class="italic">Orpheus, an Opera</span>. On 2 July 1742 Petre died, making Richmond Hill's sole employer. During his flirtation with theatricals at Goodwood, Hill became infatuated with Peg Woffington, who did not return his feelings. By 1743 Hill had finally broken away from Goodwood and settled in Westminster, retaining his interest in his original apothecary shop. Perhaps inspired by the new wave of &#145;natural&#146; acting given vogue by Garrick in the 1740s, Hill went on to act in several plays, putatively at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. He studied acting with Charles Macklin and in 1744 played Lodovico in his <span class="italic">Othello</span> at the &#145;little theatre&#146; in the Haymarket. Hill &#145;seems to have been the only person who regarded the experiment as a success&#146;  (Duerr, 241).<br>
<br>During this time in London, Hill began seriously to promote and expand his interest in natural science, becoming acquainted with significant naturalists and fellows of the Royal Society such as Martin Folkes, Sir Hans Sloane, Henry Baker, William Watson, and James Parsons. Hill's scientific publications consequently began to grow and multiply. In 1746 he published Theophrastus's <span class="italic">History of Stones</span> in addition to two papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. Despite his publications and circle of friends, Hill's attempts to join the Royal Society in 1747 failed. Notwithstanding, in 1748 he published a <span class="italic">History of Fossils</span> and translated Pomet's <span class="italic">Complete History of Drugs</span>. In 1749 he assumed two editorships: of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (anonymously), and of the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span>, in which his column &#145;The original spectator&#146; was carried over from the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. As an editor he was responsible for reducing the use of capitals and thereby reforming the prevailing eighteenth-century style and taste in such matters.<br>
<br>Hill's <span class="italic">The Actor</span> appeared in 1750. It was the first English acting treatise to discuss the personal and emotional attributes of the actor rather than the rhetorical conventions of performance that had characterized earlier acting manuals. <span class="italic">The Actor</span> was a thinly disguised adaptation of a French original, <span class="italic">Le com&eacute;dien</span> by Pierre R&eacute;mond de Sainte-Albine. (The second edition of <span class="italic">The Actor</span> in 1755 expanded on the first, making more extensive reference to the English stage; this version was translated back into French by Antonio Sticotti as <span class="italic">Garrick, ou, Les acteurs anglais</span> and influenced Denis Diderot's <span class="italic">Paradoxe sur le com&eacute;dien</span>.) Also in 1750 Hill published two satires on the Royal Society (<span class="italic">Lucine sine concubitu</span> and <span class="italic">A Dissertation on Royal Societies</span>), sinking his hopes of ever being elected. Despite this deeply resented set-back (and perhaps because of it), Hill continued to publish prolifically in the sciences. In 1751 <span class="italic">A Review of the Works of the Royal Society</span>, <span class="italic">A History of the Materia medica</span>, and <span class="italic">A History of Plants</span> appeared. These were joined by non-scientific titles such as <span class="italic">The Adventures of Mr George Edwards</span> and <span class="italic">The History of a Woman of Quality</span>. Moreover, on 5 March of this year, his column in <span class="italic">The London Daily Advertiser and Literary Gazette</span> announced him to the world as &#145;the Inspector&#146;, a journalistic cognomen by which he became universally recognized, especially among the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the Bedford Coffee House. Hill also acquired an MD degree from the University of St Andrews. In 1752 his <span class="italic">Essays in Natural History and Philosophy</span> completed the third volume of his system of the natural world, <span class="italic">A History of Animals</span>. Some time during that year Hill moved to 12 Hart Street, Bloomsbury, London.<br>
<br>The next year marked a departure on Hill's part away from scientific publications, perhaps because he had stopped collecting specimens. A miscellany of works materialized, including: <span class="italic">The Conduct of a Married Life</span>, <span class="italic">Observations on the Greek and Roman Classics</span>, and <span class="italic">The Story of Elizabeth Canning</span>, the last being based upon a contemporary incident concerning a servant girl (Canning) who went missing for twenty-eight days citing abduction for the purposes of prostitution. Hill opposed strongly the view of Henry Fielding, who considered the girl's story to be truthful. Hill then engaged with Fielding in a pamphlet war. Like all men of principle, Hill had a penchant for making powerful enemies, especially among the <i>literati</i> (Smollett and Richardson, for example). Hill was also satirized as an &#145;archdunce&#146; in &#145;The Hilliad: an Epick Poem&#146;, having made an enemy of its author, Christopher Smart.<br>
<br>During 1753 Hill wrote his last &#145;Inspector&#146; column, and married for the second time. In September 1753 Henrietta Wilhelmina Jones (<i>d</i>. 1789), the sister of Charles Jones, fourth Viscount Ranelagh, became Hill's wife at St George's Chapel, Hyde Park, London.<br>
<br>Despite being pursued by publishers, Hill had an unaccountably unproductive year in 1754. Garrick (at Drury Lane) and John Rich (at Covent Garden) refused Hill's <span class="italic">The Critical Minute: a Farce</span>. However, Hill managed to publish <span class="italic">Urania</span>, a dictionary of astronomy, and <span class="italic">The Useful Family Herbal</span>. His output in 1755 was more prolific, with the publication of <span class="italic">Thoughts Concerning God and Nature</span>, <span class="italic">The British Herbal</span>, and second editions of <span class="italic">The Actor</span> and <span class="italic">The Useful Family Herbal</span>. His <span class="italic">Naval History of Britain</span> (1756) made a timely appearance just before the commencement of the Seven Years' War. Hill's writing continued apace: 1757 saw his attentions turn once more to the sciences, with <span class="italic">Eden, or, A Compleat Body of Gardening</span> and <span class="italic">The Sleep of Plants, and Cause of Motion in the Sensitive Plant</span>. Hill finally secured the patronage of Lord Bute and published a long list of titles, including: <span class="italic">The Construction of the Nerves</span>, <span class="italic">The Virtues of Wild Valerian</span>, <span class="italic">An Idea of a Botanical Garden in England</span>, <span class="italic">The Management of the Gout</span>, <span class="italic">The History of Insects</span>, <span class="italic">A Method of Producing Double Flowers</span>, and <span class="italic">The Gardener's New Calendar</span>. All were published in 1758. He also made another sally at entering the theatre world with his farce <span class="italic">The Rout</span>, which proved to be prophetically titled, with Garrick breaking off for ever with Hill in 1759. In that year too, at the instigation of his patron Bute, Hill began his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span> (1759&#150;75), a work which eventually ran to twenty-six volumes. The work cost Hill a considerable amount of money, some of which he recouped through the sale of herbal medicines such as &#145;the essence of water-dock&#146;, &#145;tincture of valerian&#146;, and &#145;pectoral balsalm of honey&#146;. Other botanical titles of 1759 included <span class="italic">Virtues of Honey</span>, <span class="italic">Usefulness of Knowledge of Plants</span>, <span class="italic">Proliferous Flowers</span>, and <span class="italic">A Practice of Gardening</span>. In this year too he published his <span class="italic">Cautions Against the Immoderate Use of Snuff</span>, a curiously prescient tract which associates tobacco with cancerous growths. Hill also bought a property in Bayswater, London, and began to help Bute to lay out Kew Gardens. His <span class="italic">Flora Britanica</span>, published in the same year, was the first Linnaean flora of Britain. Although volumes one and two of <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span> were published in 1761, Bute was becoming less and less involved in the project as his star rose (to prime minister in 1762) and fell (in 1763, when he was out of office). As a result of the impact of <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span> on the continent, Hill found himself corresponding with European scientists such as Haller and Gesner. He became ill in 1764, perhaps from the effects of gout and dropsy; his <span class="italic">Centaury, the Great Stomachic</span>, a book of herbal remedies, followed in 1765, and in 1766 he published <span class="italic">Hypochondriasis, a Practical Treatise on the Nature and Cure of that Disorder</span>.<br>
<br>Ever-straitening financial circumstances in 1767 spurred Hill to export his herbal remedies to the American colonies. Among his publications the following year were: <span class="italic">A Method of Curing Jaundice</span>, <span class="italic">Polypody</span>, <span class="italic">Hortus Kewensis</span>, and <span class="italic">A New Astronomical Dictionary</span>. However, Hill's scientific reputation was not enhanced by suspicions at home and abroad by those who found it difficult to cope with his &#145;distorted mind and personality&#146;  (Rousseau, xxxii). Failing health brought Hill close to death, and he made a will on 1 January 1769. Fully recovered in the spring he researched his <span class="italic">Construction of Timber</span>; volume fourteen of <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span> was published and he commenced work on the next volume. The <span class="italic">Family Practice of Physic</span> and <span class="italic">Herbarium Britannicum</span> followed at the end of the summer. In 1770 Hill lived almost exclusively at his house in Bayswater surrounded by his plants and herbs, quitting but not disposing of his property in St James's (Arlington Street). The <span class="italic">Vegetable System</span> grew to volumes fifteen and sixteen, and Hill continued to correspond with Carl Linnaeus and Albrecht von Haller, exciting the German's praise in particular for <span class="italic">The Construction of Timber</span>. <span class="italic">Cautions Against the Use of Violent Medicines in Fevers</span>, and <span class="italic">Fossils Arranged According to their Obvious Characters</span> also appeared in 1771. In the following year, Hill sent Linnaeus a copy of <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span> and found himself being presented at the Swedish court (not for the first time), where he was in good standing. <span class="italic">Sparogenesia, or, The Origin and Nature of Spar</span> appeared the same year.<br>
<br>In 1773, despite being handicapped by a return of ill health, Hill nevertheless managed to publish volumes twenty-one to twenty-two of <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span>, in addition to <span class="italic">Twenty-Five New Plants</span>, <span class="italic">A Decade of Curious and Elegant Trees</span>, and <span class="italic">Plain and Useful Directions for those who are Afflicted with Cancers</span>. In 1774 he was awarded the order of Vasa by Gustavus III of Sweden, which honour was conferred at the English court some time between 1 and 10 June. The last year of Hill's life, 1775, saw the publication of the final volumes of <span class="italic">The Vegetable System</span>, in addition to <span class="italic">Inquiries into the Nature of a New Mineral Acid Discover'd in Sweden</span> and <span class="italic">Circumstances which Preceded the Letters of the Earl of Mexborough</span>. Following further travels to the Netherlands, Hill returned to England because of continuing sickness. He died at his home in Golden Square, London, on Wednesday 22 November 1775, and was buried at Denham in Buckinghamshire; no monument remains. A will and testament of 8 November names his wife and Martha Constance Hardy as his executors. The year after Hill's death, his wife undertook to extract from Lord Bute the thousands of pounds which were allegedly promised to Hill. In 1788, after unsuccessfully pursuing litigation against Bute, she published <span class="italic">An address to the public, by the Honble Lady Hill; setting forth the consequences of the late Sir John Hill's acquaintance with the earl of Bute</span>, trying him in the court of public opinion and ascribing to him the loss of her husband's health and fortune. In 1779 <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Life, Writings and Character of the Late Sir John Hill, MD</span> was published. After the death of Hill's widow in 1789, their daughter and sole executor, Juliana, acquired Hill's medical papers and secret herbal preparations. She sold the latter to the druggist Benjamin Shaw in 1802.<br>
<br>Given that his knighthood was a foreign award, Hill was something of a prophet without honour in his own land. He enjoyed the company of influential people but infrequently won their favour and loyalty. Indeed he was generally reviled in his day. Hogarth included Hill in his basket of hated works in his &#145;Beer Street&#146; satire. Garrick famously remarked of him: &#145;For Physick and Farces, his Equal there scarce is, His Farces are Physick, and his Physick a Farce is&#146;  (Little and Kahrl, 1.299). In <span class="italic">The Rosciad</span>, Charles Churchill satirized Hill as a &#145;Proteus&#146;<blockquote>
<div>For who, like him, his various pow'rs could call<br>
</div>
<div>Into so many shapes, and shine in all?<br>
</div>
<div>Who could so nobly grace the motley list,<br>
</div>
<div>Actor, Inspector, Doctor, Botanist?<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Rosciad</span>, 69)</blockquote>However, behind these disparagements lie unintended compliments. In Garrick's epigram there is the admission that Hill was without equal; and in Churchill's lines there is the recognition that Hill truly had a wide-ranging, protean curiosity. According to Samuel Johnson, &#145;Dr Hill was &hellip; a very curious observer; and if he had been contented to tell the world no more than he knew, he might have been a very considerable man&#146;  (Boswell, 383). But Hill did not know when to temporize, nor did he suffer fools gladly. Slender, and close to 6 feet in height, Hill was a tall poppy ripe for cutting down, and the age in which he lived obliged. His reputation has been somewhat reclaimed since. At the end of the millennium, Hill was recognized as less of a quack and dilettante, and, to use George Rousseau's phrase, more &#145;a type of Renaissance man in the eighteenth century&#146;  (Hill, ix).<br>
