<span class="headword">Fiennes,  John</span>, appointed Lord Fiennes under the protectorate  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1710), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9415/', "William Fiennes, eighth baron and first Viscount Saye and Sele (1582&#150;1662)")</script>, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of John Temple of Burton Dasset, Warwickshire. Nothing is known of his early years or education, but at the outbreak of civil war he commanded a troop of horse in the army of the earl of Essex. He took part with his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9413/', "Nathaniel Fiennes")</script> in the unsuccessful attack on Worcester in September 1642, and in February 1643 was sent with him to garrison Bristol. In the spring of that year he served under Colonel Massey, the governor of Gloucester. He had returned to Bristol by the time of its surrender in June 1643; he defended his brother's conduct in capitulating, and assaulted one of the witnesses against him for impugning it. Some time during summer 1643 he obtained a commission as colonel of a regiment of horse, and is henceforth recorded as prominent in the civil war in the district round Oxford. He besieged Banbury from 27 August 1644 to 25 October of the same year, when the siege was raised by the earl of Northampton and Colonel Gage. In April 1645 Fiennes was for a time under the command of Cromwell, who specially commended him in a letter to the committee of both kingdoms of 28 April 1645:<blockquote>his diligence was great, and this I must testify, that I find no man more ready to all services than himself &hellip; I find him a gentleman of that fidelity to you and so conscientious, that he would all his troop were as religious and civil as any, and makes it a great part of his care to get them so. (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 1.343)</blockquote>At the battle of Naseby he fought on the right wing, under the command of Cromwell, and was entrusted with the duty of conducting the royalist prisoners to London. He was elected MP for Morpeth in Northumberland in 1645, bringing an end to his military career. Although he supported the army in its struggle with parliament in 1647 he stayed away from parliament after Pride's Purge of the following year.<br>
<br>In 1657 Fiennes was summoned by Cromwell to his other house, having been appointed a councillor of state earlier that year. A republican pamphleteer describes him as &#145;such a one as they call a sectary, but no great stickler&#146;, and adds that he was entirely under the influence of his brother Nathaniel  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 4.604n.). He survived the Restoration in 1660 and escaped all penalties for his political conduct, being included in the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. At an unknown date he married Susannah (1656/7&#150;1715), daughter of Thomas Hobbs of Amwell Magna in Hertfordshire. Their fifth but only surviving son, Lawrence, succeeded his cousin Nathaniel as fifth Viscount Saye and Sele in January 1710, by which date Fiennes had died. His wife died at Bath on 22 July 1715, aged fifty-eight, and was buried at Broughton, Oxfordshire.<br>
