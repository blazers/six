<span class="headword">King,  Thomas  Chiswell</span>  (1818&#150;1893), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at Twyning, near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, on 24 April 1818. He adopted his wife's maiden name of Chiswell in addition to his own name on his marriage, which took place shortly after he joined the theatrical profession. He was apprenticed in his youth to a painting and paper-hanging business in Cheltenham, and acquired a taste for the stage through acting with amateurs. About 1840 he joined the company of the ballad composer Alexander Lee to support Harriett Waylett in one-act dramas and operettas in Cheltenham, Worcester, Warwick, and Leamington Spa. In 1843 he became attached in a subordinate capacity to the Simpson&#150;Munro company at Birmingham, playing Conrade in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> and Sir Thomas Fairfax in <span class="italic">The Field of the Forty Footsteps</span>. The following year he was seen as Young Scrooge in <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span>, in which his wife played Fezziwig.<br>
<br>King made rapid progress in his profession, and by August 1847 was playing leading business on the York circuit under J. L. Pritchard. He went on to Gourlay's Victoria Theatre, Edinburgh, in June 1848, and remained there for four months. In November 1848 he joined W. H. Murray's company at the Theatre Royal in the same city, where he appeared as Sir Richard Wroughton in <span class="italic">The Jacobite</span>. In April 1850 he supported Charles Kean during the latter's visit to Edinburgh, and was engaged by him to play secondary tragic parts during the opening season of his management in London.<br>
<br>King made his d&eacute;but at the Princess's in October 1850, as Bassanio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and subsequently played the King in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>. In January 1851 he was seen as the exiled Duke when <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> was performed before the queen at Windsor. Late in the year he was engaged by John Harris of Dublin as leading actor at the Theatre Royal there. He opened under the new management as Colonel Buckthorne in Boucicault's <span class="italic">Love in a Maze</span>, and soon became an abiding favourite with Dublin playgoers. He remained in the city for five seasons and appeared in no fewer than fifteen notable Shakespearian productions: his Macbeth, Master Ford, Hotspur, and Leontes met with much approbation. During 1855 he was in leading support to Helen Faucit, Samuel Phelps, and Isabella Glyn during their visits to Dublin. In March 1856 he abruptly left the Theatre Royal, and in April began a three-week engagement in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> at the Queen's Theatre, Dublin. In October 1856 he opened at Birmingham with Isabella Glyn. King remained there after her departure, and was seen as John Mildmay in Tom Taylor's comedy <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span> and as Quasimodo in <span class="italic">Esmeralda</span>. In July 1857 he made his first appearance in Manchester. After returning to Birmingham he appeared as Mephistopheles in Boucicault's version of <span class="italic">Faust and Marguerite</span>, which ran for forty-eight nights at a great profit. During 1859 he fulfilled several engagements at the Queen's Theatre, Dublin, and also played at the City of London Theatre as Hamlet.<br>
<br>From 1861 to 1868 King's record was one of splendid strolling. In March 1869 he was given a trial engagement at Drury Lane by F. C. Chatterton, and opened there as Richelieu to the Julie de Mortemar of his daughter Bessie, who was making her London d&eacute;but. He was favourably received, and subsequently played Hamlet and Julian St Pierre, besides alternating Othello and Iago with Charles Dillon. At the same house in 1870 he was the original Varney in Andrew Halliday's <span class="italic">Amy Robsart</span>. At Easter 1871 he moved to the Adelphi, where he originated the role of Quasimodo in Halliday's version of <span class="italic">Notre Dame</span>, which ran for most of the year.<br>
<br>King made his American d&eacute;but on 11 September 1873 at the Lyceum Theatre, New York, as Quasimodo. The play did not repeat its Adelphi success, although it was performed for six weeks. Afterwards he made a successful tour of Canada, exclusively in Shakespearian plays, and returned to New York and the Lyceum in March 1874.<br>
<br>From 1878 to 1880 King leased the Worcester theatre, an unprofitable speculation. In 1883 he made a short provincial tour under J. Pitt Hardacre's management, but he had outlived his popularity. He was the last exponent of an increasingly unpopular school of acting which subordinated intelligence to precept and tradition. Later appearances were infrequent, but in July 1890 he performed for six nights to good houses at the Queen's Theatre, Manchester, and was much admired as Ingomar, one of his most characteristic roles. He retired finally to King's Heath, Worcestershire, where he died on 21 October 1893. He was buried at Claines, near Worcester. He had a son and two daughters, all of whom took to the stage, his elder daughter, Bessie King, being the most successful.<br>
<br>A sound second-rank tragedian, King had a tall and shapely figure, with dark expressive features and well-set eyes. His rich bass voice was flexible and resonant. A temperate, graceful actor, he had more individuality and fewer vices of style than most conventional tragedians. He never established his hold in London, but in one or two sizeable provincial centres, notably Dublin and Birmingham, his following was large and affectionate.<br>
