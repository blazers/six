<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marchant,  Nathaniel</span>  (1738/9&#150;1816), <span class="occ">gem-engraver and medallist</span>, came from a family long-established in the village of Mayfield, Sussex. Details of his parentage and birth are obscure, although he was possibly the son of another Nathaniel Marchant (<i>b</i>. 1702), at one time an apprentice watchmaker. Marchant was recorded in 1761 as the winner of a premium for gem-engraving offered by the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, and gained three further premiums in successive years, making him the foremost prize-winner in this field. As prescribed by the society, his winning entries were intaglios reproducing casts from ancient statues in the third duke of Richmond's gallery, where artists were trained in copying from the antique. Until 1765 he was the apprentice of Edward Burch, a fellow prize-winner, whom he joined that year as an exhibitor with the Society of Artists, showing copies of his prize-winning gems. He exhibited his intaglios there until 1768 and remained loyal to the society even after Burch's defection to the Royal Academy, but from 1769 he showed only wax models for future gems and casts from those completed, an indication that the originals were already sold; his <span class="italic">Garrick with the Bust of Shakespeare</span> became a best-seller in Wedgwood's copy.<br>
<br>The most important of Marchant's early patrons was George Spencer, fourth duke of Marlborough, a passionate gem collector, whose help was probably material in enabling Marchant to travel to Rome to fulfil his ambition to study original works of the ancients <i>in situ</i>. He set out in 1772; his last exhibition entry for the society, sent two years later, was pointedly described as &#145;after the original head of the Antinous in the Villa Albano, near Rome&#146; (exh. Society of Artists, 1774). Henceforth he devoted himself almost entirely to copying Rome's antiquities on his intaglio sealstones. From 1774 to 1786 he lived and worked in via Babuino, in the middle of the artists' and antiquaries' quarter, then until 1788 in strada Felice (later via Sistina) on the healthier heights near Trinit&agrave; de' Monti. He kept up his connection with the duke conscientiously, informing him about the availability of ancient gems and offering him and other collectors at home his own newly engraved stones; but having attracted the attention of important antiquaries and dealers, he soon found new commissions in Italy itself. His exquisitely engraved gems were sought especially by grand tourists as mementoes of their visits; he also practised very successfully a second popular genre, cutting very accomplished portraits from life, such as that of Emma Hart, later Lady Hamilton (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and came to be considered the only rival to the pre-eminent Giovanni Pichler. From 1781 he began to send gems for exhibition in the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>The Roman diaries and correspondence of Lord Herbert (later eleventh earl of Pembroke) and his circle paint a vivid picture of Marchant's painstaking, thoughtful approach to the lengthy process of engraving and his self-confidence as an artist: &#145;I have kept the work as light as possible in imitation of the best Greek gems&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry, Elizabeth and George</span>, 487). As his fame grew he received commissions from European and British royalty and nobility, and was allowed to model the pope from life, but it was among the British visitors that he found not only patrons but influential friends, moving with remarkable ease in high society. He seems to have benefited from good schooling: he wrote fluent letters in a practised hand, made a point of learned quotations in his published <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, and acquired a reputation in Rome for connoisseurship as well as his art. In 1788, after a sojourn of sixteen years, he was at last ready to return home, confidently expecting to build on his fame and his connections.<br>
<br>Settling in Bond Street, Marchant renewed links with artist friends, most now members of the Royal Academy, and was elected an associate in 1791. The following year he exhibited the casts from 100 of his finest gems, a catalogue of which he was preparing for publication; though virtually all after antiquities, he included his masterly essay in modern history, <span class="italic">General Wolfe, Receiving the News of the Victory, as he was Expiring</span> (Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire). The <span class="roman">catalogue</span> (1792) meticulously documented the ancient models for his stones, together with the names of their prestigious owners: the project attracted 446 subscribers, at their head the prince of Wales and the duke of Gloucester. He received some further important commissions and was elected to membership of the academies of Vienna, Stockholm, and Copenhagen, but to his continuing disappointment, as vividly described in Joseph Farington's diary, the Royal Academy dragged its feet: he had to wait until he was seventy years of age before he was at last elected.<br>
<br>Marchant was, however, appointed to the Royal Mint in 1797 as probationer and later assistant engraver; in 1799 he became senior engraver to the stamp office, which provided him with elegant accommodation in Somerset House. In 1801 he was named his majesty's engraver of seals. Marchant fulfilled his duties conscientiously, although in later years in indifferent health; in 1815 he was superannuated, suffering from a lengthy and debilitating illness. He died a wealthy man, unmarried, on 24 March 1816 at his home, New Somerset House, Somerset Place, and was buried in Stoke church, Buckinghamshire, where he is commemorated by an inscribed memorial by his friend John Flaxman. His contemporary fame as the foremost recorder in miniature of Rome's antiquities is enshrined in the many souvenir collections of its sights, in the form of plaster casts from gemstones, produced for gentlemen's libraries; his reputation as one of the finest glyptic artists of the eighteenth-century revival, equally brilliant in classical subjects and in portraiture, has endured. A representative group of his gems in the British Museum includes the noble portrait <span class="italic">George John, Second Earl Spencer</span> and an exquisite <span class="italic">Bacchus and a Bacchante</span>. Plaster impressions are held by the Society of Antiquaries of London; Sir John Soane's Museum, London; Mompesson House, Salisbury, Wiltshire, and Kingston Lacy, Dorset; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
