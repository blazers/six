<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bruce,  Edward</span>, earl of Carrick  (<em>c.</em>1280&#150;1318), <span class="occ">soldier and claimant to the Irish throne</span>, was the third, or possibly fourth, son of Robert VI de Brus (<i>d</i>. 1304), son of the claimant for the Scottish throne, and Marjory, countess of Carrick. He had two older brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3754/', "Robert (King Robert I)")</script>, and Neil, and was probably older than Alexander and Thomas; he also had four sisters, the oldest, Isabel, married to Erik II, king of Norway.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Bruce's childhood save a hint that for a time he was fostered with an Irish family; in 1304, not yet knighted, he was in the household of Edward, prince of Wales, in Scotland. With the murder of John Comyn in February 1306 and seizure of the Scottish throne by his brother, Robert, he was drawn into the desperate war for the family's right. In the early phase he is depicted by Barbour as being with Robert, but also sent as messenger to Comyn, a task which other sources ascribe to his brothers Thomas and Alexander, never mentioned by Barbour. They, not Edward, were sent to Ireland to bring help, and died on the gibbet for it; his brother Neil, taken at Kildrummy, met the same end. Thus by February 1307 Edward was the sole surviving brother of the king, apparently sticking fairly closely to him during the fraught summer of 1307. A month after the Bruce victory of Inverurie, Edward Bruce led an invasion of Galloway on 21 June 1308 by forces from the western seaboard, suggesting that he had been there since autumn 1307. The campaign was outstandingly successful, with victories at the Cree (against overwhelming odds, according to Barbour) and the Dee; English forces and hostile Galloway kindreds were driven from the west and Buittle became the westernmost English stronghold from 1308 to 1312. As Edward retired north he took Rutherglen.<br>
<br>Bruce appears at the St Andrews parliament of March 1309 as lord of Galloway, but is not prominent in the following years. Strikingly it was Thomas Randolph, not Bruce, whom the king appointed as royal lieutenant, and in 1312 Randolph became earl of Moray before Bruce was given the much smaller earldom of Carrick (1313) with no trace of the regalian powers conferred on Moray. Barbour ascribes to him the taking of Dundee, in early April 1312, but it was surrendered to the king in terms of a prior agreement during a siege, and Bruce's role was probably subordinate.<br>
<br>In 1314, however, Carrick seems to have seized an initiative. The northern English counties had bought a truce to last until 29 September, but Edward II had promised to be in Scotland by 24 June. The king gave Moray the task of taking Edinburgh Castle, but during that siege, on 27 or 28 February 1314, Douglas took Roxburgh Castle by surprise; on receipt of the news the king sent Carrick across country to render its defences ineffective. Then, on 14 March, Edinburgh fell, and, according to the Lanercost chronicle, the Scots marched to set siege to Stirling, a siege which the life of Edward II ascribes to King Robert. Carrick cannot have been with them, for on 16 April with an army he invaded Cumberland, burning towns, killing people, and rustling cattle, all because the blackmail due had fallen into arrears. Barbour is emphatic, however, that the agreement for the surrender of Stirling if not relieved by 24 June, was made by Carrick and forcefully deprecated by the king. Barbour is wildly wrong in ascribing this agreement to the absurd date of Lent 1313; record evidence reveals that it was made about mid-May 1314, which would fit with Carrick's taking over the siege after his Cumbrian campaign. And it looks as though during all these months the king was in uncertain health.<br>
<br>That illness, probably recurrent, had receded when Edward II approached Stirling. The king had placed Carrick in command of one of the three Scottish divisions, and when the battle of Bannockburn opened, it was by an assault of the English van upon Carrick's force. Evidently they held steady and wreaked carnage among the English cavalry, but no individual role is ascribed to Carrick then or in the aftermath, until, about 1 August, he led a large force which devastated Northumberland, took blackmail from Durham, and returned by the west, ravaging sometimes, taking money at others.<br>
<br>Carrick had shown his want of judgement at Stirling, but the return of the king's daughter and her proposed marriage now raised the critical issue of the succession; at an assembly at Ayr on 27 April 1315, it was agreed that Carrick, as &#145;a vigorous man, most highly skilled in warfare for the defence of the freedom of the kingdom, and his heirs male&#146; should succeed the king unless he had a son, but if he did and died, the regent for the child was to be not Carrick but Moray  (Dickinson, Donaldson, and Milne, 1.149&#150;50). In fact Carrick was already in communication with the kings and chiefs of Ulster, with whom it was later said he had been brought up, and the Ayr assembly must have agreed to back his decision to cross, and to drive the English from Ireland, with the aid of Ulster chiefs and recognition of him as king of Ireland.<br>
<br>King Robert and Carrick had always been conscious of the Gaedhealtachd off Britain's western seaboard, seeking allies and troops there in difficult times. Now they committed themselves, with men and supplies from lowland and Gaelic Scotland, to establishing a permanent Bruce kingdom in Ireland, to reconciling the native Irish rulers sufficiently to replace their rivalries with a royal authority strong enough to conquer Dublin and other urban centres of English power. Neither Carrick nor Robert showed the slightest acquaintance with a strategy which might have achieved those ends.<br>
<br>Carrick landed near Carrickfergus on 26 May 1315, with a force which included Moray. In early June (and not, as is often said, in May 1316) he was recognized as king of Ireland, and, after a foolish delay of about a month, he crossed into Airgialla. Outside Ulster he ravaged and burned, pressing south into Louth, then retreating to Coleraine and Connor, where he had an encouraging success in battle against the earl of Ulster and government forces. At the end of that year he again marched south, picking up Moray and reinforcements at Dundalk. Avoiding Dublin he marched through Wicklow, almost into Carlow, and defeated an incompetently led government force at Arscoll (or Skerries) before returning to Ulster in February 1316. About the end of August 1316 he at least secured the surrender of Carrickfergus Castle, probably with King Robert's help, and they both returned to an assembly at Cupar, Fife, on 16 September 1316, where Edward and the Scottish magnates put their seals to an unusual royal charter confirming Moray's possessions; relations between Moray and Carrick seem to have been fraught.<br>
<br>Late in 1316 Edward was back in Ireland, and, confident of the control of the Irish Sea by his privateers, sent a letter which almost defies belief to &#145;all those [in Wales] desiring freedom&#146;. The Welsh and the Scots, &#145;who proceed from one root of origin or kinship and country in the beginning&#146;, have suffered from the oppression of the English. If it is the will of the Welsh, he will carry forward their joint struggle if they will commit to him the prosecution of their cause and the chief lordship which their prince formerly exercised  (<span class="italic">Regesta regum Scottorum</span>, 5, no. 571). About the same time the native Irish of Ulster were preparing their Remonstrance against English misdeeds to Pope John XXII, a document where Edward is invoked as king only at the very end and because he will protect the liberties of the Irish church; he had little support in his &#145;kingdom&#146; and none in Wales.<br>
<br>None the less, in January 1317 King Robert and Moray, committed to the whole enterprise, crossed to Ireland, and with Edward launched an assault on the south. Dublin was in a panic as they approached, but perhaps because the Scots lacked supplies in what were lean years, they made no attempt to seize or besiege it, and the force went on to ravage south and west as far as Limerick and Tipperary, returning north without achieving anything decisive. From the return of Robert and Moray to Scotland in May 1317 a silence falls on Carrick's activities until, in October 1318, probably buoyed by the promise of reinforcements from Scotland, he marched again. Outside Dundalk, at Faughart, a government force under John Bermingham blocked his way. Urged to await reinforcements under King Robert which had just arrived at Carrickfergus, he refused, and without support from the native Irish, most of whom were heartily sick of him, attacked the stronger enemy on 14 October 1318. He was killed, his body decapitated, and the head taken to Edward II by Bermingham. King Robert went home to sort out the succession yet again. There is much colourful detail about the Irish war, but a confusion of the first two campaigns, in Barbour's poem; it is possible that behind this there lies a minstrel's account of Edward Bruce, written in the last year of his life.<br>
<br>The explanation of Barbour for the sorry tale of his end was that Edward found Scotland too small for himself and his brother; Fordun is blunter, claiming that Edward asked Robert for half the Scottish kingdom, and when refused determined to win Ireland. Other sources make much the same comment, bearing out Barbour's judgement that Edward was brave but completely lacking in &#145;mesur&#146;, that moderation which we would call common sense. Even his marital life was a mess. He seems to have been affianced to Isabel, daughter of John, earl of Atholl (executed 1306), probably to mark the earl's commitment to the Bruces in the early summer of 1306; they had a son, Alexander, and they may even have married, as Barbour's confused account claims. If so, the marriage was annulled, for he married another Isabel, daughter of William, earl of Ross. In 1306 William had handed over to the English Elizabeth, queen of Robert I, and may have been responsible for their taking the earl of Atholl. According to the papal dispensation of 1317, the marriage of Edward was arranged to end Ross's feud with the Bruces, and therefore can be dated to the earl's submission to King Robert in October 1308. There were no surviving children. The Atholls bore a lasting grudge against Edward, wherefore Isabel's brother, Earl David, deserted the Bruce cause at a critical moment, the battle of Bannockburn.<br>
<br>Robert I conferred the earldom of Carrick on his own son and heir, David, a practice which the Stewarts later revived, and which continues today. In 1326 or 1327 Isabel of Atholl and her son, <a name="cosubject_53984"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Bruce</span>, earl of Carrick  (<em>d.</em> 1333)<span class="occ"></span>, received grant of lands in Dumfriesshire and later the king gave Alexander, his &#145;nephew&#146;, land in Angus and Wigtownshire. His role, if any, at the end of Robert's reign is obscure, and he is not named as participating in the Weardale campaign of 1327, nor is he a witness to royal charters. On the outbreak of war in 1332, Alexander Bruce seems to have avoided serving in the Guardian's army at Dupplin, but when the newly crowned king, Edward (Balliol), came south to spend Christmas at Annan, Bruce joined him. The party was interrupted by a patriotic assault which killed Henry Balliol, and from which Bruce escaped only because he was recognized by the earl of Moray. By the time Edward III invaded and set siege to Berwick in the summer of 1333, Bruce had been bribed back to loyalty to David II by the conferment of the earldom of Carrick; he was in the Scottish army which, seeking to relieve the town, was thoroughly defeated at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. Carrick was one of five earls killed. He had married Eleanor, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7860/', "Sir Archibald Douglas (&#145;Tyneman&#146;)")</script> and sister of William, first earl of Douglas, but they had no surviving children. She remarried several times and died after 1376.<br>
