<span class="headword">Ogle,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1652/3&#150;<em>c.</em>1692), <span class="occ">wit and gambler</span>, was born the youngest son of a gentleman at Ashburton in Devon, although one early nineteenth-century chapbook states Northampton. He was educated at Exeter, where he was trained in the arts of gentlemanly comportment, and he excelled at those equestrian displays of chivalry known to contemporaries as &#145;riding the great horse&#146;. His father died when he was young, and he inherited nearly &pound;200 per annum upon coming of age, although he quickly dissipated his estate. Immediately afterwards he made his way to London, and gained quick recognition in &eacute;lite circles through surviving two duels with well-known gentlemen. Ogle's ability to manage quarrels with other gentlemen &#145;with discretion as well as courage&#146; soon became public knowledge in London society  (Lucas, 184). He gained thereby instant access to the court of Charles II as a noted &#145;man of spirit&#146;, and was soon known as Jack Ogle or Mad Ogle. His sister also found her way into court society, perhaps as maid of honour to the duchess of York, but most notably as the duke of York's mistress. Her influence helped Ogle obtain a saddle in the 1st troop of Horse Guards under the colonelcy of the duke of Monmouth, and later a position in the life guard of James II.<br>
<br>His extravagancies kept Ogle constantly short of funds to maintain his horse and equipage, but his pranks and humour kept him in favour. He lived in Waterman's Lane, Whitefriars, the area of back alleys notorious to contemporaries as Alsatia. He apparently lost through his wagers on cock-fighting the sums he won at the gaming tables of London's beau monde, and eventually Ogle took to drinking excessive quantities of alcoholic spirits, which is said to have hastened his death at the age of thirty-nine, about 1692.<br>
<br>Ogle was buried in the churchyard of Henley upon Thames in Oxfordshire, but his name long retained currency as a symbol of eccentric profligacy and was often paired with that of John Wilmot, earl of Rochester. The memory of Ogle thus played a part in the eighteenth-century imagination of the reign of Charles II as an age of merry libertinism. Richard Steele reports on tavern talk in Queen Anne's reign in which<blockquote>the greatest wit of our company next myself, frequented in his youth the ordinaries about Charing Cross, and pretends to have been intimate with Jack Ogle &hellip; If any modern wit be mentioned, or any town frolic spoken of, he shakes his head at the dulness of the present age, and tells a story of Jack Ogle.(<span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, no. 132, 11 Feb 1710; Bond, 2.267)</blockquote>Cheap print jest books such as the <span class="italic">Frolicks of Lord Mohun</span> and the <span class="italic">Fancies of King Charles and his Concubines</span> were associated with Ogle's name and his biography was included in Theophilus Lucas's <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Famous Gamesters</span>, as well as Granger's <span class="italic">Biographical History</span> and the <span class="italic">Eccentric Magazine</span>. His portrait was painted and subsequently engraved and collected by connoisseurs of English portraiture.<br>
