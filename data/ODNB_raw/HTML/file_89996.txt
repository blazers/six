<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell, Sir  (Arnold Joseph) Philip</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 35 Shakespeare Road, Bedford, on 15 March 1921, the younger son and one of three children of the Revd (later Canon) Arnold Cecil Powell (1882&#150;1963), headmaster of Bedford Modern School, and his first wife, Mary Winnifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker (<i>d</i>. 1954). He was educated at Epsom College, where his father had become headmaster and where he excelled at languages. His father sent him abroad to improve his French and German after he won an exhibition to read modern languages at Cambridge. But Powell's passion was for architecture, the architecture of the modern movement in particular, and he seized the opportunity to visit recent building projects in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. On his return to Britain he joined the MARS (Modern Architectural Research) Group. Inspired by the example of his brother, Michael (1916&#150;1971), whom he hero-worshipped, he abandoned Cambridge and entered the Architectural Association (AA) school of architecture in London in 1939.<br>
<br>It was at the AA that Powell first met the American-born <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55157/', "John Hidalgo (Jacko) Moya")</script>. During the Second World War both Powell (a pacifist by conviction) and Moya were judged unfit for war service and became friends when Moya (who had entered the AA in the previous year but whose tutors felt he was making poor progress with his studies) was relegated to the first-year unit to which Powell had been allocated. The two men shared a house, first in Hadley Wood, where the AA was evacuated during the war years, and then at 16 the Little Boltons, which for a time was home to a number of young architects, including (the unrelated) Geoffry Powell, later a partner in the practice of Chamberlin, Powell, and Bon. The house was to be Philip Powell's home for the rest of his life. He married Philippa Jane Eccles (<i>d</i>. 2006), a 24-year-old teacher of dancing, and daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Eccles, army officer, on 17 January 1953. They had a son, Ben, and a daughter, Dido.<br>
<br>The practice of Powell and Moya, in which Michael Powell was initially a member before quitting in 1950 to join the London county council architect's department, was founded in 1946 after Philip Powell (who had worked briefly in the office of Frederick Gibberd) and Jacko Moya, both barely qualified, won the competition for a very large housing scheme to be developed by Westminster City Council on a 33 acre site in Pimlico. Churchill Gardens, strongly influenced by Dutch housing projects of the 1930s and by the Stuttgart Weissenhofsiedlung, included nearly 1800 dwellings for around 6500 residents and was built in phases between 1947 and 1962. The development reflected Powell's &#145;mistrust of conscious struggling after originality &hellip; of the monumental approach&#146;  (P. Powell, 116). Combining medium-rise slabs of flats with low-rise terraces&#151;inspired, perhaps, by J. J. P. Oud's housing at the Kiefhoek in Rotterdam&#151;the housing was set in an informal green landscape, a concession to English tradition perhaps, and faced in brick and render rather than exposed concrete. John Summerson complained that &#145;this sort of thing is not London at all&#146;  (K. Powell, 28), but Churchill Gardens wore well, physically and socially, in contrast to many other public housing schemes of the post-war years in which strong architectural form was to the fore and the needs of residents a secondary consideration.<br>
<br>In 1950 Powell and Moya won another prestigious competition, that for a &#145;vertical feature&#146; on the festival of Britain's South Bank site. Both partners had prepared designs, but Moya's, designed with the brilliant engineer Felix Samuely, was the one submitted. The Skylon is remembered as the outstanding landmark of the 1951 festival. It was destroyed after the festival closed, though there were later moves to reconstruct it. The structure was seen, Powell recalled, as a symbol of hope when &#145;everything except hope was strictly rationed&#146;  (K. Powell, 28).<br>
<br>Housing formed a large part of Powell and Moya's workload during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Two houses in Mount Lane, Chichester, were built for Powell's parents (his father had become a canon of the cathedral) and for his sister, Joan Hogg, who had married a naval officer. A striking house at Toy's Hill, Kent, was completed for two spinster sisters in 1955, but by this time the practice was becoming too busy to take on small jobs of this sort. The local authority housing in Lamble Street, Gospel Oak (1951&#150;4), again combined slabs of apartments and low-rise houses and was notable for its response to the existing urban fabric. Like other young practices of the period, Powell and Moya prospered at a time when there was an urgent need for new housing, schools, and hospitals: for more than half a century the partnership worked almost exclusively for the public sector. Mayfield School, Putney, completed in 1956, was one of the first of the new comprehensives and was described by the critic Ian Nairn as &#145;one of the best modern buildings in Britain&#146;  (I. Nairn, <span class="italic">Modern Buildings in London</span>, 1964, 59). The commission for Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon, came to the firm in 1951, though the hospital was not completed until 1960. Wexham Park Hospital in Slough (1966) was notable for its low-rise layout, around a series of courts, the antithesis of many of the super-hospitals of the period. Hospitals thereafter became a mainstay of the practice, dominating its later years to a degree that Powell personally came to regret. The Festival Theatre in Chichester, inspired by the ideas of Tyrone Guthrie, opened in 1962, the first architecturally important post-war theatre in Britain. Laurence Olivier was its first director and later tried, without success, to interest Powell in the National Theatre project, which went to Denys Lasdun.<br>
<br>Powell and Moya's reputation for &#145;gentlemanly&#146; modern design, as Reyner Banham described their approach  (R. Banham, &#145;Nice, modern and British!&#146;, <span class="italic">New Society</span>, 18 July 1974, 160), marrying modernism to a feeling for context and history, was underscored by a series of commissions for additions to Oxford and Cambridge colleges. The first of these projects, occupying a confined backyard site, was completed in 1961 for Brasenose College, Oxford, and was one of the first modernist buildings commissioned by an Oxford college. Residential buildings for Christ Church and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and St John's and Queens' colleges in Cambridge followed. Blue boar quad at Christ Church straddles an ancient wall, retained at the insistence of the architects&#151;Oxford planners would have welcomed the chance to demolish it and widen the adjacent road. The Cripps building at St John's College, Cambridge, was the largest (200 rooms) and most costly of the Oxbridge schemes, faced in travertine and fitted out to a high quality. The picture gallery dropped into the dean's garden at Christ Church (1968) was a favourite project of Powell's (&#145;I like buildings you can't see&#146;, he joked; <span class="italic">The Independent</span>), and one in which he was personally much involved. At Wolfson College, Oxford, Powell and Moya, who had failed to secure work from one of the new universities, built a mini-campus for graduate students, with generous funding from Sir Isaac Wolfson.<br>
<br>Powell and Moya worked together on all projects, Powell tolerating his partner's mercurial character and periods of absence from the office, and combining the role of a lead designer with that of its business strategist. Despite its success, Powell and Moya was never a large practice, though it attracted younger talents including James Gowan, Richard Burton, Paul Koralek, and Richard MacCormac. During the 1970s and 1980s younger partners were brought in, Moya retiring in 1990 and Powell a year later, though acting as a consultant to the practice until 1994. The last project that he oversaw was a series of additions to Great Ormond Street Hospital&#151;which involved physically moving the gem-like Victorian chapel.<br>
<br>Powell and Moya was regarded for more than a decade as perhaps the key British architectural practice; its &#145;pragmatic modernism&#146; (Powell's own description; K. Powell, 30) fell from favour to some degree as younger practices, such as those of Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, came to the fore from the mid-1970s onwards. In fact the newly fashionable high-tech manner was prefigured to some degree by the British pavilion designed by Powell and Moya for the 1970 Expo in Osaka, a pioneering example of a masted structure, and the practice's workload of hospitals and university buildings (in Bristol and London) remained extensive into the 1980s. Though the decade saw a development boom, neither of the founding partners was interested in pursuing commercial work, particularly speculative office schemes, and the Miesian office block located on top of the Museum of London, itself a major project of the 1970s, was not a building of which Powell was proud. There was evidence of some loss of direction in projects of the 1980s, such as the housing scheme in Endell Street, Covent Garden, and the National Westminster Bank on Shaftesbury Avenue. The practice's role in the power station at Heysham, completed in 1986, was merely to provide architectural clothing for a massive piece of engineering. Competition entries for major projects such as the Stuttgart Staatsgalerie (won by James Stirling) and the BBC Radio Centre (which went to Foster) were, disappointingly, unplaced. The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, occupying a prominent site opposite Westminster Abbey, was commissioned in 1975 but not completed until 1986, when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. Thatcher disliked the building and said so at a Royal Academy dinner, when she was seated next to Powell, a lifelong socialist who remembered the encounter as &#145;hair-raising&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). Although unapologetically modern in style, the building escaped the attentions of the prince of Wales, whose architectural campaigns were then at their height, and is a polite, though far from insipid, addition to a historic context. From 1987 onwards a number of Powell and Moya buildings were statutorily listed, an outcome that pleased Powell, as did renewed interest in the practice's work on the part of critics, historians, and younger architects. In 2000 Churchill Gardens was selected from over 1000 award-winning projects for the Civic Trust's fortieth anniversary award.<br>
<br>Powell and Moya won the RIBA royal gold medal for architecture in 1974, the first occasion on which the medal had been awarded to a practice rather than an individual. Powell was appointed OBE in 1957, knighted in 1975, and appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984. He became a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission in 1969, serving on it actively for twenty-five years. Elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1972 and an academician in 1977, he served ten years (1975&#150;85) as the academy's treasurer. He was a trustee of Sir John Soane's Museum from 1978 to 2001, typically taking an active interest in the campaign to restore Soane's unique home and museum.<br>
<br>After his retirement from active practice, Powell sat on the juries for a number of major architectural competitions, including those for the Inland Revenue headquarters in Nottingham, the Tate Modern, and the Cardiff Bay opera house (he was dismayed by the subsequent abandonment of the winning scheme by Zaha Hadid), and served for a time as an adviser to the Heritage Lottery Fund. Small in stature&#151;and nicknamed Titch in his youth&#151;Powell was a modest and reticent man, scrupulously polite, not instinctively a lover of the social occasions which his wife, a natural extrovert, relished, but always a generous and attentive host. He lectured rarely and wrote little: &#145;I mistrust architects writing about architecture because I find it so difficult myself&#146;, he told an audience at the RIBA in 1966, finding the writings of his heroes, Corbusier and Wright, &#145;turgid&#146; and &#145;bombastic&#146;  (P. Powell, 116). His genuine interest in encouraging young architects and warm manner in personal encounters made him a popular figure in the profession and earned him the trust and respect of clients. His pastimes, apart from his family, included travel and music, though his commitment to architecture left him little free time. He died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, on 5 May 2003, of heart failure, and was survived by his wife, Philippa, and their two children.<br>
