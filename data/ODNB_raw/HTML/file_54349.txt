<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilding,  Dorothy Frances Edith</span>  (1893&#150;1976), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 10 January 1893 at 5 Westfield Terrace, Longford, Gloucestershire, the youngest of nine children of Richard Wilding, a commercial traveller, and his second wife, Mary Martha Edwards (<i>b</i>. 1866). She was sent to live, aged four, with her childless aunt and uncle Thomas and Fanny Hayter in Cheltenham. Extrovert in character, her early ambitions were to be an actress or a painter.<br>
<br>Through an early interest in picture postcards Wilding, aged only sixteen, bought her first camera and tripod. She moved to London in 1910 and after an apprenticeship with the retoucher Ernest Chandler, who was associated with the fashionable portrait photographer H. Walter Barnett, she managed to save &pound;60 by the time she was twenty-one. With this money she opened her first studio at 67 George Square, just off Portman Square, in 1914.<br>
<br>Building on early success, Wilding moved to a top-floor studio at 264 Regent Street in 1918, employing seven staff to cope with the steadily growing demand for her work. Her loyal and talented staff (almost always women) were to grow in number throughout her career and number nearly forty at her peak during the 1930s. The idiosyncratic Wilding style was adopted by many who worked for her and assistants would be responsible for many famous portraits attributed to her.<br>
<br>A Dorothy Wilding portrait is distinctive not only in style but also in presentation. The photograph, mounted on different layers of tinted card, was interlaced with tissue paper; a thick crayon outline surrounded the photograph which was embellished by her characteristic signature. The Wilding art nouveau logo was printed on the back. On 28 July 1920 Wilding married the leather merchant Walter Oscar Portham (<i>b</i>. 1867); it was a seemingly loveless marriage which ended in divorce eleven years later. On 4 June 1932, aged thirty-nine, she married the interior decorator Thomas (Rufus) Leighton Pearce (1882/3&#150;1940) who was responsible for much of the modernist and striking design in her Bond Street studio.<br>
<br>From 1923 onwards Wilding began to show her work both in Britain and abroad and became involved in commercial work including for the Condor Hat Company. She also began to supply leading periodicals with images of leading actresses&#151;defining the iconography of Tallulah Bankhead and Gladys Cooper. Wilding's portraits made her subjects beautiful, striking, and modern but also classical and sensual in a quintessential art deco style. Bright lighting, dramatic retouching, distinctive props, and her strict rules for posing, such as folding of hands and double profiles, characterized her style of iconic and idealized portraiture.<br>
<br>Prosperity was guaranteed by a series of royal sittings starting in 1928 with Prince George, later duke of Kent, and followed by the official engagement portrait of the duke and Princess Marina in 1934. These led to the official coronation portraits of George VI (1937; NPG) and Elizabeth II (1952; NPG). Her coronation portrait of Elizabeth II, made at a sitting on 15 April 1952, was the basis for the design that appeared on British definitive postage stamps between 1952 and 1967 and became known as Wildings. In 1937 Wilding opened a second studio in New York. Her Bond Street studio was bombed in the blitz in 1940, which destroyed almost all the early negatives, prints, and records. Wilding continued to work in New York, and her American subjects such as Yul Brynner (1951; NPG) and Harry Belafonte (1954; NPG) inspired some of her best later work. The duke and duchess of Windsor became regular clients.<br>
<br>Wilding's style of studio portraiture became less fashionable by the late 1950s and she exhibited her work for the last time at the London Salon of Photography in 1957. The following year her autobiography, <span class="italic">In Pursuit of Perfection</span>, was published and she sold her business for &pound;3000 to one of her assistants, Tom Hustler, who kept the studio going until 1973.<br>
<br>Wilding died on 9 February 1976 of heart failure at 1 Knaresborough Place, Kensington, London, leaving an estate of &pound;54,000 with bequests to many of her long-serving assistants. The National Portrait Gallery holds over 900 of her original negatives and prints. Her work is also represented in, among other places, the Royal Photographic Society collection at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford.<br>
