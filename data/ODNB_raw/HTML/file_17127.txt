<span class="headword">Lucas,  Frederick</span>  (1812&#150;1855), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, born in Westminster, London, on 30 March 1812, was the son of Samuel Hayhurst Lucas (<i>d</i>. in or after 1840), a corn merchant in the City of London, and a member of the Religious Society of Friends. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17139/', "Samuel Lucas (1811&#150;1865)")</script> was his elder brother. After spending eight years in a Quaker school at Darlington, he became, in his seventeenth year, a student at the London University, then recently established. He took a leading part in almost every discussion in the college debating club, or Literary and Philosophical Society. At this period the Roman Catholic claims were the principal topic of discussion, and he eagerly espoused the cause of emancipation, and devoted much attention to Irish politics. When he left the university, which had not then the power to confer degrees, he took up the study of the law, first in the chambers of Revell Phillips, and afterwards in those of Duval. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1835.<br>
<br>In 1838 Lucas delivered two lectures on education in the Literary and Scientific Institution at Staines. In these lectures, which excited some attention at the time, and were afterwards published, he bestowed his warmest sympathies on the feudal and Catholic spirit of medieval Christendom. Early in 1839, in the course of some conversations with Thomas Chisholm Anstey, he was led seriously to examine the doctrines of Roman Catholicism, and in less than a week he was reconciled to the Roman church by Father Lythgoe SJ. He forthwith published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Reasons for Becoming a Roman Catholic, Addressed to the Society of Friends</span> (1839). This offended many of his former acquaintances, but later his wife and two of his brothers followed him into the Roman communion, and he maintained an intimacy with many persons of opposite and irreconcilable views and principles. The most conspicuous of these, outside the Catholic body, were John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle. On 5 August 1840 he married Elizabeth Skidmore, daughter of William Ashby of Staines, Middlesex; they had two sons.<br>
<br>About this time Lucas wrote for the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, and acquired a literary reputation which made his co-religionists desirous that he should be permanently engaged in the support of their cause. With the aid of some wealthy Catholics he was enabled to start <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, a weekly London newspaper, the first number of which appeared on 16 May 1840. In conducting this journal he advocated the most advanced ultramontane and pro-Irish opinions with such zeal and occasional asperity of language that he soon found himself in opposition to powerful sections of his own religious community. An attempt to force his removal as editor in 1842 led him to start a rival journal, the <span class="italic">True Tablet</span>, which won the support of other English Catholics and of Daniel O'Connell and triumphed over its opponent, resuming the name of <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> in 1843. He identified himself with the Irish national movement and supported O'Connell in his demand for repeal of the Union. Towards the end of 1849 he moved the publishing offices of <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> to Dublin.<br>
<br>Lucas became an Irish political figure, leading in the foundation of the tenant-right agitation in 1850 and of the Independent Irish Party in 1851. In 1852 he was returned to parliament as one of the members for the county of Meath. He soon became a prominent debater in the House of Commons, and by his ability and evident sincerity, even when urging unpopular opinions, he gained the respect of many of his opponents. In 1853, when dissensions arose among the tenant-right party, Dr Cullen, archbishop of Dublin, and some other bishops prohibited the priests in their dioceses from interfering in political affairs. Lucas denounced in <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> this action of the archbishop, and determined to appeal from the episcopal decision to the Holy See. In the autumn of 1854 he started on a mission to Rome. He had two interviews with Pope Pius IX, at whose suggestion he began to write a full &#145;Statement&#146; of the condition of affairs in Ireland and of the questions at issue between himself and Dr Cullen.<br>
<br>In May 1855, his health having broken down, Lucas returned to England, so altered in appearance that when he presented himself at the House of Commons the doorkeepers did not know him. He stayed with friends and relatives, and finally moved to the house of his brother-in-law at Staines, where he died of heart disease on 22 October 1855. He was buried in Brompton cemetery on 27 October.<br>
<br>Lucas's &#145;Statement&#146; was not quite completed at the time of his death. This document occupies more than 300 pages in the second volume of Lucas's <span class="italic">Life</span> by his brother Edward. About six months after his death the &#145;Statement&#146; was presented to the pope. It failed to achieve its object.<br>
