<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craig,  (Edward Henry) Gordon</span>  (1872&#150;1966), <span class="occ">theatre director and designer and wood-engraver</span>, was born on 16 January 1872 in Railway Street, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the only son and second child of the architect and radical <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10889/', "Edward William Godwin (1833&#150;1886)")</script> and the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36460/', "Ellen Alice Terry (1847&#150;1928)")</script>, whose name appears on Craig's birth certificate as Eleanor Alice Godwin, formerly Watkins. His elder sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39083/', "Edith Ailsa Geraldine Craig")</script>, who later achieved prominence as a theatre director and costumier. Their parents were unmarried; indeed throughout their relationship, which began in 1868 and ended when Godwin left Terry in 1875, Ellen Terry was already married to her first husband, the artist George Frederic Watts. She had married Watts as a sixteen-year-old in 1864 and, in 1877, she was divorced from Watts and married to the actor Charles Wardell (stage name Charles Kelly). She judicially separated from Wardell in 1881.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>From an early age Craig lacked a father, had a peripatetic mother, and had a further uncertainty about his surname. Born Edward Godwin, by the age of nine he had become Edward Wardell. At sixteen, this uncertainty was resolved when he was baptized Edward Henry Gordon (the latter two names after his godparents Henry Irving and Lady Gordon). At the age of twenty-one he took the surname Craig by deed poll, after the rocky Scottish island Ailsa Craig. His schooling, too, was imprecise&#151;he attended Southfield Park preparatory school, near Tunbridge Wells, from 1883 to 1886, and after a brief interlude at Bradfield College, returned to Southfield, where the headmaster wrote of him as &#145;a good boy&#151;Flighty, but good&#146;  (E. Craig, 62). He moved on to a school in Heidelberg, but in 1888 was expelled. Craig had had walk-on parts in the theatre from the age of six, and took his first speaking role in 1885 when he went to Chicago during the Christmas holidays to join his mother in Henry Irving's production of <span class="italic">Eugene Aram</span> by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. When his schooling was over he joined Irving's company at the Lyceum Theatre.<h2>
<a name="Woodengraving"></a>Wood-engraving</h2>Until 1897, when he ceased to act, Craig took roles including Hamlet (1894) and Macbeth (1896). He was hailed as the most promising young actor in England, and his mother observed &#145;I have never known anyone with so much natural gift&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On 27 March 1893 he married an actress, Helen Mary (May) Gibson (<i>b</i>. 1872), daughter of Robert Southam Gibson, with whom, by 1897, he had had four children. During this period, in which he was briefly an actor&#150;manager (1897&#150;9), his life took a new turn when he met the artists James Pryde and William Nicholson, who introduced him to woodcutting and engraving, and the making of plain black and white illustrations. Watching Nicholson at work put Craig under a spell of pleasure, and inspired him to take up this art. He had as natural a gift for wood-engraving as he had for acting, and in 1898 he launched a new magazine, <span class="italic">The Page</span>, largely written by him, albeit under inventive pseudonyms, and aimed at the worlds of theatre and the arts. It was illustrated with his own wood-engravings.<br>
<br>Craig's earliest wood-engraving was a portrait of the poet Walt Whitman (1893), taken from a photograph. This was a revolutionary work, one of the earliest &#145;white line&#146; wood-engravings of the modern era, in which the image is made to emerge from the block, which prints black, by engraved lines which carry no ink and remain the colour of the paper. Craig embraced wood-engraving wholeheartedly, with a boyish, breathless, energy, and by the end of 1899 had engraved nearly 200 blocks. This spontaneous, affectionate approach to creativity was an aspect of his character that articulated his entire life, embracing also the tone of his writing and his theatre design.<h2>
<a name="Theatredesignanddirection"></a>Theatre design and direction</h2>The marriage with May Gibson ended in 1898 after Craig had embarked on an affair with the actress Jess Dorynne, one of many liaisons that were to decorate his life. He continued to engrave wood, but, yearning again for the stage, was encouraged by the musician Martin Shaw to embark on stage design and direction. His first production, <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> (1900) for the Purcell Society at the Hampstead Conservatoire, was revolutionary. The restrictions of the building forced Craig to design his own stage, inspired by techniques pioneered by Hubert von Herkomer at Bushey, Hertfordshire, by creating an exceptionally low proscenium to hide the backcloth frames and lighting system. The effect was &#145;strikingly panoramic&#146;  (Innes, 38), and broke radically with the tradition of stage realism with the use of colour and light pouring in from above and evoking mood and movement. Harley Granville Barker articulated Craig's intentions by describing him as &#145;a supreme master of the theatre of the clouds&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). This production was followed by Handel's <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span> (1902) at the Great Queen Street Theatre, where it was described by Granville Barker as &#145;an ever-shifting maze of colour, form, and motion&#146;  (ibid.). Haldane McFall observed to Craig that the colours in the first act were &#145;good enough to eat&#146;  (quoted E. Craig, 153).<br>
<br>By now Craig had shifted his affections once more, and was living with the 22-year-old violinist Elena Fortuna Meo (1879&#150;1957), daughter of the Hampstead painter Gaetano Meo. He designed productions for his mother at the Imperial Theatre, Tothill Street, including Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Vikings at Helgeland</span> (1903) and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (1903). These drew yet more inventive lighting, staging, and costume effects from Craig&#151;the church in <span class="italic">Much Ado</span>, act <span class="smallcap">IV</span> being evoked not so much by architecture but by diagonal streams of coloured light from an unseen stained-glass window illuminating a vast, partially obscured crucifix. The American theatre critic James Huneker wrote of <span class="italic">The Vikings at Helgeland</span>: &#145;Abolishing foot and border lights, sending shafts &hellip; from above, Mr Craig secures unexpected and bizarre effects&#146;  (J. Huneker, <span class="italic">Iconoclasts: a Book of Dramatists</span>, 1905, 32). Craig's theatre designs, which evoked the work of Edmund Dulac, Charles Ricketts, and Charles Shannon, appealed to artists rather more than to managers of the established theatre, and his productions had a high commercial failure rate. Through his inability to compromise, many projects were aborted or abandoned. Craig moved to Berlin in 1904, where he designed <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> by Otway at the Lessing Theatre (1905) and in the same year <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> by Shakespeare and Shaw's <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> for Max Reinhardt. He rarely returned to England&#151;he and May had divorced in 1905, and by that same year he had had three children with Elena.<br>
<br>In 1905 also, Craig began his affair with the dancer Isadora Duncan (1878&#150;1927), with whom he had two children. He and Duncan shared a passionate conviction for a unified theatre experience of dance, music, colour, and staging, which crossed national boundaries, under one controlling mastermind. They worked together on Craig's book <span class="italic">Isadora Duncan: Six Movement Designs</span> (1906), but in 1907 they parted, and Craig brought Elena and their children to live with him in Florence where he had settled. He designed a production of Ibsen's <span class="italic">Rosmersholm</span> (1907) which was staged at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, where it was described by the Italian designer Enrico Corradini as &#145;a new architecture of great height, ranging in colour from green to blue &hellip;; it portrayed a <i>state of mind</i>&#146;  (E. Corradini, &#145;L'arte della scena&#146;, <span class="italic">Vita d'Arte</span>, 1908). His theatrical work took him to Moscow, where, in 1912, he designed a <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> for Konstantin Stanislavsky at the Art Theatre. This was a resounding success, especially its first court scene, with &#145;Claudius and Gertrude enthroned at the back of the stage in a glittering sea of gold, and Hamlet, a lonely black-clad figure, sitting far downstage, a silhouette under a great shadow&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>In Florence, Craig started his theatre magazine <span class="italic">The Mask</span>, which ran (with a break in the First World War) from 1908 until 1929, and he founded the School for the Art of the Theatre in 1913. His highly influential book <span class="italic">On the Art of the Theatre</span>, in which he expounded his visionary ideas, was published in 1911. For part of the First World War, Craig lived in Rome, where Elena and their children joined him, and in 1917 they moved to Rapallo where Craig wrote, drew, and engraved on wood, using cut wood blocks as figures for stage models. He was now an essentially European figure. His visits to England were brief, but nevertheless in his absence he had a continuing influence over the development of wood-engraving and the theatre in his native country. He became a leading, if distant, member of the Society of Wood Engravers, and contributed to their exhibitions. He wrote on both theatre (<span class="italic">The Theatre Advancing</span>, 1921) and wood-engraving (<span class="italic">Woodcuts, and some Words</span>, 1924), and made a final essay in theatre design in the production of Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Pretenders</span> in Copenhagen (1926). For this he received the Danish order of the knights of Dannebr&oslash;g (1930). His stage designs were published by Oxford University Press in 1930, and in 1937 he was appointed a royal designer for industry by the Royal Society of Arts. Throughout his life Craig could strike an elegant pose for the camera. Articulated by well-cut features and luxuriant hair, his style of dress seemed to linger in the early nineteenth century. Craig's small, sharp eyes and curved nose gave him a bird-like appearance into old age, but his was a garden bird rather than a raptor, quizzical and busy rather than aggressive.<br>
<br>Craig moved away from stage design in the 1930s, concentrating instead on writing and wood-engraving. His edition of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, published with his wood-engravings in 1929 by Count Kessler's Cranach Press in Weimar, became a classic of private-press book production. His biography of Henry Irving appeared in 1930, and that of his mother, <span class="italic">Ellen Terry and her Secret Self</span>, the following year. &#145;Still a handsome amorist&#146;, as J. C. Trewin gently put it, Craig left Elena once again and went to Paris to live with his secretary, Daphne Woodward (1906&#150;1965), and their daughter  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). This family was interned during the Second World War, but Craig continued his work on their release. After the war Craig travelled alone and settled in Vence, France, where he completed the memoir of his early life, <span class="italic">Index to the Story of my Days, 1872&#150;1907</span>, published in 1957. Elena, who had retained a lifelong affection for him, died that same year.<br>
<br>Friends from the arts and the theatre made pilgrimages to visit Craig in his latter years. He was appointed Companion of Honour in 1958, and in 1964 he became the president of the Mermaid Theatre, London. His influence, taken up by Adolphe Appia and Max Reinhardt, passed on to younger generations of theatre directors including Tadeusz Kantor, Peter Brook, and Peter Hall. He died at Vence on 29 July 1966 after suffering two strokes. He was cremated in Marseilles on 1 August, and his ashes were buried in Elena's grave at Thame, Oxfordshire. Christopher Innes described Craig as &#145;passionate, improvident, mercurial, a self-taught genius who mastered almost everything except self-discipline and who scattered his energy among multitudinous projects; dogmatic yet secretly self-doubting, whimsical as well as visionary&#146;  (Innes, 8). Of his many children, one, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69304/', "Edward (Teddy) Craig")</script>, his biographer, became a film designer and, under the pseudonym Edward Carrick, a distinguished wood-engraver.<br>
