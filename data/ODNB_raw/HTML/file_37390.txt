<span class="headword">Egerton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fyge; <em>other married name </em>Field]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1670&#150;1723), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in London, one of the six daughters of Thomas Fyge (<i>d</i>. 1706), physician and city councilman who was descended from a landowning family of Winslow, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Mary Beacham (<i>d</i>. 1704), of Seaton, Rutland.<br>
<br>Little is known of Sarah Fyge's education; however, she was certainly precocious. She claimed to have been &#145;scarce fourteen years&#146; when she wrote <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span>, her most important work, which was published in 1686. The poem, a long verse satire, was one of many responses to Robert Gould's popular verse satire, <span class="italic">Love Given O're</span> (1682). Her father objected to her poetry and sent her to live with relatives in Shenley, Buckinghamshire, about 1687. Following this banishment she was married, apparently against her will, to an attorney named Edward Field. During this marriage they lived in or near London. Edward Field was dead by the mid-1690s. In 1700 she contributed an ode on the death of John Dryden: <span class="italic">Luctus Britannici, or, The Tears of the British Muses</span>, and she also contributed to <span class="italic">The Nine Muses</span> (1700), a volume of poems by women in memory of Dryden edited by Mary Delarivier Manley, with whom she had an intense but short-lived friendship.<br>
<br>Some time between 1700 and 1703 Sarah married the Revd Thomas Egerton (<i>d</i>. 1720), rector of Adstock, Buckinghamshire, a second cousin about twenty years her senior, and a widower. At the time of her second marriage she was in love with Henry Pierce, an attorney's clerk and associate of her first husband. By 1703 Sarah and Thomas Egerton were embroiled in an apparently unsuccessful suit for divorce. Their marriage was notoriously unhappy. Delarivier Manley records somewhat maliciously a &#145;comical Combat&#146; between the Egertons, in which Sarah throws a pie at her husband's face, and dumps butter and drink over his head while he grapples with her topknot.<br>
<br>In 1703 Egerton published, against her husband's wishes, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>. Apart from angry descriptions of the narrowness of a woman's lot, the poems also describe the poet's feelings for Pierce, whom she calls Alexis. This volume was reissued in 1706, the same year that <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> was reprinted bearing the date 1707. After this time information about Egerton is sparse. Her husband died in 1720, leaving her a childless widow in comfortable circumstances. She died in Winslow on 13 February 1723.<br>
