<span class="headword">Cooke <span class="st"> [Cook]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1807&#150;1868), <span class="occ">optician</span>, the eldest son of James Cook, a shoemaker, and his second wife, Jane, was born at Allerthorpe in the East Riding of Yorkshire on 8 March 1807. His education was limited to two years at the national school, after which he was put to his father's trade. But inspired by accounts of Captain Cook's voyages, he took up the study of mathematics and navigation, and was on the point of becoming a seaman when his mother's tears persuaded him to seek a less hazardous livelihood. Further study enabled him to open a village school, and it was here that he met Hannah Milner, a pupil, who in 1831 became his wife. He moved to York in 1829 and for the next seven years supported himself by teaching, while continuing to devote his spare moments to the study of mathematics and practical mechanics. Optics attracted him, and to make practical use of his knowledge he constructed a reflecting telescope. Since the requisite metals cost money he turned to refractors, finding cheap material in the thick bottom of a glass tumbler. He developed methods of shaping and polishing, and eventually succeeded in producing a reasonably good achromatic telescope; the instrument was later purchased by Professor John Phillips of Oxford, his lifelong friend and patron.<br>
<br>With a growing family to support, Cooke decided to embark on a full-time career as an optical instrument maker, and by March 1837 he had opened his first shop, at 50 Stonegate, York, selling refracting and reflecting telescopes, microscopes, opera glasses, spectacles, eye-glasses, optical lenses, single- and double-barrelled air-pumps, electrical machines, barometers, thermometers, spirit levels, hydrometers, globes, sundials, and mathematical instruments. His first important order was from William Gray FRS for an equatorial telescope with a lens of 4&frac12; inch diameter; this was followed in 1851 by a commission from Hugh Pattinson of Gateshead for one of a 7 inch aperture, lent in 1856 to Professor Piazzi Smyth for his expedition to Tenerife. These successes added so much to Cooke's reputation and business that in 1855 he built a new factory, known as the Buckingham Works, in Bishophill, York. It was one of the earliest scientific instrument manufactories in the country. Here Cooke made most of his own machine tools, the lens-grinding equipment was powered by steam, and metals were cast in his own foundry. He also attended exhibitions at home and abroad, often being awarded medals for the excellence of his workmanship. In 1860 he constructed an equatorial telescope for Prince Albert, later erected at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. But his largest enterprise was undertaken for Robert Stirling Newall, a manufacturer of submarine cables at Gateshead. Cooke committed himself to the onerous task of producing a huge telescope with an object-glass 25 inches across and of the highest quality in design and finish. The optical part of the commission was completed early in 1868, but Cooke, worn out by the anxieties induced by so vast an undertaking, died on 19 October 1868 at the Buckingham Works from &#145;disease of the nerves&#146;. He was buried at York cemetery. The great telescope was mounted in the following year and was completed at Newall's estate at Ferndean near Newcastle in 1871. At that time it was the world's largest refractor. It was subsequently transferred to Cambridge University observatory and later to the Greek national observatory in Athens. A pair of 5 foot transit instruments constructed by Cooke for the Indian Trigonometrical Survey was described by Lieutenant-Colonel Strange before the Royal Society in 1867. They were among the largest portable instruments of their class. Cooke also invented an excellent automatic engine for the graduation of circles, and was the first to devise machinery for engraving figures upon them. He perfected the astronomical clock, and built nearly one hundred turret clocks for public institutions and churches.<br>
<br>Cooke restored Britain to the forefront in the field of practical optics. By his methods of grinding and polishing lenses their production was rendered easy and cheap, and his object-glasses were acknowledged to be extremely fine, both in definition and colour. His construction methods brought comparatively large instruments within the reach of an extensive class of amateur astronomers. His excellent system of equatorial mounting reduced the problems of flexure, torque, and vibration. Admirable workmanship was combined, in all his instruments, with elegance of design. Simplicity, truthfulness, and modesty distinguished his private character. He was admitted a member of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1859, served on its committee in 1865&#150;6 and contributed to its proceedings a paper, &#145;On a new driving-clock for equatorials&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span>, 28, 1867&#150;8, 210&#150;13). In his will he bequeathed &#145;everything&#146; to his wife and the business was continued by two of his four sons, Thomas and Frederick.<br>
