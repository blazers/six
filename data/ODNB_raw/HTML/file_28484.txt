<span class="headword">Walker,  George Alfred</span>  (1807&#150;1884), <span class="occ">sanitary reformer</span>, was born on 27 February 1807 at Nottingham, the second son of William Walker, a plumber, and his wife, Elizabeth Williamson, of Barton under Needwood, Staffordshire; he also had at least one sister. His earliest teacher was Henry Wild, a Quaker of &#145;Notten&#146;. Later Walker moved to London and studied at Aldersgate Street School. In 1829 he became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, and, in 1831, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1835 he studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and the following year at the H&ocirc;tel Dieu in Paris. While there, he visited the great cemeteries which had been recently established outside the city boundaries, his interest in interment having first been awakened when, as a boy in Nottingham, he had witnessed shocking mutilations and upturning of human remains in the overcrowded graveyards of the town.<br>
<br>In 1837 Walker returned to London and set up in medical practice at 101 Drury Lane. Within a short distance of his surgery were seven of the most overcrowded and pestilential graveyards in London. These included the Green Ground in Portugal Street and the notorious Enon Chapel in St Clement's Lane, where between 10,000 and 12,000 people were buried under the floorboards in a cellar measuring only 59 by 29 feet. A believer in the miasmic theory of disease, Walker was convinced that the smell emanating from these overcrowded graveyards was poisonous and could ruin the health of those who lived nearby.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Gatherings from Graveyards</span> (1839) he exposed the appalling state of urban graveyards and, drawing on his extensive knowledge of health, sanitation, and mortality, sought to prove the connection between disease and burial. His solution was to propose the prohibition of intramural interment and the establishment of new cemeteries outside the towns. This was the first of a series of publications on the subject which was instrumental in securing the appointment in 1842 of the parliamentary select committee on intramural interments. It was chaired by W. A. Mackinnon (Conservative MP for Lymington, the most active campaigner in the Commons on the issue) and included Anthony Ashley Cooper, earl of Shaftesbury, who, in the following years, continued to support burial reform. Its report (1842) recommended the ending of burials in large towns, enabling parishes to establish suburban cemeteries, and the establishment of a central authority. Following this report, Sir James Graham (home secretary, 1841&#150;6), apparently as a delaying ploy, asked Edwin Chadwick (secretary of the poor-law commission, 1834&#150;46) to report on intramural interments. His report (1843) further publicized insanitary and disgusting burial areas (also exploitation, fraud, and infanticide) and recommended ending most intramural burial, and establishing a comprehensive nationalized system of interment. However, Graham's refusal to act, and the complacency of many of the medical and ecclesiastical authorities, who profited much from burial fees, prevented much immediate progress towards closing the metropolitan graveyards. Walker continued his campaign, establishing the National Society for the Abolition of Burials in Towns in 1845. He also continued to lecture and write on the subject, publishing <span class="italic">Interment and Disinterment</span> (1843), <span class="italic">Burial Ground Incendiarism</span> (1846), and <span class="italic">A Series of Lectures on the Actual Conditions of Metropolitan Graveyards</span> (1847). Some time in 1846&#150;7, Walker purchased or leased Enon Chapel, with the intention of removing the remains. At his own expense, he arranged for these to be reburied at Norwood cemetery, and 6000 people witnessed their removal in four van loads.<br>
<br>Walker's campaign was given a significant boost by the cholera epidemic of 1848, which convinced most people of a connection between disease and the state of public hygiene and sanitation. The Society for the Abolition of Burials in Towns campaigned vigorously in 1849. Among the legislation that followed were measures forbidding any further burials in London's inner-city graveyards and prohibiting interment anywhere in the metropolis if such action were necessary for the protection of public health; the bodies were subsequently removed from most of these graveyards to the large new out-of-town cemeteries, as Walker had proposed. Also, burial inspectors were appointed.<br>
<br>Walker's other principal interest was the use of warm vapour baths to treat diseases such as rheumatism, gout, and indigestion. He established the first warm vapour baths in London at 11 St James's Place in 1844, and published <span class="italic">The Warm Vapour Cure</span> (1847) to publicize his methods of treatment. However, the baths were destroyed by fire in 1854.<br>
<br>Walker retired to Ynysfaig House, Arthog, Dolgellau, Merioneth, in 1855. He spent his last years writing his memoirs, called &#145;Grave reminiscences: some experiences of a sanitary reformer&#146;, but these were never completed. Following a sudden paralytic seizure about a week before, he died, unmarried, at his home on 6 July 1884 and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground near Tywyn, Merioneth.<br>
