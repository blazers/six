<span class="headword">McCluer,  John</span>  (1759?&#150;1795), <span class="occ">hydrographer</span>, joined the Bombay marine as a volunteer about 1777. He was promoted second lieutenant on 18 February 1780 and first lieutenant on 8 January 1784. His hydrographic career probably began in March 1785 when, in the <i>Scorpion</i>, he surveyed Muscat and Matruh harbours at the entrance to the Gulf of Oman, a project which he followed by conducting a survey from Muscat to Bushehr. He continued to work in the Persian Gulf in 1786&#150;7, thus enabling Alexander Dalrymple to publish from his surveys a chart extending from the entrance to the Persian Gulf to Basrah. Later in 1787 he made the first comprehensive survey of Bombay harbour, after which he was employed for two years in the <i>Experiment</i>, his task being to conduct a detailed survey of the west coast of India; he was assisted by John Proctor in a pattamar, a locally built lateen-rigged sailing vessel.<br>
<br>Early in 1790, assisted by Lieutenant John Wedgbrough, McCluer carried out a number of surveys in Laccadive, thus completing a comprehensive survey of the west coast of India from Diu Head to Cape Cormorin. At some stage he also surveyed Mocha Road at the southern end of the Red Sea. On 23 August 1790, when by his own submission he was thirty-one years old, he was sent to the Palau Islands in the <i>Panther</i>, with the <i>Endeavour</i> (Lieutenant William Drummond) as consort, to inform the king of the death in London of his son, Prince Lee Boo. McCluer first called at several ports to embark seeds, plants, and cattle and to rate his chronometers. His course then took him through Sallawatty Strait between Sallawatty and the western end of the island of New Guinea. He reached the Palau Islands on 21 January 1791, where he broke the news to the king of his son's death. McCluer then proceeded to Macau for supplies, leaving John Proctor in the <i>Endeavour</i> (Drummond having died) to commence a survey of the Palau Islands.<br>
<br>McCluer returned to the islands and then sailed for New Guinea with the <i>Endeavour</i> to carry out a survey of the western end of the island in accordance with his instructions, during which voyage the <i>Panther</i> became the first English vessel for seventy years to call at Amboyna for supplies. Continuing his survey, he discovered an extensive inlet at the south-western end of New Guinea, which was subsequently named McCluer inlet (Teluk Berau). He then followed the south coast of New Guinea to the east as far as Cape Valsche (Ug Salah) before turning south and running a line of soundings, during December 1791 and January 1792, off the north coast of Australia, which he sighted at intervals. His soundings were later incorporated by Matthew Flinders into his small-scale chart of Australia. After calling at Timor, McCluer made for Bencoolen on the west coast of Sumatra to report his discoveries to the East India Company, one of which was that nutmeg grew near the coast of New Guinea. He returned to the Palau Islands via the island of Sulu, where he embarked grain, seeds, and cattle. On his arrival in the islands on 20 January 1793 McCluer sent Proctor in the <i>Endeavour</i> to Macau to inform the court of directors of the East India Company that he intended to remain in the Palau Islands to establish an English settlement. On 2 February he handed over the command of the <i>Panther</i> to Wedgbrough, who returned in her to Bombay.<br>
<br>After fifteen months McCluer, who was promoted captain on 27 June 1793, decided to return to the service of the East India Company. Leaving the islands in the <i>Panther</i>'s launch, which had been left behind for him, McCluer made a remarkable nineteen-day voyage to Macau. Here he bought the barque <i>Venus</i> with the intention of returning in her to Bombay after first calling at the Palau Islands to embark his native wives and family. However, before he could sail Captain John Hayes, a fellow officer in the Bombay marine, arrived in Macau from Batavia with the news that a settlement he had established in Dorey harbour in Geelvink Bay on the north coast of New Guinea was urgently in need of provisions. McCluer was persuaded to undertake its relief. He sailed from Macau on 24 July 1794 and, after calling at the Palau Islands to embark his family, he continued to New Guinea. Having relieved the settlement, McCluer sailed for Bencoolen, calling at Amboyna and Timor <i>en route</i>. From here six of his women were taken to Bombay in a Bombay frigate, while he continued to Calcutta. He sailed from the latter port in August 1795 and was never heard of again, the <i>Venus</i> having probably foundered in a storm in the Bay of Bengal. In his will, dated 12 February 1793, he made provision for &#145;a female named Elizabeth Tennel&#146; and &#145;a child named Margaret by a Malabar mother&#146;.<br>
<br>McCluer was a talented artist and drew many coastal views as aids to navigation during his career. His surveys and views were published by Dalrymple as hydrographer to the East India Company in some forty charts, plans, and sheets of coastal views. His charts of the west coast of India survived as Admiralty charts until the mid-nineteenth century. Dalrymple also published three memoirs giving details of McCluer's surveys in the Persian Gulf and of the west coast of India, while James Horsburgh published McCluer's directions for Mocha and made considerable use of his sailing directions for the west coast of India and the Laccadive Islands in his <span class="italic">India Directory</span>.<br>
