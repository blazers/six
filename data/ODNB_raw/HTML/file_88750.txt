<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Menuhin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gould]</span>,  Diana Rosamond Constance Grace Irene</span>, Lady Menuhin  (1912&#150;2003), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born on 12 November 1912 at 39 Lowndes Street, Belgravia, London, the elder daughter and second of three children of Gerard Louis Eugene Gould, a civil servant of Irish extraction, and his wife, (Daisy) Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Suart, daughter of a cavalry officer, and a gifted amateur pianist in her own right. Her father died when she was three, leaving her unworldly mother to bring up her and her siblings, Gerard and Griselda. She showed an interest in and aptitude for dance, so was sent to train with Marie Rambert at Notting Hill Gate, one of a number of pupils who enrolled, as the times of Rambert's afternoon classes fitted in after school. Although she came to loathe Rambert&#151;she suffered from criticism of her appearance and talent from both her mother and her ballet teacher that left her hurt and insecure&#151;she later generously commented that it was by far the best ballet school in England at that time. In the 1930s she found greater satisfaction from the teaching in Paris of the former ballerinas of the Russian Imperial Ballet Lubov Egorova and Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who gave her considerably more confidence.<br>
<br>Gould later called her memoir of her dance career <span class="italic">A Glimpse of Olympus</span> (1996), as she considered that she was thwarted when chosen for stardom successively by Serge Diaghilev, Anna Pavlova, and Georges Balanchine. Before she could take up Diaghilev's invitation to join the Ballets Russes he died and the same disaster occurred when Anna Pavlova invited her to join her company as a soloist. She did dance as a soloist with Georges Balanchine for his short-lived experimental Les Ballets 1933, but when he invited her to accompany him to the United States of America to found a company her cowardice won. &#145;Longing to say yes, but young and frightened at such a great leap into what might be the dark, this idiotic English virgin again said no&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glimpse of Olympus</span>, 85). L&eacute;onide Massine then asked her to join the Ballets Russes. She initially turned down the offer, but when she accepted the Russian dancers flatly refused to share allotted roles with her. Gould often said that she felt her career as a dancer had been cursed by the presence of a &#145;black fairy&#146; at her christening.<br>
<br>Gould was, nevertheless, the first home-grown ballerina of the Ballet Club and was quickly acclaimed by the ballet critic Arnold Haskell as &#145;the most musical dancer the English dance has produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glimpse of Olympus</span>, 95). She was Rambert's first star pupil, presenting a full evening recital, supported by Harold Turner, at the Maddermarket Theatre, Norwich, in 1928. Frederick Ashton, with whom Gould loved to work&#151;&#145;his instinctively musical ear, his taste, his lyrical style exactly suited my belief that dancing was the representation of music in visible form&#146;  (ibid., 69)&#151;created a number of his early ballets for her, including <span class="italic">Leda and the Swan</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Pavane pour une infante d&eacute;funte</span> (1933). She was less in sympathy with Antony Tudor's choreography but created the title role in his <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span> (1932), Thais in his <span class="italic">Paramour</span>, initially incorporated into the Oxford University Dramatic Society's <span class="italic">The Tragical Historie of Doctor Faustus</span> (1934), and the Planet in his modernistic Mars scene of <span class="italic">The Planets</span> (1934). She also performed in Max Reinhardt's <span class="italic">The Miracle</span> (1932), understudying the two leading roles; with the Markova-Dolin Ballet, for which Bronislava Nijinska cast her as the Hostess in <span class="italic">Les biches</span> (1937); and with the Arts Theatre Ballet, dancing and designing as well as serving as Harold Rubin's social secretary when he set up the Arts Theatre Club in the early years of the Second World War.<br>
<br>At 5 ft 8 ins, Gould was a tall, beautiful woman who moved well. Although she was insecure about her appearance, she became one of the first dancers to model for Fortnum and Mason's and fashion magazines, including <span class="italic">Vogue</span>. She performed as an actress both in experimental drama such as <span class="italic">Genesis 2</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Squaring the Circle</span> (1935) and in mainstream commercial productions like <span class="italic">What Every Woman Knows</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Jacobowsky and the Colonel</span> (1945), and a lively production of <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA).<br>
<br>On 19 October 1947 Gould married, as his second wife, the violinist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72100/', "Yehudi Menuhin (1916&#150;1999)")</script>, who was knighted in 1965 and created Baron Menuhin in 1993. They had two sons, and she also became stepmother to the son and daughter of her husband's first marriage. She was devoted to and fiercely protective of her husband, accompanying him throughout the world and organizing his schedule. Constantly supporting humanitarian causes, the couple mixed in rich and influential society, with homes in Gstaad, Mykonos, and London. Although she could be unforgiving and had a sharp tongue and acerbic wit, Diana Menuhin also had a gift for friendship and she was influential in the creation of Live Music Now, a programme to send young professional musicians into the community. She was an entertaining writer and speaker. She wrote two lively volumes of autobiography, first <span class="italic">Fiddler's Moll</span> (1984), describing her peripatetic partnership with Menuhin, and subsequently <span class="italic">A Glimpse of Olympus</span> (1996), concerning her performing career. Her final years were blighted by dementia, and she died in a nursing home, Meadbank, 12 Parkgate Road, Battersea, London, on 25 January 2003, of bronchopneumonia. She was survived by her two sons and her two stepchildren.<br>
