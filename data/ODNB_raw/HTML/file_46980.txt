<span class="headword">Engelbach,  Charles Richard Fox</span>  (1876&#150;1943), <span class="occ">motor engineer</span>, was born on 20 May 1876 in Kensington, London, son of Lewis William Engelbach, a clerk in the War Office, and his wife, Jessie Bryan. He left Sandringham School at Southport, Lancashire, when he was sixteen and was apprenticed at the great armaments manufacturer Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle upon Tyne. After several years of working on naval gun-turrets, in 1906 he was given the task of reviewing the faltering production of Wilson&#150;Pilcher motor cars, a sideline recently purchased by Armstrongs to provide alternative peacetime work. His lucid analysis highlighted problems common to the fledgeling motor industry in Britain, and became the basis for his career as one of the key figures in developing the industry into an effective producer.<br>
<br>Engelbach found no specialized motor department and little planning and organization devoted to Wilson&#150;Pilcher. Parts were produced in six or seven different shops, depending on what other work was available. As a result an erratic mix of components arrived at the assembly department. Of thirty-two cars, only ten had been delivered without being returned with complaints. Engelbach's plans for organized large-scale production were rejected but he was given charge of a new plant to build limited numbers of the larger 30 hp Armstrong Whitworth cars, which he did successfully.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914, Engelbach, a keen reserve naval officer, was called up, but after a year his skills were recognized and he was put in charge of the howitzer department of the Coventry ordnance works. He was made an OBE for his work. After the armistice he worked briefly for a components supplier before being called in by the team restructuring the Austin Motor Company which was in the hands of the official receiver in the post-war slump. The Austin works at Longbridge in Birmingham had grown hugely during the war but had required expensive re-engineering for peacetime production and lacked popular models.<br>
<br>Engelbach was appointed works director. On the back of the success of the Austin 7 small car, introduced in 1922, he reorganized production systematically, drawing on his experience and people from Coventry. Principal components were made and assembled in the same shop and then delivered to the appropriate position for assembly on a track. Bodies were built in series and carried on an overhead runway to a mounting shop where they met the chassis from the assembly line. It was a pattern familiar in the USA, but much less so in Britain.<br>
<br>Engelbach's reforms, spelt out in a lecture to the Institution of Automobile Engineers, whose president he became, meant that between 1922 and 1927 the number of man-weeks required to build a car fell from fifty-five to ten. Labour relations benefited from carefully worked out wage rates which increased output and earnings, and the firm later pioneered sick pay and pension schemes in line with Engelbach's belief that secure work at a good wage produced the best results.<br>
<br>The changes, though much copied, helped Austin meet the challenge of Ford's new factory, opened on a green-field site at Dagenham in 1931. But by 1938 Engelbach's eyesight had deteriorated so much that he had to be guided round the factory, and he retired. He was, nevertheless, an obvious choice for the committee which planned the government's pre-war &#145;shadow&#146; factory programme to construct ready-equipped plants for possible wartime production by existing manufacturers.<br>
<br>A sympathetic man, witty, with a range of interests, Engelbach had once turned down a professional singing career with the D'Oyly Carte company. His wife, Florence Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neumegen, whom he married on 4 October 1902, painted, exhibiting at the Royal Academy. They had two sons. He also enjoyed the conventional activities of the motor manufacturers&#151;golf and yachting&#151;and was an active freemason and office bearer in local and national employers' associations. He died on 19 February 1943 at his home, Quarry Farm, Quarry Lane, Northfield, Birmingham.<br>
