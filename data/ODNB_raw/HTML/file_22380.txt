<span class="headword">Plessis <span class="st"> [Plessy]</span>,  Joseph Octave</span>  (1762&#150;1825), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Quebec</span>, the seventh of the eighteen children of Joseph-Amable Plessy, blacksmith, and his wife, Marie-Louise Mennard, was born near Montreal on 3 March 1762. After education at the Coll&egrave;ge St Raphael, Montreal (1773&#150;8), and the Petit S&eacute;minaire, Quebec (1778&#150;80), he took minor orders and taught for three years at the Coll&egrave;ge St Raphael before being appointed secretary to the bishop of Quebec, a post he held from 1783 to 1797. He was ordained priest on 11 March 1786. In 1792 he was made cur&eacute; of Notre Dame, Quebec, the most important parish in the diocese, and in 1797 became grand vicar and coadjutor to Bishop Denault. The appointment was welcome to the government, with whom he had established good working relations, having proved his loyalty in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Consecrated coadjutor-bishop on 25 January 1801, he became bishop of Quebec in 1806, on the death of Denault. Faced with an acute shortage of priests, he gave immediate priority to education, diverting the younger clergy into secondary teaching in the hope of gaining vocations. In this task he had to overcome the opposition of the Sulpician order.<br>
<br>While remaining independent of party Plessis sought an entente with the government, and in 1812, on the outbreak of war with the United States, he won its goodwill by his efforts to secure French-Canadian loyalty. In 1814 he was granted a salary of 1000 louis, a seat in the legislative council, and legal recognition of his office. On becoming archbishop of Quebec in 1819 he travelled to Rome in the hope of securing the elevation of his vast diocese into a metropolitan province. Though this request was not granted, vicars-general were appointed for Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Upper Canada. His pastoral visitations extended to the remotest areas and he was notably supportive of their isolated clergy.<br>
<br>Plessis's relations with the civil authorities were less cordial under the governorship of Lord Dalhousie. In 1822 he opposed the union of Lower with Upper Canada because it included a clause making clerical appointments subject to government approval, and he was uncompromising in his insistence on a separate Catholic school system. He died at Quebec on 4 December 1825 and was buried in the cathedral of Notre-Dame on 7 December. His vigorous policy of administrative, pastoral, and educational reform left the Canadian church with a new sense of purpose and enhanced prestige.<br>
