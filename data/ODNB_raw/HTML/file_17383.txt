<span class="headword">MacCarthy Reagh,  Florence</span> <span class="st"> [Finian Mac C&aacute;rthaigh Riabhach]</span>  (1562&#150;<em>c.</em>1640), <span class="occ">chieftain and writer on Ireland</span>, was probably born at Kilbrittan Castle, the eldest son of Sir Donough MacCarthy Reagh (<i>d</i>. 1576), the second of the MacCarthy chiefs, the others being the MacCarthy of Muskerry and the MacCarthy More, the greatest. His mother was a daughter of James FitzMaurice of Desmond and the aunt of the last earl of Desmond. His father, who was lord of Carberry in west Cork, and a loyal subject of the crown, taught his son the arts of Gaelic politics and dissimulation, in which he would so excel. MacCarthy began his career by exacting tribute from and laying other impositions upon his father's dependants, which attracted the attention of the local authorities. Upon Sir Donough's death, the chieftainship passed to his younger brother, Sir Owen (Eoghan) MacCarthy. Finian was made a ward of the president of Munster, Sir William Drury, and was left with twenty-seven ploughlands worth &pound;1500 a year by his father. He became of age about 1578, when he entered the royal army with 300 of his own men and gained a reputation as a good fighting man on the side of the crown in the Desmond rebellion in Munster. <br>
<br>After the suppression of the rebellion in 1583, MacCarthy went to London, where Elizabeth I received him and awarded him &pound;1000 for his services and gave him an annual pension of &pound;100. He spent some considerable time at the court over the next five years, took up the fashions of the typical English courtier, learned to speak good English, and Anglicized his forename to Florence. He returned to Ireland and was present in 1585 at the opening of the Irish parliament in Dublin held by Sir John Perrott. Throughout his life he played a double game both as an English gentleman and as a Gaelic lord, and was in consequence increasingly distrusted by both sides. He remained a Catholic after he became of age, but refused to sue for livery of his estates, which would have necessitated his taking the oath of supremacy. He developed a liking for Spanish culture and learned to speak Spanish, having several relatives at the Spanish court at Madrid. He was described in one dispatch as being &#145;more Spanish than English&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1596&#150;7</i>, 232). It subsequently transpired that he had had connections with Sir William Stanley, who in 1586 had betrayed the English garrison at Deventer to the Spanish. <br>
<br>Florence stood second in succession to the title of MacCarthy Reagh behind his uncle Sir Owen and his cousin Donal-na-pipi. He stood opposed to Donal's claims to the clan title, in virtue of a patent given the latter by his father some years before. In 1583&#150;4 the clan MacCarthy Reagh made Donal swear that he would not divert the succession from Florence, on payment of a bond of &pound;10,000. Florence also had aspirations of becoming the MacCarthy More, and to that end in 1588 he eloped with and married the sole heir, Ellen (also known as Eileen), daughter of Donal McCarthy, first earl of Clancare, the current MacCarthy More. It had already been arranged that she should marry Nicholas, son of Sir Valentine Browne, an undertaker (planter) in co. Kerry of English birth, who held lands by mortgage from the earl. The prospect of one man with well-known Spanish sympathies holding the titles of both MacCarthy Reagh and MacCarthy More caused consternation among the authorities. Florence and his wife were taken prisoner. He was put in Cork gaol for six months and on 10 February 1589 sent to the Tower of London. Clancare promised to persuade his daughter to divorce Florence, who, to forestall this, had her removed from imprisonment in Cork on 18 February. He was questioned by the privy council on 23 March in relation to his Spanish connections, which he denied. He remained in the Tower until his marriage to Ellen was finally accepted by the authorities and she was permitted to come out of hiding and visit her husband in London. He was released from the Tower on 19 January 1591 on condition that he remain in London. The earl of Ormond later stood surety for Florence, and he was permitted to return to Ireland in November 1593. <br>
<br>In his absence Florence's properties in Munster had fallen prey to the depredations of local magnates and settlers, and he incurred huge legal expenses in prosecuting suits against Lord Barry, whom he blamed for being the author of his misfortunes. The earl of Clancare died in 1596 and Florence's claims to his lands were regarded sympathetically by the authorities, who considered him a useful pawn in a situation of growing unrest among the northern Gaelic chieftains. In 1598 Clancare's illegitimate son, Donal, had proclaimed himself the MacCarthy More and offered his support to Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, in his rebellion against the crown. But Florence's brother-in-law, the O'Sullivan More, refused to inaugurate Donal as MacCarthy More, and thereby negated his claim to it. On 16 March 1598 the English privy council ruled that Florence and not Valentine Browne should inherit Clancare's lands. <br>
<br>Florence finally returned to Munster in 1599, to claim the title of MacCarthy More. He hired 500 Connaught mercenaries or bonaghs, sealed off the entrances to his country, defeated Donal, and was inaugurated on 1 January 1600 as the MacCarthy More. In February the earl of Tyrone marched into Munster and called all the lords of the province to a parley. Florence's useful Spanish connections swayed Tyrone into accepting him as an ally. Tyrone therefore banished Donal and reinstalled Florence as the MacCarthy More and gave him 600 mercenaries. Florence promptly wrote to the English authorities informing them of his loyalty to the queen. In April the Munster commissioners under Captain Flower sent a force of 1000 to despoil the MacCarthy country. Florence laid an ambush for them as they were returning between Kinsale and Cork on 21 April. The ensuing battle, in which the Irish forces were eventually defeated after forcing an initial retreat by the English, was the one and only time that Florence actually encountered royal troops in the field. Upon Sir George Carew's arrival in Ireland as treasurer at war and subsequently lord justice and president of Munster, he invited a nervous Florence to a meeting on 29 October on a promise of safe conduct, at which he assured Carew of his neutrality and promised to send his eldest son to Cork as a pledge if the queen would grant him the Desmond estates and confirm his title of MacCarthy More. It is likely that Florence spent the next several months making arrangements with the Spanish for a landing in Munster, while at the same time protesting his loyalty to both the English authorities and the Irish rebels, especially Tyrone. It is most likely that his behaviour was inspired by the fear of being sent back to the Tower. <br>
<br>After the capture in late May 1601 of the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> (&#145;straw&#146;) or pretender earl of Desmond, James FitzThomas, who had been appointed by Tyrone, Carew felt himself to be in a position to take matters finally into his control. He arrested Florence, even though he still remained under the protection of the great seal, and was sent under a spurious pretext to the Tower; here and at the Marshalsea, with two periods of liberty within England, he spent the rest of his long life. He was never tried with any offence and continued to try to regain his escheated lands. But he was apparently treated with some leniency and given special privileges, including access to his books, which enabled him to compose &#145;A treatise on the antiquity and history of Ireland&#146;, a history of Ireland from mythical times to the Norman conquest, a work of some scholarship. He died in London about 1640. His schemings and dealings with both English and Irish left him with an unedifying reputation among his contemporaries as a vain, ambitious, and foolish man, who tried to please both sides and pleased neither. The eldest of his four sons, Tadhg, died as a boy in the Tower, so he was succeeded as the MacCarthy More by his second son, Donal, who married Sarah, the daughter of Randal MacDonnell, earl of Antrim. Their relationship had long since become estranged: she had held Castle Lough in Desmond with her own supporters against him and was to receive a government pension for informing on her husband to Carew.<br>
