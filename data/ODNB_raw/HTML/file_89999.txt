<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roberts,  John Morris</span>  (1928&#150;2003), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 14 April 1928 at 35 Longfellow Avenue, Bath, the only child of Edward Henry Roberts, ironmonger, and his wife, Dorothy Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hallett. Educated at Taunton School, he went to Keble College, Oxford, with a scholarship. He graduated in 1948 with a first in modern history followed by national service in the intelligence corps. In 1951 he was elected to a prize fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford. His career as an academic historian began with a doctoral thesis (1953) on the Cisalpine republic in northern Italy under the tutelage of the French directory and then Napoleon. In 1953 he was elected to a tutorial fellowship at Merton College, Oxford, but deferred this for a year which he spent at Princeton and Yale. On 10 September 1960, at Milton Abbas, he married (Mariabella) Rosalind Gardiner, daughter of Henry Rolf Gardiner, a farmer. This marriage was dissolved in 1964 and in Oxford on 29 August the same year he married Judith Cecilia Mary Armitage, schoolteacher, and daughter of James Armitage, a clerk in holy orders. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Roberts was a college tutor (1954&#150;79) at a time when the tutorial system in Oxford was at its apogee as a form of individualized education delivered to a characteristic mix of exceptionally brilliant and much less able students. He exemplified the system at its best: attentive, kind, and stimulating to all but the idle, who were imperiously dismissed. He forced his pupils to think for themselves by asking unnerving questions, by subverting apparent self-evidence, and by producing information or parallels new to the student. His success lay in his understanding of individual students and his ability to adjust his teaching and provocative questions to their individual potential. Fluent in several western European languages, he had also acquired familiarity with American history at Yale. These were uncommon attributes among Oxford historians at the time. He was thus brought to teach a very broad range of history, underpinning what later became his personal historical style. He read a lot of history in European languages other than English. As a result his thinking and teaching focused on large questions.<br>
<br>Roberts believed strongly in the importance of primary research and this was evidenced by his editorship (with Richard Cobb and subsequently John Hardman) of the two-volume <span class="italic">French Revolution Documents</span> (1966)&#151;a remarkably shrewd and extensive selection of primary sources for study by undergraduates. He published two monographs, <span class="italic">The Mythology of Secret Societies</span> (1972) and <span class="italic">The Paris Commune from the Right</span> (1974), which demonstrated his characteristic concern with viewing things from an unexpected angle. His attention to formal scholarship was also visible in his meticulous and competent editorship of the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> between 1967 and 1977. However, it is evident that he was always more at ease on a broader canvas. His capacity for crystal-clear and incisive generalization based on mastery of the main lines of the history of different countries and the points of convergence between them was first demonstrated in his <span class="italic">Europe 1880&#150;1945</span> (1967). Such a textbook was in many ways the extension of his talents as a college tutor and in his hands the increasingly panoptical approach was to become very illuminating, as he explored it in books such as his <span class="italic">History of the World</span> (1976).<br>
<br>This desire to seize the broad sweep of history and to explain it to an audience of non-initiates&#151;to educate them about history and its importance in the understanding of their contemporary present&#151;found its most successful expression in Roberts's television series of 1985, <span class="italic">The Triumph of the West</span>. Few historians have excelled in this difficult medium. Roberts excelled because he had a strong theme (the spread of the innovations fostered by a self-transforming Western culture) presented without prejudice or triumphalism, and in the same spirit of thought-provoking interest that pervaded his tutorial style. He did not bow to editorial judgements based only on televisual concerns (at the cost, indeed, of some robust encounters behind the scenes) and as a result never looked ridiculous or superficial. The programme attracted two million viewers, was repeated in 1988, and was seen in a substantial number of other countries. The success was justified because he did indeed articulate a way of looking at history and the world that was quite new and enlightening to his audience.<br>
<br>By the time of <span class="italic">The Triumph of the West</span>, Roberts's talents as an organizer and a man of sound judgement had brought him the opportunity of another career. Indeed in Oxford he had increasingly taken on roles of either administration or collective academic effort. He had been acting warden of Merton in 1969&#150;70 and again in 1977&#150;9. He was senior proctor in 1967&#150;8 at a time when student troubles affected many universities but left Oxford untouched for the time being, which many attributed in part to his stewardship of this office with its particular function of supervision of the administrative bodies of the university and of student affairs. As for the work of historians, as well as editing the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, he became general editor of Purnell's <span class="italic">History of the Twentieth Century</span>, of the <span class="italic">New Oxford History of England</span>, and of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of Europe</span>.<br>
<br>In 1979 Roberts accepted the position of vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton. His tenure (1979&#150;85) coincided with a new and more abrasive government policy towards universities. In his words, universities then still believed &#145;that they could prosper without national planning (let alone collective action) or the consideration of anything other than piecemeal expansion in terms of more of the same&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 100). There was little sense that money might not continue to be supplied as before. In many ways Southampton was typical of the dilemmas facing universities. It had grown markedly in recent years so that the strong sense of institutional solidarity among its members no longer matched the reality of an institution now too big for business to be conducted by people who all knew each other. It faced sudden demands for serious financial cuts without the academic culture necessary to accept easily differentiation between colleagues and departments. Roberts brought energy and decisiveness to the resolution of these difficulties. His early proposals, which reflected his view of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the university, provoked considerable opposition (especially over staff reductions) and the suspicions about him generated by this in some parts of the institution never really died away during the rest of his time there. Certainly he drove change from the top. None the less he did set out to persuade colleagues of the need for change and convinced a great many. He pioneered at Southampton innovations which later became standard practice in all British universities. He emphasized diversification and growth of earnings; inaugurated fund-raising; gave impetus to an alumni organization; invested in public relations; worked hard with the local community; instituted internal reviews of departments, restructured departments, bid for government funding for new centres, and favoured new degree courses; invested in new buildings and actively sought out high-quality academics for new chairs; and initiated a science park. He was a modernizer who left Southampton much stronger than he found it.<br>
<br>In 1985 Roberts returned to Oxford as warden of Merton College, where he stayed until retirement in 1994. He later wrote that it was a decision &#145;too much swayed by powerful feelings&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 109), and it certainly reflected the strong emotional bond he felt. He set himself with energy to modernize the college. He oversaw an ambitious programme of refurbishment and new building. He initiated a large appeal which innovated in Oxford at that time by its emphasis on building the alumni association and on the permanence of the engagement of the college with its alumni. Given the classic individualism of a college community, it was Roberts who provided not only the impetus for all these initiatives but also did most of the hard work. He travelled tirelessly on the college's behalf while stimulating a strong culture of intellectual endeavour in it. At the same time, he was convinced that the future of Oxford depended on making a large place for postgraduate students. He pursued this direction in the college by expanding the number of graduate students and by providing proper facilities for them. He pursued it too with the university, chairing an inquiry into provision for postgraduates which in 1987 resulted in a powerful report. None the less, it is hard not to think that, after Southampton, Merton was too limited a stage for Roberts. The projects he pursued there were essentially extensions of his work at Southampton but on a smaller scale. He found Merton and Oxford coming to terms with the new pressures on universities in the same way that he had seen in Southampton and with the same divisions and doubts, but the complexity of the Oxford structure made impossible a clear decision-making role such as he had become used to.<br>
<br>Among other activities Roberts was a trustee of the Rhodes Trust (1988&#150;94) and of the National Portrait Gallery (1984&#150;98); a member of the board of the British Council (1991&#150;8); and a governor of the BBC (1988&#150;93). He was made a CBE in 1996. To all his different activities he brought a considerable breadth of vision, facilitated by a strong and quick intelligence. He had directness of mind and purpose together with decisive and sound judgement of people. He was capable of great personal warmth and loyalty in friendship as well as frosty dismissiveness of those he saw as fools. All his endeavours were pursued with boundless energy, although at times of frustration in matters substantial or ephemeral this could translate into what appeared to be brusqueness. After retirement Roberts lived in Somerset, where he had long kept a base. He died at his home, Timwood Farm, Roadwater, near Watchet, on 30 May 2003 after a protracted struggle with myeloma. He was buried in the cemetery of nearby Leighland church. He was survived by his wife, Judith, and their three children.<br>
