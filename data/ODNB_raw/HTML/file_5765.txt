</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cockburn, Sir  Alexander James Edmund</span>, twelfth baronet  (1802&#150;1880), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 24 December 1802, the only son of Alexander Cockburn (1776&#150;1852), later envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Wurtemburg and then Colombia, and his wife, Yolande (<i>d</i>. 1810), daughter of the vicomte de Vignier of St Domingo. Part of his early education took place on the continent, leaving him fluent in French, and with some knowledge of Spanish, German, and Italian. In September 1822 he was admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a scholar and prizeman in 1823, and president of the Union Society in 1824. He achieved first class in civil law in 1824&#150;5, and graduated LLB in 1829, and would remain a fellow of his college until 1850. In November 1825 Cockburn was admitted into the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in February 1829. After his call Cockburn joined the western circuit. He acquired a large practice at the Devon sessions, but was so doubtful of success in London that he did not even keep his chambers open. He had an adventurous youth, observing in later years, &#145;Whatever happens, I have had my whack&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Generation of Judges by their Reporter</span>, 10). On one occasion, he had to escape from bailiffs by climbing out the window of the robing rooms at Exeter Castle. Ever keen on the company of women, he fathered two illegitimate children, a girl and a boy, Alexander Dalton Cockburn, to whom he left the majority of his fortune.<h2>
<a name="Earlypracticeatthebarandinpolitics"></a>Early practice at the bar and in politics</h2>After the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832, Cockburn began to practise in election cases and published a set of election reports with William Rowe. He was retained as counsel by the MPs for Coventry, Henry Lytton Bulwer and Edward Ellice. It was thanks to the latter that he was appointed in 1834 to the municipal corporations commission, being assigned to the north midland circuit. Some of his reports, written jointly with his fellow commissioners Whitcombe and Rushton, were of high quality; but those he undertook alone were less ample in their detail, and appeared to have had less care bestowed on them. His election business introduced him to Joseph Parkes, the Liberal agent, and he would soon cultivate an interest in politics.<br>
<br>Cockburn's election and parliamentary practice was lucrative; but he was also very ambitious. In 1838 he turned down an Indian puisne judgeship worth &pound;2000 a year, saying &#145;I am going in for something better than that&#146;  (Manson, 158). He soon began to reduce his election and parliamentary practice, to concentrate on higher profile cases, and in 1838 became recorder of Southampton. In 1841, the year in which he took silk, he argued successfully for his uncle Sir William Cockburn (1773&#150;1858), the dean of York, in a proceeding against the archbishop of York for illegally depriving the dean on a charge of simony, which had been brought before Dr Phillimore. Two years later, he attracted much wider notice by his successful defence of McNaughten, who was acquitted of the murder of Peel's secretary, Edward Drummond, on the grounds of insanity. In a long and much publicized speech, Cockburn persuaded the jury to accept the view of the experts that the defendant could not tell right from wrong.<br>
<br>Cockburn's taste for high-profile cases continued. In 1844 he appeared for the owners in the celebrated case concerning the racehorse Running Rein. In 1852 he defended John Henry Newman in the libel action brought against him by Achilli, where his opponent was (as it would be in many cases at this time) Sir Frederick Thesiger. In the same year, he was engaged in the Hopwood will case, in which the court of chancery referred to a Liverpool jury the question whether an elderly testator, with a fortune of &pound;7000 a year, had been of sound mind when disinheriting his eldest son just prior to his death. Cockburn persuaded the jury that he had not. In 1856 he prosecuted William Palmer, a medical man with high gambling debts, in a case where all hinged on circumstantial evidence. Cockburn prepared by studying the effects of poisons day and night, and his mastery of the detail was so thorough that Palmer, who became known as the Rugeley poisoner, attributed his conviction to Cockburn's skill with a racing metaphor: &#145;It's the riding that has done it&#146;  (Yates, 2.131).<br>
<br>In 1847 Cockburn was elected Liberal member of parliament for Southampton. At first he spoke little, save on legal matters. However, in 1850 Palmerston required a cool, legalistic defence of his conduct of the Don Pacifico affair. After Crowder had turned down an invitation to supply this, Cockburn rose to the occasion, delivering the best speech of his life, and in effect saving the government from defeat. This performance secured for Cockburn the post of solicitor-general, which was accompanied in August 1850 by a knighthood. In March 1851 he was promoted to the attorney-generalship, which he retained until the fall of the government one year later. He was reappointed to the post at the beginning of 1853, and became recorder of Bristol in the following year. He was an active member of the government and not slow to assert himself politically: thus, in July 1855, he was one of the main leaders of the group of Liberal MPs who forced Russell to quit the government. However, he was cautious on law reform, as his opposition to J. G. Phillimore's bill in 1855 for a public prosecutor showed.<h2>
<a name="Onthebench"></a>On the bench</h2>With the death of the chief justice of the common pleas, Sir John Jervis, in 1856, Cockburn, as attorney-general, was the obvious successor. However, he hesitated before accepting the post, for it entailed giving up an income at the bar of some &pound;15,000 a year for a salary of &pound;6000, as well as giving up his parliamentary career. At the same time, he did not relish the civil cases which filled the common pleas, not least because he was not a particularly distinguished technical lawyer. Three years later, on Palmerston's return to office, he was made chief justice of the queen's bench. He had in fact hoped to become lord chancellor, but Campbell was preferred. It would not be the only occasion when he would be disappointed at being overlooked for the great seal. On his promotion to the queen's bench, Palmerston offered him a peerage, but Cockburn turned it down, not desiring to hold a peerage as chief justice. The prime minister then promised him that he could have the peerage whenever he wanted it. In 1864 Cockburn asked for the promise to be made good; but the royal household informed the government that &#145;this peerage has been more than once previously refused upon the ground of the notoriously bad moral character of the Chief Justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1.257). Given the queen's sincere disapproval, Cockburn did not press the matter. He had succeeded to the baronetcy held by his uncle in April 1858.<br>
<br>On the bench as at the bar Cockburn relished the limelight offered by controversial cases. In April 1867 he delivered a six-hour charge to a grand jury at the Old Bailey in the case of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand, who had been charged with the murder of George William Gordon, executed under the martial law declared in Jamaica by Governor Eyre. Eyre regarded Cockburn's charge as &#145;violent and partisan&#146;, and claimed that the chief justice &#145;would do all in his power and beyond it to further the ends of the Jamaica Committee&#146;  (Heuston, 17). In a carefully reasoned address, Cockburn told the grand jury that the common law knew of no such thing as martial law. Though life might be protected and crime prevented by the immediate application of such force as was necessary under the circumstances, the crown had no power to go further, as Eyre had done. He declared that the seizure of Gordon had been illegal, and that his trial had been marred by improper proceedings. It was indeed an invitation to the grand jury to find the indictment; but in the heated atmosphere of the time, they found no true bill. Cockburn's charge, while lauded in the press for its liberal principles, had potentially disturbing implications for a government facing increasing Fenian hostilities in Ireland; and his views were attacked both by Eyre's supporters in the Lords and by Thomas Carlyle. Moreover, when in June 1868 Eyre himself faced a grand jury, Justice Blackburn took an entirely different view of the law, directing the jury to throw the bill out. Blackburn's assertion that all the judges&#151;including the chief justice&#151;agreed with him earned him a sharp rebuke in court from Cockburn.<br>
<br>Cockburn continued to choose to sit in controversial cases, for, as Bramwell put it, it was his great desire to have a page of <span class="italic">The Times</span> devoted to him every day. He presided over the case of <i>Saurin v. Starr</i> in 1869, when a sister of mercy expelled from her order sued for damages. Coleridge, who appeared in the case, commented that &#145;Cockburn enjoys the situation and goes on making things longer and longer&#146;  (Coleridge, 2.163). He also presided over the trial of the directors of the failed bank of Overend, Gurney &amp; Co. The most controversial trial he handled, however, was the perjury case in 1874 of Arthur Orton, the Tichborne claimant, which followed the collapse of the civil suit where the claims were asserted. From the outset, the defence felt that the chief justice was biased against them&#151;he had, after all, during the civil case, congratulated Coleridge for turning the tide of opinion against the &#145;monster&#146;, by accusing him of being a perjurer and a slanderer. The criminal trial proved long drawn out and difficult, thanks to the confrontational attitude of Orton's lawyer, Dr Edward Vaughan Kenealy, who ferociously attacked the character of many of the witnesses, and even appeared to cast aspersions on the bench. Though he was godfather to one of Kenealy's children, Cockburn was provoked by the barrister into making &#145;utterances to which a colder and less generous disposition would not have been tempted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span>, 18, 1874, 337). After many skirmishes during the trial, Cockburn exacted his revenge on Kenealy in his summing-up, which lasted 18 days, and filled 800 pages in 2 volumes. He began by accusing Kenealy of mis-stating evidence, perverting facts, and attempting to make foul imputations against innocent people, and of abusing the liberty of the bar. Cockburn was playing to the crowd, and his speech was met with suppressed applause. His summing-up ended with a declaration that the jury's verdict would be received as sincere by all, except &#145;fanatics and fools&#146;&#151;a phrase seized on by the claimant's supporters in the popular press  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 March 1874, 8).<br>
<br>Cockburn's handling of this case showed up some of his faults as a judge. It was generally agreed that his desire to play to the gallery had prolonged the case, and contributed to its highly charged atmosphere. Many in the profession regretted the overt antagonism shown towards the defence by the judge, and it was felt that too often he had over-ridden rather than over-ruled legal objections. It was not the only case in which it would be observed that Cockburn's &#145;cursed vanity led him into fireworks for ten minutes, which, to my thinking, spoiled the whole&#146;  (Coleridge, 2.167). Nevertheless, when Kenealy in 1874 sought a royal commission to look into the handling of this case, Cockburn's parliamentary friends rallied around him, Disraeli praising him as a &#145;man of transcendent abilities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 223, 1874, 1598).<h2>
<a name="Legalandpoliticalcontroversies"></a>Legal and political controversies</h2>In his later years, Cockburn never shied from entering into public controversies on legal matters. Although he professed to desire law reform, his attitude in practice was generally conservative and cautious. In 1870, for instance, he attacked the <span class="roman">High Court of Justice Bill</span>, which sought to effect a fusion of the courts of law and equity. While claiming to support the principle, he got the common-law judges to agree to a resolution that &#145;express provision shall be made as to what the law shall be in each particular instance&#146;&#151;a requirement which would have made fusion impossible. Equally damaging was the opposition of the judges to the government's proposal that the rules of the new court should be left to a committee of unnamed members to work out. The opposition organized by Cockburn&#151;encapsulated in his letter to the Lord Chancellor Hatherley, entitled &#145;Our judicial system&#146;&#151;effectively delayed the reforms for three years. Cockburn abhorred any idea that the style and title of chief justice might be compromised by the reforms, and remained in office to become the first man to hold the legally recognized title of Lord Chief Justice of England.<br>
<br>In 1871 Cockburn clashed once more with Hatherley, over the appointment of Sir Robert Collier to the judicial committee of the privy council. To help reduce arrears in privy council cases, an act had been passed in 1871 to appoint four salaried members of the privy council, from men who had either been chief justices in India or superior court judges in England. However, since the salary was only &pound;5000 a year, and since the judges would have to pay their own clerks, the government found great difficulty in filling the second common-law judgeship. After three had declined, and after Cockburn had let it be known that no judge would accept, Gladstone decided to offer it to the attorney-general. Collier was duly appointed to the common pleas for two weeks, in order to qualify under the statute for office on the judicial committee. Cockburn was furious, writing to Gladstone that such &#145;a colourable appointment to a judgeship for the purpose of evading the law appears to me most seriously to compromise the dignity of the judicial office&#146;. The chief justice raised the stakes by publishing the letter in <span class="italic">The Times</span>  (5 Dec 1871). He was especially irritated by the fact that he had only received a curt reply from Gladstone and an uncivil one from Hatherley. In turn, the lord chancellor, a man with a keen sense of decorum, felt mortified by an imputation of corruption coming from a man with Cockburn's reputation, and thought it inappropriate for the chief justice to launch a public attack without first being in full possession of the facts. He was also determined not to be accountable on a political matter to the chief justice, and to wait until the meeting of parliament to explain his actions. When the Lords met in February 1872, Cockburn ensured that his friends would attack Hatherley. However, the government fought back and, incensed by the attack on his conduct by the eighth duke of Argyll, the chief justice threatened to break all links with the government if he did not receive an apology.<br>
<br>In particular, Cockburn threatened to resign from his position as Britain's representative at the Geneva arbitration to settle the United States' claims arising from alleged breaches of neutrality during the American Civil War. The question of compensation had been referred to five arbitrators by the treaty of Washington of 1871, a treaty which Cockburn felt had been ineptly negotiated and badly drafted. He also formed a low opinion of the competence of the other arbitrators, and allowed his irritation to show through, even to the length of insulting them. His view was that they had determined to decide against Great Britain without first listening to the arguments, and without having a sufficiently detailed grasp of the principles of international law. In the end, &pound;3.2 million damages was awarded against Great Britain, with Cockburn recording an elaborate dissent from the report in September 1872. While he admitted Britain's liability for the depredations of the ship the <i>Alabama</i> he dissented on the other matters. A peerage was once again made available to Cockburn at this stage. However, he again refused it, in part from his growing dislike of Gladstone, and in part because he did not want to resign as chief justice, and did not want a peerage while he held that office. Instead, in February 1873, he was awarded the grand cross of the Bath.<br>
<br>Cockburn's legal conservatism was seen again in 1874 and 1878 over proposals to codify criminal law. In 1874 he attacked a bill drawn by James Fitzjames Stephen to codify the law of homicide as partial and imperfect, with the result that the bill was withdrawn. Four years later, he sabotaged the codification bill of the criminal law commissioners by writing a letter to the attorney-general in protest. Cockburn took the view that codification was desirable, but that any partial measure which relied at all on common-law principles would merely create confusion. Stephen was furious, suspecting that Cockburn's hostility to the measure was connected to his resentment at having been omitted from the commission, and replied to his critic with an article in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>.<br>
<br>In 1878 Cockburn issued another sharp letter to a judge, this time answering Lord Penzance's comments in <i>Combe v. Edwards</i>, which criticized Cockburn for issuing a writ of prohibition against his proceedings as an ecclesiastical judge in <i>Martin v. Mackonochie</i>. Though in form a private letter, it was once more an attempt at a public vindication of his own conduct, and was described by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;a singularly unedifying controversy&#146;  (22 Nov 1880).<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeandreputation"></a>Later life and reputation</h2>As a judge, Cockburn did not have the highest reputation. The quip in the legal profession was that he became a first-rate judge, but only by sitting alongside Justice Blackburn. For Selborne, he was &#145;splendid rather than learned or profound&#146;  (Palmer, 1.496), while Coleridge simply said &#145;I do <i>not</i> feel oppressed at having to succeed <i>him</i>&#146;  (2.300). He was not remembered as a deductive legal logician, but rather as a man of the world who knew how to master detail by hard work and present a rounded picture to the jury.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Cockburn made a number of important judgments, notably in aspects of public law. In <i>R. v. Lords Commissioners of the Treasury</i> (1872), he ruled that the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> did not lie against the crown to compel those who held money as agents for the crown to hand it over to those legally entitled to it; and in <i>Rustomjee v. R.</i> (1876) he held that a petition of right could not be used to compel the crown to pay compensation acquired under a treaty to those who had suffered the damage to be compensated. In a leading case on the notion of fair comment in libel, <i>Campbell v. Spottiswoode</i> (1863), he ruled that it was actionable to say that the editor of a religious magazine who advocated a scheme for missions to the heathen was an impostor, and that his aim was merely a pretext for puffing his magazine, even if the libeller thought it was true. For Cockburn, the law should not sanction attacks on people's honour and character made without any foundation. However, in <i>Wason v. Walter</i> (1868), he ruled that fair reports of parliamentary proceedings should not be subjected to the law of libel, even if parts were defamatory. He was keen for the common law to continue to develop with society, and in cases like <i>Goodwin v. Robarts</i> (1875) sought to ensure that commercial law kept pace with commercial practice.<br>
<br>A short man, with a large head and an expansive brow, Cockburn had a warm charm, a distinguished air, and a melodious voice. He was highly courteous, witty and eloquent in company, and keen to share anecdotes with his friends, who included Charles Dickens. An enthusiastic follower of music, he generally entertained the prima donnas of the age, and hosted musical evenings for his friends, always retiring late, and rising only in time to rush to court. Cockburn was also a keen sailor, and enjoyed hunting, though more for the company than the shooting. He was the author of a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Nationality, or, The Law Relating to Subjects and Aliens</span> (1869), which discussed the report of the Naturalization Commission of 1868. At the time of his death, he had prepared a work on the authorship of Junius, and was writing a series of articles entitled &#145;The history of the chase&#146; in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>. An honorary fellow of his college, he was disappointed not to have been elected master of Trinity Hall in 1877, on the death of Dr Geldart. He was, however, chairman of the Cambridge University commission in 1877 and 1878. He continued to devote himself to his work, in spite of three heart attacks and repeated warnings from his doctors, and died suddenly at his home at 40 Hertford Street in Mayfair on 20 November 1880; he was buried six days later at Kensal Green.<br>
