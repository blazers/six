<span class="headword">FitzRoy <span class="st"> [Fitzroy, Fitz-Roy]</span>,  Robert</span>  (1805&#150;1865), <span class="occ">hydrographer and meteorologist</span>, was the second son of the second marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9631/', "Lord Charles FitzRoy (1764&#150;1829)")</script>, son of Augustus Henry, third duke of Grafton, to Lady Frances Anne Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1810), eldest daughter of the first marquess of Londonderry. He was born at Ampton Hall, Suffolk, on 5 July 1805. In 1809 the family moved to Wicken, Northamptonshire, where his mother died the following year. He attended school at Rottingdean and at Harrow (1817&#150;18), and then, aged thirteen, went to the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, where he proved an exemplary student and was the first winner, in 1819, of the mathematical prize.<br>
<br>FitzRoy joined the <i>Owen Glendower</i> as volunteer, later midshipman, on the South American station, transferring in 1822 to the <i>Hind</i> and the <i>Cambrian</i> in the Mediterranean, and in 1824 to the <i>Seringapatam</i> on the channel station. In his lieutenant's examination he came first out of the twenty-seven candidates and was promoted to that rank on 7 September 1824. He returned to South America with the <i>Thetis</i>, moved to the <i>Ganges</i> as flag-lieutenant to Sir Robert Waller Otway, and was soon (13 November 1828) appointed to take command of the brig <i>Beagle</i>, following the suicide of her former commander, Captain Pringle Stokes. The <i>Beagle</i> and the <i>Adventure</i>, under Captain Phillip Parker King, were engaged in charting the coasts of southern South America. Here FitzRoy's seamanship and endurance were tested when he and his surveying crew spent thirty-three days in an open whaleboat in the depths of the subantarctic winter while exploring away from their ship. On this voyage FitzRoy carried four young Fuegians back to England; one man died soon after landing, the others were kept and educated at FitzRoy's expense [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72137/', "Exotic visitors (act. c.1500&#150;c.1855)")</script>].<br>
<br>Having failed to win the parliamentary seat for Ipswich, FitzRoy sailed in the <i>Beagle</i> in November 1831 to return the Fuegians to their families, hoping that they would encourage their peoples to befriend British vessels and especially shipwrecked sailors in need of succour. He was accompanied on this voyage by Charles Darwin. The two men lived in reasonable harmony during the five years that they were away, though Darwin recognized that FitzRoy's drive and ardour, so laudable in most respects, could on occasion lead him to overreact and take offence where none was intended. This aspect of FitzRoy's character, forgivable perhaps in a young man in trying situations, was to dog him throughout his life, yet the fact that many of his crew re-enlisted for the second voyage testifies to their faith in his seamanship and their respect for him as commander. He was promoted to captain on 3 December 1834.<br>
<br>FitzRoy's hopes for his Fuegians were soon dashed. The main purpose of the voyage being, however, to continue his survey, he decided, without seeking approval, to purchase a companion ship to make the task easier and safer. This impetuous action earned him a rebuke from the Admiralty, which declined to reimburse his considerable expenses. His course home lay across the Pacific and round the Cape of Good Hope, for his instructions included the taking of astronomical observations at certain ports, whereby their longitudes might be more accurately fixed.<br>
<br>The <i>Beagle</i> arrived home in October 1836. On 8 December FitzRoy married Mary Henrietta, daughter of Major-General Edward James O'Brien; in 1841 the couple made 25 Lowndes Square, Belgravia, their town residence. Four children were born, one dying in infancy. FitzRoy's narrative of the <i>Beagle</i> voyages was published in 1839, Darwin's volume on the zoology following in 1840. In July 1839 he was elected an elder brother of Trinity House.<br>
<br>FitzRoy's achievements as a surveyor were widely acclaimed. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him its gold medal in 1836 and Sir Francis Beaufort, the hydrographer, reported to parliament in 1848 that &#145;from the Equator to Cape Horn, and from thence round to the river Plata on the eastern side of America, all that is immediately wanted has already been achieved by the splendid survey of Captain Robert FitzRoy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1847&#150;8, 61.299).<br>
<br>In 1841 a general election was declared, and Lord Londonderry, FitzRoy's maternal uncle, offered him the tory candidature for co. Durham. After a quarrel with another tory candidate, William Sheppard, FitzRoy went on to win the seat. In parliament FitzRoy was responsible for a bill of 28 July 1842 &#145;for requiring and regulating examination of Masters and Chief Mates of Merchant Vessels&#146;, which was widely seen as one way to reduce the number of shipwrecks; the bill led to the <span class="roman">Mercantile Marine Act</span> of 1845, which made certificates obligatory. Appointed acting conservator of the River Mersey in September 1842, he journeyed up the river before preparing a report on its hydrology and how navigation might be improved. Later that year he escorted the visiting Archduke Friedrich of Austria around various dockyards and manufactories.<br>
<br>In February 1843 FitzRoy was appointed as the second governor of New Zealand, his predecessor, Captain William Hobson, having died in office. Accompanied by his wife and children and his father-in-law, he sailed in a mood of optimism, but arrived in December 1843 to find a country in domestic turmoil, punctuated by sporadic local warfare. Disillusioned by the way the land clause of the treaty of Waitangi (1840) was being applied in practice, the Maori population was divided in its response to the white settlers who were seeking to acquire land for farming. The settlers conceived their interests to be paramount, but FitzRoy held that the Maori had equal claim on his care and said so with more candour than prudence. His sentiments aroused the fiercest indignation among men whose close relatives had been massacred by the Maori. His manner, in the face of this opposition, was not conciliatory. It was spoken of as arrogant and dictatorial, as savouring more of the quarter-deck than of the council chamber. His financial policies were also inept. Admittedly, when swift decisions had to be taken, FitzRoy was hardly in a position to refer to Lord Stanley, the colonial secretary, for mail took several months to make the round journey; but even when he might have sought approval for his actions, he failed to do so, and one reason Stanley gave for his dismissal was his irritation at learning of FitzRoy's actions from third parties. FitzRoy incurred the enmity of the New Zealand Company, which was strongly represented in parliament. The government yielded to pressure; he was dismissed on 30 April 1845 and relieved in November. He sailed for home, with his family now augmented by a fourth child, Katharine O'Brien, born in 1844, and settled at Bradford in Wiltshire.<br>
<br>In September 1848 FitzRoy was appointed superintendent of the Woolwich Dockyard, to fit out and undertake trials of the <i>Arrogant</i>, a steam-powered screw frigate. The <i>Arrogant</i> proceeded to Gibraltar, frequently having to put in to port for attention to her boilers and engines. In February 1850 he retired from active service, though in the course of seniority he became rear-admiral in 1857 and vice-admiral in 1863. He served briefly as a managing director of the General Screw Steam Shipping Company, and equally briefly as personal secretary to his uncle Lord Hardinge. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1851, and a member of the Athenaeum in 1852. FitzRoy's wife died on 5 April 1852. On 22 April 1854 he married a distant cousin Maria Isabella Smyth, fourteen years his junior, at St Peter's, Eaton Square, Westminster; their daughter, Laura, was born in 1858.<br>
<br>Following the maritime conference at Brussels in 1853, the Board of Trade established a meteorological department, appointing FitzRoy as meteorological statist in 1854. FitzRoy launched himself vigorously into his new job, persuading ships' captains to send in weather logs, from which he compiled charts of winds and currents throughout the year across the oceans, intended to assist navigators to find the fastest and safest route to their destination. He resumed his investigations into the specific gravity of sea water, begun during his years in the <i>Beagle</i>, by carrying out tests on deep-sea thermometers. Convinced that the falling barometer generally heralded storms, he provided for display at ports and harbours around Britain the so-called &#145;coastal&#146; or &#145;fisheries&#146; barometers: these large, sturdy instruments carried &#145;FitzRoy's Rules&#146; for simple weather forecasting. His idea was to save lives by preventing small vessels from sailing when bad weather was imminent. His activities were supported and assisted by the British and Scottish Meteorological societies, and by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which elected him to its committee of management in 1859.<br>
<br>In a tremendous storm of October 1859 the steamer <i>Royal Charter</i> was wrecked off Anglesey with the loss of 459 lives. This disaster profoundly moved FitzRoy and strengthened his belief in the importance of predicting such storms. He arranged for weather reports from around Britain and the nearer continent to be telegraphed to his office, where he prepared what he called &#145;synoptic charts&#146;, a term still in use to denote charts showing conditions across an area at any one time. The first cautionary, or storm-warning, signals were sent in February 1861 to the Admiralty, Lloyd's, and various ports; from August 1861 they were published in newspapers. To warn vessels already at sea, FitzRoy devised a semaphore consisting of drums and cones which could be hoisted at headlands to indicate the expected force and direction of strong winds. Although he brought the term &#145;forecast&#146; into the meteorological vocabulary, FitzRoy emphasized that forecasts were not &#145;prophesies or predictions &hellip; the term forecast is strictly applicable to an opinion&#146;  (FitzRoy, <span class="italic">Weather Book</span>, 171). The fruits of his recent work added to the experience of his years at sea provided the material for his <span class="italic">Weather Book</span>, published in 1863, and soon reprinted and translated.<br>
<br>While FitzRoy's work was recognized and honoured abroad, the Board of Trade decided that he was exceeding his instructions, which were to collect data, and that forecasts should cease forthwith. FitzRoy became increasingly despondent, worried about his increasing deafness, and seeing opposition on all fronts, and from this time his mental health deteriorated. He normally sought relief from stress in hard work but this time he was too low for the medicine to take effect. On the morning of 30 April 1865, he rose and went into his dressing-room, where he cut his throat with his razor. He died at his suburban home, Lyndhurst, Westow Hill, Upper Norwood, Surrey. The coroner found that he had taken his life while of unsound mind, which allowed him to be buried at All Saints' Church, Upper Norwood, where his decayed gravestone was renewed by the Meteorological Office in 1981. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>FitzRoy is best remembered for his contributions to meteorology, particularly forecasting. The popular so-called &#145;Fitzroy barometers&#146;, consisting of a siphon barometer with attached thermometer and Fitzroy's Rules, are distinct from the coastal barometers; the former were manufactured only after his death and were still being made in the late twentieth century. His name was given to several geographical features in Patagonia and Australia, and on 4 February 2002 a shipping forecast area off north-west Spain (previously Finisterre) was named after him.<br>
