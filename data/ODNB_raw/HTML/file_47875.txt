<span class="headword">Whinney,  Frederick</span>  (1829&#150;1916), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 6 October 1829 in London, the son of Thomas Whinney (1793&#150;1853), a licensed victualler turned livery stable keeper, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Friberg, of German parentage. Little is known of his early life except that he appears to have assisted with the preparation of the stable's accounts during the 1850s, while an entry in a London trade directory for 1856 recorded a Frederick Whinney who advertised as a ship and insurance broker&#151;a possible connection which may have arisen from the fact that his grandfather had been a shipbroker in South Shields and his uncle continued in this business.<br>
<br>From December 1849 Whinney was employed as a clerk by Harding and Pullein, a City firm of accountants founded in 1848 by Robert Palmer Harding and Edmund Pullein. In November 1857 Whinney, then the senior clerk, was admitted to the partnership, and two years later the style was altered to include his name, as Harding, Pullein, Whinney, and Gibbons. When in 1883 Harding left the practice to take the post of chief official receiver, Whinney became the senior partner. At this time there were four partners (the other three being William Hurlbatt, John Smith, and Stanley Harding) and a possible amalgamation with Quilter, Ball &amp; Co. was discussed in December 1883, partly to prevent the latter from merging with their rivals, Turquand, Youngs &amp; Co., although in the event no union materialized.<br>
<br>&#145;Joining the profession at a very favourable time, Mr Whinney soon made a great reputation both as a liquidator and an auditor, and his practice was certainly one of the largest in his day&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Accountant</span>, 582). As a liquidator, Whinney could boast thirty appointments in 1866, and when Harding retired he completed the winding-up of Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., a task not completed until 1893. Unlike the pioneers of the accountancy profession, who prospered almost exclusively as insolvency experts, Whinney found that he was increasingly called upon to perform audit work. The Birmingham and Midland Bank (1885), Equitable Life Assurance Society (1894), Union of London and Smith's Bank (both 1883), and the Union Bank of Australia (1880) were among Whinney's audit clients. The fee income of his firm did not fluctuate greatly during the period of his senior partnership (rising from &pound;12,470 in 1883 to &pound;15,015 in 1900 and &pound;16,864 in 1904), as the era of great insolvency assignments was largely at an end and regular audit fees had come to constitute a higher proportion of earnings, increasing from 20 per cent in 1884 to 53 per cent by 1900.<br>
<br>It was common at this time for leading accountants to be appointed to the boards of major companies, and Whinney became a director of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (the firm acted as its auditors from 1892). He was deputed by the English Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1898 to give evidence for the <span class="roman">Companies Bill</span> then in committee with the House of Lords. In 1877 he had served on the parliamentary commission to inquire into the parlous state of Oxford University's finances, which prompted the invitation to audit the accounts of All Souls College, followed by those of the Oxford University Fund, the Randolph Hotel, and the Oxford Electric Lighting Company.<br>
<br>Whinney was involved in the efforts to establish accountancy as a recognized profession and became a leading member of the Institute of Accountants in London. William Turquand proposed him for its council in April 1877 as part of a more forceful policy designed to counter the rival Society of Accountants in England. In the event, the two bodies combined their campaign and were granted a royal charter in May 1880. Whinney followed Arthur Cooper as the third president in 1884 and held that office for four years. In 1896 he proposed that the institute sponsor a bill to create a monopoly for the profession. Under its terms, the right to practise as an accountant was to be limited to members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Society of Accountants and Auditors, together with all those at the time of the legislation who had been in business for three years. The scheme was defeated by 1046 to 433 votes.<br>
<br>For three years Whinney acted as treasurer of the London chamber of commerce; he also served as an officer in the 3rd volunteer battalion of the Middlesex regiment, and rose to the rank of major. Ernest Cooper recalled him as a man of strong character and dignified bearing: &#145;he showed me much kindness &hellip; He was, I think, proud of the commanding position his services to our profession had brought him. There was in him a touch of hauteur derived perhaps from his military service&#146;  (Cooper, 48).<br>
<br>Whinney was twice married. His first wife, whom he married in 1854, was Sarah Elizabeth Saltmarsh; they had four children before her death from cholera in 1860. His second marriage was to Emma Sophia Morley (<i>d</i>. 1891); of their ten children, Arthur (1861&#150;1927) and Frank Toller both entered the firm, and the former became its senior partner. Frederick Whinney died, aged eighty-six, on 15 May 1916 at his home, 85 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London.<br>
