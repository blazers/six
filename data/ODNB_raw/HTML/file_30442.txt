<span class="headword">Arkwright, Sir  Joseph Arthur</span>  (1864&#150;1944), <span class="occ">bacteriologist</span>, was born at Thurlaston, Leicestershire, on 22 March 1864, the youngest of the five children of Arthur William Arkwright, gentleman farmer, of Broughton Hall, Astley, and his wife and second cousin, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of John Wolley, of Beeston, Nottinghamshire. His great-great-grandfather, Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of machinery for textile manufacture, was one of several forebears who had won scientific distinction. Arkwright was educated at Wellington College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took the natural sciences tripos in 1884&#150;6 with zoology as his major subject. He completed his medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital and qualified in 1889. He held residential posts there and afterwards at the West London Hospital and the Victoria Hospital for Children. In 1893, he married Ruth (<i>d</i>. 1950), daughter of Joseph William Wilson, a civil engineer. They had three daughters, two of whom became doctors.<br>
<br>Arkwright settled in general practice at Halesowen, Worcestershire but was forced to give up owing to severe dermatitis. In 1906 he joined the staff of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, first as a voluntary worker, then from 1908 onwards as assistant bacteriologist. He retired in 1927 but continued to work at the institute as an honorary member of staff. From 1932 to 1944 he represented the Royal Society on the governing body of the institute.<br>
<br>Arkwright's early investigations were concerned with the spread of diphtheria in schools and the differentiation of meningococcus strains. Much of this work was summarized in a book entitled <span class="italic">The Carrier Problem in Infectious Diseases</span> (1912), which he wrote in collaboration with J. C. G. Ledingham. In 1915 he studied an epidemic of cerebrospinal meningitis among troops encamped on Salisbury Plain. Later that year he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and was posted to Malta as pathologist in charge of the laboratory at St George's Hospital; there he made interesting observations on convalescent carriers in bacillary dysentery, and on blackwater fever. In 1918 he was appointed a member of the War Office committee on trench fever, and with Arthur William Bacot and F. Martin Duncan he demonstrated the constant association of the virus of trench fever with <i>Rickettsia quintana</i> in lice.<br>
<br>The subject with which Arkwright's name will always be associated is, however, that of bacterial variation. Arkwright's researches on the variants denoted by him as R and S (rough and smooth) in bacilli of the dysentery and enteric group were reported in the <span class="italic">Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology</span> in 1921 and in his Bradshaw lecture to the Royal College of Physicians in 1929. In 1922 at the request of the Egyptian government he accompanied Bacot to Cairo to investigate the aetiology of typhus fever. After two months' work they both contracted the disease. Bacot died, and Arkwright recovered after a long illness. On returning to the Lister Institute Arkwright concentrated on animal diseases. His investigations into foot-and-mouth disease extended over more than twenty years. From 1925 onwards he was a member of the Ministry of Agriculture's committee on the subject and he became its chairman in 1931. He was a member of the Medical Research Council (1930&#150;34) and the Agricultural Research Council (1931&#150;40), and was chairman of the committee on <i>Brucella abortus</i> infection and on Johne's disease; he also chaired their joint committee on tuberculosis.<br>
<br>Arkwright was the author of more than fifty papers on bacteriology and immunology. He became FRCP in 1916 and FRS in 1926, and was knighted in 1937. Apart from his special studies, he was a man of wide culture and he possessed an exceptional knowledge of field botany and of horticulture. He died in King's College Hospital, London, on 22 November 1944, after a brief illness.<br>
