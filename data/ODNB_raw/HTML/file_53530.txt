<span class="headword">Harley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Holles]</span>,  Henrietta Cavendish</span>, countess of Oxford and Mortimer  (1694&#150;1755), <span class="occ">patron of architecture</span>, was born on 4 February 1694 at Newcastle House, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13556/', "John Holles, duke of Newcastle upon Tyne (1662&#150;1711)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Margaret Cavendish (1661&#150;1716), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40627/', "Henry Cavendish, second duke of Newcastle upon Tyne")</script>. After the deaths of his sons, Henry Cavendish had caused family controversy by leaving his estate to Margaret at the expense of her sisters, and her husband was on this basis allowed to take the title of Newcastle on being made a duke in 1694. To Henrietta, then, descended the wealth and castles of the Cavendish and Ogle families in Derbyshire and Northumberland, and Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire. Henrietta was acutely conscious of her ancestry and also inherited her family's traditional passion for horses; Horace Walpole described her homage to the &#145;great families from which she descended, and which centred in her&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.271). Her great-grandfather William Cavendish, first duke of Newcastle, had written the standard English work on horsemanship. His great-granddaughter's dun mare appears with her in portraits, and she is thought to have been the only woman whom the sporting artist John Wootton ever depicted in the saddle.<br>
<br>Henrietta too endured a complicated family wrangle. In 1711 she inherited much property from her father&#151;unfairly, according to her mother&#151;and it was during an estrangement lasting until just before Margaret's death that Henrietta married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12337/', "Edward Harley (1689&#150;1741)")</script>, son of the tory first minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12344/', "Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford and Mortimer")</script>. The wedding, &#145;in the Drawing Room at Wimple&#146; on 31 August 1713, was followed the next day by the nervous dispatch of letters to &#145;the Dutchess of Newcastle&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70440, 31 Aug/1 Sept 1713) informing her. Wimpole Hall, the Harley house in Cambridgeshire, expanded to form a setting for Edward Harley's famous collections, was sold in 1740 to pay debts. The couple had one surviving child, another Margaret (1715&#150;1785) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40752/', "Bentinck, Margaret Cavendish")</script>], who married William Bentinck, second duke of Portland. The Cavendish inheritance therefore passed through the female line yet again, from the Harley to the Bentinck family.<br>
<br>Henrietta's husband inherited the earldom of Oxford and Mortimer in 1724 but not his father's interest in politics, concentrating instead on his extensive collection of books and manuscripts. Following her husband's death in 1741, Henrietta dispersed his collection, the transactions culminating in the sale of the manuscripts to the nation for &pound;10,000, such a low price that it ranked as a tremendous gift, and she has often been criticized for her implied ignorance of the collection's value. In fact, her daughter communicated her spirited refusal to &#145;bargain with the publick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 2.183) to the House of Commons. Henrietta was a great reader herself, as the books in the library at Welbeck marked in her handwriting &#145;daer tuo&#146; (Goulding, 14: &#145;read out&#146; backwards) attest.<br>
<br>Henrietta's common reputation for being somewhat stiff-necked stems from a letter of Mary Pendarves (later Mrs Delany) of 1734 saying she was &#145;afraid Lady O. would have come&#146; to join a party, and that &#145;her formality would not by any means have agreed with the liberty of this constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 2.230). This view survived in her description as a &#145;dull, worthy woman&#146; in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. But Henrietta's supporters included her devoted correspondent Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who would round on detractors, saying, &#145;Lady Oxford is not shining, but she has more in her than such giddy things as you and your companions can discern&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Works</span>, 1.66). Jonathan Swift's high-flown verses on Henrietta's marriage contrast with his private view, in his journal, that she was &#145;handsome, and has good sense, but red hair&#146;.<br>
<br>&#145;I live as retired here as I can in this country where my ancestors had lived so long&#146;, Henrietta wrote from Welbeck Abbey to Lady Mary on 21 January 1747, &#145;but must see more company than I chuse&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70432). Her widowhood was spent in furious activity improving the house for her grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2162/', "William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, the future third duke of Portland")</script>. Walpole described her &#145;doing ten thousand right and just things &hellip; collecting and monumenting the portraits and reliques&#146; of her family and their ancestors  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.271). Her account books for &#145;the Repairing Beautifying &amp; Ornamenting the Ancient Seat of the Cavendishe Family at Welbeck&#146;  (Nottinghamshire Archives, MS DD. P5.6.1.1) have been preserved. They record the reconstruction of the west wing of the abbey, and inside the creation of medievalizing masterpieces such as the &#145;Gothic Hall&#146;, whose fantastic ceiling still survives. Marble fireplaces were based&#151;unusually for the period&#151;on her great-grandfather's Jacobean models at Bolsover Castle, another ancestral house which she repaired. The architect John James helped with the work until 1746, and in 1750 Henrietta reported her impatience with its progress. &#145;I have now above a hundred men employ'd, and entend to have more&#146;, she wrote to her grandson, &#145;The stuco men work by candle light night and morning&#146;  (Goulding, 32).<br>
<br>Henrietta's interests included the family documents collected by Arthur Collins, and her husband's librarian Humfrey Wanley himself was her devoted servant. She reorganized the pictures at Welbeck to create a veritable shrine to horses and to her ancestors. &#145;Oh! portraits!&#146; swooned Walpole in 1756, shortly after her death:<blockquote>I went to Welbeck. It is impossible to describe the bales of Cavendishes, Harleys, Holleses, Veres, and Ogles: every chamber is tapestried with them; nay, and with ten thousand other fat morsels; all their histories inscribed; all their arms, crests, devices, sculptures on chimneys of various English marbles in ancient forms (and, to say truth, most of them ugly.) (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.270&#150;71)</blockquote>Henrietta's death at Welbeck on 9 December 1755 of &#145;an apoplexy and palsy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.383) reunited her with her ancestors, for she was buried on 26 December &#145;in the old Duke of Newcastle's vault&#146;  (Chester, 389) at Westminster Abbey. Far from being a dull cipher as was once thought, she became through her intense family pride a vigorous and eccentric architectural innovator, despite&#151;or perhaps because of&#151;her reclusive later life.<br>
