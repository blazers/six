<span class="headword">Kyteler <span class="st"> [Kettle]</span>,  Alice</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1302&#150;1324), <span class="occ">alleged witch</span>, was a member of the Kyteler family of Flemish merchants who settled in Kilkenny in the thirteenth century. Her parentage is unknown but she is likely to be related to William le Kyteler, merchant of Ypres, who was trading in Ireland in 1277, to Joseph de Keteller who was buried in Kilkenny <i>c</i>.1280, and to William le Kyteler, sheriff of Kilkenny in the early fourteenth century. She married four times, each husband being a member of a wealthy and well-connected family in the Kilkenny area. Her first husband was William Outlaw, merchant and moneylender of Kilkenny, whom she probably married <i>c</i>.1280&#150;85 as their son, also William Outlaw, was sovereign (mayor) of Kilkenny in 1305. She may also have had a daughter, Rose, with her first husband. By 1302 she was married to her second husband, Adam Blund of Callan, with whom she engaged in moneylending activities. Their wealth is exemplified by a legal case in that year involving the sum of &pound;3000, which they had entrusted to William Outlaw. In June 1303 the king acknowledged a debt of &pound;500 to Adam Blund and Alice his wife, a loan to help finance the Scottish wars. Not long before his death in 1307&#150;8 Adam Blund quitclaimed to his stepson, William, all his goods and chattels, moveable and immoveable, jewels, gold, and silver and renounced all debts owed to him by William. By 1309 Alice was married to her third husband, Richard Valle, a landholder of Tipperary; in 1310 they assigned to William Outlaw two debts of 200 marks and &pound;200 owed to them by others. After Valle's death <i>c</i>.1316 Alice took proceedings against her stepson, Richard, for the recovery of her widow's dower. Between that year and 1324 Alice married her fourth husband, John Poer.<br>
<br>It is for the accusations of sorcery and witchcraft brought against her by Richard Ledred, bishop of Ossory, in 1324 that Alice is chiefly known. The principal source is the <span class="italic">Narrative of the Proceedings Against Dame Alice Kyteler</span>, a detailed account probably drawn up by or on behalf of Bishop Ledred to justify and defend the part played by him in prosecuting Alice and eleven co-accused. It tells a dramatic story, portraying the bishop as a staunch defender of the faith and upholder of the jurisdiction of the church against a &#145;diabolical nest of heretics&#146; combined with the might of leading members of the royal administration and ecclesiastical and lay magnates of the lordship of Ireland. The <span class="italic">Narrative</span> opens with accusations of heresy and witchcraft against Alice, following a visitation of the diocese. Seven charges are listed but the sixth charge stands out as the one which must have given rise to the whole affair. It states that the sons and daughters of Alice's four husbands had brought accusations before the bishop that she had used sorcery to kill some of her husbands and to infatuate others, and that she had so enfeebled their senses that they had given all their possessions to her and her son, to the impoverishment of their own children. Her fourth husband, John Poer, is said at this time to be totally debilitated by her sorceries but to have discovered in her possession a sackful of detestable items which he brought to the bishop. As a successful moneylender and a thrice widowed lady Alice must have amassed a considerable fortune, and it is not surprising to find a charge of sorcery being brought against her by her stepchildren, who resented the wealth inherited at their expense and the favour shown to her son William. The co-accused are not listed until later in the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> but it is soon apparent that William Outlaw is among them. Such charges were traditionally tried at common law and up to this time were regarded only as serious as the harm done to the victim; they bore no heretical implications.<br>
<br>The other charges brought against Alice and her co-accused concerned denial of the faith, making sacrifices to a demon, invoking the aid of demons in the practice of their sorceries, concocting potions in the skull of a decapitated robber using assorted unsavoury ingredients, and finally Alice's employment of an incubus known as Robin Artisson, a lesser demon of hell. What is so remarkable about the Kyteler case is the introduction of charges of demonic association, unknown at this time in the British Isles. This is probably attributable to the presence of Bishop Ledred as prosecutor. At the time of his appointment to the see of Ossory in 1317 he was resident at the papal court at Avignon where the recent case against the templars had given currency to the notion that the practice of magic implied demonic association. Thus, when a casual charge of malefice and sorcery was brought against Alice by her stepchildren, Ledred was bound by his training at Avignon to look for evidence of consorting with demons, and the use of the inquisitorial procedure meant that confirmation of such fears was readily forthcoming. It seems likely that the lurid details of the &#145;charges&#146; listed at the beginning of the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> did not emerge until the examination under torture of some of the accused, especially Petronella of Meath. Petronella's confessions are detailed later in the course of the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> and are clearly reflected in the list of charges appearing at the beginning. Without the protection afforded to Alice by her influential relatives and friends, Petronella was burnt at the stake on the morrow of All Souls' (3 November 1324).<br>
<br>Bishop Ledred pursued the case against Alice with determination fortified by conviction, but he encountered strong opposition to his attempts to have her arrested. The seneschal of the liberty of Kilkenny, Arnold Poer, was contemptuous of the bishop's efforts and obstructed him at every move. When a day had been appointed for William Outlaw to appear before the bishop to answer the charges against him, Poer had the bishop imprisoned until the appointed day had passed. The bishop next wrote to Roger Outlaw, chancellor of Ireland from 1322 and a close relative of William, demanding the arrest of all the accused but he refused on the grounds that he could not issue a warrant until they had been excommunicate for forty days. When the bishop summoned Alice to appear before him she fled to Dublin before the day appointed. Bishop Ledred was himself twice summoned to Dublin to answer to the archbishop for having placed his diocese under interdict and on a countercharge of defamation brought by Alice. The tide had begun to turn in Ledred's favour when the justiciar, John Darcy, lent his support, and writs for the arrest of the accused were finally issued in July 1324. Some were arrested and interrogated by the bishop, others were released on payment of securities, but the &#145;mistress of all&#146;, Alice Kyteler, fled to England with Basilia, daughter of Petronella of Meath.<br>
<br>With the departure of Alice, William Outlaw now became the focus of the bishop's attention. He was summoned to appear before the bishop to answer thirty-four charges, including heresy, aiding and abetting heretics, usury, perjury, adultery, and clericide. But when the council met in Kilkenny in July 1324 the chancellor, Roger Outlaw, and the treasurer, Walter Islip, took up residence with William and held court there, to the consternation of the bishop. Clearly William was not to be yielded up as readily as the less fortunate Petronella. Although the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> states that the bishop had to refuse money offered by William's friends to secure his favour, a form of compromise was reached. William confessed to the charges in return for which a prison sentence was commuted to a penance, namely, to hear mass at least three times a day for one year, to feed a certain number of the poor, and to roof the chancel of the cathedral of St Canice with lead. Evidently William proved recalcitrant as in January 1325 the bishop had him committed to prison and cited to answer new charges. But the power of William's supporters was such that the new agreement reached on 17 January 1325 required only the addition of securities for his behaviour. On 25 January Roger Outlaw and ten of the principal landholders of Kilkenny acknowledged a debt of &pound;1000 to the bishop of Ossory.<br>
<br>The events of 1324 were largely responsible for Bishop Ledred's enforced and prolonged exile from his diocese which commenced in 1329. Arnold Poer, convicted of heresy by the bishop, died excommunicate in a Dublin prison in 1329; the chancellor, Roger Outlaw, accused of aiding and abetting Poer in his heresy, purged himself of the charge at the parliament in Dublin in 1329. But the ultimate fate of the chief protagonist, Alice Kyteler, is unknown to history.<br>
