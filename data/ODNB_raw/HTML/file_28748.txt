<span class="headword">Warmestry,  Gervase</span>  (1604&#150;1641), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the second son of William Warmestry (<i>d</i>. 1640), principal registrar of the diocese of Worcester, and of his wife, Cicell (<i>d</i>. 1650), daughter of Thomas Smith of Cuerdley in Lancashire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28749/', "Thomas Warmestry")</script> was his younger brother. The Warmestrys were an ancient Worcester family who gave their name to the Warmestry Slip, a narrow street leading down from the city to the Severn, where their house formerly stood. The post of registrar of the diocese of Worcester had been held by a Warmestry since 1544 and Gervase was born and brought up in the city believing he would follow in this family tradition. He was educated first at Worcester grammar school, then moved on to Westminster School, and in 1621 was elected a scholar of Christ Church, Oxford. He matriculated on 24 July 1624 and graduated BA on 5 May 1625 and MA on 27 June 1628; in November 1628 he became a student of the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>Warmestry contributed a Latin poem to <span class="italic">Camdeni insignia: a Collection of Panegyrics on William Camden</span> (1624), but is more notable for a poetical tract entitled <span class="italic">Virescit vulnere virtus: England's Wound and Cure</span> (1628). It is a characteristic appeal to patriotism, couched in a poem dedicated to Endimion Porter, esquire, and written following the duke of Buckingham's disastrous expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in 1627. This military humiliation, and its loss of men, had left king and parliament very much divided. A copy of the work, which is scarce, is in the Bodleian Library; it bears no name of place of publication nor of printer and was probably privately printed. The poem was reprinted in 1875 in the second series of <span class="italic">Fugitive Tracts, written in Verse, which Illustrate the Condition of Religious and Political Feeling in England, and the State of Society there during Two Centuries</span> (ed. W. C. Hazlitt). Warmestry's work was chosen as one of the few to throw light on the condition of England in the year leading up to the assassination of the duke of Buckingham, when crisis seemed close at hand.<br>
<br>Warmestry succeeded his father as registrar of the diocese of Worcester, having been appointed in reversion on 20 November 1630. He died on 28 May 1641 and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. He left a widow, Isabella, to whom letters of administration were granted in London on 31 August 1641.<br>
