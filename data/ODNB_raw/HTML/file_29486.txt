<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Anna</span>  (1706&#150;1783), <span class="occ">poet and companion of Samuel Johnson</span>, was born at Rosemarket, Pembrokeshire, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29566/', "Zachariah Williams (1668x73&#150;1755)")</script>, medical practitioner and scientific experimenter, and his wife, Martha. Dr Williams provided his daughter with a good and wide-ranging education in the arts and sciences, including French and Italian. In 1726 or 1727 she moved to London with her father, where she helped him while he worked on his experiments to prove longitude by means of magnetism. Her sight was failing in the 1740s, but she was able to work at sewing and to publish in 1746 a translation from the French of a life of the emperor Julian.<br>
<br>From 1745 Anna's father, a resident at the Charterhouse since 1729, became bedridden. She accompanied him as his only helper, living at the hospital until 1748, when his eviction led to a plea for assistance from Dr Johnson. Johnson had taken an interest in Williams's experiments, and assisted him with publishing his theory of longitude. Anna became a companion to Mrs Johnson shortly before her death. At this time Johnson arranged for her to have an operation on her cataracts by Samuel Sharp; this proving unsuccessful, she became a member of his household. From that date she lived with Johnson in his various residences, except for the period from 1759 to 1765, when Johnson left his house in Gough Square and moved into the Inner Temple; then Anna took lodgings in Bolt Court, Fleet Street. It was at these lodgings that Johnson drank tea with her &#145;every night &hellip; before he went home, however late it might be, and she always sat up for him&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.421) and where in August 1763 Boswell proudly made good his &#145;title to be a privileged man&#146; by being &#145;carried by him in the evening to drink tea with Miss Williams&#146;  (ibid., 463).<br>
<br>In 1765 Williams again took up a place in Johnson's household at 7 Johnson's Court, Fleet Street, moving with him in March 1776 to 8 Bolt Court, where she lived until her death. She had a ground-floor apartment in both houses, from which she supervised the household management and expenses.<br>
<br>Johnson was always assiduous in helping Williams to extend her small income. She had annual gifts of money from acquaintances, including Lady Philipps of Picton Castle, an old family friend. Johnson arranged for David Garrick to give a benefit performance of Aaron Hill's <span class="italic">Merope</span> at Drury Lane theatre on 22 January 1756 &#145;for a gentlewoman deprived of her sight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 1.83) which is said to have raised &pound;200. In 1774 he helped her application to Hetherington's charity at Christ's Hospital; this failed because Welsh applicants were ineligible. In 1766 her <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span> was published as a handsome quarto by Thomas Davies. Johnson contributed a preface and several prose and verse pieces. The work had been first advertised in 1750, and there were waspish claims from Anna's friends that Johnson had not exerted himself in its production, but the publication was moderately successful, and earned the author about &pound;100. A previous publishing project in 1754&#151;a dictionary of philosophical terms probably inspired by Johnson's own lexicography&#151;came to nothing, but was supported by Johnson who wrote to Richardson the printer that &#145;she understands chimistry and many other arts&#146;  (ibid., 1.54).<br>
<br>As a writer Williams had craft but not genius. <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> is a collection of disparate pieces, verse, prose, and dramatic fragments. Her own verse is capable and clearly influenced by Pope:<blockquote>
<div>For me, contented with a humble state<br>
</div>
<div>'Twas ne'er my care, or fortune, to be great.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>She writes effective if conventional occasional verses, a typical example being &#145;On the Death of Sir Erasmus Philipps, Unfortunately Drowned in the River Avon&#146;.<br>
<br>Williams was regularly present when Johnson entertained at home, and accompanied him on visits, and if he dined at a tavern he sent a dish home for her. Her personality has been well described by many in the Johnson circle. All agree on her peevishness, intelligence, and well-stocked mind.<blockquote>She had a variety of literature, and expressed herself well, but her peculiar value was the intimacy in which she had long lived with Johnson, by which she was well acquainted with his habits, and knew how to lead him on to talk. (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.463)</blockquote>Johnson was not above playfulness towards her: Frances Reynolds records that he would &#145;whirl her about on the steps&#146; when visiting  (<span class="italic">Johnsonian Miscellanies</span>, 2.273).<br>
<br>As Williams grew old and frail her peevishness and intolerance towards the other members of the household increased, though Johnson's care for her was constant. He composed a prayer for her in her last illness, and after her death on 6 September 1783, he wrote: &#145;Her curiosity was universal, her knowledge was very extensive, and she sustained forty years of misery with steady fortitude. Thirty years and more she has been my companion, and her death has left me very desolate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 3.74).<br>
