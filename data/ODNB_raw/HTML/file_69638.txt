<span class="headword">Meyer,  Philip James</span>  (1737&#150;1820), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born in Strasbourg, Alsace, France, and studied for the ministry at the protestant college there, singing in the church choir and playing the organ. After he discovered an old German harp and learned to play it, he left the college about 1757 and went to Paris, where he had lessons from Christian Hochbrucker, nephew of Jacob Hochbrucker, usually regarded as the inventor of the single-action pedal harp: Christian Hochbrucker, later <i>ma&icirc;tre de harpe</i> to Queen Marie-Antoinette, was the first composer to publish music for the pedal harp. The pedal harp gradually replaced the old &#145;hook harp&#146;, on which semitones were produced by hooks turned with the left hand during performance. The addition of pedals to turn the hooks left both hands free. Meyer's first solo performance was for the Concert Spirituel in Paris in 1761, and he performed there until 1764, often playing his own works. He later studied German music with Johann Gottfried M&uuml;thel, a composer and organist, who had had lessons from Johann Sebastian Bach shortly before Bach's death. In 1763 he published one of the earliest tutors for the harp, <span class="italic">Essai sur la vraie mani&egrave;re de jouer de la harpe</span>, for beginners and amateurs, and this was followed by <span class="italic">Nouvelle m&eacute;thode pour apprendre &agrave; jouer de la harpe</span> (1774). In these he gave instructions for playing both the hook harp and the pedal harp. Meyer was married in Strasbourg in 1768, and had two sons, both harpists.<br>
<br>Meyer first visited London in 1772, and is thought to have been the first person to play the pedal harp in England. For the next few years he divided his time between London, Strasbourg, and Paris, which had become the centre of the harp industry, especially after the arrival of Marie-Antoinette, already an accomplished player, in 1770. He turned his hand to opera with <span class="italic">Dam&egrave;te et Zulmis</span> (1780) and, probably, <span class="italic">Apollon et Daphn&eacute;</span> (1782) (although this was possibly written by the Bohemian composer Anton Mayer), both failures when performed at the Paris Op&eacute;ra, and his <span class="italic">V&eacute;nus et Adonis</span> (1782) was withdrawn without being performed. The playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais asked him to compose a score for his new edition of Voltaire's libretto of <span class="italic">Samson</span>, originally written for Jean-Philippe Rameau in 1734, but Meyer's version was rejected by the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Musique in 1783.<br>
<br>Meyer settled permanently in London in 1784 and devoted the rest of his life to teaching the harp, which had become very fashionable (especially among young ladies), and composing. His earliest compositions, including six divertimenti for harp and violin (1767) and two sets of six sonatas for solo harp (1768 and 1770), were published in Paris. In London, his published works included sonatas for harp and strings, duets for harp and keyboard and for two harps, and a <span class="italic">Collection of Hymns and Psalms</span> (1815) for harp and piano, dedicated to Princess Charlotte. He also arranged many songs for the harp. Meyer died in London on 17 January 1820.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69638"></a><span class="headword">Philip James Meyer</span>  (1770&#150;1849), <span class="occ">musician</span>, the elder son of Philip James Meyer, was born in Paris and moved to London with his family in 1784. Regarded as an excellent performer, with a sensitivity compared to that of Anne-Marie Krumpholz, he accompanied the leading singers of the day, including Gertrude Elizabeth Mara (1749&#150;1833). A popular work was the arrangement for harp and piano by Thomas Greatorex (1758&#150;1831) of the glee &#145;O strike the harp&#146;, first performed by Meyer and Greatorex on 27 April 1798 at the King's Theatre Room. Meyer also accompanied ballets, including <span class="italic">Les follies d'Espagne</span> at the King's Theatre on 15 June 1789, played in concerts at Covent Garden and Drury Lane and at private parties, and played for the Covent Garden oratorios in 1791 and for the Drury Lane oratorios in 1791&#150;2. He also composed for the harp. He was appointed harpist to Queen Charlotte. Meyer wrote an unpublished biography of his father, which he sent to John Sainsbury in 1823 when he was compiling his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Musicians</span> (1824). He died at Pentonville, London, on 18 October 1849.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69639"></a><span class="headword">(Frederic-)Charles Meyer</span>  (1780&#150;1840), <span class="occ">musician</span>, the younger son of Philip James Meyer, was born in Strasbourg. Although he is recorded as having performed on the harp at Covent Garden and the Pantheon in 1791&#150;2, and for the ballet <span class="italic">La foire de Smyrne</span> at the Haymarket Theatre on 14 April 1792, and he played in the Drury Lane oratorios in 1794, he was primarily a teacher and composer. He composed sonatas for the harp, and also published <span class="italic">Divertimento Delia</span>, <span class="italic">Il pensieroso</span>, <span class="italic">Introduction and Solo</span>, and <span class="italic">Fantasia and Solo</span>, and his harp tutor, <span class="italic">A New Treatise on the Art of Playing upon the Double Movement Harp</span>, appeared about 1825. Meyer was one of the performers of &#145;A New Bardic Overture&#146; for six harps at the King's Theatre on 25 April 1816. He died in 1840.<br>
