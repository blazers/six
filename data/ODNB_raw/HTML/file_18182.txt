<span class="headword">Martin,  George William</span>  (1825&#150;1881), <span class="occ">music teacher and composer</span>, was born in London on 8 March 1825. He began his musical studies as a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral, under William Hawes, and was one of the choirboys at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of Queen Victoria. He taught music at the Normal College for Army Schoolmasters in Chelsea, was resident music master at St John's Training College, Battersea, from 1845 to 1853, and became the first organist of Christ Church, Battersea, when it opened in 1849. In 1860 he established the National Choral Society, and subsequently for some years staged a successful series of oratorio performances at Exeter Hall. In connection with these performances he edited and published cheap editions of the oratorios and other works of the great masters then not readily accessible to the public. He was also the editor of a number of minor music periodicals. In 1864 he organized a choir of a thousand voices for the <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> music at the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. He had a special aptitude for training choirs of schoolchildren, and conducted the Metropolitan Schools Choral Society and the National Schools Choral Festival at the Crystal Palace in 1859. As a composer his talent was for the madrigal and partsong, and the publication of his prize-winning glee &#145;Is she not beautiful?&#146; in 1845 marked the beginning of a successful period, during which few years passed without his winning distinction from some of the leading glee and madrigal societies in the country. &#145;No composer since the days of Dr Callcott has obtained so many prizes as Mr Martin&#146;, commented <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1856. The tune &#145;Leominster&#146;, associated with Bonar's hymn &#145;A Few More Years Shall Roll&#146;, became one of his best-known compositions.<br>
<br>It is reported by a contemporary that, owing to intemperance, Martin sank from &#145;a position which at one time gave him a claim to be regarded as one of the elements of musical force in the metropolis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Musical Record</span>, 1 May 1881). He died, apparently destitute, in Bolingbroke House Hospital, Wandsworth, London, on 16 April 1881, and was buried by the parish in Brookwood cemetery, Woking.<br>
