<span class="headword">Stainton,  Henry Tibbats</span>  (1822&#150;1892), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 13 August 1822 in London, where he was baptized on 8 September 1822 at St Benet Paul's Wharf, the eldest son of Henry Stainton, and his wife, Sarah <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tomkison. His father was originally from Lewisham; the family returned there when Stainton was a few weeks old. He was educated almost entirely at home, but finally attended King's College, London. For several years he was engaged as a businessman under his father. On 28 May 1846 he married Jane Isabel (<i>b</i>. 1818/19), youngest daughter of Thomas Dunn, a merchant, of Sheffield. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>About 1840 Stainton turned to entomology, apparently through the influence of his father's friend, the Revd W. Johnson. In particular, he became interested in the Microlepidoptera and Tineidae (clothes moths), rising at five in the morning to pursue his studies. Stainton published his first paper in 1845 and became the author of a number of works, mostly restricted to British fauna. These included <span class="italic">An Attempt at a Systematic Catalogue of the British Tineidae and Pterophoridae</span> (1849), <span class="italic">A Supplementary Catalogue of the British Tineidae and Pterophoridae</span> (1851), <span class="italic">The Entomologist's Companion</span> (1852; later edn, 1854), <span class="italic">Catalogue of British Micro-Lepidoptera</span> (1854), <span class="italic">Insecta Britannica: Lepidoptera-Tineina</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Tineina</span> (13 vols., 1855&#150;73), <span class="italic">June: a Book for the Country in Summer Time</span> (1856), <span class="italic">A Manual of British Butterflies and Moths</span> (2 vols., 1857&#150;9), and <span class="italic">British Butterflies and Moths: an Introduction to the Study of our Native Lepidoptera</span> (1867). He also wrote two works on the Tineina of Syria and Asia Minor (1864) and southern Europe (1869).<br>
<br>Stainton contributed some hundred papers on entomological subjects to various scientific journals. He also edited and supplied notes to James Francis Stephens's <span class="italic">Catalogue of British Lepidoptera</span> (1856), Brackenridge Clemens's <span class="italic">The Tineina of North America</span> (1872), and to the <span class="italic">Larvae of British Butterflies and Moths</span> (1886&#150;1901) by the entomologist William Buckler. An ardent collector of both native and foreign specimens, Stainton made several trips to the south of France.<br>
<br>In 1848 Stainton joined the Entomological Society of London. He succeeded Edward Doubleday (1810&#150;1849) as secretary of that society in 1850, but quit the post about 1851 or 1852&#151;partly owing to his poor relationship with E. W. Janson (1822&#150;1891), and partly to allow him to work on his contribution to <span class="italic">Insecta Britannica</span>. However, he later served as president (1881&#150;2), and his interest in the society lasted until his death. He used his own personal wealth to make numerous financial contributions to the society; he also did much to increase its membership list. In 1855 he started the <span class="italic">Entomologist's Annual</span> which continued until 1874. In 1856 Stainton established the <span class="italic">Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer</span>, which went through ten volumes before being discontinued. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1859, and held the post of secretary from 1869 (following the resignation of George Busk) until 1874; he was also vice-president of the society from 1883 to 1885. In 1864 he co-founded the <span class="italic">Entomologist's Monthly Magazine</span>, maintaining a connection with the journal until his death.<br>
<br>On 6 June 1867 Stainton was elected FRS. (Between 1880 and 1882 he served on council.) He attended the meetings of the British Association, and acted as secretary to the biology section in 1864, and also from 1867 to 1872. He became secretary of the Ray Society in 1861, a post he held until 1872. In 1871 he was instrumental in founding the Zoological Record Association (of which he was secretary from 1871 to 1886), which ensured publication of the <span class="italic">Zoological Record</span>, from 1871 until 1886 (when it was taken over by the Zoological Society of London). He was also a member of the entomological societies of France, Stettin, and Italy, and an honorary member of those societies of Belgium and Switzerland.<br>
<br>Stainton died from stomach cancer on 2 December 1892 at his residence, Mountsfield, Lewisham, and was buried on 7 December in the family vault at St Mary's, Lewisham (Lewisham Old Church), five days later. He was survived by his wife, Jane Isabel, who presented the Entomological Society of London with about 800 volumes and pamphlets from his library, following his death. Stainton was described (in the obituary notice printed in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Linnean Society</span>) as &#145;a genial and generous friend and a painstaking industrious worker&#146;. He was also noted as a meticulous and self-critical scientist who took a &#145;truly biological approach to taxonomy&#146;.<br>
