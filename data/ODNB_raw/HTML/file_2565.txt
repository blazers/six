</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blair, Sir  James Hunter</span>, first baronet  (1741&#150;1787), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born James Hunter on 26 February 1741 at Ayr, the second of three sons of John Hunter (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1762), a wealthy merchant and probably banker of Mainholm, later of Brownhill, both in Ayrshire, and Anna, daughter and heir of William Cunningham of Brownhill. He had a younger sister, Elizabeth. Hunter was apprenticed to the Edinburgh banking house of the Coutts brothers in 1756, where he met Sir William Forbes, who became a lifelong friend and colleague. When the Coutts partnership was weakened by the death in 1761 of its principal, John Coutts, Forbes successfully persuaded the family in London to give an interest in the firm to himself and to Hunter, who inherited &pound;5000 from his father's estate in 1762.<br>
<br>The Edinburgh bank traded under the name of John Coutts until 1773, when the name became Sir W. Forbes, J. Hunter &amp; Co., and these two principals conducted the firm in complete harmony until Hunter's death in 1787. Hunter was for some years, but to a lesser extent than Forbes, concerned in the London enterprises of Sir Robert Herries, who had briefly trained with them at the Edinburgh bank.<br>
<br>In December 1770 Hunter married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1817), eldest daughter of John Blair of Dunskey House near Portpatrick in Wigtownshire, and they had at least nine children; his wife had six brothers but they all predeceased her, and when Jane inherited her father's estate, in 1777, Hunter assumed the surname of Blair. It was only after this marriage, in the last ten years of his life, that Blair became particularly well known. He had an interest in the development of Portpatrick, the town from which the shortest crossing to Ireland might be made (to Donaghadee), and he combined this with a concern for urban improvements in Edinburgh. The latter projects were by far the more successful in the long term. Despite his enhancements to the harbour and the provision of better packet-boats, Portpatrick remained little more than a village; it was to be further eclipsed by Stranraer in the steam age.<br>
<br>In 1781 and 1784 Blair represented Edinburgh in parliament. A single speech has been documented, on 4 August 1784, when he argued against the imposition of new duties on linen and cotton and &#145;proved his extensive knowledge of the trade and manufactures of Scotland. His arguments were pointed and conclusive&#146;  (Haden-Guest, 658). A supporter of William Pitt (1759&#150;1806), Blair vacated his seat later in 1784 to make way for Sir Adam Fergusson.<br>
<br>Blair became lord provost of Edinburgh in 1784 and set about schemes to improve the university buildings and, more especially, the accessibility of the city centre from the southern suburbs. His enduring memorial is the south bridge over the Cowgate, which was linked to the earlier north bridge on the opposite side of High Street. The south bridge formed part of a viaduct of twenty-two arches, mostly hidden from view, which carried a new road, flanked by new development, towards Nicolson Street. This major project was bitterly controversial, both because of the levies and tolls proposed for the funding, and because of the longer-term fear that people would migrate to the suburbs to avoid the taxes of the inner city. The Edinburgh historian Hugo Arnot, writing at a time when he believed the scheme had been defeated, denounced it at length as &#145;iniquitous&#146; and &#145;absurd&#146;  (Arnot, 250); paradoxically his appendix, and the publisher's addendum after Arnot's death in 1786, were almost enthusiastic. The foundation stone of the bridge was laid on 1 August 1785; the structure was completed in the following year, though the new road to the south was not opened for carriages until March 1788. The scheme was a triumph, with building land alongside reputedly fetching &pound;100,000 per acre. Although it is usual also to associate the name of Sir William Forbes with the south bridge venture, Forbes himself wrote of it as being &#145;the magnificent idea&#146; of his colleague  (Forbes, 65).<br>
<br>Blair, who was made a baronet in 1786 as a result of the south bridge construction, did not live to see his ambition fully completed. He had gone to Harrogate in April 1787 for what Forbes called &#145;a scorbutic complaint&#146;  (Forbes, 64), and he died there quite suddenly on 1 July, aged forty-six, &#145;of a putrid fever&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 641). He was widely lamented, as a diligent, cheerful, and gregarious man, shrewd in business and honest in his principles. His caricature by John Kay depicts him as tall and corpulent. Forbes wrote that Blair was &#145;but little acquainted with books or literature&#146;  (Forbes, 65), but that he had won the friendship and respect of Robert Burns, who wrote an elegy on his death. As this poem includes the line &#145;The drooping arts surround their patron's bier&#146;  (Burns, <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span>), Forbes's comment might be too severe. Another poem or &#145;monody&#146; on Blair's death was published in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Blair was certainly well acquainted with prominent engineers, including John Smeaton, who worked at Portpatrick, and John Loudon McAdam. He was also interested in agricultural improvements, and raised standards among farmers near his Dunskey estate. He is commemorated by Blair Street and Hunter Square in Edinburgh (appropriately near the south bridge), and probably by Blair Terrace, formerly Blair Street, in Portpatrick. He was buried at Edinburgh, his six sons flanking the coffin on its journey to the Greyfriars churchyard on 11 July 1787. Between his death and his funeral, &#145;the music bells of Edinburgh&#146; had been silenced  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 641).<br>
