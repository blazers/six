<span class="headword">Cockburn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rutherford]</span>,  Alison</span>  (1713&#150;1794), <span class="occ">writer and literary hostess</span>, was born on 8 October 1713, the youngest of six children of Robert Rutherford of Fairnalee, Selkirkshire, and his wife, Alison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ker (<i>d</i>. 1723/4); her birthplace was the family's mansion house at Fairnalee. On 12 March 1731, at Ormiston parish church, she married Patrick Cockburn (<i>d</i>. 1753), the advocate son of Adam Cockburn of Ormiston, lord justice clerk; the couple had one son, Adam (1732&#150;1780), who became a captain in the dragoons. The marriage to Cockburn formally ended a romantic attachment to John Aikman, son of the painter William Aikman and a friend of Allan Ramsay. Alison's relationship with Aikman may have been the primary inspiration for her most famous lyrical lament &#145;Flowers of the Forest&#146;, although Sir Walter Scott attributed the occasion of its writing to a series of bankruptcies that devastated several ancient Selkirkshire families.<br>
<br>Although Alison Cockburn wrote poetry and songs throughout her life, only a few of her works were ever published. She seems to have regarded her poems as personal pieces or items to be shared with friends between dinner toasts. The enduring &#145;Flowers of the Forest&#146;, was only published in 1765 and initially not even under her name. When it first appeared many believed it to be an old ballad from the time of Flodden Field. Robert Burns, who recognized it as a more recent production, admired it nevertheless and imitated it in his own &#145;I dreamed I lay&#146; in 1776.<br>
<br>Like her husband, Alison Cockburn was a whig Presbyterian with no time for the Jacobite inclinations of some of her tory friends and relations. This was a potentially dangerous position at a time of Jacobite activity. Returning by coach from Ravelston, where she visited relations during the Jacobite siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1745, Alison was accosted by the &#145;grim officer on guard&#146; who proposed a search for &#145;Whig letters&#146;. In her pocket she carried a squib that she had composed on Bonnie Prince Charlie entitled &#145;Clout the Caldron&#146;; she was, however, spared the indignity of a search by the Ravelston arms on the coach  (Tytler and Watson, 2.79&#150;81). For several years from 1750 the couple lived on the estate of James, sixth duke of Hamilton, the duke having asked Patrick Cockburn to supervise his affairs while he was overseas.<br>
<br>Patrick Cockburn died on 29 April 1753 and was survived by his wife for another forty years. After her husband's death Alison transferred her residence to Edinburgh, where she helped to mould that city's dinner and drawing-room culture in the same way that a select set of French noblewomen ruled the salons of Paris. Her literary circle included David Hume, Henry Mackenzie, William Robertson, Lord Monboddo, David Dalrymple, John Home, and the young Walter Scott, her cousin on her mother's side. Cockburn lived long enough to act as &#145;a connecting-link between the Edinburgh of Allan Ramsay and Burns, and the Edinburgh of Scott&#151;her house was the rallying-ground, while she was herself a queen, of the literati of Edinburgh&#146;  (Tytler and Watson, 2.179&#150;80).<br>
<br>In the late twentieth century Alison Cockburn's reputation has owed much more to her effervescent correspondence, chronicling her role in the cultural and literary scenes of the day, than to her intermittent poems. Her correspondence is one of the finest sources of information on the changing social etiquette and Edinburgh season, visiting habits, balls and assemblies, and convivial dinners that characterized Edinburgh in the age of improvement and Enlightenment. This correspondence was only interrupted once, under the tragic circumstances of the death on 22 August 1780 of her son, Adam. Adam Cockburn had inherited the reserved character and fragile constitution of his father. His mother loved him deeply and one of the few times that her close friendship with David Hume was seriously tested was when her <i>bon</i> <i>David</i> failed to use an opportunity to promote her son's interest. Her &#145;Short account of a long life&#146;, which prefaces the 1900 edition of her correspondence, was dedicated to the Revd Robert Douglas of Galashiels.<br>
<br>Alison Cockburn's relationship with Hume was one of intimate friendship. She constantly chided him for his atheism, encouraged him to make his famous visit to France, suggested that he bring her &#145;beloved&#146; Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Scotland, and then took Hume's part against Rousseau when the latter proved a paranoid house guest. She even offered to find Hume a home and a wife when he settled down in Edinburgh. Their relationship was sufficiently close that she felt at ease to offer, whether in jest or in earnest, to &#145;play at quadrille and sleep with you. Will that do?&#146;  (Mossner, 533). Her connection with her cousin Walter Scott was more paternalistic. Their mutual admiration was firmly established when Walter was only six. While visiting Scott's father at his home in George Square, she pronounced the child prodigy &#145;the most extraordinary genius of a boy I ever saw&#146;. Walter Scott returned the compliment by telling his aunt that Alison Cockburn was &#145;a <i>virtuoso</i> like myself&#146;  (Lockhart, 1.119).<br>
<br>As a young woman Alison Cockburn's beauty must have been remarkable. Dignified and charming, she had sufficient wit and vivaciousness to attract considerable attention and was ranked among Edinburgh's most beautiful women in a published piece by a visiting Frenchman. A portrait painted by Anne Forbes in Alison Cockburn's mature years depicts the woman that befriended David Hume&#151;an open but clearly well-bred character with just a hint of sauciness. She died in Edinburgh on 22 November 1794 and was buried in Buccleuch parish church beside her son.<br>
