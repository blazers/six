<span class="headword">Metcalf <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pitt]</span>, Dame  Helen</span>  (1946&#150;2003), <span class="occ">headteacher</span>, was born on 7 October 1946 at North Middlesex County Hospital, Edmonton, London, the only daughter of Thomas Ralph Pitt, a public works engineer, and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nicholas. When she was four the family, which included a brother, emigrated to Rhodesia, but her father died soon after of lung cancer, so they returned. Her mother remarried a painter and decorator who had a son of his own and the couple went on to have a son themselves. The family was poor&#151;there was sometimes no food in the house as wage day approached&#151;but Metcalf was bright, attended Enfield county school, a grammar school, and studied modern history with economics and politics at the University of Manchester, graduating with an upper second-class degree in 1968. While a student there she met her future husband, David Henry Metcalf (<i>b</i>. 1942), who was canvassing for the Labour Party during the general election of 1966. He was the son of Geoffrey Metcalf, security officer, and by the time of their marriage on 20 July 1968 was a lecturer in economics at the London School of Economics (where he was professor of industrial relations from 1985).<br>
<br>Metcalf&#151;as she said later&#151;drifted into education. She took a teaching diploma at Roehampton Institute (and later a masters' degree in economic history at the London School of Economics). Her first job in 1969 was at Southgate Technical College, trying to interest young day-release apprentices in culture and citizenship. She relished the challenge. In 1971 she moved to Dame Alice Owens School, then a grammar school, in Islington, north London, and in the same year began a seven-year stint as a Labour councillor. As vice-chairman of housing and planning committees for Islington she became intimately involved in a huge programme of slum clearance. She had the stamina which saw her still arguing in committee at 3 a.m. over detail&#151;the need not to economize on double glazing, for instance. She believed housing quality had a direct impact on educational outcomes. Political colleagues and friends in the Labour Party included Jack Straw and Margaret Hodge, who both went on to high government office. If she had chosen national politics she could have been assured of a safe seat. But she knew the difficulties involved in juggling family life with a career in parliament and she chose to stay in education. She also felt that was where she could make the greatest impact on individual lives.<br>
<br>Metcalf left Dame Alice Owens in 1974 for a sabbatical year in the United States with her husband, David. On her return she was recruited to teach history at Islington Green School, then a tough, low performing, inner city comprehensive. In 1980 her only son, Tom, was born. In 1982 she became deputy head of Acland Burghley, another north London comprehensive.<br>
<br>In 1988 Metcalf was appointed head of Chiswick community school, which had a bad reputation because of poor results and even poorer discipline. She provided strong leadership, surrounding herself with a new team of deputies. She had little time for the view that you could not expect much of disadvantaged children&#151;she knew that from her own background. She insisted that lessons had to be interesting and challenging if behaviour was to be good. Breast cancer was diagnosed in 1991, the beginning of a long, gruelling, and ultimately unsuccessful battle, but she had treatment and was brave and unsentimental about her fate. She remained a hands-on headteacher, leading by example; once she played the recorder, which she was learning with her son, in a school assembly to encourage pupils to try music lessons. She was a highly visible presence in the corridors and would wade in to sort out trouble. Pupils knew they had her support, and so did her staff; she was concerned about teachers' pay, conditions, and career development, and many colleagues became lifelong friends, along with cleaners and cabinet ministers. Within ten years examination results at the school were in the top 5 per cent for schools with comparable intakes.<br>
<br>Metcalf was New Labour even before the term was introduced, and the new Labour government in 1997 turned to her to test ideas. In 1998 she was appointed DBE for services to education, and later that year Chiswick community school was the launch pad for the government's performance-related pay scheme. Metcalf shared a platform with Tony Blair, the prime minister, David Blunkett, the education secretary, and Estelle Morris, the school standards minister. Increasing health problems forced her to resign her post in 2001 but she lived long enough to see her beloved son graduate with a first in geography from Bristol University. She died of cancer at her home, 18 St Georges Avenue, Islington, on 3 December 2003. She was survived by her husband, David, and son, Tom. Feisty, charismatic, and emotionally intelligent, Metcalf had a combination of strategic vision and the practical application to get it realized. Humble origins, a disrupted childhood, and an excellent education produced a woman determined to see that others got fair chances. She was committed to state education and turned her vision of high standards into a reality.<br>
