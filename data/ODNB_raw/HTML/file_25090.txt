<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Senior,  Nassau William</span>  (1790&#150;1864), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was probably born on 26 September 1790 at Compton Beauchamp, Berkshire, although one source has it that he was born on 23 September 1790 at Uffington, Berkshire. He was the eldest of ten children of John Raven Senior (1764&#150;1824), son of a merchant trading overseas, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Henry Duke, solicitor-general of Barbados. Before entering Eton College in July 1803, Nassau was taught at home by his father (a graduate of Merton College, Oxford), who became vicar of Durnford, Wiltshire, in 1791. At the age of sixteen the boy went as a demy to Magdalen College, Oxford, where&#151;stung by failure at his first appearance in the schools&#151;he hired an outstanding coach, Richard Whately, only three years his senior, in whom he found a lifelong friend. After getting a first in classics in 1811, Senior became a probationary fellow of Magdalen in 1812. His ambitions were then focused on a career in the law. He had already entered Lincoln's Inn in November 1810 and in 1813 the award of the Oxford University Vinerian scholarship enabled him to dedicate himself to legal studies. As pupil to Edward Sugden, later lord chancellor, he became a certificated conveyancer and was introduced to an influential section of London society. In 1817 after Sugden had become master of chancery, Senior took over the thriving practice in which he had been trained. By the time he was called to the bar in 1819 he was already earning a comfortably rising income. In April 1821 he married Mary Charlotte Mair (1791&#150;1883), daughter of John Mair of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, and they set up their first London home at 32 Kensington Square. A few years later Senior built a larger house at 13 Hyde Park Gate. There they entertained a cosmopolitan variety of intellectually lively friends from 1827 until 1864.<br>
<br>The first published evidence of Senior's interest in political economy was an article discussing a recent parliamentary report on the state of agriculture, in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of July 1821 (he had already written several reviews on legal or literary subjects for the journal). The article attracted favourable notice from leading economists such as Ricardo, who wrote to H. Trower expressing satisfaction at having &#145;got so good an ally for what I think the correct principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works and Correspondence</span>, 9.120), and James Mill, who early in 1823 recommended Senior as a member of the recently formed Political Economy Club. For most of the next four decades Senior participated actively at the club's meetings, where current problems of economic theory and policy were regularly debated by prominent economists, bankers, businessmen, civil servants, and parliamentarians. By 1825 his credentials were sufficiently well attested for him to be appointed as the first incumbent of the Drummond chair of political economy at Oxford. It was during his 1825&#150;30 tenure of the professorship that he won wide respect as a lucid exponent of what was still an infant discipline. Most of the lectures he then delivered were subsequently published as pamphlets, or embodied in his first book, <span class="italic">Outline of the Science of Political Economy</span> (1836). He also provided an appendix defining &#145;Ambiguous terms in political economy&#146; for Richard Whately's <span class="italic">Elements of Logic</span> (1826). For several years he was an examiner in political economy at London University, which elected him to a fellowship in 1836.<br>
<br>By the age of forty Senior had acquired an enviable reputation in London society as a successful lawyer and economist whose judgement was considered basically sound by leading members of the Political Economy Club. Accordingly, in 1830, when Lord Melbourne became secretary of state for home affairs, he invited Senior to prepare a report on the laws relating to strikes and trade combinations. Characteristically, Senior responded by first systematically ascertaining the facts. Aided by a colleague expert in the common law, he circulated questionnaires and examined witnesses before presenting a carefully argued opinion. His report lay unpublished in Home Office files until 1841, when he embodied extracts from it in a parliamentary <span class="italic">Report on the Condition of the Handloom Weavers</span> (1841). Over thirty years later he reproduced it in full in the first volume of his <span class="italic">Historical and Philosophical Essays</span> (posthumously published in 1865)&#151;on the grounds that the law affecting trade unions remained as defective as ever.<br>
<br>Senior said in his introductory professorial lecture (1827) that his interest in political economy was largely motivated by humanitarian concern for the poor, and by a conviction that understanding the causes of poverty was an essential preliminary to relieving it. His earliest research in this area was provoked by Lord Howick's suggestion that he should examine the voluminous material published on the poor in Ireland. The most striking feature of his conclusions was that he advocated a positive economic role for government, going far beyond <i>ad hoc</i> measures designed to relieve the worst social distress. He suggested, for example, that chronic poverty in Ireland called for government intervention to make capital available for productive investment in roads, railways, harbours, docks, and canals, as well as to encourage consolidation of farms into more efficient units of operation and to subsidize emigration. These were highly unorthodox views in the current climate of economic opinion. He also scandalized Anglican opinion by advocating the confiscation and transfer to the Roman Catholic church (to which the majority of Irish people belonged) of a substantial proportion of the income of the established episcopalian church&#151;a recommendation so heretical that it is said to have forced his resignation from the chair of political economy at King's College, London, in 1830.<br>
<br>Senior continued to write on the Irish poverty problem, partly because frequent visits to his friend Whately (who was appointed archbishop of Dublin in 1831) kept his interest fresh and informed. However, in 1832 his attention was sharply focused on English poverty when he was appointed to the royal commission for inquiring into the administration and practical operation of the poor laws. In this case Senior's influence on the outcome was crucially important. Apart from Edwin Chadwick, he was the main driving force throughout the inquiry, from drafting the questionnaires circulated to all English parishes and identifying the relevant facts to be gathered by the twenty-six assistant (regional) commissioners for England and certain other countries (for purposes of international comparison), to writing the final report, published in 1834. Senior then acted as midwife to the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span> by careful explication and justification of the commission's recommendations to the lord chancellor and other cabinet ministers, and by continuously advising on the details of the consequent legislation as the bill went through parliament. He refused both a knighthood and the sum of &pound;500 as reward for his public services. Later he refused the offer of a Canadian governorship and the position of legal member of the Indian council. He also turned down a place on the new poor-law board. However, he accepted gratefully the appointment in 1836 as one of the twelve masters of chancery, a post that gave him an annual lifetime salary of &pound;2500 for duties which were more ceremonial than intellectually demanding and allowed him leisure to offer further uncompensated services to successive governments. In 1836, for example, he was consulted by the then home secretary, Lord John Russell, on Irish poor law reform; in 1837 he published <span class="italic">Letters on the Factory Act as it Affects the Cotton Manufacture</span>, addressed to the president of the Board of Trade, and was appointed to another royal commission&#151;this time on the condition of the unemployed handweavers. Again the inquiry began with a painstaking assembly of facts by a team of assistant commissioners, and again the final report was largely Senior's work. It offered a comprehensive and sympathetic account of the handweavers' plight, but suggested no practical remedies and gave rise to no subsequent legislation.<br>
<br>In 1847 Senior was re-elected to the Drummond chair for a second five-year stint, during which he planned to digest his many economic articles, lectures, pamphlets, letters of advice to ministers, and parliamentary reports into a single &#145;great book&#146;. He did not complete this project, no doubt partly because he failed to be elected for a further professorial term. Perhaps he was unable to achieve a sufficiently coherent analytical view of the subject. It is notable, for example, that when he reviewed J. S. Mill's magisterial <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1848) in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (October 1848), Senior was devastatingly sceptical both about the validity of what he called the &#145;science of political economy&#146; and about the practical utility for policy purposes of the associated &#145;art of political economy&#146;. Perhaps the completion of his &#145;great book&#146; was also hindered by the fact that he was constantly in demand as one of the most luminous and perceptive government advisers of his era; in 1857, for example, he was again appointed to a royal commission, this time on another of his favourite remedies for poverty&#151;popular education.<br>
<br>On the other hand, it is evident that during the last two decades of his life Senior's interests broadened considerably and that he spent an increasing amount of time talking and listening to the many European intellectuals and statesmen with whom he had developed close and enduring friendships. He had (since the early 1830s) been accustomed to spend the legal vacations travelling, often with his wife and two children, in England, Ireland, Belgium, France, or Italy&#151;where they were entertained by a multitude of friends who had already stayed at 13 Hyde Park Gate. Senior's company was as much in demand as his advice, because he had the most sociable and outgoing of personalities, and a talent for attracting, as well as delivering, stimulating conversation and correspondence. Lord Overstone, for example, who had accompanied him on a tour of Lancashire cotton factories in 1837, referred to his &#145;very acute and intelligent mind united with other qualities which render him a very desirable travelling companion&#146;  (O'Brien, 222). His lifelong friendships with Alexis de Tocqueville and Comte Cavour began on their first visits to London (in 1833 and 1836), but it was not until Senior's 1848 visit to Paris that he began to write detailed reports of his interviews with prominent Europeans, and eventually to fill a series of journals with firsthand accounts of revolutionary events described by informed observers. He published selections from his interchanges with French statesmen (such as Thiers and Guizot) in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>; the most interesting of the conversations were subsequently edited by his daughter and published posthumously in book form.<br>
<br>Nassau Senior retired from the professorship in 1862 and died at 13 Hyde Park Gate on 4 June 1864, after a short illness. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife and his two children: Mary Charlotte Mair (Minnie) Simpson (1825&#150;1907), to whom he willed full jurisdiction over his manuscripts, books, and pamphlets, and Nassau John Senior (1822&#150;1891), a lawyer. His daughter-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45504/', "Jane Elizabeth Senior (1828&#150;1877)")</script>, became the first woman to be appointed an inspector of workhouses and pauper schools.<br>
