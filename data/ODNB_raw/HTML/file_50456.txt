<span class="headword">Fortnum,  Charles</span>  (1738&#150;1815), <span class="occ">royal servant and grocer</span>, is presumed to be the son of William Fortnum, of Berkeley Street, Portman Square, London. He had a brother and a sister. His grandfather William Fortnum is said to have become a footman to Queen Anne in 1707, although the name is absent from the records of the lord steward's department. About the same time, William Fortnum senior had reportedly founded a grocery business in Duke Street, London, jointly with his landlord, <a name="cosubject_50456"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Mason</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1707&#150;1734)<span class="occ"></span>, owner of a shop in nearby St James's Market. In 1734 a Hugh Mason was appointed as porter at &#145;His Majesty's Royal Palace of Somerset House&#146;, while John Mason esquire, a &#145;gentleman of his majesty's Chapel Royal&#146; since 1715, was in 1744 made &#145;gentleman sewer in ordinary&#146;, the traditional job description of an attendant at the royal table. No documentary evidence of the Fortnum and Mason business appears to exist before 1756, when it moved to premises in Piccadilly that had been leased from Bethlem Hospital.<br>
<br>In August 1761 Charles Fortnum, then aged twenty-three, became footman to Sophie Charlotte, princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, shortly before her marriage to George III. The meagre salary of 40 guineas a year was amply supplemented by perquisites. Thus while his grandfather (so it was said) had been entitled to candle ends and any left unburned in candlesticks, Fortnum was allowed to help himself to coal, house linen, food, and wine. No doubt he succeeded in combining his duties with the running of the grocery because he worked at the former every alternate fortnight. In 1767&#151;on 26 December, after the last Christmas hamper had been sent on its way&#151;he married, at St James's Church, Westminster, Mary (1738&#150;1805), daughter of Edward and Mary Monday, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire. Two sons and a daughter survived him.<br>
<br>Fortnum's work at court helped him to build up an extensive clientele of wealthy and influential customers of his &#145;celebrated Italian warehouse&#146;. In addition to Italian goods such as fruit and olive oil the shop sold tea, coffee, and spices, most being imported through the agency of some Fortnum cousins employed in the East India Company. It was also famous for delicacies such as portions of poultry and game in aspic jelly, Scotch eggs, mince pies, fresh fruit in season, and dried fruits during the rest of the year. Goods were always dispatched in attractive hampers, baskets, and boxes; as a slightly later advertisement put it, &#145;Owing to the handsome packages, the above are particularly adapted for presents&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Dec 1817).<br>
<br>During the fraught period of George III's so-called madness, at the turn of the year 1788&#150;9 Fortnum is reported to have begged to resign owing to ill health, and also to allow him to concentrate on his grocery business. At that time the current Mason in the firm, John, who later became a partner, was only eighteen. Fortnum's wish to resign was mentioned in her journal by Mrs Charlotte Papendiek, wife of a colleague at court. The dramatist Alan Bennett used Fortnum as a character in his play <span class="italic">The Madness of George III</span> (1992), the subsequent film version showing him, quite ahistorically, sweeping out in anger at having to carry chamber pots containing the royal purple-tinged water.<br>
<br>In reality, his service in the queen's household remained unbroken for the rest of his life. In 1805 his wife died, but he did not marry again. Two years later, designated as &#145;Mr Charles Fortnum&#146;, he was appointed a page of the queen's presence chamber, the annual salary being slightly lower at &pound;40. He handed over his 75 per cent share of the grocery to his second son, Richard, then aged twenty-seven, John Mason owning the other 25 per cent. The <span class="italic">Court and City Register</span> shows him, from 1810 onwards, as the queen's groom of the privy chamber, perhaps an honorary post to give him additional status.<br>
<br>The Napoleonic wars, especially after the opening of the peninsular campaign in 1808, yielded much business to the grocery, which was kept busy in sending foodstuffs to army officers and civilian officials overseas. The younger Fortnum and Mason worked hard to expand the firm, and about 1811 rebuilt the premises at 181&#150;3 Piccadilly, the design being copied from a mansion in Padua. Still in the queen's service, Charles Fortnum died early in 1815. His salary ceased on 5 April, and two days later his will was proved. He described himself as of St Giles parish, Reading, but the rate books mention only a Joseph Fortnum, and he was not buried in the town.<br>
