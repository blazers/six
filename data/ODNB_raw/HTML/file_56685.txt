<span class="headword">Thomason,  Ann Arabella</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Bella Thomasson]</span>  (1874&#150;1959), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born at 15 Walkin Lane, Nether Hallam, Yorkshire, the daughter of John Clark, steel smelter, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Foster. On 6 July 1896 she married, at the register office, Bolton, Lancashire, Stephen (Steve) Thomason (1874&#150;1951), an ironworks labourer, son of Stephen Thomason, forgeman. They had a son and a daughter. Her husband &#145;used to hawk kippers, and take sixpenny bets, and when they got enough money, to start big, they took that shop&#146;  (interview with Dean, 10). This was a fruit shop at 9 Great Moor Street in the centre of Bolton. The <span class="roman">Betting Houses Act</span> of 1853 made it unlawful for people to bet for cash on horse-races in premises away from racecourses. Despite this the Thomassons (as their name was widely spelt) used their shop as a betting house.<br>
<br>When they were raided by the police in 1905 and prosecuted, Stephen Thomasson faced seven charges and his wife one. At the police court hearings the defence &#145;asked the Justices to dismiss the woman even if she had been assisting her husband, arguing that she was under his coercion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bolton Journal and Guardian</span>, 23 June 1905). The bench fined Stephen Thomasson &pound;25 with costs but made no additional penalty on his wife. At the hearing her husband promised that there would be no more betting at any house of his. This promise was unfulfilled and the Thomassons became the best-known betting house proprietors in Bolton, despite a heavy fine of &pound;100 imposed in November 1924 for their fourth offence.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s the Thomassons installed a ticker tape machine in their back yard. This was a telegraphic device run by the Extel company and it conveyed information from racecourses to subscribers. The facility placed them ahead of all the other local bookies, who relied on the local newspapers for their knowledge. By this time their shop was ostensibly a tobacconist's. In 1938 it was noted as &#145;a large cigarette shop that doesn't sell any cigarettes; there are dummies in the window, and the counter inside is used only for passing bets over; everybody knows about this, including the police, since anybody can walk in&#146;  (Mass-Observation, 265).<br>
<br>During the Second World War racing was suspended but afterwards Bella Thomasson started up in business again. Her husband was ill and although she had a son (called Steve) she took another bookie, Albert Hampson, as a partner. He put the ticker tape in the shop and hired a miner who worked on shifts to read out over a microphone the details given. These included the results and the changes in the betting on each race, and so allowed Thomasson to take race-by-race bets throughout the afternoon. This was an innovation. In much of Britain illegal bookies took their bets on the streets for a couple of hours around midday, with the majority of punters (betters) choosing a number of horses and having multiple bets. Race-by-race facilities encouraged single betting, leading to a higher turnover and bigger profits. In effect, Thomasson and Hampson had a modern betting shop, one punter recalling that it &#145;was full of men backing horses&#146;  (Carl Chinn bookmaking letters, Bootham to Chinn, letter 1, 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>As with other illegal bookies it is likely that Thomasson paid certain police officers to turn a blind eye to her activities. Yet she adhered to a strong code of conduct, believing that the shop was no place for women, and only allowed them to bet before racing started. Thomasson was also well known for her honesty. One punter was in the merchant navy and was called away to sea before he could collect his winnings. Two years later he returned and she paid him his money. He described her as &#145;always immaculate, always in black&#146; with &#145;nice bit of jewels on, not too flashy, she was a plump lady, well-built, good mannered. Always spoke like a lady&#146;  (interview with Dean, 10). Despite her partner's involvement and her old age, the business was seen as &#145;Bella's&#146; although &#145;some also called it Steve Thomasson's&#146;  (Carl Chinn bookmaking letters, Green to Chinn, letter 4, 1). She died at 1153 Chorley Old Road, Bolton, Lancashire, on 11 November 1959.<br>
