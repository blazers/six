<span class="headword">Kelsall,  John</span>  (1683&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and diarist</span>, the son of John Kelsall (1650&#150;<i>c</i>.1684), a tailor and later proprietor of an ale house, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cragg (1660&#150;<i>c</i>.1685), was born at Hart Street, near Covent Garden, London, on 18 September 1683. His parents died soon after, and with Joseph, his brother, he was &#145;left fatherless and motherless among strangers, very few or none of our kindred living in the City, but Friends were careful over us&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., S.194/1). In May 1687 his grandmother took charge of the boys and settled them initially at Quernmore, near Lancaster. During 1687&#150;9 Kelsall was locally educated before attending Abbeystead School in 1690. After his grandmother's death in 1699 Kelsall lived with an uncle at Wiersdale, where he continued his education. In April 1700 he briefly taught at a Friends' school at Yelland, but felt he had insufficient appreciation of Quaker doctrines. After this Kelsall went to Lancaster, where he fell into &#145;many troubles, temptations and exercises&#146;  (ibid.), but from June 1700 he underwent a spiritual conversion which was assisted with his removal to Penketh School. He remained here until May 1701 before accepting a teaching post at Dolobran Friends' school, near Welshpool, Montgomeryshire. From 1704 Kelsall became a regular representative to the London yearly meeting, but was not impressed by what he saw as the &#145;many spacious works and curious contrivances of men. &hellip; Pride and vanity are very regent and the glory of this world hath blinded the eyes of many&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On 3 May 1711 Kelsall married Susannah (1688&#150;1767), the daughter of Amos Davies of Coed Cowryd, and between 1713 and 1733 they had ten children. From 1713 he lived in the Dolobran meeting-house, but it was a difficult time. The school numbers had significantly dropped, and he was forced to sell his stock and equipment. He also considered emigrating to Pennsylvania with other Friends, in spite of his earlier protestations concerning Friends leaving Wales. In late 1713 the Quaker industrialist Abraham Darby offered him the position of clerk at the Dolgyn ironworks near Dolgellau, Merioneth, but Kelsall found that he could not be &#145;easie in my mind to be too hard and screwing with people in bargaining or agreements&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., S.194/1). Later in 1719 he was dismissed by the works' new owner, Samuel Milner of Bewdley, but was appointed in April 1720 to a similar position at Dolobran by Charles Lloyd. After Lloyd was declared bankrupt Kelsall returned as clerk at the Dolgyn furnace under the Paytons of Dudley, where he remained until the works closed in 1734. During the next year Kelsall taught at Welshpool, but by June 1735, in an impoverished condition, he was forced to seek employment as a teacher in Cork, from where he returned in February of the following year. After another spell in Dublin, Kelsall accepted a teaching post in Chester before moving to Boughton in January 1740. From then until his death in 1743 he sought work wherever he could find it, but his poor health increasingly assisted his fall into poverty.<br>
<br>Kelsall's diaries, now held at the Religious Society of Friends Library in London, provide insight into the hardships faced by, and lifestyle of, eighteenth-century Quakers in north-west England and Wales. While working for Charles Lloyd at Dolobran, for example, Kelsall commented on his disputes with non-Quakers and the difficulties faced by his employers and his family. Elsewhere, he recorded the numerous visitors to the Dolobran meeting, among them Quaker ministers from Pennsylvania. His religious beliefs were also expressed in his diaries, letters, and in the local meeting minutes. In 1705 he warned members about sleeping in meetings, while in April 1731 he complained that Friends &#145;unwilling to give &hellip; offence&#146; were not testifying against the &#145;lifeless superstitious ministry of the Priests&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., S.194/1). Kelsall may have also foreseen the rise of Methodism; it was, he wrote,<blockquote>my belief God will raise in due time a people out of Friends or others who will be commissioned to strike at the Root and Branch of Antichrist without Regard to the Frowns or Favours of High or Low Clergy or others. (ibid.)</blockquote>Apart from his journals Kelsall also engaged in a sizeable correspondence and compiled two volumes of unpublished poetry. In 1726 his <span class="italic">The Faithful Monitor, or, An Earnest Exhortation to Sobriety and Holiness</span> was published. In June 1737 he penned &#145;An alarm sounded to the sinners in Sion and all such as hold the truth in unrighteousness&#146; and a &#145;List of such publick Friends and some others that I have known and had acquaintance withal since the year 1700&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., S.191, 23 May 1736). These brief papers, however, were not published. Kelsall died on 1 August 1743 at Boughton, and was buried two days later at Newton, Cheshire.<br>
