</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Orpen, Sir  William Newenham Montague</span>  (1878&#150;1931), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 27 November 1878 at Oriel, Blackrock, co. Dublin, the fifth and youngest child of Arthur Herbert Orpen, a solicitor, and Anne Caulfeild, a member of the earl of Charlemont's family. Orpen's grandfather Sir Richard Orpen had been knighted for services to the legal profession and had established a successful legal practice which became the family firm. The home in Blackrock was comfortable; Orpen's childhood there was happy, and he wrote about it in <span class="italic">Stories of Old Ireland and Myself</span> (1924) with warm affection and not without a hint of nostalgia, indicating that subsequently his personal life proved less satisfactory, as was indeed the case.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Orpen's own interest in painting, demonstrated from an early age, was indulged by his mother, who supported his wish to go to art school against her husband's desire that he should study law and enter the family firm. Orpen entered the Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, in 1891 at the age of thirteen and showed exceptional talent from the very beginning. Large and well run, the school had benefited from reforms in art teaching in the second half of the nineteenth century, and was linked to the South Kensington schools of art. The headmaster, James Brenan, recognized Orpen's remarkable talent early on, and encouraged him. During his years at the school Orpen won every major prize, gold, silver, and bronze medals, scholarships, and an enduring reputation among his fellow students. In his last year he took the British Isles gold medal for life drawing, and then enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 1897.<br>
<br>Orpen enjoyed similar success at the Slade, where he was taught by Frederick Brown, Henry Tonks, and Philip Wilson Steer. Among his fellow students were Augustus John, Spencer Gore, Michel Salaman, Edna Waugh, Herbert Everett, the marine artist, and his mother, the eccentric Augusta Everett, and Orpen lived among a bohemian colony in Fitzroy Street which included John, who was probably closer to him than the others. Tonks in particular put his students under considerable pressure, made them look at great draughtsmanship, and master it as the basis for art. Tonks's exceptional talent as a draughtsman impressed Orpen, who with a brilliant student's ability to imitate and learn produced a number of wonderful early drawings (priv. coll.) with echoes in them of the old masters. Tonks encouraged his students to study old masters, including Chardin, Watteau, and Rembrandt, whose works were exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. Orpen combined his authority, as probably the finest draughtsman of his generation at the Slade, with a wry, mocking sense of humour which he softened by characterizing himself as an outsider. He was physically small and supposed himself ugly but had boundless ambition, almost to the point where it intimidated those closest to him. Orpen won prizes at the Slade, most notably the &pound;40 painting prize for <span class="italic">The Play Scene from &#145;Hamlet&#146;</span> (priv. coll.), and his success led others to turn to him for leadership and example. From his final year, 1899, he exhibited at the New English Art Club (NEAC), which shared the Slade's desire for realism in painting incorporating technical skill in paint, good draughtsmanship, and naturalness of subject. These values gave Orpen a clear sense of purpose and direction to which he applied himself with energy and an enormously rich and varied talent. His earliest oils, notably <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> (Tate collection), were acclaimed at the club's twice-yearly exhibitions, and Orpen forged a practice for himself as a portrait painter, earning enough from commissions to maintain himself. He moved in a group which included William and Albert Rothenstein (later Albert Rutherston), and through them he met the Knewstub sisters and their brother Jack. On 8 August 1901 he married Grace Knewstub, whose sister Alice had married William Rothenstein. They settled in a house in Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea.<h2>
<a name="Professionalbeginnings"></a>Professional beginnings</h2>Orpen travelled quite widely in the British Isles, fulfilling portrait commissions. Twice yearly from 1902 onwards he spent short periods in Dublin, teaching at the Metropolitan School of Art, and seeing his family and former student friends. He became a friend of Hugh Lane, a distant cousin on his mother's side, who was then an art dealer and the promoter of a modern art gallery for Dublin. The two travelled together in Europe in the summer of 1904, arriving first in Paris, where Orpen witnessed Lane's purchase of several impressionist masterpieces and experienced French art, so different stylistically from the teaching he had received at the Slade. They went on to Madrid, where Orpen &#145;discovered&#146; Vel&aacute;zquez, visiting again and again the collection of his work in the Prado while Lane went off to buy more works of art.<br>
<br>The impact of Vel&aacute;zquez was profound. Before the Madrid trip Orpen had displayed enormous versatility. The great Spanish master focused his mind on economy in painting, and on the simple, grand gesture which produces drama from depiction of realistic and everyday subjects. His <span class="italic">The Wash House</span> (NG Ire.), <span class="italic">The Idle Girl</span> (priv. coll.), and <span class="italic">Resting</span> (Ulster Museum, Belfast) from the series of paintings &#145;Lottie of Paradise Walk&#146; (others in National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and Leeds City Art Gallery) and his nudes of 1905&#150;7 attest to the impact of this encounter. So, too, do the portraits which Lane persuaded Orpen to paint of Irish figures from the period for his new modern art gallery in Dublin. These have the same bold simplicity of statement, and reflect a cultural revival in Ireland. They include paintings of the landscape painter Nathaniel Hone (1907) and the politician Timothy Healy (both Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin).<br>
<br>Orpen himself remained detached. While he painted these subjects well, he did not become engaged in the slightly feverish determination to support the nationalist movement. Irish art schools and exhibitions in any case were less committed to the nationalism which inspired writers like W. B. Yeats and Augusta Gregory, another of Orpen's cousins. Orpen could be said to have sided with the more cynical view of events held by George Moore, an expressive, experienced, and caustic critic of cultural revolution. Orpen was more interested in the lighter side of Irish life, in sport and entertainment, gossip and drinking. Occasionally he expressed scepticism, as did Moore, about the very possibility of Ireland as an independent entity, either culturally or politically, and this remained his view. His constant self-examination, represented in a remarkable number of self-portraits&#151;probably more numerous than those by any other major figure in the British Isles of the last 200 years&#151;attests to his need to understand himself through the only &#145;language&#146; which gave him meaning, paint. Nevertheless, in 1906 he began a major work, <span class="italic">Homage to Manet</span> (Manchester City Art Gallery), in which he attempted, in a conversation piece, to bring together in a group portrait the significant figures in British art at the time: Steer, Sickert, D. S. McColl, Moore, Lane, and Tonks. A parallel work, <span class="italic">The Selecting Jury of the N.E.A.C.</span>, known only in the form of a study (NPG) and showing the jury of the NEAC, turned into a caricature.<h2>
<a name="Earlysuccesses"></a>Early successes</h2>Orpen and Grace had a daughter, Mary, in 1902, and a second daughter, Kit, in 1906, and this meant that Grace spent more time at home in London, while Orpen, increasingly successful and gregarious, enjoyed himself away from home. Through his mother's interest in seeing him get on, Orpen was asked to paint a portrait of a wealthy American, Mrs Evelyn St George, who was married to another of Orpen's cousins, a land agent. The commission became a liaison, and Mrs St George an important influence; she encouraged Orpen to see himself as a great artist, and to paint appropriately. This advice resulted in a number of portraits, including the double portrait of his parents (NG Ire.; Arnold, 278), which she thought every great painter should attempt, and portraits of herself, large and dramatic treatments of a larger-than-life woman. (See, for example, <span class="italic">Mrs St George</span>, priv. coll.; Arnold, facing p. 256, plate 12.) Orpen now moved on from genre scenes, and small, intimate portraits in the Dutch manner, to a cycle of commissions from landowners and titled figures in British society. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1904, and regularly from 1908 until his death in 1931, showing over 100 works, mainly portraits. He became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1910, and the following year was a founder member of the National Portrait Society. He became a Royal Academician in 1919. He also exhibited with the Society of Portrait Painters and in a number of international exhibitions, including those which promoted Irish art.<h2>
<a name="Irishness"></a>Irishness</h2>Orpen's involvement in Irish life was irregular, but through his friendship with Lane he contributed to the collection of portraits commissioned for the new Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin, painting Anthony McDonald and the provost of Trinity College, J. P. Mahaffy, and remained supportive of Lane's efforts to make the visual arts part of the Irish cultural revival. Even so, he continued to feel ill at ease with the portentousness of much of the activity surrounding W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, preferring the irreverence of men like the Dublin throat surgeon Oliver St John Gogarty. Most of all he enjoyed the company of students, notably several future Irish painters of distinction, Sean Keating, Patrick Tuohy, Beatrice Elvery, and James Sleator. Two of these, Sleator and Keating, worked as Orpen's studio assistants as his portrait practice grew. Orpen's increasing unease with his Irishness is reflected in three allegorical works painted in 1913&#150;16, <span class="italic">Sowing New Seed</span> (Mildura Art Centre, Victoria, Australia), <span class="italic">The Western Wedding</span> (1914; Arnold, 292), and <span class="italic">The Holy Well</span> (1915; NG Ire.), which seek to show the country and its people in terms of religious, moral, social, and economic circumstances. Stylistically innovative, and using a tempera technique on large canvases, they failed, however, to capture the developing nationalism in art and culture, and Orpen made no further efforts to contribute to his country's identity, though he painted an outstanding portrait of his closest Irish associate and former student, Sean Keating, depicting him as <span class="italic">A Man of the West</span> (priv. coll.; Arnold, 164).<br>
<br>Orpen was rapidly becoming the most successful artist of his generation, taking the place in English portrait painting of John Singer Sargent, and arguably challenging Walter Sickert in the field of genre painting. His crowded professional life was matched by his vigorous and hedonistic private pursuit of pleasure and entertainment. The combination of the public and private realms of his life is expressed in the periodic interruption of his list of portrait sitters by individual genre works such as <span class="italic">The Caf&eacute; Royal</span> (1912; Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris), in which he brought together artists and writers he knew in a composite interior with figures. An inhabitant first of the Edwardian era, and then of the glittering era of power and prestige which preceded the First World War, he epitomized artistic and social success. A brief reconciliation with his wife, Grace, resulted in a third child, a daughter, Diana, born in 1914.<h2>
<a name="Warartist"></a>War artist</h2>With the coming of war, Orpen's life changed. He was slow to commit himself, but once the War Artists' Scheme was inaugurated, he saw a role for himself, and he characterized it in terms of repaying England for all it had done for him. He parted company with his Irish studio assistant, Sean Keating, who returned to conscription-free Ireland, and joined up as a war artist, being commissioned as a major. He left for France in April 1917, and for the next four years was totally immersed in the war and its aftermath. His output, and its overall excellence, makes him the outstanding war artist of that period, possibly the greatest war artist produced in Britain. Analysis of his war work, the major part of which is in the Imperial War Museum, London, shows a development in style and understanding, from the idealism which inspired him when he first arrived at the front to the disillusionment with the terrible ending to the war, and then the further dismay he and many felt at the direction taken by the peace deliberations. His paintings of the Somme battlefields are haunting recollections of anguish and chaos, of ruined landscapes baked in the summer sun, the torn ground white and rocky, the debris of the dead scattered and ignored.<br>
<br>With these works, all large and accomplished landscapes, are naturally grouped fine portraits of fighting men: officers and men in action, wounded figures haunting in their distress, German prisoners who are nevertheless noble in appearance and attitude, at odds with the war propaganda which Orpen was meant to support. His war portraits capture, in numerous variations, the expression of fear, shock, resignation, pride, and courage. In tandem with his work at the front, which had an immediacy reinforced by the artist's skill and his compassion, Orpen engaged in a series of formal portraits of the leaders such as Field Marshal Haig, Air Marshal Trenchard, and General Foch. Like many others, they sat to Orpen in the field of action, often breathless with the demands of their military duties, yet still acknowledging the demands of the military record.<br>
<br>Orpen's exhibition &#145;War&#146; at Thomas Agnews in Bond Street, London, in the spring of 1918 was followed by his gift to the British nation of all his war paintings. In that same year he received a knighthood. But public recognition left him increasingly isolated and sad about the tragedy he had witnessed and recorded. His last war paintings, such as <span class="italic">The Mad Woman of Douai</span> (IWM), <span class="italic">Bombfire in Picardy</span>, and <span class="italic">The Harvest</span>, convey the stress and anguish he certainly felt about the war and its aftermath. With the end of war he was free to leave but instead remained in France, painting portraits and scenes of the peace conference in Paris and Versailles. One, a highly contentious tribute, <span class="italic">To the Unknown British Soldier in France</span> (IWM), includes a flag-draped coffin with two shell-shocked soldiers flanking it. Under pressure, he painted out the soldiers, their shadowy forms remaining as ghostly <i>pentimento</i>.<br>
<br>Orpen wrote vividly of his experiences in <span class="italic">An Onlooker in France</span> (1921), an irreverent account of his life at the front that included moving tributes to the British soldiers and airmen who had been his companions and the subjects of his paintings. His outspokenness became controversial. His standing as a painter gave him the ear of many people in power, and he took risks, confronting what he saw as foolishness. This made him unpopular, though he survived it well enough. He also invented the persona of a mysterious and beautiful woman spy, portrayed in a number of paintings he did of the French woman he loved, Yvonne Aubicq. British officialdom took a poor view of this, but Orpen survived on the strength of his contacts. His own personality had developed with the war; his early idealism became a form of sombre realistic recognition of the terrible path of war through the lives of a whole generation. He came to love the fighting man, and to despise the politicians, with their glib words and their self-interested carve-up of Europe which was subsequently to prove so disastrous.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>During the immediate post-war period Orpen had a studio in Paris as well as in London. Through the intervention of her father, Mrs St George ended their relationship during the war; by then, Orpen had met Yvonne Aubicq. He travelled regularly between the two cities, and spent time in coastal resorts like Dieppe, to which he was frequently driven in his chauffeured Rolls-Royce, Yvonne beside him. To some extent he lost his way, and in the early 1920s he drank heavily, but this did not interfere with his portrait-painting practice, which was prodigious in scope and earned him a huge income, often as much as &pound;45,000 a year in the mid-1920s. Some of this work was inevitably superficial; he did not become involved with his sitters, as he had done before the war. He painted two ravishing nudes of Yvonne, <span class="italic">The Disappointing Letter</span> (1921; J. B. Speed Art Museum, Kentucky) and <span class="italic">Early Morning</span> (priv. coll.; Arnold, facing p. 353, plate 18), and a powerful diploma work for the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">The chef de l'H&ocirc;tel Chatham, Paris</span> (RA). This picture clearly did not qualify (as Orpen initially hoped) for acquisition for the nation under the terms of the Chantrey bequest, which requires that works submitted under the scheme to the Royal Academy have to be painted within Great Britain. Orpen treated quite mischievously the obvious fact that the work was painted largely in Paris, and it led to a rancorous controversy.<br>
<br>Orpen was the titular editor of <span class="italic">An Outline of Art</span> (1923), a large and prodigiously illustrated history of art, and in 1924 published his second book, <span class="italic">Stories of Old Ireland and Myself</span>. In this mocking and regretful account he seems to be looking for an alternative to the mixture of success and ill health which shaped his existence in his final years. He had a huge and splendid studio in The Boltons, south-west London, but his friendships were made among drinking companions and the many people who sought to benefit from his wealth. Owing to a sense of shame he felt at his physical decline his children had difficulty in getting to see him. And his peers, some of whom had been envious of his success, were now indifferent towards him. Orpen's death, from liver and heart failure on 29 September 1931 at 2 Clareville Grove, South Kensington, was followed by a small tribute exhibition in the Royal Academy. He was buried at Putney cemetery.<br>
