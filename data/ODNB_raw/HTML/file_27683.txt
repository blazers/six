<span class="headword">Tregonwell, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1498&#150;1565), <span class="occ">lawyer and ecclesiastical administrator</span>, may have been born of yeoman stock at Tregonnell in the parish of Manaccan in Cornwall; he had a sister, Alice, who married John Southcote. His first wife's maiden name was Kelway; his second wife, Elizabeth Martin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bruce (<i>d</i>. 1581/2), bore him a son, Thomas, and other children, who all appear to have predeceased him. Tregonwell may have been educated at Crantock College, Cornwall. He certainly attended Broadgates Hall, Oxford, obtaining his BCL on 30 June 1516 and his DCL on 21 July 1522. Before about 1527 he was principal of Vine Hall, Oxford, also known as Peckwaters Inn. Tregonwell practised at the court of arches, being admitted to the College of Advocates on 9 December 1522. By 1527 he is identified as a judge of the admiralty.<br>
<br>Evidently Tregonwell demonstrated considerable legal skill because in 1529 King Henry VIII &#145;called him from the Arches&#146; to assist in the royal divorce from Katherine of Aragon  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 14/2, appendix 35). Tregonwell appeared as one of the king's proctors at the hearing before Cardinal Campeggi at Blackfriars in June 1529, and in 1530 accompanied Thomas Cranmer and others to dispute the validity of the king's marriage abroad. As a master of chancery, Tregonwell appeared on behalf of the king on 5 April 1533, demanding that the convocation of Canterbury came to a conclusion regarding the king's divorce. On 8 May 1533 he accompanied Cranmer and others to Dunstable as a councillor in law &#145;for the King's part&#146; and on 23 May 1533 was present when Cranmer declared the king's marriage as &#145;against the law of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 6, nos. 661, 525). As a reward for his part in these events he obtained a &pound;40 annuity for life.<br>
<br>Tregonwell was also involved in diplomatic negotiations. In April and May 1532 he accompanied William Knight, archdeacon of Richmond, and John Hackett to Burborough, where mercantile grievances between the Merchant Adventurers and the Netherlands were discussed. In 1534 he was appointed a commissioner in the two treaties of peace with Scotland which he also signed; in the commission he is described as the principal judge of the admiralty. In October 1545 he was appointed, along with Tunstal and Paget, to treat with King Fran&ccedil;ois I of France  for peace. Illness prevented him from being appointed an ambassador to Flanders in 1546. His status with the king is reflected in his appointment as one of the council remaining at Westminster during Henry's discussions with Fran&ccedil;ois at the end of 1532. However, a setback in Tregonwell's career is revealed in May 1534 when, in a letter to Thomas Cromwell, he states that Cromwell had &#145;announced that the King has granted me master of the rolls&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 7, no. 743); in the event Cromwell obtained the position when it fell vacant in October 1534.<br>
<br>Tregonwell is best-known for his role as monastic visitor and commissioner. In a draft commission for the visitation of the entire English ecclesiastical establishment, dated either the end of November or early December 1534, Tregonwell is named as one of the three vicegerents. However, in January 1535 Cromwell became vicar-general and Tregonwell later was commissioned as a monastic visitor. He is first clearly identified accompanying Richard Layton at the visitation of Oxford University in the second week of September, issuing injunctions &#145;for the increase of learning there&#146; and ensuring that every scholar took the oath of supremacy  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 9, no. 351). After Oxford, Tregonwell parted from Layton and continued the visitation in the southern part of Lincolnshire diocese. By 9 November he had visited Athelney, Cleeve, and other Somerset houses and was about to enter Devon. In the monastic visitation he is last identified in early January 1536 at Salisbury Cathedral. Later in the summer he was probably involved with suppressing smaller houses in the west country. In November 1536 Tregonwell, along with Bedyll and Petre, were commissioned to receive from ecclesiastical institutions the bulls, briefs, and faculties previously issued by the papacy.<br>
<br>Early in 1538 Tregonwell had a commission for dissolving certain greater abbeys, including Abingdon. The pressure on abbeys to surrender increased at the end of 1538 and in December he was sent to Shaftesbury Abbey to encourage its submission. From January to March 1539 he was engaged in taking large numbers of monastic surrenders in the south-west and confirming pension arrangements for the redundant religious. In April 1539 he was one of three canon-law experts appointed by the king and Cromwell to frame the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>. From November 1539 to January 1540 he was principally in Lincolnshire diocese during the final tranche of surrenders and dissolutions.<br>
<br>Tregonwell complained to Cromwell in August 1539 that he had been &#145;a long suitor&#146; for monastic spoils but &#145;nothing would fall to my lot&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 14/2, appendix 35). He had in 1536 pleaded with Cromwell for the lease of a monastic house &#145;whereby he may have some help toward his living and funding of his wife and children&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 10, no. 388). On 23 February 1540 Tregonwell and his nephew John Southcote were granted in fee simple for &pound;1000 the house, site, and lands of the Benedictine abbey of Milton Abbas, Dorset, which a year previously he had suppressed.<br>
<br>Tregonwell was involved with other key events in King Henry's reign. In the first half of 1535 he was present when two Carthusian priests and Sir Thomas More were questioned for rejecting the king's supreme headship of the church. In May 1536 he participated in the proceedings against Anne Boleyn. After the northern risings of 1536&#150;7 he was involved with examining the abbot of Barlings, the abbot of Jervaulx, George Lumley, and others. In the inquiry into the validity of the king's marriage to Anne of Cleves, Tregonwell was a member of the working party which, in July 1540, pronounced its nullity. He was often given legal commissions by the privy council: in 1541, for example, he was sent to Plymouth to untangle the legal complexity of the wreck of a Portuguese ship. However, the summit of his legal skill is reflected in a commission to determine matters in chancery in the absence of the lord chancellor, dated October 1544; in 1547, 1550, and 1555 he had similar commissions. He was also a receiver of petitions to the House of Lords at parliaments in 1536, 1539, and 1541.<br>
<br>During Edward VI's reign, Tregonwell was still active in legal affairs and as a justice of the peace in Dorset. His name appears on a shortlist of three from which the sheriff of Dorset and Somerset was pricked. His career appears to have been revitalized in Mary's reign: on her accession he was one of the first to be knighted (on 2 October 1553), he was MP for Scarborough in her first parliament, a member of the commission examining Bishop Bonner's appeal against deprivation in Edward's reign, sheriff of Dorset and Somerset in 1554, and a House of Lords receiver of petitions in four parliaments. In February 1554 he was sworn one of the king and queen's council. Tregonwell's social position is exemplified by the licence he received to retain thirty gentlemen or yeomen in his household.<br>
<br>It is probably Tregonwell's conservative religious sympathies that account for his absence from important office after Elizabeth's accession, although he continued as a justice of the peace in Dorset. He made his will in December 1563, with an invocation for the prayers of the &#145;most glorious and blessed Virgin Mary&#146;, and, after apparently a lengthy illness, died at Milton Abbas on 13 January 1565, where he was buried in the old abbey church. His grandson John Tregonwell, son of his deceased son Thomas, was heir and had licence to enter the inheritance in July 1571.<br>
