<span class="headword">Gili,  Jonathan Francesc</span>  (1943&#150;2004), <span class="occ">documentary film-maker, publisher, and collector</span>, was born on 19 April 1943 at the Radcliffe Maternity Home, Oxford, the eldest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69795/', "Joan Lluis Gili (1907&#150;1998)")</script>, bookseller, publisher, and Catalan scholar, and his wife, Elizabeth Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McPherson (1913&#150;2011), who combined philosophy (in which she had a first-class degree) with cookery, on which she wrote two books. Long before their son went to school it was clear that he possessed unusual qualities. He taught himself to read at the age of three; and at four his favourite reading was Scholes's <span class="italic">Oxford Companion to Music</span>. He went to the Crescent School, then the Dragon School, in Oxford, and thence with a scholarship to Bryanston School in 1956. In 1961 he won an exhibition to New College, Oxford, to read Greats, but his studies were soon eclipsed by his interest in the cinema. He became <span class="italic">Isis</span> magazine's film editor, often watching five or six films a day. He graduated with a third-class degree in 1965. While still at Oxford he met Phillida Bovill Stone, daughter of the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31724/', "(Alan) Reynolds Stone")</script>, at one of Lord David Cecil's Sunday morning parties. He was eighteen, she sixteen, and for Gili it was love at first sight. They eventually married on 27 July 1968 and had three children, Oliver, Daisy, and Orlando.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford Gili worked briefly in his father's bookshop, but was determined to enter film-making. Edward Roberts gave him his first break as his assistant to edit Eddie Mirzoeff's BBC documentary <span class="italic">Jerusalem the Golden</span> (1968). His own first film as an editor was Barney Platts Mills's <span class="italic">Bronco Bullfrog</span> (1969). Through Mirzoeff, who first realized Gili's promise as a director, he edited other films for the BBC.<br>
<br>Gili's debut as a director came in 1971 with <span class="italic">Incident</span>, a short film starring Stephen Frears as a man progressively less concerned by a series of traffic accidents outside his window. But his forte was as a documentary film-maker. In 1978 London Weekend Television asked him to direct two films, <span class="italic">Wedding Day</span>, contrasting an Anglican with a Greek Orthodox wedding, and <span class="italic">Soldiers</span>, three cameos about the Salvation Army. This was a stroke of luck, for self-promotion was not one of Gili's talents. The following year Mirzoeff asked him to direct <span class="italic">Public School</span>, a film about Westminster School, which reached an audience of nearly twelve million. This was the turning point in Gili's career, and was the first of the many films he directed, wrote, and produced for the BBC, right up to his death. They were always films, not programmes (he never owned a television set). They were always about people, their hopes, quirks, interests, and loves, portrayed with a good humour never directed at the subject. This was as marked in <span class="italic">To the World's End</span> (1985), an exploration of London's multicultural society through the 31 bus route (with a score by Carl Davis), as in <span class="italic">The Other Half</span> (1984), about Angus Wilson and his partner, Tony Garrett.<br>
<br>Between 1985 and 1990 the BBC's <span class="roman">40 Minutes</span> series included several Gili films, among them <span class="italic">Mixed Blessings</span> (1988, about two babies accidentally swapped at birth), and three with Lucinda Lambton, <span class="italic">Animal Crackers</span> (1985), <span class="italic">A Cabinet of Curiosities</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">The Great North Road</span> (1988)&#151;a most happy partnership, skipping hilariously through various English eccentrics and eccentricities including those of the presenter herself. Presenters usually got in the way, he felt, unless their characters were part of the film, as in the first episode of <span class="italic">Fire in the Blood</span> (1992), in which the writer Ian Gibson explored his relationship with Spain, his adoptive country. Gili's subsequent films for Laurence Rees's <span class="roman">Timewatch</span> series included <span class="italic">Typhoid Mary</span> (1994), <span class="italic">Gold Rush Memories</span> (1996), <span class="italic">Tales from the Oklahoma Land Runs</span> and <span class="italic">Tales of the Eiffel Tower</span> (both 1999), <span class="italic">The Empire State Story</span> and <span class="italic">Debutantes</span> (both 2001), and, best of all, <span class="italic">The Oklahoma Outlaw</span> (1998).<br>
<br>Gili's films were beautifully shot. An outstanding photographer himself, he used natural light as far as possible, and was prepared to wait days if necessary for the right weather conditions. As well as the lighting, the angles of the shots would convey the emotion behind the story he was filming. He also used archive footage and stills to punctuate his films. Sound was as important. For him the &#145;voice&#146; in a film gave the overall tone, and could make or ruin it. Actors produced outstanding performances for Gili, and relished working for him. Music mattered too, as in his use of the slow movement of Ravel's piano concerto over lyrical shots of rusting farm machinery abandoned in the meadows in <span class="italic">Year of the French</span> (1982). Twice Gili was able to commission music, from Stephen Oliver <span class="italic">Cinderella, or, The Vindication of Sloth</span> (his last work) in <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Sins</span> (1993), and from Jonathan Dove the music for <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother</span> (2002).<br>
<br>Gili's interviewing technique was unique. He took great risks, never giving his subjects a script, nor a hint of the questions he was going to ask. During the interview itself he usually kept silent, merely prompting, never interrupting, however long the silences might be. Sometimes they were very long indeed. &#145;I like to see people thinking&#146;, he once said  (personal knowledge). Kind and humorous, he avoided filming people he disliked. He needed to feel affection for his subjects, even if he was exacting and ruthless in the interests of the film. Editors, cameramen, sound recordists, assistant producers, researchers, and personal assistants were driven mad by the demands that he made, but beguiled by his acute intelligence and irresistible stories; he charmed them into submission, and always gave proper praise when the work was well done.<br>
<br>Parallel with Gili's career as a film-maker was his career as a publisher. He started <span class="roman">Warren Editions</span> with his future wife in 1967. He inherited a passionate interest in book design and typography from his father, as Phillida did from hers. The first <span class="roman">Warren Editions</span> book was a collection of his father-in-law's work. Other publications included work by Ian Beck, John Betjeman (the text written for Mirzoeff's <span class="italic">Metro-land</span>, with Glynn Boyd Harte's lithographs), Kenneth Clark, Harold Jones, John Nash, and Gwen Raverat. Gili's own photographs won prizes for the calendars he designed for the David Game Group. He also collected books, the poetry, prose and illustrated books of his own and earlier times filling every available surface in his house in Ifield Road, Kensington. Books, however, had to contend with other things. He collected sardine tins, 7 inch singles (11,000 of them, some odd: &#145;Who could resist records shaped like Elton John's hat or Barry Manilow's nose?&#146;, he wrote in <span class="italic">Harpers and Queen</span>), printed paper napkins, hotel sewing kits, toy plastic mobile phones, snowstorms, and a hundred other things that touched his aesthetic sense, whether or not they appealed to anyone else. Sometimes they did: his friend Glynn Boyd Harte made a set of lithographs of the sardine tins, the sole text &#145;Contents: Sardines&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1984 Gili was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, and given at most three years to live. In the event he lived for twenty years more, cramming his life with activity between periods of treatment in Hammersmith Hospital, his thick black hair diminishing more with each treatment. He had just finished three of the most difficult films of his career when he was admitted to hospital for the last time. <span class="italic">Historians of Genius</span> (2004) had no dialogue other than the original text of three great writers, Carlyle, Gibbon, and Macaulay, with a brief introduction by Simon Schama. Gili had (unexpectedly) been appointed OBE in 2003, and (adding to a raft of honours for particular films) early in 2004 the Grierson documentary awards committee created the trustees' award especially to mark his outstanding contribution to documentary film-making. He died of leukaemia at Hammersmith Hospital on 1 October 2004, and was buried a week later in the churchyard at Litton Cheney, Dorset, where he had been married. He was survived by Phillida and their three children. A memorial meeting was held at the Royal Geographical Society in London on 6 March 2005.<br>
