<span class="headword">Standish,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1509&#150;1570), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is said to have belonged to the family of Standish of Burgh, Lancashire, and to have been the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26231/', "Henry Standish")</script>, bishop of St Asaph. Admitted a scholar of Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1524 he graduated BA on 16 May 1528. On 16 June following, aged nineteen, he was appointed a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, becoming a fellow in 1530. He proceeded MA on 17 July 1531 and relinquished his fellowship. He was ordained priest at Lichfield on 24 February 1532 but thereafter gravitated to London. By 1538 he had become praelector in theology at Whittington College, also serving as a university preacher at Oxford that year. After Robert Barnes had been burnt for heresy in 1540, defending his protestant views at the stake, Standish published <span class="italic">A Lytle Treatise Against the Protestation of R Barnes at the Time of his Death</span>, which was answered by Miles Coverdale. Perhaps as a result of this literary effort Standish was admitted BTh at Oxford in 1540 or 1541 and incorporated DTh on 16 July 1542. On 3 December 1543 he was collated rector of St Andrew Undershaft in London and on 30 June 1544 vicar of Northall, Middlesex, at the hands of Edmund Bonner, bishop of London.<br>
<br>During the next five years Standish rapidly transferred his allegiance to the evangelical camp and accordingly prospered under Edward VI. He was appointed chaplain to the king in 1550 and on 12 July that year was presented by the crown to the eighth prebend in Worcester Cathedral, receiving licence in 1552 to retain it though non-resident. In March 1551, probably as a result of the government's drive at this time to promote protestant preaching in the north, he was presented to the rectory of Wigan, Lancashire, although it must be doubted that he was ever admitted. On 10 January 1553 he was instituted by Nicholas Ridley, first protestant bishop of London, to the archdeaconry of Colchester on the presentation of Sir Edward Norton. Later that year he was admitted rector of Medbourne, Leicestershire. By now he was married but nothing is known of his wife.<br>
<br>The chapter of St Paul's, even under Ridley, had remained notably conservative and Standish's position as one of its few married prebendaries left him extremely exposed after the accession of Mary in July 1553. Possibly for that reason his institution to the archdeaconry of Colchester was cancelled on 22 January 1554, six weeks before Mary ordered the deprivation of married priests. After she had done so Standish was deprived of his London living and of Northall, and probably also of his Worcester prebend, where his successor was installed in September 1554. If he had ever held the rectory of Wigan it was presumably likewise relinquished at this time.<br>
<br>Standish repaired the damage by repudiating his wife and, thus reconciled to the Marian regime, published in 1554 <span class="italic">A discourse wherin is debated whether it is expedient that the scripture should be in English for al men to read that wyll</span>, in which he assigned fifty reasons why it was not. Nearly half of them emphasize that making the <span class="roman">Bible</span> accessible to the laity undermined the established order. It gave rise to &#145;teachers in corners &amp; conventicles&#146;, encouraged women to engage in theological debate, and made servants &#145;stubborne, frowarde and disobedient&#146; towards their employers  (sigs. K3<i>r</i>, H7<i>r</i>). Standish finally advocated the burning of all English bibles and was accordingly denounced by John Bale.<br>
<br>Standish was collated by the restored Bonner to the rectory of Paglesham, Essex, on 19 November 1554 and in 1555 was admitted rector of Rodmarton, Gloucestershire. In 1556, apparently still in possession of Medbourne, he dedicated to Cardinal Pole <span class="italic">The Triall of the Supremacy wherein is Set Forth the Unitie of Christes Church</span>. On 21 October 1557 Bonner further collated Standish to the prebend of Ealdland in St Paul's and on 15 October 1558, having taken part during the summer in the heresy trial of the Lancastrian martyr Roger Holland, he was once again admitted archdeacon of Colchester. He was deprived of the latter on 23 October 1559, during Elizabeth's royal visitation, and had to relinquish Paglesham to the married priest he had supplanted. Yet he seems to have been allowed to keep his prebend and on 15 December 1560 was admitted rector of Evington, Leicestershire. His successor was collated to Ealdland, vacant by his death, on 31 March 1570.<br>
