<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wind,  Edgar Marcel</span>  (1900&#150;1971), <span class="occ">philosopher and art historian</span>, was born at 5 Passauerstrasse, Charlottenburg, Berlin, on 14 May 1900, one of two children of Maurice Delmar Wind (<i>d</i>. 1914), a well-to-do Argentinian merchant of Russian Jewish extraction who exported optical instruments to South America, and his Romanian wife, Laura Szilard (<i>d</i>. 1947). Wind grew up in a cosmopolitan and polyglot environment, attending the Kaiser Friedrich Schule in Charlottenburg (1906&#150;18), and also benefiting from his father's excellent library. In 1918 he commenced studies at the University of Berlin in classics, philosophy, and art history, supervised by Adolph Goldschmidt. The following year he attended the lectures of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in Freiburg, and those of Max Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, Julius von Schlosser, and Josef Strzygowski in Vienna. Unimpressed, however, with the &#145;reigning sovereigns&#146;, Wind turned to Hamburg University where he became Erwin Panofsky's first pupil, and engaged with the neo-Kantianism of Ernst Cassirer.<br>
<br>In his doctoral thesis of 1922 Wind rejected Romantic and formalist approaches to art which emphasized aesthetic response over historical analysis. He would later summarize his approach as one which demonstrated that the intellect aided, rather than thwarted, the imagination in producing great works of art: &#145;I have tried to develop a method of interpreting pictures which shows how ideas are translated into images, and images sustained by ideas&#146;  (application for a Guggenheim grant, 1950, Wind Archive, Department of Western Manuscripts, Bodl. Oxf.).<br>
<br>At the height of the German depression in 1924 Wind left for the United States. After briefly teaching French and mathematics in New York high schools, he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at the University of North Carolina, where he encountered and was profoundly influenced by the pragmatism of C. S. Peirce. From 1926 to 1934 he was married to Ruth Hatch. On his return to Hamburg in 1927 Wind met Aby Warburg, becoming his personal research assistant at the Bibliothek Warburg. Warburg's example had a decisive impact on Wind's development as a scholar, encouraging him to concentrate on significant historical detail and its creative transformation into cultural imagery. Warburg, in turn, was impressed by Wind, remarking &#145;Ich vergesse immer dass Sie ein geschulter Kunst-historiker sind. Sie haben es ja so nett mit dem Denken&#146; (&#145;I always forget that you are a trained art historian. You know how to think so nicely&#146;; Buschendorf, &#145;Auf dem Weg nach England&#146;, 85). In 1930, after Warburg's death, Wind delivered an important lecture entitled &#145;Warburg's concept of <i>Kulturwissenschaft</i>&#146; (reprinted in translation in the posthumous collection of essays <span class="italic">The Eloquence of Symbols</span>, 1983).<br>
<br>Wind became a <i>Privatdozent</i> at Hamburg University following the completion of his <i>Habilitationsschrift</i> of 1930, <span class="italic">Das Experiment und die Metaphysik</span> (translated as <span class="italic">Experiment and Metaphysics</span> [forthcoming]), in which he strove to recover Kantian notions of geometry, space, and time in the wake of twentieth-century physics. It was at this time that he produced his first major art historical work: a study associating the different portrait styles of Reynolds and Gainsborough with James Beattie, Edmund Burke, and Samuel Johnson on the one hand, and with David Hume on the other (<span class="italic">Humanit&auml;tsidee und heroisiertes Portr&auml;t in der englischen Kultur des 18. Jahrhunderts</span>, 1932, reprinted in translation in the posthumous collection <span class="italic">Hume and the Heroic Portrait</span>, 1986).<br>
<br>Wind was dismissed from his post at Hamburg shortly after Hitler's rise to power in 1933. Nazi antisemitism endangered the Bibliothek Warburg, and Wind played a decisive role in negotiating the transfer of Warburg's library to London. From 1934 he was deputy director of the Warburg Institute, and in 1937 became founding editor with Rudolf Wittkower of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Warburg Institute</span> in which he published his first iconographical studies of Renaissance works of art. In lectures given in London at this time he advanced interpretations of the works of Michelangelo and Raphael with which he was absorbed for the rest of his life. His studies on these subjects were posthumously published as <span class="italic">The Religious Symbolism of Michelangelo</span> [forthcoming] and <span class="italic">The Raphael Papers: on the &#145;School of Athens&#146;</span> [forthcoming].<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1939 Wind found himself on sabbatical leave in America, where he then unexpectedly remained. He lectured widely at American institutions&#151;the Pierpont Morgan Library, Yale University, the Frick Collection, and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where he applied his historical method to twentieth-century art. In 1940 he met Margaret, the daughter of the physicist G. A. Hermann Kellner; she became his research assistant, and they married in 1942. As his literary executor after 1971 she was the driving force behind the publication of his papers. Wind was lecturer at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University (1940&#150;42), professor of art at the University of Chicago (1942&#150;4), and then Neilson research professor at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1944.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Wind chose to remain at Smith as professor of philosophy and art, and he became an American citizen in 1948. At Smith he continued to develop his research into Renaissance art, publishing studies of the iconography of the Sistine ceiling (1947) and Giovanni Bellini's <span class="italic">Feast of the Gods</span> (1948). In 1952 he advanced a sophisticated interpretation of Leonardo da Vinci as a Heraclitan magus in a series of radio broadcasts for the BBC's Third Programme. He also engaged in contemporary debates about art and ideas during this period. A visit by Jean-Paul Sartre to Smith College in 1946 provoked an impassioned statement against existentialism as a revival of Heidegger's &#145;thoroughly evil&#146; philosophy in the journal <span class="italic">Polemic</span>. Wind's commitment to intellectual integrity was again demonstrated in 1953 when he organized and contributed to a symposium on art and morals, one consequence of which was the dedication to Wind of W. H. Auden's poem &#145;The truest poetry is the most feigning&#146;.<br>
<br>The idea of creating a chair in the history of art at Oxford University had been promoted for some time by scholars who had known Wind since the 1930s, including Richard Livingstone, Ernest Jacob, Maurice Bowra, and Isaiah Berlin. In 1954 Wind was invited to give the Chichele lectures at All Souls College and chose as his subject &#145;Art and scholarship under Julius II&#146;. When the chair was created in 1955 Wind was appointed to it, becoming a professorial fellow at Trinity College. He faced the difficult task of establishing a new discipline in an ancient institution. In order to promote a cultural historical approach to the study of art, as distinct from the curatorial interests of the Ashmolean Museum, he argued for the creation of a new department with its own research library. He amassed a noteworthy collection of books, including many early editions, which, together with his own personal library, subsequently became the Wind Reading Room in the Sackler Library.<br>
<br>It is, above all, as a brilliant and charismatic lecturer that Wind is remembered at Oxford. He spoke without notes, showing only one black and white slide at a time. The popularity of his lectures made it necessary for the Playhouse Theatre to be used as a venue; the long queues for his series of lectures on modern art were even reported in the <span class="italic">Oxford Times</span>. In his 1957 inaugural lecture, &#145;The fallacy of pure art&#146;, Wind argued that the art historian should make observations which are &#145;aesthetically relevant without being aesthetic observations&#146;  (manuscript draft, Wind Archive, Department of Western Manuscripts, Bodl. Oxf.). The list of subjects to which Wind applied this maxim in his regular lectures demonstrates the wide scope of his learning. In particular, he gave classes with other scholars to promote interdisciplinary research on subjects as diverse as Kant and Hegel, Manet and Mallarm&eacute;, Renaissance medals, and Renaissance poems and their visual counterparts (with Stuart Hampshire, Austin Gill, Humphry Sutherland, and John Sparrow).<br>
<br>It was while he was professor of the history of art at Oxford that Wind published the two works for which he is now best-known: <span class="italic">Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance</span> (1958; rev. edn, 1967) and <span class="italic">Art and Anarchy</span> (originally given as the 1960 BBC Reith lectures). The former is a brilliant scholarly work in which Wind elucidated the obscure neo-Platonic mysteries which inspired some of the greatest works of the Renaissance. Wind anticipated the criticism that he attributed to artists such as Botticelli a depth of learning which they never possessed. He argued that the historian has to be more erudite than the artists he studies because &#145;we no longer enjoy the advantages of Renaissance conversation&#146;  (E. M. Wind, <span class="italic">Pagan Mysteries</span>, 1967, 15). In <span class="italic">Art and Anarchy</span> he explored the causes and effects of the marginalization, mechanization, and mass distribution of art in contemporary society. He examined the polarities of &#145;art for art's sake&#146; and <i>art engag&eacute;</i>, deplored the dissociation of the artist from the educated and informed patron, the ever-widening gap among modern artists between imagination and learning, and the transformation of the work of art into an object of &#145;interest&#146;. All these trends, he argued, have served to tame the anarchic energies of art and dilute the imaginative forces of both artists and their audience.<br>
<br>Wind's presence was imposing, even magisterial: he dressed formally and spoke a very elegant English, tinged with a German accent. The high standards of scholarship which he maintained, and expected from others, could seem daunting; but those who came to him for advice, whether students, colleagues, or friends, were treated with kindness, patience, and understanding. He retired from the chair at Oxford in 1967. He had been suffering from leukaemia since 1965 but, despite ill health, continued to work on his book on Michelangelo's theological sources. A shorter work on Giorgione's <span class="italic">Tempesta</span> was published in 1969, offering an ingeniously simple explanation for the famously enigmatic work. Edgar Wind died in London on 12 September 1971, and was cremated in Oxford.<br>
