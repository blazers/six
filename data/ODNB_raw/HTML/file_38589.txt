<span class="headword">Hammond,  William John</span>  (1797<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1848), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in London between 1797 and 1799. A low comedian and singer, he first played on the London stage as Lopez in John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span> in around 1819. In July of that year he was recruited to a newly formed stock company then playing at Walton-on-Thames, and the following September he joined Thomas Trotter's company at the Theatre Royal, Worthing, before going on to John Brunton's company at Brighton. In 1820&#150;21 he alternated between the Haymarket Theatre and Penley's company, which was playing at Worthing, Windsor, and Coventry. After a brief spell at the Olympic, he was engaged by William Macready (father of the tragedian W. C. Macready) as a member of his company at Bristol. Between 1823 and 1826 he played the York circuit under the successive managements of Robert Mansel and Thomas Downe. During these first years of his career on the stage he achieved considerable popularity as Bob Acres in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and as Tony Lumpkin in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>.<br>
<br>From 1826 to 1829 Hammond and his wife, Jane Matilda, the daughter of Samuel Jerrold and a sister of the playwright Douglas Jerrold, were members of the company playing at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool. In 1829 Hammond entered a partnership to run the Liverpool Pantheon; he reopened it as the Liver Theatre and continued his association with it until 1836. In April 1830 he took over the York circuit, which then included the theatres royal at Hull and York and further theatres at Doncaster, Leeds, and Wakefield. His period of management was brief, but in terms of his reception and the stars he engaged it was second only to that of Tate Wilkinson. Among others, he brought Edmund Kean, Charles Mathews, Frederick Yates, and Madame Vestris to his theatres. None the less he relinquished all but the Doncaster theatre in 1832 when he failed to secure a reduction in his rents. He continued to provide an annual autumn season at Doncaster until 1839, and took on the lease of the Sheffield theatre at &pound;300 a year (exclusive of gas, water, and taxes) from 1833 to 1839.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, and initially in partnership with his brother-in-law Douglas Jerrold, Hammond became the proprietor of the Strand Theatre, London, which had been opened in 1831. Here, from 25 May 1836, he enjoyed his greatest successes, putting on comedies, farces, and burlesques, including <span class="italic">The Pickwickians</span> and <span class="italic">Sam Weller's Tour</span>, in both of which he created the part of Sam Weller, and burlesques of <span class="italic">Othello</span> and <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>. Disaster followed when he took on the management of Drury Lane from October 1839. Despite the patronage of Queen Victoria, who made her first public appearance after her marriage at the theatre, Hammond's management ended at the beginning of March 1840, when he was declared bankrupt with debts of &pound;8000.<br>
<br>After more than a year in prison, Hammond sought to revive his fortunes by starring with provincial companies, where he was enthusiastically received in his popular old parts. John Coleman observed that &#145;He had wigs of all kinds and costumes of every description, but he was always Hammond in another wig and another coat&#146;  (Coleman, 1.282). In 1842 he held a brief lease for the Liverpool Theatre Royal, and in 1846 he opened another Liverpool theatre as the Theatre Royal Adelphi. Unsuccessful there, he sailed for America in June 1848, but died in New York on 23 August from dysentery. His effects, put up for auction, included the scarlet frock coat he wore as Tony Lumpkin for his d&eacute;but at Niblo's Theatre, Astor Place, a variety of other costumes, a host of wigs, and the orchestral parts which singers were expected by custom to provide.<br>
