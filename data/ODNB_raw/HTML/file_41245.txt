<span class="headword">Praeger,  Robert Lloyd</span>  (1865&#150;1953), <span class="occ">naturalist and author</span>, was born on 25 August 1865 at The Crescent, Holywood, co. Down, the second of the six children of Willem Emil Praeger (<i>d</i>. 1884), linen merchant, and his wife, Maria, daughter of Robert Patterson. Praeger's father was of Dutch extraction and had emigrated to Belfast in 1860 to set up a linen exporting business, in partnership with his brother in The Hague. His maternal family, the Pattersons, were prosperous Belfast dissenters with many interests in the fields of antiquities, art, local history, and natural history. In 1868 the Praegers moved to Woodburn House, Croft Road, Holywood, a newly built semi-detached villa. Next door was Croft House, a large house owned by Robert's maternal uncle Robert Lloyd Patterson (1836&#150;1906), himself an avid naturalist. Robert, or Robin, enjoyed extra-curricular tuition in natural history so that by the age of six, he later claimed, he could identify the quartz, feldspar, and mica in a specimen of granite from the Mourne Mountains  (Praeger, <span class="italic">The Way</span>, 8). Early membership of the Belfast Naturalists' field club brought him into contact with other amateur naturalists from his area and provided opportunities for wider exploration in the north-east of Ireland.<br>
<br>Following his early education at Sullivan Lower School, Holywood, Praeger attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution (1876&#150;1882) before proceeding to Queen's College, Belfast, where he graduated BA (1885) and BEng. (1886). His first employment was as an engineer working on the enlargements to Belfast harbour between 1886 and 1888; this gave him an opportunity to study fossil shells in the estuarine clays and stimulated a lifelong interest in Quaternary history. At this period he also conducted botanical research on the ferns of Ulster with William H. Phillips and the flowers of the Mourne Mountains with Samuel Alexander Stewart.<br>
<br>In 1888 Praeger passed up the opportunity of a permanent contract in engineering and began to cast around for an alternative which would allow him to devote his main energies to natural history. He eventually secured a position in 1893 as a librarian at the National Library in Dublin, where he worked until 1923. This was the beginning of a prolific period of fieldwork, publishing, and organizing of scientific societies. The establishment of a monthly journal, <span class="italic">The Irish Naturalist</span>, by Praeger and George Herbert Carpenter in 1892 provided the natural history movement with an outlet for regular publication of sightings, finds, and distributional papers. In 1895 Praeger launched the Irish Field Club Union, uniting all the field clubs in Ireland, in order to co-ordinate fieldwork and to report on progress in the different branches of natural history. Praeger's energies, as well as his indifference to bad weather and physical discomfort, were now famous in field club circles: a friend celebrated his calf muscles to contemporaries as &#145;one of the seven wonders of Dublin&#146;  (Aleyn Reade to Praeger, 1 May 1941, Praeger Collection, 10:77); on a trip to Fermanagh in 1904, when three-and-a-half out of five days rained, he decided &#145;not to mind it; so I put in an average of twelve hours' field work each day, and every evening returned, dripping but happy&#146;  (&#145;Among the Fermanagh Hills&#146;, <span class="italic">The Irish Naturalist</span>, 13, 1904, 232).<br>
<br>While Praeger continued with research into estuarine clays and glacial deposits, botany and Irish plant distribution became his major interest. His <span class="italic">Irish Topographical Botany</span> appeared in 1901 following a marathon programme of summer fieldwork lasting five years. He subsequently concentrated on the floral communities of Irish islands and organized a multidisciplinary survey of Lambay Island, co. Dublin, in 1907. The results of this survey included ninety additions to the Irish flora and fauna, including seventeen new British species and five which were new to science. These findings prompted the Royal Irish Academy, where Praeger was already an influential member, to sponsor a larger survey of Clare Island in Clew Bay, co. Mayo. When it finally appeared under Praeger's editorship the Clare Island survey (1911&#150;15) listed 3219 plant species and 5269 animal species of which 11 and 109, respectively, were new to science. Despite these findings the survey failed in its stated aim to demonstrate endemism on Clare Island.<br>
<br>On a holiday visit to Germany in 1901 Praeger met Hedwig (Hedi), daughter of the artist Christian Carl Magnussen. They were married the following year and set up home at Lisnamae, Zion Road, in Rathgar, a prosperous Dublin suburb. The Praegers had no children, but theirs was a companionate marriage, with Hedwig accompanying her husband on many of his travels; accordingly he dedicated his 1937 masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Way that I Went</span>, to her, his &#145;dear companion in many wanderings&#146;.<br>
<br>The move to Rathgar also marked the beginning of Praeger's work as a gardener and a specialist in succulents. The garden at his new home provided him with the opportunity of growing many native and exotic species, and here he took a special interest in houseleeks (<i>Sempervivum</i>) and stonecrops (<i>Sedum</i>). His cultivated collection of stonecrops eventually numbered 1500 specimens and formed the basis of his taxonomic study of the genus <i>Sedum</i>, published by the Royal Horticultural Society of London in 1921. This sedentary pursuit was suited to a period of war and upheaval in both Ireland and Europe with the restrictions placed on fieldwork.<br>
<br>In 1923, following the creation of the Irish Free State, Praeger retired from his position as head librarian at the National Library and was free to pursue botanical fieldwork full time. During the 1920s Praeger and his wife made several visits to the Alps, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Balkans for a second taxonomic study, <span class="italic">An Account of the Sempervivum Group</span> (1932). This taxonomic work earned him an international reputation as a botanist.<br>
<br>Having published several sketches of his foreign travels in periodical and then in book form (<span class="italic">Beyond Soundings</span>, 1930), Praeger discovered a facility for impressionistic prose. He committed this talent to a topographical survey of Ireland, <span class="italic">The Way that I Went</span> (1937), based largely on personal experience; this is the book by which Praeger is known to a general readership. His findings on Irish plant distribution and habitat types culminated in <span class="italic">The Botanist in Ireland</span> (1934); he also published a further volume of reminiscences, <span class="italic">A Populous Solitude</span> (1941), a biographical dictionary, <span class="italic">Some Irish Naturalists</span> (1949), and a <span class="italic">Natural History of Ireland</span> (1950).<br>
<br>During Praeger's retirement he and his wife lived at 19 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, where they had moved in 1922. The central location suited the Praegers, who were never car owners, as it afforded quick access to the museums, libraries, and other institutions with which Praeger had connections. In later life Praeger enjoyed many honours for his contributions to natural history, but the one which gratified him most was his election as president of the Royal Irish Academy in 1931. Twice president of the Dublin field club, he received the gold medal of the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland in 1940 and became its president in 1949&#150;50. He continued to enjoy vigorous physical health into the 1930s, working in a voluntary capacity as a gardener at the zoological gardens and continuing his fieldwork on Irish plant distribution. In his final years increasing deafness contributed to a brusqueness of manner while arthritis of the knee joints eventually reduced his mobility.<br>
<br>Following his wife's death in 1952 Praeger settled his affairs in Dublin and returned to the north-east of Ireland, where he spent his last months at his sister Rosamond's house, Rock Cottage, Craigavad, co. Down. He died at the Musgrave and Clark Clinic, Belfast, on 5 May 1953.<br>
