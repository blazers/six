<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Furlong,  Monica Mavis</span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">novelist and writer on religion</span>, was born on 17 January 1930 at 29 Kenton Park Avenue, Kenton, Middlesex, the younger daughter of Alfred Gordon Furlong (<i>c</i>.1889&#150;<i>c</i>.1970), a motor tyre salesman of Irish descent, and his wife, Bessie Winifred Esther (Freda), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simpson (1901&#150;1985). She attended Harrow county girls' school and left to take a secretarial course. Her family did not expect a girl to go to university. After secretarial jobs she was in demand as a journalist, writing for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (for Bernard Levin, who was to become a lifelong friend), <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, where she was on the staff from 1961 to 1968. During her time in secretarial work she was drawn to the Church of England and through her local vicar, Joost de Blank, later bishop of Stepney and archbishop of Cape Town, she learned an Anglo-Catholic form of Anglicanism. On 12 September 1953 she married William John Knights (<i>b</i>. 1922), the son of William John Knights; they had one son and one daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1977. This divorce, after twenty-four years of difficult marriage, was among the most painful experiences of her life; at that time divorce was seen as a terrible failure and disgrace for a Christian. In response to this she accepted a commission from the Mothers' Union to write a short book about the experience of divorce, a courageous act by herself and by the Mothers' Union.<br>
<br>From 1974 to 1978 Furlong was a producer in the religious department at the BBC, while continuing to write. Her work as a journalist (on both secular and religious affairs) brought her into contact with most of the events and issues of life at the time. On the religious side, she wrote a steady stream of books, including <span class="italic">With Love to the Church</span> (1965), reflecting her liberal understanding of prayer and spirituality, the more mystical <span class="italic">Travelling In</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">Contemplating Now</span> (1971), <span class="italic">God's a Good Man</span> (poems, 1974, reissued in <span class="italic">Prayers and Poems</span>, 2003), and <span class="italic">Christian Uncertainties</span> (1975). The first of her biographies was of John Bunyan, <span class="italic">Puritan's Progress</span> (1975), followed by <span class="italic">Merton</span> (1980), <span class="italic">Genuine Fake</span> (1986, on the guru Alan Watts, reissued in 2001 as <span class="italic">Zen Effects</span>), and <span class="italic">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux</span> (1987), in which she combined her spiritual interests and her feminist commitment. Her secular writing included four novels, which were highly praised, but did not become best-sellers: <span class="italic">The Cat's Eye</span> (1976), <span class="italic">Cousins</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Wise Child</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">A Year and a Day</span> (1990), the two last being novels for children, set in the seventh century. She also wrote a travel book, <span class="italic">Flight of the Kingfisher: a Journey among the Kukatja Aborigines</span> (1996).<br>
<br>As one of the leading Christian feminists of her time Furlong made an outstanding contribution in the political arena, in feminist thought and writing and in the area of worship and spirituality. She stood in the proud Anglican tradition of women theologians and writers such as Dorothy Sayers and Rose Macaulay. She shared with them a depth of catholic practice and original theological insight, a critical love for the church and willingness to challenge it, as well as a private life which did not conform to everything the hierarchy wanted to regard as respectable. But their fame eluded her, and she found it difficult to produce a regular and consistent series of novels which would gradually have built up a committed body of readers and laid the foundations for popular success.<br>
<br>After 1975 Furlong became a campaigner for the ordination of women, bringing to the task her wide friendships across the whole area of public and literary life. She was moderator of the Movement for the Ordination of Women from 1982 to 1985. In this role she ensured that the movement kept a cutting edge, did not compromise, and was not afraid of embarrassing the (male) bishops. Everything she did was founded on theological understanding, but her main ability was to work on several fronts at once. Her leadership of the St Hilda community (which worshipped in the East End of London on Sunday evenings) gave women a vision of what could be done in leading worship; those who imagined that worship was impossible unless a male priest celebrated the eucharist for them not only saw that the sky did not fall if a woman priest (from the United States) was the celebrant, but more importantly that, if male priests continued to keep the eucharist within their own power, then there were many non-eucharistic ways in which Christians could worship God. Meanwhile her knowledge of the media, and her contacts within it, alongside her ability to think strategically, made her a most effective politician. She knew how to present her cause to the media and how to avoid being silenced by the authorities in the church. Her refusal to be daunted was the chief memory of those who worked with her. She would not allow herself to become dependent on male approval, and knew that women too had much to offer the church and society. Many of her religious books reflected her concern for women's issues: they included <span class="italic">Feminine in the Church</span> (1984), <span class="italic">Mirror to the Church</span> (editor, 1988), <span class="italic">A Dangerous Delight</span> (1991), <span class="italic">Bird of Paradise</span> (memoir, 1995), and <span class="italic">Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics</span> (1996). Her last and most challenging book was <span class="italic">The C of E: the State It's In</span> (2000). Church leaders were not happy to face her criticism in this book, and yet it was seen by many readers as prophetic.<br>
<br>Furlong received honorary doctorates from Bristol University and from the General Theological Seminary of New York. After the ending of her marriage she continued to live in London, with a large and lively circle of friends. After some years of struggle with the church, which as an institution sometimes seemed not to return her love, she settled down in her last years to edit her local parish magazine and to campaign for the abolition of the act of synod that hedged the ordination of women as priests about with huge privileges for those who objected to it. She was delighted with the appointment of Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury. She died of ovarian cancer at the Round House, Hoe Farm, Umberleigh, Devon, where she spent her final days with her daughter's family, on 14 January 2003. She was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Cator Road, Beckenham, on 23 January. She was survived by both her children.<br>
