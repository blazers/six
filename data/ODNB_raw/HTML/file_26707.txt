<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stuart,  James</span>, fourth duke of Lennox and first duke of Richmond  (1612&#150;1655), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born at Blackfriars, London, on 6 April 1612, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67529/', "Esm&#233; Stuart, third duke of Lennox (1579?&#150;1624)")</script>, and Katherine Clifton (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1637). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26695/', "Lord Bernard Stuart")</script> was his younger brother. A cousin of James VI and I and of Charles I, he had a claim to the Scottish but not the English throne. King James was a sponsor at his baptism, and became his guardian at his father's death in 1624. Created an MA of the University of Cambridge by royal mandate in 1624, and in receipt of a royal pension of &pound;1400 a year, Lennox became a gentleman of the bedchamber in April 1625. Knighted in June 1630, he was created an English privy councillor on 28 July 1633 and a knight of the Garter the following November; during the summer of that same year he accompanied Charles I to his Scottish coronation.<br>
<br>Lennox married Lady Mary Villiers [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56054/', "Villiers, Mary, duchess of Lennox and Richmond")</script>], only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham")</script>, on 3 August 1637, and her &pound;20,000 dowry relieved him of financial worries until the mid-1640s. He was also appointed to several local English offices, notably lord lieutenant of Hampshire in May 1635, keeper of Richmond park in 1638, and lord warden of the Cinque Ports in June 1640. His Scottish lands were small and unprofitable, but he owned extensive estates in England. His country seat was at Cobham Hall in Kent, and he also possessed scattered lands in Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Lennox was deeply loyal to the crown: Clarendon later wrote of his &#145;unspotted fidelity&#146; and &#145;entire resignation of himself to the King&#146;  (Clarendon, 1.76, 2.528). In the autumn of 1637, when Lennox visited Scotland for his mother's funeral, the covenanters hoped that he would represent their case to the king, but Lennox's instinctive response to complaints about Caroline policy was the tactful assurance &#145;that the King was misinformed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.302). Although he apparently questioned the wisdom of war with the Scots, his loyalty to the crown was unshakeable. He opposed Strafford's attainder during the spring of 1641. That summer he accompanied Charles to Scotland, but was not permitted to sit in the Scottish parliament until he had taken the covenant. On 17 September he was named to the Scottish privy council. He was created duke of Richmond on 8 August 1641, and early the following December was appointed lord steward of the king's household.<br>
<br>Lennox's position in the Lords was fatally compromised on 26 January 1642, when he &#145;put the question whether we shall adjourn the Parliament for six months&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Private Journals of the Long Parliament</span>, ed. W. H. Coates, A. S. Young, and V. F. Snow, 3 vols., 1982&#150;92, 1.195). This provoked an outcry in both houses and some members of the Commons demanded his impeachment for threatening parliament's sitting. In the event, Lennox was required only to &#145;make an humble submission and acknowledgement&#146; that he had spoken &#145;inconsiderately and inadvisedly&#146;, although twenty-two peers (including Warwick, Essex, Wharton, Pembroke, and Brooke) protested that this was &#145;not a sufficient punishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4.543). On 2 February Lennox was given leave, and he never attended the Lords again. By April he had joined the king at Hull.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Lennox regularly acted as one of the king's commissioners in peace talks with the houses. In December 1644 he and the earl of Southampton acted as go-betweens in the negotiations that set up the treaty of Uxbridge. Lennox, together with the earls of Southampton, Hertford, and Lindsey, made a final desperate attempt to reach agreement with the parliamentarian army at Woodstock in April 1646, but this went wrong and led to his brief imprisonment in Warwick Castle. The committee for compounding assessed him at &pound;9810 on 15 December 1646; he compounded and received letters of discharge in May 1647. Lennox remained close to Charles I and he was among a select group of advisers whom the king summoned to attend him during the summer and autumn of 1647. Charles appointed him one of his commissioners at the treaty of Newport between September and December 1648. Lennox attended Charles during his trial and execution and was one of the royalist peers present at the king's funeral.<br>
<br>According to Sir Edward Walker, &#145;after the murther of the King, [Lennox] retyred unto his house at Cobham Hall in Kent, seldome ever appearing abroad&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1110, fol. 167<i>r</i>). He resolutely refused to get involved in any conspiracies against the republic, despite the approaches of several royalist activists. Although he had declined to assist the royalist campaigns of 1650&#150;51, he was summoned before the committee of examinations in May 1651. His request to be excused from taking the engagement reinforced the council of state's suspicions about his loyalties, and he was bailed on a bond for &pound;10,000, with two sureties for &pound;5000 each. The following October, he was again summoned before the council, but responded by sending a doctor's certificate affirming that he was too ill to attend. A further summons in December 1651 was again declined on grounds of ill health. His final years were dogged by illness, and according to Robert Baillie, by the summer of 1654 the duke was living in Kent as quietly &#145;as a man buried&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.249). Lennox died at Cobham Hall on 30 March 1655, and was buried on 18 April in Henry VII's chapel at Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Lennox's widow suffered growing hardship in the later 1650s: the timber at Cobham Hall was plundered for Cromwell's navy, and by 1658 the family had sold off most of its Scottish lands. She seems to have lived very quietly, and in the summer of 1658 moved to Paris where she spent the rest of the interregnum. She lived until November 1685, but their only son and heir, Esm&eacute;, fifth duke of Lennox and second duke of Richmond, died in Paris in 1660.<br>
