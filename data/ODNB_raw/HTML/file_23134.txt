<span class="headword">Rankins,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1565, <em>d.</em> in or after 1609), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was baptized on 24 November 1565 at St Gregory by Paul, London, the son of Henry Rankyn and Mary Robynson (<i>d</i>. 1584). Two years after his son's birth Henry was elected to the livery of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company, and he eventually became master of that company in 1587. During his lengthy career the elder Rankins seems to have earned a tidy sum. When he wrote his will in March 1597 he bequeathed to his elder son, William, &pound;160; however, he also stipulated expressly that William was to have nothing to do with the administration of the estate. In fact, Henry set up his will so that his younger son (also named Henry) would inherit most of the estate if William were to &#145;mislike or refuse to accept&#146; the bequest initially set forth in the will. (In retrospect, it would seem that William did indeed &#145;mislike&#146; the arrangements made by his father. Over time, and upon arrival at adulthood, William's younger brother collected most of what the estate was valued at, a portion of &pound;145.)<br>
<br>Such opposition seems to have been commonplace throughout Rankins's life. He began his literary career attacking plays in a polemic entitled <span class="italic">A mirrour of monsters: wherein is plainly described the manifold vices, and spotted enormities, that are caused by the infectious sight of plays</span> (1587). Also, early on, he published <span class="italic">My Roughcast Conceit of Hell</span> (n.d.) and a forceful denunciation of the Englishman's habit of imitating foreign fashions (<span class="italic">The English Ape</span>, 1588), both dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton.<br>
<br>Ten years later, however, Rankins had reversed his position on the theatre and was writing plays for the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose Playhouse. Philip Henslowe, the playhouse owner and company financier, paid Rankins for &#145;Mulmutius Dunwallow&#146; (October 1598), &#145;Hannibal and Scipio&#146; (January 1601), &#145;Scogan and Skelton&#146; (January&#150;March 1601), and &#145;The Conquest of Spain by John of Gaunt&#146; (March&#150;April 1601). The first play was apparently based on Raphael Holinshed's chronicles. (The last three were co-written with Richard Hathway, whose career as a playwright for the Admiral's Men produced at least eight other plays written between 1598 and 1602, including <span class="italic">1,2 Sir John Oldcastle</span>.) In addition, some theatre historians conjecture that Rankins was part-author of a play entitled <span class="italic">Leire</span> (entered into the Stationers' register in 1594) which was revived by the Queen's and Sussex's Men for Henslowe on 6 and 8 April 1594 shortly before the Stationers' entry.<br>
<br>In 1598 Rankins published <span class="italic">Seaven Satyres Applied to the Weeke, Including the Worlds Ridiculous Follyes</span>. Dedicated to his friend John Salisbury of Lleweni, esquire, the book stands as Rankins's last substantial work. The preface to John Bodenham's <span class="italic">Belvedere</span> (1600) contains but three short stanzas (&#145;A Sonnet to the Muses Garden&#146;) signed &#145;W. Rankins, Gent&#146;; and in 1604 he contributed some miscellaneous verses to the anonymous <span class="italic">Plato's Cap</span>. By this time Rankins's professional career had subsided. A note of ownership inscribed in a copy of Holinshed, dated 4 June 1609 and perhaps written by Rankins himself, is possibly the last mention of him while he lived. Throughout his life his output was steady; but he seems generally to have drawn little attention, although in 1598 Francis Meres mentioned Rankins in his <span class="italic">Paladis Tamia</span> (along with Joseph Hall and John Marston) as one of the three best satirists of his age.<br>
<br>A &#145;William Rankyns of Clifford's Inn, gent&#146;, who bound himself to appear at the Middlesex sessions on 15 September 1587 might, or might not be the writer. If he is synonymous with the author, then Rankins's literary career was launched, like those of so many contemporary writers, during his time at the inns of court.<br>
