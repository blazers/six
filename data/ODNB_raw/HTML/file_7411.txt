<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Critz,  John  de, the elder</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">serjeant-painter</span>, was a son of Troilus de Critz (<i>d</i>. 1582), a broker of Antwerp, and his wife, Sara (<i>d</i>. 1590), the daughter of Jacob van Meteren of Breda, a printer, and Ottilia Ortels, a relative of the cartographer Abraham Ortelius, whose family had moved to Antwerp from Augsburg. His parents were granted the right of denization in England in 1552, perhaps indicating that they had arrived somewhat earlier to establish their credentials. The only evidence about their family is in a few ambiguously worded aliens' returns of dubious accuracy&#151;probably because of language difficulties and misunderstandings between English assessors and foreign-born immigrants. The first return, dated 1568, lists Troilus and Sara and five children, Susan (Susanna), Oliver, John, Sara, and Magdalen, who must have been born in England. Returns of 1571 show that the sons were apprenticed, to an immigrant merchant and painter respectively, and lodged with them in the customary manner. John appears to have completed four years of his service with the immigrant painter Lucas de Heere in the parish of St Benet Fink. His parents, living in the parish of St Mary Staining, near Cripplegate, were now &#145;of the Englishe churche&#146;, not the Dutch&#151;thoroughly assimilated. Troilus was buried at St Andrew Undershaft in 1582 and Sara in 1590.<br>
<br>In the 1580s and 1590s ministers sometimes recruited foreign-born residents in London to revisit the continent as couriers of official letters. One was John de Critz, who in the 1580s enjoyed the patronage of Sir Francis Walsingham. In 1582 he was in Paris, and three letters from him to the secretary of state survive (quoted in <span class="italic">DNB</span> and Edmond, 47). In the third, dated 14 October, he says he is thinking of spending the winter in France and then, if Walsingham agrees, going on to Italy. It is not known whether he did so. That he was in Paris again several times between 1583 and 1588 is evident from fees noted in the accounts of the treasurer of the chamber. There is only one known portrait type of Walsingham (<i>d</i>. 1590), and de Critz may well have been responsible for the unsigned likenesses of his former patron. No signed portraits commonly attributed to de Critz survive: a few manuscripts show that he wrote his &#145;de&#146; with a small letter, not a capital as supposed hitherto.<br>
<br>Portraits of Robert Cecil also seem to be confined to one face pattern, with de Critz probably the &#145;purveyor&#146; or provider  (Strong, <span class="italic">Tudor and Jacobean Portraits</span>, 273&#150;5). Cecil was a small and slightly deformed man (Queen Elizabeth sometimes called him her &#145;elf&#146;). He was understandably sensitive about his appearance and ensured that only a carefully edited image was circulated. A bill of 1607 from de Critz to Cecil (since 1605 earl of Salisbury) includes a charge of &pound;4 each for &#145;making&#146; five &#145;pictures&#146;  (Cecil papers, Box U/81, Hatfield House, Hertfordshire). One was given to the constable of Castile, one was for Lady Elizabeth Guildford, one for Sir Henry Wotton, ambassador at Venice, and two were given to the French ambassador in London&#151;one of Cecil, the other of his father, Lord Burghley. It has been assumed that de Critz was producing &#145;his standard three-quarter length portrait of Robert Cecil&#146;, of which a version at Hatfield House measures 35 by 27 inches. Salisbury, approving payment in his fluent hand at the bottom, writes &#145;pay this byll so farr&#146;, implying that there were more to come: de Critz's signed receipt is dated 16 October. (Some orders from less exalted men may have been copies.)<br>
<br>For some time there had been much intermarrying within the protestant artistic community in London, immigrants &#145;for religion&#146; from France and the Spanish Netherlands. The complexities, as set out in Edmond, in particular in the pedigree, show the importance of the marriages of de Critz's sisters Susanna and Magdalen (which he probably promoted). In 1571 Susanna became the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10576/', "Marcus Gheeraerts the elder")</script>, a widower who had arrived from Bruges with his young son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10577/', "Marcus Gheeraerts the younger")</script>. The boy later became the most fashionable portrait painter of his day and in 1590 married de Critz's sister Magdalen, becoming his stepmother's brother-in-law. Marcus Gheeraerts the elder and Susanna had two surviving daughters&#151;here correctly identified as de Critz's nieces&#151;Sara, who became the second wife of the miniaturist Isaac Oliver in 1602 but died in 1605, and Susanna (called after her mother), who in 1604 was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5998/', "Maximilian Colt")</script>, a sculptor, of a French family from Arras. He and de Critz became close colleagues at court.<br>
<br>De Critz's main importance was as serjeant-painter, a court appointment to James I from his accession in 1603, and then to his son Charles I until his death in 1642. After the death of his predecessor, Leonard Fryer, in 1605, and the appointment of Robert Peake as portrait painter to the short-lived Prince Henry, heir to the throne, de Critz formally achieved his goal, becoming the sovereign's sole serjeant-painter for life. The word serjeant, as used in de Critz's case, then prefixed the titles of heads of some specific departments within the royal household. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries portrait painters were usually called picturemakers, or variants of this; the word painter was generally used for men who used paint to embellish surfaces of all objects, sizes, and descriptions, and often made of wood or stone. De Critz and his men worked, not only in London, embellishing objects from garden seats, royal barges, ships, and road vehicles to &#145;dials&#146; and interiors of palaces, the last involving much gilding and use of &#145;rich colours&#146;. Horace Walpole was surely right in concluding that de Critz's life could be better traced &#145;from office-books [the office of works accounts] than from his works or his reputation&#146; (Walpole, 2.15; see also Edmond, 162&#150;74). There he appears repeatedly but never as a painter in the sense of portrait painter.<br>
<br>In 1606 Colt and de Critz were given a commission of prime importance, to complete the great tomb of Elizabeth I in the Henry VII chapel at Westminster Abbey. Colt is presumed to have been recommended by Lord Salisbury, by whom he was employed at Hatfield House, and received an initial contract of &pound;600 for carving the stone (very much higher than supposed earlier) and further payments later, the work to be completed by 1607. De Critz received &pound;100 for painting the stonework. Nicholas Hilliard sought the stone-painting commission, but ruefully reported to Salisbury that de Critz had told him the task was his responsibility &#145;within the Patent&#146;&#151;as Hilliard put it  (letter, 1606, Hatfield House, CP 119/8). This supports the present assessment of the serjeant-painter's full-time court responsibilities. A fine full-length portrait of James I, shown at the Tate Gallery exhibition &#145;Dynasties&#146; (1995, catalogue no. 125), was there tentatively dated <i>c</i>.1606 and attributed to John de Critz. This would not have been within his patent, and attribution to the admired portrait painter Marcus Gheeraerts the younger would surely have been more appropriate (see Edmond, 137&#150;8).<br>
<br>John de Critz married three times and had sixteen children in all. His first wife, Helen Bower, was English and of a wealthy City family called Woodcock; dates and places of marriage and baptisms of the first four children are unknown&#151;the family was probably living in the parish of St Sepulchre without Newgate, of which early registers were lost in the great fire of London. From 1607 they appear in the neighbouring parish of St Andrew, Holborn, where they remained for thirty years, living at the north end of Shoe Lane, which links Holborn to Fleet Street. The last three baptisms were of Thomas (1607), <a href="#cosubject_7411">Emanuel [<i>see below</i>]</a> (1608), and a short-lived Elizabeth. Their English mother was buried on 4 April 1609, and on 14 May de Critz married a widow and mother of painters, Sara de Neve. She and John had four children. Sara died in 1618, and about 1621 de Critz married Grace Palmes of Hampshire (who was probably English) and fathered his last five children. In 1637 the family moved to the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, where de Critz, a wealthy man now &#145;sick and full of yeares&#146;, died in 1642 and his widow in 1648: both had expensive funerals and were buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields, John de Critz on 14 March 1642. His will opens with the resounding words &#145;I John Decretts Esquire Serjeant Paynter to our Soveraigne lord king Charles&#146;&#151;underlining his pride in his long-standing court appointment.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_7412"></a><span class="headword">John  de Critz the younger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1642<span class="mult">x</span>5)<span class="occ"></span> was the eldest son of John de Critz, who in 1610 had paid to ensure him the office of serjeant-painter after his own death. In fact the son never succeeded to the office: his father was buried on 14 March 1642 and he was sworn in four days later, but civil war broke out in August and he soon joined Charles I at Oxford and lost his life. He may have helped his father during his long career, but there is no substantial evidence of this.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_7411"></a><span class="headword">Emanuel  de Critz</span>  (1608&#150;1665)<span class="occ"></span> was the youngest son of John de Critz and his English first wife, Helen. At the restoration of Charles II in 1660 he was among the first to seek recompense for loss of royal earnings during the Commonwealth, but from the state papers it is clear that he never became serjeant-painter, although it is often assumed that he did. When Charles I's art treasures were dispersed in 1649&#150;51 he made strenuous but largely unsuccessful attempts to buy many of them. At some point he moved to the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, where he succumbed to the great plague of 1665. &#145;Mr Emannewell Decreets&#146; was buried there that year on 2 November. There is no consensus about works to be attributed to him.<br>
