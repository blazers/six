<div class="para">
<span class="headword">May,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1596, <em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">writer and historian</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas May (<i>d</i>. 1616) of Mayfield, Sussex, and Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1601/02), the daughter of Edward Rich of Horndon on the Hill, Essex. His grandfather, George May, had set up business as an iron-founder in Burwash, Surrey. George's son Thomas made a socially advantageous marriage into the Rich family; three years after his son's birth he purchased the manor of Mayfield; he was knighted in 1603 and seems to have had court connections, though there is no record of a formal office. His son was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on 7 September 1609 as fellow-commoner, and took the degree of BA in 1613. On 6 August 1615 May was admitted to Gray's Inn. Despite this pattern of advancing family prosperity, however, his father seems to have encountered financial difficulties, perhaps heightened by a new marriage which brought four young daughters, and he steadily sold off his estates. He died in July 1616, the inquisition post mortem giving the younger Thomas's age as 20 years 6 months at most. After his death the remaining properties were sold.<br>
<br>Left with a small annuity, and handicapped by a stammer which equipped him badly for a legal career, May turned to literary activities. He began with the drama. The first of two comedies, <span class="italic">The Heir</span>, which may have initially received a college performance, was acted at the Red Bull and published in 1622; <span class="italic">The Old Couple</span> was not published until 1658 but there is a record of a court performance in 1636 and it may have been written earlier. Both comedies dealt with the difficulties of young heirs in gaining their inheritance, though the theme was so conventional that the plays do not necessarily reflect his own experience. Their synthesis of Jonsonian satirical comedy with the more romantic conventions of Fletcher's comedy and tragicomedy was characteristic of the drama of the time, though May refrains from the bawdy language and risqu&eacute; situations which were also in fashion.<br>
<br>May's chief literary interest soon showed itself as the culture and politics of ancient Rome. The first among a series of distinguished translations from Latin was a rendering of the verse in John Barclay's neo-Latin <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i>, the <span class="italic">Argenis</span>, in Kingsmill Long's version of 1625. In the following year there appeared the first three books of his translation of Lucan's <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span>, a work which also strongly influenced his tragedy <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span>, acted in an unknown venue in the same year. The turn to a politically sensitive moment of Roman history may have been influenced by the rising political temperature in the last years of James I and the opening of his son's reign. When May published the full ten books in 1627, he dedicated individual books to figures like the earls of Warwick and Essex who were associated with patriotic independence, at a time of great anxiety about the king's apparent subservience to the unpredictable Buckingham. May's stance was politically sensitive: the dedications were excised from most copies. His tragedy of &#145;Julia Agrippina&#146;, acted in 1628, drew on Lucan in a stark portrayal of imperial corruption. His Latin tragedy of &#145;Julius Caesar&#146;, now lost, is likely to have shared these political concerns. His <span class="italic">Antigone</span> (published in 1631) is unusual among the dramas of the period in turning directly to Greek themes and tragic models, but this play too draws on Lucan as it pits universal justice against tyrannical wilfulness. Like May's earlier comedies, the plays followed a Jonsonian precedent, in this case his rigorously scholarly Roman tragedies, but again introduced more romantic elements of love-intrigue and pathos.<br>
<br>John Aubrey traced May's later republicanism to his early enthusiasm for Lucan  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.56). He was certainly not regarded as a republican during the &#145;king's peace&#146;, however; on the contrary, Sir John Suckling's &#145;A Sessions of the Poets&#146; implies that he became a credible candidate for succeeding Jonson as <i>de facto</i> poet laureate. In the aftermath of the Lucan translation the anti-imperial tone of his writings became somewhat muted. His verse translations were reused in Sir Robert Le Grys's new translation of the <span class="italic">Argenis</span> (1629), whose dedication emphasized that it had been commissioned by the king. Translations of Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span> (1628) and some of Martial's epigrams (1629) introduced a more regal vein to his translated texts, and in 1630 he published a <span class="italic">Continuation</span> of Lucan which offered a more sympathetic view of imperial power. This he dedicated to the king, and it was at the king's command, noted on the title-pages, that he now turned to English history in verse narratives of the reigns of <span class="italic">Henry II</span> (1633) and <span class="italic">Edward III</span> (1635). These poems, while they do not follow an obvious Caroline propaganda purpose, are sympathetic to the dilemmas of royal power. His version of Barclay's <span class="italic">Icon animorum</span> (1631) was dedicated in fulsome terms to Lord Chancellor Weston, and courtly connections are also shown in verses addressed to Queen Henrietta Maria. His plays were dedicated to figures with courtly and Catholic associations: <span class="italic">Antigone</span> to the leading courtier Endymion Porter, <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> and <span class="italic">Julia Agrippina</span> to Sir Kenelm Digby, for whose wife he composed an elegy. He wrote commendatory verses to a pastoral by Digby's friend Joseph Rutter, <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Holiday</span> (1635), and was praised by the court wit Thomas Carew. When May attended a court masque in 1634 he accidentally jostled the lord chamberlain, the earl of Pembroke, who angrily broke his staff across his shoulders, but Charles himself came to his rescue, calling him &#145;his poet&#146;. (The fact that he was unknown to Pembroke, however, suggests that he was not a great frequenter of the court&#151;where he never held any formal office.) Clarendon looked back to the May of the 1630s with some affection, praising his continuation of Lucan as &#145;for the learning, the wit, and the language &hellip; one of the best dramatic poems in the English language&#146;. He found in his friend no trace of the future parliamentarian:<blockquote>since his fortune could not raise his mind, he brought his mind down to his fortune, by a great modesty and humility in his nature, which was not affected, but very well became an imperfection in his speech, which was a great mortification to him, and kept him from entering upon any discourse but in the company of his very friends. (Hyde, 924)</blockquote>May kept company with the wits and scholars of Great Tew, and, persistent rumour had it, drank as convivially as any of the &#145;sons&#146; of Ben Jonson. Clarendon's strong moralism might have been expected to express open disapproval if later rumours of May as a promiscuous womanizer were true; all that is known of his personal life is that he died unmarried.<br>
<br>It was Sir William Davenant, not May, who succeeded Jonson as laureate in 1637. This event was said by Clarendon and other royalists to have poisoned May with resentment and led to his change of political allegiance. It is true that a poem possibly dating from this time, lamenting the effect of his stammer on his fortunes, indicates a sense of grievance at princes who favour the showy at the expense of reticent virtue; but there was no major withdrawal of royal favour, for in the same year the post of chronologer to London fell vacant and the king, Pembroke, and the earl of Dorset wrote in his support. Though he failed to obtain this post too, the failure could not be blamed on the king. His next major publication, a Latin version of his continuation of Lucan (1640), may show signs of a heightening of anti-courtly sentiment, but it was also dedicated to Charles.<br>
<br>In the political crisis of 1640&#150;42, however, May sided with parliament. Like many of the former Great Tew circle, he was divided in his loyalties. According to Aubrey, he had a long political discussion with his friend Sir Richard Fanshawe in the summer of 1642 before the two men parted to take up their respective parliamentarian and royalist allegiances. Rather than venting personal bitterness against the king, the treatise in which he justified his decision, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Success of Former Parliaments</span>, offers a dark view of the general tendency of monarchical institutions to threaten liberty whatever the character of the individual ruler. May's firm yet temperate style won him favour as a propagandist for parliament in pamphlets and newsbooks. <span class="italic">A True Relation from Hull</span> (1643) is the only work from this period to have been signed by May, but contemporaries assumed that he was involved in many other writings, and there is evidence for his association with <span class="italic">The Character of a Right Malignant</span> (1645), <span class="italic">The King's Cabinet Opened</span> (1645), and <span class="italic">The Lord George Digby's Cabinet and Dr. Goff's Negotiations</span> (1646). By 1645 he had gained enough notoriety both to be the object of satire in royalist newsbooks and to receive a defence in the moderate <span class="italic">The Great Assizes Holden in Parnassus</span>. In January 1646 May, along with John Sadler, was appointed secretary to parliament at a salary of &pound;200 per annum and awarded &pound;100 for work already undertaken. The charge to vindicate parliament's honour was fulfilled with the publication in May 1647 of <span class="italic">The History of the Parliament of England which Began November the Third, 1640</span>. May traced the origins of the civil war back to Elizabeth's reign and carried his story through to the siege of Gloucester, thus being able to end on a note of triumph. His brief as an official historian, at a time when growing divisions were emerging on parliament's side, necessitated a tone of careful impartiality despite the work's evident tendentiousness. He seems to have retained pre-war contacts with royalist poets: in 1646 he contributed commendatory verse to James Shirley's <span class="italic">Poems</span>. As political divisions widened in the post-war settlement, May sided with the emergent independent party. Charged to continue his <span class="italic">History</span>, in 1650 he produced as first instalment a Latin <span class="italic">Breviarium</span>, quickly translated into English, which condensed the 1647 volume and took the story up to the king's execution, offering a much more critical view than the <span class="italic">History</span> of the presbyterians and the Scots. He continued to work as a propagandist for parliament (<span class="italic">The Changeable Covenant</span>, 1650, may be his work), and his death on 13 November 1650 was marked by a state funeral and a memorial in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>It was also the occasion for the most vivid statement of the case against May's ingratitude, Andrew Marvell's satire &#145;Tom May's Death&#146;, which alleged that he choked to death in a drunken revelry. This poem's concluding vision of his expulsion from the abbey was prophetic: in September 1661 May's body was one of those exhumed by the triumphant royalists and reburied in St Margaret's, Westminster; six years later his former rival Sir William Davenant was buried in his place in the abbey. Marvell's poem perhaps spoke to suspicions of May that were found among some of the godly as well as among royalists: shortly after his death the puritan William Rowe linked him with a &#145;gang&#146; of atheists including Thomas Chaloner and Henry Neville. Aubrey much later claimed that he would &#145;speak slightly of the Trinity&#146; when in his cups, and that the obese poet had died when drunk by choking, because the string of his cap was too tight. Whatever substance this image of the unfaithful debauchee may have had, its later currency&#151;as considerably amplified by Anthony Wood&#151;can be explained by its offering a common denominator of familiar royalist and conservative parliamentarian stereotypes of the republican and the atheist. Though his translation of Lucan may have aroused suspicion, his original writings do not overtly challenge a mainstream protestantism.<br>
<br>Despite, or perhaps in part because of, his controversial reputation, May's writings continued to wield influence for some time after his death. Even Wood conceded the merits of his continuation of the <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span>, which continued to be regularly reprinted in continental editions of Lucan, though his English translation was superseded by Nicholas Rowe's more vigorous if less faithful version. <span class="italic">The Heir</span> was reworked in Susanna Centlivre's adaptation as <span class="italic">The Stolen Heiress</span> (1703). His <span class="italic">Breviary</span>, and the Lucan translation, were reprinted at the time of the exclusion crisis. When Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span>, which originated as a response to May, first appeared, whig writers championed May's superior truth and his less ornate style, and May's <span class="italic">History</span> held its own with such readers as William Warburton and the earl of Chatham, and down to a reissue in 1854. Thereafter, however, he fell from favour until a late twentieth-century revival of interest in classicizing historiography, in which his undoubted partisanship is recognized but more attention is paid to his qualities as a writer. His adaptation of Roman republican discourse to the circumstances of an early modern ideological civil war, his attempts to reconcile historical truth with the claims of the imagination, and his subdued sobriety of tone have earned him a new respect.<br>
