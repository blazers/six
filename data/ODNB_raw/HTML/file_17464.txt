<span class="headword">McDonnell,  Robert</span>  (1828&#150;1889), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born in Dublin on 15 March 1828, was the second son of John McDonnell (1796&#150;1892), surgeon, and his wife, Charity, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dobbs. He was a grandson of Dr James McDonnell, of Belfast, and a descendant of Ian Vohr of Isla and Kintyre, whose great-grandson was Alaster MacColl Macdonald. After a private education McDonnell entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1844. In the following year he was apprenticed to Richard Carmichael, on whose death in 1849 he was transferred to Robert Moore Peile. McDonnell graduated BA and MB in 1850, obtained the licence of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on 22 February 1851, and was admitted a fellow on 24 August 1853. He afterwards visited Edinburgh, Paris, and Vienna. In 1855, during the Crimean War, he was attached to the British hospital at Smyrna, and he volunteered as civil surgeon to serve in the general hospital in the camp before Sevastopol. For his services he received the British medal and clasp and the Turkish medal.<br>
<br>In 1856 McDonnell became demonstrator of anatomy in the Carmichael school of medicine; he later lectured there on anatomy and physiology. In 1857 he became MD at the University of Dublin, and in 1864 he was admitted to the degree of MD at the Queen's University of Ireland. He was appointed surgeon to Jervis Street Hospital in 1863, and three years later he was elected surgeon to Dr Steevens' Hospital and professor of descriptive anatomy in its medical school. In 1865 he married Mary McAuley (<i>d</i>. 1869). He later married Susan McCausland (<i>d</i>. 1891); they had at least one son.<br>
<br>In 1857 McDonnell was appointed medical superintendent of Mountjoy prison. In carrying out his official duties he came into collision with the prison's board over questions of the food supply and general treatment of the prisoners under his charge. He held that the medical officer should exercise an unfettered discretion in such matters. As the board decided otherwise, he resigned in 1867. Some demur was made to granting him a pension, but in the interests of his profession he fought out the battle, eventually obtaining the pension. The money thus acquired he contributed annually to the Medical Benevolent Fund. &#145;One must embrace the profession with ardour, and pay it no divided allegiance&#146;, McDonnell told his students  (Buckley, 66).<br>
<br>On new year's day 1847 John McDonnell was the first Irish surgeon to use ether; and according to J. D. Widdess the first recorded transfusion of blood to a human in Ireland was performed in Jervis Street Hospital on 20 April 1865 by Robert McDonnell, using his own blood  (Widdess, 13). The patient, a victim of tetanus, died, but in February 1870 McDonnell transfused blood to a 24-year-old woman exsanguinated by post-partum haemorrhage. She survived. The donor on that occasion was the lady's husband; fortunately their bloods were compatible, for blood groups were then unknown. McDonnell wrote no book but was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society; his remarkably varied contributions to surgical and scientific literature were so numerous that they fill a column of the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Scientific Papers</span>. He edited a volume of the works of Abraham Colles for the New Sydenham Society in 1881.<br>
<br>McDonnell died suddenly from heart disease at his home, 89 Merrion Square, Dublin, at 1 a.m. on 6 May 1889, and was buried at Kilsharvan, the family cemetery, near Drogheda, co. Louth.<br>
