<span class="headword">Livesey,  James</span>  (1626&#150;1682), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Heape, in the parish of Bury, Lancashire, on 1 January 1626, the son of Robert Livesey (1591?&#150;1675), yeoman. He was educated locally and on 9 May 1645 was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge. He did not complete his studies and on 26 February 1647 he was admitted sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA. He returned to Lancashire and was appointed minister at Turton, near Bolton, by the Bury classis on 23 October 1650. Here he married, probably in 1652, Elizabeth Chetham, daughter of George Chetham of Turton Tower (nephew of the philanthropist Humphrey Chetham). They had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1652 Livesey became minister at the chapel at Atherton or Chowbent, in the neighbouring parish of Leigh, then in the patronage of the godly magistrate John Atherton. Here he established a reputation as a zealous presbyterian, and published <span class="italic">Enchiridion judicum &hellip; a Sermon before the Judges &hellip; at Lancaster, March 26, 1655</span>, a lengthy exposition upon the alliance of magistracy and ministry, together with <span class="italic">Catastrophe magnatum &hellip; a Sermon &hellip; at the Funeral of &hellip; John Atherton</span> (1657). In 1657, following Atherton's death, the dean and chapter of Christ Church, Oxford, appointed him minister of the largely puritan-inclined parish of Great Budworth, Cheshire. In 1662 he initially failed to subscribe to the canons, but later reluctantly conformed and remained minister at Great Budworth. Nevertheless, he remained familiar with local nonconformists, especially the ejected minister Adam Martindale, and preached the funeral sermon for Martindale's son in 1680. His own son, Robert, became schoolmaster within his parish. Until his death he remained a zealous preacher and three further sermons were published in 1674. He died suddenly at Great Budworth on 7 February 1682. He was survived by his wife and clearly mourned by his parishioners, as shown by this excerpt from a poem penned by Thomas Bradshaw, rector of Lymm, for Livesey's funeral on 10 February, before burial at the church there:<blockquote>
<div>Great Budworth's faithfull pastour now is gone<br>
</div>
<div>And left his congregation here alone.<br>
</div>
<div>How desolate is she: well may she weep<br>
</div>
<div>Her learned Livesey now in Christ doth sleep.<br>
</div> (Shaw, <span class="italic">Minutes of Bury Presbyterian Classis</span>, 2.247&#150;50)</blockquote>
