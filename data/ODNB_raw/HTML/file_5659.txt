<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Roger  de</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1221, <em>d.</em> in or before 1286), <span class="occ">baron and soldier</span>, was the son of Roger de Clifford of Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire (<i>d</i>. 1230/1231), younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5665/', "Walter de Clifford")</script>, lord of Clifford, near Hay, Herefordshire, and of Sybil (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1221&#150;1253), daughter of Robert of Ewyas and widow of Robert de Tregoz and William of Newmarch. A minor at his father's death, Roger was in the custody of his uncle Walter, lord of Clifford, until he came of age, probably in 1242. He inherited lands in Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Berkshire from his father, held predominantly from his cousin, another Walter de Clifford. In 1248 he was granted a weekly market and annual fair at Tenbury. He spent the early part of his career as a knight of Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester. In 1248 he went on pilgrimage with the earl, and in 1254 he travelled with him to join Henry III in Gascony.<br>
<br>By the end of 1258 Clifford had joined the new political grouping which grew up around the Lord Edward, but in 1262 he was associated with Roger of Leybourne, who was accused of misappropriating funds from Edward. At this time Clifford, together with many of Edward's former intimates, abandoned the prince and joined the supporters of Simon de Montfort, and in May 1263, as a representative of the lords of the Welsh marches, wrote to the king urging him to uphold the provisions of Oxford. That August he and his fellows were forbidden to take part in tournaments, or to take up arms without royal licence, but despite this he was given command of the castles of Marlborough and Ludgershall. During 1263 Clifford campaigned in the Welsh marches with Roger of Leybourne and others, but by August they had been reconciled with the king and Edward. Clifford was pardoned for his activities, and in December was appointed sheriff of Gloucester, thereafter remaining loyal to Henry III. On 5 April 1264 he was present at the siege of Northampton, where he captured Simon de Montfort the younger. Himself taken at the battle of Lewes on 14 May, Clifford was released with the other marcher lords on condition that he would attend parliament when summoned, but he failed to do so. In October he besieged the castle at Hanley of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (son of his former lord).<br>
<br>In January 1265 Clifford was among those offered safe conducts to withdraw to Ireland for a year, but remained in England where he took part in negotiations between the Lord Edward and the barons. He fought for the king at Evesham, and played a role in the subsequent pacification of England. In August he was appointed justice of the forest south of the Trent, an office he held for the next sixteen years, and keeper of the peace in Westmorland. At this time he also served as constable of Gloucester and in various minor offices, and was twice sent to the marches to hear complaints on the king's behalf. He received substantial rewards for the services he performed for Henry III and his son. In 1261 he was granted a pension of 50 marks a year, and three years later Edward granted him land worth 100 marks in the honour of Monmouth. After Henry III's victory at Evesham he was given lands of rebels in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and elsewhere, and was pardoned a debt of nearly &pound;400. He also received the custody of Isabel, eldest daughter and coheir of the former rebel Robert de Vieuxpont, and married her to his own son Roger.<br>
<br>In 1270 Clifford joined the Lord Edward's crusade, and was one of the executors of the will made by him at Acre in 1272. After he took the cross he was promised the next available wardship worth more than &pound;500 p.a., because he had &#145;borne himself laudably in the king's service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1266&#150;72</i>, 448). While returning from the crusade through France he married a lady mysteriously designated the countess of Lerett, or Lauretania, whose identity remains obstinately impenetrable. It would seem that all that can be said of her is that she outlived her husband and was buried in Worcester Cathedral after her death in 1301. His first wife had probably been Hawisia, widow of John de Boterel, whose marriage was granted to Clifford's father for his son's use in 1230. In 1274 he negotiated a truce with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and in 1275 he acted as Edward I's proctor at the <i>parlement</i> of the king of France. In the following year he temporarily lost the custody of Eardisley Castle, when his bailiffs there threw the king's writ in the face of a royal messenger and threatened to kill him unless he left immediately. Between 1277 and 1280 he served as a justice on eyre for the forest, and in 1279 he was appointed justice of Wales. In 1282 Clifford was dragged from his bed and taken prisoner after a surprise attack on his castle of Hawarden by the Welsh prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd. His son, Roger the younger, was killed in the same year during an assault on Anglesey.<br>
<br>Clifford was still alive in 1284, when he granted &pound;10 to Westwood Priory, Worcestershire, and settled the manor of Severn Stoke on his younger grandson, another Roger. It may have been at this time that he founded a chantry in the parish church at Tenbury. He seems to have suffered some financial difficulty in his later years, for in the late 1270s he sold property in London to the city for 300 marks, and in December 1283 he and his heirs were pardoned half his outstanding debts to the king. He was dead by 3 April 1286 when his goods were impounded on account of debts owed to the crown, although the private property of his widow was exempted from this order. He was succeeded by his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5658/', "Robert Clifford (1274&#150;1314)")</script>, who inherited substantial property in Westmorland from his mother, Isabella de Vieuxpont (<i>d</i>. 1291), and was the first member of his family to receive a personal summons to parliament.<br>
