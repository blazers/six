<span class="headword">Marrat,  William</span>  (1772&#150;1852), <span class="occ">topographer and teacher of mathematics</span>, was born on 6 April 1772 at Sibsey, Lincolnshire, the son of John and Jane Marrat. Self-taught, he acquired a broad knowledge of literature and science, as well as French and German, and his writing on mechanics demonstrates a familiarity with continental mathematics.<br>
<br>For some years Marrat followed the trade of a printer and publisher at Boston, Lincolnshire. At other times he taught mathematics, both in Lincolnshire, and in New York, where he lived from 1817 to 1821. For most of his adult life he contributed articles to the popular press. His attempts to establish similar journals on his own behalf, however, met with little success; while in America he published the <span class="italic">Scientific Journal</span>, which ran for only nine issues in 1818; the magazine which he and Pishey Thompson had edited from Boston, Lincolnshire, <span class="italic">The Enquirer, or, Literary, Mathematical, and Philosophical Repository</span>, was issued only during 1811&#150;12. Marrat also wrote on the topography of his native county. His <span class="italic">History of Lincolnshire</span>, written during 1814&#150;16, was stopped after three volumes covering Holland and much of Kesteven, Marrat alleged, through Sir Joseph Banks's refusal to allow access to his papers, but his <span class="italic">Historical Description of Stamford</span> appeared in 1816.<br>
<br>On his return to England Marrat settled at Copperas Hill, Liverpool, where he published lunar tables, compiled tide tables for the port, and wrote his <span class="italic">Elements of Mechanical Philosophy</span> (1825). From 1833 to 1836 he taught mathematics in a school at Exeter, but on the death of his wife (whose identity is not known), he returned to Liverpool where his son, Frederick Price Marrat, was a conchologist at the Liverpool Museum. He died at his son's house, 15 White Mill Street, on 26 March 1852, and was buried at the city's necropolis.<br>
