<span class="headword">Oxburgh,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1716), <span class="occ">Jacobite insurgent</span>, was a member of a Roman Catholic family of Bovin, King's county, Ireland, a cadet branch of the Oxburghs of Emneth, Norfolk. A Hewer Oxburgh (a name common to both English and Irish branches of the family) had almost 1000 acres in King's county in 1655&#150;6. The family were staunch supporters of James II, with a Hewer Oxburgh serving as sheriff in 1687 and as an MP in 1689. Both a Colonel Francis Oxburgh and Henry Oxburgh were named as assessors for tax in King's county in April 1690, and a Henry Oxburgh served as a captain in Sir Hewer Oxburgh's infantry regiment. No fewer than six Oxburghs were attainted in 1691. A Colonel Oxburgh (probably Sir Hewer) was killed at Aughrim in July 1691, as his widow, Clare, filed a claim for her jointure out of his estate, and a Henry Oxburgh filed a claim for a remainder in tail.<br>
<br>In December 1692 Colonel Henry Oxburgh was arrested in Dublin as a precaution against a French descent. He may have been the Colonel Oxburgh who it was suggested might be secured from doing any mischief at home by serving in the army of the emperor or the duke of Bavaria in 1695. Henry served in the army of Louis XIV, and he may have returned home about 1700 and settled in Lancashire. However, in May 1705 and March 1714, Colonel Henry Oxburgh of Bovin, King's county, was licensed to carry arms. According to his own account, Oxburgh was in London when the oaths to George I were tendered &#145;and having truly a scrupulous conscience&#146;  (Boyer, 533&#150;5) he left London for the north. His claim to have been persuaded into the rising lacks credibility, and it seems that he was sent to foment rebellion in the guise of a tourist. He was present at the first gathering of the Jacobites in Northumberland, and was an important commander of the English forces during the rising.<br>
<br>Oxburgh led a party of soldiers to Lowther Hall, home of Viscount Lonsdale, and also to Hornby Hall, the residence of Colonel Francis Charteris. He was &#145;frequently at the head of the English horse&#146;  (Boyer, 522) during the march into Lancashire, and a key adviser of the commanders, Thomas Forster and Lord Widdrington. Having reached Preston and being confronted by Hanoverian troops under the command of General Charles Wills, Forster decided to treat for terms. Oxburgh was subsequently blamed for this decision, some Jacobites opining that &#145;he was better at his beads and prayers, than at his business as a soldier, and we all thought him fitter for a priest than a field-officer&#146;  (Patten, 121). Oxburgh was sent into the English camp on the grounds that he had an acquaintance with some English officers, but he met an intransigent Wills who would only offer surrender &#145;at discretion&#146;. Some dispute remains about whether Wills implied that he would intervene with the king by saying &#145;you cannot better entitle yourselves to clemency than by surrendering yourselves prisoners at discretion&#146;  (Ware, 140). In the event the Jacobites surrendered and Oxburgh was sent to London.<br>
<br>Oxburgh was tried on 7 May 1716. His defence counsel argued that the indictment was invalid as it referred to &#145;Colonel Oxborough&#146;, and that he had only ever worn a sword (the normal attire of a gentleman), had not committed any overt act of hostility, and that his being sent by the rebels to treat was not manifest treason. Lord Chief Justice Parker dismissed these arguments and Oxburgh was sentenced to death on the 9th. Oxburgh petitioned for clemency, but there is no evidence that his petition reached the king and on 14 May he was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn. In his speech from the scaffold he denied that the rebellion was designed to re-establish Roman Catholicism in England, &#145;for I never could find, that either by the laws of God, or the ancient constitution of this nation, difference of religion in the prince made any change in the allegiance of the subject&#146;  (Szechi, 66). His head was placed on Temple Bar which, according to reports reaching the Jacobite court, occasioned some resentment among the populace. It appears that Oxburgh was married, for following his execution Queen Mary evinced some concern for his children. His estate was confiscated and sold.<br>
