<span class="headword">Dickson <span class="st"> [Dick]</span>,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1583&#150;1662), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born in Glasgow, the only son of John Dick or Dickson, a wealthy and devout Glaswegian merchant. He was educated at the University of Glasgow and, after graduating MA, served an eight-year term as a regent of the university. On 23 September 1617 he married Margaret Roberton (<i>d</i>. in or before 1662) and on 31 March 1618 was ordained minister of Irvine, Ayrshire. After publicly testifying against the five articles of Perth he was summoned to appear before the court of high commission at Edinburgh on 9 January 1622. He declined the jurisdiction of the court in what he maintained was a purely ecclesiastical matter, was deprived the following day, and was confined to Turriff, Aberdeenshire. He was permitted to return to Irvine at the end of July 1623, where he remained, relatively unmolested, until 1640.<br>
<br>During the 1620s and 1630s Dickson became one of the leading members of what David Stevenson has termed the kirk's &#145;radical party&#146;  (Stevenson, 24). This band of zealous presbyterians opposed the religious policies of James VI and Charles I and reacted against them by holding conventicles, private prayer meetings where the godly could assemble for religious instruction and mutual edification. By all accounts Dickson was a powerful preacher of &#145;experimental Calvinism&#146;. His method and style of preaching were considered by many of his contemporaries to be second only to those of William Guthrie, minister of Fenwick. Serious Christians from all over Scotland converged on Irvine to hear his sermons, particularly during communion seasons, the kirk's twice yearly celebration of the Lord's supper. It was during one such season, under Dickson's preaching, that the famous revival of religion known as the &#145;Stewarton sickness&#146; broke out in Irvine and its environs  (Tweedie, 8).<br>
<br>In the early years of his ministry Dickson's expository sermons on various books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> were transcribed by his auditors and widely circulated in manuscript form among the godly. In response to the demand for his sermons Dickson developed a plan, with the approval of his radical colleagues, to produce a series of brief popular biblical commentaries, the first instalment of which was <span class="italic">A Short Explanation of the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews</span> (Aberdeen, 1635).<br>
<br>During the tumultuous period leading up to and following the signing of the national covenant in 1638 Dickson emerged as one of the natural leaders of the presbyterian party. Together with Alexander Henderson he was instrumental in organizing the infamous prayer book riots which occurred at Edinburgh on 23 July 1637. He also influenced the presbytery of Irvine to denounce the prayer book and petition the Scottish council to suspend letters of horning issued against ministers who refused to purchase copies. In 1638 he was one of the ministers who engaged in a polemical war with the &#145;Aberdeen doctors&#146;, a group of six Arminian ministers holding the degree of doctor of divinity who supported the religious policies of Charles I. In response to the doctors' anti-covenanting pamphlet, <span class="italic">Generall Demands Concerning the Late Covenant</span> (Aberdeen, 1638) Dickson and Henderson wrote <span class="italic">Ansueris of Sum Bretheren of the Ministrie</span> (Aberdeen, 1638). He was a member of the 1638 Glasgow general assembly and, according to Robert Wodrow, &#145;made a great figure there&#146;, giving a learned discourse against Arminianism, and delivering an influential speech when the king's commissioner threatened to leave the assembly  (Tweedie, 10). The following year he was elected moderator of the general assembly which met at Edinburgh, and distinguished himself by his &#145;wise management&#146; of the assembly's business at &#145;so critical a juncture&#146;  (Tweedie, 10).<br>
<br>Throughout the 1640s Dickson continued to be very active in the affairs of the national kirk. In 1640 he was translated to the newly created professorship of divinity at the University of Glasgow, and was admitted to the collegiate charge of St Mungo's. He appears to have relinquished his ministerial charge after attending one session meeting, but continued to preach frequently at the kirk. During the 1640 general assembly Dickson staunchly defended the radicals' practice of conventicling against the attacks of Henry Guthry, and for his pains was verbally abused by the assembly's conservative members. From 1642 onwards, as a regular member of the general assembly's powerful standing committee, the commission for the public affairs of the kirk, he continued to defend the radicals' use of conventicles and support their calls for the further reformation of the national kirk. In 1643 he was appointed by the general assembly, along with Alexander Henderson and David Calderwood, to draw up a directory for public worship. Two years later he published a learned commentary on <span class="roman">St Paul's epistles</span>, <span class="italic">Expositio analytica omnium apostolicarum epistolarum</span> (1645), and subsequently a second popular commentary, <span class="italic">A Brief Exposition of the Gospel According to Matthew</span> (1647).<br>
<br>In early 1650 Dickson was translated to the chair of divinity at Edinburgh and appointed to the second charge of St Giles. The same year he and James Durham produced their famous <span class="italic">Sum of Saving Knowledge</span>, an important work espousing federal theology which, while never officially sanctioned by the kirk, was traditionally bound with the Westminster confession of faith and catechisms. In February 1650 Dickson abandoned his allegiance to the kirk regime's radical party and joined with the forces of the &#145;new moderatism&#146; in calling for the return of Charles II from exile. Following the Cromwellian invasion of Scotland in the summer of 1650 he resisted the radicals' demands for a severe purge of the covenanting army in accordance with the 1646 and 1649 acts of classes, and supported the moderate controlled commission's public resolution to allow royalist malignants and former engagers back into the military. In early 1651 he wrote a number of papers vindicating the commission's role in this matter, including &#145;No separation of the weill affected from the army of the covenanters&#146;. In May 1651 he supported the commission's second public resolution, which paved the way for parliament's full repeal of the acts of classes. During the ensuing schism at the 1651 general assembly he sided with the &#145;resolutioners&#146; against his former radical colleagues, the &#145;protesters&#146;. He was elected moderator of the equally controversial 1652 general assembly, and as outgoing moderator the following year, saw the assembly dissolved by English troops before it could be constituted. Throughout the remainder of the 1650s Dickson remained a zealous resolutioner and, together with his colleagues &#145;the Ministers of Edinburgh&#146;, led the national party during the assembly's suspension. During 1655 and 1656 he was instrumental in the resolutioners reaching an accord with Lord Broghill and the Scottish council, and in 1657 and 1659 he and his colleague Robert Douglas helped to direct the activities of the party's agent, James Sharp, in his sojourns at London.<br>
<br>At the height of the protester&#150;resolutioner controversy Dickson found time to return to his plan for a series of popular commentaries and published his three-volume <span class="italic">Brief Explication of the Psalms</span> (London, 1653&#150;4). He also returned to his academic writings, and, two years later, produced his most important theological work, an exposition of federal theology entitled, <span class="italic">Therapeutica sacra</span> (London, 1656).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Dickson refused to take the oath of supremacy and in October 1662 was ejected from his university chair and ministerial charge. The hardships which resulted from this loss broke his health, and in December of the same year he fell extremely ill and died in Edinburgh before the month was out. He was buried on 31 December. Among his last spoken words are those recorded by his friend and former radical colleague John Livingstone:<blockquote>I have taken all my good deeds, and all my bad deeds, and cast them through each other in a heap before the Lord, and fled from both, and have betaken me to the Lord Jesus Christ, and in him I have sweet peace. (Tweedie, 12)</blockquote>
