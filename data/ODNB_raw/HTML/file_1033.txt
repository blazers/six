<span class="headword">Baggs,  Charles Michael</span>  (1806&#150;1845), <span class="occ">college head and vicar apostolic of the western district</span>, was born at Belville, in co. Meath, Ireland, on 21 May 1806. He was the eldest son of a protestant barrister of Dublin, Charles Baggs, afterwards judge of the court of vice-admiralty in Demerara, and his wife, Eleanor, fourth daughter of John Howard Kyan, of Mount Howard and Ballymurtagh in the county of Wicklow. His father being a member of the established church of Ireland, Baggs's early education was at a protestant academy kept by a Mr King at Englefield Green in Surrey. Early in 1820 his father died suddenly at Demerara, three days after hearing of the death of a friend for whom he had become security for &pound;60,000. Upon the news of this double calamity Charles Baggs was removed by his mother from Englefield Green to the Catholic school of Sedgley Park in Staffordshire, and from this time he was a member of the Roman Catholic church. He remained at Sedgley Park until June 1821, when, at the suggestion of William Poynter, vicar apostolic of the London district, he was transferred as an ecclesiastical student to St Edmund's College near Ware, Hertfordshire, where he remained for three years.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1824 Baggs was sent to the English College at Rome, which, from the date of his arrival on 9 June, became his home for nearly twenty years. His reputation as a student was always excellent. He took first prizes in Hebrew, mathematics, physics, and scripture, and was highly commended in theology. His remarkable ability was exhibited on 25 September 1830 when, in the presence of a distinguished audience presided over by Cardinal Zurla, he held his ground defending his theological theses in Latin. This display won for him his doctor's cap at the early age of twenty-four.<br>
<br>Baggs was ordained priest in December 1830. For several years he occupied the chair of professor of Hebrew at the English College. His knowledge of French and Italian in particular, as well as of Spanish and German, was remarkable. As a pulpit orator he soon became well known outside the walls of the college. His earliest published discourse was <span class="italic">On the Supremacy of the Roman Pontiffs</span>, delivered on 7 February 1836 in the fashionable church of Ges&ugrave; e Maria in the via del Corso, and was issued from the press immediately afterwards, with an appendix in which he challenged some of the arguments of contemporary Anglican divines. The work was dedicated to Cardinal Weld. On 8 March 1836 his <span class="italic">Letter Addressed to the Rev. R. Burgess, Protestant Chaplain at Rome</span> appeared. This was a controversial piece, which in the same year was translated into Italian by Baggs himself.<br>
<br>His skill in languages, interest in controversy, and immersion in the Roman scene recall Wiseman's early career, and it is not surprising that in 1834 Wiseman made Baggs vice-rector of the college. Throughout the pontificate of Gregory XVI Baggs was &#145;cameriere d'onore&#146;, a member of the papal household. Upon him devolved the duty of presenting all the English visitors, both Catholic and protestant, who were admitted to a private audience with the pope. In this capacity Baggs enjoyed a high degree of popularity, not only among his co-religionists but among his compatriots generally.<br>
<br>Baggs's monograph entitled <span class="italic">The Papal Chapel Described and Illustrated from History and Antiquities</span> appeared at Rome in 1839, inscribed to Charles (later Cardinal) Acton. It was at one time popular as a handbook for English-speaking visitors, as was his larger work, <span class="italic">The Ceremonies of Holy Week at the Vatican and S. John Lateran's: Described and Illustrated from History and Antiquities</span>, published almost simultaneously. It was Baggs's practice to dedicate his publications to persons of influence in England or Rome and the last named was addressed to Hugh Charles, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. It is dated 16 March 1839. During the following year Baggs published another work of ecclesiastical antiquarianism, <span class="italic">The Pontifical Mass sung at St Peter's Church on Easter Sunday, on the Festival of SS. Peter and Paul, and Christmas Day, with a Dissertation on Ecclesiastical Vestments</span>. This work was dedicated to Cardinal James Giustiniani, bishop of Albano and protector of the English College. These liturgical and antiquarian writings reflect the interests at this time of many catholics in England, where, following Catholic emancipation, many new churches were being built. The great patron of A. W. Pugin and the Gothic revival was John, sixteenth earl of Shrewsbury; when his daughter Lady Gwendoline Talbot, the Princess Borghese, died in Rome it was Baggs who preached the funeral oration at San Carlo in the Corso on 23 December 1840. She was a cousin of Baggs and when the panegyric was printed he inscribed it to the father of the young princess.<br>
<br>Four months before this, Baggs became rector of the English College when his predecessor, Wiseman, was consecrated as bishop of Melipotamus on 8 June 1840. During the last ten years of his sojourn in Rome, Baggs continued to distinguish himself as a controversialist. On 30 June 1842 he read to the Accademia di Religione Cattolica his dissertation on the Puseyites. This was written in Italian to explain to a Roman audience the situation in the Church of England and the differences between the evangelicals, the high-church party, and the followers of Pusey. It is of special interest because it was composed before J. H. Newman joined the Church of Rome. Together with another treatise in Italian, <span class="italic">On the Present State of the Church of England</span>, it was subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Annali delle Scienze Religiose</span> (vol. 40, 1842, 60&#150;92, and vol. 42, 1843, 94&#150;117). It was during Baggs's rectorship that the English College was honoured by the visit of Pope Gregory XVI on 25 February 1843. His career at Rome was closed by his elevation to the episcopate. On 28 January 1844, in the church of San Gregorio on the Caelian Hill, he was consecrated bishop of Pella <i>in partibus infidelium</i> by Cardinal Fransoni, assisted by George Brown, then bishop of Tloa and afterwards of Liverpool, and by Dr Collier, the bishop of Port Louis in Mauritius.<br>
<br>In England the sudden death of Bishop Peter Augustine Baines had left vacant the office of vicar apostolic of the western district; Gregory XVI selected Baggs to fill it. He was the only secular priest to occupy that position in the 162 years of its existence. It was a surprise appointment and although Baggs's name had been put forward in 1840, he was not considered then to be a suitable candidate for the episcopate because of his lack of experience. On his departure from Rome the pope made him a present of books, while the students of the English College gave him a costly pectoral cross, and even the English protestants in Rome subscribed to buy him a crucifix. He formally took possession of his diocese on 30 May 1844, when he was welcomed by a large gathering of the clergy and laity at Prior Park near Bath. Here, two days afterwards, he held his first ordination. He visited his extensive diocese during the course of that summer, and reorganized it into four deaneries on 2 October. Shortly after taking up his residence at Prior Park, Baggs delivered a course of lectures on the supremacy of the pope in the church of St John the Evangelist at Bath. In August 1845 he suffered a nervous breakdown and spent some time convalescing at Lord Clifford's seaside residence. He returned to Prior Park, but died there on 16 October 1845 at the early age of thirty-nine. He was buried in the partially completed new church of Prior Park College on 23 October; his remains were removed a few years later to the nearby Midford Chapel and subsequently to Holy Souls cemetery, Arnos Vale, Bristol.<br>
<br>Some contemporaries attributed Baggs's early death to his inability to adapt to the English climate after so many years in Rome&#151;&#145;climate&#146; being understood in more than a meteorological sense. Among the papers relating to the choice of his successor there is a submission from England to Rome that passes the following verdict on Baggs's brief episcopate:<blockquote>Never perhaps was there a man less fitted for the situation of vicar apostolic in England than Dr Baggs, and had it not pleased God to take him to himself he would in a short time have thrown the District into irremediable confusion. The chief cause of Dr Baggs' unfitness for the office of vicar apostolic arose from his being taken immediately from a College. He knew nothing of the duties of a missionary priest, he was quite ignorant of the peculiar difficulties of their situation and was always expecting everything to be done as if we were living in a catholic country. Dr Baggs having always been at College where everything, food, clothes etc were supplied him, had no idea of the value of money and consequently spent money most recklessly and imagined that his priests could do the same. In fact he never had been a missionary and a vicar apostolic in England will never be any good except he has been a missionary. (Archives of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide, Rome, MS Anglia 10, fol. 845)</blockquote>
