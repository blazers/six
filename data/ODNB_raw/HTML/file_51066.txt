<span class="headword">Heimann <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Klatzko]</span>,  Paula Gertrude</span>  (1899&#150;1982), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 3 February 1899 in Danzig, Poland, the fourth and youngest child of Russian Jewish parents. Heimann would later reflect that she was a replacement for a sister who had died; indeed this family background is significant in the context of her subsequent analytic experiences. Heimann's medical and psychiatric training, which was classically Freudian, was conducted at several German universities (she took her MD in 1928 in Berlin), during which time she married Franz Heimann, a specialist in internal medicine; in 1925 she gave birth to their only daughter Mirza. While living in Berlin, Heimann was analysed by Theodor Reik with a view to formally treating patients of her own, and she qualified in 1932 as associate member of the Berlin Psycho-Analytic Society.<br>
<br>Threatened under Nazism, Franz Heimann left for Switzerland while Paula and Mirza, denied the right to visit him, stayed in Germany. Mother and daughter left for Britain in July 1933 with psychoanalyst Kate Friedlander, shortly after charges which had implicated Heimann in the Reichstag fire had been dropped; Heimann had been arrested following a party she had thrown on the night of the fire, an act which was taken to be a sign of her complicity. Heimann was first given a licence to practise in the East End of London cheek by jowl with prostitutes and criminals, but eventually she became part of a more conventional psychoanalytic circle in west central London. Supported by colleague Ernest Jones and friends such as the novelist Winifred Bryher, Heimann continued her training, obtained British medical qualifications at Edinburgh University in 1938, and was elected to associate membership of the British Psycho-Analytical Society in November 1933, leading to full membership in 1939; in 1944 she was recognized as a training analyst.<br>
<br>During her first few years in London, Heimann was assiduously courted by Melanie Klein as a confidant and disciple. Heimann had counselled Klein after the death of her son, but the roles were soon reversed when Heimann entered into a protracted analysis with Klein from approximately 1935 to 1953 (Heimann's marriage broke down in the early thirties). Colleagues saw the relationship between the two women as intense (replicating Heimann's relationship with her mother) and parasitical (Klein has been accused of stealing Heimann's ideas and passing them off as her own), and in the late 1940s Heimann staged a bid for independence. This was a courageous move given Klein's reputation and was to leave Heimann feeling &#145;traumatized&#146;.<br>
<br>Taking a role in the British Psycho-Analytical Society's &#145;Controversial Discussions&#146; of the validity of Klein's theories in the early 1940s Heimann was enlisted as her spokesperson and &#145;crown princess&#146;  (King, 6). Members of the society debated whether Klein's work was faithful to Freudian dogma or sufficiently divergent as to constitute a new school. Classic Freudians particularly took issue with Klein's reliance on psychiatry to theorize psychosis and her manipulation of Freud's concept of the death instinct. Heimann herself was already feeling her allegiance to Klein on the wane. She unofficially abdicated her position with the publication of her classic paper &#145;On counter-transference&#146; (1950), which was later seen as a major contribution to psychoanalysis. The paper, arguing, against the tide of prevailing opinion, that the analyst's emotional responses to the patient could be a useful tool rather than an obstacle to analysis, enraged Klein, who saw it as a negation of her theories. Heimann's revolutionary idea was that counter-transference could be used to probe the patient's unconscious: the analyst's emotional attitude to the patient could be treated as clinical evidence because this response could be judged to be based on a correct analysis of the patient's motivations or intent. Heimann later took issue with Klein over her concept of innate envy, and in November 1955 officially resigned from the Melanie Klein Trust, becoming an independent for the rest of her career. In a sense Heimann had always been part of the independent, or Middle, group, a position which allowed her to maintain a balance between the more traditional Freudians and the Kleinians. Many feel her best work emanated from the divergence and rift from Klein, but she subsequently coupled Freudian theories with developments in ego psychology to develop original theories on narcissism and creativity, forming a close theoretical bond with Donald Winnicott. In 1947 Winnicott had voiced similar ideas regarding counter-transference, most notably that analysts must &#145;contain&#146; the hatred evoked in them by their patients.<br>
<br>While Heimann is often portrayed as a passive pawn in Melanie Klein's power games this is to underestimate her own strong-mindedness, sense of humour, and charm. She died on 24 October 1982 at 42 Nottingham Place, Westminster, having continued to play a vital role in the society until her death. Her theories on counter-transference forever changed the relationship between analyst and analysand.<br>
