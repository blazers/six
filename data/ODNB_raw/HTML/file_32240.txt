<span class="headword">Caird, Sir  James, of Glenfarquhar</span>, baronet  (1864&#150;1954), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born in Glasgow on 2 January 1864, the elder son in a family of six of James Caird, lawyer, and his wife, Mary Ann Hutcheson. Educated at Glasgow Academy, he joined the firm of William Graham &amp; Co., East India merchants, in 1878. Eleven years later he went to London and in 1890 joined Turnbull, Martin &amp; Co., managers of the Scottish Shire Line of steamships. By hard work and enterprise he prospered, and in twelve months was made manager. By 1903 he was sole partner and owner of the Scottish Shire Line, and in co-operation with the Houlder and Federal Lines he opened up the trade between the United Kingdom and the Antipodes. Early in 1916 he started a new shipyard at Chepstow to build standard ships quickly where enemy attacks could not interfere with production.<br>
<br>Overcoming immense difficulties, the venture succeeded so well that in 1917 the government stepped in and bought out Caird and his associates. Foreseeing the slump in shipping which would follow the end of the First World War, Caird in the same year sold to the Clan Line his interest in the Shire Line, and in Turnbull, Martin &amp; Co. He remained a director of some twenty-five companies connected with shipping, shipbuilding, ship repairing, and allied industries, as well as being chairman of the Smithfield and Argentine Meat Company, in which he held a large block of founders' shares.<br>
<br>By then Caird was a comparatively rich man, and from the early 1920s he devoted a large part of his fortune to preserving British naval and shipping memorials, to which he became passionately devoted. In association with the Society for Nautical Research he provided most of the money needed to repair and restore HMS <i>Victory</i> (Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar, berthed at Portsmouth) with an initial sum of &pound;50,000 to start the work and a further &pound;15,000 to enable it to continue. In 1927 steps were being taken to found a national museum of the sea, a venture to which Caird gave his wholehearted and energetic support. Under the chairmanship of the seventh Earl Stanhope, and in association with the honorary secretary, Geoffrey Callender, of the Society for Nautical Research, a board of trustees, of whom Caird was one, was set up to found the new museum. The realization of this project became possible when the Royal Hospital school moved to Holbrook and the old school buildings at Greenwich, including the Queen's House, became vacant. Caird then guaranteed to meet the whole cost (amounting eventually to over &pound;80,000) of converting the buildings. In addition, he began purchasing every available collection or individual item of maritime historical interest, including rare books, globes, atlases, instruments, and manuscripts. The Macpherson collection of sea pictures and the <i>Mercury</i> collection of ships' models were secured, and to these he added his own collections. During the second reading of the <span class="roman">National Maritime Museum Bill</span> in the House of Commons in June 1934 it was stated that the collections Caird had already offered to the nation were worth more than &pound;300,000.<br>
<br>The new museum was opened by King George VI in April 1937 and Caird continued his never-flagging interest and support. In all, he gave more than &pound;1.25 million to the museum. His account of the inception of the National Maritime Museum was published in <span class="italic">Syren and Shipping</span> (2 January 1935), under the title &#145;A museum in the making&#146;. To the last, when he became too ill to take an active part, he continued to shower his gifts upon it. His name is perpetuated in the Caird Library and the Caird Entrance. A Caird medal has been awarded annually since 1984. The Caird Fund makes grants for maritime research and finances Caird fellowships. Nor were the museum and HMS <i>Victory</i> alone in benefiting from his generosity. The historic 74-gun ship of the line HMS <i>Implacable</i> (the last survivor of the enemy ships that fought at Trafalgar) was also saved by him in the years between the wars. She was sunk with naval honours in 1949, her timbers having deteriorated beyond repair. To museums and art galleries in his native Scotland he was a generous benefactor; and in the Second World War he provided the cost of a complete ambulance unit. To his parish church, St Mary's, Wimbledon, his gifts included a house for the curate and money for the new church spire.<br>
<br>Caird was stocky in stature, tough and wiry, with immense energy, a shrewd expression, a merry twinkle in his eye, and a delightful Scots voice. He was the kindliest of men, generous almost to a fault, but never making a show of his benefactions, shrouding his greatest gifts in secrecy, and never seeking any reward. He nevertheless loved to drive a hard bargain and could not bear to be &#145;had&#146;; but he was always scrupulously fair and often gave more than was asked when he thought the seller might be in need, or even that a dealer was not taking sufficient profit.<br>
<br>Until his illness in 1949 Caird continued to attend his office in the City daily. He was extremely alert and had an excellent memory. He celebrated his eightieth birthday at his home in Scotland by bringing down a &#145;royal&#146; after a long day's stalk, which many a younger man would have given up. It was this wonderful vitality and his simple way of living which endeared him so much to all around him at Glenfarquhar, Fordoun, where he dispensed quiet yet generous hospitality in which gillies, keepers, shepherds, and guests shared alike.<br>
<br>In 1928 Caird was created a baronet; and after the opening of the new museum in 1937 the prime minister wanted to submit his name for a peerage, but Caird refused, saying that he did not want reward for what he had done or for what he had given to the nation.<br>
<br>Caird married in 1894 Henrietta Anna (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of William Henry Stephens, architect, of Ardshane, Holywood, co. Down. They had one daughter but no son and on Caird's death at his home, Well House, Arthur Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 27 September 1954, the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
