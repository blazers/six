<span class="headword">Mendes da Costa,  Benjamin</span>  (1704&#150;1764), <span class="occ">philanthropist and merchant</span>, was born in Amsterdam, the son of Luis (Abraham) Henriques Mendes da Costa (1652&#150;1724), merchant, and his wife, Theresa (Judith) Salazar. His parents were the descendants of Iberian Jews who had converted to Christianity in the late middle ages and later found refuge from inquisitorial persecution in St Esprit de Bayonne in south-western France. About 1700 they migrated to Amsterdam, then the hub of the western Sephardi diaspora. Benjamin later moved to London, becoming an endenizened citizen in 1725. His first wife was Judith (<i>d</i>. 1736), the daughter of Raphael Mendes da Costa, with whom he had two sons, Abraham and Raphael, both of whom predeceased him. After Judith died in 1736, he married Rebecca Alvares Pereira.<br>
<br>A successful overseas merchant, Mendes da Costa was a leader of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community of London in the mid-eighteenth century. He was elected to the <i>mahamad</i> (council) of the synagogue in Bevis Marks five times between 1730 and 1762. In 1746, following the defeat of a Jewish naturalization bill in the Irish parliament in two consecutive years (1745 and 1746), the <i>mahamad</i> appointed a five member &#145;committee of diligence&#146; to monitor legislative efforts to regulate the legal status of Jews in Great Britain; the committee, in turn, made Mendes da Costa its president. When George III ascended the throne in 1760, the congregation chose seven members, including Mendes da Costa, to offer its congratulations and to request a continuation of the Hanoverian policy of toleration. The <i>deputados</i>, as they were known, drafted a congratulatory address, which Mendes da Costa and three other members of the committee presented in November 1760. The committee did not disband afterwards but, with the addition of delegates from the Ashkenazi synagogues, evolved slowly into a permanent representative body, the Board of Deputies of British Jews.<br>
<br>In addition to serving as a communal leader, Mendes da Costa was also a generous benefactor, primarily but not exclusively of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community. He established two funds to support students at the congregational school, one in memory of his deceased son Raphael. He supported the establishment of Jewish communities in British North America, promoting the settlement of Jews in South Carolina and contributing to the erection of a new synagogue building in New York. In 1747 he purchased and donated to his own congregation the remainder of the lease on the congregation's building. Toward the end of his life, his annual benefactions totalled &pound;3000. In his will he left bequests to Sephardi and Ashkenazi charities as well as to the Christian poor of St Katharine Cree.<br>
<br>Mendes da Costa was a member of a far-flung, complex clan of New Christian origin whose various branches used either or both of the surnames da Costa and Mendes. Its most prominent English members included the wealthy widow Catherine Mendes da Costa, who married into the landed gentry; the rake Philip Mendes da Costa; and the mineralogist and conchologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6374/', "Emanuel Mendes da Costa")</script>, a brother of Philip.<br>
<br>Benjamin died on 28 March 1764 at his home in Bury Street, St Mary Axe, London, and was buried in the city's Spanish and Portuguese Jewish cemetery on Mile End Road.<br>
