<span class="headword">Russell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Black]</span>,  Dora Winifred</span>  (1894&#150;1986), <span class="occ">writer and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 3 April 1894 at 1 Mount Villas, Luna Road, Thornton Heath, Croydon, the second of three daughters and second of four children of Sir Frederick William Black (1863&#150;1930), clerk in the Admiralty and later senior civil servant, and his wife, Sarah Isabella Davisson. She was educated at Sutton high school and Girton College, Cambridge, where she was awarded a first class in the medieval and modern languages tripos in 1915. She began research on eighteenth-century French philosophers at University College, London, but in 1917 went to the United States as personal assistant to her father, who was head of a special government mission to persuade the American government to re-route some of its oil tankers to Britain. She was appointed MBE for this in 1918. Shortly after her return she was elected to a fellowship by Girton, and returned to Cambridge in 1918.<br>
<br>In 1916 Dora had met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35875/', "Bertrand Arthur William Russell (1872&#150;1970)")</script>, already famous as a mathematician and philosopher, and notorious as a pacifist. Bertrand Russell was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24324/', "John Russell, Viscount Amberley (1842&#150;1876)")</script>, MP for Nottingham. He became third Earl Russell in 1931. They began an affair in 1919. She visited Russia in 1920, and on her return took to wearing peasant-style clothes. She remained an enthusiastic supporter of the Soviet Union all her life. In 1921 she wrote &#145;The soul of Russia and the body of America&#146;, which was finally incorporated in <span class="italic">The Religion of the Machine Age</span> (1983). She resigned her Girton fellowship in 1920 in order to accompany Russell to Russia and China.<br>
<br>Russell was married, although separated, and had no children. Although Dora disapproved of marriage she agreed to marry him when she became pregnant, as he was anxious to produce a legitimate heir. On their return from China he divorced his wife and married Dora in the same month, September 1921, two months before their son John (1921&#150;1987), later fourth Earl Russell, was born.<br>
<br>They bought a house in Chelsea, and Dora soon became aware of the difficulties involved in being married to a much older, famous man. Although Russell supported women's suffrage, he believed that women were less intelligent than men, and that their main function was to be wives and mothers. His friends adopted a patronizing attitude towards Dora, assuming that any ideas she might express came from him. She was determined to have an identity separate from that of her husband, and to escape from the shadow of his reputation. She joined the Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for Chelsea in the autumn of 1924. She helped to form the Workers' Birth Control Group in 1924, and threw herself into the campaign for birth-control advice to be given to all women. In 1925 she published <span class="italic">Hypatia, or, Women and Knowledge</span>, followed by <span class="italic">The Right to be Happy</span> in 1927.<br>
<br>In 1927 Dora and Bertrand Russell started Beacon Hill School at Telegraph House, on the South Downs, in order to educate their own children in the company of others, because no existing school seemed satisfactory. The plan was to do away with excessive discipline, religious instruction, and the tyranny of adults. It was a joint venture, although Dora was responsible for the day-to-day organization, while Bertrand financed it through writing popular books and lecture tours in the United States. The school was ridiculed in the press, and Bertrand Russell later claimed it was a failure, but it embodied many progressive ideas. Dora published <span class="italic">In Defence of Children</span> in 1932.<br>
<br>Bertrand Russell left Dora, and the school, in 1932, after she had had two children with Griffin Barry, an American journalist. Although they had always insisted on their freedom to have affairs with other people, Russell could not accept her extending this to the freedom to have another man's child. They were divorced in 1935. She managed to carry on the school alone, moving several times after leaving Telegraph House in 1934. She had a brief affair with a communist, Paul Gillard, before he was murdered, and on 29 June 1940 married his friend, Gordon (Pat) Grace (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), a working-class Irish communist who was helping her to run the school. He was the son of Patrick Grace, clothier, and he died in 1949.<br>
<br>Dora closed the school in 1943, and went to London to work at the Ministry of Information, moving to the Soviet relations division in 1944 to work on <span class="italic">British Ally</span>, a weekly paper published by the British government in Moscow. When the paper was closed down in 1950 she lost her job. Unable to find another, she devoted herself to feminist causes and the women's peace movement. She was a member of the Six Point Group (a discussion and political pressure organization) and the Married Women's Association. She attended peace conferences, and went to New York in 1954 to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, on behalf of the Women's International Democratic Federation. In 1958 she organized the Women's Caravan of Peace, a group of women who travelled across Europe to Moscow and back, protesting against nuclear weapons and calling for total disarmament, with the banner &#145;women of all lands want peace&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1962 Dora returned to Cornwall, to Carn Foel, Porthcurno, the house she and Russell had bought in 1922. She devoted most of her time to writing, and to the care of her son John, who had had a mental breakdown in 1954. She continued to campaign for peace, leading a London Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally in a wheelchair at the age of eighty-nine, and just before her death she took part in an anti-nuclear demonstration at the Royal Air Force base at St Mawgan, Cornwall. Dora Russell died on 31 May 1986 at home in Porthcurno. She was cremated at Penmount crematorium, Truro, on 9 June and her ashes were scattered in her garden at Carn Foel. She had four children, one son and one daughter from her first marriage, and one son and one daughter with Griffin Barry. The younger son was injured in a mining accident in 1952 and was an invalid until his death in 1983.<br>
<br>Dora Russell loved campaigning, enjoying public speaking&#151;she had always wanted to be an actress&#151;and writing letters to the press. A chain-smoker, she was small, red-haired, and untidy, and claimed to have been one of the first women in England to wear shorts, in the 1920s. Throughout her life she campaigned for sexual freedom for women. She believed passionately that hope for the future lay in women. Many of her ideas anticipated those of the feminist movement of the 1970s and 1980s.<br>
