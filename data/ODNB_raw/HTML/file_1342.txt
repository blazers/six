<span class="headword">Barclay,  John</span>  (1582&#150;1621), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 28 January 1582 at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, Lorraine, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1352/', "William Barclay (1546&#150;1608)")</script> and his wife, Anne de Malleviller. His father was Scottish, and professor of civil law in the college recently founded in Pont-&agrave;-Mousson by the duke of Lorraine; his mother was native to Lorraine. Despite his place of birth and upbringing, and even though there is no record of his ever visiting Scotland, Barclay seems to have been proud of his Scottish ancestry and to have valued his allegiance to James VI and I. However, during Barclay's residence in England, state records consistently refer to him as French, and make little or no reference to his Scottish parentage.<br>
<br>Barclay was educated at the Jesuit school in Pont-&agrave;-Mousson until about 1602; he may also have tried the noviciate, but either because he was unsuited or because of his father's quarrel with the order and resignation from his post, in the end Barclay did not join. Instead, he developed an antipathy to Jesuit modes of education and recruitment, which he satirizes in his <span class="italic">Satyricon</span> (1605). At the age of nineteen Barclay had published his first work, <span class="italic">In P. Statii Papini Thebaidii libros III commentarii et in totidem sequentes notae</span> (Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, 1601) a commentary on Statius's <span class="italic">Thebaid</span>. It was the beginning of a distinguished literary career, which would bring him fame all over western Europe.<br>
<br>Barclay's movements between 1602 and 1606 are uncertain, although he may have attended his father in Paris. During this period, probably in 1605, he married Louise Debonnaire (<i>c</i>.1585&#150;1652), the daughter of an army paymaster, with whom he had two daughters and a son. During the same time he published the first part of <span class="italic">Euphormionis lusinini satyricon</span> (Paris, 1605; reports of an earlier edition in London in 1603 seem to be unfounded), a Menippean satire modelled on Petronius's <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>. Barclay's choice of model was a first in Renaissance Latin writing and his version was as irreverent as the original. Barclay's <span class="italic">Satyricon</span> is the story of Euphormio, a citizen of an ideal realm who arrives in seventeenth-century Europe, and his adventures therein. Almost as soon as it was published, keys appeared to interpret the characters and locations depicted in it. Barclay did not produce any keys himself, only an apology for some of the associations (<span class="italic">Apologia pro se</span>, sometimes identified as the third part of the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>, first published in Paris in 1610), and the interpretations of his satire are diverse. Of the references agreed by most authorities, two stand out: James VI as Neptune, a benevolent and powerful figure, and Acignius as the Jesuits. Although Euphormio is generally held to be a figure of Barclay, the extravagance of the character's adventures argue against a directly autobiographical reading. The second part of the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>, containing further adventures of Euphormio, appeared in Paris in 1607. The work was very popular, the first part running to six and the second to five editions within Barclay's lifetime. Its popularity continued into the vernacular, and by the eighteenth century the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span> had been translated into French, German, and Dutch. Its attraction is a combination of speculation as to the correct interpretation of the figures within the narrative and delight in the comic misadventures of Euphormio. The work was Barclay's first great literary success, and its dedication to James VI and I doubtless helped his progress at the British court.<br>
<br>By 1606 the family was in England, where Barclay sought favour at the Jacobean court. He had already written <span class="italic">Regi Jacobo Primo, carmen gratulatorium</span> (Paris, 1603) to congratulate James on his accession to the English throne, and he continued his practice of literary flattery in a number of other works, such as <span class="italic">Sylvae</span> (1606), a collection of poems addressed to James and to some of his courtiers. Much of Barclay's quest for royal favour seems to have been channelled through Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, for there are records of Barclay sending laudatory verses to Salisbury in 1606 and of William Barclay writing to him on his son's behalf in 1607. Such approaches were evidently successful, for several times Barclay appears to have been paid a pension by Salisbury, who was later reimbursed by the king.<br>
<br>While at court Barclay took on a variety of literary tasks. He maintained his satirical edge in <span class="italic">Icon animorum</span> (1614), which sometimes appears as the fourth part of the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>, but which in fact is a collection of sketches of the characters of nations. He also diversified by writing a directly political work, the <span class="italic">Series patefacti divinitus parricidii inter maximum regum regnumque Britanniae cogitati et instructi</span> (1605), a commentary on the Gunpowder Plot, and then undertook the editing and publishing of a work by his father, <span class="italic">De potestate papae</span> (1609), which argues for the pope's disqualification from secular power. Both of these were designed to appeal to James, and Barclay became involved in one of the king's own literary projects. On 27 April 1609 Barclay was rewarded for his translation work on the &#145;king's book&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1603&#150;10</i>, 506); this book was presumably <span class="italic">Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance</span>, published first in 1607&#150;8 and then in a revised version in 1609. A month later Barclay, together with the Scottish poet Robert Aytoun, received &pound;300 for &#145;expenses on their journey with His Majestie's letters to divers foreign princes&#146;  (ibid., 514, 591). Among these letters seems to have been included a copy of the &#145;king's book&#146;, which Barclay carried to the magnates of Lorraine, Bavaria, and Savoy. On his return from this mission, Barclay continued to enjoy royal favour: not only did James award him a new pension of &pound;200 in 1610, but later the same year he also intervened to ask the French king to suppress an attack made by Bellarmine on <span class="italic">De potestate papae</span>.<br>
<br>Despite these signs of royal favour Barclay left England for the papal court in 1615. In the preface to <span class="italic">Paranesis ad sectarios</span> (Rome, 1617), a piece of Catholic apologetics, he says he left England to allow his children to remain Catholic, and the English court may have become less welcoming to Roman Catholics during the 1610s. It is also possible that his place there was not financially secure, since a letter survives to Salisbury from Barclay in 1611, then in Paris, asking that his pension still be paid. His final departure from James's court was not without its scandal, for it was believed&#151;wrongly&#151;that he had written a book against James, such that could only have been composed by an intimate. The preface to <span class="italic">Paranesis</span> may have been written in part to defend himself, but it was not until 1618 that the true author of the book in question was revealed as a lecturer at the University of Louvain.<br>
<br>In Rome Barclay undertook his greatest work, the <span class="italic">Argenis</span>. It was published posthumously in Paris in 1621 and dedicated to Louis XIII of France, suggesting that even then Barclay was seeking a new sponsor. It is a romance written in Latin centred on Argenis, an ideal princess, with three suitors, one good, one bad, and one who is finally recognized as her long-lost brother. It is also an allegory of seventeenth-century Europe, and keys for its characters also survive, for example identifying Archombrotus and Poliarchus as figures of Henry IV, Hyanisbe of Elizabeth I, and Radirobanes of Philip II. In contrast to the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>, however, there is no character that can be identified as a type of Barclay himself. Like the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span>, the <span class="italic">Argenis</span> was instantly popular: in London in May 1622, because of demand, the cost of a volume rose from 5<i>s</i>. to 14<i>s</i>. and James commanded Ben Jonson to translate it, although if a translation ever existed, it seems not to have been published. Other translations appeared, in many European vernaculars, and two sequels, by other hands, were also published.<br>
<br>Barclay died in Rome on 15 August 1621, a fortnight after he had fallen ill with a fever and only eighteen days after he had finished the <span class="italic">Argenis</span>. He was buried in the church of St Onofrio in Rome. His widow returned to France and died at Orl&eacute;ans in 1652. Although Barclay can be claimed as French and also as Scottish, his contribution to literature is very much international. Through his associations with the court of James VI, his place in British cultural history is assured, but his works, particularly the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span> and <span class="italic">Argenis</span>, were read all over Europe. Such works demonstrate clearly the accessibility and importance of Latin as a language of literature and culture in the seventeenth century; they also show that the response to classical literature continued to develop throughout the Renaissance.<br>
