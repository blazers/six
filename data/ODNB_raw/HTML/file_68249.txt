<span class="headword">Bargrave,  Robert</span>  (1628&#150;1661), <span class="occ">merchant and diarist</span>, was born in Kent, possibly at the family home, Eastry Court, Eastry, near Sandwich, on 25 March 1628, the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1370/', "Isaac Bargrave (bap. 1586, d. 1643)")</script>, dean of Canterbury, and his wife, Elizabeth (1593&#150;1667), daughter of John Dering and his wife, Elizabeth Wotton. Bargrave was admitted pensioner of Clare College, Cambridge, on 23 March 1642 and then matriculated from Corpus Christi, Oxford, on 10 May 1643. Both <span class="italic">Alumni Cantabrigienses</span> and <span class="italic">Alumni Oxonienses</span> accept without question that he was the Robert Bargrave who had been admitted to Gray's Inn on 14 August 1640, at the unusually young age of twelve, along with his elder brother, Thomas. If this was so, then Tilmouth speculates that it may primarily have been to take part in the inn's dramatic entertainments  (Tilmouth, 158).<br>
<br>Bargrave compiled a diary of four voyages undertaken between April 1647 and March 1656 as a merchant trading in the Levant and other Mediterranean locations  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. C 799). The first account (April 1647 to September 1652) describes his journey by sea from England to Constantinople with the entourage of the new ambassador, Sir Thomas Bendish, and his experiences as a merchant in Turkey. The second account (September 1652 to March 1653) recounts his arduous travels home overland from Turkey to England. About 1653 Bargrave married Elizabeth Turner (<i>b</i>. 1632) of Canterbury. They had four children: Robert (1654&#150;1659), Hester (<i>b</i>. 1658), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1659?), and Isaac (1660&#150;1663). Their two sons were commemorated in a pavement tablet at Canterbury Cathedral (removed in 1993 but reproduced in Cowper, 41). Bargrave's third voyage (November 1654 to February 1656) took him to Spain and then on to Venice; and his rapid progress home overland from Venice to England (February to March 1656) is described in the fourth account. Bargrave's diary records his extensive experiences of commercial and diplomatic affairs, as well as his encounters with &eacute;migr&eacute; royalists, and his relatives John Bargrave and John Raymond, who together compiled the invaluable guidebook published under the latter's name as <span class="italic">An Itinerary &hellip; Made through Italy</span> (1648). Interspersed with these travel records are examples of Bargrave's own poetry, including a masque with musical settings and dance steps, and his general observations as a tourist. Another, now lost, manuscript of these travels was at Bargrave's childhood home, Eastry Court, until at least the mid-1830s.<br>
<br>After March 1656 Bargrave was employed as personal secretary to Heneage Finch, earl of Winchilsea. Through Winchilsea's influence, Robert was nominated as clerk of the castle court at Dover. He was then appointed by the Levant Company as secretary at Constantinople, following Winchilsea's appointment as ambassador there. This latter position was one of considerable influence, requiring Bargrave to serve as chancellor of the company's factory and also to deputize for Winchilsea if he was unable to perform his ambassadorial duties through absence, illness, or death. On 20 October 1660 Winchilsea sailed from the Downs on the <i>Plymouth</i>, under the command of Thomas Allin, with Bargrave and his new private secretary, Paul Rycaut. On route to Turkey, Winchilsea's party stopped at Lisbon and Algiers and several official documents concerning these visits (now in the National Archives) were penned by Bargrave. The <i>Plymouth</i> arrived at Smyrna on 14 December and departed for Constantinople on 7 January 1661, leaving behind Bargrave who had been laid low by a severe fever. His death was reported on 9 February 1661 to Winchilsea by the English consul at Smyrna, Richard Baker: &#145;Yo<i>u</i>r serv<i>ant</i> m<sup>r</sup> Bargrave is dead &amp; buried at Santa Ven&aacute;randa whither wee all accompanied him; his wife most disconsolate &amp; to be admired for her love &amp; care of him&#146;  (Leics. RO, DG.7 Box 4982). His widow, Elizabeth, set out from Smyrna on 29 March for the return journey to England, accompanied by the retiring ambassador, Sir Thomas Bendish, with whom Bargrave had first travelled out to the Levant in 1647.<br>
