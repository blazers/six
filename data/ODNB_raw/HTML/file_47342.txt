<span class="headword">Oxenbridge,  Daniel</span>  (1571&#150;1642), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the only son of the Revd John Oxenbridge (<i>d</i>. 1618) and his wife, Mary, was born in Surrey. In the following year his father was presented to the living of Southam in Warwickshire by the Throgmorton family, who were both puritan and well-connected. He was later expelled from his rectory at Southam because of his involvement with the presbyterian movement of Thomas Cartwright, and was one of a number of Warwickshire ministers who subscribed the presbyterian <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> in 1588.<br>
<br>Daniel Oxenbridge's early years were spent in Warwickshire; he was first educated at St Peter's College, Westminster, from where he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the university in 1590 and took his BA in 1593, and MA in 1596. Any thought of following his father into the ministry vanished with the violent suppression of the presbyterian movement in the 1590s. Medicine remained a realistic alternative for many puritans, and Oxenbridge practised medicine for many years in Daventry, Northamptonshire. About 1601 he married Katherine Harby, a member of a local gentry family. They had four daughters, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1602), Dorcas, Katherine, who married the parliamentarian commander Philip Skippon, and Elizabeth, who married the prominent parliamentarian leader Oliver St John; and three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21048/', "John Oxenbridge")</script>, Daniel, and Clement. The Restoration poet Katherine Philips was Oxenbridge's granddaughter.<br>
<br>After many years in practice in Daventry, in 1620 Oxenbridge rather suddenly accumulated his MB and MD degrees at Christ Church. Soon after he moved his practice and his family to London. The need to increase his income to support his large family may have prompted the move, or it may have been due to increasing pressure from bishops on the practice of medicine by puritans. A university medical degree obviated an episcopal medical licence, while an MD from Oxford or Cambridge was also a primary qualification for a fellowship of the College of Physicians in London.<br>
<br>Oxenbridge first appeared before the college on 23 May 1623, asking for preferential treatment based on the currency of his degree, and his many years of practice before its award. Oxenbridge's advanced age was somewhat unusual in a prospective fellow, as was his extensive medical experience. However, he did not become a candidate in the college until August 1626, and was not formally elected a fellow until 22 November 1627. His tenure in the college was uneventful: he held no office, but regularly attended meetings, at which he, like all the fellows, complained about the medical malpractice observed in the City. Oxenbridge's financial contributions to the college were average; modest, too, was the house in which he and his wife lived in St Benet Sherehog parish. A tithing survey of 1638 rated the house the ninth most valuable out of the twenty-eight houses noted in the parish. A circumspect life did not, however, preclude his coming to the aid of his puritan co-religionists, which he did in 1639, when he stood surety for Peter Smart, canon of Durham, in his struggle with his Laudian fellow canon John Cosin. Oxenbridge died at his London house in St Sythe's Lane, St Benet Sherehog, on 24 August 1642. He was buried in St Benet Sherehog churchyard.<br>
<br>Oxenbridge's will of 1641 revealed that, as well as his house, he owned a number of landholdings, which he passed on to his wife, children, and grandchildren. These included lands and tenements in the most radical puritan parish in the City, St Stephen's, Coleman Street; lands in Northumberland and Bermuda; and a property called the Tynne Farm. Among the physician's other bequests were &pound;10 to his daughter Katherine Fowler, then the wife of a London merchant, and &pound;10 more to the Fowlers' daughter, Oxenbridge's granddaughter, Katherine. The anonymous <span class="italic">General Observations and Prescriptions in the Practice of Physick</span>, published in 1715, is said to have been based on Oxenbridge's casebook.<br>
