<span class="headword">Watts,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1851), <span class="occ">line-engraver</span>, was baptized on 25 March 1753 at St Leonard, Shoreditch, London, the son of William Watts, master silk weaver in Moorfields, and his wife, Hannah. In 1767, aged fourteen, he was apprenticed to the engraver Edward Rooker. He is said also to have been taught by Paul Sandby: certainly he, like Rooker, became a principal engraver of Sandby's landscapes. Watts took over Rooker's <span class="italic">Copper Plate Magazine</span> when Rooker died in 1774 and contributed largely to the series of 150 landscapes that was eventually repackaged and republished by Boydell as <span class="italic">Sandby's Views</span>. Watts's own <span class="italic">Seats of the Nobility and Gentry</span>, which he drew as well as engraved, was published in twenty-one parts between 1779 and 1786.<br>
<br>In spring 1786&#151;owing, as he told subscribers, to poor and declining health&#151;Watts curtailed the publication, sold the furniture and prints at his house at Kemp's Row, Chelsea, in July, and went to Italy, reaching Naples in September 1786. He returned about a year later to live at Sunbury, Middlesex. Health as well as work may have inspired his journeys to Carmarthen in 1789; to the Hotwells, Bristol in 1790; and in 1791 to Bath, where he spent two years. At Bath he produced a set of twelve views of the principal buildings in Bath and Bristol. <span class="italic">Thirty-Six Views in Scotland</span> appeared in two parts, 1791 and 1794.<br>
<br>A great enthusiast for the French Revolution, Watts went to Paris; there in 1793 copies of some of his views of English country seats were aquatinted and published in colour by Laurent Guyot. He invested much of his money in the French public funds, only to find his property confiscated with that of other British subjects when war broke out. Much dispirited, he returned to work, engraving three of the plates in <span class="italic">Select Views in London and Westminster</span> (1800) and sixty-five coloured plates, from drawings by Luigi Mayer, for Sir Robert Ainstie's <span class="italic">Views in Turkey in Europe and Asia</span> (1801). This was his last major publication and he retired from business to live at Mill Hill, Middlesex. He was well read, fluent in French and Italian, and his health recovered well from the exertions of the 1780s.<br>
<br>Watts was unmarried&#151;his companion &#145;Mrs Watts&#146; being, as Joseph Farington remarked from time to time, &#145;a spinster&#146;. He was survived by a natural son, William Watts, and a natural daughter, Mary, who in January 1795 married the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27866/', "Sharon Turner")</script>. He recovered some of his French investment at the peace in 1815. In 1814 he purchased a small property at Cobham, Surrey, and had been blind for some years when he died there on 7 December 1851.<br>
