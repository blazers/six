<span class="headword">Davies,  Theophilus Harris</span>  (1834&#150;1898), <span class="occ">businessman and consul</span>, was born on 4 January 1834 in Coalbournbrook, Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the second of the five children of the Revd Theophilus Davies (<i>c</i>.1798&#150;1879?), a Welsh Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>c</i>.1798&#150;1849?). By 1837 his father had moved to Ludlow, Shropshire, where he combined his ministry with private tutoring. Davies was educated by his father.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1851 Davies was employed as a bookkeeper by a relative in Manchester, the commission merchant and agent Henry Beecroft Jackson. Davies could not do the job, and after six months he was redeployed as a shipping clerk. In 1856 Jackson's associate Robert Chesshyre Janion, a Liverpool merchant and agent of the Northern Assurance Company, appointed Davies as a clerk at his Honolulu office; thus in November Davies set sail for Hawaii, where he arrived in spring 1857.<br>
<br>In 1867 Janion's partner was in severe financial difficulties, and Davies&#151;who had accumulated some capital&#151;became Janion's new partner in Hawaii. In February 1868 Davies also established his own business, Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., with which he remained involved until his death. (His business was subsequently incorporated in 1894.) It made a number of very profitable investments in Hawaii's rapidly expanding sugar industry. On 5 October 1870 his father married Davies to Mary Ellen (1849?&#150;1907), daughter of George Cocking, a Ludlow chemist and one-time mayor. They were to have five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Davies's partnership with Janion was dissolved following the latter's death in 1881. Davies retained an interest in many of the former partnership's investments, of which the most profitable was to be the Honolulu iron works. By the 1880s he had become one of the wealthiest businessmen in Hawaii. In addition to his business interests Davies found time to be treasurer of the Honolulu Cathedral building committee and to promote a Hawaiian branch of the YMCA. He also served as British vice-consul from 1872 to 1888. He acted as commissioner consul-general from 1872 to 1874 and was acting consul from 1877 to 1878. In 1888 the Hawaiian government considered appointing Davies as its consul-general in London. As a result Davies was required to resign his position of vice-consul in order to avoid a potential conflict of interest. However, King Kalakaua's dislike of Davies meant that the latter did not secure the appointment in London; none the less, Davies had already decided to retire to England that year.<br>
<br>Davies moved with his family to his new home, Sundown, in Southport, Lancashire, where he remained actively involved in the Liverpool branch of his business. During the Hawaiian political crisis of 1893&#150;8 Davies was a strong supporter of Hawaiian sovereignty; he sought to protect the interests of his god-daughter and ward, Princess Kaiulani, the heir to the Hawaiian throne; and he unsuccessfully opposed the campaign by the Republic of Hawaii for annexation to the United States.<br>
<br>During his eleven years in Southport, Davies was an active and generous philanthropist who supported in particular the borough's young men and the parish of All Saints. He became a member of the committee of the YMCA in 1887 and served as its president in 1891, 1892, and 1897. Davies also served as president of the Southport Working Lads' Club from its foundation in 1891. An active supporter of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Church Pastoral Aid Society, he was a member of the council of the Church Missionary Society, of the executive of the Church of England Temperance Society, and of the diocesan temperance committee for Liverpool. Davies supported the Conservative Party and later, in the 1890s, the Liberal Unionists. While in Southport he served as a justice of the peace. However, though he was offered the position of mayor of Southport, Davies did not seek political office. During his time both in Hawaii and in his retirement, he sought to promote both the commercial and the wider interests of the British empire. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and also a fellow of the Imperial Institute.<br>
<br>In 1897 Davies moved to his new home, Ravensdale, in Pembury Road, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, because of his wife's poor health. His philanthropy and parochial work was transferred to the Tunbridge Wells parishes of Trinity and St James. Davies died after a winter visit to Honolulu. He caught a cold that led to his death, at Ravensdale, from what may have been typhoid fever or cholera on 25 May 1898. He was buried in the Tunbridge Wells new cemetery on 27 May. He died a very wealthy man, with real estate in Britain, Canada, and Hawaii, as well as investments in Hawaiian, European, Indian, and Canadian stocks and bonds.<br>
