<span class="headword">Widdrington,  William</span>, fourth Baron Widdrington  (1677/8&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Jacobite leader</span>, was the son of William Widdrington, third baron (1656&#150;1695), and Alathea Fairfax (<i>fl</i>. 1677&#150;1694), daughter and heir of Charles, fifth Viscount Fairfax of Emley, Yorkshire. He had a staunch Roman Catholic and royalist ancestry. The first baron, his great-grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29359/', "William Widdrington")</script>, was a royalist army officer who was killed at the battle of Wigan (1651). His grandfather served in the army of Charles II, and at the revolution of 1688 his father was dismissed as governor of Berwick and Holy Island and briefly imprisoned. He was kept under surveillance as a likely participant in Jacobite intrigue, but he shortly went into self-imposed exile on the continent, where he died in 1695. He left three sons, William, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1756), and Peregrine (<i>d</i>. 1749), all of whom became active Jacobites. William, the fourth baron, was educated at Morpeth grammar school and at the Jesuit Coll&egrave;ge Louis-le-Grand in Paris, and he became familiar at the Stuart court at St Germain. In 1700 he married Jane Tempest (<i>d</i>. 1714), daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Tempest, bt, of Stella Hall, co. Durham, a flourishing Tyneside coaling estate, where he lived because Widdrington Castle, his ancestral seat on the Northumbrian coast, was sacked during a French raid in 1691. He had a rent roll of some &pound;4000 a year and became a leading figure in local Roman Catholic and tory&#150;Jacobite circles, though he did not intervene in local politics or in elections. He was a keen country sportsman and enjoyed a reputation for generous hospitality. His wife died on 9 September 1714 leaving three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Widdrington took a leading part in the planning of the northern contribution to the Jacobite rising of 1715. He was passed over for general command because of his Roman Catholicism; he had no military experience or expertise, in any case, but he provided one of the five troops in the Northumbrian Jacobite force, and his brothers Charles and Peregrine joined him in arms. He instigated the plan to transfer operations to the north-west when the planned seizure of Newcastle was thwarted, and he effected the liaison with the Lancastrian Jacobites through his family connections. He was confined to his bed with gout during the action at Preston, and when it was clear that the situation was hopeless he advised Thomas Forster to capitulate. He was tried for high treason by the House of Lords on 19 January 1716. In his defence he maintained that he was not privy to the plan; he had joined hastily and rashly only to keep face with his friends; he had appeared with personal arms only; and he was the first to propose a surrender. He also asked that the plight of his five motherless children be considered. He was found guilty and was sentenced to death, but with only hours to spare he was reprieved at the intervention, it was said, of Lord Carlisle and Lady Cowper, the lord chancellor's wife and a Northumbrian. He and his brothers were released from the Tower in November 1717 under the <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> (3 Geo. I c. 19), but the forfeiture of his estates and the attainder on his barony were not lifted. Peregrine remained in London and, from 1732, lived at Chiswick with Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sherburne, widow of the eighth duke of Norfolk, without benefit of clergy (indeed, she dismissed her chaplain, Thomas Lawson SJ, for his effrontery in querying their marital status). Charles went abroad and died at St Omer in 1756.<br>
<br>In July 1718 Widdrington married Catherine Graham (1677&#150;1757), daughter (and coheir in 1739) of Richard Graham, Viscount Preston, of Nunnington Hall, North Riding of Yorkshire, and granddaughter of Lord Carlisle. In 1719, although the king had no objection, the Commons rejected his petition for an annual allowance of &pound;700 from his late wife's estate to support himself and his &#145;distressed family&#146;. In 1723 (by 9 Geo. I c. 19, s. 13) he was granted &pound;12,000 from the sale of his estates; in 1733 he successfully petitioned for the restitution of his marital estates. In 1728 Roger Gale described him as &#145;an infirm valetudinarian&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Family Memoirs of the Rev. W. Stukely</span>, SurtS, 73, 1882, 200). He died at Bath on 19 April 1743, aged sixty-five, and was buried at Nunnington; his widow erected an impressive memorial by James Gibbs to him in the parish church. She died childless in 1757. Notwithstanding the extinction of the title, Henry Francis (1701&#150;1774), his eldest son, was commonly called Lord Widdrington by his fellow Catholics, thus confusing the obituarists at his death in 1774. The Durham estates passed to his nephew, Thomas Eyre of Hassop, and thus out of the family.<br>
