<span class="headword">Bastian,  (Henry) Charlton</span>  (1837&#150;1915), <span class="occ">physician and neurologist</span>, was born on 26 April 1837 in Truro, Cornwall, the third son in a family of four sons and one daughter of James Bastian, merchant, and his wife, Charlotte Eliza Bullmore. After attending school in Falmouth he entered University College, London, in 1856, and graduated BA (1859), MA (1861), MB (1863), and MD (1866). He became MRCS (1860), MRCP (1865), and FRCP (1870). In 1866 he married Julia Augusta, third daughter of Charles Orme, brewer, of 81 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London; they were to have three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Charlton Bastian first worked in London at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, as assistant physician and lecturer in pathology. He returned to University College as professor of pathological anatomy in 1867, and became a physician to University College Hospital in 1878. He also held another senior post, as physician in nervous diseases at the National Hospital, Queen Square, from 1868 to 1902. He held the chair of medicine at University College Hospital from 1887 to 1898. Bastian served as a censor of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1897&#150;8) and later received an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and an honorary MD degree from the Royal University of Ireland.<br>
<br>As a child Bastian was fascinated by natural history, and among his early publications was a complete flora of Falmouth and a collection of the ferns of Great Britain. He was an authority on free nematode worms and named 100 new species in his monograph <span class="italic">The Anguillulidae</span> in 1864. He was elected FRS for this work in 1868, at the age of thirty-one, but had to abandon this interest when he developed an allergy to the worms. He was a strong supporter of the theory of evolution and numbered Herbert Spencer among his lifelong friends. His reputation in medicine was made in the late 1860s by his neurological studies of aphasias and other speech disorders. His standing in medicine was not harmed when he became the British champion of &#145;spontaneous generation of life&#146; and a leading opponent of the germ theory of disease. However, as support for spontaneous generation faded and germ theory gained more supporters in the medical profession, Bastian's star waned. He found himself confronting many of the leading scientists and clinicians of the day, including Thomas Huxley, John Tyndall, Joseph Lister, and Louis Pasteur. One of the great paradoxes of Bastian's work is that in neurology his views were highly conventional, while in biology, and what became bacteriology, they became unorthodox and eventually eccentric. However, Bastian would maintain that he followed the evidence as he saw it and avoided metaphysics.<br>
<br>Bastian's first major publication in neurology was about the identification of a degenerated tract in the spinal cord, which was later named after Sir William Gowers (whose investigation was more definitive). In 1869 he published a seminal paper on various forms of speech loss and their relation to cerebral disease. Wernicke's sensory aphasia&#151;a form of word deafness which was again later identified with another doctor&#151;was initially described by Bastian. His approach to the understanding of aphasias was based on the idea that independent centres in the brain controlled speech and vision. His views on localization in mental functioning were set out in <span class="italic">The Brain as an Organ of Mind</span> (1880), <span class="italic">On Paralyses: Cerebral, Bulbar and Spinal</span> (1886), and <span class="italic">On Various Forms of Hysterical or Functional Paralysis</span> (1893). His classic <span class="italic">Treatise on Aphasia and other Speech Disorders</span> (1898) was based on his Lumleian lectures and was translated into Italian and German.<br>
<br>Bastian regarded his true life's work and achievement as the studies he made on the origins of life, despite the opprobrium this brought him. His views on this subject first came to light in the late 1860s when he defended the doctrine of spontaneous generation by both logic and experiment. Mainstream biological opinion assumed that life always came from life&#151;<i>omne vivum ex ovo</i>&#151;and that the actual origins of life, if not the creation of life, occurred at some distant time. Darwin, despite choosing the title <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span> for his main work on evolution, avoided consideration of the first origin of life and only sought to explain how existing species transmute into other species. None the less, both Darwin and Wallace found Bastian's ideas interesting, for if scientists accepted that life had originated once from non-living matter, then it was illogical to deny that this process might still be occurring. All the more so, when no one knew in what conditions life had first appeared. However, Huxley and other leading Darwinians regarded Bastian's views as unnecessarily contentious and he was ostracized for damaging the cause of evolution.<br>
<br>In the 1870s the British debate about spontaneous generation was fought in public over the experimental demonstrations of the phenomenon and the standing of the germ theory of disease. Bastian's main opponent was John Tyndall, who gathered increasing support across the scientific community and in the late 1870s enlisted none other than Pasteur in the cause. Bastian mostly fought alone, though he enjoyed the tacit support of many doctors who thought that germs were the result rather than the cause of infectious and septic diseases. With hindsight, it is clear that Bastian's challenges to what became a consensus on the continuity of life and the bacterial causes of disease helped to shape the new orthodoxy. His work led others to the recognition that certain bacteria could survive boiling and to improved sterilization procedures in bacteriological research. Bastian regularly defended his unfashionable views at scientific and medical meetings, and he published extensively. He completed three books on the subject in the 1870s: <span class="italic">The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms</span> (1871), <span class="italic">The Beginnings of Life</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">Evolution and the Origin of Life</span> (1874). Quite suddenly, in 1878, Bastian gave up his fight. The main reason was the pressure of his clinical work, though few would have enjoyed the lonely pursuit of what had quickly become unfashionable views.<br>
<br>Bastian had not, however, altered his convictions, and on his retirement in 1900 he returned to the question of the origin of life with undiminished energy. He published four further monographs: <span class="italic">Studies in Heterogenesis</span> (1901&#150;4), <span class="italic">The Nature and Origin of Living Matter</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Evolution of Life</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">The Origin of Life</span> (1911). By this time his views were quite heterodox and he found it difficult to publish his work in mainstream journals. Bastian died at his home, Fairfield, Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, on 17 November 1915. He was survived by his wife. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
