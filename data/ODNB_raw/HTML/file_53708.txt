<span class="headword">Cappel,  Aaron</span>  (1560&#150;1620), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born on 9 October 1560 in London, the son of Anthoine Cappel, an immigrant silkweaver who had arrived from Antwerp in 1559, and who went on to be one of the first and longest-serving elders of the French church of London, and his wife, Barbara. Cappel was a pensioner at Peterhouse, Cambridge, from an unknown date until 1581, and then went on to study at Geneva from 1583 to 1585, funded by the French church of London, to which he had promised his services upon the completion of his studies. He spent a few more years on the continent, studying at Heidelberg in 1586, but was recalled by the French church of London in September 1590. On 28 May 1591 he was accepted as a full minister of the church, joining Robert le Ma&ccedil;on de la Fontaine and Jean Castol. On 10 October that year he married, in the French church of Canterbury, Esther (or Hester) Maurois, the daughter of one of the elders of that church. He also had connections with the other principal Francophone refugee church in England, in Norwich, which he temporarily served as minister from November 1597 to June 1598.<br>
<br>As a pastor, Cappel gained the approval of Isaac Casaubon for his theology and preaching. Outside the immediate concerns of his own church, he was involved in larger protestant causes through his friendship and correspondence with Andrew Melville, the Scottish presbyterian leader. He supported in England the request of the Huguenot grandee the duc de Bouillon to have Melville freed from the Tower of London to take up a position at the Academy of Sedan. In a letter of 1611, after he had finally been permitted to go to Sedan, Melville commented in passing on this friendship to his son James, writing, &#145;The excellent Cappel has in the most friendly manner recommended you by letter to the Duke of Bouillon, but has as yet received no answer. &hellip; In the mean time write to me frequently by Cappel concerning every thing&#146;  (M'Crie, 1.275).<br>
<br>Cappel died in 1620, and was buried in his London parish of St Katharine Coleman on 1 February, survived by his wife, Esther (who was still living in January 1626), and several of his children, including Aaron (<i>d</i>. 1625) and Hester (<i>d</i>. after 1645).<br>
