<span class="headword">Mary</span> <span class="st"> [Mary of Modena]</span>  (1658&#150;1718), <span class="occ">queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland, consort of James II and VII</span>, was born Maria Beatrice Anna Margherita Isabella d'Este on 25 September/5 October 1658 at the Palazzo Ducale, Modena, Italy, the first of two surviving children of Alfonso IV d'Este, duke of Modena and Reggio (1634&#150;1662), and his wife, Laura (1639&#150;1687), daughter of Giralamo Martinozzi and his wife, Margherita Mazarini. Through her maternal grandmother Mary Beatrice was a great-niece of Cardinal Mazarin. On the death of her father on 6/16 July 1662 and the succession of her infant brother, Francesco II, to the dukedom, her mother became regent of the duchy and her uncle, Prince Rinaldo d'Este, her joint guardian. Her education was entrusted to the nuns of the local Carmelite convent. She later recalled with pleasure the summers she had spent at d'Este's summer palace of Sassuolo. The family was well aware that a marriageable daughter was a potential diplomatic bonus. Following the death of Henrietta, duchess of Orl&eacute;ans, in 1670, Mary Beatrice's great-uncle Cardinal d'Este hinted to Cardinal d'Estr&eacute;es that she might make a suitable second wife for Orl&eacute;ans. Even so, there was an assumption that she would probably enter the local Convent of the Visitation and she herself believed that she had a vocation.<h2>
<a name="Marriage1673"></a>Marriage, 1673</h2>The future of the young Mary Beatrice was transformed by the death of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "James")</script>, duke of York's first duchess, Anne Hyde, in March 1671. York's wish to remarry was a matter of the utmost dynastic importance. The growing likelihood that Charles II's wife, Catherine of Braganza, would never bear any children made it ever more probable that any surviving son born to York's future wife would eventually inherit the British throne. That the newly converted York was determined to choose a Catholic bride meant that the marriage was bound to be controversial. His groom of the stole, the second earl of Peterborough, was appointed to investigate the various candidates. Klaudia Felizitas, daughter of the late Archduke Ferdinand Karl of the Tyrol (who instead married Emperor Leopold I); Marie Anna of W&uuml;rttemberg, daughter of Prince Ulrich of Neuenburg; Elizabeth, widow of Louis Joseph, duc de Lorraine-Guise; and Eleonore Magdalene, daughter of the elector palatine of Pfalz Neuburg (and Leopold I's future third wife), were among the possibilities considered.<br>
<br>Peterborough, on the advice of the Modenese representative in Paris, Abb&eacute; Rizzini, instead favoured Mary Beatrice, a choice which was also acceptable to Louis XIV. Initial indications from Modena were, however, unfavourable, either because the intention was to honour her wish to enter a convent or, more probably, because the king of Spain, Carlos II, was preferred as a bridegroom. Her aunt Leonora, sister of Alfonso IV, was promoted as one possible alternative bride for York and Mary Beatrice bluntly told Peterborough when she first met him that she would prefer to become a nun. In the end pressure applied by the French government in the person of the marquis de Dangeau persuaded the Duchess Laura to capitulate. The decision distressed her daughter who cried for several days on being informed of her fate. Several problems remained. Another of the bride's great-uncles, Cardinal Barberini, lobbied the pope, Clement X, for a dispensation to allow her to marry someone who had not yet publicly declared himself a Catholic, but objections were raised as to whether Mary Beatrice would be able to worship in public and about whether any children would be brought up as Catholics, and the pope recalled the dispensation at the last minute. The Modenese decided to proceed anyway, although the bishop of Modena refused to officiate. The wedding took place on 20/30 September 1673 in the Palazzo Ducale with Peterborough standing in as proxy for York. The new duchess set out for England five days later, her fifteenth birthday, accompanied by her mother and Prince Rinaldo.<br>
<br>What diplomatic importance the dukes of Modena enjoyed was as the traditional pro-French counterweight to the papacy in central Italy and it was understood by everyone that the marriage reinforced Charles II's alliance with Louis XIV. This made the match all the more unpopular in England. The House of Commons presented a protest to Charles II on 3 November 1673 asking him to cancel the marriage and the Fifth of November commemorations in London that year were much larger than usual. These protests were ignored on the grounds that the marriage had already taken place and suggestions that Mary Beatrice should delay her arrival were rejected.<br>
<br>The bride landed at Dover on 21 November and was greeted on the beach by her new husband. That evening, in the presence of the bride and groom, Bishop Crewe of Oxford formally acknowledged the validity of the ceremony which had taken place in Modena. Five days later the couple sailed up the Thames to Whitehall. The reception there was marred when a number of peeresses objected to the king's offer of a chair to the new duchess of York's mother. Such disputes over the right to sit in the royal presence often occurred during the visits of foreign royalty, but on this occasion the protest seemed designed to cast aspersions on the marriage, for the implication was that the Duchess Laura was not royalty and that York had once again married beneath himself. The incident embarrassed the duchess, who cut short her stay in England.<br>
<br>Mary Beatrice was never considered a great beauty. In this respect, her most striking feature, her long, narrow face, was a disadvantage. Shortly before her arrival in England, Peterborough's nephew, Henry, Lord O'Brien, joked that parliament planned to reward his uncle by granting him a pair of spectacles. Those who distrusted her for political reasons were quick to criticize her appearance. Others were more positive. The third Viscount Conway thought that she was:<blockquote>a proper hansome Lady, she hath very good eyes, very good features, and a very good complexion, but she wants the Aire which should sett off all this, and having been bred in a Monastry, knows not how to set one foot before another with any gracefulnesse. (<span class="italic">Conway Letters</span>, ed. M. H. Nicolson and S. Hutton [1930], rev. edn, 1992, 376)</blockquote>When she visited Cambridge in 1680 she was considered to be &#145;a very handsome, gracious looking person, pretty tall, not very big, black eyed, something pale-faced and a little outlandish-like swarthy colour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Samuel Newton</span>, ed. J. E. Foster, 1890, 80). Similar comments were made five years later by the marquis d'Auvers who described her as tall and well proportioned, with a white complexion, beautiful eyes, and a mouth which was a little too large. The person least concerned by any shortcomings in her appearance was perhaps her husband, who had a reputation for choosing his mistresses for their personalities rather than their beauty. What he really wanted from his new wife was an heir.<h2>
<a name="DuchessofYork16731685"></a>Duchess of York, 1673&#150;1685</h2>Mary Beatrice soon settled into her new life at the English court. Charles II and Queen Catherine made her feel welcome and she got on well with her two stepdaughters, the elder of whom, Princess Mary, was only four years younger than she was. The countess of Peterborough was appointed as her groom of the stole as a reward to her husband for his efforts as royal matchmaker, and a number of her Italian servants were allowed to remain in the duchess's service. The one restriction placed on her was that, unlike Queen Catherine, she was required to conduct her religious devotions in private. This contravened the marriage treaty but, as her husband had still not publicly acknowledged his conversion, this had some advantages because the two of them were therefore able to attend private services together in her closet chapel. She was permitted the handful of Catholic priests she needed for that purpose.<br>
<br>There was no doubt that the duchess was fertile. The rate of her pregnancies during the first eleven years of her marriage bears comparison with the more celebrated fertility of her younger stepdaughter. As with Princess Anne, the problem was that the pregnancies ended in miscarriage or that the children were short-lived. A miscarriage in May 1674 was followed by the birth of a daughter on 9 January 1675. Much to Charles II's annoyance, the child was baptized Catherina Laura in secret by the duchess's Jesuit chaplain, Antonio Galli. The king insisted on a second Anglican baptism and all three of the later children born before 1685 had to be baptized as protestants. Mary Beatrice again miscarried on 14 May 1675 but became pregnant almost immediately, only to lose that child on 4 October in her shock at the death of Catherina Laura the previous day. A second daughter, Isabella, was born on 28 August 1676 and she survived until 1681. Moreover, on 7 November 1677, just three days after Princess Mary had married the prince of Orange, Mary Beatrice was delivered of the longed-for son. He was baptized Charles and granted the dukedom of Cambridge. For the next five weeks it seemed as if Princess Mary's marriage might, after all, prove to be of only secondary importance. The infant duke, however, died on 12 December.<br>
<br>For the time being Mary Beatrice was largely sheltered from political controversy. Burnet believed that she avoided any involvement in public affairs while her husband remained duke of York  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.43). It was instead those around the duchess who caused problems. Her French Jesuit confessor, Pierre de Saint-Germain, was forced to flee to France in November 1675 when he was accused of attacking another French priest, Hippolite Chastelet, alias de Luzancy, who had taken refuge in England after deciding to become a protestant. Her secretary, Edward Colman, had to be dismissed in December 1676 after he was caught leaking military secrets.<br>
<br>It was, however, always going to be only a matter of time before the duchess's life was thrown into confusion by a more substantial anti-Catholic panic. Any political moves against Catholics had to be seen as a potential threat to York and his wife, but what was not predictable was the series of revelations, deceits, and coincidences which conjured up the Popish Plot of 1678. This time bad luck, together with the resolve of their political opponents, came close to ruining them both. The seizure of Colman's papers on 29 September 1678 replaced the unsubstantiated allegations of Titus Oates with hard facts. As it happened, Mary Beatrice had already planned a trip to the Netherlands to visit Princess Mary. She and Princess Anne set out on 1 October and did not return until 16 October. The earl of Ossory accompanied them in order to brief the prince of Orange on the true nature of Oates's evidence. In Mary Beatrice's absence the full implications of Colman's letters became apparent, but the assumption that she and her husband must have known what Colman had been doing was to be the least imaginative part of the emerging conspiracy theory. It was also unfair. Colman's position as the duchess's secretary had been entirely nominal and the job had remained unfilled after his dismissal. The only definite secrets about Mary Beatrice that came to light in his papers were that she had used the disgraced Father Saint-Germain as a contact at the French court during the first half of 1676 to seek support for the proposal that her uncle should become a cardinal and to press the case of the English Carmelites at Antwerp who wished to move to Lille. Mary Beatrice's involvement in the broader conspiracy was often implied by York's critics but was one line of speculation which remained undeveloped. The duchess's absence in the Netherlands also provided her with the perfect alibi against any direct complicity in the death of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey and by late December the evidence of Miles Prance had shifted attention to the supposed involvement in the plot by Catholic members of the queen's household.<br>
<br>When the new parliament met in March 1679, Charles II decided that it would be better if the duke and duchess left the country. They reached Brussels on 17/27 March and took up residence at the H&ocirc;tel de Bassigny, the house of the prince de Ligne. Three months later Mary Beatrice expressed disappointment that the trial of the five Catholic peers accused of complicity in the plot had been postponed, as she thought that they would each have been acquitted. She correctly foresaw that the dissolution of the 1679 parliament would not remove her husband's problems. Letters of denization were granted to her by the king on 24 September 1679 so that deeds confirming her jointure could be sealed on 26 and 27 September. This was intended to clarify her legal status at a time when her husband's future was uncertain. In the following month she and her husband were recalled to London, but almost immediately they were sent to Scotland. They arrived in Edinburgh on 24 November and held court at the palace of Holyroodhouse. Their return to England in February 1680 turned out to be only temporary, as the decision to allow parliament to assemble in October 1680 made it necessary for them to return to Scotland. This second Scottish exile was to be even longer than the first. On 2 March 1681, in Mary Beatrice's absence, her daughter, Isabella, died at St James's. By November 1681 she knew that she was pregnant once more, although she came close to another miscarriage on 16 December when she had, in the words of her physician, William Waldegrave, a &#145;dangerous fall&#146; while out riding  (Cambs. AS, R.51.17.31). Her expectant condition was one reason why she and James were allowed to leave Scotland in May 1682. Her mother visited England in order to be present at the birth. A daughter, Charlotte Maria, was born on the morning of 15 August 1682 but she lived only until 6 October. Mary Beatrice suffered two further miscarriages in October 1683 and on 8 May 1684. She was therefore childless when she became queen on the death of Charles II on 6 February 1685.<h2>
<a name="Queen16851688"></a>Queen, 1685&#150;1688</h2>No English queen consort in living memory had conformed to the Church of England but what made Mary Beatrice's position different was that her husband also openly acknowledged that he was a Catholic. The two of them attended mass in public for the first time on 15 February 1685. Despite the fact that it was a protestant ceremony, Mary Beatrice was crowned along with her husband in Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685, becoming the first consort since 1603 to participate in a coronation. The frame of her coronation crown survives in the collections of the Museum of London, while her diadem, state crown, sceptre, and ivory rod remain part of the crown jewels. She seems to have adjusted well to her new role. John Evelyn noted with approval in July 1686 that &#145;her outward affability [had] much changed to statelinesse &amp;c. since she has ben exalted&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.519). She remained in good health, although she did receive minor injuries in another riding accident in October 1685 and she suffered a bout of shingles in April 1686.<br>
<br>The major reorganization which James imposed throughout his own household did not extend to that of his wife. Her household was modelled on that which had been provided for Catherine of Braganza and, before her, for Henrietta Maria. Comparable financial arrangements were also made to meet its costs. Revenues from the Post Office (almost &pound;20,000), the excise on beer (&pound;18,000), her lands, and other sources gave her an annual income of about &pound;40,000. In the event this income was not quite sufficient as her actual expenditure reached almost &pound;50,000. She was therefore granted a further &pound;10,000 in December 1686 in the form of an official annuity to cover the difference. It was agreed that these payments would be continued as her jointure after James's death. The death of her maternal grandmother, Margherita Martinozzi, in June 1685 brought her some property in Italy. She also benefited from her husband's building projects at Whitehall. In May 1685 work began on a range of new state apartments for her and these were ready by 1687. In the following year attention shifted to her privy apartments, which were rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren as the dominant feature on the palace's river frontage. Mary Beatrice, however, never got the chance to occupy them as they were not quite finished when she fled the country. In January 1686, in the absence of a prince of Wales, she was granted St James's Palace.<br>
<br>Contemporaries almost certainly overestimated Mary Beatrice's role in policy-making. The duke of Monmouth's attempts to use her influence to save himself from the block came to nothing. Her subsequent request to be granted 100 of his supporters who were due to be transported to the West Indies, in order to collect the money made from their sale as indentured labour, has often been condemned. Seen from her point of view, however, the request could hardly seem callous as the deal was a purely financial transaction which made no practical difference to the prisoners themselves. Her principal concern during the first half of the reign was to persuade Pope Innocent XI to elevate her uncle Prince Rinaldo to the cardinalate. This request was granted on 23 August/2 September 1686. In November 1687 James disregarded her advice that it would be unwise to appoint his Catholic clerk of the closet, Edward Petre, to the privy council. Her secretary, John Caryll, claimed that she was also overruled when she tried to dissuade her husband from removing Cardinal Howard as cardinal-protector of England in order to appoint the new Cardinal d'Este to that position. Even so, the general fear was that she herself or those around her might use her position to meddle in politics, particularly that she might do so to support the Catholic interest. Her stepdaughter Princess Anne made it clear to her sister, the princess of Orange, that she was unconvinced that the queen could not be manipulated:<blockquote>The Queen, you must know, is of a very proud, haughty humour, and though she pretends to hate all forms and ceremony, yet one sees that those that make their court this way, are very well thought of. She declares always that she loves sincerity and hates flattery, but when the grossest flattery in the world is said to her face, she seems extremely well pleased with it. It really is enough to turn one's stomach to hear what things are said to her of this kind, and to see how mightily she is satisfied with it. (<span class="italic">Letters and Diplomatic Instructions</span>, 30&#150;31)</blockquote>A number of courtiers, most notably the two Catholic converts the earl of Sunderland and the earl of Melfort, exploited this weakness to charm their way into her favour, although in both cases this was only a secondary factor in the influence they were able to exercise over the king. The Catholic earl of Dumbarton gained his position as a gentleman of the bedchamber in July 1687 in part because of the queen's backing. What complicated the question of Mary Beatrice's potential influence was her disapproval of the king's continuing affair with Catherine Sedley. The banishment of the new countess of Dorchester in early 1686 was a temporary victory for the queen, but this incident was the most obvious indication that the marriage was not an entirely happy one.<br>
<br>News of the death of Mary Beatrice's mother at Rome on 9/19 July 1687 reached London by 26 July and six months of official court mourning commenced five days later. One of the duchess of Modena's final acts had been to visit Loreto to pray that her daughter might produce a male heir and the progresses of the king and queen that summer had been planned with the same aspiration in mind. While James made his own pilgrimage to Holywell his wife remained at Bath to take the waters in the hope that both undertakings would aid the conception of a son. These measures appeared to work: the future prince of Wales was probably conceived shortly after James had been reunited with Mary Beatrice at the end of his progress.<br>
<br>In late November 1687 the first rumours of the queen's pregnancy began to circulate. An official announcement confirming the fact was made on 23 December. Days of thanksgiving were held on 15 January 1688 in London and on 29 January elsewhere. Unfortunately these public celebrations were out of step with the unease felt by most of the king's protestant subjects. The implications of a surviving Catholic male heir were obvious to all. The more paranoid took refuge in claims of popish deception in high places. The rumours that the birth would be faked, which had first circulated in 1682 when she was pregnant with Charlotte Maria, were recycled. By the middle of March 1688 Princess Anne was already claiming in private that these suspicions seemed well founded. Her main misgiving was that the queen seemed too healthy. The original intention was that the birth would take place at Windsor, mainly because that was where the court usually spent the summer. The date on which the queen intended to move there, 15 June, would in any case have been too late, but the change of plan was used by those who wished to create a mystery about these events. The queen had decided that she would stay at St James's, which was still her principal residence, and it was there that she went into labour on the morning of 10 June 1688. A son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14594/', "James Francis Edward")</script>, was born shortly before 10 a.m. after a short confinement made difficult only by the crowd of witnesses crammed into her bedchamber. In accordance with contemporary post-natal practice, she remained in seclusion for one month after the birth, making her first public appearance on 9 July.<br>
<br>The birth clinched the prince of Orange's decision to invade. That the child was a son seemed to confirm the predictions of those who were determined to believe that the birth was suppositious. All this wild speculation played into William's hands and the need to establish the truth about the birth was cited by him in his declaration of 1/10 October as one of the reasons justifying his actions. William's use of the rumours in this way required some sort of response. An extraordinary meeting of the privy council was held at Whitehall on 22 October to hear the testimonies of all those who had been present. Five days later these were enrolled in chancery as permanent proof of the prince's authenticity but it was already too late as only the weather was delaying the departure of the Dutch invasion fleet. On 17 November, twelve days after William had landed at Torbay, James set out from London to join his army at Salisbury. Mary Beatrice and a subcommittee of the privy council which had been appointed to assist her were left behind to manage events in the capital. The will which James signed that same day named her as regent in the event of his death. There was in truth little that Mary Beatrice could do from London to help her husband once the desertions to William's side began.<br>
<br>By the time James returned to London on 26 November, withdrawal abroad already seemed the most prudent option. The comte de Lauzun offered to organize Mary Beatrice's escape. On 1 December it was decided by James that she would leave on the night of 3 December. The subsequent failure to get the prince of Wales out of the country, as well as highlighting just how dangerous any escape would be, made it necessary to delay the plan until the following week. The queen finally left Whitehall early on the morning of 10 December disguised as a laundry woman, taking her son with her and accompanied only by Lauzun and a few of her most trusted servants. She boarded one of the royal yachts which was lying off Gravesend later that morning. Bad weather prevented their sailing until early the next day, 11/21 December, and it then took them about six hours to reach Calais. After a short stay at Boulogne, waiting for news of James, Mary Beatrice set out for Paris. She was greeted by Louis XIV at Chatou, 6 miles to the west of the French capital, on 27 December 1688/6 January 1689, whereupon Louis presented her with the use of his palace at St Germain-en-Laye. James joined her there the following day.<h2>
<a name="Exile16891718"></a>Exile, 1689&#150;1718</h2>St Germain was to be Mary Beatrice's home for the rest of her life. In some ways her time there was to be more congenial than it had been in England. She and James were honoured guests at the greatest court in western Europe, all their domestic needs were well provided for, and most of her closest servants had been able to join her. Louis XIV, who always had a soft spot for her, made sure that she was treated as a queen. As the public status of Louis XIV's morganatic wife, the marquise de Maintenon, remained ambiguous, Mary Beatrice outranked every other woman at Versailles. What tarnished it all was the sense of disappointment and failure which inevitably pervaded the court James and Mary created for themselves at St Germain. Efforts to reverse the setbacks they had suffered brought their own problems. The seventeen months James now spent in Ireland was the longest period of separation during their years of marriage. For his wife, the hope that he might regain his three kingdoms was offset by the fear that he might die in the attempt. After his return, late in 1691 Mary Beatrice became pregnant once again. On 23 March/1 April 1692 James issued summonses to several leading English peeresses to attend the birth, which was then expected to take place some time around the middle of May. This time the estimate was too optimistic and it was not until 18/28 June that she gave birth to a daughter, Louise-Maria. This weakened but did not dispel the beliefs of those that wanted to think that there had been something suspicious about Prince James's birth. The defeat of the French invasion fleet at La Hogue the previous month had ended any real possibility of an early Stuart restoration and James was realistic enough to nickname this daughter La Consolatrice. The earl of Ailesbury, seeing Mary Beatrice in 1693 for the first time in over four years, noticed how much she had aged. As she pointed out to him, &#145;Afflictions alter people fast&#146;  (T. Bruce, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Thomas, Earl of Ailesbury</span>, 2 vols., 1890, 324).<br>
<br>Religion became even more important to the exiled queen. Whereas James found spiritual solace in the time he spent at the Cistercian monastery of La Trappe, Mary Beatrice regularly retreated to the Convent of the Visitation at Chaillot, the founder of which had been her late mother-in-law, Queen Henrietta Maria. Her devotion to the memory of the order's founder, Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales, had been a constant theme in her life and while at Chaillot she could feel that she was, in part, fulfilling the vocation that she had been forced to abandon. Another key strand in her piety was her interest in the devotion to the sacred heart. Claude de la Colombi&egrave;re, the Jesuit priest who had been instrumental in the movement's development, had been one of her French chaplains in the late 1670s.<br>
<br>One recurring issue of the years of exile was the question of Mary Beatrice's jointure. She was able to argue that if, as the 1689 convention had assumed, her husband was legally dead, she was entitled to the payments of &pound;50,000 per annum which she had been promised for her widowhood. The French took up the issue during the peace negotiations at Rijswijk (Ryswick) in 1697. The English government indicated that payments would be forthcoming but this undertaking came to nothing as no payments had been made by the time hostilities with France were renewed in 1702. In 1706 Mary Beatrice indicated that, in return for this money, she would pay off the bills she still owed to tradesmen in England. Her attempts to claim the personal property of her brother following his death in 1694 were equally unsuccessful. Cardinal d'Este, who had withdrawn from holy orders on succeeding to the dukedom as Rinaldo I, aligned himself with the League of Augsburg against Louis XIV and, although they were never broken off, relations between uncle and niece were strained thereafter. Modena was occupied by French troops in 1698.<br>
<br>James's health was declining fast, and in the spring of 1701 Mary Beatrice accompanied him on his trip to Bourbon to take the waters. She was, however, not present when James died on 5/16 September 1701, as it was not thought appropriate for queens to attend royal deathbeds and she had retired to her own apartments after taking her final leave from him. On receiving the news and after paying her respects to her son, Mary Beatrice withdrew to Chaillot. By James's will of 28 August/8 September 1701, Mary Beatrice became his sole executor and guardian of their son. For the next five years she was, in Jacobite eyes, the <i>de jure</i> regent of England, Scotland, and Ireland. In 1702 she opposed the idea that her son should go to Scotland to oppose the accession of his half-sister Anne. It made little sense to seek his restoration while his mother remained regent. Her own health was not good. In the autumn of 1703 she was operated on for breast cancer. The tumours reappeared and she underwent a second operation in 1705.<br>
<br>On 10/21 July 1706 James Stuart (the Old Pretender James III) came of age. Mary Beatrice's public role then shrank to that of the matriarchal figure presiding over the court at St Germain, which, even from a Jacobite point of view, was facing a period of slow, terminal decline. Two separate developments in 1712 deprived Mary Beatrice of the company of both her children. On 7/18 April 1712 Louise-Maria died of smallpox. Four months later her son was forced to move to Chalons in order to allow the French to commence peace negotiations with the British. On the other hand, the conclusion of the treaty of Utrecht in the following year revived hopes that her jointure might finally be paid. In December 1713 Queen Anne authorized the payments of those sums which were owed from the previous Lady day onwards, with the payments to be made via the heirs of Sidney, Lord Godolphin, Mary Beatrice's former lord chamberlain, who had been the last surviving of the trustees for her jointure appointed in 1685. However, none of this money ever reached her. Anne died eight months later and George I had no reason to resolve the issue. In June 1715 Mary Beatrice visited her son at Bar-le-Duc. She saw him for the last time early the following year when he stopped off at St Germain on his return from Scotland. Before long he had moved first to Avignon and then to Italy. By this time Mary Beatrice's main preoccupation was the question of who her son should marry.<br>
<br>Mary Beatrice died at Ch&acirc;teau de St Germain on 26 April/7 May 1718. The cause of death was believed to be inflammation of the lungs, complicated by an abscess on her left side remaining from her most recent cancer operation. Her body was interred in the chapel at Chaillot on 16/27 June, while her viscera were buried before the monument containing her husband's brain in the Coll&egrave;ge des Escossois in Paris. The tomb at Chaillot was destroyed, along with the other Stuart tombs and the rest of the convent, during the French Revolution.<br>
<br>Most of her biographers to date have shown Mary Beatrice to have been a fairly typical princess of the seventeenth century. The life of a royal bride married off to a foreign prince was always difficult, but she had the advantages of intelligence, charm, and diffidence and she quickly adapted to life at the English and French courts. On a purely personal level, James's marriage to her was one of the better decisions he made. Her virtues should not, however, be overstated. Too often, the way in which her popular biographers have presented her life, as being particularly romantic, ill-fated, and Catholic, has owed more to the manner in which those historians have also interpreted those other imprudent or ineffectual Stuart queens, Mary, queen of Scots, Henrietta Maria, and Catherine of Braganza. Stuart queens are expected to be tragic. Some of the sympathy which Mary Beatrice has thus been accorded is, however, understandable, given the undoubted unfairness of many of the misfortunes which befell her. Historians of her husband's reign have, on the other hand, been much more hard-headed, portraying her influence on James as generally misguided, although this has sometimes been exaggerated. The circle of courtiers around her, which may yet prove to be the key to understanding the true nature of that influence, has been little studied.<br>
