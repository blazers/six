<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cresswell,  (Elizabeth) Helen</span>  (1934&#150;2005), <span class="occ">children's author</span>, was born on 11 July 1934 at Orchard House nursing home, Kirkby in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, the second of three children of Joseph Edward Cresswell and his wife, Annie Edna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. She was originally named Edna Helen Cresswell, but throughout her life was known, and published, as Helen Cresswell. At the time of her birth her father, the son of a miner, had his own business as a wholesale fruit merchant. The family lived in West Bridgford, a comfortable suburb of Nottingham, but were unhappy. Her father, who bore the physical and mental scars of the First World War, was frequently drunk and violent, and bullied his wife who would, but for her children, she told them, &#145;leave him tomorrow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Something about the Author</span>, 106). His eventual bankruptcy was a shameful secret long kept from his children. Annie Cresswell came from a better-off Nottinghamshire family: she had been to grammar school, was well-read and a good pianist. She encouraged her children to read widely, and taught other children so as to afford fee-paying schools for her own. In Cresswell's account of her childhood in <span class="italic">Something about the Author</span> (1995) she wrote that when she first read D. H. Lawrence's <span class="italic">Sons and Lovers</span> &#145;it was as though the writer had lifted the roof of our own house to find his characters&#146;  (ibid., 115).<br>
<br>Cresswell enjoyed school (&#145;a world of calm and order, a predictable world with its own framework&#146;; <span class="italic">Something about the Author</span>, 110) and at the age of ten won a scholarship to Nottingham Girls' High School. Her parents were Christian Scientists, not consistently, but enough to pass on to their children the belief that illness was one's &#145;own fault for not thinking the right thoughts&#146;  (ibid., 103). At the age of twelve she suffered a back problem which, neglected, led to her being hospitalized, and missing school for most of a year. Back at school she felt she was two people: &#145;the popular class clown, one of the top clique. But my real, secret self is the one who sits up into the early hours to finish poems &hellip; constantly aware of a mystery beyond the banalities of everyday life&#146;  (ibid., 114). She had been writing poems from the age of six and regarded her early writing in the style of Keats, Wordsworth, and de la Mare as her apprenticeship, &#145;my five finger exercise, my scales&#146;  (<span class="italic">Author Zone</span>, 42). Encouraged by her mother to enter competitions, she won a Poetry Society prize when she was sixteen and assumed that she would be a poet when she grew up.<br>
<br>Cresswell went to King's College, London, and took a degree in English in 1955. She then did a variety of jobs, including fashion buying, secretarial work, and teaching at a Nottingham school, and on 14 April 1962 she married (Leslie) Brian Rowe (1934&#150;2000), the son of Leslie Baker Rowe, a Nottingham lace manufacturer. At the time of their marriage he was marketing director for the family factory but lost his job after a takeover, and then ran a corner shop. They had two daughters, Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1963) and Candida (<i>b</i>. 1971). Her husband was even-tempered, and a successful foil for Cresswell while the children grew up, but they then separated without acrimony. The marriage was dissolved in 1995.<br>
<br>Cresswell's first published book was <span class="italic">Sonya-by-the-Shore</span> (1960), about a girl who lives by a lake with her grandparents, thinking that is the whole world until she hears about a big city full of people across the lake. In 1963 she started on a completely different tack&#151;a series of stories about Jumbo Spencer, an eleven-year-old boy with no intention of being like anyone else his age. The second book, <span class="italic">Jumbo Back to Nature</span> (1965), introduced one of her enduring themes&#151;a tramp or wanderer who represents freedom and living for what's round the corner.<br>
<br>Cresswell tried various settings and styles until she made her name with <span class="italic">The Piemakers</span> (1967), about Gravella Roller, daughter of one of the hereditary piemaking families of Danby Dale. For this book she received the first of her four nominations for the Library Association's Carnegie medal. The others were for <span class="italic">The Night Watchmen</span> (1969), <span class="italic">Up the Pier</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">The Bongleweed</span> (1973). <span class="italic">The Night Watchmen</span> (which won the Children's Literature Association's phoenix award in 1989) was perhaps her most personal fantasy, seamless and poetic, full of hard-to-catch meaning. In it a boy meets two tramps, &#145;Do-as-you-pleasers&#146;, who tell him, &#145;You've got Here &hellip; and you've got There. We're from There&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Night Watchmen</span>, 50). Her other favourite among her books was <span class="italic">The Winter of the Birds</span> (1975).<br>
<br>Cresswell also became an expert and enthusiastic writer for children's television, starting with the BBC's <span class="italic">Jackanory</span> programme. She sometimes wrote for book publication and television simultaneously, with specified locations, as in <span class="italic">Moondial</span> (1987), set at Belton House, Grantham. Her <span class="italic">Lizzie Dripping</span> series (1973 onwards) was filmed around her home, and the television series and books made Lizzie Dripping perhaps her most enduring character. (Her <span class="italic">Bagthorpe Saga</span>, also televised, was her most sustained series of books.) She was also a good adapter of other authors, with a particular affinity for Edith Nesbit. She liked the collaboration and teamwork inherent in television. The medium rewarded her: in 2000 she was joint winner of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) children's writer's award.<br>
<br>Cresswell was equally at home with high humour and deep mystery, fantasy, pastoral and fairy story, slapstick and menace, the numinous and the anarchic. Her books celebrated the singular and eccentric, timeless craft, ceremony and community, and the natural world. She wrote over 100 children's books for a variety of publishers and said of them, &#145;Whatever the outward settings of my stories, the adventures they chart are essentially inner ones&#146;  (<span class="italic">Author Zone</span>, 42). She wrote early in the morning, sitting on the floor, and drafted stories at speed, without prior plotting, in bound blank books, changing very little thereafter. While writing she was happy, but she suffered from depression (for which she had a variety of treatments) and sometimes couldn't write for months. When elated she spent money on antiques and on statues for her garden.<br>
<br>Five feet ten inches tall, with long blonde hair, Cresswell cared how she looked. In middle age, with still-long hair, and stylish but unusual clothes, her appearance was particularly striking. She was independent-minded but easy to work with, ambitious, practical, and businesslike, but averse to the metropolitan literary scene. Despite her shyness she was good at talking to audiences of all ages. She listed her recreations as watercolour painting, collecting pictures, books, antiques and coincidences, and sundial watching. She was married in an Anglican church, and considered herself Christian, but not conventionally. She believed in ghosts. Her politics were Labour, veering later to Liberal Democrat. She remained attached to her family and her Nottinghamshire roots and bought a Georgian farmhouse, Old Church Farm, in the small village of Eakring, near Rufford Abbey, where she set another of her books (<span class="italic">The Secret World of Polly Flint</span>, 1982). She died at her home in Eakring on 26 September 2005, of cancer, and was cremated at Mansfield crematorium. Her memorial service was at Southwell Minster on 25 November 2005. She was survived by her two daughters.<br>
