<span class="headword">Forman family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1784&#150;<em>c.</em>1870), <span class="occ">ironmasters</span>, lived during the first half of the eighteenth century at Waltham on the Wolds in Leicestershire. <a name="cosubject_56537"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Forman</span>  (1692&#150;1768) was a local <span class="occ">landowner</span> married to Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Houton, but three of his sons, <a name="cosubject_56538"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Forman</span>  (1725&#150;1802)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_56539"></a><span class="headword">Henry Forman</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 14 January 1741 at Waltham, and <a name="cosubject_56540"></a><span class="headword">Richard [i] Forman</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1794)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 11 January 1733 at Waltham, left the county to take up employment in the ordnance department of the army. The brothers probably owed their appointments to the patronage of John Manners, marquess of Granby (1721&#150;1770), eldest son of John, third duke of Rutland (1696&#150;1779); the Rutlands were the most important landowners in the Waltham on the Wolds area. Granby was a soldier of note and became a lieutenant-general and colonel of the Royal Horse Guards. After distinguished service in the Seven Years' War he became master-general of the ordnance on 1 July 1763.<br>
<br>The turbulent period of the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence saw a great expansion in the ordnance trade. As a clerk in the Board of Ordnance Richard [i] Forman witnessed this increase in trade and the effects it had on the iron industry. He spent his working life at the Tower of London, where he became proof master during the American War of Independence. He married twice; his first wife was Mary Baines, his second, Elizabeth Crewe, and his six children were baptized in the church of St Peter ad Vincula, within the Tower precincts.<br>
<br>Through his work for the Board of Ordnance Richard [i] Forman became associated with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47499/', "Homfray family")</script>, who had been involved in casting cannon at the Calcutts ironworks in Shropshire, and at Cyfarthfa, Merthyr Tudful, in south Wales. In 1784 Forman advanced more than &pound;10,000 to the Homfrays to assist in funding the Penydarren ironworks at Merthyr Tudful, and he became a partner in the concern. By 1796 the Penydarren partnership included members of the Homfray family, Henry Forman of Woolwich, and Richard [i] Forman's son William. Henry Forman had by this time risen to become first secretary of the royal laboratories under Colonel Congreve.<br>
<br>Richard [i] Forman's sons and grandson also became employees of the Board of Ordnance. His son <a name="cosubject_56541"></a><span class="headword">Richard [ii] Forman</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1830)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 15 September 1763 at St Peter ad Vincula, was employed at the Tower of London before moving to the naval branch of the office. He married on 5 June 1786 Martha Skey of Harpenden. Their son, <a name="cosubject_56542"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iii] Forman</span>  (1795&#150;1880)<span class="occ"></span>, worked at his father's office at Chatham and later became chief storekeeper at Gibraltar, which ranked third in the garrison. He married Mary Heath (1810&#150;1880) and died on 5 May 1880 at his home at Langley Road, Watford, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Richard [i] Forman's fourth son, <a name="cosubject_56543"></a><span class="headword">William Forman</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> 1829)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 6 June 1767 at St Peter's, also combined the family's interests in the ordnance trade and the Welsh iron industry. After the Homfray family withdrew their business interests from Merthyr Tudful, William Forman became co-owner of the Penydarren ironworks with Alderman William Thompson of London, who had set up a merchant house in London in 1798 with the Homfray and Forman families. During the 1820s William Forman considerably expanded his iron-making interests, and on his death in 1829 he held a three-eighths share in the Penydarren ironworks along with shares in the Aberd&acirc;r, Tredegar, Bute, and Rhymni ironworks. Part of the capital for this expansion had been acquired through his marriage on 8 September 1789 to Mary Seaton, the daughter of a Doncaster landowner. He died at Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 23 July 1829.<br>
<br>After William's death the family's interest in the iron trade was continued through his sons, <a name="cosubject_56544"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Seaton Forman</span>  (1791&#150;1850)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_56545"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iv] Forman</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1882)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_57508"></a><span class="headword">William Henry Forman</span>  (1794&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>. The brothers presided over the Forman financial empire at a time of great expansion within the Welsh iron trade. In 1830 the south Wales ironworks produced no less than 40 per cent of all the iron manufactured in Britain. Furthermore, all the Forman ironworks were to be successful producers of wrought-iron rails during the boom period from 1840 to 1860. Thomas Seaton Forman's business career encouraged him to become involved in politics, and he sat as MP for Bridgwater in Somerset from 1841 until 1847. His wealth also allowed him to purchase Pippbrook House, Dorking, in 1849, and then to indulge fully in his hobby of collecting antiques and <i>objets d'art</i>. He died in 1850 at Pisa, while on a collecting trip to Italy. He left a widow, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moore (<i>d</i>. 1889); they had no children and the majority of the family's wealth became concentrated in the hands of his unmarried brother, William Henry Forman, who wisely withdrew from the ownership of the Penydarren ironworks in 1859 and sold the mineral property to the Dowlais ironworks. At this time his fortune was assessed at several million pounds, some of which he contributed to church restoration. In 1853 a fire had destroyed St George's Church, Doncaster, and because of his family's connections with the town Forman offered to rebuild the south chapel at his own expense. George Gilbert Scott was employed as the architect and the rebuilt chapel became known as the Forman Chapel. Forman also engaged the Scott office to rebuild and extend Pippbrook House. He was a great collector of antiques and a private museum was built within the house. During the 1860s Forman also paid for the rebuilding of the chancel of St Martin's Church, Dorking. He died at his home, Fonthill House in Tunbridge Wells, on 28 August 1869, after three and a half years' suffering from paraplegia.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1860s the Forman family continued to operate their iron merchant's business in London and to hold a major share in the Tredegar ironworks. However, the family's long-standing connection with the south Wales iron trade came to an end soon after the death of William Henry Forman in 1869. An indication of the important position that the family held in the south Wales iron industry is that his will was later proved at just over &pound;1 million. The family had been actively involved in the iron trade of south Wales for nearly ninety years, and members of the Forman family had been founding partners in three of the largest ironworks in the area.<br>
