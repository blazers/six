<span class="headword">Peard,  John Whitehead</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Garibaldi's Englishman]</span>  (1811&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Fowey, Cornwall, in July 1811, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21696/', "Vice-Admiral Shuldham Peard")</script> and his second wife, Matilda, daughter of William Fortescue of Penwarne. He was educated at the King's School, Ottery St Mary, Devon, and at Exeter College, Oxford (matriculated 4 March 1829, BA 2 May 1833, MA 17 November 1836). A youth of &#145;great stature and extraordinary muscular strength&#146;, who at nineteen years of age weighed 14 stone, he was described as possessing &#145;the shoulders of a bull&#146;. As stroke of the college boat, he was famous on the river, and during the town-and-gown rows of his undergraduate days his height and skill in boxing reputedly made him an object of terror to the roughs. In 1837 he became a barrister of the Inner Temple, being called on the same day with Sir F. H. Doyle, who described Peard's draining on a gaudy day in hall a loving-cup holding about 2 quarts of wine.<br>
<br>He married at East Teignmouth, Devon, on 7 June 1838, Catherine Augusta, daughter of the Revd Dr William Page Richards, formerly headmaster of Blundell's School, Tiverton; she survived him. For some time he went the western circuit, but life at the bar may have been too dull for him, and from 1853 to 1861 he was a captain in the Duke of Cornwall's rangers.<br>
<br>During his frequent visits to Italy Peard had been affronted by the brutality of Neapolitan officials and, largely as a result, he in 1860 joined the forces of Garibaldi, with whose aims he had become thoroughly sympathetic, enlisting as a volunteer in the Cacciatori delle Alpi volunteer corps. When Garibaldi made his expedition to Sicily he was joined by Peard, who distinguished himself by his gallantry and indifference to danger at the battle of Milazzo (20 July 1860), and at its conclusion was raised to the rank of colonel. He accompanied Garibaldi's forces on their advance to Naples, and was appointed to command the English legion. Despite his undeniable bravery he was a mediocre commander, and the legion gave much trouble before its eventual disbandment. For his services he received from Victor Emmanuel the cross of the order of Valour, and became known in England as Garibaldi's Englishman.<br>
<br>On the retirement of Garibaldi to Caprera Peard returned to England and lived quietly. When Garibaldi visited England he fondly paid a visit to his old comrade at his house at Penquite, on the Fowey River, on 25&#150;27 April 1864, and there was a touching reunion between the two. Peard was a JP and deputy lieutenant for Cornwall, and he served the office of sheriff in 1869. He was also a prominent freemason, becoming past grand master of Cornwall on 26 August 1879. He died at Trenython, Par, on 21 November 1880, from the effects of a paralytic stroke, and was buried in Fowey cemetery on 24 November.<br>
