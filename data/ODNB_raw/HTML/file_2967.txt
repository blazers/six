<span class="headword">Bottlesham <span class="st"> [Bottisham]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1400), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, may have come from the Cambridgeshire village of Bottisham; he was certainly from East Anglia. His origins are otherwise unknown. He became a Dominican friar, and later left bequests (if possible) of &pound;50 and &pound;100 to the houses of that order in Bishop's Lynn, Norfolk, and Cambridge, &#145;because I owe as much and more&#146; to them  (Reg. Arundel, 1, fol. 166<i>v</i>): debts of gratitude, not of cash. Cambridge was certainly where he studied, graduating DTh by 17 May 1382, when he was summoned to help Archbishop William Courtenay investigate Wycliffite opinion at the celebrated Earthquake council in London. He had been appointed titular bishop Navatensis by 13 March 1380, when Bishop William Wykeham had appointed him to be his suffragan in the remoter parts of the Winchester diocese, pleading the endless rain, his own ill health, and royal business. In 1383 Bottlesham appears with the grand title of bishop of Bethlehem, but this was purely titular. He was with the Roman pope, Urban VI, albeit only (according to Walsingham) on a mission from England, when the pope was under siege at Nocera by the king of Naples in January 1385. It was probably in appreciation that the pope provided him to the see of Llandaff on 16 October 1385, to which the crown had no objection once personal fealty was given on 21 August 1386. Bottlesham at last had a &#145;real&#146; bishopric, if a very poor one.<br>
<br>Bottlesham returned to England by the beginning of August 1386, possibly with the papal envoy, Richard Northalis. In the time of the Merciless Parliament, probably in February 1388, certain suspected heretics were summoned before a panel including the bishop. They refused to appear before this &#145;apostate&#146; and denounced the rest of the panel as inadequate. These are, in effect, the only clues as to Bottlesham's rise to modest eminence; his standing in theology is already known, and whether &#145;apostate&#146; referred to some particular controversy in his career, or to especial opposition to Wycliffism (a possibility raised by his will), or was just a generic slur on him as a friar, is unknown. It is thin gruel.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1389 the eminent preacher Bishop Thomas Brinton of Rochester died. The monks elected the archbishop's official, John Barnet. Richard II signalled his assent in public, but privately requested the pope's tax collector to secure the see for his own candidate, Richard Wichened. The monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, wanted the see for their own Thomas Chillenden. On 27 August the pope translated Bottlesham; he knew of the current political divisions in England, resented recent attempts to curb his income and patronage, saw the chance to show his muscle over something not too important, and probably did want to reward Bottlesham, his only real appointee on the bench, a little more. The archbishop gave the bishop his temporalities on 15 December, and the king followed suit on 12 February 1390. Both wanted to come to terms with the pope (now Boniface IX) over major difficulties regarding taxation of the clergy and papal patronage, and so probably did not want to make trouble over so relatively small a matter as the see of Rochester.<br>
<br>In any case, Bottlesham was an apposite successor to Brinton in a see too modest to attract the interest of ambitious (and usually heavily pluralist) ecclesiastics. He proved indeed a fully resident and active bishop, although &#145;aged&#146; by January 1396, a claim supported by his unusual use of a vicar-general and suffragan even while resident, from September 1394. None the less, he preached in the convocation of Canterbury at St Paul's on 7 October 1399, a reportedly nervous assembly, in the immediate circumstances of Richard II's overthrow; perhaps his appearance on such an occasion is a final hint that his career was based on wide respect for his public and personal integrity, not on partisanship.<br>
<br>On 16 February 1400 he made a very sensitive will at his favourite manor of Trottiscliffe, Kent, aware of his parlous financial state, asking for an undemonstrative burial in the church of the Blackfriars in London, requiring that his servants be paid to the end of the quarter, thinking of the poor on his three most familiar properties, having no goods or luxuries at all to direct, recalling very fondly his upbringing in the convents of Lynn and Cambridge, invoking saints Andrew and Dominic, and naming no kin. His chief executor, interestingly, was his fellow Dominican Dr Roger Dymoke, the forceful anti-Wycliffite polemicist.<br>
<br>Bottlesham was dead by 26 February. Archbishop Arundel revoked the will, &#145;because he was obliged to other diverse creditors in great sums of money and goods&#146;  (Reg. Arundel, 1, fol. 167). On 24 May 1402, however, the administrators were able to report that at last they had paid off all the debts and could still hand over a residue of &pound;54 17<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. This was small comfort to his intended beneficiaries, no doubt, but perhaps they could remember a good, ungreedy master or friend.<br>
