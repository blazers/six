<span class="headword">Shortt,  William Hamilton</span>  (1881&#150;1971), <span class="occ">railway engineer and horologist</span>, was born on 28 September 1881 at 22 Courthope Villas, Worple Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, the only son of Charles Henry Shortt (1852&#150;1915), civil engineer, and his wife, Fanny Catherine Lise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dobson (1855&#150;1950), sister of the poet Austin Dobson. He was educated at Christ's College, Blackheath, and the Goldsmiths' Technical Institute before joining the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1902, as an articled pupil of the chief engineer, J. W. Jacomb-Hood. During his three years under Jacomb-Hood he continued to study at the Goldsmiths' Institute and also at Birkbeck Institute and King's College, London. Jacomb-Hood demonstrated his confidence in his pupil's ability by calling upon him to establish a civil engineering laboratory. In 1907 Shortt was elected to associate membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers, by which time he had already laid the foundations for a successful career as a railway engineer. However, a series of events occurred which added another dimension to his life, and one for which he is principally known.<br>
<br>In 1906 a serious accident occurred on the LSWR when an express train was derailed at Salisbury Station with the loss of twenty-eight lives. The Board of Trade inquiry concluded that the derailment was caused by excessive speed on a curve, and in 1908 a subcommittee of the Railway Engineers Association was formed to report on this issue, under the chairmanship of Jacomb-Hood. Shortt acted as secretary and technical assistant to the subcommittee from 1908 to 1910 and in this capacity he devised an instrument for accurately recording the speed of trains. The speed was determined by measuring the time taken to traverse a known length of track, and this kindled in Shortt an interest in precision time-measurement which was to last all his life. At the same time he described a graphical method for improving existing railway curves, a subject to which he was to return in 1923.<br>
<br>In 1910 a meeting took place between Shortt and Frank Hope-Jones (1868&#150;1950) which was to have a significant effect in briefly regaining for England the pre-eminence in precision clockmaking that it had once enjoyed. Hope-Jones was the proprietor of the Synchronome Company and had been largely responsible for establishing the electric clock as a reliable timekeeper in the UK. Hope-Jones and Shortt were kindred spirits, professional engineers outside the horological establishment, and receptive to new ideas. Encouraged by Hope-Jones, Shortt began a series of meticulous experiments at his home workshop at Bramcote Road in Putney and also at the Synchronome workshops in Clerkenwell in order to improve the performance of the pendulum clock. This occupied most of his spare time until 1916, when he was released from his railway duties to serve in France as a captain in the Royal Engineers. Following demobilization in 1919 he resumed his position with the LSWR and continued his horological experiments.<br>
<br>It had been recognized for some time that the ideal mechanical timekeeper was a pendulum swinging freely in a vacuum with the least possible interference, but there was no consensus about how this could be realized in practice. Hope-Jones, who was strongly influenced by the work of R. J. Rudd, was convinced that this could be achieved by using a separate slave clock to perform the normal functions of a clock and to provide an impulse to keep the free pendulum swinging. Eventually Shortt also adopted this method and was able to construct an effective free-pendulum clock, which he installed at the Royal Scottish Observatory in Edinburgh during Christmas 1921. Figures published by the astronomer royal for Scotland, Professor Sampson, in 1924 showed that the performance of the Shortt free-pendulum clock exceeded that of other mechanical timekeepers. The Synchronome Company produced a sightly modified version of this clock, which became the standard timekeeper in many observatories and institutions throughout the world.<br>
<br>Early in 1922 Shortt moved to Exeter, and following the regrouping of the railways he became district engineer of the western district of the Southern Railway, a post which he was to occupy until his retirement twenty-four years later. On 1 June 1937 he married Katherine Winifred Messer (1905&#150;1968); they had three daughters. Shortt was a shy and retiring man who was confident in the areas of his expertise. Although he was not directly involved with the development of precision clocks after his move to the west country, he continued to be a director of the Synchronome Company which had the benefit of his advice. His contributions to horology were recognized by the award of a gold medal by the British Horological Institute in 1931, the John Price Wetherill silver medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935, and the Tompion medal of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in 1954. He was made a liveryman of the company in 1931 and master in 1950.<br>
<br>In 1946, when Shortt retired from the railway, Dame Georgiana Buller was establishing the firm of Devon Instruments to provide employment for disabled persons. Shortt acted as technical adviser to the firm, which made a range of clocks, and when Dame Georgiana died in 1953 he succeeded her as chairman of the company, a post which he occupied until 1966. He died on 4 February 1971 at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, at Exeter, survived by his three daughters. He was cremated on the 10th in the Exeter and Devon crematorium.<br>
