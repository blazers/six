<span class="headword">Smith,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1672, <em>d.</em> 1738), <span class="occ">architect and builder</span>, was baptized on 4 January 1672 in Tettenhall, Staffordshire, the youngest of the three sons of Francis Smith, a bricklayer of Tettenhall, and his wife, Elizabeth Hitchins. He was trained as a mason, and in 1697 he and his brother William contracted to rebuild the nave and tower of St Mary's Church, Warwick, which had been destroyed in the great fire of 1694, to the design of Sir William Wilson. The work was carried out between 1698 and 1704, and during the course of it Francis settled in the town, with which, as &#145;Smith of Warwick&#146;, he is particularly associated.<br>
<br>Subsequently, continuing on occasion to work in partnership with his brother, Smith developed a business which made him one of the most successful of such craft-based figures in English history. The rebuilding of the town of Warwick after the fire presumably provided him with an initial opportunity, and he was later responsible for a further group of churches and other public buildings; but the predominant element in his practice was the building of country houses for the midlands gentry. Of these he produced a remarkably large number, in almost all the counties of the region, becoming unrivalled as the leading master builder there and establishing a reputation which extended well beyond it. As early as 1707 Hugh, first earl of Cholmondeley, was advised by a surveyor in London that the Smiths did a &#145;great deal of busness in the Contry and they have done a great deal of work thearabout &amp; in Warwick you may easy hear of them&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 883); and when in the 1730s Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, was building a house as far away as Wimbledon, Surrey, she stipulated that<blockquote>Mr. Smith of Warwickshire the Builder may be employed to make Contracts and to Measure the Work and to doe every thing in his Way that is necessary to Compleat the Work as far as the Distance he is at will give him leave to do. (ibid.)</blockquote>The scope of the operation which enabled Smith to achieve this position was complex and wide-ranging. Its basis appears to have been that, although himself a master of one building trade only, like other leading master builders of the period he was prepared to undertake the erection of a complete house, performing the masonry himself and subcontracting the work of the other trades; and he evidently built up a team of craftsman associates&#151;joiners, carpenters, painters, plasterers&#151;whom he called upon regularly in these circumstances. His favoured method of working was to provide detailed estimates of the costs and to charge a five per cent commission&#151;the usual fee of architects at the time when acting in a supervisory capacity&#151;on the actual expenditure. In addition, he acted as a supplier of set-piece marble masonry works such as chimney-pieces, and, occasionally, funerary monuments, and there is some evidence that he also dealt in timber. As for the actual designs, both he and his brother normally provided these themselves, but he also continued the practice of contracting to build to those of other architects: examples of this are Heythrop House, Oxfordshire (1705&#150;8), designed by Thomas Archer, and a number of buildings by James Gibbs, notably Ditchley House, Oxfordshire (1720&#150;42), and All Saints' Church, Derby (1723&#150;5; later the cathedral)&#151;although in both these cases he appears to have had some influence on the design as well. Whatever role he was playing, however, it is clear that the foundation of Smith's success was a reputation for honesty and reliability. Lord Cholmondeley's correspondent referred to the Smiths as &#145;very good Workmen&#146;, and when Smith died in 1738 Sir Edmund Isham of Lamport, Northamptonshire, lamented the loss of &#145;our honest Builder Mr. Smith of Warwick&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 883).<br>
<br>What in general cannot be claimed for Smith is a specially high level of distinction as a designer. His houses are always monuments of excellent craftsmanship, but as one eighteenth-century critic who had seen a number of them observed, although &#145;all of them [are] convenient and handsome &hellip; there is a great sameness in the plans, which proves he had but little invention&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 883). His typical product is a three-storey rectangular block, which represents in essence the standard late seventeenth-century &#145;double pile&#146; brought up to date by the replacement of the hipped roof of the latter by an attic storey and crowning parapet. A repertory of ornament of a vernacular baroque character is applied with varying degrees of restraint, while the interiors, usually arranged with the hall and saloon across the centre and the staircase to one side, are enriched with fine joinery and plasterwork but little in the way of spatial incident. Examples among the many are Meriden Hall, Warwickshire (<i>c</i>.1720), and Davenport Hall (1726), Kinlet Hall (1727&#150;9), and probably Mawley Hall (1730), all in Shropshire. Of the relatively few exceptions to the pattern, two which call for mention are Chicheley Hall, Buckinghamshire (1719&#150;21), and Sutton Scarsdale, Derbyshire (begun 1724): the exotic fa&ccedil;ade of the former probably owes more to the taste of the patron, Sir John Chester, than to Smith's own devising; but Sutton Scarsdale, in part evidently inspired by Gibbs's unexecuted design of 1721 for the university buildings at Cambridge, is his finest work, a wholly convincing essay in the heroic grand manner, in which the giant Corinthian order is handled with total assurance.<br>
<br>Smith suffered periodically from gout&#151;in 1720 he wrote that the drawing of a sketch &#145;at this time has occasioned me to make many a wry face by reason I could neither sit nor stand to do it&#146;  (Gomme, &#145;Architects and craftsmen&#146;, 87)&#151;and in his later years he put on weight: &#145;It is unlucky that Mr. Smith is grown so unweildy&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 884), commented Dr George Clarke of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1730. He bought a country estate at Knowle, Warwickshire, for &pound;10,000 and he twice served as mayor of Warwick, in 1713&#150;14 and 1728&#150;9.<br>
<br>Smith was married twice: first in 1695 to Mary Morteboys, and second on 13 October 1702 to Anne Lea, a native of Warwick: he had four sons and one daughter but only two of the sons survived their father. Of these the elder, William (1705&#150;1747), to whom he left &#145;all my stock of Marble and Timber &hellip; in my Marble Yard in Warwick&#146;  (will), continued in his father's business and built some more country houses in the midlands. Smith was buried at Warwick on 9 April 1738.<br>
