<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maudslay,  Henry</span>  (1771&#150;1831), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born on 22 August 1771 at Woolwich, the son of Henry Maudslay 
    (sometimes Maudsley; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1780)
   who was a native of Clapham in Yorkshire who had served in the Royal Artillery and had become a workman at the Woolwich arsenal. Maudslay's father died while he was a boy and this was probably why he himself began work in the arsenal at an early age. He demonstrated considerable skill at the forge and with machinery, and attracted the attention of the engineer and inventor Joseph Bramah (1748&#150;1814). Bramah had already established a successful business as a manufacturer of water closets and locks, and he went on to make important innovations with hydraulic power for the operation of presses and other equipment. When Maudslay joined him in 1789 at the age of eighteen, Bramah was struggling to develop a new type of lock, and it was Maudslay who devised and constructed the machines capable of producing the precisely designed parts for this apparatus. He was probably also responsible for the self-tightening leather collar which made Bramah's hydraulic press work efficiently. In 1790 Maudslay married Sarah Tindale (1761/2&#150;1828), who had been Bramah's housekeeper; and they had four sons and three daughters (see below).<br>
<br>After nine years with Bramah, Maudslay had a dispute with his employer about his wages and left to set up business on his own in 1798, acquiring premises first in Wells Road, off Oxford Street, and then in Margaret Street, Marylebone. He was brought to the attention of Marc Isambard Brunel (1769&#150;1849), who employed him to build the series of forty-four machines which Brunel had been commissioned to construct at Portsmouth Dockyard for the production in bulk of ships' blocks, indispensable items for the rigging of sails in the naval vessels of the time. A high degree of precision was necessary in manufacture in order to ensure complete interchangeability of parts, and his outstanding success in achieving this makes it possible to represent Maudslay, together with Brunel, as a very early exponent of what was, in effect, a system of mass production.<br>
<br>The success of this enterprise brought Maudslay a wider reputation and brought increasing prosperity to his workshop. He took out patents (no. 2872 in 1805 and no. 3117 in 1808) for machinery to print patterns on cotton fabrics, and (no. 2948 in 1806, in conjunction with Bryan Donkin) for a differential motion for raising weights, which could be used for driving lathes. In 1807 he patented an arrangement of a steam engine, which became known as a &#145;table engine&#146; (no. 3050) on account of the compact shape of the framework supporting the cylinder, and which became very popular in applications where only a small amount of power was required. With the expansion of his business, Maudslay sought larger premises and in 1810 he moved to Westminster Bridge Road, where the firm remained until the end of his life. He traded under the title of Henry Maudslay &amp; Co. until he took into partnership Joshua Field and the firm became known as Maudslay, Field &amp; Co. With the inclusion of Maudslay's sons it subsequently became Maudslay, Sons, and Field.<br>
<br>The firm developed a strong interest in the expansion of steam navigation, producing a number of important improvements in the marine steam engine in the shape of the distinctive &#145;side-lever&#146; engine, with the heavy overhead beam being replaced by levers alongside the engine, which lowered its centre of gravity and thus made it more suitable for ship propulsion. Maudslay also patented (no. 3538 in 1812, in conjunction with Robert Dickinson) a method of purifying sea water by blowing air through it, for use in marine engines.<br>
<br>Maudslay's outstanding contribution to mechanical engineering, however, derives less from the goods that he produced than from the machine tools that he devised and the workmen he trained. His machine tools&#151;that is, the key machines such as lathes, planing machines, slotting and drilling machines, and suchlike, used for making other machines&#151;were of superlative quality, and provided models for all subsequent mechanical engineers. He realized at the outset of his career that only the very highest standards of precision and accuracy were adequate for the mass replication of the many new machines, such as textile machines and steam engines, which were revolutionizing methods of industrial production in Britain at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By insisting on the use of high quality metal for all parts of his machines, by incorporating features such as the slide-rest as a matter of routine into his workshop lathes, and by standardizing the screws and other widely used parts in his workshops, Maudslay effected a transformation in the standards of engineering workshop practice. Above all, by determining exact standards of workmanship through constant application of his micrometer, capable of measuring to within a ten thousandth of an inch (so authoritative was the regime of this instrument that it is reputed to have been nicknamed &#145;the lord chancellor&#146; in Maudslay's workshop), and by issuing his workmen with standard plane surfaces to test their own workmanship, Maudslay brought what had previously been the standards of scientific instrument makers into commonplace engineering routine.<br>
<br>Regarding the workmen whom he trained, Maudslay is remarkable for the number of young men who served in his workshop before going on to secure great fame and distinction as engineers in their own right. Joseph Clements, Richard Roberts, James Nasmyth, Samuel Seaward, William Muir, and Joseph Whitworth all served some years with Maudslay and absorbed his passion for accuracy and high quality. They all, moreover, were accustomed to speak of him subsequently with affection and gratitude. The testimony of Nasmyth was typical in this respect:<blockquote>The indefatigable care which he took in inculcating and diffusing among his workmen, and mechanical men generally, sound ideas of practical knowledge, and refined views of construction, has rendered, and ever will continue to render, his name identified with all that is noble in the ambition of a lover of mechanical perfection. (Buchanan, 401)</blockquote>Maudslay was a large man, standing 6 feet 2 inches tall, with, in Smiles's words, a jolly and good-natured temperament. Sarah Maudslay died on 29 March 1828, aged sixty-six, and Maudslay himself died, of complications following a chill, on 15 February 1831 at Lambeth and was buried in Woolwich churchyard. His sons continued the business and two of them made their mark on its development. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_18359"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Henry Maudslay</span>  (1792&#150;1864)<span class="occ"></span>, demonstrated considerable commercial ability, which contributed to the progress of the firm both during and after his father's life. He gave evidence before a select committee of the House of Commons on steam navigation in 1831. Maudslay purchased an estate at Banstead Park, Surrey, was twice married and had at least one son. He died of heart disease at Knight's Hill, Norwood, London, on 23 April 1864 and was buried at Woolwich.<br>
<br>Henry Maudslay's third son, who also had gifts as an engineer, was <a name="cosubject_18358"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Maudslay</span>  (1801&#150;1861)<span class="occ"></span>. Apprenticed as a shipbuilder to William Pitcher of Northfleet, he subsequently joined his father's engineering business at Lambeth and took a prominent position in it. An improved oscillating steam engine, which he patented in 1827, dispensed with a beam or slide-guides by allowing the cylinder to rock on trunnions with each stroke. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1833; and with Joshua Field he took out a patent in 1839 for a double-cylinder marine engine, which was widely adopted. He took a great interest in marine propulsion, and in 1841&#150;2 the firm made the engine for <i>Rattler</i>, the first screw-propelled steamship built for the Admiralty, which was used for trials of various forms of screw propellers. He also invented the direct-acting annular cylinder screw engine, which formed the subject of a paper read by him to the Institution of Naval Architects in 1860. He died on 25 September 1861 at 21 Hyde Park Square, London. He was survived by his wife, Anna Maria Stamp Maudslay, and they had at least one son.<br>
