<span class="headword">Poynter,  William</span>  (1762&#150;1827), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop and vicar apostolic of the London district</span>, was born at Petersfield, Hampshire, on 20 May 1762, the son of John Poynter, a coachmaker and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Todd; he was baptized a Catholic on 24 May. Educated initially at Petersfield grammar school, he entered the English College at Douai on 3 August 1775. He was ordained a priest in 1786 and took the degree of DD, becoming prefect of studies at the college. In 1793 he and the other seminarians were moved by the French revolutionary authorities to the castle of Dourlens, and then held prisoner in the Irish College at Douai. These adventures were afterwards recounted by Poynter in the <span class="italic">Catholic Magazine and Review</span> (1831). On 25 February 1795 the seminarians were sent to England, where they landed on 2 March.<br>
<br>Upon his return to England, Poynter was nominated by Bishop Douglass to be vice-president of Old Hall Green College, near Ware in Hertfordshire. When Dr Gregory Stapleton was made vicar apostolic of the midland district, Poynter became president of Old Hall Green College (March 1801) and afterwards served as Stapleton's vicar-general. On 3 March 1803 he was appointed coadjutor to Dr John Douglass, vicar apostolic of the London district, by a papal brief; he was consecrated bishop of Halia <i>in partibus</i> at Old Hall Green College on 29 May. When Douglass died, on 8 May 1812, Poynter also succeeded to the vicariate <i>per coadjutoriam</i>.<br>
<br>Poynter's fluency in French, knowledge of Italian, training in theology and canon law, and love of scholastic disputation well prepared him for the theological and political debates then plaguing the English Catholic community. A &#145;man of polished manners, and proverbial coolness and moderation&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Eve of Catholic Emancipation</span>, 1.28), his refined style and subtle distinctions contrasted sharply with the rancorous activities and quick judgements of the vicar apostolic of the midland district, Bishop John Milner. The two clashed repeatedly when Poynter counselled Douglass to take a moderate and canonically precise approach to the London-exiled French clergy who criticized the papacy's 1801 concordat with Napoleon.<br>
<br>Poynter consistently tried to mediate between the leading Catholic laymen, who were willing to grant some political securities to the government in exchange for Catholic emancipation, and Milner and the Irish bishops, who would accept no compromises. His struggle to interpret the political and theological issues of the day in an orthodox yet open manner may be seen in his published controversy with the Irish radical priest Charles O'Conor  (<span class="italic">A Theological Examination of the Doctrine of Columbanus</span>, 1811) and the large collection of unpublished letters and comments on parliamentary petitions held in the archives of the archbishop of Westminster. When Milner accused him of schismatic tendencies and publicly attacked the other vicars apostolic, Poynter composed his &#145;Apologetical epistle&#146; to Cardinal Litta, prefect of the propaganda, dated 15 March 1815. The document was not intended to be made public, but was translated and printed, without his knowledge, by Charles Butler, who published it in 1820 as part of his <span class="italic">Historical Memoirs of the English Catholics</span>  (vol. 4, appx, n. 1). In addition to his annual publications in the <span class="italic">Laity's Directory</span> (1813&#150;28) and numerous pastoral addresses, from 1813 Poynter worked actively with the leading laity in the Catholic Bible Society to publish a popular stereotyped edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, for which he wrote a preface in 1815. Although Milner vigorously objected, this work was never condemned in Rome.<br>
<br>In 1823 the Holy See appointed Dr James Yorke Bramston as Poynter's coadjutor, <i>cum jure successionis</i>. Along with other English and Scottish Catholic prelates, Poynter issued the famous <span class="italic">Declaration of the Catholic Bishops, the Vicars Apostolic, and their Coadjutors in Great Britain</span> (1826). He died in Castle Street, Holborn, London, on 26 November 1827, and was buried first (on 11 December 1827) in the church of St Mary Moorfields, London, where a monument was erected to his memory, and then at Old Hall Green, near Ware (1903). His funeral sermon, which was preached by the Revd Lewis Havard, was printed. In addition to Poynter's occasional contributions to Catholic magazines, he was also responsible for putting together <span class="italic">The Catholic Soldier's and Sailor's Prayer Book</span> (repr. 1858).<br>
