<span class="headword">Pyne,  Hugh</span>  (1569/70&#150;1628), <span class="occ">lawyer and alleged traitor</span>, was a younger son of John Pyne (<i>d</i>. 1609), barrister, of Curry Mallet, Somerset, and Juliana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Towse. He followed his father to Lincoln's Inn, London, in 1588 at the age of eighteen, was called to the bar in 1596, and in 1597 married Mabel, daughter of Henry Staverton of Durley, Hampshire. In his will, dated 1 October 1624, Pyne refers to his &#145;most virtuous, loving, dutiful, dear, wise, and understandingly religious wife&#146;, who died in 1618  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/155). The couple had one son, Arthur, born at Micheldever, Hampshire, and a daughter, Christabella, born at Monckton, Dorset. Pyne possessed lands and leases in Dorset and Somerset, but his principal residence, where he paid his &pound;20 subsidy, was at Cathanger in the parish of Fivehead, Somerset. Observers in 1627 described him as &#145;a man of great estate, &pound;2000 per annum at the least&#146;  (Birch and Williams, 1.295). Pyne's will, with its &#145;assurance by faith&#146; and expectation of &#145;blessed immortality&#146;, suggests a mainstream moderate puritanism.<br>
<br>Pyne rose under James I to become counsel to Queen Anne and a practitioner in Star Chamber. He contributed to the refurbishment of Lincoln's Inn in 1610, was a bencher by 1613, a reader by 1616, and treasurer from 1624 to 1626, displaying his arms in the inn's west window. He served as a justice of peace for Dorset (1614&#150;26), recorder for Weymouth (1615&#150;28), JP for Somerset (1616&#150;26), and deputy <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Somerset (1622&#150;6). He was active against Charles I's forced loan, and outspoken against the raising and billeting of troops. Historians have subsequently judged him &#145;pompous&#146;, &#145;waspish&#146;, and &#145;rambunctious&#146;  (Barnes, 70, 262), and &#145;short-tempered and tactless&#146;  (Cust, 192).<br>
<br>Charles I's visit to Somerset in the autumn of 1625 occasioned the words that made Hugh Pyne notorious. When a neighbour reported seeing King Charles at Hinton St George, Pyne responded:<blockquote>then hast thou seen as unwise a king as ever was, and so governed as never king was; for he is carried as a man would carry a child with an apple. Therefore I and divers more did refuse to do our duties unto him. (<span class="italic">Reports of Sir George Croke</span>, 83)</blockquote>Pyne then reportedly added that Charles I &#145;is to be carried any whither &hellip; he is no more fit to be king than Hickwright&#146;, referring to &#145;an old simple fellow who was then Mr. Pyne's shepherd&#146;  (ibid.). Pyne's enemies secured &#145;an accusation of treason for words spoken in contempt of the king&#146;, which cost him his liberty and his career. Other reports had him saying that the king was &#145;stripped and governed by a company of upstarts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Walter Yonge</span>, 110). Pyne's principal accuser was John Poulet (made a baron in 1627), a client of the duke of Buckingham, and the king's host on his visit to Hinton.<br>
<br>Arrested in June 1627, Pyne was first committed to his chamber in Lincoln's Inn, then confined to the gatehouse, and by November he was in the king's bench prison awaiting trial for treason. If guilty he faced a gruesome execution and forfeiture of his estates. But Pyne commanded formidable legal resources. His application for habeas corpus was supported by William Noy, John Bramston, John Selden, and Henry Calthorpe, and their pleading at Westminster on 22 November produced &#145;wonderful applause, even of shouting and clapping of hands, which is unusual in that place&#146;  (Birch and Williams, 1.292). A panel of senior judges, including Sir Nicholas Hyde, Sir Thomas Richardson, Sir John Walter, and Sir Henry Yelverton, debated the case before the attorney-general, Sir Robert Heath, and reviewed the law of treason. Their conclusion, repeated in <span class="italic">State Trials</span>, was that:<blockquote>the speaking of the words before mentioned, though they were as wicked as might be, was not treason &hellip; the words spoken here can be but evidence to discover the corrupt heart of him that spake them; but of themselves they are not treason, neither can any indictment be framed upon them.(<span class="italic">Reports of Sir George Croke</span>, 89; <span class="italic">State Trials</span>, 3.367)</blockquote>Pyne's case established the judgment that words by themselves could not constitute treason. A statute of 1352 had made it treason to &#145;compass or imagine the death of our lord the king&#146; and to give &#145;aid and comfort&#146; to the king's enemies, but conviction required an overt act  (25 Edw. III s. 5 c. 2).<br>
<br>Freed on 16 February 1628, Pyne was almost immediately elected member of parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He was active in debate from April to June 1628, especially in support of the petition of right. In his final speech, on 5 June, on grievances against the duke of Buckingham, Pyne remarked, &#145;I think we can hardly tax the man in question without blaming a greater power&#146;  (Johnson and others, 4.131). By the autumn of 1628 Pyne was ailing. On 16 October he paid a fine to be discharged from his reading duties at Lincoln's Inn. On 19 November he made a codicil to his will in favour of his son-in-law Edmund Windham and his granddaughter Mabel Windham. He died at Cathanger, Somerset, on 21 November 1628. His son Arthur inherited Pyne's Somerset and Dorset leaseholds. His nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37873/', "John Pyne")</script>, son of Thomas Pyne (<i>d</i>. in or before 1609), had a parliamentary career that continued to 1653.<br>
