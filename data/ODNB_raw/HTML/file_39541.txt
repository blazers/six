<span class="headword">Green,  Roger Gilbert Lancelyn</span>  (1918&#150;1987), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 2 November 1918 at Swanington Hall, Norwich, Norfolk, the eldest of the four children of Gilbert Arthur Lancelyn Green (1887&#150;1947), major, Royal Field Artillery, and his wife, Helena Mary Phyllis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sealy (1885&#150;1972). The history of the family's 900 year-long association with the manors of Poulton-Lancelyn and Bebington is recorded in Roger Lancelyn Green's <span class="italic">Poulton-Lancelyn: the Story of an Ancestral Home</span> (1948). Although he claims his account is of &#145;an undistinguished country family&#146;  (Green, <span class="italic">Poulton-Lancelyn</span>), it is evident that Poulton Hall, its history and its famous Queen Anne library with the Revd Thomas Green's collection (4496 volumes), furnished the inner landscape of his life and work. Childhood illness interrupted his schooling at Dane Court, Pyrford, Surrey, and Liverpool College, but his father enjoyed reading aloud to his children the books of an earlier generation of writers: Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Andrew Lang, H. Rider Haggard, Harrison Ainsworth, Jeffery Farnol, and others. This upbringing left his son with impressions of childhood as a golden age suffused with literary romance and adventure, which he kept intact throughout a lifetime in a period of great social change.<br>
<br>At Merton College, Oxford (1937&#150;40), Green's interest in romantic fantasy was encouraged by his tutor, C. S. Lewis, whose friend, J. R. R. Tolkien, was writing <span class="italic">The Lord of the Rings</span>. Tolkien's 1939 lecture &#145;On fairy stories&#146; about the &#145;secondary world&#146; of the imagination confirmed Green's scholarly preferences for traditional fairy- and folk-tales, classical myths and legends, the Arthurian cycle, medieval romances, Norse sagas, the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, and Egyptian history, all of which would form the sources of his later writings. After taking his degree (1940) he had short spells as an actor in Oxford and London (Pirate Noodler in <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span>), a schoolmaster, and an antiquarian bookseller before returning to Oxford to take his MA degree and, tutored by Tolkien, to write his BLitt thesis on Andrew Lang (1944). He became deputy librarian of his college (1945&#150;50), had many friends, and pursued a literary career of individual connoisseurship. On 31 March 1948 he married June Burdett (<i>b</i>. 1926), actress and speech and drama examiner; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Green will be remembered for <span class="italic">Tellers of Tales</span>, (1946), a landmark and early example of serious consideration given to children's books as a distinctive literature. In his clear, urbane, man-of-letters style, he presents biographical descriptions of his favourite childhood authors, mostly those who lived between 1850 and 1920. Green's erudition and his acceptance of writing for children as an important literary activity made his book a great success as a source of reference, especially with teachers and librarians. Later editions (1953; 1965) addressed adults more directly, although by 1969, in the last edition, a number of his subjects had become topics of antiquarian interest for specialist readers. The Bodley Head monographs on <span class="italic">Lewis Carroll</span> (1960), <span class="italic">J. M. Barrie</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Mrs Molesworth</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Andrew Lang</span> (1962), all members of his pantheon, and of his tutor and friend <span class="italic">C. S. Lewis</span> (1963, revised 1969) show Green at his most characteristic. About his distinction as a writer there is no doubt. What he knew best he revisited on behalf of a wide range of readers. <span class="italic">The Story of Lewis Carroll</span> (1950) is for the young; their elders have his edition of Carroll's <span class="italic">Diaries</span> (1953), <span class="italic">The Lewis Carroll handbook: being a new version of a handbook of the literature of the Rev. C. L. Dodgson</span> (1962, rev. edn 1970), and <span class="italic">The Work of Lewis Carroll</span>, edited by John Tenniel (1965). Other editorial tributes include <span class="italic">The Readers' Guide to Rudyard Kipling's Work</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Kipling: the Critical Heritage</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">Plays and Stories of J. M. Barrie</span> (1962). Green's attachment to creators of &#145;secondary worlds&#146; is also clear in the somewhat hagiologic biography of C. S. Lewis that he wrote with Walter Hooper (1974).<br>
<br>As a critic, Green accepted literary values as self-evident. His biographical approach to children's books continued to influence other writings about them for at least twenty-five years after his essay &#145;The golden age of children's literature&#146; (1962, 59&#150;73). Later, Peter Hunt argued that Green was &#145;committed to books in a way that few of us could hope to be&#146;  (<span class="italic">Signal</span>, 56, 1988, 146) and &#145;the arcadia from which Green wrote is only available to us if we reject the world as it is&#146;  (ibid., 147). Nevertheless, Hunt admits that Green was &#145;one of the first to take children's literature into the more hallowed academic halls&#146;  (ibid., 148). Rarely committing himself to forthright opinions on the works of his contemporaries, Green brought to his own a distinctive kind of scholarly strength. Having tried his hand at writing conventional stories for children, he ruefully acknowledged that their settings in country houses were &#145;&#147;out of date&#148; and not sufficiently &#147;period&#148; to satisfy the critics&#146;  (Hammond, 335).<br>
<br>Green's continuing reputation rests on his retellings of tales he loved as a child and came to know intrinsically as a scholar. His anthologies owe much to his passion for collecting, as described in <span class="italic">Tellers of Tales</span>. But, rather than a simple bringing-together of distinctive genres, each book is a recreative enterprise. During the 1960s and 1970s this work included, for Dent: <span class="italic">Tales of Make-Believe</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Ten Tales of Detection</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Thirteen Uncanny Tales</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Tales of Terror and Fantasy</span> (from Edgar Allan Poe; 1971); and for Hamish Hamilton: <span class="italic">The Hamish Hamilton Book of Dragons</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Magicians</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Other Worlds</span> (1976). In retelling heroic legends Green stays as close as he can to his reading of the originals; in prefaces he lets his readers know about his sources in a way that engages them as fellow scholars. <span class="italic">King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table</span> (1953) has brought at least two generations of young readers as near to Malory as they are likely to get. The book has been continuously in print; a new edition was printed in 1994, and as a <span class="roman">Puffin Classic</span> it is also an audiobook (1998). Green's dignified, austere language is spell-binding for a more demotic age. The same effect is noticeable in <span class="italic">Heroes of Greece and Troy</span> and <span class="italic">The Tale of Israel</span> (1969). In <span class="italic">Mystery at Mycenae</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">The Luck of Troy</span> (1961), devotion to the world of Homer brought him the success in writing fiction and the attention of an audience that had eluded him earlier.<br>
<br>Green died of cancer at his home, Poulton Hall, Poulton Lancelyn, Bebington, Cheshire, on 8 October 1987, and was buried at St Andrew's Church, Bebington. By dint of his prolific exertions during his life as a country gentleman, he enhanced writing for children with his scholarship and won for himself a unique reputation. His academic distinctions included the William Noble research fellowship in English at the University of Liverpool (1950&#150;52), where he was later a member of council (1964&#150;70) and from which he was awarded an honorary degree of DLitt (1981). At the University of St Andrews (Scotland) he was the Andrew Lang lecturer in 1968. He edited the <span class="italic">Kipling Journal</span> from 1957 to 1975. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> (23 October 1987) recorded that children's literature had &#145;lost a pioneering researcher and an eloquent advocate&#146;.<br>
