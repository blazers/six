<span class="headword">Hessey,  James Augustus</span>  (1814&#150;1892), <span class="occ">headmaster and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in St Bride's, London, on 17 July 1814, the eldest son of James Augustus Hessey and his wife, Catherine. His father, a bookseller and printer in partnership with John Taylor at 93 Fleet Street, had published early work by Keats and owned the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> (1821&#150;5). Hessey was educated at Merchant Taylors' School from 1823 until 1832, when he matriculated at St John's College, Oxford. He graduated BA in 1836, taking a first class in the classical school, MA in 1840, BD in 1845, and DCL in 1846. A fellow of his college from 1832 to 1846, he was an examiner at Oxford (1842&#150;4), and published an analysis of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> for undergraduate use (1845). In 1839 he held the vicarage of Hellidon, Northamptonshire, relinquishing the living on his appointment to a college lectureship.<br>
<br>On 23 July 1845 Hessey was appointed headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School. His period of office was one of &#145;unspectacular modernisation&#146;  (Draper, 163). His natural charm helped to persuade both the boys and the autocratic governing body, the Merchant Taylors' Company, to accept changes in existing customs and practices, bringing the school more into line with other public schools. He gave evidence to the Clarendon commission (28 June 1862). On 27 July 1847 he married Emma, second daughter of the stockbroker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47717/', "Philip Cazenove")</script> of Clapham Common. He was preacher of Gray's Inn from 1850 to 1879, and was appointed by A. C. Tait, bishop of London, to the prebendal stall of Oxgate, in St Paul's Cathedral, which he held until 1875.<br>
<br>Hessey resigned the headmastership in December 1870, shortly after his appointment by the bishop of London, John Jackson (1811&#150;1885), as one of his examining chaplains. An orthodox churchman, he was particularly active in opposing changes to the laws of marriage, publishing in 1850 <span class="italic">A Scripture Argument Against Permitting Marriage with a Wife's Sister</span> (3rd edn, 1855). He preached the Bampton lectures at Oxford, published as <span class="italic">Sunday, its Origin, History, and Present Obligation</span> (1860; 5th edn, 1889). In 1865 and again in 1867 he was elected Grinfield lecturer on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> at Oxford. His Boyle lectures for 1871&#150;3 were entitled <span class="italic">Moral Difficulties Connected with the Bible</span> (1871&#150;3). In June 1875 he was appointed archdeacon of Middlesex. A scholarly and urbane clergyman he was elected in 1879 a member of the club Nobody's Friends. In 1878 and 1879 he was select preacher in the University of Cambridge. He was also one of the three permanent chairmen of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and an active member of nearly all the church societies. In 1884 the University of the South, Tennessee, conferred upon him the degree of DD. Hessey died at his home, 41 Leinster Gardens, Hyde Park, London, on 24 December 1892.<br>
