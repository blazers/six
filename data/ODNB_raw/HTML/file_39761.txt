<span class="headword">Blanchard,  Thomas</span>  (1760&#150;1797), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, baptized at Bulmer, Yorkshire, on 16 June 1760, was born into a theatrical family. His father, the elder Thomas Blanchard (<i>fl</i>. 1760&#150;1787), was a seasoned actor who built a reputation for himself at York and Norwich before joining the Drury Lane company in 1773; his mother, Elizabeth, also enjoyed a theatrical career. The younger Thomas Blanchard was prepared for a life on the stage as a young child, when he was taught to sing and dance. He is thought to have made his theatrical d&eacute;but in Norwich when he was about twelve, and in October 1773 he joined his father at Drury Lane, making his first appearance as Cupid in Whitehead's <span class="italic">A Trip to Scotland</span>. He took a number of juvenile parts in the 1773&#150;4 season, the most notable being Prince Arthur in Garrick's production of <span class="italic">King John</span>, and he remained with the Drury Lane company for a further year, singing and playing juvenile roles, before embarking upon a career as an adult actor in the small provincial theatres of Plymouth and Exeter. After two years he was spotted by the managers of the Theatre Royal, Bath, who engaged him for the 1778&#150;9 season. He became popular with the audience there, achieving particular applause as a singer of rustic songs and as a hornpipe dancer.<br>
<br>For the next four years Blanchard toured the west of England with a small troupe of players, though he rejoined the Bath company in 1783. On 19 May 1787 he married Charlotte Wright (<i>b</i>. 1761), the daughter of the actor Roger Wright. Miss Wright was already a singer of some repute, having performed at Drury Lane between 1779 and 1783. Following their marriage the Blanchards moved from Bath to London, Thomas having agreed terms with Thomas Harris to join the company at Covent Garden. He made his d&eacute;but there on 3 October 1788, playing the part of Hodge in Bickerstaffe's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>. Blanchard remained at Covent Garden for several seasons, becoming famous for his comic portrayal of simple, rustic characters, notable among them the part of Sim in John O'Keefe's <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>. Haslewood records the extent of his popularity at this time, attributing it to the actor's &#145;unaffected simplicity, and native humour on the Stage, his affability and laudable conduct off it&#146;  (Haslewood, 212).<br>
<br>However, despite the warmth of his reception on the London stage, Blanchard was afflicted with chronic stage fright. In an effort to subdue his frequent bouts of anxiety, the actor appears to have turned increasingly to alcohol. He continued to perform at Covent Garden until the end of the 1793&#150;4 season, when he was summarily dismissed from the company on account of his excessive drinking. He then travelled to Scotland, where he accepted an offer from Stephen Kemble to appear at the theatre in Edinburgh. According to the account given in <span class="italic">The Thespian Dictionary</span>, Kemble was aware of Blanchard's fondness for alcohol and tried his utmost to ensure that his new recruit remained sober. On the afternoon of his Edinburgh d&eacute;but, Kemble invited Blanchard to dinner, thinking it the easiest way to prevent him from becoming drunk. However, while Kemble slept in his armchair, Blanchard helped himself to a bottle of the theatre manager's best brandy. Kemble awoke to discover his star actor insensible, and was obliged to cancel the evening performance. Despite this inauspicious start, Blanchard remained with Kemble's company for two seasons.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1796 Blanchard returned to London. Unable to find work in the theatres, he was obliged to perform at the circus in St George's Fields. At the beginning of the 1797 season he was engaged by the Fishamble Street theatre in Dublin. However, his tenure with that company lasted only a few weeks. He died at his lodgings in Hamilton Row on 30 December 1797, a victim of &#145;the fatigue he underwent in the late storms&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 67, 1797, 1134). He was buried in St Mark's churchyard, Dublin, in January 1798. Charlotte Blanchard continued her stage career after her husband's death, appearing in Dublin and Limerick in 1798. Blanchard's daughters, Elizabeth and Charlotta, also enjoyed brief stage careers. His only son, Thomas John Blanchard (1789&#150;1859), became a pantomime actor.<br>
