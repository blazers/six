<span class="headword">Ewing <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McAdam; <em>married name </em>Bain]</span>,  Margaret Anne</span>  (1945&#150;2006), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 September 1945 at Fairhaven, Hyndford Road, Lanark, the daughter of John McAdam, ploughman, later builder's labourer, and his wife, Margaret Jamieson Cuthbert (Peggie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lamb. She was born to the rural working class rather like Chris Guthrie, heroine of Lewis Grassic Gibbon's <span class="italic">A Scots Quair</span> (1932&#150;34), whom in passion and radicalism she resembled. She retained an interest in rural affairs and the environment throughout her life. She attended the primary and high school at Biggar from 1950 to 1962, with the exception of the years 1957&#150;8, when she was recovering from tuberculosis. After graduating with a second-class degree in French from Glasgow University in 1967 and taking a teacher training course at Jordanhill College she became an assistant teacher at Our Lady's High School in the then new town of Cumbernauld. In 1970 she moved to St Modan's High School, Stirling, as a special assistant teacher, and from 1973 principal teacher for remedial education. Her childhood illness and work as a remedial teacher gave her an empathy and a quality of kindness that made even her political opponents regard her with affection. On 20 July 1968 she had married a political scientist, Donald Straiton Bain, son of Donald Bain, veterinary surgeon. Both were already active in the Scottish National Party (SNP), and in the early 1970s her husband became an economic adviser to the party. Along with Gordon Wilson he investigated and impressively deployed the cause of North Sea oil, which won Margo MacDonald the Govan by-election in November 1973 on the eve of the report of the Kilbrandon commission. Also in 1973, Margaret Bain (by now a member of the SNP national executive) gained the nomination for East Dunbartonshire (really Cumbernauld New Town).<br>
<br>1974 brought two general elections. Margaret Bain was heavily defeated in February but was returned to the House of Commons in the October contest with the truly hairsbreadth majority of 22 votes in a close three-way contest. In a sense, however, the election had already shot the SNP's fox. Labour, after conceding the principle of devolution, started to recover. By the autumn of 1977 it was steadily winning by-elections against the SNP. Margaret Bain, tall, arresting, blonde, and described by one parliamentarian not normally regarded as a chauvinist as having &#145;the best legs in the house since the eighteenth century&#146;  (private information), settled in well at Westminster, but her party's chances were soon ebbing away. A left-wing Scottish Labour Party was founded in 1975 by Jim Sillars as compromises were written into Labour's bill, most notoriously when a Scottish-born London MP, George Cunningham, inserted an amendment requiring a minimum &#145;yes&#146; vote of 40 per cent of the <i>entire</i> electorate. The referendum took place on 1 March 1979 during the bleakest winter in years, complicated by endemic labour problems. In Scotland the &#145;yes&#146; vote was carried by a small margin, but failed to reach the 40 per cent threshold; in Wales devolution was rejected outright. The prime minister, James Callaghan, tabled the repeal of the bill: the eleven SNP MPs countered with a vote of no confidence. In this Plaid Cymru ultimately took Labour's side, but on a motion of no confidence carried by only one vote on 1 April the Labour government was forced to the polls. In the election of May 1979 Bain lost her seat by a wide margin, coming third behind both the Labour and the Conservative candidates.<br>
<br>The aftermath of the 1979 election was scarcely less traumatic for the SNP. A left-wing pressure group, the '79 Group, headed up by Jim Sillars, now in the SNP, attracted many talented younger members, including Alex Salmond. In this confrontation Margaret Bain (who supported herself as a freelance journalist and later co-ordinator of the west of Scotland certificate in social service scheme) took the side of the party establishment against what was perceived as a &#145;party within a party&#146;, and supported the group's expulsion in 1982 (they were readmitted in 1983). She contested Strathkelvin and Bearsden, unsuccessfully, in 1983 and was senior vice-chair of the party from 1984 to 1987. Meanwhile her marriage to Donald Bain had ended in 1980, and on 30 November 1983 she married Fergus Stewart Ewing (<i>b</i>. 1957), solicitor and politician, son of Stewart Martin Ewing, lecturer in tax legislation, and his wife Winifred Ewing, then MEP for the Highlands and Islands in the European parliament (having previously served as SNP MP for Hamilton in 1967&#150;70 and Moray and Nairn from 1974 to 1979).<br>
<br>In 1987 Margaret Ewing returned to the House of Commons as MP for Moray and Nairn, retaining the seat in the elections of 1992 and 1997. She followed her mother-in-law in involving herself in European matters through the Commons select committee on European legislation from 1987 to 1999. In 1990, when the Soviet Union was about to invade Lithuania, democratic forces had barricaded themselves in the parliament buildings. Margaret Ewing took up their cause and set out with volunteers to support President Landsbergis, much to the apprehension of her colleagues. She was also deeply committed to improving the condition of elderly people and children. She was widely respected for her compassion and reasonableness, her assiduousness on behalf of constituents, and the sincerity of her nationalist beliefs. From 1987 to 1999 she was leader of the SNP parliamentary group, and in 1990 was widely tipped to succeed Gordon Wilson as party leader, but in the event was defeated at the party conference by Alex Salmond, by 486 votes to 186.<br>
<br>Following the success of the 1997 referendum on devolution, Margaret Ewing was returned for Moray to the new Scottish parliament in July 1999, and held a dual mandate until 2001, when she gave up her Westminster seat. Her husband meanwhile served as SNP member of the Scottish parliament for Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, and her mother-in-law for the Highlands and Islands. In April 2002 Margaret Ewing was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. She took six months off but was returned to the Scottish parliament for Moray in 2003. In this session she took a particular interest in Africa and led a delegation to Malawi, which decided on a partnership with Scotland. According to her husband &#145;She insisted it was too important a cause to ignore&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Record</span>, 24 March 2006). She recovered from the breast cancer therapy, but the long-term impact gravely impaired her health and increased her liability first to pneumonia, then to anaemia. She died suddenly of a heart attack at her home, Burns Cottage, Tulloch's Brae, Lossiemouth, Moray, on 21 March 2006, while dealing with constituents' correspondence. The widespread affection she enjoyed was reflected in the turnout at her funeral, at St Geraldine's High Church, Lossiemouth, on 25 March. She was survived by her husband Fergus. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
