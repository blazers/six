<span class="headword">Bodi <span class="st"> [Bode]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1357), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and scholastic writer</span>, graduated doctor of divinity at Oxford University. His institutional affiliation is not known, but he might have been attached to Gloucester College, which was established for monks of his order. His personal circumstances are known only from an incident in which a friar was ordered by the university to make a public apology for having made insulting references to him in a lecture of 20 December 1357. The following January Bodi witnessed a disclaimer made by the Augustinian friars of Oxford in St Mary's Church. However, he is known chiefly from a work in the best fourteenth-century Oxford tradition of applying logical techniques to the analysis of problems that were superficially physical. There were at Oxford at this time disputations based on sophisms, intended as an aid to learning logic. Those who took part were the more advanced students&#151;who thus became known as <i>sophistae</i>. The disputations could be held outside the schools, but were supervised by masters, or possibly bachelors. Although the physics was not usually introduced for its own sake so much as for the sake of disputation, the activity was occasionally the source of useful new physical concepts, and the resulting Oxford literature brought the &#145;calculators&#146; a certain European reputation for ingenuity.<br>
<br>Bodi's only known work (beginning <span class="italic">A est unum calidum</span>) is a collection of twenty-two sophisms in this tradition. Of three known copies of the text, one is ascribed to John Bodi (that in Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Vat. lat. 4447). It is of some interest for its treatment of infinite series, which in the two previous decades had given rise to much activity centred on what were seen as paradoxical arguments. The series were handled intelligently, by the rearrangement and manipulation of terms. They were not regarded as a part of an abstract mathematics, however, but as part of a calculus of qualities&#151;in particular degrees of heat, which were typically reckoned to be only eight in number. Bodi's work, on the other hand, cannot be considered as a contribution to a physical theory of heat, for it dealt only with imaginary problems, without any empirical basis. It was probably without much influence, by comparison with the work of his mid-fourteenth-century contemporaries Richard Swineshead and William Heytesbury. Pierre Duhem was under the impression that <span class="italic">A est unum calidum</span> was written under the influence of the ideas of Nicole Oresme (<i>d</i>. 1382), but Anneliese Maier&#151;who first identified Bodi as the author of the collection&#151;showed that this was not the case.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Bodi's later career or death. A John Body who was fellow of Merton College in 1338, possibly already by 1334, and about whom it seems nothing else is known, was fairly certainly not the Benedictine of that name.<br>
