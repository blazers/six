<span class="headword">Hargreaves,  James</span>  (1834&#150;1915), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer and inventor</span>, was born in May 1834, at Hoarstones, Pendle Forest, Lancashire, the eldest of the seven sons of John Hargreaves, a schoolmaster. Hargreaves's education began at his father's school in Slaithwaite. In 1844 his father left schoolmastering to become a druggist and Hargreaves was introduced to medicine and chemistry. In 1856 he turned to technical chemistry, especially the problem of recovering sulphur from alkali waste. John Mercer persuaded him to contact William Gossage, who had been experimenting on similar lines, and in 1859 Hargreaves joined Gossage's soap works. Here he invented methods for recovering chromates used for bleaching oils and fats in soap manufacture and bleaching common brown soap. He was also the first to prepare blue mottled soap.<br>
<br>After leaving Gossage in 1865, Hargreaves worked for two other soap manufacturers in Runcorn and Liverpool. In 1871 he and his youngest brother, John, set up as consulting chemists in Widnes. Turning to metallurgy, James proposed a modification of the Bessemer process for the manufacture of steel, using sodium nitrate instead of air. James Heaton of Widnes tried this on a small scale at Langley Mill, Nottinghamshire, but the cost proved too high. Hargreaves also devised a method for recovering phosphorus from blast-furnace slag; the by-product, ferric chloride, was converted into ferric oxide and chlorine.<br>
<br>About 1872 Hargreaves, with Thomas Robinson, an iron-founder, invented a process and plant for making salt-cake from salt without using sulphuric acid. The Atlas Chemical Company, Widnes, was formed in 1873 to make salt-cake and hydrochloric acid by Hargreaves's method. Hot gases from pyrites burners, mixed with steam, were passed over small blocks of moulded salt, a process which worked successfully for many years; the works was absorbed by the United Alkali Company in 1890 and the last Hargreaves&#150;Robinson salt-cake plant closed in 1918.<br>
<br>With Thomas Bird, an electrical engineer, Hargreaves about 1893 invented an electrolytic process for decomposing common salt, using an asbestos diaphragm. After trials the General Electrolytic Alkali Company was established in 1899 with Hargreaves as a director, and production began at Cledford Bridge near Middlewich in 1901. In 1914 the company was reorganized as Electro-Bleach and By-products Ltd. The process, which was highly efficient, was extensively adopted in Europe and America.<br>
<br>Hargreaves's inventions were numerous and diverse; besides his innovations in the soap, alkali, metallurgical, and electrochemical industries, his &#145;thermo-motor&#146; anticipated the idea of the diesel engine, and he was among the first to advocate the use of gaseous chlorine for treating sewage. Shrewd in business, he had a ready wit and a distinctive appearance, with a full beard and piercing eyes.<br>
<br>The name of Hargreaves's wife and the date of their marriage is unknown but they had one son and five or six daughters. Hargreaves died at 32 Sayce Street, Widnes, on 4 April 1915.<br>
